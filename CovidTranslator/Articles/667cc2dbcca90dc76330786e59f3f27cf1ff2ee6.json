Tissue samples taken from the respiratory tract of diseased dogs were tested for the presence of coronaviruses using RT-PCR with conserved primers for the polymerase gene. Sequence analysis of four positive samples showed the presence of a coronavirus with high similarity to both bovine and human coronavirus (strain OC43) in their polymerase and spike genes, whereas there was a low similarity to comparable genes in the enteric canine coronavirus. This canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCV) was detected by RT-PCR in 32/119 tracheal and 20/119 lung samples, with the highest prevalence being detected in dogs with mild clinical symptoms. Serological analysis showed that the presence of antibodies against CRCV on the day of entry into the kennel decreased the risk of developing respiratory disease.",

Also, canine herpesvirus, human reovirus, and mycoplasma species have been isolated from dogs with symptoms of CIRD (Karpas et al., 1968; Lou and Wenner, 1963; Randolph et al., 1993) . Experimental infection of dogs with single infectious agents has been shown to cause only mild respiratory symptoms but failed to reproduce the severe disease that can be seen in natural outbreaks, supporting the theory that the pathogenesis of CIRD is multifactorial (Appel and Percy, 1970; Karpas et al., 1968; Bemis et al., 1977b) .",

Studies using the human coronavirus strain 229E have shown that coronaviruses can cause disruption of the respiratory epithelium and ciliary dyskinesia (Chilvers et al., 2001) . If one supposes that an infection with CRCV may have a similar effect then the virus could play an important role in the early stages of the pathogenesis of CIRD. By damage of the respiratory epithelium and disruption of the ciliary clearance CRCV could facilitate the entry of other viral or bacterial pathogens causing the more severe respiratory symptoms. The less frequent detection of CRCV in tissue samples from dogs with more severe disease may be explained by the destruction of the respiratory epithelium by other microorganisms in the advanced stages of CIRD. At the same time it is likely that the immune response that is induced by CRCV in almost all dogs would help to clear the infection, causing the prevalence of CRCV RNA to be lower in later stages of the disease.",
