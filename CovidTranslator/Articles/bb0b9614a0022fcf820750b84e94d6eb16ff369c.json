This includes financial risk protection, access to quality essential health care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. Universal health coverage (UHC) means inclusion and empowerment for all people to access medical care, including treatment and prevention services. UHC exists in all the industrial nations except the US, which has a mixed public-private system and struggles with closing the gap between the insured and the uninsured population. Middle-and low-income countries face many challenges for UHC achievement, including low levels of funding, lack of personnel, weak health management, and issues of availability of services favoring middle-and upper-class communities. Community health services for preventive and curative health services for needs in populations at risk for poor health in low-income countries must be addressed with proactive health promotion initiatives for the double burden of infectious and noncommunicable diseases. Each nation will develop its own unique approach to national health systems, but there are models used by a number of countries based on principles of national responsibility for health, social solidarity for providing funding, and for effective ways of providing care with comprehensiveness, efficiency, quality, and cost containment. Universal access does not eliminate social inequalities in health by itself, including a wide context of reducing social inequities. Understanding national health systems requires examining representative models of different systems.",

Most industrialized countries have implemented national health programs such as health insurance systems or national health services. Each system developed in the political, social, and historical context of the country-and continues to evolve. Medium-and lowincome countries are also struggling to achieve universal access to care and health for all by expanding primary health care and social security plans which provide benefits to workers and for certain vulnerable populations-primarily mothers and children. As they move up the scale of economic development, developing countries must also address the problem of how to decrease morbidity and mortality, achieve equity in access to health care, and expand the funding basis for health care through national health insurance. Some countries experience rapid economic development, but lag behind in directing increased national wealth towards improving health status. This is often due to a lack of focused political commitment, trained policy analysts, and cultural adaptation to the crucial importance of public health. Each national health system has its own characteristics and challenges. Systems management requires continuous evaluation based on welldeveloped information systems, trained health management personnel, societal involvement through all levels of government, as well as the private sector, professional organizations and advocacy groups. There is no defined \"gold standard\" plan for providing universal access to health care that is suitable for all countries. Each country develops and modifies a program of national health appropriate to its own political and cultural needs and available resources. However, there are evolving patterns in health care organization, so that networking within and between countries ensures that they can-and do-learn from one another (Box 8.2).",

Removing financial barriers to care is necessary and constructive, but not sufficient to address the health problems of individuals and of a society. Equity in financial access with universal coverage is vital to population and individual health since anyone can have serious illness at any time. But equally important, long-term preventive care and health promotion are essential to good population and individual health standards. Inequities exist in all societies, but many countries have successfully reduced these by poverty alleviation, job creation, education, and other programs that reduce interregional, socioeconomic, and demographic differences in health. Special attention to high-risk groups in a population is essential. Groups at-risk may be based on age, gender, ethnicity, genetic legacy, occupation, risky lifestyle, location of residence, religion, sexual orientation, economic status, or other factors that increase susceptibility to disease, premature death, or disability. Services must be based on need and not only demand, which can escalate costs by over-servicing. Health systems planning needs to promote access to patient care, but also those services that reach the entire population, especially people at high risk who are often least able to seek and access appropriate care.",

            "text": "The foundations of public responsibility for health care systems go back to ancient Greece and Rome where city states employed municipal doctors to service the poor and slaves. In the Medieval and Renaissance periods, monasteries and nunneries provided charitable care to the poor while professional guilds provided prepaid medical care and other social benefits to members and their families. These later evolved into the Friendly (benevolent) Societies, as mutual benefit programs that provided for burials, pensions, and payment for health services for members. In the twentieth century, these developed through collective bargaining into health insurance plans through private or professionally sponsored insurers, and labor union\u00c0sponsored health plans. Governmental responsibility for health systems evolved in public health and health protection systems in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and continues to evolve to face new challenges as well as preventive and treatment capacities. The health systems described highlight the unique and common features of national health systems in the search for \"health for all\", and policies for making health a priority in resource allocation, policy priority for human rights, and for socioeconomic development. Figure 8 .1 indicates the 1995\u00c02014 trends in total health expenditures as percent of Gross Domestic Products of selected countries in the European Region of WHO. German and Swedish expenditures rose to between 11% and 12%, in the United Kingdom to over 9% while Israel is relatively stable under 8% and the Russian Federation expenditures rose to 7% of GDP. Germany's health care system today is characterized by participation as well as sharing of decision-making powers between the states (La\u00a8nder), the federal government and civil society organizations. Since 2009, Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) has been mandatory for all citizens and permanent residents pay a uniform contribution of 15.5 percent of their income (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung) with 118 sickness funds (Krankenkassen, January 2016). SHI covers 85 percent of the population, who have the right to choose their preferred sickness fund for a comprehensive range of services. The sickness funds are linked to associations of physicians accredited to treat patients covered by SHI. Private health insurance (PHI) covers 11 percent of the population for designated groups such as civil servants. Others (4%) such as the military are included in other specific governmental programs. Since the 1990s financial incentives are being introduced to improve quality and efficiency of care along with beneficiaries right to choose between sickness funds increasing competition and a market orientation. Hospitals are paid by diagnosis related groups (DRGs)-i.e., payment by diagnostic category rather than hospital length of stay, adopted from US experience. Physicians are paid by a capitation system-i.e., a fixed payment for each person registered for care with a doctor for a fixed period of time (as opposed to fee-for-service) in the doctor's medical associations. Longterm care is covered by a federal mandatory program. Germany expends 11.3 percent of GDP (2015) on health, one of the highest levels among EU members, with 73 percent from public sources and 27 percent privately sourced. In 2014, Germany had 6.2 acute care beds per 1,000 beds per 1000 population, nearly 40 percent above the rate for the original EU countries (3.8 per 1,000).

In 1911, initiated by Lloyd-George, influenced by the German compulsory health insurance scheme, the Liberal government of Great Britain introduced the National Health Insurance Act. It was compulsory for all wage earners between 16 and 70 years of age. This was a two-part plan based on a worker and employer contributory system for both unemployment insurance and for medical care for workers and their families. Administration was through approved mutual benefit societies (the Friendly Societies), some based on insurance companies, and others by professional associations and trade unions. General practitioner services were paid on a capitation basis rather than a salary, preserving their status as self-employed professionals. Initially this plan covered one-third of the population increasing to half by 1940, however there was disruption due to mass unemployment during the Great Depression starting in 1929 and continuing to the late 1930s.",

During World War II, at the behest of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Beveridge developed a postwar social reconstruction program. The Beveridge Report of 1942, Social Insurance and Health Services, outlined the concept of a future welfare state including a national health service, placing medical care in the context of general social policy for the total population.

The National Health Service (NHS) Act was instituted in 1948 under the leadership of Aneurin Bevan, against continued opposition from medical organizations, as a universal state health service in Britain. The NHS provides a nationally tax-based financed, universal coverage system providing free care by general practitioners, specialists, hospitals, and public health services. This includes diagnosis and treatment of illnesses at home or in hospital, including dental and optometric care. The original NHS structure was divided into three separate services: hospital, general practitioner, and community health services. The hospital and specialist services were under the authority of 14 regional boards. General practitioners worked under national contracts, and community health services, such as public health, home nursing and health visitors, midwives, maternal-and child care, came under the control of the county and city local authorities. All units reported to the minister of health and his staff. The hospital bed supply in the UK in 2014 was just under half the rate in France and one third of the rate of beds in Germany per 1,000 population. Hospital based specialists are salaried but highly independent; general practitioners ran their own practices and provided the foundation of the NHS system. Over time, this tripartite structure evolved to some degree of integration of GP and community health services, along with hospitals under Hospital Trusts reporting to Regional Health Authorities. The NHS, with periodic reforms, is still in place in the UK and well accepted by the population and-over time-even by conservative governments and by the medical profession.",

The Marmot Report on inequalities from 2010 indicated the scope of the problem: \"People living in the most deprived neighborhoods will on average die seven years earlier than people living in the richest neighborhoods. Even more disturbing, people living in poorer areas not only die sooner, but spend more of their lives with disability-an average total difference of 17 years. The review has estimated the cost of health inequalities in England: productivity losses of d31\u00c033 billion every year; lost taxes and higher welfare payments in the range of d20\u00c032 billion per year; and additional NHS healthcare costs well in excess of d5.5 billion per year.\"",

In 1956 a federal cost-sharing formula began providing approximately 50 percent cost-sharing with greater levels of funding going to the poorer provinces. By 1961, all 10 Provinces and two Territories had implemented hospital insurance plans, in a twotiered national health insurance plan-i.e., universal provincial/territorial health plans with federal standards and cost-sharing. In 1962, again in Saskatchewan, the medical care insurance plan (Medicare) was implemented after a bitter doctors' strike. In 1961, the federal government appointed a Royal Commission on Health Services (the Hall Commission) which in 1964 recommended adoption of the Saskatchewan model across the country with federal support and standards. The Saskatchewan plan was rapidly followed by similar plans in other provinces encouraged by generous federal costsharing.",

This, and the wish to maintain population health, led President Roosevelt to initiate regulations in 1941 for fortification of \"enriched\" foods reaching a majority of the population including salt with iodine, flour with iron and vitamin B complex, and milk with vitamin D. During World War II (1941\u00c045), governmental health insurance was provided to many millions of Americans serving in the armed forces, along with their families. At the same time, health benefits through voluntary insurance for workers were vastly expanded in place of wage increases and this became the major method of prepayment for health care for a majority of the population. At the end of the war, millions of veterans were eligible for health care through the Veterans Administration (VA), which established a national network of federal hospitals and primary care services.",

The plethora of health insurance systems fostered high costs and restrictions on access due to pre-existing conditions. Other factors for rapid cost increases included an increasing elderly population, high levels of morbidity in the poor population, the spread of AIDS, rapid innovation and costly medical technology, specialization, high laboratory and diagnostic imaging costs, and large-scale public investment in medical education, research and health facility construction. The US system includes a mix of public health insurance and service programs (Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration, Indian Health services, and military health coverage) which provide for a significant part-36.5 percent in 2014-of the US population. However, the majority (66%) is covered by the private insurance industry through employer-employee contracts which developed rapidly as the dominant health insurance sector with minimal government regulation. The cost of private health insurance to employers included in labor contracts of their employees and pensioners has become very high. In 2008, General Motors reported to a Senate hearing that the cost of health insurance per car produced was double the direct cost of labor and more than the cost of steel per car. This impinged on competitiveness in price with for example with Japan which has a successful universal governmental health insurance plan with public-private mix of services.",

High-income countries spent more, and mostly from public sources, increasing expenditures by an estimated three percent per year. Medium income countries increased their health spending more than three-four percent per year and low-income countries by two percent. Economic development was positively associated with total health spending and a gradual shift away from a reliance on development assistance and out-of-pocket spending towards government spending. In 2014, 59.2 percent of all health spending was financed by the government, although in low-income and lower-middleincome countries, 29 percent and 58 percent of spending was out-of-pocket, 35.7 percent and three percent respectively was with development assistance. Recent growth in development assistance for health has been tepid. Between 2010 and 2016, it grew annually at 1.8 percent, and reached USD $37 \u00c1 6 billion in 2016. Nonetheless, there is a great deal of variation revolving around these averages. In 2016 countries spending less than five percent of GDP on health, included many in Asia, the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa (Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, 2016). While there is wide variation in health spending in low-and lowermiddle-income countries and there is overall increased spending in absolute terms, there is still a heavy reliance on out-of-pocket spending and development assistance, which itself is growing very slowly. This indicates that medium-and low-income countries are not providing the financial means to develop universal health access insurance plans.

Loss of health coverage with change of place of employment and the rapidly increasing cost of private health insurance generated widespread pressure for a national health program. The business community, too, loses confidence in voluntary health insurance as costs of health insurance mounted rapidly and as a cost of employment in an increasingly harms the competitive international business climate.",

The MDGs and SDGs represent a growing movement of globalization of health with economic and political dimensions and greater stress on human rights to health policy. They are particularly relevant to LMICs (low-and middle-income countries), but high-income countries have health inequalities that require new approaches based on outreach poverty abatement, and health promotion concepts. MDGs and SDGs presented a challenge to establish common data systems for performance measures to monitor effectiveness of policies and programs. This helps to build capacity for target-oriented health planning in low-and middle-income countries (LMICS). A holistic view of Health for All must take into account the many reasons for health disparities and disadvantage to the poor in health status. Insurance to pay for doctors, hospitals, laboratories and imaging centers is necessary, but not sufficient, to raise population health standards for all. The \"nontariff barriers\"-i.e., issues beyond payment for services which may be addressed with incentives in payment systems, not only to reduce hospital length-of-stay, but to reduce health-care acquired infections, reaching out to chronically ill people with health promotion measures such as nutritional support, pneumonia and influenza immunization, hypertension control, cancer screening, and many other features of public health promotion.",

National health insurance systems developed through social security and social welfare systems, by national health insurance, or options to provide access to health services. In Canada national health insurance provides universal coverage through national support for provincial health plans, paid for by general taxation, with national criteria. In the United States, President Lyndon Johnson established Social Security-based health insurance for the elderly and the poor through amendments to the Social Security Act of 1935, and President Barack Obama extended health insurance through the Affordable Care Act of 2010. The UK National Health Service-with the Northern Ireland, Scottish and Welsh NHS run semi-independently-was established in 1948, providing a state-run system of medical, hospital, preventive, and community health care. Though not discussed here, Nordic and other European health systems provide universal coverage with involvement from all three levels of government, but over 80 percent of expenditures are funded through public sources. In Denmark, Norway and Sweden county councils are central to funding and management; in Finland, the municipalities provide most of the health care.",

The objectives and specific targets included: reducing poverty, improving equal access of boys and girls to primary education, reducing child and maternal mortality, managing significant diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, along with improving the environment. Reaching the targets for achieving these goals depends on developing infrastructures of health systems that provide access for all and distribution to meet geographic and social inequities in health. Each country needs to develop its own system, but can learn from the experience of others. The purpose of this case study is to highlight the unique and common features, including positive and negative lessons learned from national health systems. Observing and learning can help in defining needs for countries lacking but aspiring to achieve universal health systems, including positive and negative challenges.",

Universal access systems have been achieved in most industrialized countries. However, the US has not achieved this goal even with, by far, the highest health expenditures of OECD countries. This is due mainly to political gridlock despite success with its single payer system for Medicare for the elderly. For low-income countries, the rates of health expenditures at present and forecast for the coming decades will be insufficient to achieve universal access systems. There must be a fundamental political change in national policies with health as a higher priority for funding and leadership. Universal healthcare access is still a work in progress.",

In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson introduced Medicare for the aged (over age 65), plus disabled persons, and persons on renal dialysis as an amendment (Title XVII) to the 1935 Social Security Act (SSA). Medicare covers hospitalization, skilled nursing home-based care, medical appliances, and other benefits with copayments. Medicaid, Title XIX of the SSA, also enacted in 1965 by President Johnson, provided federal cost-sharing for acceptable state health plans for the poor, with local authority participation. Medicaid is financed through shared responsibilities primarily of the federal, state and local governments. Medicaid has seen substantial increases in adult and children enrollees through expansions of eligibility, such as the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) extending Medicaid to large numbers of children. Medicare and Medicaid together brought about 25 percent of Americans into public systems of health insurance. Limitations included variable definitions of poverty for Medicaid eligibility in each state, and copayments for Medicare beneficiaries. The population enrolled in Medicare increased from 19 million in 1966 to 55.5 million in 2015, including disabled persons under the age of 65. The Medicaid enrolled population increased from 28.2 million in 1991 to 49.3 million in 2006 and to 65 million in 2017, or about one of every five persons in the United States. This contributed to increasing public sector health expenditures rising from under 25 percent of total health expenditures in 1960 to 47.7 percent in 2009, of concern for both critics and supporters of public health care programs.",
