[7] CNEPA calculated individual pollution indices for five major air pollutants including particulate matter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ground-level ozone (O 3 ), and carbon monoxide (CO). The maximal individual pollution index was set as the comprehensive API for the monitoring area. In most of monitoring areas, PM10 was considered as a major pollutant. [7] API could be categorized into seven groups with 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 as the cut-off points. APIs less than 100 were thought healthy for general population. Since the majority of patients were diagnosed during April and May, the average of daily APIs collected within these months in each region was used for data analyses mainly. In addition, to evaluate potential influence of long-term exposure to air pollution on the case fatality rate, the average of APIs between June 2000 and October 2002 before SARS epidemic was also analyzed.",

Among them, 349 died from the disease and the rest recovered, which accounted for the case fatality of 6.55%. The average APIs ranged from 52 to 126 for different regions during April and May 2003. Ecologic analysis was conducted among 5 regions with 100 or more SARS cases (Guangdong, Shanxi, Hebei, Beijing, and Tianjin) to explore the relationship between air pollution and SARS case fatality. Inner Mongolia, which had 282 probable cases, was excluded from the analysis due to poor data quality reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control. Table 1) We also studied the effect of long-term average air pollution before SARS epidemic on SARS fatality. According to the air pollution data between June 2000 and October 2002, 67 out of 1,572 patients from regions with low APIs died from SARS. While, 35 out of 363 from regions with moderate APIs and 247 out of 3,392 from regions with high APIs died from SARS, respectively. The corresponding fatalities were 4.26%, 9.64% and 7.28%, respectively.

            "text": "Our analyses showed that air pollution was associated with increased risk of dying from SARS. The biological explanation might be that long-term or short-term exposure to certain air pollutants could compromise lung function, therefore increasing SARS fatality. Both long-term and short-term exposure to air pollution has been associated with a variety of adverse health effects including acute respiratory inflammation, asthma and COPD. [3] [4] [5] [6] 9] Air pollution may predispose the respiratory epithelium of SARS patients, leading to severe respiratory symptoms and an increased risk of deaths. The adverse effect of exposure to particulate matter less than 10 microns in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) has been studies extensively. [10] A study done in US on the long-term effects of air pollution showing that each 10 micrograms/m3 elevation in PM10 accounted for 6% of increased risk of cardiopulmonary mortality. [11] Exposure to PM10 was also linked to asthma and bronchitis. Data from CNEPA showed that PM10 was the major pollutant for most monitoring areas. [7] We hypothesized that exposure to air pollutants, such as particulate matters (PM10), might influence the prognosis of SARS and lead to increased risk of deaths. This study was subject to several limitations. First, ecologic study designs were adopted in the study, which might be subject to ecologic fallacy. [12, 13] Furthermore, we couldn't predict the direction and magnitude of the bias because of no access of the data at the individual level. Second, we had no data on the joint distribution between air pollution and potential confounders such as socioeconomic status, smoking status, age, and gender; therefore, no confounding effects could be evaluated or controlled for. The uneven application of dangerous therapy and difference in medical facilities by region might also account for the variation of case fatality. But they might not fully explain the observed association because the same therapies were recommended by the Chinese Health Ministry and CDC and followed by medical practitioners in the country. Data showed that cases from Beijing had relatively higher case fatality, although this capital city might have provided better medical support to SARS patients. Third, we assumed that air pollution was evenly distributed within each region so that we could use monitoring data colleted within each region as individual's surrogate exposure to ambient air pollutants. Exposure misclassification might have biased the study results due to the imprecise measurements. Nevertheless, this is the first observation showing that air pollution is associated with increased fatality of SARS patients in Chinese population, which deserves further investigation and might have certain impact on the study of SARS nature history.",

Among 3,590 patients from regions with moderate APIs, 269 died from the disease. 17 out of 191 patients from regions with high APIs also died. The corresponding fatalities were 4.08%, 7.49% and 8.90%, respectively. SARS patients from regions with moderate APIs had an 84% increased risk of dying from SARS compared to those from regions with low APIs (RR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.41-2.40). Similarly, SARS patients from regions with high APIs were twice as likely to die from SARS compared to those from regions with low APIs. (RR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.31-3.65). The trend test showed that SARS case fatality increased with the increase of air pollution level (P for trend <0.001). (See",
