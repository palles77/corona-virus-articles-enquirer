In this study, we performed a systematic screening of a chemical library, followed by the antiviral evaluation of primary hits and their analogues. Eventually, a novel small-molecule compound PP7 that abrogated the PB1-PB2 association and impaired viral polymerase activity was identified. PP7 exhibited antiviral activities against influenza virus subtypes A (H1N1)pdm09, A(H7N9) and A(H9N2) in cell cultures and partially protected mice against lethal challenge of mouse-adapted influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Surprisingly, a panel of other subtypes of influenza virus, including A(H5N1) and A(H7N7), showed various degrees of resistance to the compound. Biochemical studies revealed a similar pattern of resistance on the impairment of polymerase activity. Molecular docking analyses suggested a PP7-binding site that appeared to be completely conserved among the subtypes of the virus mentioned above. Thus, we propose that alternative/additional binding site (s) may exist for the regulation of PB1-PB2 subunits assembly of influenza A virus.",

Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of influenza A virus (IAV) replication have hinted at new avenues for the development of antiviral agents that target viral proteins (Das et al., 2010) or host factors (Muller et al., 2012) . Generally, virus-targeting antivirals functionally inhibit the biological process of viral proteins, mostly enzymatic activities. Alternatively, they may block viral proteinprotein interactions (PPI) that are essential for the virus replication machinery (Lou et al., 2014) . Host-targeting antivirals inspect the host-virus battleground and focus on the cellular factors that are involved in the viral life cycle or host immune response. It is believed to be a more sophisticated strategy since they minimize the emergence of drug resistance (Watanabe and Kawaoka, 2015) . Nevertheless, the virus-targeting antivirals, such as polymerase and protease inhibitors, will still be the major choice in the development of antiviral therapies, probably due to our more comprehensive understanding of their underlying mechanisms (Lou et al., 2014) .",

Functioning as the viral RNA synthesis machine, the RdRp can produce either cRNA or vRNA through de novo replication or viral mRNA transcription through 'cap-snatching'. Functionally, PB1 houses the catalytic site for polymerase activity, while PB2 binds the cap structure of cellular pre-mRNA, which is cleaved by PA endonuclease and used as a primer for viral mRNA synthesis (Eisfeld et al., 2015) . Structurally, this heterotrimeric complex is assembled through the inter-subunit interfaces between the PA C-terminal domain (PA-Cter) and the PB1 N-terminal domain (PB1-Nter) (He et al., 2008; Obayashi et al., 2008) and between the PB1 C-terminal domain (PB1-Cter) and the PB2 N-terminal domain (PB2-Nter) (Sugiyama et al., 2009) . Undoubtedly, inhibition of the PA endonuclease (Yuan et al., 2016a) and PB2 cap-binding (Yuan et al., 2016c) are valid means in terms of the virus-targeting antivirals development. Another appealing strategy to inhibit RdRp function is to interfere with its proper assembly using PPI inhibitors. To this end, small molecule compounds targeting the PA-Cter and PB1-Nter interplay have been actively pursued since 2012 (Massari et al., 2016; Muratore et al., 2012; Yuan et al., 2016d) . Intriguingly, anti-influenza agents targeting the PB1-Cter and PB2-Nter interface have never been reported yet.",

We intended to identify compounds that were able to displace the binding of PB2-N peptide to PB1 protein, dissociate PB1-PB2 binding and thus decrease polymerase activity. To this end, an ELISA-based assay was modified to screen such kinds of compounds using His-tagged PB1-Cter protein as a receptor and biotinylated PB2-N peptide (PB2-N-Biotin, Suppl. Table 2 ) as a probe. Surprisingly, PB2-N-Biotin did not bind to PB1-Cter domain properly, exhibiting a narrow dynamic range and making the target protein unsuitable for drug screening (Suppl. Fig. 1 ). To address this issue, the full-length PB1 protein was applied. As shown in Fig. 2A , in the plate coated with full-length PB1, addition of increasing amounts of PB2-N-Biotin resulted in greater absorbance. When the concentration of PB1 protein and PB2-N-Biotin probe were maintained at 200 ng/well and 100 ng/ well respectively (molar ratio 1:10), the addition of PB2-N-Tat peptide, as a positive control, exhibited a dose-dependent reduction of absorbance (Fig. 2B) . Collectively, the results demonstrated a specific binding between PB1 protein and PB2-N-Biotin peptide and suggested that ELISA was able to provide a broad dynamic range for the screening of PB1-PB2 binding inhibitors. The result also suggested that the conformational structure of PB1 was critical for PB1-PB2 binding.",

We proceeded to carry out a doseresponse analysis to identify the compounds that consistently blocked the PB1 protein and probe binding. According to our result, five among 9 compounds were defined as 'active', with IC 50 < 5 mg/ ml (data not shown). Next, a cell-based plaque reduction assay was applied to identify the antiviral candidate(s) within the 5 'active' compounds. Only one compound, namely PP4, reduced the plaque number in a concentration-dependent manner and was regarded as an antiviral effective compound. Based on the structural properties of PP4, twelve structurally similar analogues with drug-like properties (Lipinski, 2004) were purchased and applied to structure-activity analyses (Suppl. Excel file). Initially, analogues were evaluated for their inhibitory effect against PB1-PB2 binding, followed by plaque assays to determine the antiviral potency. Our result showed that only PP7 exhibited inhibition against both PB1-PB2 binding and the virus replication. Structurally, two chlorine atoms on the benzene ring were essential to maintain such inhibitions (Suppl. Excel file). The selectivity index (SI), i.e. the ratio of 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC 50 ) to half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ), was determined to compare PP4 and PP7 (Fig. 3C) . Due to the considerably higher SI, we selected PP7 to further evaluate its antiviral activities in vitro and in vivo.",

To assess the antiviral effect of PP7 in vivo, mice challenged with either 10 MLD 50 (Fig. 4B ) or 3 MLD 50 (Fig. 4C ) of mouse-adapted A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were treated with PP7 or zanamivir as a positive control or PBS as a non-treated control. As shown in Fig. 4B , zanamivir-treated group showed 80% protection while survival rate in the PP7-treated group was 20% when mice were challenged with 10 MLD 50 of the virus. Upon lower challenge dose, 60% of mice that received intranasal treatment with PP7 survived, while all mice died in the PBS-treated group (Fig. 4C) . The survival rate in the zanamivir group was 100% (Fig. 4C) . The results showed a significant improvement of mouse survival with the treatment of PP7 (p < 0.01) or zanamivir (p < 0.001) ( Fig. 4B and C) . When mice were infected with 3 MLD 50 of challenge dose, the result demonstrated that PP7-treated group exhibited about a 10fold reduction in viral load (p < 0.05) in the lung tissues as compared with the PBS-treated control group (Fig. 4D) . Thus, we concluded that PP7 was able to provide some protection against the infection of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in vitro and mouseadapted A(H1N1)pdm09 in vivo.",

As shown in Fig. 5BeD , mRNA, cRNA and vRNA levels were quantified in infectious contexts and presented as the ratio between PP7treated and mock-treated samples. In the presence of PP7, significant decreases of mRNA syntheses were detected in A(H1N1) pdm09 (p < 0.0001), A(H7N9) (p \u00bc 0.0021) and A(H9N2) (p \u00bc 0.0038) virus-infected cells (Fig. 5B) , whereas no significant difference was observed in the cells infected with the A(H5N1) and A(H7N7) viruses (p > 0.05, Fig. 5B ).

The result showed that all of the 7 residues, except Val 715, were fully conserved in the 6 virus strains (asterisk marks, Fig. 6A ). However, V715M substitution was detected in both PP7-sensitive and insensitive virus strains, e.g. A(H9N2) and A(H5N1-HK), so that the contribution of this amino acid substitution to the strain-specific sensitivity to PP7 might be excluded. Next, some residue substitutions in the other positions, such as V728I, S741A, and M744L were found, while none of them serves as a marker to distinguish the PP7-sensitive or resistant strains. Subsequently, we performed molecular docking analyses to predict potential binding sites that PP7 bound to. Since PP7 was screened as a PB2-N binding competitor, the compound was docked with the PB1-Cter domain directly. As predicted in Fig. 6B and C, significant salt bridge formed through the contacts between the hydroxyl of PP7 and Ser 720, Arg 721, Ile 724 of PB1-Cter domain and between the ethoxyphenyl and Arg 723, Arg 727, while the two chlorine atoms of PP7 interacted with the amino acids Arg 707, Pro 708 and Val 709. Intriguingly, all of the above 8 residues were completely conserved among the 6 virus strains that we tested (green boxes, at 15-hour post-infection.

To verify this postulation experimentally, a competitive ELISA was utilized (Fig. 2) , which enabled the initial identification of anti-influenza effective compounds (Fig. 3) . Notably, one of the most effective compounds, PP7, was shown to provide protection against infection of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in vitro and mouse-adapted A(H1N1)pdm09 in vivo ( Fig. 4) . PP7 exhibited modest in vivo anti-influenza activity when compared with the commercial available drug zanamivir (Fig. 4BeD) , which was limited by its moderate bioavailability in vivo. On the other hand, it is worth noting that intranasal treatments, as we used in the study, may facilitate influenza virus infections and promote lung pathology (Smee et al., 2012) . Apparently, drug delivery through intranasal route is direct and efficient. However, intranasal liquid also helps to spread the virus inside the mouse lungs (Taylor, 1941) . Therefore, the treatment of influenza virus infections by the intranasal route requires additional optimization of virus challenge dose to avoid compromising the effectiveness of a potentially useful antiviral agent.",

            "text": "PP7 is a novel and artificially synthesized compound, whose biological testing results have never been mentioned before. However, it was surprising that the inhibition of virus replication by PP7 was strain/subtype-specific even though the drug target is highly conserved among various subtypes (Fig. 5A) . The observation was in agreement with that reported by Reuther et al., where they concluded the different assembly strategies of influenza polymerase utilizing PB2 1-37 -GFP fusion protein to target the PB1-PB2 interface (Reuther et al., 2011) . To investigate the reasons for differential inhibition, we examined the sensitivity of IAV RdRp to PP7 and found that polymerase activity in PP7-resistant virus strains was less impaired (Fig. 5BeD) . The RdRp of influenza A virus serves as the hub for viral transcription and replication . Traditionally, influenza polymerase activity is evaluated through Fig. 6 . Sequence alignment and molecular docking analyses. (A) Sequence alignment of the PB1 C-terminal fragments (residues 678e757) from the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H5N1), A(H7N7), A(H7N9) and A(H9N2) virus strains are shown. Residues in red are identical between the 6 virus strains, while substitutions are in blue or purple. The predicted PP7 binding sites are highlighted with green boxes and shown to be completely conserved. The interface residues between PB1-Cter and PB2-Nter, as concluded from a previous crystal structure, are labeled with an asterisk. The alignment was done by Vector NTI (Life Technologies). (B) Two-dimensional docking analysis and (C) ribbon diagram of the interaction between PP7 and PB1-Cter are shown. Two chlorine atoms of PP7 contact with the amino acids Arg 707, Pro 708 and Val 709, while the remaining chemical groups interact with PB1-Cter through the residues Ser 720, Arg 721, Arg 723, Ile 724, and Arg 727. In the 3D structural analysis, chemical structure is shown as a stick model, whereas interacting amino acid residues are labeled in black. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) mini-replicon assays (Fig. 1A) . However, the cloning work becomes tedious in a scenario of measuring polymerase activities of several virus strains. To find an alternative, an RT-qPCR method was utilized (Fig. 5BeD) . To determine the specificity of such assay, minireplicon assays based on A(H1N1)pdm09 and H7N7 viral genes were carried out. As shown in Suppl. Fig. 3 , polymerase activity in A(H1N1)pdm09 exhibited a dose-dependent and greater sensitivity to PP7 inhibition than that of the H7N7 group, which validated the role of RT-qPCR method as an alternative to mini-replicon assays. Importantly, the assay was able to quantify the mRNA, cRNA and vRNA synthesis activities across different virus subtypes of IAV. It took into account the context of an infectious event instead of the recombinant enzyme complex, thus may better recapitulate key physiological aspects of the polymerase activity.",

            "text": "To elucidate the discrepant observation between different influenza subtypes, first we speculated that structural variations between different PB1-Cter domains might play a role. Thus, sequence alignments focusing on the PB1-PB2 interactive residues as well as the predicted PP7-binding sites were carried out (Fig. 6A) . Furthermore, docking simulation based on either the isolated PB1-PB2 complex ( Fig. 6B and C) or the whole architecture of influenza A polymerase heterotrimer (Suppl. Fig. 5 ) were carried out. The result suggested that PP7 interacted with similar but not fully identical residues, whose difference might be due to (i) the structures of batspecific influenza A polymerase differ from that of human/avian A strains ; (ii) PB1-PB2 conformation changes after the assembly of polymerase heterotrimer (Deng et al., 2005) . However, our analyses suggested that none of the mentioned residues could account for the various degrees of sensitivity. Furthermore, PB2-N-Tat, which was shown to be anti-H1N1 effective (Fig. 1B) , exerted similar specificity of antiviral efficacy as PP7 (Suppl. Fig. 2 ). To investigate whether substitution (s) in PB2-Nter could cause differences in susceptibility to PP7, an alignment of the tested viruses was carried out. The only one substitution at position 9, i.e. PB2 D9N/Y, was identified (Suppl. Fig. 4) . However, its role in the strain-specific inhibition of IAV has been excluded in a previous report (Reuther et al., 2011) . Taken together, it was speculated that either the molecular docking did not essentially identify the PP7 binding site, which was limited by the solely available but un-identical PB1 structures for docking simulation. Alternatively, additional binding locations beyond the one investigated in this study might exist to mediate the PB1-PB2 association even though theoretically PP7 binds to the conserved region across different subtypes. Consequently, the alternative PB1-PB2 interaction site(s) would be able to sustain the assembly of the polymerase complex of A(H5N1)-VN, A(H5N1)-HK, and A(H7N7), even when the contact between PB1-Cter and PB2-Nter was functionally blocked.",

To verify if this is where the alternative binding site locates, we detected the interaction between PB1 subunit and PB2-Cter domain by using coimmunoprecipitation analysis and ELISA as tools. However, the results showed that the PB2-Cter failed to associate with the fulllength PB1 in both experiments (data not shown), suggesting that the supposed PB1-PB2 binding site does not locate in this region. Another hypothesis proposed that the N-terminal domain of PA protein (PA-Nter) acted as a molecular mediator between the PB1-PB2 interplay, which is caused by the fact that it is PA-PB1 dimer, instead of the PB1 monomer, contacts with PB2 (Deng et al., 2005; Reuther et al., 2011) . Thus, it is possible that conformational changes of PB1 are induced upon PA-PB1 binding. Consequently, in our case, the PA-PB1 dimer of A(H7N7) and A(H5N1) influenza virus might shield the binding site of PP7 by contacting PB2 through an alternative manner. To verify this, however, in-depth analyses to identify the decisive amino acid(s) in PA-Nter that distinguish PP7resistant and sensitive virus strains shall be carried out in future studies.",

(A) Virus copies in the supernatant were quantified, as a reflection of the antiviral effects of PP7 against infections of influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H5N1), A(H7N7), A(H7N9) and A(H9N2). MDCK cells were infected with different strains/subtypes of IAV at MOI of 0.002 and treated with serialdiluted PP7 as indicated. Viral copies in the supernatant were determined at 24 h post-infection using RT-qPCR assay. The experiments were carried out in triplicate and repeated twice. Data are represented as mean values \u00fe SD. Differences between various concentrations treatments were compared and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. * indicates p < 0.05 as compared to mock-treated group. (B, C, D) Bar charts show the level of viral mRNA (B), cRNA (C), and vRNA (D) synthesis by different influenza virus polymerases, in the presence of PP7 treatment. MDCK cells were infected with indicated IAV at MOI of 0.1. After virus entry, cells were maintained with or without 40 mM of PP7, followed by total RNA extraction",
