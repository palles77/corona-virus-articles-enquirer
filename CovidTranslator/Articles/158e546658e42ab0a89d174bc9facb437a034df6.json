By the end of January 2020, city-wide lockdowns were implemented for Wuhan and neighbouring cities. Nonetheless, the virus has managed to spread from Wuhan to other Chinese cities and also outside of China.

Data on imported cases aggregated by destination were obtained from the WHO technical report dated 4th February 2020 2 (a zero case count was assumed for all locations not listed). We used case counts up to the 4th February, because after this date the number of exported cases from Hubei drops rapidly 2 , likely due to the Hubei-wide lockdowns. We defined imported cases as those with known travel history from China (of those, 83% had travel history from Hubei province, and 17% from unknown locations in China 2 ). We excluded cases that are likely due to transmission outside of China or whose transmission source is still under investigation 2 .

Our model can be adjusted to account for exportation of cases from locations other than Wuhan as the outbreak develops and more information on importations and self-sustained transmission becomes available. One key advantage of this model is that it does not rely on estimates of incidence or prevalence in the epicentre of the outbreak. Based on our model, locations whose case counts exceed the 95% prediction interval (PI) could be interpreted as having higher case-detection capacity and/or more connection with Wuhan than that captured by available daily air travel volume, such as land transportation. Locations below the 95% PI may have undetected cases based on the expected case count under high surveillance. We recommend that outbreak surveillance and control efforts for potential local transmission should be rapidly strengthened in those locations lying below the 95% PI lower bound, in particular Indonesia, to ensure detection of cases and appropriate control measures to reduce the risk of self-sustained transmission.",

In summary, of 195 worldwide locations (in general, locations reflect countries without any position on territorial claims) our model considers N=191 due to the exclusion of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Data on daily air travel volume was obtained as follows. Lai et al. 4 report monthly air travel volume estimates for the 27 locations most connected to Wuhan outside mainland China. These estimates are based on historical (February 2018) data from the International Air Travel Association 4 . They include direct and indirect flight itineraries from Wuhan to destinations outside of China. For all 164 locations not listed by Lai et al. 4 , we set the daily air travel volume to 1.5 passengers per day, which is one half of the minimum reported by Lai et al. Surveillance capacity was assessed using the Global Health Security Index, which is an assessment of health security including detection and reporting capabilities across 195 countries agreeing to the International Health Regulations (IHR [2005]) 3 .",

First, we generated a bootstrapped dataset by sampling n locations with replacement among high surveillance locations. Second, we re-estimated \u03b2 using the bootstrapped dataset. Third we simulated case counts for all N =191 locations under our model using the estimate of \u03b2 based on the bootstrapped dataset. These three steps were repeated 50,000 times to generate for each of the N locations 50,000 simulated case counts from which the lower and upper PI bounds (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles) were computed. In Figure 1 the 95% PI bounds were smoothed using functions from the R package ggplot2 6 . The reported case counts of all n =49 high surveillance locations (22 with non-zero case counts plus 27 with zero case counts) used to fit the model (Figure 1, purple-coloured points) are plotted alongside those for all 142 locations that do not have high surveillance (Figure 1, blue-coloured points).To assess the robustness of our results we reran the analysis as described above, but each time implementing one of the following changes: 1) setting the daily air travel volume for locations not listed by Lai et al. to 0.1, 1, or 3 (instead of 1.5) passengers per day; 2) defining high surveillance locations using a more lenient and a more stringent GHS index (50th and 95th quantile respectively instead of 75th); 3)",
