            "text": "The social and economic costs associated with medical errors are staggering. 1 Reducing accidents and errors is a major focus of hospital quality programs and an international policy imperative. 2 Engaging patients is increasingly recognized to be an important component of safety initiatives [3] [4] [5] and a logical extension of efforts to involve patients in the health care process. 6 Patients are present at the point of care where errors may occur, able to detect medically relevant incidents, 7 concerned about their safety, [8] [9] [10] and correspondence: charles e cunningham ron Joyce children's health centre, child and Youth Mental health Program, 237 Barton street east, hamilton, On l8l 2X2, canada Tel +1 905 521 2100 ext 77307 Fax +1 905 577 8453 email cunnic@hhsc.ca motivated to improve the quality of the care they receive. 11 Patients have been encouraged to reduce hospital-acquired infections by cleaning their hands and reminding service providers to observe hand hygiene protocols. 12 They have been asked to contribute to the prevention of diagnostic errors, 13 check medications, 14, 15 join safety committees, 6, 16 voice their safety concerns, 17 and notify health care workers if errors are detected. 18 The likelihood of engaging patients in safety partnerships varies as a function of the demographics of both patients and their service providers. Younger patients with higher levels of education, greater health literacy, and more accurate information about potential risks prefer a more active role in the delivery of safe care. 8 Engagement in safety initiatives also varies with the professional background of the health service providers with whom patients must partner. Patients, for example, are much more likely to direct questions regarding hand hygiene to nursing staff than to physicians. 12 Davis et al 12 reported that, across three studies, 90%-100% of participants questioned nurses about hand hygiene, whereas only 32%-40% asked physicians.",

Although many patients believe that they can contribute to safer hospital care, 19 their willingness to participate in safety initiatives varies as a function of their risk perceptions, 3 exposure to medical errors, 3 and beliefs regarding their role in safety. 12, 20 Cognitive models, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior, predict that the intent to participate would reflect expectations regarding the effectiveness of risk reduction strategies, encouragement by significant individuals, and confidence in one's ability to contribute to prevention. 11, 12 The type of safety partnership patients are asked to participate in exerts a strong influence on their engagement. 11, 19 Discharged inpatients would be more comfortable questioning nurses and doctors about medications than asking whether they had cleaned their hands. 6 Indeed, while 75.2% reported that they had inquired about medications, only 4.6% asked whether staff had cleaned their hands. 6 Patients are reluctant to make comments that might be perceived to challenge the authority or competence of service providers. 8, 21 They are concerned that health service providers may respond negatively, 11 patients may be labeled as difficult, 3 their relationship with service providers may be compromised, and the quality of the care they receive may be affected. 17 Studies of the attitudes of professionals provide some support for these concerns. 22 Efforts to engage patients in safety initiatives have included badges encouraging patients to ask whether health care providers cleaned their hands, 12 posters depicting the correct administration of key health care strategies, 23 or personal requests from health care professionals. 12 In one study, patients felt that they would be more than twice as likely to ask whether nurses or physicians had cleaned their hands if health care workers provided an invitation. 24 Although the best strategy seems to be a personal invitation from health care providers, 12 relative preference for, and effectiveness of, different engagement strategies is not well understood. This issue is one focus of the current study.",

DCEs make a methodological contribution to safety research by engaging the multistage decision strategies likely to influence the intent to participate in real-world safety initiatives, 29 reducing the influence of social desirability biases, 30 and improving the estimates of the relative value of the individual components of complex safety initiatives. 31 We explored four general research questions (RQs) and examined six more specific hypotheses (HYPs). 12 we examined relative preferences for partnerships that might include medication and identity double checks or membership on hospital safety committees. Previous studies suggest that, while patients respond positively to safety partnerships focusing on strategies to ensure the accuracy of medication administration, 6 they are uncomfortable in addressing staff compliance with hand hygiene protocols. 6 We predicted, therefore, that: HYP 1. Patients would show a stronger preference for partnerships involving medication double checks than for those asking staff to clean their hands.",

If they agreed, a research team member explained the study, obtained electronic consent, and administered the survey on a laptop computer. Of 1,883 approached, 1,609 (85.4%) agreed to consider participation.

Recordings were transcribed and summarized thematically. Next, we identified widely disseminated safety partnerships and attributes of the implementation process that might influence patient decisions (eg, safety partnership decision making or training). Using a consensual process, we narrowed this information to 15 safety partnership attributes. Attributes ranged from the point of care (eg, medication and identity double checks) to policy and governance (safety committee membership). 26 Each attribute included four levels 42 selected to combine logically with the levels of other attributes. 31, 41 We included a level depicting the absence of most attributes. 31 experimental design and procedure",

This is consistent with studies suggesting that patients rate double checks, and related approaches to the prevention of medication errors, very positively. 19, 21 Hand hygiene campaigns, in contrast, exerted a limited influence on safety partnership choices. Consistent with HYP 2, participants were more likely to choose partnerships prompting patients to wash their hands than those encouraging patients to remind staff to wash their hands. This finding is consistent with research suggesting that patients consider asking staff whether they have cleaned their hands to be less effective than other strategies and themselves to be less likely to participate in these programs than in other risk reduction initiatives. 21, 53 Waterman et al 19 reported that only 5% of 2,078 post-discharge inpatients asked nurses or doctors whether they had cleaned their hands. This is consistent with evidence that patients are reluctant to engage in partnerships that might be perceived to challenge the competence of service providers. 8 rQ 2: Are there segments with different safety partnership preferences? Consistent with HYP 3, latent class analysis revealed two segments that might be expected to respond to different safety partnerships. Younger outpatients with higher education were more likely to be members of an actively engaged segment that valued scientific evidence that patients could improve safety. As HYP 4 postulated, they anticipated more benefits to safety partnerships and expressed more confidence in their ability to contribute. As the Theory of Planned Behavior predicts, they were more intent on participating. 11 They showed a stronger interest in multifaceted approaches to safety education, preferred personal reminders, and advocated complete disclosure of errors. In previous studies, patients with higher activation scores engage in more preventive activities, are more likely to follow treatment protocols, evidence better health outcomes, incur fewer costs, and evaluate care experiences more positively. 32 Passively engaged participants anticipated fewer benefits to safety partnerships, were less confident in their ability to contribute, and less intent on participating. They preferred that staff give a rationale for safety partnerships and decide whether patients were informed of errors. In comparison to the actively engaged segment, patient representation on safety committees was more important to the passively engaged segment. Passively engaged participants, who may be less comfortable expressing their concerns, may value patient representatives who can speak on their behalf. Participants with immigrant backgrounds, less education, and receiving services as inpatients were more likely to be members of the passively engaged segment. These findings are consistent with studies linking limited education and lower levels of health literacy 54 to a preference for a less active role in health 32,36 and safety. 3, 8, 19, 55 The Theory of Planned Behavior predicts that enhancing self-efficacy should increase the intent to participate. 11 Although utility values showed that actively engaged participants preferred to read how to make care safer, they also responded positively to a more comprehensive multimodal approach to safety education utilizing readings, videos, and checklists. Passively engaged participants, in contrast, preferred to simply read about safety strategies. However, when the medication and identity double-checks participants valued were included in a multicomponent (readings, videos, and checklists) educational strategy, simulations predicted that 91% of the passively engaged segment would choose an approach including this active learning option. The results of simulations reveal attitudinal processes via which highly valued attributes Consistent with HYP 5, simulations predicted that, rather than delegating responsibility for safety to hospital staff, 97.6% of our study participants would prefer partnerships between staff and patients. The strength of this finding is consistent with a study reporting that 91% of a sample of discharged inpatients agreed that patients could contribute to the prevention of health service errors. 19 rQ 4: What type of engagement strategy do patients prefer?",

            "text": "HYP 6 postulated that patients would prefer a personal engagement strategy rather than visual safety prompts. Simulations predicted that 57.5% of the study participants would prefer a personal strategy in which staff engaged patients in safety partnerships. This is consistent with evidence that encouragement by doctors and nurses may increase participation. 12 In contrast, 42.4% would prefer an approach with signage reminding patients to ask about safety, report safety concerns, and wash their hands. Preference for a visual communication strategy was strongest in the passively engaged segment. We were surprised by the number of participants predicted to choose a visual strategy. There may be several explanations for this finding. Patients, for example, may perceive signs to be less of a burden to staff than a personal discussion. 3 In a sample of 277 health care workers, 26% felt there was insufficient time to encourage patients to ask about hand washing. 22 Signs may also put less pressure on those who find safety partnerships inconsistent with their perception of the patient's role. In addition to their alignment with the preferences of a significant number of participants, the signage and visual prompts included in a range of health, safety, and infection control initiatives 56, 57 can simultaneously inform patients, family members, staff, and the administrators who are critical to the success of large-scale safety initiatives. 39, 58 Signs can be prepared in multiple languages, use an array of interactive strategies, allow patients to review safety recommendations, and facilitate the positioning of reminders at key points along the health service pathway. 59 Despite these advantages, effective signage requires careful attention to visual appeal, content, health literacy, and culture; 39,60,61 evidence regarding its unique contribution to hospital safety is lacking. 39 Although decision-making processes exerted less influence than many other partnership design attributes, both segments preferred an approach to safety based on shared decisions. Neither segment chose to delegate safety decisions to staff, nor to make these decisions independently. Systematic reviews show that patients are more likely to adhere to health services that are consistent with their preferences. 62, 63 Collaborative decisions, therefore, are more likely to promote the engagement that enhances the patient experience and improves outcome. 32 Informed decisions require an awareness of the risks safety partnerships might reduce. Risk information exerted an important influence on partnership choices. Both segments preferred that all patients were informed about risks to safety. Awareness of risks is associated with greater confidence in one's ability to prevent medical errors. 21 Confidence in one's ability to prevent medical errors (self-efficacy), in turn, predicts the intent to act preventively. 21 Both segments preferred that patients report safety concerns directly to staff and that those conveying safety concerns were thanked and told how the hospital will respond. Although both segments preferred that patients decide whether to give their names when reporting safety concerns, variations in the anonymity afforded those reporting safety concerns exerted relatively little influence on choices.",
