Among the AIE dyes, tetraphenylethylene (TPE) is synthesized by simple reactions and emits very efficiently in aggregated or crystal states. The water-soluble cationic TPE derivatives can be used as bioprobes for detection of proteins, DNA, and RNA [4] . The TPE compounds bearing adenine and thymine moieties can be used as chemosensors for Ag + and Hg 2+ , respectively [5] .

The chemical structures and molecular masses of compounds 1 and 2 were confirmed from their NMR and mass spectra. Lactosyl and 6 0 -sialyllactosyl moieties were introduced into compound 2 by click chemistry between the propargyl group of TPE derivative and the azide group of aglycon of oligosaccharide compounds (12-azidododecyl b-lactoside and 12-azidododecyl 6 0 -sialyllactoside) using CuSO 4 and sodium ascorbate as shown in Scheme 1B. 12-Azidododecyl b-6 0 -sialyllactoside was obtained by enzymatic reaction from 12-azidododecyl b-lactoside using ST6 in 70% yield. Because the solubility of TPE derivative and12-azidododecyl b-lactoside to water was low, they were dissolved in DMSO and added to the reaction solution. TLC analysis (chloroform-methanol-H 2 O, 5:4:1) of these mixtures showed no sign of the starting compound 2. Analysis of the MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of Lac-TPE and a2,6SL-TPE revealed a peak at m/z 2777.6 ([M+Na] + ) and 4030.9 ([M-4H+5Na] + ), respectively.",

Because the ligation reaction proceeded with CuSO 4 /ascorbate in water/DMSO mixtures at room temperature, water-soluble compounds such as oligosaccharide could be easily ligated to TPE derivatives. By this technique, we prepared fluorescence oligosaccharide probes and demonstrated that a2,6SL-TPE can be used as fluorescent sensor for influenza virus. ",

The emission of less than 400 nm light depends on the self-luminosity of the 96-well microtiter plate. However, after addition of influenza virus A/WSN/33, the emission band at 460 nm increased. Actually, the difference of fluorescence between the absence and presence of influenza virus can be distinguished by the naked eye under UV illumination as shown in Fig. 2. Moreover, we examined detectable amounts of influenza virus. The fluorescence intensity of a2,6SL-TPE at 460 nm increased significantly as a function of increasing amounts of influenza virus as shown in",
