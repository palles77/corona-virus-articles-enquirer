The number of persons entering and leaving China has been steadily increasing, from 302 million person-times in 2005 to 570 million person-times in 2016, and the number of visitor arrivals in Yunnan Province has increased from 1. Some infectious diseases have been reemerging, such as epidemic hemorrhagic fever and malaria, which previously had basically been controlled, and wild poliovirus, which had been eliminated in China in 2000. After >10 years without a case of wild poliovirus infection in China, an outbreak of wild poliovirus infection occurred in 2011 in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (2) . A few emerging infectious diseases, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), yellow fever, and Zika virus disease, have also been imported into China.",

Malaria is a mosquitoborne infectious disease that caused a heavy health and economic burden in the past. Anopheles sinensis, An. lesteri, An. minimus, and An. dirus mosquitoes are considered to be 4 major malaria vectors in China. As a main vector of transmitting malaria, An. sinensis mosquitoes are present in all provinces and regions except Qinghai and Xinjiang; An. lesteri mosquitoes are found in areas south of 34\u00b0N latitude, An. minimus mosquitoes in mountainous and hilly areas south of 33\u00b0N latitude, and An. dirus mosquitoes mainly in the tropical jungles of Hainan. In China, Aedes albopictus and Ae. aegypti mosquitoes are 2 major vectors that can transmit flaviviruses and alphaviruses, which cause diseases such as dengue fever, chikungunya, and yellow fever. According to a recent investigation by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Ae. aegypti mosquitoes are found in 10 cities or counties in Yunnan Province, 7 cities or counties in Hainan Province, 1 city in Guangdong Province, and areas south of the Tropic of Cancer in Taiwan. Ae. albopictus mosquitoes are widely present in 25 provinces in China, in the southeastern parts of a line between Shenyang in Liaoning Province and Motuo County in Tibet (7, 8) .",

Once a case of notifiable infectious disease or emerging infectious disease is identified, it is mandatory for doctors in all hospitals and clinics to report to the network within the statutory period. CDCs at various levels (e.g., provincial) are in charge of data checking, utilization, and timely information feedback by uploading the reports on the websites. All the hospitals and CDCs at different levels can download these reports and know the national status in a timely manner, which makes the epidemic information transparent.

Imported P. falciparum malaria is a major obstacle to achieving malaria elimination in China (12) (13) (14) . This study showed that malaria was the most frequent imported infectious disease during 2005-2016, and Yunnan was the province with the greatest number of cases of imported malaria, which was consistent with other relevant studies in China (15) (16) (17) . The reason for the large number of imported cases is that Yunnan Province has long international borders with Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, and other countries of the Greater Mekong Subregion that show a high incidence of malaria (16) . The persons who cross these borders to enter or leave China increase opportunities for infectious diseases to be imported from adjacent countries (3, 14, 18, 19) , especially from Myanmar (12, 13, 20) . P. falciparum malaria was imported mainly from Ghana and P. vivax malaria mainly from Asia, which was consistent with Zhou's findings (5) . The number of cases of P. falciparum malaria imported into Guangxi Province increased significantly in 2013; this increase can be attributed mainly to cases imported from Ghana in 2013, which was related to people working in Ghana and other Africa countries during a gold rush in that year (21, 22) .",

First, as a result of the rapid development of international economic exchange, trade, and travel, the number of migrant workers from China in Africa and Asia has increased annually in recent years. Second, climate and sanitary conditions in Africa and Southeast Asia are suitable for mosquitoes. Migrant workers from China in these areas are engaged mostly in outdoor field work, and their working and living environments are not mosquito preventive. Therefore, they have greater risk for infection (24, 25) . In addition, their health education level and self-protection awareness are low. All these factors have resulted in an increased number of malaria and other mosquitoborne diseases (26) . Therefore, the main challenges of eliminating P. falciparum malaria are curtailing border malaria and imported cases from Myanmar and countries in Africa (6, 14) . Cooperation between China and neighboring countries has played an important role in improving malaria control at cross-border areas and should be further strengthened.",

However, the numbers and the types of imported infectious diseases reported have increased in recent years. We indicate 4 main reasons for this increase. First, globalization is a major factor. With growing economic globalization, ongoing development of Emerging Infectious Diseases \u2022 www.cdc.gov/eid \u2022 Vol. 25, No. 1, January 2019 international trade, and convenient and fast transportation in recent years, factors such as microbial mutation, global warming, floods, droughts, and natural migration of animals as disease vectors have increased the risk of disease introduction into China (27) (28) (29) . Second, these increases are related to the increases in the number of migrant workers from China, as well as increases in the number of tourists. This study showed that migrant workers from China accounted for a large proportion of imported malaria. Migrant workers and tourists are more at risk than local residents because of lack of preexisting immunity that dramatically increases the chances that they could become infected with these diseases and bring them in from abroad (19) . Third, the level of surveillance, diagnosis, and detection of emerging or reemerging infectious diseases improved in China during the study years, which potentially contributed to the increase in the number and the types of cases with a confirmed diagnosis. Finally, some of the increases were caused by newly discovered or emerging infections, such as MERS, which was discovered in 2012 and confirmed in 2013; the 1 case imported into China was a result of the large outbreak in South Korea in 2015.",

The imported cases that were analyzed in this study were reported through the National Information Reporting System of Infectious Diseases and identified by local CDC staff through epidemiologic investigation; therefore, not all imported cases may have been identified. A second limitation is that the data of this study were obtained from the monitoring system and there are few denominator data to use for calculating the rates of imported infectious diseases, so conclusions are limited and risks cannot be calculated. Finally, the factors concerning imported infectious diseases are complex, whereas our data are limited. Some demographic characteristics; trip information, such as purpose and duration of travel; and climate, environmental, and other relevant information could not be obtained. In subsequent research, we will focus on the collection of more information and continue to conduct our in-depth study of imported infectious diseases.",

The effectiveness of border screening is controversial (31), but in recent years, China's screening practices have proven to be a crucial measure for discovering imported infectious diseases in travelers who are ill at the time they cross a border. Screening has played a major role in prevention as the first line of defense against importation of foreign infectious diseases. For example, among 25 (11) , and of 11 cases of imported yellow fever reported in 2016, border screening recognized 6 (32). Border screening should be strengthened and improved to prevent those epidemic diseases and others from entering China (32) (33) (34) . Third, as a second line of defense against imported diseases, fever clinics and primary clinicians need to play an active role in identifying patients with imported infectious diseases. At present, many problems exist in fever clinics set up in medical institutions, such as failure to meet requirements, unqualified procedures, or nonstandardized management, and some locations may even be out of service. Clearer management standards are needed to provide a better chance for infectious disease screening. Training of medical staff, especially primary clinicians, should be reinforced to improve the ability to identify, diagnose, and treat emerging or reemerging infectious diseases and to ensure that imported cases can be diagnosed and control measures can be implemented as early as possible to prevent these diseases from further spreading in China.",
