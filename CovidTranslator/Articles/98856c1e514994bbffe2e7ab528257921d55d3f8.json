The first person-to-person transmission in Italy was reported on February 21, 2020, and led to an infection chain that represents the largest outbreak outside Asia to date [2] . As of March 12, 2020, in Italy, there are 10,590 positive patients, 827 deaths, and 1,045 healed, with numbers varying from hour to hour. The COVID-19 ncubation interval varies from 5 to 14 days [3] . Since January 30, 2020, WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, and the day after the Italian Government declared a public health emergency. In the first phase, the Government defined areas at different risk of infection: a) high-risk (so-called \"red zone or level 1 risk zone\" b) mean risk (level 2 risk zone) and c) the rest of national territory, to be alerted but considered at low risk (level 3 risk zone). In the subsequent phases of the crisis, following the indications of a scientific and technical committee and in agreement with the WHO, the Government finally decided to extend the Red Zone to the whole Nation (March 8, 2020). All public Hospitals faced an unprecedented emergency, with drastic changes in the organization. All cancer patients were consequently involved at different levels. We here report the experience of a group of Northern Italy Radiotherapy Departments that are located inside or very close to the first \"Red Zone,\" and thus were the first to face the emergency. accessing the radiotherapy areas.",

As the first affected regions are characterized by a very high population density, the virus dramatically spread in a few weeks throughout Northern Italy. As a consequence, all cancer patients' therapeutic flows were altered: surgery, systemic therapies, and radiotherapy. The radiotherapy centers located in the hospitals that were the first to face the emergency gained rapid field experience and then started monitoring the situation and collecting data. This report presents a few practical suggestions that came up from the first two weeks of collective work under emergency conditions and is the result of a joint effort to ensure continuity of therapies while protecting patients, health professionals, and the general population. The indications were integrated with the WHO recommendations and with the local health authorities' guidelines. The primary aim was to share information and provide guidance to radiotherapy departments worldwide. The report is mainly focused on how to deal with symptomatic, suspect, or COVID-19 positive patients undergoing radiation therapy. Since international indications for radiotherapy units facing COVID-19 outbreak have not been developed yet, we identified five key priorities, here described, together with a brief analysis of the problems and the possible solutions.",

PRIORITY 1: TO ENSURE RADIATION THERAPY DELIVERY TO CANCER PATIENTS Problem analysis: Radiotherapy is a \"life-saving\" treatment and should be guaranteed to all cancer patients in which is indicated [4]. Suggested solutions: Regional and hospital management must ensure the full functioning of Italian radiotherapy facilities, even in emergency conditions. PRIORITY 2: TO ENSURE SAFETY OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, PATIENTS, AND CAREGIVERS Problem analysis: A widespread infection of the staff working in a radiotherapy facility would effectively result in the closure of part of the activities. Failure to identify the suspect or infected patients would increase the risk of spreading to operators and patients undergoing treatment. Suggested solutions:1.If a triage point at the entrance to the hospital has not been activated, the indication is to carry out a triage at the access of the radiotherapy department, to verify possible contacts with COVID-19 positive patients and evaluate suspect symptoms in all others (patients, caregivers)",
