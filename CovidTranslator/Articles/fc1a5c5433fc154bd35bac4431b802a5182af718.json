Thus, the dosage forms of drugs for the treatment and prevention of influenza can be developed on the basis of the betulonic acid ketoxime [1, 2] . Acylation of the oximes of betulonic acid, its methyl ester, 20 oxoallobetulone, and ursolic acid by acetic, succinic, and phthalic anhydrides weakens the antiviral activity of the parent compounds [3] [4] [5] [6] . Reduction of the oxime of ursolic acid to the 3 deoxy 3 amino derivative produces in the latter cytotoxicity against HL 60, Bel 7402, and Hela cells. It was also found that the 3\u03b2 amino isomer is 20 times more active than the 3\u03b1 isomer [7, 8] . The products of Beckmann rearrangements of betulonic acid oxime exhibit antibacterial activity against Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus at concentrations 25-50 mg/ml [9] . Derivatives of oleanolic acid can be used in cosmetology, because they transport biologi cally active compounds deep into tissue and make them more potent [10] . A seconitrile lupeol exhibits antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum at MIC > 50 mg/ml [11] .",

Cyanoethylation of oxime (I) by acrylonitrile led to a 2 cyanoethoxy imine (II) with 83% yield (scheme).

Its structure was confirmed by the signals of two CN groups at \u03b4 113.3 and 114.3 ppm, as well as signals of C3, at \u03b4 174.1 ppm in the spectrum of 13 C NMR. Because the amino group in amidoxime is electron deficient and therefore less reactive than the hydroxyl, cyanoethylation of only the hydroxyl group is most likely [18] , but in the case of compound (IV) reaction was at the hydroxyl and amino groups at the same time. 3 The available oxime of methyl betulonate deriva tive, having the structure of a nitrile group, is 2 cyano 3,4 secolupa 20(29) ene 28 oic acid methyl ester (VI). Previously, this was used for the synthesis of acid [19] , amide, and amine [11] , 4,20 diketone [20] . In this paper, we engaged the nitrile compound (VI) in the synthesis of amidoxime (VII) and 3 amino 3,4 secobetulin (VIII). Cyanoethylation of compound (VIII) by acrylonitrile proceeded to the hydroxyl and amino groups to formation of O,N di (2 cyanoethyl) derivative (IX). Judging from the spectral data, the substitution of one hydrogen atom occurred in the amino group. Displacement of the signal of the C28 atom in the spectrum of the 13 C NMR compound (IX) reaches ~2 ppm compared with the spectrum of deriv ative (VIII) (shown at \u03b4 69.7 ppm).
