These techniques have had a rapid but unconventional route of development during the last 30 years, with the discovery and introduction of several assays in clinical diagnosis. The increase in the number of commercially available methods has facilitated the use of this technology in the majority of laboratories worldwide. This technology has reduced the use of some other techniques such as viral culture based methods and serological assays in the clinical virology laboratory. Moreover, nucleic acid amplification techniques are now the methods of reference and also the most useful assays for the diagnosis in several diseases. The introduction of these techniques and their automation provides new opportunities for the clinical laboratory to affect patient care. The main objectives in performing nucleic acid tests in this field are to provide timely results useful for high-quality patient care at a reasonable cost, because rapid results are associated with improvements in patients care. The use of amplification techniques such as polymerase chain reaction, real-time polymerase chain reaction or nucleic acid sequence-based amplification for virus detection, genotyping and quantification have some advantages like high sensitivity and reproducibility, as well as a broad dynamic range. This review is an up-to-date of the main nucleic acid techniques and their clinical applications, and special challenges and opportunities that these techniques currently provide for the clinical virology laboratory.",

            "text": "Molecular diagnostic techniques for viral testing have experimented a rapid development during the last years [1] , and have been introduced in the majority of laboratories as a new way for the diagnosis of human pathogens like viruses. This field of molecular microbiology presents many challenges to the practice of laboratory medicine, above all the implementation like automated methodology. The introduction of fully automated devices with faster turnaround times has allowed clinical laboratories the necessary tools to report sensitive and accurate results to physicians. The goals in performing microbiology nucleic acid tests (NAT) are mainly to provide timely results useful for high-quality patient care at a reasonable cost. Rapid results obtained by NAT are associated with improvements in patient care. Empiric data and modeling studies find that faster detection of enteroviral meningitis using NAT is associated with reduced length of stay and duration of antibiotic administration, as well as substantial cost savings [2] . The use of amplification techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR or nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) [3] for virus detection, genotyping and quantification have some advantages like high sensitivity and reproducibility, as well as a broad dynamic range [4, 5] . A great number of qualitative and quantitative molecular virus assays, mostly *Address correspondence to this author at the Microbiology Unit (Biotechnology Area), Hospital de Poniente.

NASBA assays could identify active infection by detecting viral messenger RNA (mRNA) but the most widely used tests in clinical virus diagnosis are quantitative real-time PCR techniques [8] . Many molecular diagnostic methods have been replaced by automated devices that use less time, manipulate smaller volumes of liquids and provide quantified results with better precision. Molecular techniques have revolutionated the diagnosis of infectious diseases, particularly the diagnosis of viral diseases. Automation of these methods provides decrease in turnaround times, low contamination risk, ease of performance and speed, as well as the ability to have lower detection limits and to diminish cost per test. This review focuses on the application of molecular technology in the clinical virology laboratory. Table 1 summarizes the main molecular techniques used in clinical virology.",

The specificity of real-time PCR can also be increased by using fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) probes in the reaction mixture. Another approach to real-time PCR is the use of dual hybridization probes that uses two specially designed sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes. Finally, detection and quantitation of amplification products can be carried out with molecular beacons.

Transcriptionbased amplification systems have several characteristics such as no requirement for a thermal cycler, rapid kinetics and a single-stranded RNA product that does not require denaturation prior to detection. Gen-Probe has developed TMA-based assays for detection of HCV and HIV-1, while NASBA-based kits (bioM\u00e9rieux) have developed commercially available kits for the detection and quantitation of HIV-1 RNA and CMV RNA and detection of enterovirus and respiratory syncytial virus RNA.",

Several methods can be used to detect the cleavage products, but Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) probes and a second invasive cleavage reaction to detect the target-specific products is the most common technique used. FRET occurs due to the interaction between the electronic excited states of two dye molecules. FRET probes are a pair of fluorescent probes placed in close proximity. The excitation is transferred from one dye molecule to the other without emission of a photon. The acceptor fluorophore emits light which is detected in specific channels.

Studies suggest that the detection of CMV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is highly sensitive and specific for CMV neurologic disease [45] . CMV DNA could be detected by conventional PCR in the CSF of HIV patients [46] but is rarely detected in HIVinfected patients without clinical neurological disease. CMV viral load testing using PCR techniques (including real-time PCR) or hybrid capture assays can detect and quantify CMV DNA or DNA-RNA hybrids in clinical specimens, including the CSF [47] . CMV viral load assays can be performed quickly, but it is important to use the same assay while monitoring an individual patient.

Because of this, there is a need for a rapid and accurate diagnostic test for HSV CNS diseases, so CSF PCR testing has been evaluated as a diagnostic test for HSV encephalitis and meningitis, being a rapid and a very high sensitivity and specificity diagnostic tool [48] . However, because neither the sensitivity nor specificity is 100%, HSV PCR results should be interpreted with caution. False-negative HSV PCR results could be possible and false-positive HSV PCR results can be also possible due to eventual contamination. Even so, currently it has been established that molecular amplification of HSV DNA is the new gold standard for the laboratory diagnosis of these infections.",

Active BK virus nephropathy is associated with high quantitative levels of BK virus DNA, and resolution of nephropathy was correlated with decreased DNA virus level in urine. However, although it is a sensitive test, the presence of BK virus DNA in this kind of samples does not necessarily means a true infection because there is asymptomatic reactived infection in 10-45% of renal transplant patients. Therefore, the result should be confirmed using blood samples [70] . In this sense, research has demonstrated that renal transplant recipients with higher urine DNA levels are more likely to show detectable DNA in blood.

Assays to quantify hepatitis B and C virus load in liver tissue have also been described [83, 84] . HBV DNA detection and HBV DNA viral load are also essential to explore a viral reactivation. Real-time PCR quantification assays are widely used because of their sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, broad dynamic range and positive predictive values. The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined international standards [85] . However, because of these techniques do not use the same HBV primers, follow up of patients should be carried out with the same technical assay in order to compare viral DNA load evolution. With respect to the HBV genotypes, there is currently a need to perform it due to several factors such as the prediction of clinical outcomes and the association with response to interferon treatment [86] . Genotyping of chronic HBV infections can help practicing physicians identify those at risk of disease progression and determine optimal antiviral therapy.
