            "text": "This paper argues that journalists' discursive actions in an outbreak context manifest in identifiable rhetorical motifs, which in turn influence the delivery of biomedical information by the media in such a context. Via a critical approach grounded in rhetorical theory, I identified three distinct rhetorical motifs influencing the reportage of health information in the early days of the H1N1 outbreak. A public-health motif was exhibited in texts featuring a particular health official and offering the statements of such an official as a mechanism of reassurance. A concealment-of-information motif was exhibited in texts emphasizing the importance of the transparency of health officials, and in texts demonstrating ambivalence about information provided by socially-sanctioned sources. Finally, in texts mythologizing the outbreak to the exclusion of other functions of the text (e.g., conveying who is at risk, protective behaviours, symptoms), I identified a pandemic motif. Each motif differs in the conclusions it offers to audiences seeking to gauge relative levels of risk, and to receive information about protective behaviours. I suggest that one means of interpreting the manifestation of distinct rhetorical motifs in the context of a high-risk health threat is the certainty that this context alters moral responsibilities, consequently influencing the manifestation of narrative role.",

Here is, of course, why infection and contagion are such loaded notions: they broadcast the kinds of riddles that Oedipus encountered with the Sphinx but locate them in the somatic logic and susceptibility of the human body, a logic that, for laypeople, can be as forbidding and unknowable as quantum physics. (Weinstein 2003: 107) Journalists may see themselves as those \"who [decide] what people need to know\" (Singer 1998) . Such an interpretive role is exceptionally relevant in an outbreak context, as it is commonly recognized that key to protection is behavioural change (e.g., Bults, Beaujean, de Zwart et al. 2011; Jones and Salath\u00e9 2009) . It is also during the early days of an outbreak when the likelihood of controlling it is greatest (Jones and Salath\u00e9 2009 ). According to the World Health Organization (2005) , in infectious disease outbreaks where there is no vaccine or cure, the only protection available may be behavioural change (24).",

Consequently, the processes by which health information reaches non-expert audiences are significant under these conditions. Olsson and Nord (2015) note that there is a need for research investigating the function of media coverage as one source of information in a crisis, particularly reporting in the context of an ongoing crisis . These researchers also observe that traditionally, the nature of journalism as it occurs in the context of a crisis has been neglected in crisis communication research (345) . I suggest that these observations become even more salient in the context of a biomedical crisis, where rapid dissemination of protective information may directly impact the duration of the crisis.",

            "text": "The discipline of rhetoric, as the study of practical communication, offers a body of theory that can be applied to analyze how texts function to persuade. Rhetoric can be briefly characterized as a discipline interested in the persuasive elements of discourse and communicative artifacts more broadly. Through a rhetorical lens, discourse is seen as having intention, as being addressed, and as taking place in a specific context that exerts shaping power on what is expressed (Bitzer 1968 ). Key to rhetorical study is a sensitivity to the symbolic dimension of communicative elements. Through humans' ingrained ability to comprehend and create symbols, we are refined receptors-not always consciously-of messages operating at symbolic levels (Burke 1973; Foss 2017) . This paper explores, first, the question of what discursive (\"symbolic\") actions journalists perform in an outbreak context, and second, the question of how an outbreak context impacts the ways journalists enact their conceptions of the journalistic role. Both phenomena impact how biomedical information is conveyed to the public. While the influence of occupational ideology on the enactment of one's conception of journalism has been investigated (e.g., Shoemaker 1991; Deuze 2005) , in the immediacy of certain contexts (such as a novel infectious disease outbreak), my findings suggest that slippage exists between journalists' ethical responsibilities as journalists and their responsibilities as human beings; and between health and science journalism, and simply \"news.\" In these situations, journalists are aware that media stories may be the basis for public actions and public policy having consequences measured in degrees of human health or, more rarely, in lives.",

This is illustrated by a number of direct quotes from the featured source (e.g., regional official Dr. Michael Gardam in Alphonso 2009 ). The rhetor invites the audience to identify with this source, via the number of direct quotes from Dr. Gardam as opposed to any other authority in the piece, many of which feature the first-person pronoun (i.e., \"In my mind\"; \"I understand that\"; \"I am assuming\"; \"My own personal opinion\"; \"if I was planning\"; \"if I was hearing\"; \"I would probably rethink\"). Direct quotes from other health authorities are in contrast shorter and fewer in number; more often paraphrasing occurs instead. The portrayal of Dr. Gardam functions to discredit the elements of reassurance provided through other authorities-such as the WHO-represented in the text. This featured source (Dr. Gardam) becomes the agency by which the journalist influences how the scene is viewed.",

It should be noted that water is not a recognized vector for influenza transmission. 1 Concern for audience needs, and consequently recognition of audience agency, is given somewhat greater prominence, as the outbreak and its attendant health threats are presented from a perspective contrasting with the sanctioned one (e.g., the contention, represented at the time by the Public Health Agency of Canada, that it is still safe for Canadians to travel to Mexico).",

These texts convey high anxiety, describing the beginning of a longforecasted pandemic and its anticipated impacts, both biological and economic.

Texts feature terms such as \"mutated\"; \"multi-strain\"; and \"pandemictype\" ) to describe the virus. Texts here do not suggest means of protection, at the level of individuals or otherwise. In sum, a pandemic is to be feared and this is reflected in the terminology used to describe it. Reassurance is largely absent and avenues of protection do not exist: rather than offering the development of a vaccine as reassuring, journalists emphasize that currently there is no vaccine (e.g., ). The outbreak is portrayed as a threat to all of humanity.",

A specific newspaper, the Tuoi Tre, \"[induced] the Vietnamese government to concede that an avian influenza outbreak was under way\" (243). The actions of Vietnamese journalists who worked to convey to their audiences the technical content and significance of dissonance among authorities regarding control of H5N1 led to the administration's public acknowledgement of an avian influenza epidemic (243).

However, arguments for the influence of distinct journalistic roles in coverage of a discrete news event have been made. Stocking and Holstein (2009) observed, for example, that \"Journalists' use of [sources'] claims appeared to vary largely as a function of their perceptions of their journalistic roles and of their audiences\" (23). In the authors' case study, reporters needed to evaluate specialized claims on a specific topic in spite of a lack of knowledge of the topic. Stocking and Holstein describe findings interpreted in light of Weaver and Wilhoit's four roles (adversarial, populist mobilizer, disseminator, and interpretive/investigative), suggesting that these roles guided individual journalists in determining \"what was left in and what was left out\" (32).",

The adoption of a \"narrative\" role is a way to transcend the limitations of an occupational role in a public-communication context with moral impacts. The outbreak of a new pandemic-type virus creates unique contingencies that influence the manifestation of narrative roles. The adoption of role as suggested here is not undertaken frivolously; it is done with the intent of fundamentally altering one's access to, and ability to wield, rhetorical power.",

Lee Wilkins (2005) suggests that the investigation of role as most commonly conducted, and as often anchored in the two decades of findings led by Weaver, excludes manifestations of role in outbreaks and similar disaster situations.

With respect to the pandemic motif, when the journalist participates in mythologizing the outbreak to the exclusion of other functions of the text (such as conveying who is at risk, describing protective behaviours, describing symptoms), the journalist's motivation arises primarily from the magnitude of the scene-the new disease and its potential impact. Means of protection are absent from media stories and terms such as \"plague\" and \"explosion\" are used to characterize the \"scene\" of the outbreak (e.g., ). In this drama, the audience is united. To use Priscilla Wald's terminology, when we acknowledge common susceptibility, we accept common humanity (2007: 54). Consequently, I suggest the purpose of journalists adopting this role is to warn audiences against one universal threat. This role is also un-represented in existing literature. Nerlich and Koteyko (2012) note that the H1N1 outbreak highlighted the \"increasing entanglement between the spread of disease and the spread of information.\" Traditional media maintains significance in social media contexts during crises. Schultz et al. (2011) found that, in their analysis of crisis communication in social media, newspaper articles featured more frequently as topics of discussion than blog or tweet content. In terms of \"shares\" on Twitter, the authors found, similarly, that content drawn from traditional media (specifically, newspapers) was more likely to be shared, than content from a blog or tweet. A suggested interpretation of this pattern is that \"newspapers might be perceived as more reliable and neutral\" (Schultz et al. 2011) .",

Even with the burgeoning uptake of social media, Jones and Salath\u00e9 (2009) found that audiences still preferred traditional media as a source of information during the H1N1 outbreak, even while public health organizations such as the CDC add social media to their outbreak communication strategies.

Kenneth Burke asserts that \"different frameworks of interpretation will lead to different conclusions as to what reality is\" (1984: 35). I argue that divergent rhetorical motifs influence the delivery of health information by the media in the context of a pandemic. First, the public health motif supported a view of the outbreak as posing little threat, and as easily managed by the health care system. The \"evidence\" for this motif originated in clusters of association in which the H1N1 virus was linked with the term \"mild,\" with \"common flu,\" and was dissociated from the term \"pandemic,\" which in some texts was completely absent. H1N1 was also dissociated from the more frightening, more dangerous SARS outbreak. Health officials are hierarchically privileged, and journalist-rhetors are fully engaged in the communication of protective information, refraining from meta-commentary on the nature of the scene or the content of officials' remarks. Audiences accepting this motif, despite being provided with information regarding personal protective measures, could place their faith in the protective capacity of the public health system and dissociate themselves from implementing steps to maintain health.",

Here, the vulnerability of the public health system appears, with some authorities expressing \"concern.\" Audiences subscribing to this motif could deflect risk through symbolic means as opposed to implementing protective behaviours (e.g., the threat is not biological in nature, but rather is a potential lack of transparency on the part of authorities).",

Journalist-rhetors featuring this motif view the challenge as the intensely dramatic nature of the outbreak, and function to \"mythologize\" the outbreak to the exclusion of other functions of the text. Texts exhibiting this motif do not offer reassurance of any kind. Texts exhibiting this motif reject possibilities of \"mild\" disease and of the outbreak tapering off. These texts create anxiety but offer no way to address it. The scene is an impending disaster of cosmic proportions. Audiences subscribing to this motif could experience high anxiety. In this scene there are no \"protectors\" identified, as who can protect from such a disaster? I argue that journalists shape health and crisis information according to the guiding role with which they identify in the pandemic context. The symbolic discursive processes evident in this context pose a neglected and therefore fruitful area of roles research. The extension of roles research to contexts likely to lead to the emergence of atypical roles would broaden understanding of how information reaches publics in these circumstances, and generate insight into the impact of crises on more traditional occupational roles. The potential for the development of a typology of narrative roles that could be applied heuristically to public discourse in high-risk health threat contexts warrants further investigation.",
