A new lead compound 3 (6577871) was identified via high-throughput screening of a diverse chemical library. Subsequently, we carried out lead optimization and structure-activity studies to provide a series of improved inhibitors that show potent PLpro inhibition and antiviral activity against SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells. Interestingly, the (S)-Me inhibitor 15h (enzyme IC 50 = 0.56 \u03bcM; antiviral EC 50 = 9.1 \u03bcM) and the corresponding (R)-Me 15g (IC 50 = 0.32 \u03bcM; antiviral EC 50 = 9.1 \u03bcM) are the most potent compounds in this series, with nearly equivalent enzymatic inhibition and antiviral activity. A protein-ligand X-ray structure of 15g-bound SARS-CoV PLpro and a corresponding model of 15h docked to PLpro provide intriguing molecular insight into the ligand-binding site interactions. . \u2020 The PDB accession code for 15g-bound PLpro X-ray structure is 3MJ5.",

Not surprisingly, numerous studies related to the development of SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors have already been reported. 8, 9 In contrast, very few inhibitor design efforts against SARS-CoV PLpro have been reported. We recently reported the discovery and design of a series of unprecedented noncovalent SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors displaying antiviral activity against SARS-CoV with no associated cytotoxicity. 10 Subsequently, a protein-ligand X-ray structure provided important molecular insights for further design and optimization of inhibitors. 10 This initial work demonstrated that PLpro is a viable target for the development of anti-SARS therapeutics.",

Both leads reproducibly inhibited PLpro in a dose dependent manner in the absence and presence of Triton-X. Subsequently, our optimization efforts of the most potent lead, 1 (7724772), containing a benzamide scaffold (IC 50 = 20.1 \u00b1 1.1 \u03bcM) led to the design of novel PLpro inhibitor 2 and related derivatives which displayed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV. We recently reported a detailed study describing synthesis, biological studies and X-ray structure of the proteinligand complex of 2-bound PLpro. 10 In our continuing studies toward the development of non-covalent/reversible PLpro inhibitors, we have now investigated the potential of the second and less potent lead that evolved from our high-throughput screening efforts. The second HTS lead, compound 3 (Figure 1) , contains a piperidine carboxamide scaffold and exhibited an IC 50 value of 59 \u03bcM. Our subsequent lead optimization efforts led to the design of potent inhibitor 15g (IC 50 = 0.32 \u03bcM) which inhibited SARS-CoV viral replication in Vero cells with an EC 50 value of 9.1 \u03bcM. The corresponding enantiomer 15h has shown slightly less potent enzyme inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 0.56 \u03bcM) and similar antiviral potency. A protein-ligand X-ray structure of 15g-bound SARS-CoV PLpro was determined. Interestingly, this structure revealed a unique mode of binding with SARS-CoV PLpro and that key molecular interactions of inhibitor 15g are quite different from the active-site interactions with inhibitor 2. Herein we describe the design, synthesis, structure-activity studies, molecular modeling, protein-ligand X-ray structure, and biological evaluation of a series of novel and noncovalent inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro.",

Fortunately, the spread of SARS-CoV was contained after the initial outbreaks through public health measures. As it turned out, the etiological agent of SARS is a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV. 2, 3 There have been no known new cases of SARS since 2005.

To enhance activity, we first investigated the effect of 2-methoxy and 3-methoxy derivatives 7a and 7b on PLpro inhibitory activity. As shown in Table 1 , 2-methoxy derivative 7a showed a very poor inhibitory activity. The 3-methoxy derivative, 7b, however, displayed slightly better activity than the starting lead 3. Our previous structure-activity of lead 1 established that 1-naphthyl ethyl amides were significantly more potent than the corresponding 2-naphthyl derivative. The X-ray structure of 2 bound to PLpro demonstrated that a (R)-1-naphthylethylamide forms hydrophobic interactions with the Tyr-265 and Tyr-269 aromatic rings and with side chains of Pro-248 and Pro-249. 10 The preference for (R)-methyl was also documented as it points into the interior of the enzyme between Tyr-265 and Thr-302. Based upon this ligand-binding site interaction, we elected to incorporate the (R)-methyl group. As shown in Table 1 , the (R)methyl derivative 15a displayed an IC 50 value of 1.2 \u03bcM. To ascertain the importance of the position of the methoxy group, we synthesized o-methoxy and m-methoxy derivatives. Interestingly, m-methoxy derivative 15b exhibited improvement of enzyme inhibitory activity with an IC 50 value of 0.34 \u03bcM. The corresponding p-methoxy derivative 15c have also shown similar potency enhancement (>170-fold over 3). However, the 2-methoxy derivative 15a showed a 3-fold reduction in potency over 15b and 15c. We then examined the effect of 2-(R)-naphthylethyl derivatives on potency. As shown, both m-methoxy and omethoxy benzylamides 15d and 15e displayed significant reductions in potency compared to the 1-(R)-naphthylethyl derivatives 15b and 15a, respectively.

Our preliminary modeling studies indicated that either methoxy oxygen (meta or para) is within proximity to form a hydrogen bond with the Gln-270 carboxamide side chain. Based upon these possible interactions, we incorporated a benzodioxolane ring and examined its effect on inhibitory potency. As shown in Table 2 , dioxolane derivative 15g exhibits potency comparable to the corresponding m-and pderivatives 15b and 15c. The corresponding (S)-derivative 15h also shows comparable enzyme inhibitory activity. To examine the preference for a methyl group over a hydrogen at the 1-and 2-naphthylmethyl positions, we have synthesized and evaluated the corresponding unsubstituted derivatives 15i and 15j. As shown, both compounds displayed significant reduction in potency, indicating the importance of the methyl group. We have also examined the corresponding gem-dimethyl derivative 15k. Interestingly, this compound is inactive, indicating that both methyl groups cannot be accommodated by the PLpro active site. Antiviral activities of selected PLpro inhibitors were determined, and the results are shown in Table 3 . The compounds were assayed for their ability to rescue a Vero cell culture from SARS-CoV infection. The viability of virus-infected Vero E6 cells as a function of inhibitor concentration was measured relative to mock-infected cells using a luminescence assay. This protocol allows for the evaluation of both inhibitor efficacy and cytotoxicity. As can be observed from the data presented in Table 3 , the original HTS lead (3) does not show any antiviral activity. However, all 2-, 3-and 4-methoxy derivatives 15a-c show comparable antiviral activity. Inhibitor 15f with a 2-naphthyl substituent displayed no antiviral activity. While the (R)-methyl derivative 15g showed slightly better enzyme activity than the (S)methyl derivative 15h, both inhibitors exhibited the same antiviral potency (EC 50 = 9.1 \u03bcM). Interestingly, both dioxolane derivatives 15g and 15h showed antiviral activity approximately comparable to the corresponding methoxy or benzamide derivatives reported in our previous studies. 10 To obtain molecular insight into the ligand-binding site interactions, the X-ray crystal structure of 15g bound to PLpro was determined. Interestingly, the binding mode and key molecular interactions of inhibitor 15g are quite different than predicted and are different from the active-site interactions with the benzamide-derived inhibitors we previously reported. As shown in Figure 2 , the inhibitor binds to the active via a series of interactions including a hydrogen-bond formed between the carboxamide NH of the inhibitor and the backbone carbonyl of Tyr-269, with 15g wrapped around the beta-turn. The 15g bound PLpro crystal structure also confirms the presence of a few structural water molecules conserved between the apo enzyme (PDB id:2FE8) and inhibitor 2 bound PLpro (PDB id: 3E9S). One of the conserved water molecules sits in the P5 pocket shown in Figure 2 as spheres between residues Asp-165, Asp-303 and Thr-302 preventing the inhibitor naphthyl rings from occupying this pocket. In the stereo image of 15g bound PLpro we also show two other water molecules near residue Leu-163 and Lys-158 that may prevent the benzodioxolane ring from flipping down toward Lys-158. Figure 3 superimposes 15g and our previously developed inhibitor, 2, 10 and demonstrates that the binding mode differs significantly between the two inhibitors. Interestingly, the turn region between Tyr-269 and Gln-270 also shows significant flexibility, particularly in the case of inhibitor 2 (PDB id: 3E9S), where the peptide bond between Tyr-269 and Gln-270 flips by 180 degrees to enable a hydrogen bond interaction between the backbone nitrogen of Tyr-269 and the carboxamide oxygen in inhibitor 2. The carboxyamide nitrogen makes a hydrogen bond with the side chain carboxylate of Asp-165. The carboxy amide nitrogen of inhibitor 15g (yellow) forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Tyr-269 (protein shown in grey). The naphthyl rings of both inhibitors 2 and 15g align in a similar fashion in the hydrophobic pocket formed by residues Tyr-269, Tyr-265, Pro-248-249, and Thr-302. The overlapping position of one conserved water molecule observed for both the inhibitor 2-bound PLpro (oxygen atom shown as sphere in pink) crystal structure and inhibitor 15g-bound PLpro (oxygen atom shown as sphere in red) crystal structure is shown as overlapping spheres.",

From this model, we observe an inversion of the piperidine ring between the (R)-Me and (S)-Me binding modes that allows the naphthyl rings of both isomers to be accommodated in the active site in very similar orientations. The flexible piperidine ring also acts as a spacer group that enables the carboxamide NH of both 15h and 15g to hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Tyr-269 in a similar fashion, thereby retaining the potency of both enantiomers. However, the gem-dimethyl substitution in 15k decreases the freedom around the carbon atom and locks the compound in a conformation where one of the methyl groups exhibits a bumping collision with the side chain of Asp-165. One of the methyl groups in 15k shifts almost 1.2 \u00c5 toward residue Asp-165 when compared to the single methyl substitution (R)-Me in 15g, as can be seen in Figure 4B . It is important to note that the side chain of this Asp-165 is locked in its position by a hydrogen bond with the backbone NH of Arg-167. Hence, the gem-dimethyl substitution is not favorably accommodated in the active site, because in order to fit the hydrophobic methyl group near the hydrophilic residue, the aspartic acid side chain would have to move out, thereby breaking structural hydrogen bonding with Arg-167. This hypothesis is further validated by the GoldScore scoring function of GOLDv4.1 during the docking study. Compound 15k is heavily penalized due to an unfavorable internal energy term (-12 compared to \u223c -6 for both 15g and 15h) which is a sum of the internal torsional strain and internal van der Waals energy terms of the ligand. Docking with flexible residues also suggests that the Gln-270 side chain may adopt conformations that might enable hydrogen bonding interactions with one of the 1,3 benzodioxolane oxygens in 15g and 15h (within 3\u00c5). However, all docked conformations generated for 15k shows a loss of this hydrogen bonding interaction. The closest benzodioxolane oxygen of 15k is at least 4.8\u00c5 away from the side chain of Gln-270 (not shown). Figure 4B highlights the potential bumping collision of one of the methyl groups of 15k with Asp-165, demonstrating that two methyl groups cannot be accommodated favorably at this position.",

Diffraction-quality crystals grew from a sitting drop containing 5 mg/mL PLpro, 1 mM 15g, 1 M (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 50 mM MES, pH 6.5, and 2.5% PEG 400. Crystals were flashfrozen in liquid nitrogen and then transferred into a dry nitrogen stream at 100 K for X-ray data collection. The data set of the complex was collected at the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Data were processed and scaled using the HKL2000 program suite. Crystals belonged to the spacegroup C2, with two monomers in the asymmetric unit. The inhibitor-complexed structure was solved to 2.63 \u00c5 by molecular replacement using the SARS-CoV PLpro apoenzyme structure (PDB entry: 2FE8) as a search model in the AMoRe program of the CCP4 suite. Manual model building was performed using Wincoot, and iterative rounds of positional & B-factor refinement and map building were performed using CNS. The structure was deposited under PDB Code: 3MJ5.
