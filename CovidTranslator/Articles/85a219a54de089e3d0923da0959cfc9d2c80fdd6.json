Results ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) as a 35 kDa protein. It had a K m of 26 lM with the fluorogenic peptide Dabcyl-KTSAVLQS GFRKME-Edan. The purified ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro was used for inhibition and kinetic assays to determine the activities of 22 polyphenol compounds. These polyphenol compounds at 100 lM inhibited the activity of ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro by 6.2-88%. Seven polyphenol compounds had IC 50 ranging from 22 \u00b1 0.2 to 112 \u00b1 5.5 lM. Myricetin showed a mixed type inhibitory pattern against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro protease. Its IC 50 value was 22 \u00b1 0.2 lM with a K i value of 8.9 \u00b1 1.9 lM. Conclusion The chemical structure of a polyphenol compound and its inhibitory activity against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro can be explored to develop highly selective inhibitors against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro .",

Before this outbreak, ZIKV was not viewed as an important pathogen because the majority of its infections are asymptomatic (Duffy et al. 2009 ). However, there is now growing evidence showing that ZIKV infections Hee-jung Lim and Thi Thanh Hanh Nguyen contributed equally to this work.",

NS3 protein of ZIKV possesses putative protease activity at its N-terminus and putative ATPase/helicase, nucleoside triphosphatase, and 5 0 -triphosphatase activities at its C-terminus (Zhu et al. 2016 ). The polyprotein is cleaved co-translationally and post-translationally by cellular proteases of furin-type or Golgi-localized proteases. The viral serine protease is embedded in the N-terminal domain of NS3 (NS3 pro ) (Bollati et al. 2010 ).

It was inserted into pET28a vector (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) (pET28a-NS2B-NS3 pro ) for the expression of NS2B-NS3 pro enzyme with poly-histidine tags in both N-terminal and C-terminal ends. The protein encoding NS2B-NS3 pro comprised of 49 NS2B amino acid residues (amino acid residues 1421-1469) were linked by a flexible GGGGSGGGG linker with 186 NS3 pro amino acid residues (amino acid residues 1503-1688) (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). pET28a-NS2B-NS3 pro was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) which was then grown in LB supplemented with kanamycin (50 lg ml -1 ) at 37\u00b0C. Cells were induced with 0.5 mM IPTG when the OD 600 reached 0.5. Induced cells were kept at 16\u00b0C for 12 h at 200 rpm. Cells were collected by centrifugation (80009g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C), resuspended in 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.0), and lysed via sonication. After centrifugation (12,0009g for 30 min), the cell lysate was loaded onto 8 ml Ni-agarose resin. Proteins were eluted from the column with elution buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, 30 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH 8). Fractions containing pure protein were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7). The concentration of protein was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Purified protein was confirmed by 12% SDS-PAGE.",

It requires the central hydrophilic domain of NS2B as a co-factor for enzymatic activity (Falgout et al. 1991; Lei et al. 2016) . Its cleavage sites have common Lys-Arg, Arg-Arg, Arg-Lys, or Gln-Arg motifs (Bessaud et al. 2006; Lei et al. 2016) . ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro was designed to compose 49 NS2B amino acid residues (amino acid residues 1421-1469) linked by a flexible GGGGSGGGG linker with 186 NS3 pro amino acid residues (amino acid residues 1503-1688) ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). It was cloned and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). The purification of recombinant ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro was achieved in a single Ni-agarose chromatography with 21-fold purification. SDS-PAGE analyses revealed a protein band of approximately 35 kDa ( Fig. 1a) with over 80% in purity.

Polyphenols fisetin, quercetin, anringin, and rutin can inhibit dengue virus, a member of the family Flaviviridae that also contains ZIKV (Zandi et al. 2011) . Therefore, in this study, 18 flavonid compounds belonging to four groups of flavonoids (flavonol, 6 compounds; flavanol, 8 compounds; flavone, 2 compounds; flavanone, 2 compounds) and four non-flavonoid type phenolic compounds (pyrogallol, pyrocatechol, caffeic acid, and gallic acid) were selected to test their inhibitory activities against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro . The structures of these compounds are shown in Fig. 2 . Results on the inhibitory activities of these polyphenol compounds at 100 lM against NS2B-NS3 pro are shown in Table 1 . Among these tested compounds, myricetin, astragalin, rutin, epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechin gallate, gallocatechin gallate, and luteolin at 100 lM inhibited more than 40% of the activities of ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro .

The methoxy group at C4 0 in the B-ring and the prenyl group at C8 position in the A-ring of icaritin might have contributed to its lower inhibitory activity against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro . Myricetin contains three OH groups on its B-ring. Ampelopsin has the same three OH groups at its B-ring but lacks the double bond between the C2 and C3 positions in its B-ring. The absence of the double bond in ampelopsin might have decreased its inhibitory activity against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro . This may be the primarily reason why ampelopsin had lower inhibitory activity than myricetin. Quercetin had lower inhibitory activity compared to myricetin, luteolin, and astragalin. Rutin having glycosylation at C3 position in the C-ring but no OH group at C3 0 in the B-ring had higher inhibitory activity than quercetin, although their inhibitory activities were lower than those of myricetin and luteolin. These results suggest that the presence of OH group at C3 0 , C4 0 , and C5 0 in the B-ring is very important for the inhibitory activity of flavonols against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro while the absence of OH group or glycosylation at C3 position in the C-ring of flavonols only has slight effect on its inhibitory activity against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro . Hesperidin and naringin belong to flavanones. They have a single bond between the C2 and C3 positions in the C-ring. They showed weak inhibitory activities against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro , indicating that bulky glycosylation at C7 in the A-ring can decrease their inhibition activities against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro . EGCG, EGCG-7-O-a-glucopyranoside, EGCG-4 0 -O-a-glucopyranoside, epigallocatechin, catechin gallate, catechin, ECG, and GCG belong to flavanol class of compounds. They lack the double bond (between the C2 and C3 positions) and C4=O in the C-ring. EGCG, EGCG-7-O-a-glucopyranoside, EGCG-4 0 -O-a-glucopyranoside, catechin gallate, ECG, and GCG contain galloyl moiety at the 3-OH position in the C-ring. They showed higher inhibitory activities against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro than epigallocatechin and catechin. EGCG, ECG, and GCG (epimer of EGCG) showed similar inhibition activities. There was no significant difference in inhibitory activity against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro between epigallocatechin and catechin, indicating that the OH group at C5 0 in the B-ring does not affect their inhibitory activities. EGCG-7-O-a-glucopyranoside and EGCG-4 0 -O-a-glucopyranoside showed lower inhibitory activities against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro than EGCG due to glycosylation at C7 position in A-ring and C4 0 position in B-ring, respectively. In summary, Of 22 polyphenol compounds tested against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro , seven had IC 50 values of 22 \u00b1 0.2 to 112 lM. Based on structure-activity relationships of these compounds against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro , the double bonds between C2 and C3 in the B-ring, OH groups at C7 in the A-ring, C2 in the C-ring, C3 0 , C4 0 , and C5 0 in the B-ring, and galloyl moiety at C3 in the C-ring all played important roles in the inhibition activities against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro . These relationships between chemical structures and inhibitory activities against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro can be further explored to develop highly selective inhibitors against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 pro .",
