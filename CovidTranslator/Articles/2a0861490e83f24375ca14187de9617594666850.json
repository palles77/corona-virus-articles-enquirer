            "text": "Serum autoantibodies from a patient with autoantibodies directed against the Golgi complex were used to screen clones from a HepG2 XZ_ap cDNA library. Three related clones, designated SY2, SY10, and SYll, encoding two distinct polypeptides were purified for further analysis. Antibodies affinity purified by adsorption to the XZ_ap-cloned recombinant proteins and antibodies from NZW rabbits immunized with purified recombinant proteins reproduced Golgi staining and bound two different proteins, 95 and 160 kD, from whole cell extracts. The SYll protein was provisionally named golgin-95 and the SY2/SY10 protein was named golgin-160. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA clone of SY2 and SYll represented 58.7-and 70-kD proteins of 568 and 620 amino acids. The in vitro translation products of SY2 and SYll cDNAs migrated in SDS-PAGE at 65 and 95 kD, respectively. The in vitro translated proteins were immunoprecipitated by human anti-Golgi serum or immune rabbit serum, but not by normal human serum or preimmune rabbit serum. Features of the cDNA suggested that SY11 was a full-length clone encoding golgin-95 but SY2 and SY10 together encoded a partial sequence of golgin-160. Analysis of the SY11 recombinant protein identified a leucine zipper spanning positions 419-455, a glutamic acid-rich tract spanning positions 322-333, and a proline-rich tract spanning positions 67-73. A search of the SwissProt data bank indicated sequence similarity of SYll to human restin, the heavy chain of kinesin, and the heavy chain of myosin. SY2 shared sequence similarity with the heavy chain of myosin, the USO1 transport protein from yeast, and the 150-kD cytoplasmic dynein-associated polypeptide. Sequence analysis demonstrated that golgin-95 and golgin-160 share 43% sequence similarity and, therefore, may be functionally related proteins.",

Structurally, the Golgi complex is localized in the perinuclear region of most mammalian cells and is characterized by stacks of membranebound cisternae as well as a functionally distinct trans-Golgi network (16, 17) . The intraceUular transport of newly synthesized and recycled proteins requires directed movement between the endoplasmic reticulum, the intracdlular vesicles to the c/s, medial, and trans compartments of the Golgi complex, and the plasma membrane (15, 18, 19) . The signals and molecular characteristics of the proteins that control this intracellular traffic are poorly understood, but it is known that intraceUular microtubules are important structural and functional components (20, 21) . Constituent and resident proteins of the Golgi complex bdieved to play a role in these processes include families of Proteins such as the adaptins (22) , the \"coatomer\" proteins (e.g., cz,fl,%/~ COPs) 1 (23) (24) (25) , GTP-binding proteins (26) , including ADP ribosylation factors (ARFs) (27, 28) , and resident enzymes (reviewed in reference 14) .",

The prototype serum (Fig. 8 a, lane 8) and another anti-Golgi serum (Fig. 8 a, lane 9 ) also did not precipitate the SY2 in vitro translation product. The lower molecular mass translation products of SY2 also appeared to be specifically immunopredpitated by the immune rabbit sera, indicating the presence of at least one epitope in these smaller fragments. The observation that rabbits immunized with SY2 or SY10 immunoprecipitated the in vitro translation product of SY2 is in agreement with the conclusion that there was \",~95% overlap of the SY2 and SY10 clones. The reason why the prototype human serum or other anti-Golgi sera did not immunoprecipitate the in vitro translated SY2 product is not clear. For example, the recombinant proteins produced by SY2 and SY11 in E. coli were reactive with anti-Golgi sera previously shown to recognize golgin-160 and golgin-95 in whole cell extracts (Fig. 8 , c and d, lane I). The prototype serum ( Fig. 7 d and 8 c, lane 2), affinity-purified antibodies to SY2 (Fig. 8 c, lane 3) and SY11 (Fig. 8 d, lane 3) , and rabbit serum raised against SY2 (Fig. 8 c, lane 4) and SY 11 (Fig. 8 , d, lane 4) also reacted with the recombinant protein. Normal human serum (Fig. 8 , c and d, lane 5) and preimmune rabbit serum (data not shown) did not react with the purified recombinant proteins. The data suggest that the epitopes critical for human antibody binding are present on the recombinant protein derived from the original X phage and the subcloned pBluescript plasmid but that they are not present on the in vitro transcribed and translated protein.",

At 0 and 2 min, the Golgi staining remained typical of untreated cells (Fig. 9, a and b) .

Rabbit antibodies raised against SY2 (lane I) react with a 160-kD protein that has the same molecular mass as the fainter upper band reacting with the prototype serum (lane 2). Rabbit antibodies raised against SYll (lane 3) react strongly with a 95-kD protein that has the same molecular mass as a band recognized by the prototype serum (lane 2). Lane 4 represents the reactivity of a rabbit serum (1:50) 2 wk after immunization with SY10. Lane 5 was probed with an immune rabbit serum 2 wk after a boost with the recombinant SY10 protein. This serum reacted with the 160-kD protein and several other lower molecular mass proteins. Lanes 6 and 7 are preimmune rabbit serum and normal human serum, respectively.",

In this regard, it is interesting that golgin-95 and golgin-160 showed significant sequence similarity to several cytoskeleton-related proteins, including kinesin (72), the 150-kD dynein-associated protein (73) , the myosin family proteins (heavy chain myosin, tropomyosin), and desmin. Kinesin is a microtubule-stimulated ATPase (74, 75) and a likely motor protein for organdie transport along microtubules. The sequence similarity of the golgins with these proteins is only ~21%, but the aligned sequences span >300 amino acids in or-helical domains of these proteins. This suggests that the Golgi complex has unique motor proteins that are part of the myosin family. Another observation that supports this conclusion is that golgin-160 has sequence similarity to the yeast cytoskeleton-related protein USO1. It has been demonstrated that USO1 is required for protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus (76) .",

            "text": "In summary, autoantibodies from a patient with SLE have been used to identify, done, and sequence two apparently related Golgi-associated proteins having molecular masses of 95 and 160 kD. We have designated these proteins golgin-95 and golgin-160. The function(s) of these two proteins is unknown. Based on the analysis of the sequences of these proteins and the effects of BFA on their distribution, several possibilities can be considered. First, these proteins may be kinesin-like motor proteins that have a role in the transport of vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex or within the Golgi stack. Second, both proteins may form a cytoskeletal structure that is the framework for transport of Golgi vesicles. Sequence similarity of the cloned proteins to cytoskeleton-related proteins supports this possibility. The deduced secondary structure suggests a predominantly coiled-coil structure. Third, golgin-95 may be a structural protein within the Golgi complex responsible for protein transport. The presence of a leucine zipper, and stretches of acidic residues, is consistent with features of a coat protein. This is further substantiated by observations that the behavior of both proteins is similar to B-COP after BFA exposure. Studies using a number of cell biology and molecular tools can help determine the more precise roles of these proteins in the future. In the meantime, sera from patients with SLE continue to provide valuable reagents in the study of immune responses and the structure and function of key cellular organelles. Figure 8 . Immunoprecipitation of in vitro translation and transcription products of SYll and SY2. In vitro translation products derived from the SYll or SY2 plasmid templates linearized with SacI restriction enzyme and transcribed with T3 or T7 RNA polymerase. The [3sS]methionine-labeled in vitro translated products were incubated with rabbit or human serum and the antigen-antibody complexes adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose. The complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and the dried gel was processed and exposed to x-ray film to trace the bound antigen. (a) The translation product [3SSlmethionine-hbeled SY2 (lane I) migrated at 65 kD with smaller translation products also observed. The 65-kD [3sS]methionine-hbeled in vitro translated product was not immunoprecipitated by preimmune rabbit serum (lanes 2 and 5) but it was by antibodies from rabbits immunized with the SY2 recombinant protein (hnes 3 and 4) and rabbits immunized with SY10 (lanes 6 and 7) . .

(a) Comparison of the recombinant SY2, SY10, and SY11 cDNA inserts. SY11 is a 2.1-kb insert and it included 5' and 3' untranslated regions (small Mrs). SY2 (1.7 kb) and SY10 (1.6 kb) represented DNA inserts with ,~95% overlap. Neither SY2 nor SY10 was flanked by an untranslated stretch ofDNA. (b and c) Secondary structure predictions for SY2 (Golgin-160) and SY11 (Golgin-95) are illustrated in b and c, respectively. The secondary structure was predicted using the program Peptide Structure (47). The structure predicted for a domain is denoted by the position of the line (turns, ol-helices, B-sheets). The sequence analysis shows that SY2 (b) does not have any/3-shect structures and is exclusively an or-helical molecule. SYll (c) is predominantly an (xhelical model with some/~-sheet structure. Special features of the proline-rich domain, glutamic acidrich domain, coiled-coil (leucine zipper) motif, and a single putative glycosylatinn site identified in Fig. 3 are indicated. (d) Amino add comparison of SY11 and SY2 using Gap alignment. SY2 and SY11 demonstrate 22% sequence identity and 43% sequence similarity 9 79-kD Golgi antigen reacted with antibodies from a patient with an overlap syndrome of SLE and polymyositis and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively (7, 9). There are some differences between the antigens described in these reports and ours. First, the molecular masses of the native Golgi proteins identified in our study and theirs are different. In addition, the antigen in the study of Rossie et al. (7) was extracted from tissue culture cells after treatment with 0.1 N HC1. This is distinctly different from our antigen, which is resistant to 0.1 N HC1 treatment (4). Indeed, when HEp-2 cells were treated in this manner, the fluorescence was subjectively enhanced. Perhaps another protein that is extracted under these conditions partially masks an epitope on our protein in situ.In addition, although our antigens can be detected in the soluble fraction ofceUs, the majority of our proteins are found in the insoluble fraction (data not shown). Similarities be-tween our antigens and the 65-kD protein include resistance to detergent extraction, sensitivity to trypsin treatment, and preservation of staining after paraformaldehyde fixation. An interesting feature of golgin-95 is the presence of a coiled-coil motif (leucine zipper) characterized by six repeats of leucine residues at every seventh position (55). This motif is formed by two parallel amphipathic o~-helices, which structurally resembles a coiled-coil (56). Coiled-coil motifs have been noted in other autoantigens, including 52-kD SS-A/Ro(57) and the 80/86-kD Ku (58) autoantigens that react with autoantibodies present in SLE and Sj6gren's syndrome sera (reviewed in reference 3). The leucine zipper motif has also been described in a number of other prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins, most notably products of nuclear oncogenes, including c-fos and c-jun(59), viral fusogenic proteins (60,61), and the envelope glycoproteins of HIV1 and other viruses",
