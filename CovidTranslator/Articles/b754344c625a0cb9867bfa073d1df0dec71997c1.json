            "text": "Cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system comprise a widely distributed cell system that includes immature cells in the bone marrow, circulating monocytes and tissue macrophages. Macrophages are strategically placed at the portal of entry (e.g., the alveolar macrophages of the lung) and are widely distributed in most organs in close contact with the circulating blood (e.g., Kupffer cells of the liver). Thus they are in an ideal position to encounter viruses early in the infectious process (Mims, 1964) . Two types of macrophage antiviral activity have been defined in vitro (Morahan et al., 1979; Morse et al., 1981) namely intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic interaction refers to the outcome of virus replication in the macrophage per se. Macrophages may possess various degrees of intrinsic susceptibility (permissiveness) or resistance (non-permissiveness) to virus replication. This activity has been studied for many different viruses such as herpes simplex virus (Leary et al., 1989; G6rtz et al., 1984; Sethi et al., 1983 ), influenza virus (Roberts et al., 1985 , human immunodeficiency virus (Gendelman et al., 1989; Meltzer et al., 1991) , vaccinia virus (Keller et al., 1985) and mouse hepatitis virus (Keller et al., 1988) . Intrinsic resistance is most easily assayed by infecting macrophage cultures with a given virus (usually at a multiplicity of one infectious virus particle per macrophage) and determining virus growth (or presence of viral antigens) and infectious centers.",
