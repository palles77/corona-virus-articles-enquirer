Since then many advanced AUC detectors have been developed that provide a vast range of versatile choices when characterizing the physical and chemical features of macromolecules. In addition, there have been remarkable advances in software that allow the analysis of AUC data using more sophisticated models, including quaternary structures, conformational changes, and biomolecular interactions. Here we report the application of AUC to protein size-and-shape distribution analysis and structure-and-function analysis in the presence of ligands or lipids. Using band-sedimentation velocity, quaternary structural changes and an enzyme's catalytic activity can be observed simultaneously. This provides direct insights into the correlation between quaternary structure and catalytic activity of the enzyme. On the other hand, also in this study, we have applied size-and-shape distribution analysis to a lipid-binding protein in either an aqueous or lipid environment. The sedimentation velocity data for the protein with or without lipid were evaluated using the c(s,f r ) two-dimensional distribution model, which provides a precise and quantitative means of analyzing the protein's conformational changes.",

However, expensive instrumentation and laborious manual data handling somehow have resulted in this powerful instrument being ignored by most scientists. This situation has been changing since 1990s when computerized data acquisition becomes mature and was complemented by the launch of many sophisticated software packages that make the AUC data very informative. Furthermore, the development of various detectors, such as Schlieren optics, UV/VIS absorption, Rayleigh interference, fluorescence, light scattering, turbidity, and multiwavelength UV/VIS optics, has made AUC more versatile that never before [1] [2] [3] . These different detection and analysis methods have already promoted AUC to a new level that is able to provide a solid strategy for examining a pro-tein's quaternary structural state and conformational changes, as well as various heterogeneous biomolecular interactions [4] .",

In the first section, the main protease (Mpro) from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is chosen as an explicit example to illustrate the usefulness of AUC in enzyme research. The AUC method used here is band-sedimentation velocity, also known as active enzyme centrifugation [5, 6] . The detailed theoretical background and practical aspects have been thoroughly discussed [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . At that time, the complicated data analysis problems impeded the wide spread use of this technique [9] . The available literature on band-forming AUC is rather scarce. This has changed because advances in software have made handling huge datasets only a few keyboard strokes away [3, 4, 13, 14] . Taking advantage of this, we have successfully applied the active enzyme centrifugation technique to the dimeric SARS-CoV Mpro in which dimerization is required for its normal functioning [15, 16] . The enzyme was assayed by band-forming AUC at various concentrations of the substrates. The quaternary structural change and activities of the enzyme during the catalytic process are determined simultaneously. The enzyme velocities are then used in a kinetic model evaluation, which allows the derivation of the kinetic parameters K m , k cat , and the Hill coefficient for subunit cooperativity. All the results from the AUC support the existence of substrate-induced dimerization of Mpro, which is consistent with our other studies [16] .",

[17] [18] [19] . Most of these methods are not able to investigate delicate structural changes at the quaternary structure level as yet. In the second part of this study, we describe an elaborate application of sedimentation velocity (SV) to the analysis of changes in protein size-and-shape distribution in either an aqueous or lipid environment. The protein chosen for this study was human apolipoprotein E3 (apoE3), a lipid-binding protein found in blood that is responsible for lipid transfer between organs [20] . The sample used in this study was apoE3-(72-166), which is presumed to have an amphipathic ahelical structure [21] . The experiments were executed with and without lipids and then analyzed by c(s,f r ) two dimensional (2d) distribution model [13] . Instead of fitting the anhydrous frictional ratio (f r ) as a fix value, the 2d model is used to set a broad range for f r during data processing. This modification helps us quantitatively characterize the size-and-shape distribution of apoE3-(72-166) in an aqueous and in a lipid environment.",

Any increase in absorbance at 405 nm caused by para-nitroanilide (pNA) releasing was continuously monitored using a spectrophotometer.

Three sample solutions, with apoE3-(72-166) protein preincubated in PBS, PBS + 5 mM, or PBS + 50 mM DHPC were loaded into different cells. After balancing and putting a counterbalance into the last rotor chamber, the experiments were started at a rotor speed of 3000 rpm as a pre-scan check for sample leakage. When the vacuum was lower than 50 l and the temperature was stable at 20\u00b0C, the rotor speed was increased to 42,000 rpm and the absorbance at 280 nm monitored in a continuous mode at time intervals of 480 s and a step size of 0.003 cm.

The same species (S = 1.9, mass = 37.5 kDa, and R s = 4.4 nm) was found to be maintained in a more extended shape (f r > 2) in the submicellar solution (Fig. 5B) . At this stage, this will increase the protein's hydrophobic exposure such that protein polymerization is induced. That is why this species decreases and other larger species increase. This suggested that apoE3-(72-166) begins to maintain a looser, and more extended conformation in a submicellar environment. In 50 mM DHPC, 93% of the apoE3-(72-166) protein is dissociated to form an elongated monomer that has a smaller S value (1.0) and a larger R s value (3.0 nm) (Fig. 5C) . Furthermore, the f r contour of the apoE3-(72-166) monomer species in a 50 mM DHPC micellar solution shows a wider distribution compared to PBS.

The system becomes a practical tool for the analysis of bipolymer heterogeneity when UV/VIS absorption optics and Rayleigh interference optics were developed. The rebirth of modern AUC started in the 1990s when the acquisition and management of huge amount of data became feasible. Almost at the same time, some powerful programs such as SVEDBERG (<www.jphilo.mailway.com/svedberg.htm>) (cited August 1, com/sedphat>) (cited August 1, 2010), and SEDANAL (<http:// rasmb.bbri.org/software/windows/sedanal-stafford/>) (cited August 1, 2010) were also launched. Although AUC data analysis has reached a mature stage with comprehensive mathematics, some of the above-mentioned programs are still being updated by the developers every few months. Each update gives us more selections when analyzing AUC data. These advances in both instrumentation and software analysis have allowed AUC to be used to study more complicated structural change including those during the binding of ligands to the proteins. In our example, the dimerization of Mpro is induced by substrate binding and was detected by bandforming active enzyme centrifugation. The enzymatic reaction is followed by observing the absorbance change at 405 nm versus time. The kinetic data obtained suggest that the subunits of the wild-type dimer are cooperative during the catalytic cycle, which cannot be detected in some routine kinetic assays using a typical spectrometry or fluorescence instrument; nonetheless, this process can be clearly demonstrated in some Mpro mutants [16] . Thus using AEC on Mpro, it was possible to differentiate and identify the cooperativity that traditional enzyme kinetic assay might have missed.",

            "text": "However, the AEC technique that was employed in this study has some limitations. First of all, the enzymatic reaction usually has high efficiency. This means that very small amount of enzyme is sufficient to catalyze a reaction that can be detectable using a routine spectrophotometer, spectrofluorometer or other means. The protein peak usually is invisible under these assay conditions. There have been many successful applications of AEC in literature [5, 6, 8, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . In most cases, the sedimentation coefficients are derived from the release of the product, which is presumed to be produced by the catalytically active site and thus indicates the position of the active enzyme-substrate complex. Mpro is an ideal model system to demonstrate the usefulness of AEC using an in situ protein band system via direct determination as we noticed before [42] . The enzyme is a simple monomer-dimer system. The enzymatic reaction rate is moderate, and a large amount of protein is required for catalysis. In our case, the absorbance of the ligand and protein partially overlapped, the protein signal was severely interfered with by the high concentration of substrate. This resulted in a high level of system noise when the data is analyzed (Fig. 1B) . When the concentration of substrate is over 200 lM, the size distribution of the protein cannot be analyzed precisely. To circumvent this, the protein may be labeled with fluorescein [43] , which allows the protein fluorescence signal be detected at 494 nm. This may be able to separate the signal from the protein from that of the ligand. A fluorescence detector for AUC is good hardware to acquire in order to solving this problem, although the detector is expensive. (<www.avivbiomedical.com/aufds.php>) (cited April 29, 2010). Another limitation is the detection time. At a rotor speed of 42,000 rpm, each absorbance scan takes about 1 min. This is too long and enzyme activity might be underestimated for some highly active enzymes. It may be possible to circumvent this problem using an alternate substrate with a lower efficiency or a mutant enzyme with a lower enzymatic activity. Recently, a multiwavelength UV/VIS detection for AUC has been developed and successfully applied to investigating b-carotene-gelatin composite particles [2] . It can shorten the detection time by measuring several wavelengths simultaneously.",

Band-forming sedimentation velocity can follow quaternary structural changes of an active enzyme as the ligand is bound. The enzyme kinetic parameters thus obtained are comparable to those from routine enzyme kinetic assays, and may be more informative. The results of sedimentation velocity studies can be further explored by c(s,f r ) 2d distribution analysis, which provides information about the protein size-and-shape changes. Up to this moment, no other biophysical or biochemical methods can surpass AUC, which can be used over a few hours to examine protein quaternary structure or protein conformational changes. AUC can provide not only qualitative information, but also quantitative measurements that go a long way in explaining the interactions between biomolecules and their biological functions. The rapid progress of AUC in recent years, both hardware and software, has resulted in a situation, we strongly feel, where the powerfulness of AUC is somehow underestimated. With a wider use of AUC, especially when complemented with other delicate biophysical instruments, the datasets originating from AUC analysis of complicated biological phenomena will become manageable.",
