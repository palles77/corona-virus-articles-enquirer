It focuses on severe emerging diseases for which no, or insufficient, diagnostic, preventive and curative solutions exist, and which have the potential to generate a public health emergency.

These were subsequently expanded by WHO, and an outline of the eventual methodology was presented to, and validated by, the R&D Blueprint Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) in May 2016. Following input from the SAG, the methodology was further developed to include specific disease scenarios, a series of sub-criteria to explore different factors that could affect the relevance of a disease to R&D Blueprint objectives.

The results were analysed using the AHP MCDA approach detailed in the prioritization methodology (more details in the peer-reviewed methodology and application (Mehand et al., 2018) ). WHO Blueprint secretariat presented an overview of the results which was discussed and reviewed by the Committee. Results of a sensitivity analysis to measure the robustness of the ranking are presented in Appendix B. The Committee examined overall scores for each of the diseases (Fig. 3) . These results could not be used directly to rank the short-listed diseases in a distinct order, as the discordance intervals (corresponding to the standard deviation calculated through error propagation) overlapped for many of them. However, the results demonstrated a sub-set of four low-scoring diseases (chikungunya, Rift Valley fever, non-polio enteroviruses, and Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome). Participants agreed that additional consideration was warranted as to whether the subset of low-scoring diseases should be prioritized under the Blueprint.",

Disease X may also be a known pathogen that has changed its epidemiological characteristics, for example by increasing its transmissibility or severity.
