In this vast landmass, respiratory infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children and adults [2] . In a typical tropical clinic, 20-40% of outpatients have respiratory complaints, and 20-30% of inpatients have lung disease (Table 1-1) [2] .",

In addition, individuals who come in contact with birds or animals may develop zoonoses such as tularemia, psittacosis, Q fever and leptospirosis [4] . In the tropics, indoor air pollution caused by biomass fuels used for cooking and heating of the homes and huts is an important cause of obstructive lung disease and chronic lung infections [5] .",

In some areas, particularly Papua New Guinea, South Africa and Spain, resistance of the pneumococcus to penicillin is common. For children with non-severe pneumonia, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or oral amoxicillin for 5 days [9] . In severe pneumonia in hospitalized children, the policy in low-income countries is to first give benzylpenicillin injections, changing the therapy to oral amoxicillin when the child responds. In very severe pneumonia, in children in low-income settings, chloramphenicol may be given first with benzylpenicillin and gentamicin in combination as an alternative [10, 11] .",

After droplet inhalation of the virus, there was an incubation period of 2-7 days, then fever, cough, malaise and headache occurred. Pulmonary inflammation was characterized by desquamation of pneumocytes, hyaline membrane formation and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The chest x-ray showed diffuse opacities or consolidation, especially in the lower lung fields. Recovery could be slow and some patients developed fibrosis. Mortality was 10-20%, with the elderly and those with cardiovascular problems being especially at risk.",

Laboratory tests that can guide the management of a pleural effusion are macroscopic appearance(Table 1-6), pleural fluid cell counts, biochemistry, pH and Gram stain. A simple test is centrifugation of the fluid. If an originally \"milky\" fluid clears with that process, it is presumably an empyema. If not, it is either a chylothorax (pleural fluid triglycerides >110 mg/dL, e.g. lymphoma, post thoracic surgery) or a cholesterol effusion (pleural fluid cholesterol >200 mg/dL).Transudative pleural effusions occur in heart failure, liver disease, endomyocardial fibrosis, hypoproteinemia/malnutrition and hypothyroidism.
