Reverse genetics system for the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus. J. Virol. 75, 12359-12369]. The method has subsequently been used to generate a recombinant IBV expressing a chimaeric S gene [Casais, R., Dove, B., Cavanagh, D., Britton, P., 2003. Recombinant avian infectious bronchitis virus expressing a heterologous spike gene demonstrates that the spike protein is a determinant of cell tropism. J. Virol. 77, 9084-9089]. Use of vaccinia virus as a vector for the full-length cDNA of the IBV genome has the advantage that modifications can be made to the IBV cDNA using homologous recombination, a method frequently used to insert and delete sequences from the vaccinia virus genome. We describe the use of homologous recombination as a method for modifying the Beaudette full-length cDNA, within the vaccinia virus genome, without the requirement for in vitro assembly of the IBV cDNA. To demonstrate the feasibility of the method we exchanged the ectodomain of the Beaudette spike gene for the corresponding region from IBV M41 and generated two recombinant infectious bronchitis viruses (rIBVs) expressing the chimaeric S protein, validating the method as an alternative way for generating rIBVs.",

            "text": "The assembly of full-length cDNAs corresponding to the coronavirus genomes was hampered due to some cDNAs, derived from regions of the replicase gene, being unstable in bacteria. However, despite this, three methods have been described for the assembly of full-length cDNAs of the genomic RNA of coronaviruses. The first method involved the assembly of a TGEV full-length cDNA in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), immediately downstream of a viral RNA polymerase II promoter. Transfection of the BAC DNA into susceptible cells resulted in synthesis of infectious RNA and the recovery of infectious virus (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2000) . The second system involved the in vitro assembly of full-length cDNAs using a series of contiguous cDNAs with engineered specific restriction sites. Bacteriophage T7-RNA polymerase-derived RNA transcripts of the cDNAs were used to generate infectious virus (Yount et al., 2000 (Yount et al., , 2002 (Yount et al., , 2003 . The third strategy involved the in vitro assembly of contiguous cDNAs followed by direct cloning into the genome of vaccinia virus. Infectious RNA transcripts were synthesised in vitro from the vaccinia virus DNA, using bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase, and transfected into cells resulting in the recovery of infectious virus . In an alternative strategy infectious IBV was recovered following transfection of restricted vaccinia virus DNA, containing the IBV full-length cDNA, into cells infected with recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase (Casais et al., 2001) . The vaccinia virus system has the advantage that the coronavirus full-length cDNA is present in a non-bacterial system and offers the opportunity of modifying the coronavirus cDNA by homologous recombination. Falkner and Moss (1990) devised a general method for modifying the vaccinia virus genome, involving insertions, deletions and specific mutations, termed transient dominant selection (TDS). The method relies on a two-step procedure. In the first step, a complete plasmid sequence is introduced into the vaccinia virus genome as a result of a single cross-over event involving homologous recombination between vaccinia virus sequences in the plasmid DNA and virus genome. The plasmid sequence contains the sequence being modified and a dominant selectable marker gene, Escherichia coli guanine Xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (Ecogpt) (Mulligan and Berg, 1981) , under the control of the vaccinia virus P 7.5K promoter. Recombinant viruses expressing the gpt gene are selected for resistance against mycophenolic acid (MPA) in the presence of xanthine and hypoxanthine. In the second step, the MPA-resistant viruses are grown in the absence of selection, resulting in loss of the Ecogpt gene due to a single homologous recombination event between duplicated sequences, present as a result of the integration of the plasmid DNA. The second step results in one of two recombination events; return to the original input virus sequence, without modification to the virus or introduction of the modified sequences into the vaccinia virus genome. Both events should occur with equivalent efficiencies if the homology regions are of equal length.",

The rIBV expressed an S gene in which the ectodomain of the protein was derived from a different strain of IBV. Having demonstrated that it was possible to produce a rIBV expressing a modified S gene we decided to investigate an alternative, quicker and simpler, procedure for modifying the full-length IBV cDNA within the vaccinia virus genome for the production of rIBVs containing the chimaeric S gene. In this paper, we describe the generation of two homologous rIBVs, rIBV-M41S-A and rIBV-M41S-B, in which the ectodomain sequence of the Beaudette S gene in vaccinia virus vNotI-IBV FL (Casais et al., 2001) was exchanged with the corresponding region from the M41 strain of IBV using the TDS method. Our results demonstrated that rIBVs can be generated following direct modification of the full-length IBV cDNA by homologous recombination within the vaccinia virus genome.",

The transfected cells (P 0 cells) were incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 16 h after which the transfection medium was replaced with fresh maintenance medium (P\u00e9nzes et al., 1994) . At 2.5 days post transfection, the culture medium, potentially containing rIBV (V 1 ), was removed, centrifuged for 3 min at 2500 rpm, filtered through a 0.22 m filter, to remove any rFPV-T7 , and used for serial passage on CK cells. Two independently rescued The recombination vector is based on a GPT expressing plasmid, pGPTNEB193, in which a segment of the IBV genome, corresponding to the IBV S gene and flanking sequences of approximately equal length, was introduced. The majority of the S gene was then removed, leaving only the transmembrane and C-terminal domains within the recombination vector, pGPT-IBV-S. The flanking regions were included to allow homologous recombination events to occur between the IBV sequences in pGPT-IBV-S and the corresponding sequences in the IBV full-length cDNA in the vaccinia virus (vNotI-IBV FL ) genome. The flanking regions were of approximate equal length to allow unbiased homologous recombination events. The various IBV gene sequences and relevant restriction sites are indicated; S represents the spike glycoprotein gene, 3a, 3b, 3c (E) represent the IBV gene 3 products; M represents the integral membrane protein; 5a, 5b represent the IBV gene 5 products; N represents the nucleocapsid protein; 3 UTR represents the IBV 3 untranslated region; H\u2426R represents the hepatitis delta ribozyme sequence; T7 term represents the T7 termination sequence; Ecogpt represents the E. coli GPT gene and VV P 7.5 represents the vaccinia virus early/late P 7.5 promoter. Both types of recombination events have an equal chance of occurring. The various IBV genes are as described in the legend to Fig. 1 Rep represents the end of the IBV replicase gene, S indicates that the signal sequence and ectodomain are deleted with the transmembrane and C-terminal domain sequences remaining in the partial S gene sequence in the IBV cDNA; 3 and 5 represent the IBV gene 3 and 5 sequences, respectively. rIBVs, rIBV-M41S-A and rIBV-M41S-B, were obtained and characterised.",

However, to replace the 3.4 kb Beau-CK S sequence with the corresponding M41-CK S sequence an intermediary recombinant vaccinia virus, vNotI-IBV-S FL , containing the Beau-CK cDNA with the S gene deleted had to be produced. This was to avoid re-combination events occurring within the S gene sequence if attempts were made to directly exchange the two sequences.

The chimaeric S gene consisted of the signal sequence, ectodomain and transmembrane regions derived from IBV M41-CK and the cytoplasmic tail domain from Beau-CK. The transmembrane domains are identical between the two sequences but the cytoplasmic tail domain of the M41-CK S protein is truncated by nine amino acids when compared to the Beau-CK S protein. We had previously indicated that we retained the Beau-CK cytoplasmic tail domain because this region of the S protein has been demonstrated to interact with other virus proteins (Godeke et al., 2000) . The chimaeric S gene sequence, from pFRAG-3-M41S (Casais et al., 2003) , was used to replace the corresponding Beau-CK S gene sequence in pGPT-IBV-StuI-BamHI, resulting in pGPT-M41S (Fig. 2) .

Our results affirmed that the TDS method is a suitable method for modifying the IBV full-length cDNA within the vaccinia virus genome, resulting in isogenic variants that differ only in the introduced sequences. This method for generating rIBVs will be useful for generating isogenic rIBVs for determining the effect of the modifications on gene functions. We also demonstrated that an intermediary form of the IBV cDNA in the vaccinia virus, containing a deleted region of the IBV genome, can be used for swapping large regions of the IBV genome avoiding the generation of chimaeric sequences.",

The signal sequence, ectodomain and transmembrane domain of the M41-CK S gene sequence was used to replace the corresponding Beau-CK sequence in pGPT-IBV-StuI-BamHI. The transmembrane domains from the two viruses are identical, therefore the chimaeric S gene has essentially the signal sequence and ectodomain sequences derived from M41-CK and transmembrane and C-terminal domain sequences from Beau-CK in pGPT-M41S. The flanking regions of the chimaeric S gene were as described in the legend forFig. 1and were present to allow integration of the chimaeric S gene by homologous recombination events into the IBV cDNA lacking an S gene sequence in vNotI-IBV-S FL .

The diagram represents a potential recombination event between the replicase sequence in one of the flanking regions in pGPT-IBV-S and the corresponding region in the IBV cDNA in vNotI-IBV FL . The single step recombination event results in the integration of the complete plasmid sequence into the IBV cDNA in the vaccinia virus genome. Resultant recombinant vaccinia viruses are selected in the presence of MPA due to incorporation of the GPT gene under the control of a vaccinia virus promoter. The integrated sequences result in tandem repeat sequences within the IBV cDNA. Such resultant vaccinia viruses are relatively unstable and are only able to maintain the duplicate sequences in the presence of MPA. In the absence of MPA one of the duplicated sequences is lost as a result of spontaneous recombination events. In the absence of MPA, two types of potential recombination events, I and II, are possible resulting in the loss of the GPT gene. Recombination event (I) results in retention of the S gene sequence, such recombinant vaccinia viruses have the same sequence as the original input vaccinia virus; (II) results in the loss of most of the S gene sequence, the desired modification.",
