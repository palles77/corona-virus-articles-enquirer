In the recent scramble for Ebola virus readiness, health care providers adopted drastic measures to protect patients and staff. Using hindsight, what lessons can be extrapolated for other infectious and communicable diseases within the context of emergency nursing? Moreover, what are ways in which emergency departments might prepare for future pandemics?",
