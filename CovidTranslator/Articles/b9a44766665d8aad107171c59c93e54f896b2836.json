These differences may be more pronounced in disease processes in which there is inconsistent implementation of published guidelines. Bronchiolitis is a commonly diagnosed respiratory illness in the PED with wide variation in practice patterns, which are not always consistent with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines. Given this practice variation and known racial and ethnic disparities among other common pediatric illnesses, determining if language barriers contribute to variations in the diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis in the PED could potentially help to understand if disparities exist and guide improvement efforts. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine if a family's preferred language of Spanish versus English was associated with differences in diagnostic testing and management of bronchiolitis in the PED. We hypothesized that there would be a higher frequency of diagnostic tests, medications, treatment orders, and admission rates for Spanish-speaking families compared to English-speaking families who presented to the PED with a child with bronchiolitis.",

In order to request an interpreter, the Emergency Services Representative or triage nurse places a request in the patient's chart for the specific language needed in order to use the interpreter services within the hospital. The hospital provides an in-person Spanish interpreter 20 hours every day. If an in-person interpreter is unavailable, providers are able to request a video or phone interpreter.

In a study conducted by Payne and Puumala, no racial or ethnic disparities were found among pediatric patients who presented with head injuries, for which a head injury algorithm was used. 5 Even though differences were not observed, there is insufficient evidence to show that evidence-based guidelines actually reduce disparities among children. Adherence to guidelines may not produce any change (if all patients benefit irrespective of racial, ethnic, or language background) or may even worsen disparities, as shown in some adult studies. 30 It is important to note that the differences found in our study were only among diagnostic testing, which would only be mediated by a diagnosis-based guideline. However, there is some rationale that focusing on the development and implementation of comprehensive equityfocused guidelines may be a way to facilitate the reduction of disparities among diagnostic testing, interventions, and health outcomes. Welch et al discussed the necessity of explicitly considering health equity in the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology, and developed an approach for how guideline panels can assess the influence of equity factors on the direction and strength of recommendations. 31\u221233 For instance, openly asking questions about biases and researching the evidence regarding which populations are potentially disadvantaged in relation to a clinical problem and why (because of race, gender, culture, language, etc.) can help directly inform clinical practice guidelines. Although other frameworks (such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines used in the United Kingdom) explicitly identify certain patient characteristics that must be considered in guideline development, only recently has health equity been included in the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework as a consideration for clinical recommendations from an",

Although we used a standardized method to identify patients with the diagnosis code of bronchiolitis, the diagnosis is determined by physicians' documentation and expertise in making their diagnosis. Furthermore, diagnostic codes may be changed after the chart is reviewed for billing, which may not always be in accord with the physician diagnosis codes. Second, we determined the independent variables (by using preferred language and interpreter requested) from the documented fields in the EMR. Although we attempted to remove potential sources of bias by excluding the encounters with discordant language data, we still could not verify that even if an interpreter was requested, that they were used for the entire visit, when they were used, and to what extent. Third, we developed covariates a priori, and other covariates, such as the diagnosis of reactive airway disease, were difficult to control for given inconsistencies in documentation. These diagnoses may have prompted physicians to use bronchodilators more often. However, we did not see differences in bronchodilator use among the 2 groups of patients, and the history of reactive airway disease should not affect the need for CBCs, blood cultures, and chest x-rays, which were the only significant differences in this study. Last, this was a single-center study and may not be generalizable to other institutions. However, because our study did include 2 emergency departments within a large catchment area, results may be similar at other large children's hospitals.",

Further research on how clinical practice guidelines as well as equity-focused guidelines can impact disparities in diagnostic testing within the PED is warranted.",
