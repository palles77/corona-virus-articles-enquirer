Robustness of this method is verified by numerical experiments with both artificial and stock returns series. Results show that the proposed W-MFSMXA method not only keep the multifractal structure unchanged, but contains more significant information of series compared to the previous MFSMXA method. Furthermore, analytic formulas of the binomial multifractal model are generated for W-MFSMXA. Theoretical analysis and finite-size effect test demonstrate that W-MFSMXA slightly outperforms MFSMXA for relatively shorter series. We further generate the scaling exponent ratio to describe the relation of two methods, whose profile is found approximating a centrosymmetric hyperbola. Cross-multifractality is found in returns series but then destroyed after being shuffled as a consequence of the removed long memory in separate series.",

Such scaling laws provide a description of the data and the complex system by fractal scaling exponents. Nevertheless, many records do not present a simple monofractal scaling behavior and different parts of the series require different scaling exponents. In even more complicated cases, such different scaling behavior can be observed for many interwoven fractal subsets of the time series, where a multitude of scaling exponents is required for a full characterization of the scaling behavior in the same range of time scales and a multifractal analysis must be applied. In order to observe the fractals and multifractals in time series, algorithms have been developed one by another [1, 2] .",

            "text": "Since detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) has been proposed by Peng et al. [3] to detect the long-range power-law correlations in DNA sequences, it has been successfully applied to diverse fields [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Then Podobnik and Stanley [12] generalized DFA and introduced the detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA) for two non-stationary time series, which has aroused increasing interest in analysis of long-range cross-correlation and multifractality [1, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Specifically, the analysis is based on the bivariate Hurst exponent h xy estimation, which is related to an asymptotic power-law decay of the cross-correlation function. A power-law cross-correlated process has the cross-correlation function C xy (k) \u221d k 2hxy\u22122 for k \u2192 +\u221e and the cross-power spectrum | f xy (s)| \u221d s 1\u22122hxy for s \u2192 0+. h xy = 0.5 is characteristic for the absence of power-law cross-correlation, while processes with h xy > 0.5 are cross-persistent and h xy < 0.5 indicates the anti-persistent cross-correlation of the data [2, 12, 25] . Basis of these, the cross-correlation coefficient (\u03c3 DCCA ) was introduced with the objective of quantifying the level of cross-correlation between nonstationary time series [26] [27] [28] . In the DFA-DCCA-\u03c3 DCCA line, Kristoufek [29] has recently introduced the DFA framework to estimate regression parameters at different scales and under potential non-stationarity and power-law correlations. Alternatively, the detrending moving-average (DMA) method can also be used for fractal or multifractal analysis, found that the backward multifractal detrending moving average (MFDMA) algorithm outperforms the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) [30] [31] [32] [33] . As an alternative to \u03c3 DCCA , based on the detrending moving-average cross-correlation analysis (DMCA), the DMCA coefficient \u03c1 DMCA was proposed as well [17, 34] . To investigate the multifractal features of two cross-correlated non-stationary series, several methods have been proposed for this purpose. Zhou [14] further proposed multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MFDCCA) as a generation of DCCA. Jiang and Zhou [35] developed a class of MFDCCA algorithms based on DMA, called MFXDMA whose performances are comparative to MFDCCA's. Moreover, a new method for the detection of long-range crosscorrelations and multifractality based on scaling of qth order covariances, multifractal height cross-correlation analysis (MF-HXA), was proposed by Kristoufek [18] . Meanwhile, statistical moments function or partition function has been widely applied to analyze the multifractal features of financial time series [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . Based on this approach, Jiang and Zhou [38] investigated the multifractal characteristics in intraday minutely data for four stock market indexes within individual trading days and found the so-called multifractality is merely an illusion. Dissimilarly, when they performed the partition function approach on the 1-min volatility of two indexes and 1139 stocks in the Chinese stock markets, multifractal nature is significant [39] . Extending that from one dimension to two dimensions, Wang et al. [40] introduced the multifractal cross-correlation analysis based on statistical moments (MFSMXA) as an application of the joint multifractal measures [41] , finding that MFSMXA has comparative performance with MFXDMA and sometimes perform slightly better than MFDCCA. By far, multifractal analysis has been employed successfully in various provinces, such as human nature [42] [43] [44] , financial time series [45] [46] [47] , river flow [48] and traffic signals [49] , etc.",

Performances are also compared with these in MFSMXA. Application to financial time series is presented in Section 4. At last, Section 5 gives the conclusions and appendix exhibits charts of the finite-size effect for the binomial multifractal model.",

Thus, the importance of long-range cross-correlations and multifractality resides in the scaling of covariances between |\u03bc X (v, s)| q/2 and |\u03bc Y (v, s)| q/2 regarding varying s and q. As a consequence, there are two types of cross-multifractality: (i) crossmultifractality caused by multifractality of the separate series, and (ii) cross-multifractality by scaling of covariances between |\u03bc X (v, s)| q/2 and |\u03bc Y (v, s)| q/2 .",

And to a certain extent, the measure \u03bc is kind of frequency or probability. To improve that, we propose a modification of current MFSMXA, called weighted MFSMXA method based on Shannon entropy (W-MFSMXA), to take into account that not all measurements contribute equally when constructing the statistical moments function and to save as much information as possible carried by the series. Specifically, the motivation behind this is to weight proportionally segments with distinct measurements \u03bc but the same final F XY (q, s). [57] to be the weight factor makes sure that \u03bc with higher value is assigned more weights. Furthermore, Shannon entropy as a complexity (or regularity or orderliness) measure quantifies the information richness of \u03bc in series and this novel information-based approach has been successfully employed in literary authorship disputes [50] , SARS coronavirus [51] , biologic signals [52] and financial time series analysis [53] .",

[59] . To our knowledge, no analytic expression has been generated for this model. Series analyzed here are with a given preparation as in Section 3.1, then we apply MFSMXA and W-MFSMXA algorithms to the NBVP series to examine the validity of the assumption about delay in Section 3.2. Results are shown in Fig. 5 . Singularity widths in this case are \u03bb = 0.5242 and \u03bb (\u03c9) = 0.5294, which are insignificantly deviated. Same as the previous part, except for the position and several discrepant points, the multifractal structure of the series remains unchanged. \u03c4 (\u03c9) xy (q) and \u03c4 xy (q) after multiplying correspond a(q) are nearly coincident and the hyperbolic characteristics of a(q) with respect to q is more obvious. In other words, the \u03c4 xy (q) measurements in both method are apparently different for relatively smaller q but more accordant for higher q while never equal. Proposition about the delay is further verified. It can be seen in Fig. 5d , the scaling of covariances \u03b7(q) \u2212 1 is higher than the average of scaling of separate processes for negative moment orders q, the deviations are nevertheless not significant for higher positive q. In contrast, \u03b7(q) \u2212 1 basically coincides with \u03c4 xy (q), implying that the cross-multifractality of series is mainly caused by the scaling of covariances between |\u03bc X (v, s)| q/2 and |\u03bc Y (v, s)| q/2 as the construction of the NBVP mixes the long memory of the separate processes.",

Fig. 7a depicts the statistical moments function F xy (q, s) as a function of scale s in log-log plots for q from \u22123 to 3 with the step-length of 1 by W-MFSMXA and MFSMXA methods. Excellent power laws are also observed for both algorithms. Same as before, F (\u03c9) xy (q, s) in W-MFSMXA is more similar to F xy (q + 1, s) in MFSMXA, which is conformed when plotting the scaling exponent function \u03c4 (q) versus the moment order q in Fig. 7b . The scaling exponent ratio a(q) is plotted in Fig. 7c and clearly approximates a hyperbola. The nonlinearity of \u03c4 (q) demonstrates the existence of but weak multifractality in the absolute logarithmic daily returns series. Besides, in Fig. 7d , \u03c4 xy (q) are practically consisitent with the averages of \u03c4 xx (q) and \u03c4 yy (q) while the scaling of covariances \u03b7(q) \u2212 1 is obviously the lowest, indicating that the cross-multifractality in series is mainly dominated by the multifractality of separate series.",

To test the robustness of this new procedure and compare to the heuristic MFSMXA, we first employed three types of artificial time series: the two-exponent ARFIMA processes with monofractal feature, the binomial multifractal model (BMF) and the NBVP time series, which have been proved the existence of multifractal properties. However, unlike BMF, crossmultifractality in NBVP is mainly caused by the scaling of covariances rather than the correlated separate processes. Long-range cross-correlation analysis of the two-component ARFIMA stochastic processes by W-MFSMXA uncovered the fractal nature in these power-law cross-correlated series. Results of multifractal analyses show that the statistical moments function versus scale s for q in W-MFSMXA is more similar to that in MFSMXA for q + 1. The scaling exponents obtained by two methods are almost parallel to each other. What's more, differences of the corresponding singularity widths captured by two algorithms do not deviate significantly from zero. Thus, it is rational to believe that the multifractal structure of series has not been changed by the weighting procedure without considering their positions. Basis of these, we generated analytic formulas of the BMF model for W-MFSMXA. Theoretical analysis and finite-size effect test verified the good performances of W-MFSMXA. Specifically, numerical results are well in line with the theoretical values and W-MFSMXA outperforms MFSMXA for analysis of series with relatively shorter length. Meanwhile, we generated the scaling exponent ratio a(q), whose profile is approximately a centrosymmetric hyperbola, to describe the relation between W-MFSMXA and MFSMXA. Scaling exponent estimators in both methods are more consistent for relatively higher orders q while never equal, indicating the delay in MFSMXA compared to W-MFSMXA.",

In all cases, time series with length N = 2 nmax are analyzed, where n max = {10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16}. The scales s are given by s = round[logspace(log 10 (T min ), log 10 (T max ), 30)], where T min = 100, T max = N/4 and round(X) means rounding the elements of X to the nearest integers. For series with different parameters p x = {0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.4} in Eq. (21), results of the evaluation of (cross-) multifractality are presented in appendix. Significantly, for analyses of separate series in MFSMA and W-MFSMA (see Figs. 9 and 10), two \u03c4 (q) estimators, namely \u03c4 xx (q) and \u03c4 (\u03c9) xx (q), have the same performances: (1) For sequences with different length sizes, numerical results of \u03c4 xx (q) and \u03c4 (\u03c9) xx (q) coincide well with the corresponding theoretical values respectively except for n max = 10; (2) For p x = 0.4 in Figs. 9e and 10 e, all series perform well especially in W-MFSMA; (3) Generally, n max = 11 \u2212 13 are acceptable while n max = 14 \u2212 16 are more reliable, which is accordant with the results of MFSMXA procedure between two time series in",

While when p x = 0.1, p y = 0.25 and p x = 0.1, p y = 0.3 (see Figs. 12b and c), n max = 11 \u2212 13 are the best. In general, on the basis of investigations in this section, performances of W-MFSMA are as good as MFSMA's and n max = 11 \u2212 16 are suggested for use in MFSM(X)A or W-MFSM(X)A. Nevertheless, W-MFSMXA outperforms MFSMXA for series with relatively shorter length, i.e., n max = 11 \u2212 13. At this point, W-MFSM(X)A is comparable to MFSM(X)A.",
