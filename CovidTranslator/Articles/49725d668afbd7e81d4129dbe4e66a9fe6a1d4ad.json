Our analysis divides poxvirus proteins into categories based on their relative degree of similarity to two different taxonomic subsets of proteins such as all eukaryote vs. all virus (except poxvirus) proteins. As an example, this allows us to identify, based on high similarity to only eukaryote proteins, poxvirus proteins that may have been obtained by horizontal transfer from their hosts. Although this method alone does not definitively prove horizontal gene transfer, it allows us to provide an assessment of the possibility of horizontal gene transfer for every poxvirus protein. Potential candidates can then be individually studied in more detail during subsequent investigation.",

Both subfamilies are further divided into genera, groups of viral species with genetic and antigenic similarity to one another. Chordopoxviruses are categorized into 9 genera: Avipoxvirus, Capripoxvirus, Cervidpoxvirus, Leporipoxvirus, Molluscipoxvirus, Orthopoxvirus, Parapoxvirus, Suipoxvirus, and Yatapoxvirus. Entomopoxviruses are categorized into the genera Alphaentomopoxvirus, Betaentomopoxvirus, and Gammaentomopoxvirus.

Unlike most viruses, poxvirus virions do not rely on particular cell surface receptors, but are capable of binding and penetrating the outer membrane of nearly any cell type. Virion cores are released into the cytoplasm where they immediately synthesize early mRNAs that are translated into growth factors, cell signaling and immune defense molecules, enzymes, and other factors necessary for DNA replication and intermediate transcription. Uncoating of the core next allows the DNA genome to be replicated to form concatemeric molecules along with the transcription of intermediate genes that when translated, provide late transcription factors. Subsequent transcription and translation of the late genes produces virion structural proteins, enzymes, and early transcription factors for packaging into virions (Moss, 2001) . During virion formation, the concatemeric DNA genomes are resolved into individual genomes, packaged into the core membranes, and mature within the cytoplasm to form infectious mature virions (MV). These are subsequently wrapped in modified Golgi membranes and transported to the periphery of the cell via attached actin filaments. Fusion of the wrapped virions with the plasma membrane results in release of enveloped virus (EV) (Condit et al., 2006) .",

Their resulting genetic stability, together with their high levels of host specificity have led in part to the hypothesis that many DNA viruses cospeciate with their hosts (DeFilippis and Villarreal, 2001) . Intricate relationships with their hosts are evidenced by the many immunological and cellular factors these viruses have obtained through host gene capture via recombination between viral and host DNA. Such acquisition of new coding information by poxviruses may contribute to the ability of the virus to manipulate the host immune response and other cellular machinery to provide a selective advantage for virus replication.",

Understanding species crossing events of both types is essential to understanding the threats poxviruses pose today.

Recombination may be an important source of genetic variation among viruses, where it is often associated with rapid evolutionary divergence, due to the potential of providing a selective advantage much more quickly than through the accumulation of point mutations. Recombination has been detected in both DNA and RNA viruses including species of the families Caulimoviridae, Flaviviridae, Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae, Picornaviridae, Potyviridae, Poxviridae, Polyomaviridae, Retroviridae, the genus Tobamovirus, and bacteriophages in the order Caudovirales (DeFilippis and Villarreal, 2001) .

Many of the apparently host-derived genes fall into one of two well-defined categories of gene function: immunomodulatory genes and genes involved in nucleic acid metabolism. Viral proteins that are very similar to host genes are documented to interfere with a variety of host immune defense mechanisms including antigen display, cytokines and their receptors, cytoplasmic signaling resulting from immune activation, and genes involved in resistance of cells to oxidative stress and apoptosis (Hughes and Friedman, 2005; Shackelton and Holmes, 2004) . Many DNA viruses encode genes involved in nucleic acid metabolism, with which they redirect the host nucleotide precursor pool to viral DNA synthesis (Iyer et al., 2006) . These enzymes are often clearly similar to host enzymes, and are often very highly conserved, probably due to functional restraints on structure and biochemical properties. There are many additional, possibly hostderived genes, whose functions have not yet been fully explored, but based at least on similarity to other proteins, seem to manipulate various intracellular processes to facilitate steps in the viral life cycle. Examples of these are genes involved in signaling pathways, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, vesicle transport, and protein-protein interactions (Afonso et al., 2000; Geserick et al., 2004; Laidlaw et al., 1998; Werden and McFadden, 2008) .",

These include phylogenetic inference, compositional features such as codon and nucleotide bias, and patterns of presence and absence of genes within genomes. A well accepted and widely used method to detect horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is demonstration of phylogenetic clustering of the gene of interest with taxa unrelated to the current genome in which the gene is found, to the exclusion of taxa more closely related to the current genome. This method provides information about the potential donor and recipient organisms, but its potential caveats include limited phylogenetic samples, undetected presence of paralogs, and unequal rates of evolution between lineages (Katz, 2002) . Compositional features that may be used to detect recently horizontally acquired genes include nucleotide composition, oligonucleotide frequencies, and codon usage (Koonin and Wolf, 2008) , but these methods work only for very recent HGT because the anomalous signatures of such genes decay rapidly due to continued evolution of the host genome (Katz, 2002; Koonin and Wolf, 2008; Monier et al., 2007) , and these methods do not give information about the donor lineage (Katz, 2002) . Presence of a gene within only a related subset of a taxonomic group is a possible indicator of HGT if apparent orthologs of the gene are present in unrelated taxa.",

Overall, the resulting plots show that chordopoxvirus proteins tend to exhibit greater similarity to eukaryotic proteins than to bacterial or viral proteins, suggesting that many poxvirus proteins may share a common evolutionary origin with proteins of their eukaryotic hosts. The plots in Fig. 1 distinguish between chordopoxvirus and entomopoxvirus subsets of poxvirus proteins. Although entomopoxviruses share several of the host-like genes present in chordopoxviruses, entomopoxvirus proteins do not show the same general skew towards greater similarity with eukaryotic proteins in comparison to other viral proteins.

Although there are three classes of RNR, only class 1, subclass A is found in eukaryote-infecting viruses. RNR class 1 is made up of large (RNR1) and small (RNR2) subunits, with two of each subunit required to associate into a heterotetramer to form a functioning enzyme (Stubbe, 1990) . Both subunits are very well conserved in all major taxonomic groups in which RNR type I appears: eukaryotes, eubacteria, bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses. The large subunit of RNR (RNR1) is present in orthopoxviruses and suipoxviruses, while the small subunit of RNR (RNR2) is present in most chordopoxviruses. For both subunits, the percent identities between queries and highest scoring hits are between 80% and 90% percent similarity, with such high levels of sequence conservation likely due to the stringent structural requirements the enzyme must maintain in order to function (Torrents et al., 2002) . Although many chordopoxvirus species encode only the small subunit, it is probably functioning in association with host-encoded RNR1, based on the finding that even RNR subunits from vastly different species can associate to form heterotetramers (Hamann et al., 1998) .",

All these enzymes catalyze steps in pyrimidine metabolism, in particular converting cellular pools of RNA components into nucleotides for synthesis of DNA. Also high on the diagonal are DNA polymerase, alpha and beta subunits of RNA polymerase, and DNA photolyase, a DNA repair enzyme well conserved in all branches of life, but notably missing from placental mammals. The poxvirus proteins in this category are widely, some even ubiquitously, distributed among poxviruses, and have most similar viral proteins outside poxviruses in a wide variety of double stranded DNA viruses, including members of the postulated NCLDV group of viruses such as the phycodnaviruses, iridoviruses and mimiviruses, as well as in viruses outside this group, such as adenoviruses and herpesviruses.

This category also includes semaphorins and c-type lectin-like proteins whose functions in poxviruses are unknown, but similar proteins in other organisms have roles in immunological pathways. Poxvirus encoded apoptosis-inhibiting proteins and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase protect infected cells against programmed cell death. These virally encoded proteins find highest scores among eukaryotes which seem likely to be hosts or closely related to hosts of the respective viruses, which make the viral proteins seem likely to be the products of indepen-dent horizontal gene transfer events from hosts. Although actual assessments of such potential gene transfers may be provided only by further analysis of each gene group, notably by phylogenetic inference, the locations of the points on these plots and the identities of the highest scoring proteins on each axis suggest candidates for study, and provide clues as to which proteins may yield the most interesting results. A good candidate for further study is IL-10, presumably of eukaryotic origin, but with several apparently homologous proteins among poxviruses and herpesviruses. A phylogenetic reconstruction of several viral and host IL-10 sequences is provided in Fig. 2B . Analysis of the phylogenetic relationship between these proteins suggests the possibility of several independent IL-10 HGT events between hosts and infecting viruses. Three HGT events are suggested into different lineages of herpesviruses, and two separate HGT events are suggested for poxviruses, with one each into the capripoxvirus and parapoxvirus lineages. It is notable that for many of these HGT events, the most closely related eukaryote IL-10 protein to a specific virus IL-10 protein is between the particular host species and the virus that infects that host.",

However, the proteins that lie to the eukaryote side of the diagonal are predominantly non-centrally located and appear in a very limited number of species. Presence of these genes in only one or a few genera or species strongly suggests the genes were acquired by the cowpox virus lineage subsequent to its divergence (or the divergence of the most recent orthopoxvirus ancestor) from the other poxvirus genera. High scores with eukaryotic proteins may also indicate relatively recent transfer of the genes from eukaryotes, and/or strong selection for sequence identity with host proteins. The sparsely populated area near the virus axis has only proteins widely conserved among poxviruses, and these are almost exclusively centrally located, with the one exception being the poxvirus B22R protein. B22R is a surface glycoprotein that is conserved in every chordopoxvirus genus, and as mentioned above, has Table 2 . Genes are labeled by their restriction fragment name and are colored according to the highest blastp bitscore obtained by the encoded poxvirus protein when searched against the respective taxonomy database. Bitscores are normalized by dividing by the highest possible bitscore the query protein could achieve, i.e. the bitscore it receives when compared to itself. Therefore the highest possible score for each comparison is 1. The map demonstrates the higher levels of similarity poxvirus proteins have to eukaryote proteins in comparison to virus proteins outside the poxvirus family. In addition, it is apparent that with only a few exceptions, poxvirus proteins with high levels of sequence identity to proteins of other organisms tend to lie towards the edges of the linear genome.

This analysis was designed to detect overall trends in gene similarity and to detect individual genes that may be of interest due to anomalous characteristics with regard to such levels of similarity. Each individual protein may then be further investigated with regard to its function, distribution in poxviruses and other organisms, and via phylogenetic analysis, to determine its most likely evolutionary history. Proteins identified as interesting candidates for follow-up research by this method may be further studied using more traditional phylogenetic methods as illustrated by our initial phylogenetic analyses of proteins in Fig. 2 . Overall trends in sequence similarity of different subsets of poxvirus proteins, as well as information about individual proteins implicated by our analysis may contribute valuable information about the evolution of poxviruses and the mechanisms of host pathogenesis.",

Although ento-mopoxviruses also contain host-like genes, both with and without homologs in chordopoxviruses, entomopoxvirus proteins do not show the same general skew towards similarity to eukaryotic proteins. However, entomopoxviruses encode quite a few proteins with notably greater similarity to proteins of other viruses than to bacterial or eukaryotic proteins. The relatively small sampling of insect proteins available in GenBank could partly account for the low scores of these proteins to the eukaryote database, with insects being represented by 799,971 proteins and 210 complete genomes, compared to a vertebrate collection of 1,787,682 proteins and 1559 complete genomes. However, with only 3 exceptions, all chordopoxvirus proteins which achieve similarly high scores to proteins of other viruses are proteins with sequences universally conserved throughout nature, such as ribonucleotide reductase, DNA photolyase and RNA polymerase. For viruses of both the entomopoxvirus and chordopoxvirus subfamilies, the most similar virus proteins outside the poxvirus family are found both among members of the postulated NCLDV group of viruses and among non-NCLDV members, with viruses of the families Baculoviridae, Herpesviridae and Iridoviridae most represented.",

These results also provide an overview of the functional significance of many of the genes poxviruses share with their hosts, and expose which host genes are captured uniquely by poxviruses and which are captured by other virus families as well. Information yielded by more comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of poxvirus genes to genes of their hosts and other viruses, will illustrate details of molecular mechanisms of poxvirus adaptation and survival throughout the history of the virus family, giving a richer picture of the evolution of this once devastating and still dangerous group of viral pathogens.",
