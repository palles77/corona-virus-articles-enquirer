Both vaccine development and drug discovery have been hampered by the inherent instability of the virus itself. Drug discovery efforts have had limited success due, at least in part, to the lack of an antiviral assay robust enough for high-throughput screening. Instability of the purified virus has long been recognized as a problem in RSV research and has been a major hurdle to producing a virus-based screening assay. Using frozen RSV-infected cells as the source of infectious material, we have overcome the problem of virus instability and validated a cell-based high-throughput screening assay to screen for inhibitors of RSV-induced cytopathic effect. The assay was validated with 1,280 compounds identified as potentially active against RSV (Long strain) in a virus-based screen. To date over 300,000 compounds have been screened over several months with minimal variability in cell or virus controls. Long-term assay stability studies are still in progress.",

            "text": "INTRODUCTION R espiratory syncytial virus (RSV), from the family Paramyxoviridae, is most often associated with bronchitis and pneumonia among infants and children under 1 year of age, but the elderly or those with compromised immune systems, cardiac disease, or pulmonary disease are also at risk of severe lower respiratory disease. 1 RSV infections cost more than $650 million annually due to hospitalizations and indirect medical costs. 2 Available chemotherapeutic agents are limited to Ribavirin 3 and the prophylactic humanized monoclonal antibody (Synagis \u00d2 from MedImmune), which are used in hospitalized high-risk pediatric patients. 4 Virus instability has been well documented since the early days of RSV research 5 and is still problematic in both vaccine development and drug discovery today. Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent disease and the live attenuated vaccines that have been developed have a limited shelf life due to virus instability, making production and distribution of these vaccines difficult. 6 A vaccine and therapeutic agents are critically needed for RSV, but drug discovery has been hampered by the lack of a robust antiviral assay for high-throughput screening (HTS). Mason et al. used a biochemical assay and identified a novel scaffold, from a small molecule screen, that inhibits the RSV viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. 7 To identify broad classes of compounds effective against multiple targets, a cell-based antiviral assay would be highly desirable. To our knowledge, there have been no reported HTS screening efforts for identification of RSV inhibitors using cytopathic effect (CPE) as an endpoint. This is due in part to the instability of the virus and the inconsistent results produced during an HTS campaign.",

Retroviruses have also been found to be unstable as purified virus stocks. As a result of this, researchers in this field have used infected cells to perpetuate the viral infection in cell culture 13 and have frozen infected cells (FICs), using standard cell cryopreservation methodology, for long-term storage of infectious material. These cells remain infectious for years, if stored in liquid nitrogen, and can be used to re-establish infection by addition to uninfected cells in culture. In HTS, frozen cells are routinely used as the source of cells for screening. 14 Cells are thawed, diluted, and plated in assay plates for many cell-based assays and this helps minimize the variability often observed in cell-based assays due to passage number and other variables. These two strategies have been combined to create a robust and reproducible RSV assay for HTS by using RSV FICs as the source of infectious material.",

Activity in this case is defined as the number of RSV-positive wells and was plotted against the FIC dilution on a log scale. FICs were quantitated by diluting the FIC stock to the plating density of 80,000 cells/mL, and then log dilutions were done with uninfected cells at the same density.

There were no overt indications based on assay performance that would allow prediction of a pending crash and at the end of the stable period, the virus stock would lose infectivity on a tube by tube basis rather than as a uniform drop in titer in all the aliquots.

Assay plates were prepared from a single compound dilution plate on the same day, using the same uninfected cells and the same medium to directly compare assay performance and minimize variables. Single replicate 10 point dose-response was done for each compound in both assay formats. Curves in (A) were derived from the FIC-based assay and curves in (B) were from the virus assay. EC 50 values and standard deviations were calculated based on % Inhibition of CPE at 10 concentrations, n \u00bc 1, for each substance using the four parameter Levenburg-Marquardt algorithm with the minimum and maximum parameters locked at 0 and 100, respectively. vials 3 and 6 still show infectivity, vial 7 is highly variable indicating a drop in titer, and vials 1, 2, 4, and 5 show minimal virusinduced CPE. The impact of this behavior on an HTS screening run would mean either a successful run with control values similar to historical controls for the assay or a complete failure, with virtually no virus infection. When considering the investments in time and resources for a single HTS run, this behavior presented an unacceptable financial risk and work on the FIC-based assay was pursued.",

To determine when to harvest infected cells for cryopreservation, cells were harvested at 6, 18, and 40 h postinfection and evaluated by TCID 50 . Cells harvested at 6 h were not very infectious and produced low TCID 50 s; cells harvested at 18 h produced TCID 50 s of 3.5 and cells harvested at 40 h had reduced viability and syncytia were observed before harvest. For assay validation and the screening campaign, 50 vials of FICs were prepared by harvesting at the 18 h time point. This will be sufficient stock to screen 1.5 million compounds. Table 1 shows the TCID 50 values of the FICs in weeks postfreezing. The calculated TCID 50 values have been consistent over a 42-week time period. The virus-based assay, which we were attempting to duplicate with the FICs, developed CPE sufficient to reduce cell viability by 95% in 6 days, The infectious dose of FICs required to produce this same progression was determined empirically. The low initial infectious dose of FICs allows for multiple rounds of virus replication and infection over the course of the assay. It would be expected that the source of the initial infection would have minimal impact on the classes of compounds identified in the screen. To evaluate this further, compounds were used to compare results from both assay formats.",

We used the RSV-FIC methodology to screen over 300,000 compounds from the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository as part of a National Institute of Health Molecular Libraries Probe Production Center Network project (Severson, article in preparation). Assay performance was consistent over the course of the screen which included 995 plates screened over a 6week period and an additional 90 plates screened in dose-response 7 weeks later using the same lot of FICs. Z \u00a2 values for the screen were between 0.5 and 0.9 with an average of 0.8. Hit rate calculated as 50% or higher inhibition was 0.2% in the FIC screen which was comparable to the hit rate of 0.3% observed in the 110K virus-based screen. Absolute values for cell and virus controls varied slightly depending on ambient conditions such as room temperature (since CTG is an enzyme-based read out) but virus controls were consistently between 2% and 5% viable for the entire screening campaign. TCID 50 values for the FICs were also evaluated each week during the primary screen and periodically afterward. No significant change in infectivity was observed over a 42-week time period. The FIC methodology has been validated and used successfully for an HTS campaign, adding a novel assay development strategy for labile viruses.",

For viruses that are very stable at \u00c0808C, such as influenza, this is unnecessary, but for viruses that are not stable as purified stocks, this is a strategy to develop an assay that is robust enough for HTS. By developing the method of using FICs in place of infectious virus, we circumvented virus instability and were able to complete the screening campaign without encountering any problems with infectivity of the stocks. However, long-term stability studies are needed to determine what the stability limits of FICs are in this application. These studies are currently in progress with TCID 50 values being determined periodically. To further streamline the assay for HTS, we are evaluating the use of frozen uninfected cells in place of cells in culture. The use of all frozen cells decouples cell culture from screening and simplifies the logistics of running an HTS screen. Cost and variability associated with cell passage and cell density should both be reduced by using all frozen cells.",
