A present study was carried out to look for the source of contamination (patient itself) and examine the route of contaminant transfer in the hospital. This article provides recommendation for future work to improve the yield and save the energy consumption simultaneously. The risk of airborne infection can be minimized in hospital wards by using a high air change rate. The Local mean age of air will decrease with an increasing flow rate because the source must be considered to be constant. The location of the outlet openings plays an important role for the transfer of the contaminant particle in the hospital.",

[1] have presented that there is no direct relationship to quantify the transient influence of different boundary conditions including contaminant in supply air, contaminant source and initial condition on indoor contaminant distribution. The proposed expression can explicitly and quantitatively reflect the impact of supply air, contaminant source and initial condition on the contaminant distribution indoors. An experimental measurement is employed to validate the reliability of the analytical expression. It is shown that the results from the expression agree well with experimental measurement. Kim et al. [2] have presented a study, carried out to look for the source of contamination and examined the route of contaminant transfer in the mini-environment applied in liquid crystal display (LCD) process clean room of Korea. It was revealed that the critical contamination source was the stocker and the contaminants were transferred by the airflow pattern. The velocity distribution was improved and the particle concentration was reduced in the target minienvironment. King et al. [3] have used aerobiology test room arranged in three different layouts-an empty room, a single-bed and a two-bed hospital room. Comparison with CFD simulations using Lagrangian particle tracking demonstrates that a realistic prediction of spatial deposition is feasible, and that a Reynolds Stress (RSM) turbulence model yields significantly better results than the k-\u025b RNG turbulence model used in most indoor air simulations. Results for all layouts demonstrate that small particle bio aerosols are deposited throughout a room with no clear correlation between relative surface concentration and distance from the source.",

[4] have analyzed the dispersion of the exhaled contaminants by humans in indoor environments; with special attention to the exhalation jet and its interaction with the indoor airflow pattern in both mixing and displacement ventilation conditions. The objectives of this study are to increase knowledge regarding the exhaled contaminant distribution under different environmental conditions and to validate whether a steady boundary condition of the exhalation flow may simulate human breathing in an effective and accurate way. The results show a very good agreement of the numerical results obtained for test and the experimental data. The fact confirms the use of numerical simulation as a powerful tool to predict the contaminant distribution exhaled by a human. Hang et al. [5] have investigated how the walking motion of health care worker (HCW) influences gaseous dispersion in a six bed isolation room with nine downward supplies and six ceiling-level or floor-level exhausts. The flow near and behind HCW is easily affected by the motion of HCW. The flow disturbance induced by HCW walking with swinging arms and legs is a mixing process. HCW motion indeed affects airborne transmission, but its effect is less important than ventilation design. No matter with or without HCW motion, the ceiling-level exhausts perform much better in controlling airborne transmission than the floor-level exhausts with the same air change rate (12.9 ACH). Smaller air change rate of 6 ACH experiences higher concentration and more gaseous spread than 12.9 ACH. The realistic human walking which is the simplified motion of a rectangular block produces stronger flow disturbance. Finally surface heating of HCW produces a stronger thermal body plume and enhances turbulence near HCW, thus slightly strengthens airborne transmission.",

The sealing efficiency is estimated for different situations, with the ACD installed inside, outside or on both sides of the door. The buoyancy induced airflow field when the ACD is turned off and the \"opened door\" was taken as a reference to assess the sealing efficiency. According to Goncalvesa, downward blowing air curtains present better sealing efficiency (over 70%) compared to horizontal jet air curtains (about 55%). The direct air recirculation provides a better sealing efficiency (over 80%). Bhamjee et al. [7] have investigated that the temperature rise and heat gain are higher in the natural flow case than in the forced flow cases. The models have been experimentally validated in terms of velocity field, flow field and temperature rise. The velocity field was measured using Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and the overall flow field was captured using smoke for flow visualization.",

A textile partition between the beds, which is typical in a hospital ward, is used for protection of the patients in some of the experiments. Three different layouts of return openings are tested for one layout with one opening at the ceiling, another with four openings at the wall opposite to the inlet diffuser, and one with a high location of these four openings. The downward recalculating flow is on average parallel with the partition, and in most cases the partition does not decrease cross-infection.
