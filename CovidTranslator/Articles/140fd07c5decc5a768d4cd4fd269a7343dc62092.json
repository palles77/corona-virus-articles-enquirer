The virus has since been named the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS-CoV cases have been reported in several countries around the world in travelers from the Middle East. The illness has a high mortality rate. Limited human-to-human transmission has occurred including transmission to health care workers. The source of the virus remains unclear, but camels are a possible source. Two unrelated imported cases of MERS-CoV have been reported in the United States. Neither a vaccine nor effective therapy against the virus is available. International cooperation and information sharing will be key to understanding and ending the MERS-CoV outbreak. \u00aa Abbreviations and Acronyms: CDC = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; HCP = health care personnel; ICU = intensive care unit; IHR = International Health Regulations; MERS = Middle East respiratory syndrome; SARS = severe acute respiratory syndrome; WHO = World Health Organization Correspondence: Address to Priya Sampathkumar, MD, Division of Infectious Diseases, Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 (sampathkumar.priya@mayo.edu).",

M iddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a newly described viral disease that causes severe respiratory illness and is associated with high mortality. The disease is caused by a coronavirus that has been named MERS-CoV. The spread of human cases of MERS internationally, and the sharp increase in cases reported from Saudi Arabia since May 2014, are global public health concerns. As health care facilities worldwide are assessing their readiness to deal with MERS-CoV, this summary is aimed at providing perspective and practical advice for preparation.",

            "text": "The first case of MERS-CoV infection was described in a 60-year-old Saudi businessman who was previously healthy except for obesity (body mass index of 35). 1 He was hospitalized in June 2012 with fever, cough, shortness of breath, and progressive respiratory and renal failure. He died on hospital day 11. The causative agent was identified as a novel betacoronavirus in September 2012. Subsequently, the virus, named MERS-CoV, has been linked to clusters of respiratory illnesses in Jordan dating back to March 2012. All reported cases of MERS-CoV infection to date have been directly or indirectly linked to travel or residence in 7 countries in the Arabian Peninsula: Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Jordan, Kuwait, and Yemen. Cases in travelers from this region have been imported to Europe (France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom), Africa (Tunisia, Egypt, and Algeria), Asia (Malaysia and the Philippines), and the United States. In June, Lebanon and Iran reported cases related to travel to Saudi Arabia. As of June 9, 2014, 699 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV have officially been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), including 209 deaths. An additional 113 cases were reported by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health on June 3; these cases have not yet been verified by the WHO. 2 Since April 2014, the rate at which cases are being reported has risen rapidly, and more than half the reported cases have occurred since April 2014 ( Figure) . It is not clear that these official numbers represent the true picture because there is concern that there is considerable underreporting of cases, particularly from Saudi Arabia.",

Studies suggest that the virus has been circulating in bats for a number of years. 4, 5 Strains of MERS-CoV have been isolated from dromedary (single-humped) camels in Egypt, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Genetic sequencing shows close links between the human and camel viruses and supports the premise that camels are a likely source of infection in humans. The recent surge in cases corresponds with similar but smaller spikes in April and May in 2012 and 2013 and may be related to the camel breeding season. However, many cases report no contact at all with camels, suggesting that there may be another environmental source. ",

If verified, newly reported cases from Saudi Arabia that resulted in death may push the case fatality rate closer to 40%. 14 Initial signs and symptoms are nonspecific and include fever, chills, headache, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, and myalgia. Other symptoms can include sore throat, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Atypical presentations including mild respiratory illness without fever and diarrheal illness preceding development of pneumonia have been reported. The median time from illness onset to hospitalization is approximately 4 days. Laboratory findings include lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. Radiographic findings may include unilateral or bilateral patchy lung infiltrates, consolidation, and pleural effusions. Renal failure has been reported frequently. 15 MERS-CoV can be detected in respiratory tract secretions, with tracheal secretions and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens providing a higher yield for detection than nasopharyngeal swabs. 16 The virus has also been detected in feces, serum, and urine. The duration of MERS-CoV shedding is unknown at this time.",

Chest imaging showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. He required supplemental oxygen but did not require mechanical ventilation. By May 9, the patient had recovered fully.",

As SARS began to spread globally, this reluctance was replaced by unprecedented cooperation among international health authorities that led to containment of the outbreak in 4 months. One of the positive outcomes of the SARS outbreak was the adoption of the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR). 34 Worldwide, 197 countries have adopted the IHR, which provides a new framework for the coordination of the management of events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern. The WHO hopes that when fully implemented, the IHR will improve the capacity of all countries to detect, assess, notify, and respond to public health threats. Thus, the MERS-CoV outbreak is a test of global public health preparedness and cooperation. ",
