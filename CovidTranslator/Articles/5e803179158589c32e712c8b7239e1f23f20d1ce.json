            "text": "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) constitute the body's principal source of type I interferon (IFN) and are comparatively abundant in the liver. Among various cytokines implicated in liver ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury, type I IFNs have been described recently as playing an essential role in its pathogenesis. Moreover, type I IFNs have been shown to up-regulate hepatocyte expression of IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), a key transcription factor that regulates apoptosis and induces liver damage after I/R. Our aim was to ascertain the capacity of IFN-\u03b1 released by liver pDC to induce liver damage through hepatic IRF-1 up-regulation after I/R injury. Our findings show that liver pDC mature and produce IFN-\u03b1 in response to liver I/R. Liver pDC isolated after I/R induced elevated levels of IRF-1 production by hepatocytes compared with liver pDC isolated from sham-operated mice. Notably, hepatic IRF-1 expression was reduced significantly by neutralizing IFN-\u03b1. In vivo, IFN-\u03b1 neutralization protected the liver from I/R injury by reducing hepatocyte apoptosis. This was associated with impaired expression of IRF-1 and pro-apoptotic molecules such as Fas ligand, its receptor (Fas) and death receptor 5 which are regulated by IRF-1. Furthermore, pDC-depleted mice failed to up-regulate hepatic IFN-\u03b1 and displayed less liver injury associated with reduced levels of hepatic IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and hepatocyte apoptosis after I/R compared with controls. Conclusion: these data support the hypothesis that IFN-\u03b1 derived from liver pDC plays a key role in the pathogenesis of liver I/R injury by enhancing apoptosis as a consequence of induction of hepatocyte IRF-1 expression.",

I/R injury is unavoidable during transplant surgery, and adversely affects patient and graft outcomes. 1, 2 In a recent large study of living-and deceased-donor liver transplant patients, extended cold ischemic time was associated with elevated rates of early organ failure and acute cellular rejection. 3 Moreover, because of the greater susceptibility of extended criteria liver grafts to ischemic insult, I/R injury exacerbates the donor organ shortage problem. No specific treatment is available to prevent or reduce hepatic I/R injury and current management is based on supportive care. Thus, extensive efforts are warranted to better understand the mechanisms that underlie liver I/R injury.",

            "text": "Type I interferons (IFNs; IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) are multifunctional cytokines, that activate or modulate immune responses. 4 Type I IFNs bind to type 1 IFN receptors (IFNAR) and activate Jak1 and Tyk2 that, in turn, phosphorylate signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 and STAT2 and promote the formation of the IFN-stimulated gene factor (ISGF) 3 complex. The ISGF3 complex binds to nuclear IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) and induces transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) 4, 5 that encode factors responsible for antiviral, antiproliferative and immunoregulatory responses. 6 Due to their critical role in innate immunity, type I IFNs are used as therapeutic agents in viral hepatitis, leukemia, renal cell carcinoma and multiple sclerosis. 7 On the other hand, type I IFNs can play pathogenic roles in some autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). 4 Neutralization of IFN-\u03b1 is a potential therapeutic approach in type I IFN-related diseases and therapeutic effects of IFN-\u03b1 neutralizing antibody (Ab) have been reported in mouse models of HIV encephalitis and septic shock. 8, 9 Recently, the safety of an anti-IFN-\u03b1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (MEDI-545) has been confirmed in a chronic psoriasis phase I trial. 10 Type I IFNs are regarded as critical factors in both warm and cold liver I/R injury. Thus, in mice, IFNAR KO livers are protected from damage, 11, 12 suggesting that IFN-\u03b1 neutralization might be a therapeutic option for inhibition of liver I/R injury.",

Overexpression of IRF-1 promotes apoptosis by up-regulation of Fas ligand (CD95L), while IRF-1-deficient hepatocytes are resistant to apoptosis. 15, 16 IRF-1 is known to play a key role in liver I/R injury since high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) released from dying/dead cells up-regulates IRF-1 in hepatocytes through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 ligation and promotes liver injury. 17 Furthermore, IRF-1-deficient livers exhibit less I/R injury correlated with the reduced apoptosis due to diminished expression of death ligands, including Fas ligand and death receptor (DR)5. 18, 19 Although type I IFNs are produced by almost all cells, IFN-\u03b1 is produced mainly by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) while IFN-\u03b2 is produced by fibroblasts, synoviocytes and stromal cells. 20 pDC are an unconventional subset of bone marrow-derived DCs and produce large amounts of IFN-\u03b1 following TLR7 and TLR9 ligation. 21, 22 Although rare cells, pDC are recognized as important players in protecting the host from viral infection by producing IFN-\u03b1. By contrast, pDC that sense self DNA through TLR9 and produce high amounts of IFN-\u03b1, drive autoimmunity and exacerbate SLE and psoriasis. 23 In addition to IFN-\u03b1, pDC produce pro-(IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) following TLR ligation. 24 Thus, like conventional DCs, pDCs play key roles in innate and adaptive immunity in the liver. 25 While conventional DC have been implicated in the regulation of liver I/R injury. 26, 27 to date, no data are available concerning the role of pDC in hepatic I/R injury.",

Our data show that pDC are activated and produced IFN-\u03b1 after liver I/R and that IFN-\u03b1 promotes IRF-1 expression by hepatocytes in vitro. In vivo, IFN-\u03b1 neutralization significantly reduces liver I/R-induced damage, with associated reduction in IRF-1, proinflammatory cytokine (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) and death receptor (Fas and DR5) expression in the liver. Moreover, depletion of pDC in vivo reduces hepatic IFN-\u03b1 and protects the liver from I/R injury. ",

These data suggest that the protective effect of IFN-\u03b1 neutralization in liver I/R injury is due to reduced apoptosis as the result of less IFN-\u03b1-mediated induction of IRF-1 and consequently less induction of both death receptors and death ligands that are regulated by IRF-1.",

Taken together, these data suggest that liver pDC are an important source of IFN-\u03b1 during liver I/R injury and play a key role in the pathogenesis of I/R injury.",

IRF-2 is structurally similar to IRF-1 and competes with IRF-1 as an antagonist. Klune et al have reported that overexpression of IRF-2 protects the liver from I/R injury by an IRF-1-dependent mechanism. 34 IRF-3 is another transcription factor that is involved in type-I IFN and other pro-inflammatory cytokine production after TLR stimulation. Interestingly, IRF-3-deficient mice exhibit severe warm liver injury due to greater IL-17 induction and enhanced neutrophil infiltration. 35 Type I IFNs have immunostimulatory capacity and can activate immune cells, including T cells, natural killer (NK) cells and DCs. 36 IFN-\u03b1-primed DCs produce enhanced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, and promote T helper type-1 cell responses. 37 In this study, we have shown that IFN-\u03b1 neutralization decreases key pro-inflammatory cytokines,-IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, after liver I/R injury. This finding is consistent with recent observations using IFNAR KO mice. 11, 12 Although we did not identify the sources of these pro-inflammatory cytokines, our data suggest that IFN-\u03b1 is involved in promotion of pro-inflammatory cytokine production during liver I/R injury.",

Similarly to our results, pDC have been shown to play a pathological role in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice, with pDC depletion reducing disease activity. 50 Type I IFNs derived from pDC are important for inhibition of viral replication and clearance, 21 but type I IFNs are also pathogenic in the early phase of EAE 50 and in our liver warm I/R injury model.

The data provide significant new insight into mechanisms that promote liver I/R injury via a pDC-IFN-\u03b1-IRF-1 pathway and support the therapeutic potential of IFN-\u03b1 neutralization for amelioration of liver I/R injury. Hepatic I/R injury stimulates phenotypic maturation and IFN-\u03b1 production by liver interstitial pDC. B6 mice underwent I/R injury as described in the Materials and Methods. After 6 hours reperfusion, liver pDC were isolated by immunomagnetic bead sorting and phenotypic and functional analyses performed.

(A) Liver pDCs, isolated from sham-operated or I/R injury B6 mice were incubated for 18 hours to accumulate IFN-\u03b1 in the culture supernatant. Thereafter, pDC and their accompanying supernatants were transferred to normal mouse hepatocytes and cultured for 3 hours, with or without neutralizing anti-IFN-\u03b1 mAb (5\u00b5g/ml) added at the start of culture. IRF-1 production was assessed by RT-PCR. Mouse hepatocytes cultured with or without IFN-\u03b1 were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Overall analysis of n=3 independent experiments. *, p<0.01. (B) Hepatocytes from WT or IRF-1 KO were cultured with or without IFN-\u03b1 (1000 U/ml) for 4 hr. Hepatocyte viability was determined by MTT assay. *, p<0.05 In vivo neutralization of IFN-\u03b1 reduces liver I/R injury, associated with reduced IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 gene expression. B6 mice were injected iv with neutralizing IFN-\u03b1 mAb (50 \u00b5g/ mouse; iv) or isotype control Ig, 30 minutes before being submitted to I/R injury. The protective effect of IFN-\u03b1 neutralization is associated with down-regulation of IRF-1 gene transcription and death molecule expression. B6 (n=4 per group) mice were injected iv with IFN-\u03b1 neutralizing mAb (50 \u00b5g/mouse; iv) or isotype control Ig, 30 minutes before being submitted to I/R injury. After 6 hours reperfusion, liver tissue was harvested.

In vivo pDC depletion protects the liver from I/R injury. B6 mice were injected for 3 consecutive days with anti-mPDCA-1 pure-functional grade mAb (500\u00b5g, i.p.) or isotype control Ig. (A) To assess the depleting efficiency of the Ab, freshly-isolated liver nonparenchymal cells were stained for CD11c, B220, Siglec-H and mPDCA-1 and analyzed by flow cytometry. CD11c int B220 + Siglec-H + mPDCA-1 + cells (pDC) were gated and their frequency calculated. Data are representative of 3 mice per group. (B-F) Twenty-four hours after the final mAb injection, the vasculature supplying the left and median lobes of the liver Schematic representation of the proposed role of pDC and type I IFN in hepatic I/R. Vascular occlusion involving 70% of the liver for 1 hour followed by 6 hours reperfusion induces hepatocyte necrosis and release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as the TLR9 ligand self-DNA. Self-DNA engages TLR9 in hepatic pDC that, in turn, are activated and release comparatively large amounts of type I IFN (IFN-\u03b1). Thereafter, IFN-\u03b1 engages its receptor (IFNAR) on hepatocytes and induces transcription of IRF-1, a key pro-inflammatory factor involved in the pathogenesis of I/R injury, able to perpetuate liver damage and release new DAMPs. Blocking of type I IFN using neutralizing anti-IFN-\u03b1 mAb down-regulates hepatocyte IRF-1 with a concomitant reduction in hepatocyte apoptosis (decreased levels of Fas and DR5) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in reduced liver damage. +++, elevated expression.",
