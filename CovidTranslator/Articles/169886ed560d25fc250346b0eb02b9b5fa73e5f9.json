            "text": "COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has recently affected over 300,000 people and killed more than 10,000. The manner in which the key immune cell subsets change and their states during the course of COVID-19 remain unclear. Here, we applied single-cell technology to comprehensively characterize transcriptional changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the recovery stage of COVID-19. Compared with healthy controls, in patients in the early recovery stage (ERS) of COVID-19, T cells decreased remarkably, whereas monocytes increased. A detailed analysis of the monocytes revealed that there was an increased ratio of classical CD14 ++ monocytes with high inflammatory gene expression as well as a greater abundance of CD14 ++ IL1B + monocytes in the ERS. CD4 + and CD8 + T cells decreased significantly and expressed high levels of inflammatory genes in the ERS. Among the B cells, the plasma cells increased remarkably, whereas the na\u00efve B cells decreased. Our study identified several novel B cell-receptor (BCR) changes, such as IGHV3-23 and IGHV3-7, and confirmed isotypes (IGHV3-15, IGHV3-30, and IGKV3-11) previously used for virus vaccine development. The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23-IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity. Furthermore, integrated analysis predicted that IL-1\u03b2 and M-CSF may be novel candidate target genes for inflammatory storm and that TNFSF13, IL-18, IL-2 and IL-4 may be beneficial for the recovery of COVID-19 patients. Our study provides the first evidence of an inflammatory immune signature in the ERS, suggesting that COVID-19 patients are still vulnerable after hospital discharge. Our identification of novel BCR signaling may lead to the development of vaccines and antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19.",

With regard to COVID-19, recent studies also found decreases in lymphocyte numbers and increases in serum inflammatory cytokine levels in peripheral blood [5, 14] . However, the manner in which key immune cell subsets change and their states during COVID-19 have remained largely unclear.

T cell-monocyte interaction may enhance immune response and be exclusive to COVID-19 patients. (Fig. 7A, B) . Furthermore, we found that monocytes highly expressed the poliovirus receptor, which serves as a cellular receptor for poliovirus in the first step of poliovirus replication and induction of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. From the B cell-monocyte and B cell-T cell interactions, we found that B cells could secrete a large number of IL-6, LTA, and LTB, which are combined with IL-6R, LTAR, and LTBR expressed in monocytes, and a large amount of IL-6 was applied to T cells to promote the secretion of IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, and other inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Thus, a cascade signature of inflammatory monocytes with high expression of IL-6 and their progeny were formed in the peak incidence of ERS COVID-19 patients (Fig. 7C) . These activated immune cells may enter the circulation in the lung and other organs in large numbers and play an immune-damaging role. In LRS COVID-19 patients, DC ligands were predicted to interact with B and T cell receptors involved in cell proliferation and the production of antibodies. We discovered that the peripheral blood of LRS patients contains a diversity of antibodies ;   we  found  that  IL18-IL18RAP,  TNFSF13-TNFRSF13B,  TNFSF13-TNFRSF17,   TNFSF13B-TNFRSF17, TNFSF13B-TNFRSF13B , and TNFSF13B-TNFRSF13C were highly expressed in our analysis of DC-B cell interaction (Fig. 7D) . Thus, we speculate that DCs produce IL-18, TNFSF13, and TNFSF13B to promote the proliferation of B cells and then secrete many antibodies into the blood in ERS. From the DC-T and T cell-B cell interactions, we discovered that DCs produce not only IL-18 but also IL-7 to promote the proliferation of T cells; moreover, T cells produce IL-2 (to promote the proliferation of B cells) and antibodies (Fig. 7D) . Thus, cell-to-cell interactions help us to understand why COVID-19 patients manifested high rates of monocytes and low rates of lymphocytes and why the proportion of lymphocytes gradually increased in the peripheral blood of recovering patients.",

This has been similarly observed in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and influenza infections [12, 14] . In viral infection, it is generally accepted that host immune responses determine both protection against viral infections and the pathogenesis of respiratory injury [18, 19] . A coordinated response in innate and adaptive immune cells working in concert may lead to the rapid control of the virus, whereas a failed immune response might lead to viral spreading, cytokine storm, and a high mortality rate [20] . Despite belonging to same group of viruses, recent studies have highlighted differences between COVID-19, SARS, and MERS, such as the speed of transmission, treatment scheme, and mortality rate. Moreover, this difference may also exist in the key immune players and the underlying molecular mechanisms related to these diseases. The lack of knowledge regarding the immune impact of COVID-19 has now become a critical issue in view of its rapid spread and the shortage of specific therapy [21] . Using single-cell sequencing, we profiled the complexity of immune populations in the blood and analyzed 70,858 cells from 10 patients. We identified a hyper-inflammatory response in ERS patients, which may explain why some patients fell sick after being discharged, and suggest that the current criteria for hospital discharge should be re-evaluated. In addition, we identified unique signatures of myeloid, NKT, and B cells and pinpointed the changes in the epitopes of TCR and BCR.",

Their therapeutic effect is unclear [30] , although robust antibody responses could be induced [31] . In COVID-19 infection, although several lines of evidence have consistently indicated a decline in lymphocyte counts, the distinct immune characteristics at single-cell resolution are unclear. Our scRNA-seq analysis showed that, compared with the HCs, ERS patients have a lower ratio of T and NK cells, and these patients' T cells express higher levels of inflammatory genes, such as JUN, FOS, JUNB, and KLF6. In addition, high-throughput TCR sequencing identified expanded T cell clones in ERS patients. In LRS patients, the immunophenotype was different. In particular, LRS patients would have an increase in T and NK cells, with a lower expression of inflammatory genes. We also performed a detailed analysis of B cells in patients and identified a higher population of plasma cells than that in the HCs. We found that BCR contained highly expanded clones, indicating their SARS-CoV-2 specificity. Importantly, we found several loci unique to COVID-19 infection. The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23-IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity. Notably, numerous studies have reported biased usage of VDJ genes related to virus-specific antibodies. For example, IGHV3-30 and IGKV3-11 have been involved in encoding primary antibodies to neutralize human cytomegalovirus [32, 33] . In addition, IGHV3-30 and IGHV3-21 have been utilized to isolate influenza virus antibodies and used for the production of virus vaccines [34, 35] . Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that antibodies combining the IGHV3-15/IGLV1-40 segments had superior neutralizing activities against the Zaire Ebola virus [36] .",
