            "text": "Background: Social media allows for instant access to, and dissemination of, information around the globe. Access to social media in low-and middle-income countries has increased exponentially in recent years due to technological advances. Despite this growth, the use of social media in low-and middle-income countries is less well-researched than in high-income countries. Objective: To identify, explore and summarize the current state of the literature on the use of social media for health in low-and middle-income countries. Methods: A scoping review was conducted on literature available to December 2017. Six databases were searched, and grey literature was identified through the Google and Google Scholar search engines. Literature was considered for inclusion if it (1) was published in English, (2) was conducted in or in relation to a low or middleincome country, (3) reported on as least one type of social media or social media use generally for health purposes, and (4) reported on at least one aspect of human health. Content analysis was performed to identify themes. Results: Forty articles met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-one were research articles, and nine were review/discussion/descriptive and evaluative reports. Since 2010, when the first article was published, most of the literature has focused on Asian (n = 15) and African (n = 12) countries. Twitter (n = 11) and Facebook (n = 10) were the most frequently discussed individual social media platforms. Four themes were identified: (1) use for health education and influence (sub-themes were health behaviour and health education); (2) use within infectious disease and outbreak situations; (3) use within natural disaster, terrorism, crisis and emergency response situations; and (4) producers and consumers of social media for health (sub-themes were misinformation, organizational challenges, users' expectations, and challenges of unique sub-populations). Most studies addressed more than one theme. Conclusion: Social media has the ability to facilitate disease surveillance, mass communication, health education, knowledge translation, and collaboration amongst health providers in low-and middle-income countries. Misinformation or poorly communicated information can contribute to negative health behaviours and adverse health outcomes amongst consumers, as well as hysteria and chaos. Organizations using social media should provide accurate and readable information. Promotion of credible social media sites by governments, health care professionals and researchers, as well as education on the appropriate use of social media, could help to lessen the effect of misinformation. This is a nascent body of literature and future research should investigate the relative effectiveness of various platforms for different users, other potential uses, and pursue a broader geographical focus.",

Facebook, which was established in 2004, is the most popular of these; in 2015, 72% of online adults globally were users [6] and in 2017 it was estimated that Facebook has approximately 1.8 billion active users [7] . These websites are often called social media platforms and are used to create, debate, modify and share material [8] . Social media allows for instant access to and dissemination of information both locally and around the world, and users have the opportunity to play an active part in the reporting and dissemination of online material [9] . The high prevalence of use emphasizes the potential for social media activities to impact people's knowledge, attitudes and behaviours in both high and low resource settings [10] .",

The rapid improvement in Internet access within low-income settings has been enhanced through 'leap frogging,' which refers to the adoption of a more advanced technology while skipping the preceding stage of technology [12] . Leap frogging is made possible through the lower cost and greater efficiency of the new technology [13] as seen in Africa where cellular networks are expanding rapidly, having skipped installation of hard-wired infrastructures, thus facilitating wireless access to the Internet [14] . In 2015, one third of people across developing nations reported owning a smartphone [11] , a fast-growing trend expected to accelerate in coming years.",

Social media has given healthcare professionals effective tools for communicating with populations for the purpose of health promotion and patient education, and has been credited with enabling more effective and responsive healthcare services [16, 17] . For example, patients in the United Kingdom have reported that using services supported by social media has resulted in improved communication and shared-decision making, more positive interactions, and a shift towards treating the whole patient rather than just the disease [17] .",

Social media was defined as a collection of Internet-based applications that allow the creation and exchange of user-produced context [22] . We excluded literature that focused only on the use of mobile phones and cellular capabilities (i.e., such as telephoning or texting, and not devices that were used for social media access), and articles that focused only on mHealth, which is defined as medical or public health practice supported by mobile devices [23] . Literature that focused on low-income or low-resourced settings within high-income countries, and literature where social media was used solely as a method for data collection with no discussion of its use were also excluded. engines yielding 529 individual articles for possible inclusion in this scoping review. After removing duplicate citations (n = 17), titles and abstracts were reviewed for appropriateness resulting in the removal of another 420 articles. Five citations were added from hand searching the 'Journal of Health Informatics in Developing Countries', the reference lists of key articles, and other literature identified through the \"Similar Articles\" algorithm in the PubMed database (https://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/books/NBK3827/#pubmedhelp.Computation_of_Similar_ Articl). The full text of each of the remaining 97 articles was then screened by EH using the inclusion/exclusion criteria, yielding a final sample of 40 articles. Published, peer-reviewed literature constituted 39 of the articles, while one was grey literature. Fig. 1 outlines the systematic process followed for identifying and selecting literature.",

A majority of the literature was research-based. Publication dates ranged from 2010 to 2017, with the majority of literature published from 2014 to 2017. Infectious disease surveillance, global emergency response, and the use of social media for health communication were the most common contexts of papers that were published during this period of increased activity in 2014-2017. Four themes were identified: use for health education and influence; use within infectious disease and outbreak situations; use within natural disaster, terrorism, crisis and emergency response situations; and producers and consumers of social media for health. The geographical focus of the literature was centered on Asian and African nations, with little to no emphasis on other lowand middle-income areas of the world.

However, there were very few articles published until 2014 (see Table 3 ). The use of social media for health behaviour change campaigns emerged in the literature in 2011 [49] , and has been a regular topic since then. The use of mixed methods research, and the incorporation of theory or other conceptual frameworks was first seen in 2013, the year growth on the topic started to build (Amrita and Biswas, 2013; [30, 54] . This highlights a certain level of maturation of the state of literature even at this early point, three years since the beginning of publication on the topic.

Theme 3: natural disaster, terrorism, crisis and emergency response A small number of the papers (n = 3, 8%) addressed the use of social media within such contexts as natural disasters, terrorism, and the response to crisis and emergency situations. These papers reported on positive and negative patterns of social media use in global emergency and crisis situations. Specific lessons that were highlighted in the literature included what was learned about crisis management practices from the Nigerian famine of the 1960\u2032s [25] , the effectiveness of the Twitter response of organizations following the 2010 Haitian earthquake [32] , and how social media was used during the 2013 Westgate Mall terror attack in Kenya [50] . Natural disaster, terrorism, crisis and emergency response was separated from infectious disease and outbreak situations described above in order to highlight more specifically the different conditions and environments in which social media use has been shown to be influential. Although literature on natural disasters, terrorism and emergency response occurred less frequently than those of infectious disease and outbreaks, it is important to recognize the distinction between the two while highlighting the similarities in process and platform use (i.e., Twitter remains the most common platform method used in the literature of both threads).",

Ten articles (25%) highlighted the unique barriers faced by young and marginalized consumers of social media in LMICs. Populations such as LGBT individuals [27, 31, 36, 48] , adolescents [43, 45, 52] , and people with diagnoses such as tuberculosis [17] and HIV [27, 33, 37] were highlighted in these papers. Health educational campaigns, and support and empowerment for treatment adherence and prevention were the more specific uses of social media within these groups; all of the articles described healthcare providers' use of social media to reach these populations, as well as barriers that inhibit this process such as privacy issues, and access to offline supports where needed. Four of these citations were published between 2010 and 2014, indicating that vulnerable groups were one of the first populations targeted through the use of social media within the context of LMICs. [15, 26, 39, 53] another study sampled a stakeholder group of healthcare professionals in Nigeria for their perceptions of the use of social media for healthcare delivery in their state [54] . Two other papers focused more specifically on consumers accessing information for specific health issues: palliative care [59] , and an anti-tobacco campaign [34] . All seven articles highlighted consumers' expectations of accuracy in social media messaging as well as feasibility issues related to the implementation and sustainability of social media use for health-related purposes (i.e., the maintenance of health-related information requires consistent resource allocation). 4.

Publication dates ranged from 2010 to 2017 with most of the articles being published from 2014 to 2017. The increased volume of literature during these four years was concurrent with the Ebola crisis and other infectious disease outbreaks around the world. The literature has centered on Asian and African nations, with few articles addressing other geographic areas. Research articles are increasingly present in the literature but, to date, have been limited to non-experimental and descriptive studies. Governmental and non-governmental organizations have been the key producers of social media for health in LMICs, while end-users are typically young or marginalized populations. With its recent use in outbreak, crisis, and disaster management and control, Twitter has been the most popular platform reported in the literature.",

The first issue is the narrow geographic focus of the existing literature; the absence of literature focusing on regions such as Eastern Europe or the Middle East means that we have no information on the prevalence, types of use, or barriers to the use of social media use for health in these areas. There are also population groups that have been neglected, such maternal-child populations. Although there has been considerable research focused on mHealth and maternal-child health [60] , our scoping review did not identify maternal-child health as a focal topic or potential user group for social media use in LMICs. Social media may be a useful adjunct to the use of mHealth applications concerning maternal-child health, and its use for these populations should be studied. Utilizing social media for maternal-child health education and behaviour change campaigns could be a viable way for research in this specific context to begin. Future research should include prevalence studies to identify who is and who is not using social media, what social media platforms are being used, and well-designed survey studies to identify preferences and barriers to use of social media for health in the context of LMICs. Experimental and well-designed quasi-experimental studies are also needed to test aspects of social media use for health in LMICS, for example, to inform implementation strategies.",

Despite the limited volume of the literature, there is evidence that the use of social media in LMICs has the potential for far-reaching influence on health, especially for public health issues. Social media has the ability to facilitate disease surveillance, mass communication, health education, knowledge translation, and collaboration among health providers. However, concerns about the information quality and the potential for misinformation may act as a barrier to its use. Moreover, misinformation or poorly communicated information can contribute to negative health behaviours and adverse health outcomes amongst consumers [61] , as well as hysteria and chaos. In addition to attending to accuracy, organizations using social media should give attention to the readability of an organization's social media pages and platforms to build credibility and enhance user friendliness. Promotion of credible social media sites by governments, health care professionals and researchers, as well as education on the appropriate use of social media, could help to lessen the effect of misinformation. Finally, there may be lessons to be learned from the leap-frog effect that has been observed in relation to the use of social media for health purposes in LMICs, with the potential for rapid advances to be made in other areas of health care or other sectors, such as education.",

Second, although an effort was made to minimize publication bias by searching systematically for grey literature through Google and Google Scholar search engines, publication bias cannot be entirely excluded. For example, each search in the Google database yielded several hundred thousand results, but for time and resource reasons, the search was limited to the first ten pages of each search result. This may have led to some relevant results being unintentionally excluded. However, as both Google and Google Scholar search results are generally sorted by relevance, with the most applicable information listed first [63] , this may have limited the degree of publication bias.

The researchers found that the participants were overall comfortable with participating in the peer-to-peer Facebook intervention, were more likely to have safe sex, and more likely to get tested for HIV regularly. 11 Gu et al. 2014 Internet surveillance was used to investigate the public reaction to the H7N9 outbreaks over time during the first 25 days of the H7N9 epidemic in China in the spring of 2013. The indexes of public reaction, daily posted and forwarded number of blogs and Baidu Attention Index (BAI) from Baidu website, to H7N9 outbreaks were significantly higher in 7 provinces/cities with human H7N9 cases than those in 2 provinces without cases. Both daily posted and forwarded number and BAI were positively associated with the cumulative case fatality rate of human H7N9 infection. 12 Gurman et al. 2015 Study findings indicate that the ways in which organizations used Twitter changed over time. Chi-square analyses demonstrated that organizations decreased in their use of certain strategies to disseminate information through Twitter, such as the use of links. Organizations did not change in their use of techniques to involve users (e.g., retweet, call to action), with the exception of using tweets as a fundraising mechanism. 13 Hamill et al. 2015",

            "text": "Three key themes emerged from data analysis of the TB&Me blog: participants found that blogging was useful for adherence to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment, provided alternative support to patients and gave patients strength and voice, and provided a tool for patient expression and empowerment. Triangulation of results showed that the predominant ideas and majority themes found in the blogger participant group were echoed in the project staff group. The responses of the stakeholder group supported some of the blogger and project staff responses, as well as providing insight into blog exposure and access. 16 International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies 2014 By targeting communications and operational staff, the projects were able to combine on-the ground knowledge of programs with communications expertise. While technology continues to transform humanitarian communications at a rapid rate, it is essential to consider the different starting point of each National Society in relation to the specific country context, the internet accessibility and the internal resources and capacities. The workshop and training from this project have helped to develop a skilled set of social media representatives from each National Society, as well as providing a forum by which colleagues from within the region can share their learning and examples of best practice. 17 Jamwal, et al. 2016 The evidence reviewed by this article found YouTube to be an increasingly important and utilized medium for use in aspects of palliative care practice worldwide. Within developing countries however, more efficacy studies on the impact of this platform on palliative care delivery are still needed. 18 Jiang and Beaudoin 2016 Microblog posts from the Sina Weibo platform were analyzed showing the most common content characteristics of perceived risk, subjective norms, and self-efficacy within the context of smoking prevention and cessation. 19 Kituyi et al. 2014 No findings yet as this is just the proposal. 20 Krueger et al. 2016 This study sampled Peruvian men who have sex with men (MSM) in order to determine the association between HIV testing and behavioural, demographic and stigma-related factors in this population. Findings suggest younger men were found to be significantly more associated with lower rates of testing, those who participated in online discussions about HIV testing were more likely to be tested themselves, and AIDS-related stigma remains a significant obstacle for MSM and HIV testing. 21 Kwaak et al. 2010 This chapter highlights some of the findings and recommendations of a diagnostic study and related life-skills workshop that assessed the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) information and service needs of young people living with HIV in Kenya with a view to identifying opportunities for the use of social media to address some of these needs. The findings of the diagnostic study show that the SRH needs of HIV-positive young people require social programs that address their aspirations and rights in the context of chronic illness and vulnerability. There is also a need for innovative strategies such as the use of social media to address issues of SRH, empowerment, selfesteem, desires and professional aspirations of HIV-positive adolescents within HIV and AIDS programs. 22 Liu et al. 2016 In order to understand and evaluate public reaction in China to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014 through Internet surveillance, Baidu Index (BDI) and Sina Micro Index (SMI) data were collected from their official websites. Hotspot areas were identified and qualitative analysis indicated public attention increased with negative news until the appearance of a positive news statement. This study highlighted the potential use of online surveillance in relation to public communication and education in infectious disease contexts. 23 Lukhele et al. 2016 This study attempted to investigate the relationship between multiple sexual partners (MSP) and their correlates among Swaziland Facebook users. Findings revealed a significant association between having MSP and time spent on Facebook and having had sex with someone met on Facebook. In a high-HIV prevalent setting such as Swaziland, the effect of potential risky sexual behaviours among Facebook users should be noted. 24 Lwin et al. 2014 A social media system for dengue prevention in Sri Lanka is described, which includes predictive surveillance, civic engagement and health communication. The system, known as \"Mo-Buzz,\" established real-time connections between citizens and authorities, and provides the ability to forewarn about outbreaks, initiating preventative action. The authors present challenges and lessons learnt including content validation, stakeholder collaborations and applied trans-disciplinary research. The potential for this system to be replicated and used in other infectious disease outbreak situations is highlighted. 25 Lwin The overall receptivity assessment offered positive, above average scores (> 4.00) for reach of the three aspects of potential adoption of Mo-Buzz (response efficacy, self efficacy and intention-to-use), suggesting a definitive need for such a system. The strong feedback on response efficacy alludes to a prevailing public sentiment about the value of a pro-active, interactive system that can protect people from dengue by forewarning them about dengue outbreaks, and enables real-time communication with health authorities. The positive response on self-efficacy is testament to the latent power of mobile phones as tools of public health intervention delivery in Sri Lanka. Finally, the strong intention-to-use scores provide evidence-based encouragement for consideration of launching a public version of the Mo-Buzz system. 26 Maity et al. 2015 Misconceptions about Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) focused mainly on the transmission and symptoms of the disease. There was a gap in the understanding of the haemorrhagic nature of the disease. About 35% of the participants failed to realize that bleeding is one of the characteristic symptoms of EVD. Almost 40% of the study participants were not aware of a sexual mode of transmission. The results also showed that half of the study group had no idea that semen from a recovered patient harbors the virus for at least 7 weeks. One of the most important ways in which EVD can be prevented is by strict adherence to hand washing. This fact was unknown by 40% of the participants who were unaware of this basic practice of hygiene for preventing disease transmission. Awareness regarding the preventive measures, modes of transmission, and symptoms of EVD is required to fill the existing gaps in knowledge. 29 M\u00fcller et al. 2017",

Four main categories of hash tags were identified: geographical locations, terror attack, social support, and organizations. The abundance of Twitter accounts providing official information made it difficult to synchronize and follow the flow of information. Many organizations posted simultaneously, by their manager and by the organization itself. Creating situational awareness was facilitated by information tweeted by the public. Threat assessment was updated through the information posted on social media. Security breaches led to the relay of sensitive data. At times, misinformation was only corrected after two days. The authors recommend development of a standard operating procedure to enable multiple responders to observe and unite their social media feeds in emergency situations. 37 Southwell et al. 2016 (continued on next page) The relationships between news coverage, online search behaviour, and social media mentions related to the Zika virus were analyzed in early 2016. Results suggest that official public health authority announcements offer small windows for information sharing, engagement, and online searching that offer opportunities through education. Outside of these announcements, sharing and searching are less apparent. These findings suggest the potential benefit in paring announcements with the provision of information resources. 38 Thomas et al. 2013 Health care personnel respondents had a high knowledge of social media, and were favorably disposed to the use of social media in healthcare delivery. There exist a significant relationship between respondents' knowledge (r = 0.267; p < 0.05) and the perception of health personnel on the use of social media for health care delivery, while there is no significant difference (F = 0.956; p > 0.05) in respondents' perception of health personnel on the use of social media for health care delivery across the medical personnel interviewed. Many health care personnel in Oyo state they have a robust knowledge of social media and think it can be very useful for healthcare delivery, they still do not use it or even see the feasibility of its implementation in Nigeria. This is largely due to the fact that they do not think their patients will accept the idea, a large percentage that is illiterate and ignorant of social media. 39 van Heijningen et al. 2017",

Loyalty to traditional cultural practices (Fa'a Samoa) underpinned views on the limited influence of media on social norms around tobacco use. Parents were thought to have the greatest influence on youth smoking. Tobacco use was viewed as a personal or family issue, and not a problem that was amendable to change at a societal level. Strikingly, there was a general lack of understanding about the influence media has on tobacco use opinions, attitudes and behaviour. 28 McGough et al. 2017 This study attempted to create a predictive model of Zika cases in Latin America.
