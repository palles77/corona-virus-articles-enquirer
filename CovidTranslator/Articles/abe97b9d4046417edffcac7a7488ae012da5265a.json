However, some patients can remain asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and atypical presentations such as gastroenteritis have occurred. 1 As of Dec 2, 2013, 163 laboratory-confi rmed cases, including 71 deaths, have been reported to WHO. 2 All of these cases were directly or indirectly linked to the Middle East region, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, and Jordan.",

MERS-CoV belongs to the lineage C betacoronaviruses, which are associated with bats 3 and the closest relatives of MERS-CoV have been identifi ed in vesper bats from Europe, Asia, and South Africa. [4] [5] [6] Notably, this coronovirus is able to replicate in various bat cell lines. 7 Molecular clock dating of epidemiologically unlinked human MERS-CoV isolates estimated their divergence from a common ancestor in mid-2011, with a cluster of isolates from the eastern parts of the Arabian peninsula diverging in late 2012. These fi ndings suggest that the reported MERS-CoV diversity in human beings is the result of several independent, geographically structured, zoonotic events from an unknown reservoir in the Middle East. 8, 9 Human-to-human transmission has been noted, especially in health-care settings and households, but is thought to be relatively ineffi cient. 1 To determine how circulation of MERS-CoV in human beings is maintained and to mitigate the chain of transmission, identifi cation of possible animal reservoirs and modes of transmission is needed. 10 Limited available exposure history of patients suggest that contact with livestock, including dromedary camels, might have a role. 1, 9, 11, 12 In addition, our recent investigations have provided evidence for the circulation of MERS-CoV or a related virus in dromedary camels. 13 Both MERS-CoV spike protein binding antibodies and virus neutralising antibodies were reported in dromedary camels from diff erent regions, including Oman and Egypt, but no virus shedding could be detected and, therefore, the signifi cance of these observations remained an issue of debate. 13, 14 In this study we aimed to assess presence of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels from a farm in Qatar that was linked to two human cases of MERS-CoV.",

            "text": "In October, 2013, the Qatar Supreme Council of Health recorded two cases of laboratory confi rmed MERS-CoV. Case 1 involved a 61-year-old man who was the owner of a farm that he visited regularly. The patient had substantial contact with animals including camels, sheep, pigeons, and hens, and no history of travel outside of Qatar in the 2 weeks before becoming ill. MERS-CoV infection was diagnosed by E gene (upE) PCR on a sputum sample collected on Oct 13, 2013, in the National Virology Laboratory of Qatar. Case 2 involved a 23-year-old male employee of the farm owned by case 1 and was identifi ed in the close-contact investigation of that case. He was reported on Oct 17, 2013, and had no underlying medical conditions and no recent travel history, but had regular contact with the animals on the farm. MERS-CoV infection was diagnosed in a throat swab taken on Oct 17, 2013, by the National Virology Laboratory of Qatar. Diagnosis for both cases was confi rmed (ORF1b and N gene PCR) by Public Health England. 15, 16 Qatari authorities, with support from WHO, did an epidemiological investigation at the farm within 1 week of diagnosis of the fi rst case, which included the collection of various clinical samples from the farm's dromedary camels. Full details of the outbreak investigation will be described elsewhere.",

We generated PhyML phylogenetic trees with Seaview 4 software with the approximate likelihood-ratio test based on a Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure, which used a general time reversible as substitution model. We used nearest neighbour interchange and subtree pruning and regrafting-based tree search algorithms to estimate the tree topologies. 19 RNA from human samples (sputum for Qatar 3 case and throat swab for Qatar 4 case) was extracted with the NucliSENS easyMag system (bioM\u00e9rieux, Basingstoke, UK).

We and others previously reported MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies in dromedary camels from the Canary Islands, Oman, and Egypt, suggesting circulation of MERS-CoV or a MERS-CoV-like virus in camels. 13, 14 High prevalences and antibody titres were reported in the camels from Oman and Egypt suggesting widespread circulation. However, virological testing was unable to detect MERS-CoV viral sequences in camels, probably because only faecal and serum samples were analysed. In addition, shedding kinetics of MERS-CoV in camels (and human beings) are unknown, and therefore, inter pretation of negative RT-PCR results from screening is diffi cult because positive and negative predictive values remain to be determined. 22 In the outbreak reported, we showed evidence for presence of the virus in six camels according to internationally recommended criteria of two independent RT-PCR targets. Furthermore, we used sequence confi rmation as an additional test to increase the level of certainty-during an emerging disease outbreak such as this, options for validation of assays for clinical testing are limited. 22 Discrepancies between assays can be explained by diff erences in detection limits, or by diff erences in specifi city of the primer sets. In our study, N gene RT-PCR yielded four additional weak positive results that could not be confi rmed by any other method, and an individual ORF1a RT-PCR identifi cation was made for only one animal. These cases could have resulted from mispriming, or represent presence of levels of virus around the detection limit, as can be expected at the end of the infection cycle.
