At the end of the nineteenth century, when the microbial etiology of many infectious diseases had been established, pathologists recognized that there were a number of common infectious diseases of man and his domesticated animals for which neither a bacterium nor a protozoan could be incriminated as the causal agent. In 1898, Loeflter and Frosch demonstrated that foot-and-mouth disease could be transferred from one animal to another by material which could pass through a filter that retained the smallest bacteria. Following this discovery such diseases were tentatively ascribed to what were first called 'ultramicroscopic filterable viruses ', then 'ultrafilterable viruses', and, ultimately, just 'viruses' . The word 'virus' itself, originally meaning a disease-producing poison, was appropriated to this particular class of agents because of the currency that Jenner had given to the term in describing cowpox and smallpox viruses a hundred years earlier.

The protein coat of an isometric particle, or the elongated protein tube of viruses with helical symmetry, is called the capsid (Fig. 1) The chemical units are sometimes held together by disulfide bonds to form the structural units, hence the practice of using reducing agents in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis when analyzing viral proteins to determine their constituent polypeptides. The structural units are held together to form the capsid by noncovalent bonds, which may be polar (salt and hydrogen bonds) or nonpolar (van der Waals and hydrophobic bonds). The capsids of some viruses are readily disrupted in molar calcium or sodium chloride, suggesting electrovalent bonds between the structural units; others are unaffected by salt and can only be disrupted by detergents, suggesting that they are hydrophobically bonded. The capsomers of isometric viruses are arranged with icosahedral symmetry, because the icosahedron is that polyhedron with cubic symmetry which, if constructed of identical subunits, would least distort the subunits or the bonds between them.",

At the other end of the nomenclatural spectrum, there is hopeless confusion in the ways in which the terms 'species', 'type', 'subtype', and 'strain' are used. For example, 'types' of influenza virus exhibit no serological cross-reactivity and their nucleic acids do not hybridize; they are not classified as distinct species or genera. On the other hand, many alphaviruses and flaviviruses with distinct names, which exhibit extensive serological cross-reactivity, should perhaps be regarded as types within the same species. Serological cross-reactivity and nucleic acidhybridization tests are probably most useful for making comparisons at this 'species' level.",

CLASSIFICATION BASED ON PHYSICOCHEMICAL CRITERIA The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has agreed that classification should be based on physicochemical criteria, and Bot upon such properties as host range or symptomatology. Tables 3 and 9 summarize data on the morphology and chemistry of the viruses of vertebrates, and Fig. 3 illustrates their size and structure. The structure of the brick-shaped virion is complex, consisting of a biconcave DNAcontaining core surrounded by several membranes of viral origin. There is a poxvirus group antigen which is probably an internal component of the virion, and can be demonstrated by complement fixation or gel diffusion tests. Several enzymes, including a transcriptase, are found within mature virions. Multiplication occurs in the cytoplasm and the virions mature in cytoplasmic foci. Occasionally, the virion may be released within a loose membrane derived from the cytoplasmic membrane. This is not essential for infectivity, and must be distinguished from the envelope of viruses that mature by budding through cellular membranes. tSome of these families (Poxviridae, Iridoviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae and Picornaviridae) include genera or members that multiply only in invertebrates; others (Reoviridae and Rhabdoviridae) contain genera that multiply only in plants. Where the third (host) term includes the letter 'I' (Iridoviridae, Reoviridae, Bunyaviridae, Rhabdoviridae and Togaviridae) at least some of the viruses that infect vertebrates also multiply in vertebrates (i.e. they are arboviruses). The family is divided into several genera (Table 4) , arm several poxviruses have still to be classified. The properties outlined for the family apply to all the genera, except that the virions of members of genera Parapoxvirus and Capripoxvirus (see Table 4 ), and swinepox virus, are narrower than those of other poxviruses, and virions of orf have a distinctive surface structure. Species within each genus show a high degree of serological cross-reactivity by neutralization as well as complement fixation tests. Genetic recombination occurs within, but not between, genera; nongenetic reactivation (complementation) occurs between most poxviruses of vertebrates.",

An important property of many papovaviruses is their capacity to produce tumors. In nature, the papillomaviruses produce single benign tumors (which may undergo malignant change) and are highly host specific; several of the polyomaviruses may cause primary malignant tumors within a short period of their inoculation into new-born rodents. Parvoviruses (parvo = small) are unique among the DNA viruses of vertebrates in that their genome is a single molecule of .single-stranded DNA. Two genera are recognized: several viruses of rodents which are 'normal' infectious viruses (Parvovirus) , and the adeno-associated viruses, which are able to replicate only in cells concurrently infected with an adenovirus. In the adeno-associated viruses the single strands of DNA found in a population of virions are complementary and anneal after extraction to form a double strand. The family Reoviridae (sigla: respiratory enteric orphan) contains three genera that infect vertebrates, Reovirus, Orbivirus and Rotavirus, which show minor differences in morphology and the size of their genome, but all are non-enveloped isometric viruses whose genome consists of ten pieces of double-stranded RNA (Table 10) .",

Because both can be transmitted orally it is better to use noncommital names for them; 'serum hepatitis' is now termed hepatitis B; infective hepatitis, hepatitis A. Study of these viruses has been greatly inhibited by the lack of susceptible laboratory animals (chimpanzees may get clinical hepatitis; marmosets and rhesus monkeys subclinical infection, while other laboratory animals are insusceptible), and the difficulty of obtaining reproducible cytopathic changes in cultured cells. The recognition in the sera of cases of serum hepatitis of lipoprotein particles of characteristic serological specificity, 'Australia antigen', now hepatitis B antigen (HB-Ag), has led to a great expansion in studies on the incidence and pathogenesis of hepatitis B, but the actual virions have not yet been analysed.",

Family: Picornaviridae [R/l: 2.3-2.8/30: S/S: V/I, O, R] The picornavirus group (sigla: pico = small; rna = ribonucleic acid), which includes a very large number of viruses, is a family, Picornaviridae, with three genera: Enterovirus (entero = intestine), Rhinovirus (rhino = nose), and Calicivirus (calici = cup). Genus: Enterovirus [R/l: 25130: S/S: V/I, O, R]. Enteroviruses have the family characteristics of the Picornaviridae. The particles are 20-30 nm in diameter, acid stable",
