            "text": "Bats are considered to be natural reservoirs for several viruses of clinical importance, including rabies virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus. Type I interferons (IFNs) is an important part of the immune system in the defense against viral infection. To investigate the function of type I IFNs upon viral infection in bats, the nucleic acid, and amino acid sequences of Egyptian Rousette (Rousettus aegyptiacus) IFN-a and -b were characterized. Sequence data indicated that bat IFN-a consists of 562-bp encoded 187aa, and IFN-b consisted of 558-bp encoded 186-aa. Phylogenetic analysis of the overall identity of IFN-b shared the highest sequence homology with pig IFN-b in both nucleotide and amino acid level. Stimulation of bat primary kidney cells (BPKCs) and bat lung cell lines, Tb-1 Lu, with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) or exogenous bat type I IFNs resulted in increased type I IFNs mRNA expression in BPKCs, but not in Tb-1 Lu. Characterization of the bat IFN-a and -b genes allows understanding of the immune responses upon stimulation in different tissues, thus providing practical strategies for control and treatment of clinically important diseases. These results are important especially for the virus infection, and suggest that future molecular studies on virus infection experiment of bats in vitro will require careful consideration of the differences of type I IFN expression patterns in different cell types. #",

Bat has two suborders, Megachiroptera (flying fox) and Microchiroptera (insectivorous bat). Many emerging or re-emerging viruses, such as rabies, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus, were isolated form Megachiroptera. In particular, European bat lyssavirus type I was also isolated from Rousettus sp. (Van der Poel et al., 2000; Wellenberg et al., 2002; Wong et al., 2007) . Bats were thought to have an important role for the infection cycle of these emerging and re-emerging viruses. In vivo experiment, www.elsevier.com/locate/vetimm Available online at www.sciencedirect.com Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 124 (2008) [169] [170] [171] [172] [173] [174] [175] [176] Ebola virus inoculation studies showed that both flying foxes and insectivorous bats support viral replication and circulation with high viral titers without becoming ill (Swanepoel et al., 1996) . Studies in vitro have shown that Ebola virus VP35 protein blocks the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and Ebola virus VP24 protein inhibits interferon (IFN) signaling (Basler et al., 2003; Reid et al., 2006) . These data suggested that Ebola virus might evade the anti-viral activity of IFNs in bat cells. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate IFN regulation and function in bats because few immunological studies have been reported for this animal species.",

            "text": "Cells have many responses to viral infection. One of the responses is the secretion of type I IFNs which are composed of multiple a subtypes and a single b subtype (Sen, 2001) . Type I IFNs expression utilize two signal transduction pathways; the Toll-like receptor (TLR)dependent pathway and TLR-independent pathway. In TLR-dependent pathway, cells recognize viral doublestrand RNA, single-strand RNA and CpG DNA via TLR, and subsequently IFN-b is induced. In TLRindependent pathway, intracellular sensors such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (mda-5) detect viral components in the cytoplasm, and transactivate IFN-b mRNA (Hiscott et al., 2006) . Expressed IFN-b binds to the type I IFN receptors and activates numerous IFNstimulated genes, such as the protein kinase R (PKR) gene, the 2 0 -5 0 oligoa-denylate synthetases (OAS) gene, and the myxovirus resistance (Mx) gene. The product of these genes controls viral infection (Samuel, 2001) . Viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a viral intermediate in the proliferation of many RNA viruses, is known as an IFN-inducer through these sensors (Gitlin et al., 2006) . Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) is a synthetic mimetic of viral dsRNA and a strong inducer of type I IFNs in vivo and in vitro via these sensors (Hertzog et al., 2003) .",

The full-length bat IFN-a ORF was 562 bp and encoded 187-aa polypep-tides. Bat IFN-b ORF was 558 bp and encoded 186-aa polypeptides (Fig. 1(A and B) ). Direct comparison of bat IFN-a genes simultaneously against various animal species was complicated by the fact that there are various IFN-a subtypes and difficulties in the identification of subtype of the bat IFN-a. Therefore, sequence comparisons were performed using IFN-b between bat and human, pig, cat, horse, and mouse. The identity of bat IFN-b with human, pig, cat, horse, and mouse IFN-b were 77.5, 82.0, 78.3, 77.5, and 66.5% at the nucleotide level and 64. 2, 72.0, 61.8, 61.3, and 49 .5% at the amino acid level, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis using the amino acid sequences from several representative eutherian type I IFNs and chicken type I IFN found that both bat IFN-a and bat IFN-b are homologous to the mammalian IFN group. Further analysis showed that both bat IFN-a and IFN-b were most closely related to those of pig, and followed by horse (Fig. 2) . Although phylogenetic relationship between bat and other animals remains inconclusive, molecular phylogenetics using mitochondrial DNA or retro-transposon insertions indicated that Chiroptera is included in Fereuungrate or Pegasoferae (Perissodactyla, Carnivora, Pholidota, and Chiroptera) (Nikaido et al., 2000; Nishihara et al., 2006) . Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the cell surface molecule CD4 showed that bat is more closely related to cat and dog (Omatsu et al., 2006) . Our findings and these molecular phylogenetic analyses suggested that bat might have anti-viral mechanism similar to these animals. Some investigators indicated that Nipah virus spread from Megachiroptera to pig and then from pig to human (Tan and Wong, 2003) , and pig might be more susceptible to the virus than other animals. In contrast, relatively low Fig. 2 .

In BPKCs, there is an increase in the expression of IFN-b mRNA, but not IFN-a mRNA, at 3 h after poly(I:C) treatment. However, in Tb-1 Lu cells, poly(I:C) treatment induced IFN-a mRNA production but production of INF-b mRNA was not observed (Fig. 3(A) ). To examine whether BPKCs or Tb-1 Lu expresses type I IFN mRNA in response to the bat IFNcontaining medium (exogenous IFN), the expression of type I IFNs mRNA was examined at 0, 4, and 8 h after the exogenous IFN-treatment. In the case of BPKCs, IFN-a mRNA was detected at each time point with a gradual increase, and IFN-b mRNA which was not initially detected, peaked at 4 h in response to exogenous IFN (Fig. 3(B) ). In Tb-1 Lu, however, type I IFNs mRNA expression was not detected at all (data not shown). Although BPKCs could induce type I IFNs mRNA in response to poly(I:C) via TLR3, RIG-I, and mda-5, type I IFNs-inducing signal was not sufficient for the stimulation of IFN-a mRNA synthesis. In contrast, when type I IFNs were supplied to BPKCs, IFN-b mRNA was induced more rapidly than IFN-a. This indicated that IFN-b is involved in immediate response to invasion of viruses or microbes and IFN-a, which is responsible for anti-viral activity via stimulation of PKR, OAS, and Mx synthesis, is induced by IFNb and has more prolonged response in BPKCs (Fig. 3(B) ). When Tb-1 Lu were treated with either poly(I:C) or bat IFNs-containing medium, these cells did not express any IFN-a or IFN-b mRNA. This suggests that in Tb-1 Lu the mechanism of dsRNA recognition or the signaling pathway reacted to exogenous IFNs is not utilized for up-regulation of type I IFNs mRNA. Thus, the IFN signal responding to both poly(I:C) and exogenous type I IFNs was different between BPKCs and Tb-1 Lu. Bat is diversified into about a thousand species in the world. These results further indicated that extra considerations should be taken in the interpretation of experimental data of antiviral dynamics among various bat cell types and species.",

Thus, the nucleotide sequences of type I IFNs of Rousette bat were characterized for the first time. To investigate whether and how bats harbor clinically important pathogens, some basic information from inoculation studies performed in vivo and in vitro is very important. To determine how wild animals remain asymptomatic to pathogens, it will be necessary to understand their viral control mechanisms, such as IFN signaling. Using bats as representative pathogenic carriers, this study provides some basic and important immunological information about bat. It is necessary for understanding zoonoses from bat, especially for Megachiroptera.
