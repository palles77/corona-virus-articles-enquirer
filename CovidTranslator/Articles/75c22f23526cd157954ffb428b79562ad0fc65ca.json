We took nasal aspirates during reported episodes of upper respiratory-tract illness and tested for infection by common respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria with RT-PCR assays. We used generalised estimating equations to assess the relation between low (<7\u00b75 g/m 3 ), medium (7\u00b75-14 g/m 3 ), and high (>14 g/m 3 ) tertiles of NO 2 exposure in the week before or after upper respiratory-tract infection and the severity of asthma exacerbation in the week after the start of an infection.",

A risk ratio of 1\u00b72 for increments of 30 \u00b5g/m 3 indoor NO 2 exposure (equivalent to the presence of a gas cooker in the home) was derived from a meta-analysis of 11 studies. 3 From our pilot study we expected a 30 \u00b5g/m 3 equivalent difference in the personal NO 2 exposure between the lowest and highest tertiles. We did simulations to assess the effect of the absence of independence of episodes within a child, and this seemed to have a minimal effect on estimates of the standard errors of the coefficient for NO 2 exposure. Even with extremely high correlation between episodes within children, the standard error only increased by 14%. If three to four episodes were reported per child, we anticipated 70% to 80% power, respectively, based on standard methods for the analysis of proportions, with the assumption of a risk ratio of 1\u00b72 for children distributed between the highest and lowest tertiles. Furthermore, we anticipated the power of the analysis would be further improved by use of actual personal NO 2 values in a regression model rather than crude categorical differences in exposure such as the presence or absence of a gas cooker. We estimated that with a sample size of 100-120 children, we would have sufficient power to test our main objectives.",

Continuous personal NO 2 monitoring was needed to capture exposures accurately immediately before and after the start of an infection. Less frequent monitoring would have been inadequate because of the significant week to week variability in NO 2 exposures in children of this age, as reported in our pilot study. 12 Although the measurement of personal NO 2 exposure improved the quality of data compared with static indoor NO 2 monitoring in the home, we estimated 7-day exposures before an infection by the weighted average of exposure in the two adjacent weeks. This approach would be expected to mask any relation between exposure and asthma exacerbations if exposure was misclassified. Furthermore, the use of a panel of RT-PCR assays identified many more infections than would have been possible with less sensitive conventional diagnostic methods. 15 We have previously assessed how indoor and outdoor sources contributed to the temporal variation of personal NO 2 exposure in children. In a study of 46 children aged 9-11 years, personal NO 2 exposure was assessed in parallel with measurements in the child's home, classroom, and school outdoors for three week-long periods. Although personal exposures correlated weakly with concentrations of NO 2 recorded in the home, the relation was far from precise. Factors associated with increased personal exposure included the use of gas appliances, cohabitation with smokers, and travel to school by means other than a car. However, together these variables explained less than 30% of the temporal variation in personal exposures. 12 We have also investigated the relation between fluctuations in personal NO 2 exposure in this group of Southampton schoolchildren and changes in outdoor NO 2 concentrations measured at a fixed site in the centre of Southampton for 32 weeks. Of the 114 children monitored in the study, all but two lived within 20 km of the outdoor monitoring station, and 50 were resident in the city (near major roads). We confirmed that there was great variation from week to week in personal NO 2 exposure in children and that little, if any, of this variation was the result of fluctuations in the concentrations of NO 2 in outdoor air, even when the analyses were restricted to children residing in the city and those from homes that did not use gas for cooking. 18 Despite any limitation in recording mean personal NO 2 exposure per week, the findings from both studies emphasised the need for personal monitoring of NO 2 exposure instead of outdoor and indoor measurements to reduce misclassification of true exposure, which could reduce the power of the study and mask any important health effect.",

            "text": "There are several potential mechanisms by which NO 2 exacerbates asthma in the presence of viral infections. 23 These include direct effects on the upper and lower airways by ciliary dyskinesis, 24 epithelial damage, 25 increases in pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines, 26 rises in IgE concentration, 27 and interaction with allergens, 28 or indirectly through impairment of bronchial immunity. 11 Results of two in-vitro studies lend support to our observations by showing that NO 2 exposure before infection might increase the susceptibility of respiratory epithelial cells to injury from respiratory syncytial virus 29 and concurrent exposure could exacerbate rhinovirusinduced inflammation. 30 The effects could also be mediated by an increase in intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, the major group rhinovirus receptor) in the presence of air pollution, which could heighten the risk of rhinovirus infection. 31 Separate analyses have allowed us to show possible biological differences between virus types. It is noteworthy that the trends indicating an association between NO 2 exposure and severity of asthma exacerbation were consistent in direction for all viruses, for picornavirus and for respiratory syncytial virus, but not coronavirus (figure 1). Both respiratory syncytial viruses and picornaviruses are known to infect the lower respiratory tract, 32 but there is no evidence to show that this is the case for coronaviruses. The absence of an association with coronavirus could be because the numbers of such infections were small or because they might not interact with NO 2 in the way that respiratory syncytial virus or picornavirus do. Or perhaps, they are unable to infect the lower respiratory tract, a suggestion that is supported by previous findings that coronaviruses are much less likely than other virus types to cause a drop in PEF or an increase in lower respiratory-tract symptoms in asthmatic children aged 9-11 years. 6 Increases in symptom scores were measured on an arbitrary scale, and the size of the increases in virusinduced lower respiratory-tract symptoms was just over half a point for all viruses together. The increase was more than 2 points (the equivalent of transition from none to moderate, or mild to severe symptoms) for respiratory syncytial virus alone. However, although the absolute increase in severity of LRT scores and reductions in PEF were modest, they should be interpreted within the context of several factors. First, the increase in the median lower respiratory-tract symptom scores between the week before and after infection was 1 (arbitrary units), and likewise, the reduction in PEF between the same was 16 L/min. Therefore, the increased severity of these symptom scores represents increases of 60-200%, and reductions in PEF of 75% compared with changes in median scores between the weeks before and after infection for all children. Second, the major site of NO 2induced lung injury is the transitional zone (the area between the terminal bronchioles and alveoli), 33 so conventional pulmonary function tests (such as PEF) that are sensitive to changes in large airway function might be an insensitive method of detecting the responses in small peripheral airways. Third, as most children in this study used \u2424 2 agonists (87%), symptom severity and decrements in peak expiratory flow might have been diminished and led to the effects of NO 2 exposure and virus infections being underestimated if measured during an exacerbation. Although reductions in peak expiratory flow and increases in lower respiratory-tract symptoms were small, because of the ubiquitous nature of NO 2 exposure the proportion of children exposed would lead to a large number with attributable morbidity if applied to the general population of asthmatic children.",

Investigators suggest that personal NO 2 concentrations during cooking hours exceed weekly average personal NO 2 exposures by an order of three to five. 34 This calculation would translate a weekly average of 21 g/m 3 personal NO 2 exposure (as we noted for the highest tertile of exposure) into several hours of exposure to NO 2 concentrations in the 60-100 g/m 3 range. Likewise, 20% of children who had personal NO 2 exposures of more than 100 g/m 3 are likely to have had peak concentrations of 300-500 g/m 3 at least once. Such concentrations are higher than would be expected from other sources of NO 2 , and would exceed thresholds judged safe by WHO air quality standards. 17 That NO 2 was not the causative agent but a marker of other unmeasured gas-related indoor pollutants, such as particulates, is possible. 35 Although gas cookers could generate ultrafine particulates, we believe that the effect of particulates from other indoor sources is unlikely because children who lived with smokers (cigarette smoke is a major source of particulates in indoor air) were specifically excluded from the study.",
