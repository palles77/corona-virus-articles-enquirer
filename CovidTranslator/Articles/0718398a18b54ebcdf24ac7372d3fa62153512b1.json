Typical cleaning documentation will include a policy statement, a schedule and procedures, detailed instructions on how to clean each area or piece of equipment, as well as record forms. Increasingly, the process is being supported by various software tools. Auditors may well ask to see both the cleaning programs, as well as results and trends obtained from monitoring, that is, the routine assessment of cleaning efficacy. Cleaning regimens need to be current and part of the documented control system. Cleaning documentation should comprehensively cover cleaning equipment and materials. It is logical that you cannot get something clean without getting something else dirty and this has implications for materials-equipment, water, etc. to be used in cleaning. Failure to maintain cleaning equipment appropriately can result in cleaning equipment being a vehicle for cross-contamination.

The European Food Directives are sometimes unclear on rinsing: some state it should be undertaken but others allow it as an option, if it can be assured that there are no residual chemicals that can adversely affect food, people, or equipment. The main argument in favor of rinsing is the removal of cleaning chemicals and possibly reducing the chances of developing biocide resistance, but this needs to be weighed against the microbiological quality of available water (at point of use, not entry into the premises), the Used as additional disinfection step to try to eliminate any residual or persistent pathogens or spoilage organisms potential for recontamination of cleaned surfaces and the need to preserve a dry processing environment. In the United States, a number of sanitizers have approved limits for nonrinse application. If there are concerns about surface counts after cleaning, the use of these sanitizers first at higher levels, followed by rinsing, followed by their application at a norinse level has been suggested (Tompkin et al., 1999) . A further optional step used by some processors is to apply a gaseous bactericide, for example, ozone, hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV), or chlorine dioxide as an additional \"terminal disinfection\" stage. Ozone, for example, can achieve an extra kill before decomposing to oxygen (Moore et al., 2000; Bailey et al., 2007) . Deciding if this is necessary is best left to the individual company, bearing in mind the type and concentration of cleaning chemicals used, local water quality, type of product, and the level of risk associated with it. It is important to realize, however, that the different stages in cleaning are interlinked and cumulatively help to ensure overall effectiveness. They can also inform how and when monitoring is best undertaken.",

It is said that \"you cannot manage what you do not measure\" and after construction cleaning protocols need to be validated and verified. Validation means proving that the cleaning protocol is effective and is linked to the establishment of benchmark clean values. Validation will involve comprehensive testing of different aspects of the cleaning/disinfection protocols and can also help to identify difficult-to-clean areas and to inform the design of routine monitoring plans. All of these require some form of \"efficacy testing or surface sampling to assess cleanliness\" which is best performed using an integrated approach. Different assessment techniques each have advantages and disadvantages and provide different information on the cleaning performed. Along with efficacy testing, routine audits of cleaning can be an important part of the verification process.",

            "text": "Cleaning is the removal of soil and this process may also reduce the number of microorganisms present. Disinfection is specifically used to further reduce the number of microorganisms present and can be achieved using heat, chemicals, or irradiation. Both cleaning and disinfection can be monitored, although readers are reminded that disinfection is much more difficult and less likely to be achieved if prior cleaning is inappropriately performed. Unfortunately there is no single \"ideal\" method (Table 44 .4) for assessing cleaning and disinfection efficacy-the testing approach selected must link back to the potential surface contamination, the hazards that the cleaning and disinfection program is intended to control and the level of cleanliness required for that surface. Most methods (microbiological and nonmicrobiological) can be affected by residual detergents or disinfectants and this needs to be considered in how and when to sample and the need to incorporate neutralizers into any wetting agents or reagents used. Fig. 44 .4 indicates the possible consequences and combinations of surface conditions after cleaning and, if necessary, disinfection. The reduction in organic residues ensures removal of food debris, allergens, etc. and helps reduce the number of microorganisms, as well as preparing the surface for any required disinfection. A low residual microbial surface count reduces the chances of food contamination and hence food spoilage and possibly foodborne disease. The presence or absence of residual moisture is important in helping to prevent cross-contamination, both by reducing the potential for future microbial growth and survival, and in reducing potential transfer rates. Transfer rates between surfaces can vary, from less than 1% to nearly 100% and are greatly increased in the presence of moisture (Harrison et al., 2003) . However, drying needs to be performed in a way that will not recontaminate the surface. Fig. 44 .5 outlines the various microbiological and nonmicrobiological methods that could be used to assess the efficacy of cleaning and/or disinfection and these will be discussed in more detail in Sections 44.3 and 44.4. Visual assessment has historically been the most widely used method to assess cleanliness and can use the unaided eye or make use of microscopy. At its simplest level the surface can be examined for the presence of visual soil-if the surface looks visually soiled then it has not been cleaned properly and further testing may be of limited value. However, absence of visual soil does not mean absence of invisible soil or microorganisms.",

It should be realized (although for some reason it is often attempted) that in food environments there is little value in trying to directly correlate surface microbial counts to ATP readings. Any correlations achieved could be described as \"coincidental\" and for a strong correlation, the ratio between microbial ATP and food debris ATP would need to be constant. This is unlikely to occur in many food premises and sites, with the possible exception of some hand-contact surfaces . It is possible to have foods with a high ATP count and low microbial count (eg, UHT milk), thus a small increase in product residue can increase the surface ATP count but not microbial numbers. Similarly, depending on the food product, for example, raw foods, and their level of microbial contamination, it is possible to have a relatively low ATP increase with higher increases in microbial numbers. More recently ATP technology has been linked to the assessment of acid phosphatase, an enzyme found in RAW meat and poultry. After swabbing a surface and reacting for 2 or 5 min (depending on sensitivity required) light is emitted-the more light emitted the more acid phosphatase is present and therefore the less clean the surface. The enzyme is inactivated during cooking and surfaces used for cooked products should give low readings.",

In isolation it is not a good method for assessing anything other than gross surface soil. However, most auditors will take a torch (flashlight) with them to inspect the visual cleanliness of dark/hidden, out-of-the-way places in food premises. More recently dye tests have been developed (invisible to the naked eye but visible under UV light) and are finding particular use in health care (Boyce et al., 2011) . These are essentially a test of cleaning method rather than routine or random testing for surface cleanliness. Their use in the food industry could be hampered by the possibility of dye residues getting into food, causing safety or organoleptic problems, although possibly they could find use in nonfood-contact areas. The dye has to be covertly applied to surfaces prior to cleaning and cleaning can be deemed acceptable if it has been removed. Simple visual assessment can be combined with magnification/microscopy, as well as touch, dust, or powder to detect grease or other residues.",

The level of ATP within cells varies depending upon the type of cell, for example, animal, yeast, bacteria, and its phase of growth, but the ATP pool in living cells is normally kept consistent by regulatory mechanisms . The enzyme-substrate complex luciferin-luciferase converts the chemical energy associated with the ATP into light in a stoichiometric reaction with one photon of light produced by the hydrolysis of one molecule of ATP. The light emitted is normally measured in relative light units (RLUs), calibrated for each make of instrument and set of reagents. Therefore the readings obtained from assessing routine cleaning need to be compared with baseline data representing acceptable clean values.

High counts can be found in some fresh foods, for example, tomatoes, while other foods, especially highly processed foods such as fats, oils, or sugar, contain very low amounts. Detergents/sanitizers used in cleaning can have a similar effect to the extractants used in the tests and different studies have demonstrated that commonly used cleaning chemicals can cause either quenching or enhancement of the ATP signal. It is therefore desirable, for consistency of results, to ensure that cleaning agents are removed by rinsing before testing is performed. The repeatability and reliability of the instruments and their tests can vary considerably among manufacturers, but is generally superior to microbiological swabbing. The sensitivity of the instruments and their tests is variable and higher-sensitivity instrument/tests combinations can detect down to 0.1 fmol of ATP. There have been discussions over exactly how sensitive ATP tests need to be and although there is a demand for a certain minimum sensitivity, if a test could be too sensitive is more debatable. The key requirement is that they should be able to discriminate \"well cleaned\" from \"inadequately cleaned\" surfaces, which are important or relevant to a business. So, for example, requirements for surfaces in an aseptic fill product would be quite different from those in drains. While test manufacturers will provide guidance on clean benchmark levels, they are usually best determined on-site by the food business and then used as the basis for continuous improvement. ATP has also been adapted by some test manufacturers for the detection of allergen residues and it is claimed that some tests detect down to 0.1-5 ppm of allergen food residues.",

The stimulus is to develop a noninstrument-dependent test, that is cheap and functional. A range of other chemical residues including protein, reducing sugars, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), are available as the basis for rapid cleaning tests. Usually the tests lead to the production of a single, or sequence of, colored end-products within a specified time (1-10 min). The color changes can be qualitatively assessed visually. This can be subjective and the option to use a cheap sample instrument to measure and/or record the results is available for some tests, if needed. The subjectivity is most variable for marginally unclean surfaces, the clean or very dirty being less subjective. Some tests retain a swab-based format, while others use test strips impregnated with relevant reagents. Which, if any, of these tests will be of benefit to a food business will depend on a number of factors (Table 44 .6), not least of which is the sensitivity of the assay. Such tests, if cheaper and instrument-independent, may find potential use in food service establishments. Often criticized for poor cleanliness, they are the reported location for most outbreaks of food poisoning (Griffith, 2000) . Of the non-ATP assays, protein detection methods offer potential where the food residues, for example, poultry/meat/ dairy products, are high in protein and also offer particular use in detecting allergens (Easter, 2012) . Although not a specific allergen test, most important food allergens are proteinaceous in nature. In some of the assays, other food nonprotein, reducing components may also bring about a color change. Some methods make use of an enhanced Buiret reaction. Under alkaline conditions the peptide bonds of proteins form a complex with the copper II (Cu 2+ ) of the Buiret reagent, reducing it to Copper I (Cu + ) ions. These react with bicinchoninic acid, producing an intense purple color. Other protein tests make use of different so-called \"protein error indicator\" dyes (eg, tetrabromophenol blue), which change color in the presence of protein at a particular pH. These tests may be swab-based, although some versions use test strips or pads. Depending upon the food examined, protein tests may be more or less sensitive than ATP bioluminescence (Moore and Griffith, 2002c) . Detection levels between 1 and 10 \u00b5g of protein are possible depending on the test and if an incubation step is used. The intensity of the color and its speed of production provide an indication of the level of soiling, although results are usually just pass/fail. NAD and related forms are chemical residues, which are also widely distributed in biological materials, including foods and microorganisms. Hence, the level of NAD on a surface provides a measure of organic soiling. NAD is detected in a chemical reaction leading to the production of a pink/purple color on a test strip, within 5 min. As with the other chemical residue detection kits, lack of a positive reaction does not represent lack of microorganisms. The usefulness of the test needs to be trialed and this will depend upon the type of foods produced and the level of NAD they contain.",

In testing for pathogens it is usual to test a larger surface area, for example, 1000 cm 2 rather than the more conventional 100 cm 2 (Willes et al., 2013) . The medium inoculated by the swab used can be solid, semisolid, or liquid. In the former colonies counted on the surface are assumed to originate from one organism and this can contribute to variability. When wanting a count to reflect cleanliness for comparison purposes as part of a routine testing program a specific area (often 100 cm 2 ) should be swabbed.

A sterile swab, consisting of a more or less flexible shaft with a fibrous bud or tip, is premoistened in an appropriate wetting agent and inoculated by rubbing over the surface to be tested. The microorganisms transferred to the swab can then be cultivated and counted, either by inoculating the swab directly onto an appropriate solid culture medium or by releasing captured microorganisms into a known quantity of sterile recovery diluent, which is then used to prepare pour plates. This description of swabbing also indicates some of the variability in the technique (Moore and Griffith, 2007; Ismail et al., 2013; Downey et al., 2012) , which can considerably affect the apparent number of organisms recovered Griffith, 2002a, 2007) . If the number of microorganisms on a surface is known (as in laboratory conditions), and compared with the number obtained from swabbing, there is low recovery particularly at low surface population densities below 10 4 cells per cm 2 (Holah et al., 1988) . Additionally the swabbing technique lacks reliability, that is, repeatability and reproducibility are poor Griffith, 2002a,b, 2007; Moore et al., 2001) . Various \"standard\" methods are available, including ISO 18593:2004, although currently there is no universally accepted method of swabbing.

However, basic information is still lacking as to the optimum protocol and the effect that variations may have on recovery rates (Moore and Griffith, 2007) . Overall recovery can be seen as a function of the removal of microorganisms from the test surface, their release from the swab and their subsequent ability to grow. Recovery rates can vary from 0.1% to 25% (Moore and Griffith, 2007) and will depend on the technique used but an optimum recovery rate of 10% for Dacron swabs is not uncommon. The type and number of microorganisms sampled can have a major effect on recovery (Rose et al., 2011; Downey et al., 2012) and they can become increasingly difficult to remove once they have adhered to a surface (Cunliffe et al., 1999) , particularly in biofilms. Additionally, organism retention within the bud fibers results in poor repeatability and sensitivity. Techniques/variables that improve one element of the swabbing process may adversely affect another. One study (Moore and Griffith, 2002a) showed protocols that improved removal, adversely affected release. Optimum overall recovery may therefore be a trade-off or compromise between different components of the whole process.",

This lacks the normal fibrous bud, which is replaced with short textured flocked nylon in spatula or swab format. This device releases more of the organisms removed from a surface and can yield an approximate 1 log improved overall recovery compared with traditional swabs. An alternative approach has led to the development of a wet or dry vacuum bacterial collection system.

A swab, after testing a surface, is returned to its accompanying culture tube containing a liquid or semisolid agar incorporating an indicator system. Microorganisms removed from the surface and retained by the swab grow and, as they multiply their growth can be detected, for example, by a color change. The results are semiquantitative in that the number of bacteria is not recorded but the time taken for the indicator to change color is a measure of the original microbial load. Unclean surfaces, depending upon the extent of microbial contamination, can test positive within 12 hours. When nonspecific media are used a general aerobic colony count is obtained, alternatively a selective or enrichment medium is used to test for the indicator organism or pathogens. Indicator systems can be based on chromogenic, fluorogenic, or bioluminogenic detection principles. In chromogenic assays the medium changes color as a consequence of microbial metabolism, and depending on the test indicates either the presence or absence of pathogen/group of organisms or the approximate degree of microbial surface contamination. Traditionally this could detect relevant organisms within as short a time as 18 hours (depending on the organism being tested for). More recently this time has been reduced by combining cultivation with a bioluminogenic test using a luminometer which can considerably reduce the detection time . This offers, depending on shift patterns, an opportunity for corrective action to be taken before further food production takes place. Using this approach, which correlates well with traditional counts, the time taken for detection extends from 1 hour, if the surface is heavily contaminated, to 8 hours for lightly contaminated surfaces. Such bioluminogenic tests are available for coliforms, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, and Listeria. Being able to perform a combined microbial cultivation and ATP assay extends the usefulness of luminometers beyond the conventional approach for estimating ATP in surface residues.",

Recovery is by wiping a compressed sterile sponge (eg, cellulose acetate) of varying sizes over the test surface. Some have no swab shaft, and in order to avoid contamination, the sponge needs to be held using a sterile glove, usually provided with the sponge. Sponges may be premoistened or require the addition of a wetting agent. After inoculation the sponge is returned to a sterile envelope/packet and transported to a laboratory. After the addition of a suitable diluent to the envelope, usually followed by agitation/stomaching, the released organisms can be counted. Similar errors to those encountered in swabbing may occur, and there is some evidence to suggest that the sponge matrix retains even more of the recovered organisms than swabbing, resulting in lower overall recovery (Moore and Griffith, 2002b) . However sponges if returned to an enrichment medium for pathogen detection offer superior sensitivity and are not affected by the microorganisms being attached to the sponge matrix. Any organisms in the sponge go on to grow and multiply and contribute to a positive result. Some sponges also offer the advantage of greater surface area: being much bigger than conventional swabs they allow larger surface areas to be tested, and may therefore be more useful in testing surfaces for pathogens. Greater pressure can also be applied than with swabs. Other variations include sponges on sticks, and in France, the use of gauze to swab surfaces. Recently research has indicated that electrostatic wipes offered a better overall performance than swabs (Lutz et al., 2013) , however validation data on the effectiveness of some of these alternatives under a wide range of conditions and organisms are not widely available.",

They comprise a double-sided hinged paddle with a neutral or selective agar, attached to both sides. The paddle is contained within a transparent cylindrical tube or plastic container. The dipslide is removed, then pressed onto the surface to be tested, replaced back into the tube and resulting colony growth counted, or compared with pictorial estimates/diagrams of surface counts. They can also be used for counting the number of organisms in liquid samples of food, water, or rinse water. Recently a flexible hybrid contact plate/dipslide, to test more irregular-shaped surfaces, has become available. Other variations include the use of petrifilm to replace traditional agar plates for cultivation. These are small, thin films coated with nutrients and gelling agents. After wetting the film with approximately 1 mL of deionized water to rehydrate the growth medium, it can be used to provide a surface count. More recently a novel roller sampler was found to give a higher yield than conventional contact plates (Lutz et al., 2013) .",

However, this is not problematic if only an indication of cleaning adequacy, that is, pass or fail is required, rather than the precise number of organisms. It is easy to count the individual colonies, obtained from marginally unclean/clean surfaces, based on clean surface counts currently considered attainable (see Section 44.5.1). If a more precise number of colonies from a heavily contaminated surface is required then agar contact methods may be inappropriate.",

Cultivation methods still require time, usually one or more days (although as can be seen this is being reduced) and molecular methods offer faster speed (although hours as opposed to seconds), greater sensitivity, and specificity. Often based on either DNA or RNA these methods target and amplify specific sections of a microorganism's nucleic acid to a detectable level.

One potential disadvantage is that such techniques often do not distinguish between living microorganisms and noninfective nucleic acid and therefore only indicate that at some stage the organism was present on that surface-although they may be capable of detecting VBNC bacteria. At present, molecular methods require more technical expertise and high-cost equipment, are more expensive and are primarily used in outbreak investigations or to trace/track microorganisms within plants. However, with protocol advances it is likely in the future they will be used more routinely in assessing the effectiveness of primarily disinfection or in estimating risk. Ideally risk assessment also requires knowledge of the number of organisms and some molecular techniques can be made quantitative, for example, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). One laboratory study (Buttner et al., 2007) compared conventional cultivation with qPCR on a range of surfaces, although only one organism was tested. Cultivation techniques yielded few viable cells, whereas qPCR gave much higher results but represented nucleic acid from viable and nonviable cells. Depending on the analysis method used, sample pretreatment may be necessary, which can add to costs and lengthen the time taken.",

There are no legal standards for cleanliness other than visual, although a range of guidelines has been proposed. These vary (Table 44 .9) and often their derivation is unclear but are usually based upon an often erroneous perception of risk or what is acceptable. Due to lack of data for risk assessment an alternative strategy is to decide what is attainable after correct implementation of a well-designed cleaning program. However, variability can undermine confidence in sampling results (Downey et al., 2012) . <500 RLUs Applies to use of one specific ATP test/equipment combination Target Mossel, D.A.A., Jansen, J.T., Struijk, C.B., 1999 . Microbiological safety assurance applied to smaller catering operations world-wide. Food Control 10, 195-211. f Swedish Food Agency, 1998. The Swedish Statute Book. SLV SFS, 10. Sources of variation need to be controlled (Moore and Griffith, 2007) and variability needs to be considered in setting guidelines and within the context of risk. Validation work (ie, when a cleaning protocol is first formulated) should involve extensive sampling and be considered within the framework of a statistically based trend analysis approach. One approach, used for ATP, is to determine the mean value (n = minimum of 10) considered as clean, for a surface and apply a fail value of the mean plus 3 times the standard deviation. Values between the mean and fail levels can be considered as cautionary or marginally acceptable. Studies on a wide range of over 10,000 surfaces Moore and Griffith, 2007; Lewis et al., 2008; Redmond et al., 2009) indicate that in most cases, levels of <2.5 CFU/cm 2 for a general surface count are attainable. This is relatively close to some suggested guidelines, although up to 10 CFU/cm 2 is considered acceptable by some (Table 44 .9; NSW Food Authority, 2012). Failure to achieve this level of cleanliness or disinfection may mean the cleaning protocol is poorly constructed, is not implemented well, unclean materials are used, or the surface is in poor condition/cannot be satisfactorily cleaned.",

However, in isolation, visual assessment is not a good indicator of surface cleanliness and, therefore, any decision about further testing needs to be considered in relation to product risk as well as the availability of other tests and the types of food soil. One or more types of rapid testing, for example, ATP, can be combined with microbiological methods to determine the effectiveness of surface cleaning and disinfection. Additionally, both microbiological and nonmicrobiological tests have value in validating the original cleaning program and investigating the reasons for any failure to clean effectively (Table 44 .10). Rapid tests can be used after cleaning, prior to disinfection, to determine whether the surfaces are sufficiently free of soiling to enable successful disinfection. They can also help to identify areas difficult to clean or routinely poorly cleaned, thus indicating where microbiological testing is most useful. This type of integrated approach provides a better indication of cleaning efficacy, helps to provide transparency, and demonstrates a company's concern for effective cleaning. Additionally, it has the potential to save on cleaning costs by identifying what is, or is not, effective or necessary.",

When and where to monitor (Table 44 .11) needs to be considered in relation to surface type, risk, and the potential for cross-contamination, the type of information required and the reasons for sampling. Firms should construct an appropriate environmental sampling plan, this should specify the approaches, methods, numbers, and types of sample for each location and a results communication strategy. This helps to provide a consistent approach to routine sampling but should also give flexibility and allow for investigative or nonroutine sampling based on observations of poor cleaning practices/results, product problems, or the need to adopt a \"seek and destroy\" approach (Butts, 2003; Malley et al., 2015) . It is important that the results of any testing are communicated to the correct people. Poor/noncommunication of results was partly responsible for at least one major outbreak of listeriosis, where positive L. monocytogenes isolations were not reported to senior management (Weatherill, 2009 ). It is unfortunate that in some companies, sampling concentrates on the center of large flat surfaces. Easier-to-sample surfaces are usually easier to clean and so are clean, hard-to-sample surfaces are often more difficult to clean and may be less well cleaned or overlooked. Less attention may be given to hand-contact surfaces or cracks and crevices where soil and later microorganisms can accumulate. Hand-contact surfaces in particular are known to be often heavily contaminated and frequently touched prior to handling RTE foods (Clayton and Griffith, 2004; Griffith, 2013) .

Barriers to the high hygiene area (eg, personnel entry areas, product decontamination entry tunnels, packaging entrances) are sampled for pathogens during production. If pathogens are found, the control of the barriers is checked. As an indication of whether pathogens are present during manufacturing periods, pathogen \"collector points\" (eg, cleaning equipment, drains, footwear, vehicle wheels) are sampled during production. If these are negative, there is some confidence that the production area is free of pathogens. If positive, extended sampling can then be undertaken to elucidate the pathogen source. Finally, cleaned equipment is sampled for pathogens to verify cleaning and disinfectant performance.",

Cleaning audits (internal or external) should be conducted independently and assess both the quality and adequacy of the cleaning program and the level of compliance with it. Personal digital assistants (PDA), palm-held auditing tools with appropriate software, or smartphones are available to capture data electronically. They simplify the whole process and can incorporate data from microbiological or rapid testing. One advantage of capturing data electronically is that draft reports can be produced, if necessary, before the auditor leaves the areas/premises being audited. Data in an electronic form are far more useful and usable than those in paper reports. Other advantages include greater consistency, overall time savings, and greater usability of data for analyzing trends and designing corrective strategies. These become even more powerful if combined with cross-contamination audits, which are broader in scope, and used to assess the overall risk or potential for crosscontamination. The latter assess more than just cleaning, and include personal hygiene, facilities available, for example, hand-washing and drying, traffic, and personnel flow. Monitoring surface cleanliness is not without costs but these need to be considered in relation to the costs associated with failing to monitor (Fig. 44.10) .",

It can also identify areas where cleaning is often/ regularly poorly performed, staff who are not cleaning appropriately, effectiveness of changes in cleaning practices, and when cleaning is starting to go/has gone \"out of control.\" Monitoring should therefore be based on regular consistent testing coupled with trend analysis and requires that all results are considered (not just the ones considered unacceptable) as good results can also be informative. Results to look for are outliers-Is this a test anomaly or can some other event explain the difference? Is there a consistent change in results-Has a new cleaning chemical or methods been used?

This has coincided with the emergence of a number of pathogens with a low infectious dose. Therefore the need for surface testing as a means to assess cleaning efficiency has increased and will further increase due to its proactive potential to ensure food does not become contaminated in the first place (as opposed to end-product testing, which tells you something may or may not have happened). Tests for surface cleanliness will evolve to meet changing requirements in how they are used, how they can be integrated into an holistic approach, considered in relation to developments in legislation, reference values, audit standards, and other needs.",

This may be in isolation or in combination with tests for the presence of specific pathogens. The ability to detect lower levels of ATP has developed over recent years with, depending upon the reagents and how they are produced, the ability to detect below 1 fmol of ATP. ATP or microbiological tests, specific and sensitive enough to detect very low levels of bacteria or ATP, even in dry conditions, could be developed. New formats, other than swabs, may be devised.
