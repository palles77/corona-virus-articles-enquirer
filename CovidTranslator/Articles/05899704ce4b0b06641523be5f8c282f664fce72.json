It raises serious questions for the future.

Translocation of lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase in response to gonadotropinreleasing hormone to the plasma membrane in ovarian cancer cell 143 Wen-Shu Sun, PhD, Atsushi Imai, MD, Michiyo Sugiyama, MD, Tatsuro Furui, MD, Teruhiko Tamaya, MD, Masanao Saio, MD, Andrew J. Morris, PhD Gifu, Japan, and Chapel Hill, NC Gonadotropin-releasing hormone-induced translocation of lipid phosphate phosphatase type 3 may contribute to the majority of lysophosphatidic acid loss at the level of plasma membrane in gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor-expressing ovarian carcinoma.
