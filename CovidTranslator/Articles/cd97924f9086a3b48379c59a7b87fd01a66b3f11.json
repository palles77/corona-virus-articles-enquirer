            "text": "All positive-strand RNA viruses replicate their genomes in association with rearranged intracellular membranes such as singleor double-membrane vesicles. Brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNA synthesis occurs in vesicular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane invaginations, each induced by many copies of viral replication protein 1a, which has N-terminal RNA capping and C-terminal helicase domains. Although the capping domain is responsible for 1a membrane association and ER targeting, neither this domain nor the helicase domain was sufficient to induce replication vesicle formation. Moreover, despite their potential for mutual interaction, the capping and helicase domains showed no complementation when coexpressed in trans. Crosslinking showed that the capping and helicase domains each form trimers and larger multimers in vivo, and the capping domain formed extended, stacked, hexagonal lattices in vivo. Furthermore, coexpressing the capping domain blocked the ability of fulllength 1a to form replication vesicles and replicate RNA and recruited full-length 1a into mixed hexagonal lattices with the capping domain. Thus, BMV replication vesicle formation and RNA replication depend on the direct linkage and concerted action of 1a's self-interacting capping and helicase domains. In particular, the capping domain's strong dominant-negative effects showed that the ability of full-length 1a to form replication vesicles was highly sensitive to disruption by non-productively titrating lattice-forming self-interactions of the capping domain. These and other findings shed light on the roles and interactions of 1a domains in replication compartment formation and support prior results suggesting that 1a induces replication vesicles by forming a capsid-like interior shell.",

The roles of 1a and 2a pol in the assembly and function of these spherule replication compartments have parallels to those of Gag and Pol in the membrane-enveloped capsids of retrovirus virions (1, 50) . Such retrovirus capsids are composed of hexameric arrays of Gag that curve to closure by incorporating pentameric (16) or gap (7) discontinuities. The high multiplicity of 1a in spherules (50) and its strong membrane association (10) and selfinteraction (40) suggest that 1a might induce membrane invagination by forming a capsid-like shell similar to that of Gag. Consistent with this, confocal fluorescence shows that 1a accumulates in discrete, expanding ER patches during infection, implying that extended 1a-1a interactions occur in vivo on ER membranes (48) . Similarly, replicase proteins from many other positive-strand RNA viruses can also multimerize (13, 19, 34, 41, 57) . For example, the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) 126-kDa protein, a 1a homolog, contains a helicase domain that forms hexamers (19) .",

            "text": "Linked RNA capping and helicase domains homologous to those of 1a are conserved across the alphavirus-like superfamily, but in some superfamily members, such as Sindbis and Semliki Forest viruses, the nonstructural proteins are translated as a polyprotein and are ultimately proteolytically processed into two separate proteins (56) . For Sindbis virus and Semliki Forest virus, formation of the membrane spherules is induced by the partially processed nonstructural protein P123 and nsp4; however, synthesis of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is an essential prerequisite of their formation (14, 52) . To shed further light on the roles and interactions of these domains, we expressed BMV 1a capping and helicase domains alone, together, or in combination with fulllength 1a and used confocal and electron microscopy (EM) and complementary biochemical methods to assess the effects on membrane targeting, membrane rearrangement, and RNA replication. We show that spherular replication compartment formation and RNA replication require both the 1a capping and helicase domains and that these domains must be directly linked. Nevertheless, in vivo, the 1a capping domain alone targeted ER membranes, formed membrane-linked hexagonal lattices of tubules or stacked rings, and induced layering of ER double membranes. Additionally, the capping domain had strong dominant-negative effects on full-length 1a, blocking 1a's induction of spherular replication compartments and RNA replication and instead recruiting 1a into a hexagonal lattice. The 1a helicase domain failed to associate with membranes by itself but was recruited by full-length 1a to the ER, without interfering with spherule formation or RNA replication. These results provide new mechanistic insights into 1a domains and interactions involved in BMV RNA replication complexes and in RNA replication.",

To track the contributions of the capping (CAP) and helicase-like (HEL) domains of 1a to ER membrane association and reorganization, we divided 1a into two fragments. This division is similar to that of the final processed forms of alphavirus nonstructural proteins nsP1 and nsP2, which have RNA capping and NTPase/helicase activities, respectively (4, 18) . nsP1, which is a peripheral membrane protein, acts as the sole membrane anchor of the replication complex (5) . The CAP fragment contains the capping domain and a short proline-rich linker region, while the HEL fragment contains the NTPase/helicase domain (Fig. 1A) . The CAP and HEL fragments each contain all sequences previously shown by yeast two-hybrid analysis to be required for CAP-CAP and intramolecular CAP-HEL interaction (40) . Additionally, Escherichia coli-expressed and purified derivatives of CAP (aa 1 to 516) and HEL (aa 424 to 961) retain the ability to form an adduct with a guanine nucleotide (2, 30) and to hydrolyze ATP (58), respectively. Thus, both fragments maintain a structural conformation consistent with their function within full-length 1a. We first used confocal immunofluorescence microscopy to compare the subcellular localization of CAP and HEL with that of fulllength 1a. 1a localized predominantly to the perinuclear ER, colocalizing almost completely with the Sec63-GFP ER marker (Fig.  1B) . Likewise, CAP colocalized with Sec63-GFP, although only a portion of CAP was in the perinuclear ER whereas the rest formed wisp-like structures that extended into the cytoplasm (Fig. 1B) . In contrast, HEL did not colocalize with Sec63-GFP and displayed a mostly diffused cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 1B) .",

Close examination indicated that each ring consisted of six \u03f34to 5-nm-diameter dense objects clustered in a closely packed arrangement (Fig. 2E , inset). The individual appearances and center-to-center distance of two neighboring rings of 24.2 \u03ee 1.7 nm were similar to those of the single rows of rings sandwiched between double-membrane ER layers (compare Fig. 2E with Fig. 2C ). In the hexagonal arrays, though, the great majority of \u03f314-nm rings were directly surrounded on six sides by other rings, without immediately flanking ER membranes; nevertheless, at least one edge of these hexagonal lattices was often flanked by membrane (Fig. 2E , arrowheads; the membrane appears grayish, as it was partially extracted). Moreover, occasionally ER-like, closely appressed double-membrane layers a few hundred nanometers in length invaded the lattice to isolate on each side a single row of rings (Fig. 2F , arrowheads) that appeared locally indistinguishable from the perinuclear, ER- sandwiched single rows of rings (Fig. 2C) . However, at the point where these membrane protrusions ended, the row of rings so isolated melded apparently seamlessly into the surrounding hexagonal lattice of rings, which also flowed around and abutted the outer face of the isolating double membrane protrusion (Fig. 2F , arrows). This intersection of the two ultrastructural forms further underscored the similarities and potentially related nature of the \u03f317-nm rings in each case. Higher-magnification micrographs showed that adjacent rings in the hexagonal lattice were frequently connected by filamentous material, perhaps explaining the regular \u03f37-nm spacing separating each ring (Fig. 2E, inset) .",

The nature and intermediates of this transition imply that the ordered rings represent perpendicular sections through an array of tubules. Though locally ordered in parallel arrays, a degree of flexibility in the array apparently allows the tubule angle to shift gradually across the hundreds of tubules in an EM field. Thus, as seen in Fig. 3 , the view gradually shifts from perpendicular sections of tubules (region i; ordered, separated rings) to tubules sectioned at more oblique angles, revealing elongated, apparently stacked rings (region ii) and, eventually, tubules sectioned parallel to their main axis (region iii; striations).",

In cells expressing the CAP fragment only, 85% of all of the gold particles were in or on the rings surrounding the nucleus or in the hexagonal arrays, while only 8% were in the electron-lucent regions (Fig. 4A) . Similarly, in sections displaying the laminar or \"side\" views of the tubules, 80% of all of the gold particles were in or on the electron-dense spaces between the ex-tracted membranes (Fig. 4B ). Another 10% of the gold particles were present within 10 to 20 nm of the electron-dense tubules, a distance that may be spanned by the primary and secondary antibodies linking the immunogold particles to their target epitopes (22) . Notably, the ring/tubular structures remained intact despite lipid extraction due to the lack of osmium tetroxide fixation, further suggesting that they are mainly composed of proteins. Consistent with this, the homogeneity in the size of the rings suggests that they are made of components of a defined, consistent size. Taken together, these results suggest that CAP is the main component of the rings, but we cannot exclude the possibility that cellular components might be present as well.",

Since CAP was found not only in regular perinuclear ER but also in wisp-like extensions also labeled with the ER marker Sec63 (Fig. 1B) , we wanted to determine whether formation of the CAP-induced tubules also increased total lipid levels. To test this, we used gasliquid chromatography to analyze the fatty acid (FA) levels in yeast expressing empty plasmids, 1a, or CAP. As there were no significant changes in the relative compositions of individual lipid species, we compared total FA levels per cell by summing the molar amounts of various FA for each culture and expressing the resulting total FA value as a percentage of that of yeast transformed with empty plasmids. Agreeing with previous results, 1a expression increased total FA levels per cell by 33% (Fig. 5) . Since 95% of all FA in yeast exist as fatty acyl chains of membrane lipids, total FA levels reflect yeast membrane content (46) and the 1a-induced increase in FA must represent an increase in membrane content. CAP expression increased total FA accumulation by 60% (Fig. 5) . Thus, the increase in total FA accumulation must reflect the presence of double-membrane layers surrounding the ring/tubular structures, consistent with the confocal microscopy images that show that the 1a fragments colocalize with the ER marker Sec63 throughout (Fig. 1) .",

Prior yeast two-hybrid results showed that CAP and HEL can self-interact but did not address the level of this multimerization or reveal any HEL-HEL interaction (40) . The formation of extended ring/tubule structures by CAP suggested that 1a fragments might multimerize to a high level. To address this, we used chemical cross-linking to examine the multimerization states of 1a, CAP, and HEL. Full-length 1a was used as a control, since yeast two-hybrid results show that 1a can self-interact (40) . After cultures were treated with formaldehyde to cross-link any protein complexes, proteins were extracted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting using anti-1a antibodies. In yeast expressing full-length 1a, we detected a major band migrating as expected for a 1a monomer (109 kDa), and this band was weaker in the formaldehyde-treated samples than in nontreated samples (Fig. 6A ). Additionally, crosslinking caused the appearance of an SDS-resistant, 1a-containing band that electrophoresed to a position corresponding to a 1a trimer plus a higher-molecular-mass band that migrated more slowly than the 460-kDa marker, suggesting that the in vivo chemical cross-linking stabilized the higher-molecular-mass 1acontaining complexes during lysis and/or electrophoresis (Fig.  6A) . Similarly, in yeast expressing CAP, a \"ladder\" of cross-linked bands whose molecular sizes were consistent with monomers and SDS-resistant trimers and hexamers became apparent (Fig. 6A) .",

Most positive-strand RNA viruses encode multiple factors required for RNA replication, expressed from discrete open reading frames (ORFs) either by proteolytic cleavage of a single polyprotein or by readthrough or frameshift translation (56) . For example, the nonstructural proteins of alphaviruses, including the nsP1 capping and nsP2 helicase proteins that are related to the 1a CAP and HEL fragments, are synthesized as polyprotein precursors that are then cleaved into individual components (56) . Western blotting of yeast cells expressing 1a or CAP plus HEL showed that, when coexpressed in trans, the levels of CAP and HEL are very similar to those of full-length 1a (Fig.  7A ). Accordingly, we tested whether the CAP and HEL fragments, coexpressed in trans, could complement each other to substitute for full-length 1a in replicating BMV RNA. In cells expressing BMV 1a and 2a pol proteins, RNA3 is used as a template to make negative-strand RNA3, which is then used to make positive-strand RNA3 and subgenomic RNA4 (25) . Yeast cells expressing 1a, 2a pol , and RNA3 supported efficient viral RNA replication (Fig.  7B ). In contrast, in cells expressing 2a pol , RNA3, CAP, and HEL, RNA3 was not detectably amplified (Fig. 7B) .",

Moreover, although CAP and HEL each contained all sequences required for enzymatic activity (2, 30, 58) , self-interaction ( Fig. 2 and 6) , and CAP-HEL interaction (40) , coexpressing CAP and HEL also did not support spherule formation, stabilize RNA3 templates, or replicate the viral RNA (Fig. 7) . Thus, CAP and HEL and their direct linkage are all essential for spherule formation and RNA replication. This inability of separately expressed CAP and HEL to function synergistically in RNA replication is consistent with the failure of CAP to recruit HEL to ER membranes (Fig. 7D) , and both findings are consistent with prior two-hybrid results implying that HEL and CAP can interact intramolecularly within full-length 1a but do not significantly interact intermolecularly between two 1a's (40) . Among other functions, forming membrane-bounded replication compartments may require a direct linkage to allow CAP-HEL intramolecular interaction (40) and cooperation between CAP and HEL self-interactions (see also below) or for 1amediated recruitment of relevant host factors (12) . Since CAP targets ER membranes whereas HEL interacts with BMV 2a pol (26, 48) and BMV RNA (58), CAP-HEL linkage is also required to recruit BMV RNA polymerase and replication templates and likely also for later 1a-mediated steps in RNA replication such as RNA capping (2, 30) .",

Yeast two-hybrid assays revealed self-interaction of the 1a CAP domain and established the close connection of this interaction with RNA replication (40) but did not address the level of CAP multimerization. Our cross-linking results show that CAP self-interacts in vivo to form at least trimers and hexamers (Fig. 6A) . Full-length 1a also formed trimers and higher-molecular-mass complexes (Fig. 6A) . In vivo, CAP also induced two striking, related structures that appeared to differ only in the balance of CAP-CAP and CAPmembrane interactions. These were single rows of regularly spaced, parallel, \u03f317-nm-diameter tubules flanked on either side by the ER membrane (Fig. 2F ) and masses of similar parallel tubules, interlinked by \u03f37-nm radial filaments into a hexagonal lattice and bounded at the edges only by flanking ER membranes ( Fig. 2C and H) . The relationship of these structures suggests that each face of the CAP-induced tubules is capable of a mutually exclusive interaction either with an ER membrane or with another tubule.",

Thus, the CAP fragment interacts with 1a as a strong dominant-negative mutant, and its titration of the lattice-forming interaction sites in 1a blocks spherule formation. Together, these results show that the CAP interactions that form the hexagonal lattice are highly relevant for spherule formation and RNA replication. Further strengthening this conclusion, a mutation that had been previously shown to affect spherule formation in the context of full-length 1a (33) correlated with an inhibition of tubule formation in the context of the CAP fragment (Fig. 10D) . However, a different mutation that resulted in an increase in spherule formation in the context of full-length 1a (33) did not enhance the ability of CAP to make more hexagonal tubule lattices than wt CAP (Fig. 10E) .",

Accordingly, the tubules' hexagonal arrangement ( Fig. 2A, 2G, and 3 ) and potentially hexameric individual crosssections (Fig. 2G, inset) , plus CAP cross-linking to multimers that electrophorese as trimers and hexamers ( Fig. 6A and B) , suggest that the tubules might be built partly or largely from hexameric rings of CAP subunits. Since each CAP subunit would be \u03f35 to 6 nm in diameter if globular, a hexamer of CAP subunits is consistent with the tubule ring cross-section (Fig. 2G inset) , while, along the tubule length, periodic intertubule connections (Fig. 2D ) and density variations (Fig. 3, top panel, inset) are consistent with the stacking of such rings to form the tubules. However, membranes appear to be an important component of the tubules/rings, as CAP expression led to a 66% increase in total lipid accumulation per cell (Fig. 5) . The ability of CAP to modulate an increase in total lipid levels is understandable, as CAP is present on the membrane at high local concentrations, interacts with itself (Fig. 6) , and accumulates on ER membranes (Fig. 1B) . In this context, the greater increase in FA accumulation upon expression of CAP compared to full-length 1a might be due to the greater surface area the tubules occupy within the cell compared to spherules (compare the Sec63-GFP signals in Fig. 1B in cells expressing full-length 1a to those in cells expressing CAP).",

            "text": "Relation of CAP multimerization to spherule vesicle formation. Localization and stoichiometry results imply that the membrane-bound, self-interacting 1a protein forms a shell lining BMV RNA replication vesicles (1, 50) . Such a capsid-like shell would explain how 1a induces and maintains these replication vesicles. Related findings support the idea of a similar role for transmembrane, self-interacting FHV protein A in lining the mitochondrial FHV RNA replication vesicles (31) . To form such a membrane-bending shell, 1a would need to use regular interactions to assemble a connected matrix such as the hexagonal arrays formed by retrovirus and other capsid proteins (7, 15) . The CAPinduced hexagonal lattice ( Fig. 2 and 3) shows that CAP is capable of such repeated interactions (Fig. 2G) . As a membrane binding, self-interacting protein that participates in invaginating membranes, CAP also has similarities to virion matrix proteins, including particular parallels with Marburg virus matrix protein VP40. In virions, such matrix proteins form a hexagonal lattice parallel to the membrane (17, 45, 49) , but when VP40's N-terminal domain is expressed alone, its hexameric rings stack into tubules similar to those formed by the 1a CAP fragment (55) . Thus, the interlinked CAP-induced tubules might similarly be built from CAP multimers and CAP interactions involved in forming normal replication compartments but whose final assembly would be perturbed for lack of guidance from other interactions mediated by the normally linked HEL domain (see also below).",

Furthermore, our cross-linking results showed that HEL selfinteracts to form trimers and larger complexes, including potential hexamers (Fig. 6) . Intriguingly, like CAP, many helicases form hexamers (43) , including the helicase domain of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) 126-kDa protein (19) , a 1a homolog (21) .

Thus, in CAP and HEL, 1a contains two self-interacting, potentially hexamer-forming domains required for 1a-induced membrane invagination. This parallels the HIV capsid protein, which contains separately interacting regions that form two stacked hexamer rings whose size mismatch is thought to induce the Gag lattice and bound membrane to curve (7) .
