Over the past decades the application of dynamic modelling and control has aided understanding of the complexities of their dynamics and control.

In turn this has informed the design of a number of closed-loop control mechanisms that are now being developed to support the diabetic patient in controlling their blood glucose levels.

This implies that technological developments need to be directed towards correct treatment at the right place and at the right time.

The question remains, however, how this information can be used to control the crop as a whole. The solution to this question is related to natural variation between plants, and to spatial distributions. The latter problem is attacked now by advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques (Reichrath & Davies, 2002) . In relation to water, individual ions can be measured with ion-selective electrodes, thus allowing accurate feedback control to satisfy the demand of the plant (Sigrimis, Arvanitis, Pasgianos, & Ferentinos, 2001 ; van Straten & Gieling, 2004) . As to the control itself, optimal control methodology now allows for economically optimal control, The bottle-neck here is the lack of sufficiently accurate crop quality models, although some progress has been made in a number of areas. A model for nitrate in lettuce has been used, for instance, to control the nitrate content of the head at harvest time (de Graaf et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "Gerrit van Straten received his MSc at Eindhoven University (Chemical Engineering), The Netherlands. From 1972 to 1978 he was assistant professor in sanitary engineering at Twente University. In 1978-1979 he was visiting scholar and project leader at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria. After this period he became Associate Professor and leader of the Environmental Systems Group at Twente. He received a PhD degree from Twente University in 1986 on a thesis 'Identification, uncertainty assessment and prediction in lake eutrophication'. In 1990, he became full professor at Wageningen University, where he leads the Systems and Control Group. Apart from being author and editor of several books and proceedings he published over 130 research papers advocating the use of systems modelling and control in a broad spectrum of applications in agriculture, food processing and environmental technology, with special emphasis on greenhouse cultivation control. He received the IFAC Outstanding Contribution Award, and is currently the Chair of the IFAC TC on Control in Agriculture.",
