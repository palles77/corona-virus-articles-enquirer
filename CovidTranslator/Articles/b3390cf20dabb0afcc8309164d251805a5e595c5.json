            "text": "The enzyme calpain is a Ca 2+ -dependent protease that participates in the execution of apoptotic and necrotic forms of cell death (Lankiewicz et al., 2000; Goll et al., 2003; Tan et al., 2006) . Calpain overactivation is a feature of numerous neurodegenerative conditions, including ischemia/reperfusion brain injury (Markgraf et al., 1998) , Parkinson's disease (Crocker et al., 2003) , Huntington's disease (Gafni and Ellerby, 2002) , and Alzheimer's disease (Saito et al., 1993) . Modification of calpain activity via specific inhibitors provides a potential method of therapeutic intervention in such cases. In addition, the mechanisms, time course, and spatial distribution of calpain activation is poorly understood and is normally inferred from immunodetection of a single calpain breakdown product, such as cleaved a-spectrin. A prime complication to developing effective assays for this enzyme is that it cleaves a variety of substrate proteins of little obvious sequence similarity. It is believed that calpain substrates are targeted primarily by recognition of loop sequences on protein surfaces. For these reasons the development of a useful probe for kinetic detection of calpain activity in cells is both an important and challenging problem. A variety of fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) substrates have been advocated as suitable probes (Mittoo et al., 2003; Tompa et al., 2004; Cuerrier et al., 2005) , but these fall far short of the specified criteria.",

A particularly advantageous feature is the readiness of the BHQ quencher, paired with a variety of fluorophores, to adopt ground state complexes, involving a close interaction of the chromophores. This results in highly efficient quenching (Johanssen et al., 2002) . The CAL Fluor Orange 560 fluorophore was selected because (1) the Ex/Em values (540/561 nm) are well suited to the optical system of the laser scanning confocal microscope employed, and (2) it allows for simultaneous monitoring of other cellular parameters (e.g. intracellular Ca 2+ ) using fluorescent reporters that are excited at shorter wavelengths. A small fluorogenic substrate library was prepared with the CAL Fluor Orange 560/BHQ-2 fluorophore/quencher pair; it comprised calpain cleavage sequences derived from cellular substrates as well as previously described artificial peptide substrates. These probes were then analyzed in vitro for calpain susceptibility and specificity. Further modification has lead to specific cell permeable probes that allow for investigation of calpain activation in cells.",

CAL Fluor dyes provide chemically and enzymatically stable, isomer free variants of standard xanthene dyes. CAL Fluor Orange 560 (Fig. 1 , hereafter referred to by the abbreviation CFO) is available with a variety of biocompatible aliphatic spacer arm selections, as shown, and described elsewhere (Reddington and Lyttle, 2005 ). An isosteric version of the ''short'' spacer CFO-1 dye (designated as CFO-u1) is incorporated by a urethane bond (formed with a pnitrophenyl carbonate precursor). Additionally, this variation has been incorporated via the corresponding Fmoc-Lys(CFO-u1)-OH derivative, which allows extension or modification to the amino terminus of the construct. The dye carboxylate forms (CFO-1, CFO-3) are preferentially attached via DIPCDI/HOAt-mediated coupling, although HATU and other reagents are also effective (Carpino et al., 1994 ). An important previous publication (Tompa et al., 2004) derived, from several calpain cleavage sites within natural proteins, a ''hybrid'' form that was believed to be an optimal, stable and specific substrate (designated cB when provided in our format). The Bradley group (Mittoo et al., 2003) developed a substrate based on the a-spectrin calpain cleavage site, whereas a peptide library screening approach arrived at yet another substrate that was deemed kinetically superior to previous designs (Cuerrier, 2005) . A selection of these and other known cleavagesusceptible sequences of proteins were synthesized in CFO-1/BHQ-2 FRET format; Table I shows a partial listing of the most interesting of these targets. These peptides were assessed as calpain substrates, analyzed for their stability to chymotrypsin and trypsin, two of the major proteolytic activities of the cellular proteasome, and tested for the signal/noise ratio (S/N, the ratio of any fluorescence signal (S), to the background Signal, N, measured in wells lacking digesting enzyme; a measure of expected assay sensitivity) obtained on complete digestion by the poorly specific Pronase E protease mixture.",

The first modification was by addition of a 27-atom C-terminal PEG extension (Cook et al., 1994) , which could conveniently be incorporated in this format by a simple two-step route (Rose and Vizzavona, 1999) . The second variation was by addition of D-Ala-Arg (aR). A similar solubility-improving ruse (by addition of RRK tails) has been used in substrate libraries (Thomas et al., 2006) . The PEG modification appeared highly compatible with in vitro assays, whereas aR forms proved to give inferior results. The variant of cG which incorporated the aR C-terminus and Ac-K(CFO-u1) at the N-terminus was a very poor probe, indeed ( Table I) . Both of these C-terminal modifications proved to inhibit membrane transport. Formal interchange of dye and quencher was equally undesirable (data not shown). On the basis of the high stability of cA and cJ to potentially non-specific enzymatic activities, these substrates were initially chosen for evaluation in cells. cA, but not cJ, proved to enter cells without the addition of a transporter sequence, and fluorescence was observed upon activation of calpain pathways by the addition of the calcium ionophore ionomycin (Fig. 2a , full characterization of cA is to be published elsewhere). Of even greater interest, there was no obvious decline in signal after 2 h (data not shown), suggesting that on cleavage the fluorescent fragment generated in the cell is rendered incapable of crossing the membrane. In support of this idea, the synthetic peptide CFO-GSG-OH (corresponding to the predicted fluorescent cleavage product) was found to be cell impermeable (Fig. 2b) . A further non-quenched analog of cA was prepared with K(BHQ-2) replaced by norleucine, a formal elimination of the epsilon N and BHQ moieties. Remarkably, this peptide also could not enter cells. These findings strongly suggest that the BHQ-2 modification is actively involved in transporting the probe across the membrane. On cleavage, the CFO fragment then lacks this transport facilitating feature, and is retained. It is also noteworthy that introduction of the known HIV tat protein Arg-rich transporter sequence, GRKKRRQRRRPQ (Vives et al., 1997) , as a C-terminal extension to cA, produced a variant which afforded an approx. 5\u00c2 greater sensitivity of detection in cell assays (data not shown).",

Improved stability to chymotrypsin was expected for G, L, V (cXa to cXc), or cyclohexyl-alanine (cXi) variants ( Fig. 5a-c, g) . cXa was rather similar as a calpain substrate to its parent, but its chymotrypsin lability was affected remarkably little. Substitution with chA (cXi) also had little effect on proteolysis by either enzyme (Fig. 5g) , whereas Val in this position dramatically reduced the effectiveness of calpain processing (cXc, Fig. 5c ). cXb, the Phe transformed to Leu analog, was at least as an effective calpain substrate as its parent, with considerably improved chymotryptic stability (Fig. 5b) . Optimization of this series was completed by examining the effect of modifying the CAL Fluor dye composition of cXb by variations of the CFO linker component. This phase was embarked on with no great expectations, since all versions were known to be stable to chymotrypsin, either in the native dye, or when attached to substrates. Indeed, cXf afforded little improvement (Fig. 5g ), but cXg ( Fig. 5f ) was significantly improved. cXe, bearing the CFO-3 variation (Fig. 1) , attached by a far longer spacer, proved not only very much more stable to chymotrypsin but was also an improved calpain substrate (Fig. 5d depicts the kinetic profiles shown by the three enzymes). The reason for the improved chymotrypsin stability of cXe is unclear. The observation that all peptides shown in Table II give very high S/N values, whatever the sequence or form of the CFO dyes, suggests that all adopt a ground state complex in which the dye and quencher are in close proximity. This form results in efficient static quenching that augments the standard dynamic Forster effect (which on its own decreases dramatically with increasing separation). It is tempting to speculate that the longer flexible CFO-3 spacer incorporated in cXe promotes formation of a calpain-preferred/ chymotrypsin unfavorable conformation of the substrate peptide.",

However, individual cells accumulated cXe to different degrees and cXe fluorescence in some cells could only be visualized by increasing the laser intensity. While it is possible that cell-to-cell variation in cXe fluorescence reflects a difference in the level of basal protease activity, we observed similar signal variability of permanently labeled fluorescent peptides (data not shown). This suggests that there are intrinsic differences in the ability of individual cells to accumulate exogenous peptides. Continuing studies are examining the effects of C-terminal modifications to enhance cell permeability of cA and cXe. Detailed studies are also proceeding on the effectiveness of these probes in identifying calpain activity in cells in response to various stimuli. Results are still preliminary and will be reported elsewhere.",
