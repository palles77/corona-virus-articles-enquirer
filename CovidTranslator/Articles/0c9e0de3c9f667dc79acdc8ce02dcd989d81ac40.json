Once cultured in Transwells, Calu-3 LCC must be handled with care. Irregular media changes and mechanical or physical disruption of the cell layers or plates negatively impact polarization for several hours or days. Polarization is monitored by evaluating transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and is verified by evaluating the passive equilibration of sodium fluorescein between the apical and basolateral compartments 17, 18 .

Using sterile forceps, move Transwell inserts from the interior to the exterior rows of the plate without touching the insert membrane. Cells should only be subcultured into wells on the exterior rows of the plate. To prevent the introduction of air bubbles into the basolateral compartments, add 600 \u03bcl of EMEM-10% to each one by angling the pipette against the wall of each compartment and slowly releasing the medium into the well. 3. Detach cells from T-75 cm 2 tissue. Subculture flasks using warmed trypsin, and wash in 30 ml of EMEM-20%+S per every 2 flasks of trypsinized cells, as described in step 1.2. 4. Thoroughly resuspend the washed cells in 5 ml of EMEM-10% by gently pipetting up and down. 5. Determine viable and total cell counts by the trypan blue exclusion method. Proceed only if 80% -90% are viable. 6. In a 50 ml sterile conical tube, dilute cells to a concentration of 2 \u00d7 10 6 viable cells/ml with EMEM-10%. 7 . Add cells to the apical compartment of each Transwell. To wells A1 and D1, which will be cell-free control wells, that is, blanks, add 100 \u03bcl of EMEM-10% without cells. To each of the remaining wells, add 100 \u03bcl of resuspended Calu-3 cells, gently angling the pipette against the interior guide channel of the insert wall and slowly releasing the cells. Do not touch the pipette to the insert membrane. To maintain a homogeneous suspension of Calu-3 cells, gently agitate the cell suspension during this seeding step. 8. Incubate Transwell plate at 37 \u00b0C and 7% CO 2 in air atmosphere. Place plate in an incubator where physical disturbance will be minimal. To improve the efficiency of polarization, do not stack plates on top of each other. 9. To maintain cultures until polarized and ready to use in experiments, completely replace medium in Transwells, as described in steps 2.10 through 2.13 below. Medium should be completely replaced three days after being subcultured into Transwells, and then on a cycle alternating between the fourth and then third day after the previous feeding, until cells are fully polarized. 10. Warm EMEM-10% in a water bath to 37 \u00b0C. 11. Gently aspirate medium from Transwell inserts. With a capillary pipette attached to a vacuum trap with a gentle vacuum, or with a standard 1 ml pipette, aspirate medium from cell-free wells A1 and D1, then from seeded wells, first removing apical medium from all wells, and then removing basolateral medium from all wells. Do not touch insert membranes while aspirating medium. 12. Add 200 \u03bcl of EMEM-10% to the apical compartment of cell-free wells A1 and D1, then to the seeded wells, directing the medium into the apical compartment using the side of the insert to guide the pipette tip. Do not add medium directly onto cells, and do not touch the insert membrane. 13. Add 600 \u03bcl of EMEM-10% to the basolateral compartments.

            "text": "When grown as liquid-covered cultures (LCC) in Transwell culture systems, as illustrated in Figure 1 , Calu-3 cells polarize, developing distinct apical and basolateral surfaces. Following the method described here, the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of Calu-3 LCC reaches a plateau at or above 1,000 \u03a9\u00d7cm 2 within 3 weeks after seeding, an example of which is shown in Figure 2 . The tight junctions formed between polarized cells prevent passive equilibration of small molecules between the apical and basolateral compartments. Thus, a modified sodium fluorescein equilibration assay is used to confirm polarization of Calu-3 LCC 15, 17, 18 . As the TEER of Calu-3 cell monolayers in LCC increases, the amount of fluorescein that passively equilibrates into the basolateral compartment decreases. Once the TEER is 1,000 \u03a9\u00d7cm 2 , the amount of fluorescein that equilibrates into the basolateral compartment is \u2264 1%, as shown in Figure 3 ; therefore, Calu-3 LCC are considered to be fully polarized when the TEER is \u2265 1,000 \u03a9\u00d7cm 2 . The peak TEER measurement of Calu-3 LCC may vary from experiment to experiment. However, once TEER values plateau for any given experiment, a fully polarized, uninfected Calu-3 LCC may be stable for 5 through 12 weeks postseeding. Absence of resistance development in Transwell-cultured Calu-3 may be caused by several factors as outlined in Table 1 . Once the TEER of Calu-3 LCC plateaus at or above 1,000 \u03a9\u00d7cm 2 , the model is ready to be used to examine airway epithelial cell responses to respiratory pathogens, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Exposure to RSV results in a more rapid decline in polarized culture integrity compared to a mock-infection of cells (Figure 4) . ",

Cells that have grown beyond 90% confluence as a monolayer during subculturing, that have been subcultured more than 10 times from frozen stock, or that have not been supplied with fresh medium on a regular schedule are less likely to fully polarize, and any polarization is likely to decline rapidly. Incomplete or total lack of polarization may also be attributed to variation in the material and pore size of Transwells used for Calu-3 LCC, and lot-to-lot variation in Transwells of similar composition and pore size may also affect polarization. Larger pore sizes can allow Calu-3 to grow through the Transwell membrane into the basolateral compartment, preventing the culture from polarizing. An absence of polarization may also be due to bacterial growth, indicated by clouded culture medium, which leads to subsequent breakdown of the tight junctions between Calu-3 cells.",

While performing these operations, care should be taken to avoid introducing air bubbles into the apical and basolateral compartments, which will disrupt the ability of the voltohmmeter to detect resistance. The ability of the voltohmmeter to detect resistance in a culture that is actually polarized may also limited by protein buildup on the electrode leads.

This system permits better characterization of directional responses to pathogens compared to monolayer-cultured lung cell lines traditionally used to study respiratory pathogens, such as A549 and HEp-2 cells, with the additional advantages of Calu-3 LCC being more rapid to develop, more easily obtained, and less expensive to generate than primary, polarized, differentiated NHBE. Similar to NHBE, polarized Calu-3 demonstrate tight junction formation, and produce mucins. However, unlike NHBE, polarized Calu-3 cells do not differentiate into layers of basal cells and ciliated columnar epithelial cells, and few polarized Calu-3 cells develop cilia-like projections 19 . Thus, although useful for examining polarized responses of airway epithelial cells to respiratory insult, polarized Calu-3 LCC are not an ideal model to examine airway development or remodeling in response to respiratory insult or injury. Mucus production by cultured cells in vitro may impact cellular infectivity, as well as release of infectious virus and virus spread in a polarized model, and a direct comparison of the mucus production between polarized Calu-3 LCC and polarized, differentiated NHBE has not been reported. A549 and HEp-2 cells are easier to culture than Calu-3 cells, however, unlike Calu-3 LCC, they do not form polarized cultures when grown on Transwell inserts, and are thus not ideal models for examining in vitro the responses of polarized epithelial cells to respiratory virus infection.",

Gently remove D-PBS from wells. Add 600 \u03bcl sterile non-fluorescent buffer to the basolateral compartments. Add 100 \u03bcl sterile 1 mg/ml sodium fluorescein to the apical compartments. 5. Incubate the plate at 37 \u00b0C for 1 hr. CO 2 is not required during this incubation. 6. During incubation, prepare a sodium fluorescein standard curve ranging between 20 \u03bcg/ml and 0 \u03bcg/ml, using non-fluorescent buffer to dilute sodium fluorescein. Prepare at least 8 different concentrations of sodium fluorescein, each in a final volume of at least 600 \u03bcl. Keep standard curve dilutions protected from light until ready to measure absorbance. 7. Transfer the non-fluorescent buffer sample from the basolateral compartment of each test Transwell to a separate clean tube for analysis. Remove the test Transwells used to examine passive sodium fluorescein diffusion from the plate and discard. Return the plate with remaining Transwells to the incubator. 8. Place 100 \u03bcl of each standard solution in triplicate into a 96-well flat-bottomed plate. 9. Prepare three dilutions of each basolateral sample (1:2, 1:20, and 1:50) in non-fluorescent buffer, and add 100 \u03bcl of each undiluted sample and of each dilution, in duplicate, into a 96-well flat-bottom plate. 10. Measure sample absorbance on an ELISA plate reader at 486 nm or 490 nm. 11. Determine the concentration of sodium fluorescein in the basolateral compartment by comparing the absorbance of samples against the absorbance values for the sodium fluorescein standard curve.",
