Reliable serological assays are essential for epidemiological studies and vaccine evaluation. The objective of this study was to compare the ability of five enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to detect antibodies against different PEDV strains in pig serum. A total of 732 serum samples from North American or European pigs were tested. Samples included experimental samples from pigs infected with classical (G1a PEDV) or variant genogroup 1 PEDV (G1b PEDV), pandemic genogroup 2 PEDV (G2b PEDV) or non-infected controls. Field samples from herds with confirmed or unknown PEDV exposure were also used. Three indirect ELISAs based on G2b antigens (ELISAs 1, 2 and 3), a competitive ELISA based on the G2b antigen (ELISA 4) and a competitive ELISA based on the G1a antigen (ELISA 5) were compared. Overall, the tests had a moderate agreement ( = 0.61). G1a PEDV infected pigs were earliest detected by ELISA 3, G1b PEDV infected pigs were earliest detected by ELISAs 4 and 5 and the performance of all tests was similar for the G2b PEDV group. ELISA 1 showed the overall lowest detection on experimentally and field derived samples. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity with a 95% probability interval were estimated to be 68.2% (62.1-74.4%) and 97.5% (95.2-99.0%) for ELISA 1, 73.7% (71.5-79.6%) and 98.4% (96.6-99.5%) for ELISA 2, 86.2% (81.1-90.6%) and 91.6% (87.7-94.8%) for ELISA 3, 78.3% (72.8-83.5%) and 99.7% (98.2-100%) for ELISA 4, and 93.5% (90.3-96.0%) and 91.2% (83.8-97.9%) for ELISA 5. Differences in detection among assays seem to be more related to intrinsic factors of an assay than to the PEDV antigen used.",

The PEDV is highly contagious and causes enteric disease characterized by acute vom-CV777 and DR-13 (Song and Park, 2012) . Genogroup 1b strains, also known as S-INDEL strains, comprise new variant strains that contain genetic signatures of the classical G1a strains in their S gene and appear to have resulted from a recombination event between G1a and epidemic G2b viruses, also known as non-S-INDEL or pandemic strains (Lee, 2015) . Genogroup 1b strains have been reported in Asia, the North America and in Europe (Lee, 2015) . Since 2010, large-scale outbreaks with higher mortality in suckling piglets than previously described in Asia have been associated with PEDV G2a isolates, which are restricted to Asia, and G2b isolates (Song et al., 2015) . In 2013, a PEDV G2b isolate similar to PEDV strains circulating in China since 2011, was introduced into a swine dense area in the Midwest of the US. Following introduction, G2b PEDV spread rapidly across the US, further into Canada, and also into swine producing countries in Latin America (Song et al., 2015) .",

Available assays are either based on the whole virus (WV) (Hofmann and Wyler, 1990; Oh et al., 2005; Thomas et al., 2015) , the N protein (Hou et al., 2007; Okda et al., 2015) or the S protein (Gerber et al., 2014a; Knuchel et al., 1992) . The N protein, the most abundant viral protein expressed in PEDV infected cells, is highly conserved among PEDV genogroups (96-99.7% amino acid identity). The amino acid identity of the PEDV N protein is lower than 35% when compared to other porcine coronaviruses, however, it contains epitopes highly conserved among the family Coronaviridae, and cross reaction with certain TGEV strains have been reported (Lin et al., 2015) . An S-protein based ELISA has been shown to be more specific and sensitive than an N-protein based ELISA (Knuchel et al., 1992) , however, it has been suggested that the high heterogeneity of the S1 protein among PEDV isolates within and between genogroups (91-99.6% amino acid identity) could limit the sensitivity of S protein-based assays in the field (Lin et al., 2015) .",

The ELISA microplates were coated with the 1F12 capture monoclonal antibody (MAb) (Sozzi et al., 2010) . Serum samples, diluted 1:4, were mixed with equal volumes of whole cell culture adapted PEDV strain CV777 which was inactivated with \u00df-propiolactone to conserve antigenic properties and pre-incubated in an auxiliary microplate for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C. Then, 50 L of the pre-incubated mixtures were transferred into a 1F12 MAb coated plate and the conjugated horseradish peroxidase MAb 4C3 (Sozzi et al., 2010) was added. Following a further 1 h incubation at 37 \u2022 C the plate was washed. The optimal antigen concentration of the inactivated WV ELISA to obtain an optical density value of 1.0-1.5 in absence of a sample has been previously determined by testing two-fold serial dilutions of the cell supernatants. The colorimetric reaction was performed and optical densities (OD) were measured at 492 nm using an ELISA plate reader. Results were cal-culated by determining the absorbance value reduction, expressed as percentage of inhibition (PI) having the control wells as reference.

Indirect ELISAs have the advantage of requiring only one anti-species specific conjugate targeting a particular antibody subset such as anti IgA or IgG that are readily available, making it suitable for screening large number of samples (Schrijver and Kramps, 1998) . However, in indirect ELISAs, non-specific binding of antibodies is a common problem, because all antibodies that are bound in the well, either specifically or non-specifically, will be detected by the conjugated antibody, affecting its specificity (Schrijver and Kramps, 1998) . On the other hand, competitive ELISAs are generally recognized as being more specific than indirect ELISAs because interference due to antibody non-specific binding generally does not bias the test result and allow the use of partially purified virus when highly purified MAbs are used (Schrijver and Kramps, 1998) . Because of this characteristic, serum samples can be tested in low dilutions, which may contribute also to a higher sensitivity of this format (OIE, 2015) . However, unexpected interferences can also occur in competitive ELISAs. For example, purified WV contains all virally expressed proteins, which increases sensitivity but also increases the risk for cross-reaction with similar viruses (Simmons, 2008) . Truncation of the antigenic site in the N protein N-terminal region to exclude the immunodominant cross-reactive epitope or the usage of S protein as antigen for PEDV serology has been suggested to improve specificity of the immunoassays (Lin et al., 2015) .",

When the discrepant samples were further evaluated using an IFA, the indirect WV-ISU ELISA, the blocking DTU-bELISA contradictory results of these additional assays further complicated the serological diagnosis. As the 2015 non-exposed Italian farms were classified based on absence of clinical signs and PEDV RT-PCR negative results in fecal samples, the result suggests an unspecific reaction by one of the assays used. However, the high number of samples detected in a single farm (Farm 6) by ELISA 3 could indicate a cross-reaction with an unknown pathogen or a true positive result. Alignment of the S1 gene sequence and sequences publicly available through GenBank did not reveal similarities with any other pig pathogens (data not shown). Alternatively, the farm could have experienced a prior subclinical PEDV infection as the absence of PEDV RNA was based on a single point RT-PCR testing on ten fecal samples. Misclassifications of farms as \"negative\" could lead to artificially decreased specificity of assays. This bias in the specificity usually occurs because the positive serological results within these farms are classified as falsepositives. As the farms classified as negative were excluded from the sensitivity analysis, this did not affect the estimated sensitivity. Previous studies have shown that PEDV antibodies in serum samples can be detected up to 7 months after initial exposure (Goede et al., 2015; Ouyang et al., 2015) . Basing a negative farm classification on testing fecal samples by RT-PCR at a single time point could easily lead to a misclassification if the farm had experienced Table 4 Detection rates of anti-PEDV antibodies in field serum samples (n = 96) with discordant results, defined as a sample that exhibited a positive result in one or more ELISA and a negative result in another ELISA(s). Discordant samples were additionally tested by IFA, WV-ISU ELISA and the DTU-bELISA. Results were presented as number of positive tested samples for a given assay per farm. Light grey indicates that only one tested sample was positive with a given test and dark grey indicates that more than one sample was positive for a given test. nt = not tested. a clinically not recognized PEDV infection weeks or months before the testing. Phylogenetic studies showed that the PEDV strains currently associated with PEDV outbreaks in Italy are G1b strains (Boniotti et al., 2016) , which have been suggested to produce milder clinical signs when compared to G2b strains (Chen et al., 2016a) .",

            "text": "Although the evaluated assays presented an overall substantial agreement on the field samples from both tested countries, the agreement differed within subsets. The almost perfect agreement on the samples with known exposure may be explained by relative timing of PEDV infection (acute to subacute outbreaks) to sample collection and therefore the high number of positive samples, which could have artificially increased the estimates of sensitivity of the assays. In the sample set with unknown PEDV exposure, samples likely were obtained from animals in different phases of infection containing variable amounts of antibodies. Additionally, the unknown infection status for PEDV and other possible coronaviruses infections complicated the interpretation of discrepant results. ELISA 5, developed in Italy, had a much higher detection of positive serum samples in an Italian sample set with unknown PEDV exposure compared to a US subset of unknown samples. An increased positive detection by the competitive ELISA may be due to detection of IgA and IgM antibodies in addition to the IgG anti-bodies detected by the indirect ELISAs. However, the same trend was not observed with the competitive ELISA 4. Similarly, ELISA 3, developed in the US, had the highest detection among the US unknown samples subset. The sample set used for each assay optimization could partially explain the different detection proportions (Banoo et al., 2010) as the usage of same cut off for geographically different animal populations infected with different viral strains may result in different sensitivity and specificity. Similarly, the usage of only experimentally infected animals can lead to inflated estimates of accuracy when the samples have been collected only from animals at the peak of antibody production, or from animals from herds tested free for the most pathogens (Banoo et al., 2010) . Alternatively, a PEDV-TGEV recombinant virus was found to circulate in Italy during 2009 (Boniotti et al., 2016 . Although the PEDV-TGEV recombinant virus has not been detected after 2012 (Boniotti et al., 2016) , the presence of unidentified recombinant enteric coronaviruses could perhaps partially explain a higher positive detection for the WV-based ELISA 5.",

However, in the absence of 'gold standard' tests, latent-class models based on reference populations, and not individual reference samples can be used (OIE, 2015) . In the present study, a Bayesian approach was used to estimate the assays accuracy. Measures of diagnostic accuracy are extremely sensitive to the design of the study and although the usage of samples from different geographical populations herein could potentially increase representativeness, the accuracy of the presented results should be interpreted with caution. When applying a diagnostic assay, laboratories should observe if the cut-off values are applicable in their specific context and revise diagnostic sensitivity and specificity as required (Crowther et al., 2006) . It is critical that the diagnostic purpose of an assay is clearly defined in regard to the population to be tested (OIE, 2015) . As diagnostic sensitivity and diagnostic specificity are usually inversely related and as such a decrease in diagnostic specificity will result in elevated false positive results. Tests with moderate to high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity balance the false positive and false negative results and give a more accurate estimate of prevalence of infection or vaccination within a population (OIE, 2015) . The decision which assay should be used for PEDV antibodies monitoring at the herd level ultimately needs to be based on the expected prevalence of disease, desired specificity and sensitivity levels (screening or confirmatory test), easiness of testing, and access to a certain assay.",
