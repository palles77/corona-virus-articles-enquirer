            "text": "Capture-recapture methods are statistical methods that can be used to estimate the burden of disease, including influenza [9, [19] [20] [21] . This epidemiological approach combines data from 2 independent surveillance methods, and it can overcome the biases toward underestimation of disease burden that are inherent in each method when used separately. If passive and active surveillance are independently performed in overlapping time periods, then these results can be combined to estimate the total burden. An important strength is that capture-recapture analysis accounts for time periods when active surveillance was not performed during the study period.",

Like passive surveillance, this approach uses data collected for other purposes, making it less costly. However, this method is dependent on discharge diagnosis patterns in the population. For diseases that can have multiple clinical presentations and discharge diagnoses, such as influenza, administrative databases are sensitive but lack specificity. An approach that has been used to better measure disease burden is to estimate disease rates by combining discharge diagnosis data from administrative databases with data from active surveillance [9, 22] . This approach can estimate the number of cases during an epidemic that are not specifically diagnosed and can account for changes in disease prevalence over time.",

Specifically, the state laboratory identified a total of 487 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates during this season [26] . Further, capture-recapture analysis provided the opportunity to estimate the total burden of disease, since many patients were likely missed by both active and passive surveillance. Active surveillance was systematically performed only during weekdays, and thus it did not capture cases that presented on weekends or evenings. Passive surveillance was continuously available, but testing recommendations were focused on patients needing hospitalization or at risk for severe disease [28] ; thus many patients with suspected disease were not tested. As expected, the proportion of patients hospitalized with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was much lower in groups enrolled in active surveillance than in patient groups identified via passive surveillance (8% versus 93%, respectively). These data indicate that a large proportion of patients with influenza were seen in the ED but were not captured by passive surveillance, while many (but not all) hospitalized influenza patients were captured by this method. Hence, the estimated burden using capture-recapture methodology was approximately 8-fold higher than the disease burden estimated using passive surveillance alone.",

Given the large disease burden of undiagnosed influenza, accurate measurement of the disease burden is increasingly important, and this measurement is enhanced by the use of capture-recapture methods [9, [19] [20] [21] . We have used this statistical approach to overcome limitations inherent in active surveillance (limited sampling and high expense) and limitations in passive surveillance based on physicianordered testing (disease under-recognition and under-testing).

            "text": "This study has important limitations. First, case capture overlap between active and passive surveillance was just 4 persons, highlighting the fact that both surveillance systems had low sensitivity. However, this low overlap was expected both because active surveillance was not continuous and because passive surveillance followed the recommendations to test only those with severe disease or those at risk of complications [28] . Second, the use of influenzaassociated ICD-9 codes to estimate the burden of influenza relies on appropriate discharge coding. Significant variations in hospital ICD-9 coding practices were not observed, but bias due to this effect is a possibility. For example, if patients were assigned influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 codes other than the ICD-9 codes that we considered to be influenza-associated, this could lead to underestimation of influenza ED and hospital visit rates. However, we used hospital ICD-9 codes that have been previously reported. A third limitation is that the clinical performance of hospital laboratory testing for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 improved throughout the 2009-2010 season as testing methods were refined, and this may have led to relative under-ascertainment of influenza cases early in the season. Fourth, groups with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 that were identified using both active and passive surveillance had a larger proportion of blacks and Hispanics compared to the county population. This difference could represent a selection bias, leading to either an overestimation or underestimation of disease rates in these groups, or it could reflect differences in health care utilization. For example, there could be systematic differences between groups in terms of seeking influenza H1N1 vaccination, limiting potential exposures, or seeking care for acute respiratory illness symptoms. Finally, estimates of overall rates of ED and hospital visits for all persons in Forsyth County, North Carolina depended on hospital market share data, and the use of these data could introduce bias.",

Using both methods, we estimated 4-5 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 ED visits or hospitalizations per 1,000 residents. This capture-recapture approach led to an 8-fold higher estimate than the estimate generated using passive surveillance data alone, and our estimate highlighted the large burden of disease in the ED. Thus, capture-recapture analysis provides better estimates than passive surveillance when large numbers of visits occur in a short period of time, when diagnostic testing is performed infrequently or has low sensitivity, or when a significant proportion of disease is not clinically suspected. These results highlight the benefit of active surveillance, which provided important data that enabled both the capture-recapture analysis and the estimate derived from ICD-9 discharge codes from administrative data. It may be feasible to combine data from 2 independent surveillance systems between health care settings-such as hospitals, health departments, or community practice-in order to estimate the community-wide impact using capture-recapture analysis. Since 2010, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 has continued to circulate and remains an important cause of influenza disease. Efforts to develop more effective vaccines and treatments, as well as control strategies informed by accurate estimates of influenza burden, will be important as we work to control influenza as well as other epidemics.",
