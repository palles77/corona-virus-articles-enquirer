Nasopharyngeal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens of 229 children with acute respiratory tract infection were screened for KIPyV and WUPyV using polymerase chain reaction-based methods. KIPyV was detected in 2 (0.9%) and WUPyV in 1 (0.4%) patients, without co-infections with other respiratory viruses but with codetection of CMV, EBV and HHV 6 in one immunocompromised patient. Only a very small proportion (1.3%) of positive samples for KIPyV and WUPyV was documented in this study; the clinical relevance of these viruses remains unclear and requires further evaluation.",

Recently, two novel polyomaviruses were detected from respiratory secretions. Allander et al. [3] discovered a previously unrecognized human polyomavirus in 6 (1%) of 637 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) and 1 (0.5%) of 192 fecal samples and proposed a new KI polyomavirus (KIPyV). The second newly identified polyomavirus was described by Gaynor et al. in respiratory samples from Brisbane, Australia, and St. Louis, USA. The authors amplified and cloned the genome of WU Polyomavirus (WUPyV) from NPA of a 3-year-old patient with pneumonia without detection of other respiratory pathogens. Screening of 2,135 patients with RTI yielded 43 additional positive patients [8] .",

PCR amplifications were performed in 50-ll reaction mixtures under the following conditions: 25 pmol of each primer, 200 lM each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , and 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche, Germany).

Co-detection of KIPyV and WUPyV occurred in 14 patients, and only in one of these cases were no other respiratory virus present [6] . Norja et al. [12] detected KIPyV and WUPyV in 19 patients and viral co-infection in 10 patients, with predominant co-detection of adenovirus. The overall frequencies of detection of KIPyV and WUPyV were equal in patients with upper and lower respiratory tract infection, and in asymptomatic patients. Eight of the patients were immunocompromized [12] .",

The clinical relevance of other viruses (CMV, EBV, HHV 6) co-detected in one severely immunocompromised patient in a bronchoalveolar lavage specimen is unclear. Nevertheless, coinfections still remain possible, as we were not able to test for all putative copathogens, and the amounts of viral nucleic acids present in the samples may have fallen below the detection limits for some pathogens. Hence, we carefully suggest that KIPyV and WUPyV are more than a viral colonization, with the limitation of our study being that we did not examine children without acute respiratory symptoms.",
