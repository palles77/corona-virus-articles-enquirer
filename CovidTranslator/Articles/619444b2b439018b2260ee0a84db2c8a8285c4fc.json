            "text": "The Ontario Public Health Laboratories system (OPHL) is in the midst of a six-year plan to implement molecular tools for pandemic influenza diagnostics in one central and three regional public health laboratories. This plan has been formulated as a consequence of: 1) experiences gained through severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and comments of the members of the Expert Panel on SARS and Infectious Disease Control (i.e., the Walker report); 2) a review of pandemic preparedness literature; 3) historical and epidemiologic discussions about previous pandemics; and 4) suggestions made by various pandemic working committees. The OPHL plan includes: 1) an aggressive restructuring of the overall molecular microbiology testing capacity of the OPHL; 2) the ability to shift influenza testing of samples between designated OPHL laboratories; and 3) the development of screening tools for pandemic influenza diagnostic tests. The authors believe that investing in increased molecular testing capacity for regional laboratories outside the greater Toronto area will be beneficial to the OPHL system whether or not an influenza pandemic occurs. Well-trained technologists and microbiologists, and the introduction of new technologies, will facilitate the development of a wide variety of molecular tests for other infectious diseases at public health laboratories geographically distant from Toronto, thus enhancing overall laboratory testing capacity in the province of Ontario.",

Appropriate personnel will be trained to use these new tools in four designated OPHL testing facilities chosen based on multiple factors, including: geographic location, population size, and proximity to academic and clinical centres of excellence. Pandemic influenza screening tools will be created to triage specimen testing and to capture the maximum amount of clinical and epidemiologic data. The OPHL will increase pandemic surge capacity through the creation of redundancies in molecular testing capabilities across the province. The resulting system will function not only for the diagnosis of influenza, but also for other pathogens in settings such as sporadic cases, outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics. The OPHL is at the start of the second year of a six-year pandemic influenza plan, as described in Table I. The following sections provide the rationale for the OPHL plan.",

            "text": "Why an automated molecular platform was chosen for pandemic influenza diagnostics Molecular testing was chosen for pandemic influenza diagnostic testing for several reasons. Currently available rapid antigen detection kits have not been validated for avian or pandemic influenza and are not recommended by the World Health Organization for avian or pandemic influenza diagnostics (http://www.who.int/ csr/disease/avian_influenza/guidelines/ labtestsMarch07web.pdf). Culture of all suspect pandemic isolates requires Containment Level (CL)-3 facilities which is not feasible in Ontario (few available approved facilities), whereas molecular methods can be performed in CL-2 facilities (http://www.searo.who.int/en/ Section10/Section1027/Section1091_4305 .htm). Molecular tools also allow for the characterization of difficult to culture strains (ProMed-Mail Archive # 20050509.1277) and the detection of drug-resistant viruses as they emerge. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] As of March 2007, OPHL verified a new automated real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for diagnosis of influenza A and B. This methodology allows for testing of large numbers of samples with a relatively short turnaround time when compared to culturebased diagnostic methods, 14 (Table II) . These data, and the results of an informal retrospective survey of employee opinion with respect to the concomitant increase in workload during that critical period, indicate that OPHL must develop a testing model and diagnostic capacity to deal with anticipated five-to tenfold surges in testing in the event of a pandemic. Other factors increasing the workload during a pandemic may include multiple sample submissions per patient, 16 and emergence of a pandemic influenza strain in a series of waves or at the same time as seasonal influenza. [17] [18] [19] [20] Why pandemic influenza testing was decentralized to four regions A decentralized testing plan will be effective because a pandemic strain may not affect all regions within a single jurisdiction at the same time. 5, 21, 22 To allow for increased testing capacity and capacity shifting between regions, four molecular diagnostics testing facilities have been created in the OPHL system from distinct regions in Ontario (i.e., Northwestern, Southwestern, Central and Eastern). A key goal is to decrease the transportation time from physicians in the regions to molecular testing facilities across the province. The number of sites was limited to four to prevent over-extension of resources in training of staff and validation of assays, and to limit the amount of work required to ensure competency for the Ontario Laboratory Accreditation (OLA) process. Other criteria for choosing the location of testing sites included accessibility to laboratory staff, proximity to ground and air transportation routes, ability of each individual laboratory to absorb molecular testing, and proximity to a centre of excellence (i.e., a University, College or other institution) for collaboration purposes and continued education of staff.",

Discussions with OPHL employees working during SARS uncovered the perception that inappropriate preanalytical processes resulted in significant laboratory resources being wasted and may have hampered downstream analytical and postanalytical processes. To prevent this problem from occurring again, the OPHL has compiled guidelines for clients entitled \"Pandemic/avian influenza in suspected cases-specimen collection and transportation guidelines\", available as a \"Labstract\" from the following url: (http://www.health.gov.on.ca/ english/providers/pub/labs/labstracts/ panflu_avian_LAB-SD-015-000.pdf). 23 This communication informs clinicians, public health personnel and other stakeholders of the pre-analytical steps required for a sample to be tested for avian or pandemic influenza (by molecular diagnostics) during the current pandemic alert period.

The various resources invested now under the umbrella of pandemic planning can be justifiable in highly trained staff and an infrastructure is available for the benefit of patients regardless of whether or not an influenza pandemic arises in the future. 24 Decentralization of molecular testing allows for flexibility within a well-connected laboratory network, and ensures that molecular diagnostic testing continues, even during times of natural or human disasters. 25, 26 ",

Le plan en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9 d'apr\u00e8s : 1) les le\u00e7ons de la crise du syndrome respiratoire aigu s\u00e9v\u00e8re (SRAS) et les commentaires des membres du Comit\u00e9 d'experts sur le SRAS et la lutte contre les maladies infectieuses (rapport Walker); 2) l'examen de la documentation sur la pr\u00e9paration \u00e0 une pand\u00e9mie; 3) les analyses historiques et \u00e9pid\u00e9miologiques des pand\u00e9mies ant\u00e9rieures; et 4) les suggestions de divers comit\u00e9s de travail sur les pand\u00e9mies. Le plan des LSPO englobe : 1) une restructuration approfondie de l'ensemble des outils de d\u00e9pistage bas\u00e9s sur la microbiologie mol\u00e9culaire dans les laboratoires; 2) la possibilit\u00e9 de transf\u00e9rer d'un LSPO d\u00e9sign\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre l'analyse des \u00e9chantillons grippaux; et 3) l'\u00e9laboration d'outils de s\u00e9rodiagnostic de la grippe pand\u00e9mique. Selon les auteurs, le fait d'investir davantage dans la capacit\u00e9 de d\u00e9pistage mol\u00e9culaire des laboratoires r\u00e9gionaux \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du Grand Toronto serait b\u00e9n\u00e9fique pour le syst\u00e8me des LSPO, peu importe si une pand\u00e9mie de grippe survient ou non. Des technologues et des microbiologistes bien form\u00e9s, ainsi que l'implantation de nouvelles technologies, faciliteront l'\u00e9laboration d'un vaste \u00e9ventail de tests mol\u00e9culaires pour d'autres maladies infectieuses dans les laboratoires de d\u00e9pistage sanitaire \u00e9loign\u00e9s de Toronto, ce qui devrait am\u00e9liorer globalement la capacit\u00e9 de d\u00e9pistage en laboratoire en Ontario.Mots cl\u00e9s : planification entourant une pand\u00e9mie; grippe; tests mol\u00e9culaires; RT-PCR; diagnostic Since 1910, the Canadian Public Health Association has been Canada's Public Health Leader.
