IL2 also regulates the evolution of memory T cells after resolution of infection. 7 An excessive cytokine-mediated inflammatory response can be harmful to the host, resulting in severe forms of malaria and sepsis. [8] [9] [10] [11] Control of cytokine signalling in humans is mediated in part via negative feedback by the Suppressor of Cytokine Signalling (SOCS) family of proteins. CISH (cytokine inducible SH-2 domain protein) was the first member of the SOCS family to be described. 12 , 13 CISH has recently been shown to be the gene most consistently up-regulated by IL2 stimulation in humans 14 and appears to be critical for T-cell proliferation and survival 15 in response to infection. CISH controls the signalling of a variety of cytokines, in particular IL2. Unlike the other members of the SOCS family, CISH binds to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues of cytokine receptors through its SH-2 domain and masks sites at which STAT5 would otherwise dock. 12, [16] [17] [18] [19] Thus, increased CISH activity blocks the cytoplasmic docking and activation of STAT5, and thereby inhibits downstream cytokine signalling.",

In the Hong Kong TB study (HKTB), those with TB were more likely to carry a couple of variant CISH alleles (at positions \u2212292 and +1320) than unaffected persons (P=0.031 and P=2.0\u00d710 \u22123 respectively). In the case-control TB study from the Gambia (GTB), we observed association between the CISH +1320 variant allele (but not the \u2212292 SNP variant allele) and susceptibility to clinical tuberculosis (P=0.033). The positive trend test for TB observed in the MTB study was replicated in both HKTB (P=0.011) and GTB (P=0.034).",

One possible explanation for this heterogeneity is that disease susceptibility was accounted for by more than one SNP within the five-SNP panel, thus rendering single SNP analysis incomplete. A second reason might relate to underlying population structure, where different CISH SNPs may tag the informative variants in each distinct population. A third possibility is that there remain unidentified functional SNPs within the region of association delineated by the five-SNP panel that also account for association with disease. This last possibility is unlikely however, as direct sequencing did not detect additional putatively functional polymorphisms. To explore the first and second possibilities, we utilized multi-SNP scoring for all five associated SNPs. Risk of disease increased markedly with an increase in the number of risk alleles carried in each population. As this multi-SNP analysis was more informative than single-point analysis, the above two possibilities remain plausible explanations. The mechanisms underlying an association between the CISH multi-SNP score and accompanying dose-dependant effect on disease susceptibility likely reflect the potential regulatory effect of these polymorphisms within a 'multi-hit model', whereby each 'hit' affects gene expression cumulatively in aggregate. Such a process is in contrast to structural variants, where the presence of one deleterious mutation may be sufficient to account for disease.",

Although \u2212292 showed associations with multiple infectious diseases and could be a true functional variant, CISH +1320 showed a stronger association with susceptibility to TB, and showed association in each of the \"TB\" studies. The possibility that variation at +1320 affect transcript expression is possible; this position is located in the untranslated portion of exon 2. 29 Further work is required to document the precise mechanisms whereby reduced CISH expression (and presumably consequential disturbed IL2 signaling) predisposes to increased risk of infectious disease. Stimulation by IL2 may enhance microbial and viral replication, 30 and its effect may be further dependent on the presence of other immune cells: clinical trials of IL2 infusion in HIV-positive patients have shown different effects on individuals depending on their CD4+ counts. 31, 32 Although it is perhaps unexpected that common variation within a single gene influences susceptibility to a diverse range of infectious diseases, there is increasing evidence that disparate infections are recognized by a common host inflammatory pathway. 8, [33] [34] [35] The observation that the risk alleles occur at appreciable allele frequencies in each of the study populations is surprising, given evidence suggestive of evolutionary selective pressure ",

The observed risk allele frequency of CISH \u2212292 and \u2212163 was 41.5% and 6.1% respectively, with only a single volunteer found to be homozygous for the variant allele at position \u2212163; CISH \u2212639 was nonpolymorphic in these individuals, consistent with observations from the Hong Kong Chinese case-control studies. We first examined the individual effects of SNPs \u2212292 and \u2212163 on CISH gene expression in human PBMCs following stimulation with IL2 at a final concentration of 100U/mL. As expression levels of the wild-type CISH \u2212292A/A and carrier CISH \u2212292A/T genotypes were similar (P>0.9), we questioned whether this SNP might exert a recessive effect. As shown inFigure 3a, individuals homozygous for the variant CISH \u2212292T/T risk genotype (n=10) showed significantly lower levels of CISH when compared with either those homozygous for alternative allele (A/A)(n=5) or heterozygous carriers (A/T)(n=10) at 0.5, 1 and 2 hours post-stimulation with IL2. We did not observe any difference in CISH expression (with respect to CISH \u2212292 genotype) following stimulation with IL3. Nor did we observe a genotype-specific difference (according to allelic variation at position \u2212163) after stimulating cells with either IL2 or IL3 (P>0.8, data not shown).",
