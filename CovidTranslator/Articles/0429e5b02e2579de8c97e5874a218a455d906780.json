An important data source for syndromic surveillance is free-text chief complaints (CCs), which may be recorded in different languages. For automated syndromic surveillance, CCs must be classified into predefined syndromic categories to facilitate subsequent data aggregation and analysis. Despite the fact that syndromic surveillance is largely an international effort, existing CC classification systems do not provide adequate support for processing CCs recorded in non-English languages. This paper reports a multilingual CC classification effort, focusing on CCs recorded in Chinese.",

At the same time, it also shortens the time needed for a disease to spread. A case in point is the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) episode which started in the Guangdong Province, China in November, 2002 and spread to Toronto, Vancouver, Ulaan Bator, Manila, Singapore, Hanoi, and Taiwan by March, 2003 . The disease was finally brought under control and the whole episode ended in July, 2003. There were a total of 8096 known cases, and about 35% were outside mainland China (cf. http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/). The SARS experience indicates that an effective plan for infectious disease detection and prevention, in which syndromic surveillance may play an important role, should be considered on a global scale [1, 2] . However, only a few countries have adopted formal syndromic surveillance systems. The U.S. public health system has significant experience in developing and adopting syndromic surveillance systems. However, leveraging such experience in international contexts is proven to be difficult. Multilingual data present a major barrier, as different languages are used by medical and public health practitioners in different parts of the world. This is particularly true for a major data source used by many syndromic surveillance systems: emergency department (ED) triage freetext chief complaints (CCs).",

The supervised learning methods require CC records to be labeled with syndromes before being used for model training. Naive Bayesian [8] [9] [10] and Bayesian network [4] models are two examples of the supervised learning methods studied. One prerequisite of supervised learning methods is collecting a sufficient amount of training records, which is usually costly and time-consuming. Another major disadvantage of supervised learning methods is the lack of flexibility. New syndromic definitions may be required by public health practitioners as new events may indicate new surveillance focuses. However, it is often difficult to produce new training data for new syndromic definitions.",

In most syndromic categories, the MIM method generates PPV, sensitivity, specificity, F measure and F2 measure higher than 0.9. Rash syndrome has the worst performance with F measure of 0.82. The fever syndrome has the best performance with F measure of 0.97. Compared to Google Translation, the MIM method has significantly higher PPV, sensitivity, and specificity in most syndromic categories. Given the significant differences in PPV and sensitivity, it is not surprising to find that the MIM method has significantly higher F measure and F2 measure than those of the Google Translation, as these two measures are the functions of PPV and sensitivity. It is interesting to note that MIM has significantly higher F measure and F2 measure in all syn- dromic categories except the fever syndrome. MIM and Google Translation have almost the same performance for the fever syndrome. A review of translation results in this syndromic category shows that one keyword (\"fever\") can cover more than 90% of all true positive cases. As a result, providing good translation for this category is relatively easier than that of other categories. Overall the experimental results indicate that the MIM method provides better syndrome classification performance comparing to processing Chinese CCs using the Google machine translation system. Table 5 summarizes performance comparison between MIM and Bilingual Dictionary. In general, MIM performs much better than Bilingual Dictionary in terms of PPV, sensitivity specificity, F and F2 measures. Most of the performance difference is significant at a 99% confidence level. Note that Bilingual Dictionary has zero sensitivity in fever syndrome. The reason behind the low performance is because fever was translated to \"have a high temperature\" by the definition of the bilingual dictionary. The BioPortal CC classifier failed to recognize the phrase as related to fever syndrome. A review of individual translated CC records indicated that there was a gap between the terms covered by the bilingual dictionary and the terms that were commonly seen in our Chinese CC dataset.",

Google translated the CC as \"general soreness sore throat this morning before,\" which was accurate. The translation result from Bilingual Dictionary, nevertheless, failed to provide any meaningful information for syndromic surveillance. As mentioned above, the major reason behind the poor translation results of Bilingual Dictionary was the lack of medically related terminologies in the dictionary collection. Another example can be found in Table 7 . The raw Chinese CC \" (verbatim translation: vomiting. began this evening)\" contains symptoms related to gastrointestinal syndrome. The MIM method did a better job by giving the translation \"vomiting.\" Google translated it as \"spit at the beginning,\" which is incorrect. Surprisingly, the translation of Bilingual Dictionary was very similar to that of Google. The poor performance of Google may be due to the concise nature of CCs. There is no context for the machine translation system to disambiguate \" \" as vomiting instead of spit.",

But \"have a high temperature\" could not be linked to fever syndrome in subsequent processing. The Bilingual Dictionary indeed had \"have a fever\" as its second translation. However, there was no simple way to decide when other translations instead of the first one should be used ex ante. Google Language Tool provided the correct translation for fever but gave \"surge\" as the translation for \" (gasping).\" The translation for \" (gasping)\" was wrong and we could not find any relation between the translated term \"surge\" and the original Chinese expression. A possible explanation is that the training dataset for Google translation system did not include documents in medical context and thus it has problem providing high quality medical translation.",

We used a statistical pattern extraction method based on the mutual information to extract important phrases from Chinese CCs and constructed mappings to English. The UMLSbased BioPortal CC classifier, which was designed to process CCs in English, was used to process translated CCs. We compared the syndrome classification performance of the proposed translation method with those using the machine translation system provided by the Google Language Tool and a bilingual dictionary. Compared to Google Translation, our approach delivered significantly higher PPV, sensitivity, specificity, F measure, and F2 measure for most syndromic categories. We found similar results in the comparison between our approach and the translations provided by the bilingual dictionary. ",
