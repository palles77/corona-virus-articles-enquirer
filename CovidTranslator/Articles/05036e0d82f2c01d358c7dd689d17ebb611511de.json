Recent work has suggested that certain RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm disrupt the normal trafficking of cellular RNAs and proteins within the host cell. This review will examine the recent evidence showing that poliovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) can inhibit nucleo-cytoplasmic transport within cells. Interestingly, the data indicate that inhibition by both viruses involves targeting components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Following this, several possible explanations for why viruses might disrupt nucleo-cytoplasmic transport are discussed. Finally, the possibility that disruption of nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking may be a more common feature of RNA virus \u00c1/host interactions than previously thought is examined. #",

The vertebrate NPC is composed of at least 30 different proteins and has a molecular weight of over 125 MDa (Cronshaw et al., 2002; Stoffler et al., 1999) . Many of the proteins that make up the NPC contain a repeating FG amino acid motif and are thus defined as a family of proteins called nucleoporins (Nups) (Ryan and Wente, 2000) . The directionality of nucleo-cytoplasmic transport is thought to be provided by the small GTPase Ran, which is predicted to be in a GDP bound state in the cytoplasm, and in a GTP bound form in the nucleus (reviewed in Bischoff et al., 2002) . Ran-GTP destabilizes import receptor:cargo complexes in the nucleus resulting in the release of cargo into the nucleoplasm. Conversely, binding of export receptors to cargos is stabilized by Ran-GTP and release of cargo occurs following hydrolysis of Ran-GTP in the cytoplasm.",

For example, at late times during infection adenovirus mRNAs are efficiently exported to the cytoplasm while the export of cellular mRNAs is inhibited (Beltz and Flint, 1979) . The export of viral mRNA appears to be due to the shuttling ability of the E4 34 kDa protein in combination with the RNA binding activity of the E1B-55 kDa protein (Dobbelstein et al., 1997) . While these same two proteins are responsible for the inhibition of cellular mRNA export, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this are not known (Babiss and Ginsberg, 1984; Babiss et al., 1985; Halbert et al., 1985; Pilder et al., 1986; Weinberg and Ketner, 1986) . The influenza virus NS1 protein also selectively inhibits export of host mRNAs to the cytoplasm (Alonso-Caplen et al., 1992; Fortes et al., 1994) . Inhibition of transport by NS1 appears to be due to its ability to impair 3? end formation of cellular mRNAs through interaction with CPSF and PAB II (Chen et al., 1999; Nemeroff et al., 1998) . Two other examples of viral inhibition of nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking have been reported (Gustin and Sarnow, 2001; Her et al., 1997) . Interestingly, both of these cases involve RNA viruses that replicate entirely within the cytoplasm and involve interactions with the NPC.",

Fusion of the classical NLS with GFP results in a protein that is predominantly nuclear in uninfected cells ( Fig. 2A ).

Transportin is the import receptor utilized by a number of different hnRNPs and was identified through its interaction with the M9 NLS of hnRNP A1 (Pollard et al., 1996) . The M9 NLS is a glycine-rich sequence that confers both nuclear import and export activity (Michael et al., 1995) . Cargos containing the M9 NLS are imported to the nucleus via interaction with transportin, while the receptor responsible for export has not been identified (Izaurralde and Adam, 1998; . Fusion of the M9 NLS to GFP (GFP-M9) results in a protein that is predominantly nuclear in uninfected cells. When the distribution of GFP-M9 was examined in poliovirus-infected cells, however, a significant amount was observed to accumulate in the cytoplasm (Gustin and Sarnow, 2001) . Relocalization required a functional NLS, as a GFP-M9 molecule containing a single amino acid substitution that disrupts interaction with transportin failed to redistribute in infected cells (Gustin and Sarnow, 2001) . In addition, endogenous cargos of the transportin pathway, such as hnRNP A1 relocalized to the cytoplasm of infected cells (Gustin and Sarnow, 2001) . Cumulatively, these results indicated that a second import pathway, that of transportin, was inhibited in poliovirus-infected cells.",

Like hnRNP A1, hnRNP K is a nuclear protein that shuttles between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartment. Shuttling of hnRNP K is mediated by an amino acid motif termed the K nuclear shuttling (KNS) signal (Michael et al., 1997) . The import and export receptors that recognize the KNS signal have not been identified but competition experiments indicate that they are distinct from those used by the classical or transportin import pathways (Michael et al., 1997) . The trafficking of hnRNP K was examined in infected cells by indirect immunofluorescence. The results of this analysis demonstrated that hnRNP K relocalized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of cells following infection with poliovirus, and suggested that, in addition to the classical and transportin pathways, the KNS import pathway was disrupted during poliovirus infection (Gustin and Sarnow, 2001) .",

            "text": "The findings described above suggest that the classical, transportin and KNS import pathways are disrupted during poliovirus infection and provide a possible explanation for the cytoplasmic accumulation of nuclear factors. For example, nucleolin has a classical NLS (Schmidt-Zachmann and Nigg, 1993) and the import of La has been recently shown to require components of the classical pathway (Rosenblum et al., 1998) . Thus, disruption of the classical import pathway would be predicted to result in the accumulation of nucleolin and La in the cytoplasm. The import of (1996) and Gustin and Sarnow (2002) a Reported functions of indicated protein in uninfected cells. b Reference demonstrating cytoplasmic accumulation of nuclear protein in infected cells. c PTB has not been shown to accumulate in the cytoplasm of rhinovirus-infected cells. Sam68 (Ishidate et al., 1997) and PTB (Romanelli et al., 1997) , on the other hand, appears to involve novel import pathways. This raises the interesting possibility that other import pathways, in addition to the ones mentioned above, may be disrupted during poliovirus infection. Despite this possibility, poliovirus infection does not inhibit all trafficking pathways between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This was demonstrated by monitoring the transport of a fusion protein consisting of the glucocorticoid hormone binding domain (GC), the HIV-1 Rev protein and GFP (REV \u00c1/GC \u00c1/GFP) (Love et al., 1998) . The GC confers hormone dependent nuclear import upon heterologous proteins (Picard and Yamamoto, 1987) . Consequently, in the absence of hormone ligand the REV \u00c1/GC \u00c1/GFP fusion protein is restricted to the cytoplasm, but following the addition of hormone it is rapidly (within 30 min) imported into the nucleus ( Fig. 3A and Love et al., 1998) . Although the receptor responsible for nuclear import of the GC has not been identified, import does not require importin a, suggesting that a non-classical pathway is used (Savory et al., 1999) . The HIV-1 REV protein mediates nuclear export of REV \u00c1/GC \u00c1/GFP due to the presence of a leucine-rich NES that interacts with the cellular export receptor, Crm1 (Fischer et al., 1995) . The hormone induced import of REV \u00c1/GC \u00c1/GFP is reversible and following the removal of hormone, REV \u00c1/GC \u00c1/GFP is rapidly exported to the cytoplasm due to the Rev NES ( Fig. 3B and Love et al., 1998) .",

For this analysis, REV \u00c1/GC \u00c1/ GFP was allowed to accumulate in infected cell nuclei, then hormone was removed, and the appearance of REV \u00c1/GC \u00c1/GFP in the cytoplasm monitored. Again, the appearance of REV \u00c1/GC \u00c1/GFP in the cytoplasm was indistinguishable from that of uninfected cells (Fig. 3B) . Accumulation of REV \u00c1/GC\u00c1/GFP could be blocked by the addition of leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of Crm1 dependent export ( Fig. 3C and Wolff et al., 1997) , demonstrating that the export of REV \u00c1/GC \u00c1/GFP was mediated by Crm1 in poliovirus-infected cells.

Four hours after infection cells were untreated ((/hormone) or treated with dexamethasone ('/hormone) at 1 mM for 30 min prior to fixation.

This assay utilizes digitoninpermeabilized cells that have been washed extensively to remove the soluble components required for nuclear import such as import receptors and Ran (Adam et al., 1990) . The import assay is initiated by the addition of a source of soluble components such as rabbit reticulocyte lysate, GTP and an import cargo that can be easily detected in the cell nucleus (Adam et al., 1992) . When poliovirus-infected cells were permeabilized with digitonin and incubated with an import cargo containing a classical NLS, RRL and GTP, very little of the import cargo accumulated in the infected cell nucleus, demonstrating that poliovirus-infected cells do not support the classical nuclear import pathway (Gustin and Sarnow, 2001) .",

Under these conditions translocation through the NPC is blocked, but energy independent interactions between the NPC and receptor:cargo complexes occurs, resulting in the accumulation of import cargo at the nuclear rim (Adam et al., 1990) . This is thought to represent 'docking' of receptor:cargo complexes at the NPC and is one of the earliest steps in the translocation process. When digitonin-permeabilized poliovirus-infected cells were assayed in the absence of energy, very little of the import cargo accumulated at the nuclear rim, indicating that docking of receptor:cargo complexes at the NPC was inhibited (Gustin and Sarnow, 2001) . These results demonstrated convincingly that poliovirus infection results in an inhibition of the classical nuclear import pathway that may be caused, at least in part, by an inability of receptor:cargo complexes to successfully dock at the NPC.",

Thus, the loss of either of these components could result in an inhibition of nuclear import via the classical pathway (Fig. 4B) . The loss of Nup153 and p62 could also have effects that extend to other transport pathways such as those used by the cellular proteins shown to relocalize in poliovirus-infected cells (Table 1) . For example, Nup153 has been shown to bind directly to Ran-GDP , while p62 is known to interact with NTF2, a protein required for the nuclear import of Ran Ribbeck et al., 1998; Smith et al., 1998) .

In addition, Nup153 can interact in-vitro with transportin , and disruption of this interaction could impair the nuclear import of transportin cargos, such as hnRNP A1. Recently, however, Walther et al. (2001) reported the de novo assembly of NPCs using Xenopus oocyte extracts from which Nup153 had been depleted. These Nup153-deficient NPCs supported the import of a cargo bearing an M9 NLS, but not that of a cargo containing a classical NLS (Walther et al., 2001) . Interestingly, depletion of Nup153 from Xenopus extracts resulted in the formation NPCs lacking many components of the nuclear basket (Walther et al., 2001) . Thus, the inhibition of the transportin import pathway in poliovirus-infected cells may be attributable to loss of p62 or other, as yet unidentified NPC components.",

Interestingly however, the M protein also encodes functions that are distinct from its role in viral assembly. For example, expression of the M protein has been shown to cause the cell rounding (Blondel et al., 1990) and inhibition of transcription (Black and Lyles, 1992) typical of VSV infections. Genetically these different roles of the M protein in VSV infection can be separated.

In cells lacking Nup98, however, much less VSV M was associated with the nuclear rim, suggesting that interaction with Nup98 directed M to the NPC (von Kobbe et al., 2000) . It should be pointed out, however, that a small amount of VSV M was detected at the nuclear envelope in Nup98 knockout cells, and this may be due to an inherent ability of M to associate with membranes (von Kobbe et al., 2000; Ye et al., 1994) . Alternatively, inhibition of transport by M may involve interaction with as yet unidentified NPC components. Because of this, it would be interesting to determine if M can still inhibit transport across the NPC in cells lacking Nup98.",

In addition, Nup98 is also found associated with intra-nuclear filaments that extend from the NPC into the nucleus (Fontoura et al., 2001) . Inactivation of Nup98 by injection of antibodies into Xenopus oocytes resulted in defects in snRNA, rRNA and mRNA export but did not inhibit tRNA export or protein import (Powers et al., 1997) . Interestingly, these defects in RNA transport are very similar to those seen in Xenopus oocytes expressing the VSV M protein. Photobleaching studies revealed that Nup98 is mobile and moves between the nuclear filaments and the NPC in a transcription dependent manner, consistent with its role in RNA export (Griffis et al., 2002) . The observations that Nup98 interacts with transportin, the import receptor for hnRNP A1, suggests that it may have roles in nuclear import as well (Fontoura et al., 2000) . Thus, disruption of Nup98 function by VSV M could account for the defects in export and import pathways observed in Xenopus oocytes expressing M (Fig. 3) . As mentioned above, however, antibodies to Nup98 did not inhibit protein import in Xenopus oocytes, indicating that VSV M may target additional components of the NPC to bring about inhibition of this transport pathway.",

In the case of poliovirus and rhinovirus infections, nuclear proteins known to accumulate in the cytoplasm have roles in a diverse array of activities pertaining to RNA metabolism including; transcription, processing, transport, translation and stability (Table 1) .

For example, the interferon response pathway requires that signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) be imported into the nucleus to activate expression of genes encoding anti-viral functions (reviewed in Stark et al., 1998) . Inhibition of nucleo-cytoplasmic transport could prevent the import of activated STATs or the export of target gene mRNAs, thus reducing the effectiveness of the interferon response. Interestingly, a recent study has revealed a link between the interferon response and the NPC. Enninga et al. (2002) found that expression of two NPC proteins, Nup98 and Nup96, was induced by interferong treatment. Remarkably, induction of Nup98/96 expression by interferon-g relieved the block to mRNA export caused by the VSV M protein (Enninga et al., 2002) . While the exact function of Nup98 in the antiviral response is not known, these findings suggest that rhabdoviruses, such as VSV, may target Nup98 in an effort to inhibit its antiviral activity. The finding that certain picornaviruses also target components of the NPC suggest that this could be a common mechanism by which RNA viruses inhibit the host response to infection. In support of this possibility, analysis of whole cell lysates has revealed that Nup98 is rapidly degraded following infection with poliovirus (Gustin and Sarnow, unpublished) .",

More recently, the analysis of rhinovirus type 14-infected cells has shown that other picornaviruses inhibit nuclear import and target Nup153 and p62 for degradation (Gustin and Sarnow, 2002) .

The cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP A1 in cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus suggests that the transportin import pathway may be disrupted in coronavirus-infected cells (Li et al., 1997) . The hepatitis C virus NS5A protein has been reported to interact with karyopherin b3, a member of the importin b family of proteins that has been implicated in ribosomal protein import (Chung et al., 2000; Jakel and Gorlich, 1998) . Expression of karyopherin b3 can functionally complement the loss of two yeast importin b family members, PSE1/KAP121 and KAP123 (Chung et al., 2000) .",

It is intriguing that two unrelated RNA viruses disrupt nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking and appear to do so by targeting components of the NPC. For VSV this requires association of M with the NPC mediated at least in part through interaction with Nup98. In the case of poliovirus, inhibition of transport correlates with the degradation of two NPC components, Nup153 and p62. As mentioned above however, both viruses may target as yet unidentified NPC proteins to bring about inhibition of transport. Identifying additional targets at the NPC will help to determine if common mechanisms may be responsible for the inhibition of nuclear transport mediated by these viruses. Exactly how widespread inhibition of nucleo-cytopasmic trafficking is and its role in viral replication remains to be determined.",
