How to properly formulate social evolution theory has also been contentious. Here we evaluate kin and multilevel selection theory as tools for analyzing microbial data. We reanalyze published datasets that share a common exper-5 imental design and evaluate these theories in terms of data visualization, statistical performance, biological interpretation, and quantitative comparison across systems. We find that the canonical formulations of both kin and multilevel selection are almost always poor analytical tools because they use statistical regressions that are poorly specified for the strong selection and nonadditive fitness effects common in microbial systems. Analyzing both individual and group fitness outcomes 10 helps clarify the biology of selection. We also identify analytical practices in empirical research that suggest how theory might better handle the challenges of microbial data. A quantitative, data-driven approach thus shows how kin and multilevel selection theory both have substantial room for improvement as tools for understanding social evolution in all branches of life.",

Kin selection theory, for example, has been enormously influential in part because it shows that social evolution can be understood from just a few important quantities: how a behavior affects the fitness of an actor, how that behavior affects the fitness of other individuals, and the genetic relatedness between social partners [1, 2] . This theory 20 was developed with a major focus on animal behavior, so its mathematical form was developed in terms of the quantitative-genetic phenotypes most easily measured in animal systems [3] . Similarly, evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) models of kin selection were formulated to facilitate predictions and empirical tests using comparative data [4] with substantial success [5, 6, 7] .",

Aside 25 from these organisms' intrinsic biological interest and importance as pathogens and mutualists, they allow for empirical methods that would be impractical or impossible in non-microbial systems. Fitness, for example, is notoriously difficult to measure in multicellular organisms [9] . In microbial systems, however, it is common practice to directly measure the fitness effect of a defined change in genotype or environment under controlled laboratory conditions. Evolution can be even be contentious [21, 22] , but it has so far been difficult to evaluate the usefulness of different approaches as analytical tools because they have been debated mostly as abstract mathematics or as verbal interpretations of specific models and results.",

We analyze datasets from published mix experiments using the canonical formulations of kin and multilevel selection theory and use quantitative measures of statistical performance to assess what these approaches do well, where they run into problems, and how often these problems occur. For guidance on how theory might better handle the challenges of microbial data, we also identify analytical practices in empirical research that are robust across different microbial systems, provide insight into the causes of selection, and allow quantitative comparison of social selection across systems. A quantitative, data-driven approach can thus be a productive way forward to identify how theory can best aid our understanding of social evolution in all branches 70 of life.",

We included experiments published in the last twenty 75 years that measured the asexual survival and reproduction of strains as a function of their initial frequency, holding constant the total number of individuals. We aimed for breadth of species and social trait, prioritizing studies with several mixing frequencies (as opposed to a single 50:50 mix). We identified 39 studies that included experiments matching our criteria. We sought raw data from journal websites, public data archives, or directly from study authors. We reformatted datasets to 80 express each experiment's initial and final states as the number or density of individuals belonging to each strain, the proportion of individuals belonging to a strain, and/or the total number of individuals-whatever most closely matched the measured quantities. So that our results would not be overly dominated by a few studies with many mix experiments, we included a maximum 12 datasets per study, prioritizing those with most replication and covering the observed range of 85 interactions. In all, we obtained 80 datasets from 20 different studies for further analysis (Table  S1 ).",

A common rule of thumb is models perform substantially differently if |\u2206AIC| > 2, equivalent to adding a parameter without 120 improving goodness of fit. We sometimes compared the best-performing models (least AIC) from sets of candidates (Table S3 ). To compare models fit to linear or log-transformed fitness outcomes, we calculated the AIC of logarithmic models, as measured on the linear scale, as AIC() plus the Jacobian of the log transform: 2 ln y j , where the y j are the fitted values [27]. We calculated unstandardized fitness effect sizes as e \u03b2 , where \u03b2 are the regression coefficients 125 in \"log-linear\" models of the form m \u223c g + G + gG, M \u223c G, and \u2206m \u223c G.

Overall, strain and multilevel fitness outcomes mostly told similar stories, with the notable exception that mixing frequently affected strain fitness much more than total group fitness. We found similar results when comparing effect sizes scaled as a fraction of the total so that the relationships would be less dominated by extreme values (Fig. S3 , 240 S7B). Strain and total group fitness are only expected to respond similarly to mixing when withingroup selection and the fitness effects of individual genotype are small relative to the effects of group and neighbor genotype (Eqns. S17, S19). In many datasets, however, there was strong selection within groups but little change in total group fitness, a situation known as soft selection [31, 32, 33] . Soft selection can happen when total population size is determined by some limited resource over 245 which strains compete-glucose in a flask of media, for example. Some fitness outcomes might be more convenient to analyze because they are more linear over logarithmic scales. If strain fitness is a log-linear function of mixing proportion, for example, then total group fitness is log-nonlinear, and vice versa (Eqns. S17, S19). To address this issue, we examined how well log-linear models fit to one set of fitness outcomes predicted the other set. We 250 found that the best-performing model was sometimes neighbor-modulated fitness and sometimes multilevel fitness, depending on the dataset (Fig. S4) .",

Studies that directly measured a fitness outcome were not more likely to report it (Fisher exact test: strain P = 1, total group P = 0.54, within-group P = 0.088). Instead, studies reported relative within-group performance most frequently and strain 285 performance the least (Fisher exact test P = 0.015).

Which analytical approach is most useful will depend on the specific question being investigated and may not be apparent beforehand. So while the proper 315 formulation of social evolution theory is sometimes contentious [21, 22] , it is practically useful for empiricists to examine their data from multiple theoretical perspectives [40] .

But then interpreting what these ad hoc analyses tell us about social evolution in microbes is a verbal exercise in which theory is just a heuristic. The theoretical challenge is to formulate mathematical expressions of social selection that can handle the 355 complexities of real microbial fitness data while also enabling quantitative inferences about selection's net effect in a structured population with nonrandom interactions among genotypes. Key to this challenge are strong selection and non-additive fitness effects. Analytically useful formulations of social selection in microbes would be able to generically allow fitness effects that span orders of magnitude and have non-linear, genotype-dependent responses to genotype frequency among social 360 interactants. They would also be expressible in terms of either strain or multilevel fitness outcomes as needed, be robust to different types of biological interaction, and allow quantitative comparisons across very different systems.",

Fisher [50] advocated using log-frequency ratios like ln(q A /q B ) because they allow one to easily distinguish genotype frequencies even when one type is very rare, respond linearly to 375 simple forms of selection, behave symmetrically around zero whether a genotype is rare or common, and have a simple statistical interpretation as the log-odds of sampling one genotype relative to another. One challenge for logarithmic-scale analyses, though, are the zeroes that occur in singlestrain groups and when a genotype becomes undetectible in the final population, both of which occured in the datasets we analyzed.",

Some cases have a straight-forward interpretation, like the one-way mixing effects discussed above, but others are not as obvious. Multiple levels of 385 specificity are possible, from quantitative models tailored to the biology and parameter values of specific systems [46, 48, 33 ] to heuristic models of general biological processes that make simple qualitative predictions [52, 28] . A useful conceptual guide to different types of nonadditivity might lie in evolutionary game theory [53, 54] . In this theoretical framework, genotypes interact to create fitness payoffs whose structure defines the game being played: \"prisoner's dilemma\", \"snowdrift\", 390 etc. There are versions of game theory that can deal with nonadditive payoffs and games with many simultaneous players, though combining these features with structured populations remains an area of theoretical development. Ideally, theory would provide not only a set of tools and models but also a concise, general, quantitative statement about evolution under social selection.",

Applying theory developed for one set of taxa to another very different set can act as a test of that theory's explanatory power. By this measure, both kin and multilevel selection have room for improvement. It is useful to have theory that speaks in same terms as the data, which is why mathematical formulations of social evolution theory have been tailored to the biology and methods of \"organismal\" biology-quantitative genetics for the study of measurable phenotypes with weak selective effects and unknown genetic causes [3, 58] , and ESS models for comparative studies and tests of facultatively adaptive behavior [4] . But microbial science often deals with very different methodologies and data-defined genotypic changes that have large effects on growth and survival under experimentally defined conditions, for example. Fitness is notoriously difficult to measure 415 in metazoa and plants [9] , but for microbes it is one of the most common forms of experimental data. Microbial phenotypes, in fact, can be more difficult to measure. Perhaps it is not surprising that theory developed to understand biological phenomena from one set of taxa loses much of its usefulness when applied to another set with very different biology.",
