Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of xanthine-based acyclic nucleoside phosphonates and evaluation of their activity against a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses. Two acyclic nucleoside phosphonates within the series, namely 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]xanthine (PMEX) and 9-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]xanthine (HPMPX), were shown to possess activity against several human herpesviruses. The most potent compound was PMEX, a xanthine analogue of adefovir (PMEA). PMEX exhibited a single digit mM activity against VZV (EC 50 \u00bc 2.6 mM, TK \u00fe Oka strain) and HCMV (EC 50 \u00bc 8.5 mM, Davis strain), while its hexadecyloxypropyl monoester derivative was active against HSV-1 and HSV-2 (EC 50 values between 1.8 and 4.0 mM). In contrast to acyclovir, PMEX remained active against the TK -VZV 07-1 strain with EC 50 \u00bc 4.58 mM. PMEX was suggested to act as an inhibitor of viral DNA polymerase and represents the first reported xanthine-based acyclic nucleoside phosphonate with potent antiviral properties.",

The main function of housekeeping enzymes is to prevent or minimize the incorporation of noncanonical nucleotides into DNA/ RNA. Unfortunately, the literature on housekeeping enzymes hydrolyzing dXDP/dXTP has been quite rare up to date. Herpesviruses 18 are DNA-containing enveloped viruses from large Herpesviridae family and include herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Although current anti-herpetic therapy uses powerful antivirotics such as nucleoside analogues (acyclovir (ACV), penciclovir, vidarabine, and ganciclovir (GCV)), acyclic nucleoside phosphonate (ANP) cidofovir (CDV) (3, Figure 1 ), 19 or diphosphate mimic foscarnet, 20 many drug insensitive viruses have been identified in the clinics. The origin of virus resistance for HSV, VZV or CMV comes mostly from treatment using DNA polymerase inhibitors, such as ACV and GCV, where various alterations in the viral thymidine kinase gene [UL23 (HSV) and ORF36 (VZV)], protein kinase [UL97 (CMV)] and/or viral DNA polymerase gene [UL30 (HSV), ORF28 (VZV) and UL54 (CMV)] may occur. [21] [22] [23] As recent literature has shown, 24 the presence of resistant herpesviruses should be considered seriously not only in the case of immunocompromised individuals. Evidently, there is an urgent need for novel potent anti-herpetic agents with high barrier of resistance development.",

Recently, we have reported 27 a simple and highyielding synthesis of xanthine ANPs exploiting the MW-assisted hydrolysis of the corresponding 2,6dichloropurine derivatives.

Similarly, phosphonate ester 19 (Scheme 4) bearing a perfluorinated-C12 chain was prepared by the same procedure in a 30% yield. Finally, the bisamidate prodrug 20 (Scheme 4) was obtained in a 13% yield starting from PMEX (4) and isopropyl ester of L-phenylalanine using the previously described procedure developed in our lab. 39 In order to confirm the expected mode of action of PMEX (4), i.e. viral DNA polymerase inhibition, the corresponding phosphonodiphosphate 21 (Scheme 5), as an analogue of natural nucleoside triphosphate, was also prepared. The two-step synthesis via a morpholidate intermediate 40 afforded, after the HPLC purification, the desired triphosphate mimic 21 in a low (3%) yield.",

GCV, CDV, ACV, brivudin (BVDU), zalcitabine, zanamivir, alovudine, amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, dextran sulfate (molecular weight 10000, DS-10000), mycophenolic acid, Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin (HHA), and Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) were used as the reference compounds. The antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 , i.e. compound concentration required to decrease virus plaque formation (VZV) or virusinduced cytopathogenicity (other viruses) by 50%. While none of the compounds showed any activity against RNA viruses, compounds 4, 5 and 6 were able to inhibit the replication of herpesviruses (Tables 1 and 2 ). PMEX (4) emerged as the most active compound against VZV and HCMV, being as active as the reference drug ACV against the TK \u00fe Oka strain (EC 50 \u00bc 2.62 mM (PMEX) versus 3.42 mM (ACV)). In contrast to ACV, compound 4 remained active against the TK -VZV 07-1 strain (EC 50 \u00bc 4.58 mM). PMEX also inhibited the replication of HCMV with EC 50 values of the same order of magnitude as the reference anti-HCMV drug GCV, while PMEX had a 50% cytostatic concentration of 111 mM for HEL cells. Thus, compound 4 was not only potent but also selective as the calculated selectivity indices (ratio CC 50 /EC 50 ) were of 24 and 42 (VZV 07-1 and Oka strains, respectively) and of 11 and 13 (HCMV AD-169 and Davis strains, respectively). Compounds 5 and 6 were, respectively, 6 to 12 folds and 3 to 8 folds less active than PMEX against VZV and HCMV. However, compounds 4, 5 and 6 inhibited the replication of HSV-1, HSV-2 and TK-HSV-1 at equivalent EC 50 values in the range of 16 to 39 mM. PMEX (4) lacked activity against vaccinia virus, while HPMPX compounds (both S-isomer 6 and racemic mixture 5) were weak inhibitors of this poxvirus (EC 50 \u00bc 39 mM, Table 2 ).",

The product was precipitated with diethyl ether (10 ml) and the solid was washed with diethyl ether (10 ml). The precipitated product was dissolved in 0.05 M TEAB (4 ml) and purified on a column packed with POROS V R 50 HQ (50 ml) with use of a gradient of TEAB in water (0.05-0.5 M). The product was co-evaporated several times with water and converted into a sodium salt form (Dowex 50 in Na \u00fe cycle). Lyophylisation afforded 21 (5 mg, 3%) as a white amorphous solid. 1 Biological assays. The compounds were evaluated against different herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) strain KOS, thymidine kinase-deficient (TK-) HSV-1 KOS strain resistant to ACV (ACV r ), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) strain G, VZV strain Oka, TK-VZV strain 07-1, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) strains AD-169 and Davis as well as vaccinia virus, adeno virus-2, vesicular stomatitis virus, para-influenza-3 virus, reovirus-1, Sindbis virus, Coxsackie virus B4, Punta Toro virus, RSV, FIPV and influenza A virus subtypes H1N1 (A/PR/8), H3N2 (A/ HK/7/87) and influenza B virus (B/HK/5/72). The antiviral assays were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, African green monkey kidney cells (Vero), human epithelial cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa), Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells (CRFK), or Madin Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK). Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 PFU, and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation (VZV) was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virusinfected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 or compound concentration required reducing virus-induced cytopathicity or viral plaque formation by 50%.",

Two synthetic approaches were exploited for the synthesis of the target compounds: (a) recently developed MW-assisted hydrolysis of 2,6dichloropurine derivatives and (b) well-established diazotization/2-hydroxy-dediazoniation of the corresponding guanine analogues. All prepared ANPs were tested against a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses. Two compounds exhibited antiviral activity. PMEX (4) was active against VZV, HCMV, HSV-1, and HSV-2 (with EC 50 values between 2.6 and 25.6 mM), while HPMPX (both as S-isomer 6 and as a racemic mixture 5) exhibited moderate to weak activity (EC 50 in the range of 17-43 mM) against VZV, HCMV, HSV-1, HSV-2, and Vaccinia virus. PMEX (4) was the most active compound against VZV in the series (EC 50 \u00bc 2.62 mM, TK \u00fe Oka strain) and was equipotent to the reference drug ACV (EC 50 \u00bc 3.42 mM). In contrast to ACV, PMEX (4), as ANP which activity is independent of the first phosphorylation step, remained active against the TK -VZV 07-1 strain with EC 50 \u00bc 4.58 mM. The hexadecyloxypropyl monoester derivative of PMEX, compound 18, slightly improved the anti-HSV potency of the parent compound (EC 50 values between 1.8 and 4.0 mM). Further studies of PMEX (4) and of its diphosphate analogue PMEXpp (21) suggested that the compound acts as the inhibitor of herpesvirus DNA polymerases (HSV-1 and VZV). This study represents the first report of xanthine containing ANPs with potent antiviral properties and urges further studies of various xanthine nucleotide analogues as potential antiviral agents.",
