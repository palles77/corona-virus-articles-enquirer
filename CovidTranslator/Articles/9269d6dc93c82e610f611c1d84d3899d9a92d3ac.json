Recently reported bronchoscopyassociated infections (BAIs) and pseudoinfections [1] [2] [3] [4] potentially affected \u03fe 800 patients and included instances in which clinically significant infections and fatalities might have been related to the procedure. Such outbreaks have generated major concerns regarding the possibility of iatrogenic infections due to FB and underscore the importance of reappraising this problem and optimizing preventive practices. 5, 6 The potential sequelae of BAI and pseudoinfection are enormous. In addition to the possible morbidity and mortality associated with true infections, such events require expenditure of considerable time and resources for the careful assessment of the vast majority of instances in which no infections or harm to patients have occurred.",

During performance of the procedure, host defenses are bypassed routinely as, most often, the bronchoscope is passed through the upper airways, which are invariably colonized by a myriad of potential pathogens. The patient's cough and other protective reflexes are attenuated purposefully with a variety of medications, ensuring aspiration of microbes, and these and other solutions are instilled routinely into progressively more distal airways, potentially soiling peripheral lung parenchyma. Normal mucosal barriers to infection are disrupted during lung biopsies and an increasing array of interventional procedures. With the latter, lengthier procedure times may increase opportunities for hematogenous as well as local infections. Simultaneously, the progressive miniaturization of bronchoscopes and accessories introduces potential difficulties in effective cleaning and disinfection of these structurally complex instruments. In addition, the prevalence of HIV, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and newly emerging pathogens such as the coronavirus agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) heighten concerns about the relative risks posed by bronchoscopy.",

Alternatively, such events might be systematically underrecognized because of multiple factors. For example, new infection (patient-to-patient) induced by the procedure may be easily masked by the primary signs and symptoms for which FB was performed. In an individual patient, interpretation of a positive culture from a bronchoscopy specimen and the precise differentiation of colonization or infection from instrument contamination may be extraordinarily difficult. This dilemma may be especially problematic in the sickest patients. An individual bronchoscopist may not have access to the comprehensive experience of a bronchoscopy suite in order to discern whether telltale patterns of microbiologic isolates exist among patients undergoing bronchoscopy, and whether these are inappropriate for the patient's clinical presentation. Other reasons for underrecognition of endemic infection may include inadequate surveillance of outpatient procedures, asymptomatic infection or prolonged incubation period prior to the development of the symptoms, and fear of medicolegal ramifications of reporting/publishing devicerelated transmission of infection.",

            "text": "While prevention of infection caused by FB is an obvious concern for all chest clinicians, several observations suggest that there is a widespread unfamiliarity with practice guidelines and that potentially consequential variations in primary and secondary prevention of BAI and pseudoinfections may occur. Although reprocessing guidelines exist, their focal point has been on GI endoscopes. Guidelines addressing bronchoscope reprocessing, for the most part, are derived from those dealing with the GI endoscope. Guidelines for reprocessing of flexible endoscopes, including bronchoscopes, have been promulgated by the Association for Professionals in Infection Control, Association of PeriOperative Registered Nurses, and the British Thoracic Society, among others. 10 -13 Data suggest that these guidelines have not been effectively disseminated and/or followed by many clinicians. A comprehensive survey 14 of bronchoscopists in the United Kingdom revealed that national guidelines for bronchoscope reprocessing were not followed consistently. Minimum disinfection times recommended before and after routine bronchoscopies were often (35%) not achieved, and no disinfection was carried out in 34% of medical centers before emergency bronchoscopies and in 19% of units after suspected cases of tuberculosis. Adequate rinsing of the bronchoscope with sterile or filtered water was not carried out by 43% of units. Staff rarely (7%) wore recommended protective clothing during bronchoscopy. In another survey involving US bronchoscopists, nearly two thirds of respondents, including medical directors of bronchoscopy suites, acknowledged that they were unfamiliar with national reprocessing recommendations. Interestingly, this survey was carried out just following a widely publicized Pseudomonas outbreak involving bronchoscopes. 15 Moreover, many (39%) were not aware of the approaches to reprocessing at their own institutions! Although specific data are unavailable, anecdotal observations suggest that bronchoscope reprocessing techniques are inadequately emphasized during the training of many pulmonary fellows, and many bronchoscopists may take it for granted that the instruments they use are safe.",

We also present principles related to the specific maintenance and disinfection of instruments together with provisional recommendations.

Accordingly, our recommendations represent an evolving perspective that provides numerous important opportunities for clinical outcomes research and that will require future critical refinement. In addition to general principles, the implementation of effective programs is institution specific and requires local modification through continued active dialogue among bronchoscopists, staff, and infection control teams. 16 We would also like to highlight that these recommendations are not intended to ensure the inactivation or removal of causative agents of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (prion proteins).",

A review of the English-language literature from 1970 to 2003 revealed over three hundred references to endoscopy-related transmissions of infection. Sixty-two were specific to FB. Despite published guidelines for the reprocessing of endoscopes, reports of \"true infections\" and \"pseudoinfections\" or \"pseudoepidemics\" related to FB seem to be increasing. Most citations refer to pseudoinfections and pseudoepidemics as the isolation of organisms in bronchoscopy specimens due to colonization or contamination of the bronchoscope rather than true patient-to-patient transmission (\"true infection\") [ Table 1 ]. [1] [2] [3] [4] The majority of reports are descriptive, with few casecontrolled investigations. Typically, episodes can be traced to inadequate cleaning techniques or disinfection processes. Occasionally, the infection is due to contamination of water supplies, reprocessing equip-ment, or accessories such as stopcocks or cleaning brushes. Defects within the bronchoscope itself (suction valve port) have also been implicated in transmission of organisms from patient to patient (Table  2) . 17-42,69 -71,73,74 Only 18 publications have suggested \"true\" infection: the transmission of a specific pathogen associated with a clinically significant illness in a patient undergoing FB (Table 3) . 1,2,18 -20,31,32,42,46,49,53,66 -70,73,75,76 Two of the accounts were reported in 2003, involving 33 patients with three possible deaths.

Recently, the outbreak of SARS-CoV afflicting healthcare providers during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic illustrated the risks of communicable airborne diseases. New evidence suggests that although transmission appears to occur from infectious droplets, there are occasional episodes in which airborne transmission cannot be excluded, including \"aerosol\"-generating procedures such as intubation, bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation, and bronchoscopy. [82] [83] [84] [85] Cases of direct transmission of infectious diseases to staff during bron-choscopy are apparently rare. However, the increased incidence of latent tuberculosis among respiratory therapists and pulmonary fellows compared with other health-care providers suggests that there may be an increased risk to health-care providers who are involved in bronchoscopy procedures. 86, 87 Recommendations We reemphasize that our review of the literature reveals that the infrequent and sporadic recognition of bronchoscopy-related infection hinders development of evidence-based guidelines for this topic. However, review of the available literature suggests that all episodes are preventable. Many of the following recommendations are based on accumulated clinical experience and expert opinions involving several disciplines. The following recommendations have taken into account guidelines published by other societies and organizations. 6,10 -12,88,89 Review of the literature also points out several flaws in current practices; we highlight measures to avoid such mistakes.",

The outside of the bronchoscope should be wiped with a detergent-soaked gauze piece and detergent solution suctioned through the channel. All suction ports or biopsy attachments should be detached prior to leak testing, further cleaning, and inspecting the instrument for any damage. All disposable items must be discarded. The instrument should then be pressurized with a leak tester to detect any damage that could have occurred during the procedure. The bronchoscope is then fully immersed in water to confirm or to rule out any air leaks. Flexion and extension of the bending section should be performed under water to detect any minute leaks that may not be visualized otherwise. The presence of a leak indicates a breach in the integrity of the external or the luminal surface of the instrument. Such puncture sites and breaches will develop concretions of debris (blood, mucus) that cannot be disinfected. Any instrument with a positive leak test result should not be reused until fully repaired (Fig 4) . Only after ensuring that there are no air leaks should an enzymatic cleaner be added to the water. Next, the bronchoscope should be soaked in cleaning solution for approximately 5 min. The external surface of the bronchoscope should be cleaned/wiped manually with an enzymatic detergent. Detergent solution or water is then flushed through all ports to loosen organic debris. The detergent preparation should not be reused. A cleaning brush of an appropriate size then should be passed multiple times through all ports of the instrument.

Cleaning brushes should either be for single use or should receive mechanical cleaning followed by sterilization or high-level disinfection after each use. 28 Finally the instrument and its channel should be rinsed with water to remove the enzymatic cleaner and prepare it for disinfection.",

(4) Remove all disposable parts (suction/ biopsy valve). (5) Perform leak test before immersing the instrument in water. (6) Any instrument that fails the leak test must be removed from service until repaired. (7) Add enzymatic cleaner to the water and soak the instrument for 5 min. (8) Using the enzymatic solution, wipe external surfaces with wet gauze and flush the suction channel.
