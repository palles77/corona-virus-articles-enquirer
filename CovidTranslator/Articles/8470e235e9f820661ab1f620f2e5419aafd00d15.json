This study aimed to assess ED nurses' burnout level during an outbreak of MERS-CoV and to identify influencing factors in order to provide basic information for lowering and preventing the level of burnout. Methods: Study participants were ED nurses working in eight hospitals designated for treating MERS-CoV-infected patients in Korea. We performed multiple regression analysis to explore the factors influencing burnout. Results: The ED nurses' burnout was affected by job stress (b \u00bc 0.59, p < .001), poor hospital resources for the treatment of MERS-CoV (b \u00bc \u00c00.19, p < .001) and poor support from family and friends (b \u00bc \u00c00.14, p < .05). These three variables explained 47.3% of the variance in burnout. Conclusions: ED nurses taking care of MERS-CoV-infected patients should be aware that burnout is higher for nurses in their divisions than nurses in other hospital departments and that job stress is the biggest influential factor of burnout. To be ready for the outbreak of emerging contagious diseases such as MERS-CoV, efforts and preparations should be made to reduce burnout. Job stress should be managed and resolved. Working conditions for mitigating job stress and systematic stress management programs should be provided, and hospital resources for the treatment of MERS-CoV need to be reinforced. Moreover, promoting support from family and friends is required.",

Consequently, ED nurses are the first healthcare professionals to care for patients infected with the novel contagious disease. In fact, there were many cases of exposure to the disease in EDs during the MERS-CoV outbreak [3] . Compared to nurses in other areas, ED nurses are faced with hectic, unpredictable, and ever-changing situations [4] . Because they deal with various diseases, traumatic events, and urgent situations, they do not have enough time for recovery, putting them under persistent stress. As a result, ED nurses are reported to experience much higher burnout than nurses in other hospital departments [5e7] . Burnout is a longterm consequence of prolonged exposure to certain job demands and a reaction that appears when a person can no longer endure the stress they have been undergoing [8] . It is a syndrome of physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion that includes a negative selfconcept and work attitude, and a reduced interest in patients [8] . It has also been strongly associated with working conditions in nursing [5e8], leading it to be the focus of many nursing studies [4e10] .",

Although varying between studies, the factors influencing burnout have been largely divided into individual factors and work-related factors [5, 9] . Individual factors reported in previous studies include demographic characteristics such as gender, age, religion, education level [5, 9] , having children, living with family [10] , job stress [7, 11] , personality, coping strategies, and job attitude [5, 9] .

Similarly, when severe acute respiratory syndrome such as SARS spread rapidly, most nurses experienced severe stress, and some nurses refused to care for patients [12, 13] . In addition, the factors influencing nurses' desire to leave their jobs during an outbreak of SARS were identified as the perceived risk of fatality from SARS, tenure, work stress, and social relationships [13] . When H5N1 avian flu spread rapidly, Taiwanese nurses' fear of infection from the disease was a significant factor influencing their willingness to care for patients infected with the avian flu [14] . Since an emerging respiratory infectious disease such as MERS-CoV can happen anywhere in the world, nursing managers need to pay attention to ED nurses' burnout in association with their experiences of a nationwide MERS-CoV outbreak. However, not even a basic survey has been conducted on the level of burnout experienced by ED nurses, who are in the front line taking care of MERS-CoV patients, or factors of burnout that consider the specific nature of MERS-CoV. Thus, this study attempted to assess ED nurses' burnout level during an outbreak of MERS-CoV and to identify influencing factors in order to provide basic information for lowering and preventing the level of burnout.",

The OLBI, a burnout scale suggested by Demerouti et al [18] , is an adequate scale for assessing the emotional aspects of exhaustion, including its physical and cognitive elements [16,18e20] . The study of Hopper et al [6] , which surveyed ER nurses' burnout level using Maslach's Burnout Inventory, reported that 22.4% and 19.2% of ED nurses experienced a high level of burnout, respectively. In particular, a systematic review of 17 studies that surveyed burnout in ED nurses reported that 25.9% of them experienced emotional exhaustion exceeding the cut-off score [5] . Another study reported that burnout among ordinary nurses, midwives and nurses with some sort of specialization surveyed using the OLBI, was 2.40 on a 5-point scale [21] . Accordingly, the burnout level surveyed in this study using the OLBI shows that the participants' experience of burnout was above average compared to other nurses dealing with burnout in general. This suggests a need to pay particular attention to burnout in ER nurses who are on the front line in treating MERS-CoV-infected or MERS-CoV-suspected patients. This also suggests the necessity for programs designed to help manage and control burnout levels in ED nurses during the outbreak of an infectious disease like MERS-CoV.",

Shift work is a major factor in increasing MERS-CoV-related burnout not only for ER nurses but also for nurses in other departments [22] . However, in some studies, shift work was not a factor influencing burnout [5, 9] . In this study, although shift work did not show a significant relationship with MERS-CoV-related burnout for ED nurses, it may have an indirect effect on MERS-CoV-related burnout. Therefore, the ED nurses who came into contact with MARS-CoV-related patients, their burnout need to be monitored by reducing their shift work. Previous studies have reported that repeated exposure to traumatic events causes burnout in nurses [23, 24] . It has also been found that when ED nurses have been exposed to traumatic events, they experience higher emotional exhaustion than those without such exposure [25] . Consistent with previous reports, the burnout level in this study was significantly higher in ED nurses who cared for MERS-CoV-infected or MERS-CoV-suspected patients during the nationwide outbreak of the disease. This finding supports the proposal that the outbreak of MERS-CoV was a traumatic event for which nurses' burnout needs to be managed.",

Thus, during the outbreak of an emerging infectious disease such as MERS-CoV, the continuous inflow of patients and the highly infectious nature of the disease increase ED nurses' stress, which in turn, aggravates their burnout [7] .

This finding is consistent with the systematic review [5] and literature review [7] , which reported that hospital resources and support from family and friends were major influencing factors for ED nurses' burnout [5, 7] . In particular, a lack of material resources is reported to be correlated with a high level of burnout [22] . These findings suggest that, in preparation for the outbreak of an emerging infectious disease, hospitals should prepare facilities for preventing infection, establish systematic infection control guidelines, and continue discussions about preventive measures [13, 14] . What is more, support from family and friends experienced as more extensive social support, was found to be another influencing factor, as reported in previous studies [5, 9] . In the context of employment, typical sources of social support are coworkers, supervisors, and the organization in general. Social support from one's supervisor and colleagues is found to provide a buffering effect that directly or indirectly reduces job stress [5, 9, 12, 14] . Accordingly, it is suggested that the aspect of social support from an employee's supervisor and colleagues should be taken into consideration for further research in future studies. If social support is provided in consideration of national and cultural factors, it may reduce burnout in nurses caring for patients in such a national crisis as the outbreak of MERS-CoV [12, 14] .",

The outcome of this study is expected to provide basic information related to ED nurses' burnout in connection to an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease such as MERS-CoV and to contribute to programs and strategies for reducing burnout. In order to lower the level of burnout, nursing managers need to make efforts to reduce job stress, to reinforce hospital resources for the treatment of MERS-CoV, and to promote support from family and friends.
