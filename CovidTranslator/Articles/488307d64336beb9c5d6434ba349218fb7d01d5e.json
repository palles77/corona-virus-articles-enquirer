Yet the vast majority of empirical studies consider wildlife pathogens and parasites only if they threaten the health of humans or their domestic animals, and often overlook their natural history. Partly this reflects the priorities of funding agencies; and their concerns are not trivial. More than 70% of emerging (or re-emerging) pathogens of humans are thought to have wild animals as their natural reservoirs (Taylor et al., 2001) . Examples include SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), avian influenza A (H5N1) virus (bird flu), NIPAH virus, hantavirus and West Nile virus. The economic imperative for controlling zoonoses that affect domestic stock can be very strong. For example, bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in the United Kingdom undoubtedly has a reservoir in wild badger populations, and the direct cost of the disease to agriculture is projected to reach \u00a31 billion by 2011 (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), 2004).",

This can either be through direct mortality, where losses are greater than the birth rate, or through effects on birth rate, longevity and survival, which suppress the population size to a level that renders it susceptible to extinction by stochastic effects (Table 8 .1). Generalist pathogens with a wide host range are particularly problematic, since even virulent species can persist in alternative hosts while driving the rare host to extinction (Begon and Bowers, 1995) . Although remaining low on the list of priorities compared with other threats such as habitat loss, efforts are therefore sometimes now made to control infectious diseases for conservation reasons. Examples of recent successes include the control of canine distemper virus in black-footed ferrets (Mustela nigripes) (Williams et al., 1988) , and rabies in African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) (Hofmayer et al., 2004) and Ethiopian wolves (Canis simensis) (Haydon et al., 2004) .",

For many other infectious agents, such as Cryptosporidium parvum, the epidemiological role of wildlife is unknown. Despite the many attempts to control zoonoses in wildlife, the success rate is poor. Typically, measures are adopted as crisis management (usually in the form of culling) following an outbreak, with little understanding of the ecology of species or its relationship to the pathogen. Crisis management also means that proper scientific designs with appropriate controls are often lacking; it is therefore difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of a given intervention. Even where there is a long history of attempts to control a disease through the management of a wildlife reservoir, the results have not been encouraging. For example, efforts over the last 30 years to control bTB in cattle in the United Kingdom by culling of badgers has failed to yield significant benefits, with analyses of the recent randomised controlled trial of badger culling concluding that culling could not contribute meaningfully to future control strategies for bTB (Donnelly et al., 2005) . Similarly, the culling of foxes has been discounted as a means of rabies control in western Europe (Blancou et al., 1991) . However, success has been achieved through the use of widespread vaccination (administered via bait) (Aubert, 1995) . Rabies is currently the only example of a widespread strategy of vaccination being favoured over the control of the host species (Artois et al., 2001) .",

            "text": "This review considers the ecology of zoonoses in wildlife and the links between infection in wildlife and humans or livestock. It proposes that a shift to ecologically based control, explicitly considering the natural history of wildlife hosts and their pathogens, is crucial in minimising the risk presented to humans, domestic animals and endangered species from zoonoses. This approach will also yield benefits for the conservation and welfare status of wild animals. Notwithstanding the complexities of specific relationships, the probability of a zoonosis being passed from wildlife into another host population, be it humans, domestic stock or an endangered wild species, is always influenced by several key parameters. These are the intensity of infection in the reservoir hosts; the size, or depending on the case, the density, of the infected host population; the degree and nature of the contact between infected individuals (or infectious particles in the environment such as infected faeces); and the susceptibility of the in-contact animal. (For indirectly transmitted parasites and pathogens, the role of vectors and/or intermediate hosts must also be considered.) Whether the zoonosis persists after initial invasion is also determined by the new host's population size. A great variety of models has been developed to describe the transmission dynamics of macro-and microparasites, taking into account the nuances of particular host and parasite population structures (Diekmann and Heesterbeek, 2000; Heesterbeek and Roberts, 1995; Scott, 1988; Scott and Smith, 1994 ). Yet empirical research has lagged behind the theoretical advances. The legacy of researchers like Elton and Chitty (Chitty, 1952 (Chitty, , 1954 Elton, 1931; Elton et al., 1931 Elton et al., , 1935 , who sought not only to describe pathogens but to understand their ecological role, has not been sustained. (There are a few notable exceptions, including the long-term studies of small mammals in the north of England (Beldomenico et al., 2008a,b; Feore et al., 1997) ; rodent reservoirs of hantavirus in the United States (Calisher et al., 2007; Mills et al., 1997) and macroparasite infections in laboratory models (Ehman and Scott, 2004; Scott, 1988; Scott and Anderson, 1984; Scott and Smith, 1987) .) This deficiency was noted in a key text in the field in 1995 (Grenfell and Dobson, 1995) and again in the follow-up publication in 2002 (Hudson et al., 2002) .",

While pathogens that affect international trade are reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and many of these affect wildlife (see Artois et al., 2001) for the lengthy list of those likely to affect wildlife in Europe), there is no agreed systematic programme of surveillance (Kulken et al., 2005) . Even where programmes exist, they lack integration with surveillance in humans and domestic animals at both local and international scales. Disease surveillance in wildlife is usually driven by outbreaks in humans or domestic animals (Childs, 2004) . Virulent pathogens are, therefore, more likely to be detected than more benign ones (Williamson et al., 1986) . Such studies are also, by their nature, not designed to screen for a range of pathogens, so opportunities to investigate the epidemiology and ecology of coinfections are often lost. Systematic surveillance of representative samples of the population is difficult and time consuming. Yet prevalence estimates can be seriously skewed if the only data available are derived from passive surveillance of carcasses. Not only are estimates likely to be too high if they are based on samples of wildlife found dead or sick by the public, but even road kills and game bags are likely to over-represent certain population classes (such as dispersing juvenile male mammals) and animals in compromised health.",

For example, many of the 'spectacular' epidemics derived from bat viruses, such as Hendra virus, Nipah virus, SARS-CoV-like virus, have been observed only a small number of times. We do not know why this should be the case. Is transfer of zoonoses from bats to terrestrial vertebrates generally rare due to a lack of appropriate contact? Or is there regular inter-specific transmission of other viruses but these go undetected because they lack the extreme pathogenicity of Hendra and Nipah viruses to stimulate screening efforts? Pro-active surveillance of wildlife and of apparently healthy human or livestock populations could help answer these questions.",

The first recorded European bat rabies case was in Hamburg in 1954 and several other cases were identified subsequently (King et al., 2004 ). Yet surveillance of bats was not really pursued until a woman in Denmark was bitten by a serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus) infected with European bat Lyssavirus 1 (EBLV1). Since then more than 800 rabies-positive bats have been identified across Europe; the vast majority being serotine bats infected with EBLV-1 (Harris et al., 2006) . In the United Kingdom, screening efforts were intensified following the death of a man in Scotland from EBLV-2 in 2002, after apparent contact with many bats in the United Kingdom and Europe (Fooks et al., 2003) . In contrast with classical rabies (RABV) there is now good evidence that at least some bats (and possibly other animals) can produce neutralising antibodies and survive EBLV infection for at least 6 years (Serra-Cobo et al., 2002; van der Poel et al., 2000) , and experimental models suggest that EBLV-2 might be inherently less virulent than EBLV-1 (Vos et al., 2004) . EBLV-2 also appears to have a much more restricted geographical range than EBLV-1, and small numbers of positive bats have been identified in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), 2008; Racey et al., 2004; Vos, 2007; Vos et al., 2007) . These cases have all been in the closely related Daubenton's (Myotis daubentoni) and pond bats (M. dasycneme).",

The serotine bat occurs over most of Europe, extending north to 55 latitude (England south of the Wash estuary, Denmark and southern Sweden); Daubenton's bats are common across Europe; and the pond bat is present in a wide band across central and eastern Europe (between 48 and 60 latitude; absent from the United Kingdom (Schober and Grimmberger, 1997) ). Yet neither EBLV-1 nor EBLV-2 appears throughout their hosts' ranges. Some suggest that in the case of EBLV-1, this may be because long-distance travel is uncommon in serotines, the primary host (Vos et al., 2007) . Yet the species is widely distributed, and it is unlikely that there are gaps between populations that could not be travelled with relative ease; dispersing movements of up to 300 km have also been recorded (Hutterer et al., 2005) . Interestingly, EBLV-2 also appears to have a patchy distribution, despite its host species, at least in continental Europe, being migratory over long distances (Vos, 2007) . Whether the geographical distribution is, in reality, less patchy than it currently appears requires co-ordinated surveillance effort and a willingness by statutory authorities to publish test results even if they are negative. It is clear that active surveillance (systematic screening of bats in the wild) has been undertaken in a few countries only, and passive surveillance (submission of dead bats by members of the public for screening) has involved few, if any, animals in a number of European countries, including Portugal, Ireland, Greece, the Czech Republic and Slovakia (Racey et al., 2004) .",

Undoubtedly, the numbers of bats of each species submitted by the public does not match their abundance in the wild, but is influenced by the closeness of their contact with humans (and their cats, which are a major cause of bat mortality). For example, few woodland specialists have been submitted, whereas bats that frequently roost in houses, particularly pipistrelles, long-eared bats and possibly serotines, are over-represented (Harris et al., 2006) .

The common pipistrelle bat is known to be susceptible to experimental infection with EBLV-1 (Kuzmin and Botvinkin, 1996) . Yet none of the more than 10,000 pipistrelles (P. pipistrellus and also P. pygmaeus, which is cryptic with P. pipistrellus) surveyed in the Netherlands, France and the United Kingdom (Harris et al., 2006; Picard-Meyer et al., 2006; van der Poel et al., 2005) has proved positive for the virus. Whether structuring across bat species driven by differing immunoresponsiveness to particular EBLV types, by a lack of transmission opportunities or by other mechanisms, is unclear. Multi-species summer, and particularly hibernation, roosts are known, though the amount of inter-specific direct contact appears to vary by season and species. For example, bats in houses and trees tend to use single-species roosts, even if more than one species is present at the site (Park et al., 1996) . There may be more potential for inter-specific contact at key underground sites used by bats. In a survey of more than 76,000 bats of 13 different species roosting in caves in Turkey, it was noted that multi-species clusters frequently occurred in the post-hibernation season, but not during hibernation; and the horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) only ever formed single-species clusters (Furman and \u00d6 zg\u00fc l, 2004) . Many bat species also use swarming sites-enclosed areas often in and around caves-for display purposes. At these sites, hundreds or thousands of bats of mixed species congregate (Glover and Altringham, 2008; Parsons et al., 2003) . The amount of contact, for example, via urine or aerosol droplets, between species at these events is unknown. More field research is needed to investigate the opportunities for disease transmission across bat species, and across geographical barriers.",

To date, seven Daubenton' bats (Myotis daubentoni) in the United Kingdom have been found to have EBLV-2 infection (DEFRA, 2008) , the latest case being diagnosed in May 2008. It is notable that although a low prevalence (around 2%) of seropositivity was detected during active surveillance of Daubenton's bats in Scotland, live virus was not isolated from any of them (Brookes et al., 2005) . Similar results were found in an active-surveillance study in Spain, which found that up to 60% of individuals in some colonies were seropositive for EBLV-1, but the prevalence of active infection was less than 1.1% (Serra-Cobo et al., 2002) . It is currently difficult to interpret these results, but the vertical transmission of antibodies, as well as acquired immunity, is a possibility.",

It is unfortunate that there was been no serological testing of bat workers in the United Kingdom to establish the natural prevalence of neutralising antibodies to EBLVs prior to 2002. Since that date, following the fatality in Scotland from EBLV-2, it has been officially recommended that bat handlers be vaccinated against rabies. The take-up rate of vaccination has been very high. This understandable management of the public-health crisis means that it is now not possible to gather information that would have helped indicate the pathogenicity of EBLV-2 to humans, and also whether exposure was more widespread than the single fatal case. It certainly appears that despite other species being susceptible in experiments, natural spillover into other non-bat hosts to produce clinical symptoms is rare, with the only known case for EBLV-1 being a single stone marten .

Even assuming that a reasonably random cohort can be sampled, there is usually no opportunity to repeat 'live-tests' in cases of diagnostic uncertainty. Establishing values for other key parameters is equally problematic. Fundamental data on the sex-and age-distributions of infection are often not recorded. Sometimes this is because the surveys (particularly for 'crisis management') were not designed with research in mind. Sometimes it is practically difficult for the data to be acquired. Bats, for example, can live more than 30 years, yet it is impossible in the absence of long-term banding studies on the particular population being surveyed, to judge the age of animals with much greater accuracy than 'juvenile', 'young of the year', and 'adult'. Weight is frequently used as a surrogate for age or maturity, particularly in studies of rodents, but there can be difficulties in distinguishing age from dominance effects, since both are correlated with body mass. The size of the population (or its density) is also often estimated with huge margins of error, as surveyors simply lack the time to undertake detailed ecological studies in addition to collecting clinical samples.",

Initially they assumed that no between-species transmission was present. Using the prevalence of infectious individuals, together with field data on population structure and density derived from the same sites, they computed the basic reproductive number R 0 for each of the species. The analyses showed that even when the maximum likely prevalence was assumed (based on the upper 95% confidence limit), the R 0 (the basic reproductive rate of the disease) ranged from just 1.003 in wood mice to 1.05 in rats. (The lower confidence intervals for prevalence always gave R 0 values that were <1.0; Mathews et al., 2006b .) It is therefore unlikely that the disease would persist within single-host systems in the wild: the animals are unable to pass on the infection to their conspecifics at a rate high enough to maintain the disease. The findings are robust to underdiagnosis of infection: to affect the R 0 materially, the prevalences would need to be have been underestimated very substantially. If, instead of single-host models, we assumed multiple-host systems, then higher prevalences should have been observed in the field than those recorded. Alternatively, to achieve the prevalences seen in reality, the withinspecies transmission rate would have to be even lower than the very low value calculated. They have therefore been able to conclude that multi-species transmission of bTB within farmland wildlife communities appears unlikely.",

Using longterm datasets, with repeated trapping at set grids, the teams were able to explore key components of the transmission pathway. Seropositivity was higher in males and in heavier animals, suggesting horizontal transmission among adult males. Decreasing prevalence with age among the youngest deer mice suggests that infected dams confer passive immunity to pups. In the main host of Sin Nombre virus, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), gender, age, wounding, season and local relative population densities were linked with the period prevalence of antibody (used as a marker of infection). Nevertheless, antibody prevalence and some of the risk factors associated with antibody prevalence, such as relative population density, gender bias and prevalence of wounding, varied significantly among sites and even between nearby trapping arrays at a single site. This suggests that local micro-site-specific differences play an important role in determining relative risk of infection in rodents and, consequently, in humans. These data are now being used in spatially explicit models of the risk of human disease outbreaks (Eisen et al., 2007) .",

Since the early 1990s, outbreaks of rabies and canine distemper virus (CDV) have had significant impacts on wolf population dynamics Randall et al., 2004 Randall et al., , 2006 . These diseases are maintained in local domestic dog populations, and a programme of dog vaccination was therefore introduced in 1996, with the aim of reducing the population of susceptible dogs and hence the risk of transmission to wolves. Attempts were made to achieve coverage of more than 70% of susceptible dogs during annual vaccination campaigns. This was not an easy task since dogs in Ethiopia are used for guarding cattle and are not tame. Rabies vaccines have high efficacy, and in theory, this level of coverage should prevent rabies outbreaks 95% of the time (Coleman and Dye, 1996; World Health Organization, 2004) . Over 30,000 vaccinations have taken place, and at least initially, the number of rabies cases in dogs declined (Randall et al., 2006) . Nevertheless, a rabies outbreak occurred in wolves in 2003, and could be linked with more than 35 sympatric dogs with clinical symptoms consistent with rabies . Mathews has, therefore, been analysing the reasons for the apparent failure of the vaccination strategy, focusing on the population dynamics of the domestic dogs, using data collected by the Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme. The key factor appears to be the growth of the dog population, which, as in other African countries, is keeping pace with, or even outstripping, human populations (Cleaveland et al., 2000; Rhodes et al., 1998) . Eighty-six percent of all households owned dogs, rising to 93.5% in rural areas. Virtually nothing is known about the true contact rate between domestic dogs and Ethopian wolves. It is clear that interactions do occur as wolf-dog hybrids are seen. We might speculate that diseased dogs, and aggressive dogs that are difficult to vaccinate, might be even more likely to interact with wolves than would healthy ones.",

This study showed that bTB does not spread rapidly at high incidence through badger populations, but rather is distributed patchily among a minority of individuals. Social groups are relatively stable, and long-term dispersal movements are uncommon, though shorter movements do occur more regularly (Rogers et al., 1998; Vicente et al., 2007) . There is a correlation between rates of inter-group movement and the incidence of new infections (Rogers et al., 1998; Vicente et al., 2007) . While spatial clusters of infection exist, there is no strong synchrony between neighbouring groups, suggesting that there is only limited transmission between adjacent social groups (Delahay et al., 2000) . Both individuals and groups are more likely to be incident cases where the social group was diminishing in size, although there is no apparent relationship with group size itself, suggesting that it is the change in group size, and possibly the associated social dynamics, that influences disease risk (Vicente et al., 2007) .",

(2006) found that badger social group ranges increased among survivors within reactive and pro-active culling areas and along the perimeters of pro-active culling areas. Their finding, at a large scale, accords closely with the observations of of individual and group behaviour in two zones of badger removal in England, as well as those of O' Corry-Crowe et al. (1996) in Ireland. In all cases, the spatial organisation of social groups was considerably altered following the culls, with a large increase in the extent of overlaps between social groups (e.g., Fig. 8.1) . The numbers of ranges with which each group overlapped also increased. There was a rather chaotic alteration in population densities (e.g., Fig. 8.2) . In the examples shown, culling was conducted in 1995, largely targeting areas of highest badger density (in effect, the largest social groups). One year later badger density was, unsurprisingly, lower in the culled areas, whereas there had been some increases elsewhere. In 1997, although the population as a whole had not grown, the density remained low, or even fell further, in two removal areas, but increased elsewhere. By 1998 and 1999, the distribution of badgers in the study area was radically different from that at the outset, with some previously high density, but culled, areas remaining depauperate . Thus, while the population density recovered as a whole, the badgers built up in a different place. This sort of radical redistribution has not been reported in undisturbed populations. The changes have not only implications for absolute contact rates, but also the nature of contacts. For example, bite-wounds-an important route of bTB transmission-were more common in the Macdonald et al. ( ) study following social perturbation. 1995 1996 (post-cull) FIGURE 8.1 Badger social territories before and after the selective removal of social groups following bTB incidents in local farms.",

            "text": "Rather than attempt to control disease by vaccination or culling, an alternative approach is to understand the factors leading to disease outbreaks in the first place and to manage these (Dobson, 2005) . Habitat changes that lead to alterations in population structure or migratory patterns, for example, are likely to affect the risk of zoonotic disease transmission (Dobson and May, 1986) . The effect of habitat fragmentation on disease processes has rarely been investigated, but it has recently been shown that Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates are higher in fragmented than continuous Atlantic forest (Vaz et al., 2007) ; and the risk of Lyme disease in New York is also apparently increased by fragmentation (Allan et al., 2003) . Interestingly, the division of endangered Ethiopian wolf population into small sub-populations, joined by habitat corridors, has been shown to allow rabies control to be achieved using a low-coverage vaccination strategy (Haydon et al., 2004) . The strategy operates by eliminating the largest outbreaks of disease, and so enhances meta-population persistence, rather than by the conventional objective of reducing the reproductive number of the disease to less than one (Haydon et al., 2004) . Human activities that artificially increase, rather than decrease, animal densities also influence disease processes. These increases can be the result of losses of absolute habitat area, or from the provision of supplementary food or water. In the United States, the practice of supplementary feeding of house finches and white-tailed deer has lead to an increase in the incidence of mycoplasmal diseases and bTB, respectively (Hartup et al., 1998; Schmitt et al., 1997) , presumably because of greater opportunities for disease transmission, and possibly also immunosuppressive effects of aggression at the feeding sites. bTB has also been an intractable problem in the British cattle herd, with the incidence rising inexorably since 1979. With a cull of badgers recently being ruled out, somewhat controversially, as offering no meaningful contribution to the long-term control of the disease (Donnelly et al., 2005) , it is worth asking whether consideration of the ecology of the badgers and cattle might help generate workable solutions. Over the past 30 years, along with the increase of bTB, there has also been an increase in badger densities, and it is likely that this contributes at least in part to the disease in cattle. So why have badger populations risen? Might the answer lie in changes in land use? Macdonald and Newman (2006) speculate on a possible role for climate change, with milder winters and hence greater earthworm availability improving survival rates.",

Similarly, stress resulting from cull-associated social perturbations, or from other changes to habitat, food availability or population density, may have influenced the innate immune response of badgers. Little is known of the physiological responses of free-living wild mammals to poor environmental quality or other potential stressors. An argument has been made for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other pollutants contributing to phocine distemper outbreaks (Ross et al., 1996 (Ross et al., , 2000 , but this is has been questioned (O'hea, 2000) .

Reduced risk of bTB was associated with the management of farmland in ways favourable to wildlife, including greater hedgerow availability, a lack of gaps in hedgerows, increasing hedgerow width and the presence of ungrazed wildlife strips adjacent to hedgerows. All of these measures are encouraged by recent European Common Agricultural Policy reforms (2005) . Broadly, habitat could influence cattle contact rates or be associated with agricultural management practices in ways relevant to bTB transmission (such as reduced herd size).

In absolute terms, this equates to the annual risk of bTB changing from the current rate of 9.2% (2,152 confirmed incidents in 23,471 herds in 2004) to 8.1% (1,901 incidents) for herds in the west of England if a policy of moderate hedgerow density increase were adopted. This would mean a reduction of 251 infected herds per year. By comparison, systematic badger culling appears able to reduce the odds of bTB by a maximum of about 19% and may even increase the prevalence in neighbouring areas (Donnelly et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "Change in land use has also been linked to the emergence of two henipaviruses, Nipah virus and Hendra virus in the 1990s, and land use management may therefore offer part of the solution. Both viruses appear to be asymptomatic in their natural hosts, fruit bats (genus Pteropus). They are amplified in domestic animals, pigs and horses, respectively, where they cause mortality, and can then be passed on to humans (Chua et al., 2000; Halpin et al., 2000) . The closeness of RNA sequence match between Pteropus sp., livestock and human isolates of each virus suggests that a sudden change in virulence is a less likely explanation of their rapid emergence into domestic animals and humans than is the ecological change that have affected the habitat of their natural hosts. Many flying fox species are in decline, with roosting and feeding sites being deforested, and converted to agricultural or urban use. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain exactly how Nipah virus emerged (see Breed et al., 2006) , all of which involve the establishment of piggeries in previously forested regions still used by fruit bats (Chua et al., 2002) . Increased contact rates are also the likely explanation for the emergence of Hendra virus in Australia, with many Pteropus populations having relocated into urban areas (Hall and Richards, 2000) . With no vaccine available, and Pteropus in need of conservation, ecologically based strategies to limit contact rates between bats and livestock offer the best prospects of controlling the disease (Field and Mackenzie, 2004) .",

It is also fundamentally important: virtually all emerging infectious diseases have originated in wildlife. Superficially, the simplest method of control is via a reduction in reservoir host-disease prevalence, this being achieved by culls of host populations. However, effective reductions in population densities can be difficult to achieve in practice and may be undesirable where the target is of conservation concern. For example, most bat species are threatened, and yet they appear to be particularly important sources of emerging viruses (Calisher et al., 2006; Dobson, 2005) ; and despite not being endangered, badgers in the United Kingdom are legally protected. An alternative, and possibly complementary, strategy is to manage the ecological conditions leading to disease spill-overs. This will not only benefit the health of humans and their domestic stock, but must surely also lead to benefits for the conservation and welfare of wild animals.",
