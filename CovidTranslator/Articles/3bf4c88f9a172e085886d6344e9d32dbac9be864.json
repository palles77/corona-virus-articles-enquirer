The high prevalence of coronary artery aneurysm/ectasia and its associated cardiovascular morbidity in untreated children is well characterized [2] . Kawasaki disease is now the leading cause of pediatric acquired heart disease in the USA [3] . Prompt treatment with high-dose intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) reduces the incidence of coronary artery abnormalities from 18 to 4 % [4] . However, significant gaps remain in our understanding of KD. The underlying etiology remains unknown. Epidemiological studies have recently attributed the possible source of the etiologic agent of KD to northern China with subsequent spread to Japan via tropospheric winds [5\u2022] .",

The extent and permanence of vascular damage depends upon the scope of involvement of vascular inflammation. Mild inflammation and damage generally preserves the internal and external elastic lamina, which may cause mild dilation but allows the arteries to maintain its normal morphology. As the severity of the inflammation increases, the internal and external elastic lamina is destroyed resulting in progressively larger aneurysms. These aneurysms may be fusiform (from mild SA/C vasculitis) or saccular (from severe SA/C vasculitis or NA). These aneurysms are at risk for rupture or development of thrombosis. Thrombosis may result in ischemia/myocardial infarction or can undergo organization and ultimately recanalization [14] .

Therefore, accurate differentiation between the incidental detection of adenovirus in patients with KD and primary adenoviral disease is essential to avoid the subsequent mortality/morbidity associated with undiagnosed KD. Prolonged fever and elevated inflammatory markers are common features of adenovirus infection and KD. The most commonly described clinical feature of KD compared to adenoviral infection reported in a cohort study was conjunctivitis. Features of adenovirus conjunctivitis include unilateral onset, prominence of tearing more frequently than purulence, and follicular hyperplasia. Additionally, adenovirus often presents with pharyngoconjunctival fever, characterized by nonexudative or exudative pharyngitis in addition to conjunctivitis.

In 2007, a randomized controlled trial by Newburger et al. showed that the addition of one dose of IVMP therapy to initial IVIG infusion did not reduce the prevalence of coronary artery abnormalities or total length of hospital stay [40] . In Japan, the study on the efficacy of IVIG and steroids in patients with severe presentation of KD (RAISE study), a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoints trial, showed combination treatment with IVIG and prednisolone had significant advantages over IVIG alone in the prevention of coronary artery abnormalities with rapid defervescence of fever and normalization of inflammatory markers [41\u2022] . Severe KD was determined through a risk score evaluation of five points or higher per Kobayashi risk score scale, which predicts a >30 % probably of nonresponsiveness to initial IVIG treatment (Table 2 ) [42] . There were significant differences in corticosteroid regimen between the two trials. The median start time of therapy in the RAISE study was 2 days earlier than in the trial by Newburger et al. Additionally, the steroid dosage of the RAISE study was IV prednisone 2 mg/kg divided three times a day over 5 days followed by titration to oral prednisolone dosed at 2 mg/kg/day until resolution of fever and improvement in inflammatory markers. The median duration of steroid therapy in the RAISE study was 21 days. This is a significant increase in total steroid dose as compared to the single dose of 30 mg/kg methylprednisolone in the Newburger study. The earlier initiation of IVIG and corticosteroid therapy with subsequent increased steroid treatment duration was associated with significantly lower rates of coronary artery abnormalities in the RAISE study. This may be a result of early suppression of vasculitis that precedes vascular remodeling due to early initiation of corticosteroid therapy. The addition of corticosteroid therapy to the initial treatment regimen of KD is not the standard of care at this time.",

During the acute phase of KD, TNF-\u03b1 is markedly elevated and degree of elevation has been correlated to the development of coronary artery abnormalities [43] . The most commonly used regimen is one infliximab infusion dosed at 5 mg/kg. Two retrospective reviews of patients with refractory KD treated with infliximab showed complete resolution of symptoms in majority of patients with refractory KD following administration of infliximab [44, 45] . Additionally, a recent pilot study randomized 43 patients with KD refractory to initial IVIG infusion to receive either repeat IVIG (2 gm/kg) or infliximab (5 mg/kg). Treatment with infliximab was associated with shortened duration of fever and lengths of hospitalization and possible reduction in the need for retreatment [46\u2022] . The effects of infliximab on the development of coronary artery abnormalities in KD remain unclear. This study did not show reduction in the development of coronary artery abnormalities. However, regression in both the progression of coronary artery dilation/formation [44] and the resolution of dilated coronary arteries [45] following infliximab infusion have been reported. Therefore, infliximab may inhibit progression of coronary artery dilation and injury rather than prevent the formation of coronary artery abnormalities [46\u2022 ].",
