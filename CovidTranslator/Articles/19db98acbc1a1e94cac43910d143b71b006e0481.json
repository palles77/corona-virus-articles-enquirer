Severe symptoms include illness duration of more than 10 to 14 days, fever \u2265 102\u00b0 F, and purulent nasal discharge in an ill-appearing child. 1 The symptoms of an acute rhinosinusitis include nasal discharge, cough, fever, and halitosis. Nasal discharge can be clear or mucopurulent and does not correlate with the severity of disease. Cough is the most common complaint and is classically worse at night. The cough is described as persistent and may be dry or accompanied by copious nasal secretions. Fever is more indicative of a bacterial rhinosinusitis infection, especially when it lasts longer than 3 days and accompanies the rhinitis. 3 Children with maxillary sinusitis can present with pain to the upper posterior teeth. Rhinosinusitis can be differentiated from an upper respiratory tract infection (URI) by the worsening of symptoms",

This infl ammation can be due to infection, allergy, or anatomic obstruction. The obstruction of the sinus ostia, whether due to infection, allergy, or anatomic malformations ( Fig. 50-1) , is the common pathway leading to the symptoms and pathology of sinusitis. 1,2 The term rhinosinusitis is considered by many experts to be a more accurate term since the nasal mucosa is almost always involved in sinus infections. 3 Rhinosinusitis, based on the duration of symptoms, is further subdivided into acute rhinosinusitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, and recurrent rhinosinusitis. 1,2 It has been estimated that between 5% and 10% of children with an upper respiratory infection will go on to develop rhinosinusitis. 2, 4 The etiology of rhinosinusitis can be divided into the following categories: infectious and allergic. Among infectious etiologies, viral causes of rhinosinusitis include rhinovirus, infl uenza virus, and coronavirus. 3 Viral infections cause local infl ammation and blockage of the sinus ostia. Additionally, they can disrupt the ciliary function of the sinuses, leading to stasis and subsequent bacterial colonization. Cultures obtained from individuals presenting to an outpatient clinic with signs and symptoms consistent with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis revealed a number of organisms, as reported by the Respiratory Surveillance Program. 4 The most common bacterial organisms causing rhinosinusitis are listed in Table 50-1.
