Among both men and women, most deaths are due to noncommunicable conditions (Group II), and they account for about 6 out of 10 deaths globally. Communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions are responsible for just under one third of deaths in both males and females. The largest difference between the sexes occurs for Group III, with injuries accounting for almost 1 in 8 male deaths and 1 in 14 female deaths (Figure 3 ). Figure 4 shows the distribution of deaths at all ages for 12 major cause groups (groups responsible for at least 2% of all deaths, plus maternal conditions). This illustrates the relative importance of the respective causes of death and of male-female differences. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the world, particularly among women; such diseases caused almost 32% of all deaths in women and 27% in men in 2004. Infectious and parasitic diseases are the next leading cause, followed by cancers, but these groupings show much smaller overall sex differentials. The largest differences between men and women are observed for intentional injuries (twice as high among men) and unintentional injuries. Maternal conditions account for 1.9% of all female deaths. The respiratory infections are treated by the GBD as a separate cause group from infectious and parasitic diseases, and are to be distinguished from respiratory diseases, which refers to noncommunicable respiratory diseases (refer to Annex Table C3 ). This report uses 136 categories for disease and injury causes. The 20 most frequent causes of death are shown in Table 1 . Ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are the leading causes of death, followed by lower respiratory infections (including pneumonia), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diarrhoeal diseases. HIV/AIDS and TB are the sixth and seventh most common causes of death respectively, and together caused 3.5 million deaths in 2004. As may be expected from the very different distributions of deaths by age and sex, there are major differences in the ranking of causes between highand low-income countries ( Table 2 ). In low-income countries, the dominant causes are infectious and parasitic diseases (including malaria), and perinatal conditions. In the high-income countries, 9 out of the 10 leading causes of death are noncommunicable conditions, including four types of cancer. In the middle-income countries, the 10 leading causes of death are again dominated by noncommunicable conditions; they also include road traffic accidents as the sixth most common cause. a This category also includes other non-infectious causes arising in the perinatal period, apart from prematurity, low birth weight, birth trauma and asphyxia. These non-infectious causes are responsible for about 20% of deaths shown in this category. b Self-inflicted injuries resulting in death can also be referred to as suicides.",

YLL are calculated from the number of deaths at each age multiplied by a global standard life expectancy for the age at which death occurs. Taking into account the age at death causes major shifts in the proportion of deaths occurring in each of the WHO Regions (Figure 13 ). Based on the distribution of the world's 58.8 million deaths in 2004, the South-East Asia Region has the highest proportion of deaths (26%), followed by the African Region (19%), the Western Pacific Region (18%) and highincome countries (14%). Based on the YLL, however, the African Region accounts for 32% of all YLL, followed by South-East Asia (30%), the Western Pacific (13%) and the Eastern Mediterranean (9%) regions. Using the YLL increases the relative importance of Africa and South-East Asia in the global picture, because people from these regions die at a relatively young age. The relative importance of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Americas change little, and the remaining three regions decline in relative importance. Figure 14 presents similar data on the proportional distribution of deaths and YLL for the leading causes of death. Taking the age at death into account causes major shifts in the relative importance of the major causes. The two most common causes of death -ischaemic heart disease (12.2% of all deaths) and cerebrovascular conditions (9.7% of all deaths) -are responsible for only 5.8% and 4.2% of YLL, respectively. The main causes of YLL are perinatal conditions (prematurity and low birth weight, birth Ageing of populations in low-and middle-income countries will result in significantly increasing total deaths due to most noncommunicable diseases over the next 25 years. Global cancer deaths are projected to increase from 7. The projected 28% increase in global deaths due to injury between 2004 and 2030 is predominantly due to the increasing numbers of road traffic accident deaths, and increases in population numbers are projected to more than offset small declines in age-specific death rates for other causes of injury.

The term disability has a number of different meanings and, in particular, is not seen by some as a synonym or proxy for \"loss of health\". However, the GBD uses the term disability to refer to loss of health, where health is conceptualized in terms of functioning capacity in a set of health domains such as mobility, cognition, hearing and vision. The original GBD study established severity weights for approximately 500 disabling sequelae of diseases and injury, in a formal study involving health workers from all regions of the world. These weights were then grouped into seven classes, where class I has a weight between 0 and 0.02, and class VII a weight between 0.7 and 1 ( Table 8) . Participants in the study estimated distributions across the seven classes for each sequela.

Country groupings and regions used in this report are defined in Tables C1 and C2 (Annex C). GBD 2004 estimates are also available for other regional groupings on the WHO web site. a Table C3 (Annex C) lists the GBD cause categories and their definitions in terms of the International classification of diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10). The GBD cause categories are grouped into three broad cause groups: Group I (communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions), Group II (noncommunicable diseases) and Group III (injuries). General methods and data sources for the GBD estimates have been documented elsewhere (11) ; this part of the report documents the specific revisions for the 2004 estimates. Apart from the incorporation of new epidemiological data for specific causes, the GBD 2004 has incorporated:",

These cause-specific revisions and updates are outlined in Section B5. Total deaths by age and sex were estimated for each Member State by applying these death rates to the estimated 2004 de facto resident populations prepared by the United Nations Population Division in its 2006 revision (13) . Total deaths in the neonatal period (the first four weeks of life) for 2004 were estimated country by country using methods documented elsewhere in collaboration with the Department of Making Pregnancy Safer (26) . For China, recorded age-specific death rates for ages over five years from the 2000 census were adjusted for estimated underreporting of 11.3% for males and 18.1% for females (27) , projected forward to 2004 assuming an annual rate of mortality decline of 1.5%, based on the estimated rates of mortality for the two intercensal periods, 1982-1990 and 1990-2000.

For the GBD 2004 estimates, in the same group of 72 countries, there are now 55 countries reporting data to the third or fourth character of ICD-10. This increase of 20 countries reporting data at the detailed level of ICD-10 enhances the comparability of the 2004 estimates.

In some instances the age of death is not always taken into account. Some conditions, such as septicaemia and pneumonia, have specific codes within P00-P96 which should be used for neonates (0-27 days). For countries with vital registration data, we have recoded all the deaths aged 0-27 days from natural causes that were initially coded outside the 'P chapter' to codes in the 'P chapter' whenever possible. In a number of countries, neonatal septicaemia (P36) is frequently assigned to A40 and A41 (septicaemia).

As all the African INDEPTH sites were rural, the INDEPTH data were taken as representative of rural populations. The Group II fraction of deaths in the African INDEPTH data flattened out above age 50 years, and was lower than in all other African data sources. We thus used an average of INDEPTH and South African data for rural provinces, giving less weight to the INDEPTH data with increasing age for rural populations. For countries in the D mortality stratum, 44% of the population were assumed to be urban, and 29% for the E mortality stratum.

Prevalence of long-term disability GBD 2004 updates were used to estimate the prevalence of people with long-term disability by age, sex and region for two severity thresholds of disability. The GBD links loss of full health to disease and injury causes through the concepts of cases and sequelae. For incident cases of a given disease or injury in the population, there will be a distribution of current and future health states (conceptualized in terms of functioning capacity in a set of health domains) in the population, aggregated across individuals. The term disability was used in the naming of the DALY to stress the vision of health that goes beyond the absence of disease and the emphasis on difficulties in functioning. Although the term disability has a number of different meanings and connotations and is not seen by some as a synonym or proxy for \"loss of health\", the GBD uses \"disability\" to refer to a subconstruct of \"diminution of health\", where health is conceptualized in terms of functioning capacity in a set of health domains.",

In future revisions of the GBD study, increased effort will be devoted to the estimation of the prevalences of impairments and disabilities directly, and to ensuring consistency with the disease-and injury-specific sequelae estimates.

Projected trends in global mortality: 2004-2030 WHO has previously published projections of mortality from 2002 to 2030 based on the GBD 2002 estimates and using projection methods similar to those used in the original GBD 1990 study (18, 19). These projections have been updated (Figure 15) using the GBD 2004 estimates as a starting-point, together with updated projections of HIV deaths prepared by UNAIDS and WHO (20), and updated forecasts of economic growth by region published by the World Bank (21) (see Annex B7 for further information). Large declines in mortality between 2004 and 2030 are projected for all of the principal communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional causes, including HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. Global HIV/ AIDS deaths are projected to rise from 2.2 million in 2008 to a maximum of 2.4 million in 2012, and then to decline to 1.2 million in 2030, under a baseline scenario that assumes that coverage with antiretroviral drugs continues to rise at current rates.",

CodMod was used to adjust for changes in mortality rates and income levels from 2002 to 2004. For the within-group cause-specific estimates, we used specific proportionate mortality distributions from the VR 2005 data weighted as follows: 40% urban and 60% rural. Supplementary information from WHO technical programmes and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/ AIDS (UNAIDS) was also used in estimating specific causes of death. India For the GBD 2002 estimates for India, cause patterns of mortality were based on the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death Database (MCCD) for urban India (1996), the Annual Survey of Causes of Death (SCD) for rural areas of India for 1996-1998 (11) and information from WHO technical programmes and UNAIDS. Verbal autopsy methods used in the sample registration system for assigning cause of death have been substantially revised as part of the Million Deaths Study (37). Preliminary data for a nationally representative sample of 62 553 deaths in 2001-2003 were assessed for use in the GBD 2004. However, as validation studies and analysis of the verbal autopsy-assigned cause-of-death information were not yet completed, these data were not used for the GBD 2004 revision. Instead, the GBD 2002 cause distributions for India were adjusted to the 2004 all-cause envelope, and the resulting cause-specific estimates were further adjusted with information for 2004 from WHO technical programmes and UNAIDS on maternal, perinatal and childhood cluster conditions, as well as epidemiological estimates for TB, HIV, illicit drug dependence and problem use, rheumatoid arthritis and war deaths (see below). It should be noted that WHO and UNAIDS have substantially reduced estimates of HIV deaths for India compared to previous estimates used for the GBD 2002. The Islamic Republic of Iran The latest death registration data available for the Islamic Republic of Iran were for the period 21 March 2004 to 20 March 2005, as per the Iranian calendar. The registration system operated by the Deputy of Health Programme (Ministry of Health and Medical Education) captured deaths from 29 out of 30 provinces, with an estimated coverage of around 65% of all deaths occurring in the country.",

These incidence estimates were adjusted as follows. First, case reports data from national health information systems were updated to 2004. Second, the risk-based estimates were compared to national case reports and adjusted downwards where necessary to be consistent with a minimum reporting completeness of 2% rather than the 1% used in the Roll Back Malaria estimates. This reduced estimated cases for certain large countries in South-East Asia to levels more consistent with country studies and advice. Third, for other countries outside Africa with reporting completeness greater than 2%, incidence estimates were reduced by 10% to account for reductions in endemicity levels associated with increased urbanisation (65) . Fourth, incidence and mortality estimates for 2004 were compared country by country with estimates for 2006 prepared for the Global Malaria Report 2008, and adjusted for countries where improved 2006 estimates were available based on an analysis of health facility and survey data (66) . Finally, implied case fatality rates were calculated using the mortality estimates (described below) and for a few countries where case fatality rates were zero or very high, adjustments made to mortality or incidence estimates -these were mostly countries with low levels of malaria. Global and regional estimates of the total number of malaria cases in 2004 are shown in Table B5 .Revised mortality estimates for children aged under five years in sub-Saharan Africa were based on the analysis by Rowe et al. (67) . Cause fractions for malaria and other major child causes of death were adjusted to fit postneonatal child death envelopes for 2004 country-by country as described in Section B2. Countries with larger numbers of malaria deaths tended to be those where cause-specific fractions required greater adjustment, so the input estimates for malaria deaths (804 600 for sub-Saharan Africa) were adjusted to 724 400. This is quite similar to the implied figure of 744 000 estimated by Breman et al. in the Disease Control Priorities project (68) . For countries outside sub-Saharan Africa, child mortality due to malaria was based on either recent death registration data, or on the GBD 2002 estimates adjusted for consistency with postneonatal child death envelopes and for plausibility of implied case fatality rates.The GBD 2002 applied an assumption that 90% of malaria deaths were children aged under five years in all regions of the world, based on some information",

            "text": "The GBD 1990 estimated 1.5 million DALYs and 8000 deaths due to schistosoma infections. Schistosomiasis cases were treated as a single sequela, with an average disability weight of 0.006 (74) . The GBD 2002 used the same disease model with updated prevalence estimates to estimate that 1.7 million DALYs and 15 371 deaths were due to schistosomiasis in 2002.There are five different types of schistosoma species: Schistosoma haematobium (the most prevalent and widespread species in Africa and the Middle East), S. mansoni (found in Africa and the only species seen in Latin America), S. japonicum (restricted to the Pacific region including China and the Philippines), S. mekongi (found in limited areas of the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Cambodia) and S. intercalatum (found in 10 countries in the rainforest belt of Africa). For the 2004 revision, the incidence and prevalence of cases of infection were separately estimated by country for S. mansoni, S. haematobium and S. japonicum plus S. mekongi. Severe renal damage (S. haematobium) and severe liver damage (other forms) were also modelled, assuming the incidence of these sequelae was the same as the estimated numbers of deaths, and the disability weights were the same as those for end-stage renal disease. Cancer outcomes were not included as sequelae for schistosomiasis, but are included with overall cancer burden estimates. A separate calculation would be required to estimate attributable cancer burden for schistosomiasis.Estimates of prevalence for infection with S. mansoni and S. haematobium in African countries were based on information provided by the WHO programme for Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases for [2003] [2004] . For countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region, the previous 2002 prevalence estimates were used. For the 2004 revision, incidence rates were estimated assuming zero remission rates (except for a period in early adulthood when prevalence rates decline). The estimated durations are much longer than the one year assumed in the GBD 2002 and GBD 1990, and as a result of time discounting, the YLD estimated for the 2004 revision (0.88 million globally) are lower than those published for 2002 (1.5 million).The GBD 2002 estimated that schistosomiasis was responsible for around 15 000 deaths globally (excluding attributable cancer deaths), although others have argued that the figure should be much higher (75) . Van der Werf et al. (76) , using limited data from Africa, estimated that schistosomiasis caused 210 000 deaths annually. A literature review found limited data from studies with small sample sizes, limiting ability to extrapolate to population level. In the absence of usable studies, a back-calculation method was employed to estimate approximate case fatality rates for two populations with significant numbers of schistosomiasis deaths recorded in death registration data.Egyptian death registration data for 2000 gave an estimate of 3303 schistosomiasis deaths in 2000 after adjustment for incompleteness of reporting. Reported deaths did not distinguish between S. mansoni and S. haematobium. Estimates of population prevalence for the 1980s and 1990s vary widely (20-40%); see for example Mansour et al. (77) . Assuming a prevalence rate of 30% in the 1980s, this gives an approximate case fatality rate of around 0.03%. This method was also applied to Brazil, where only S. mansoni is endemic. An analysis of Brazilian death registration data for 1990 to 1995 found that annual numbers of deaths due to schistosomiasis averaged around 570. Based on a conservative estimate of infection prevalence of around 8 million in 1980 (78) , this gives a case fatality rate of around 0.007%.These estimates are generally consistent with those reported in the literature, and also with the known lower fatality rates for S. mansoni compared with S. haematobium. For the GBD 2004 update, annual case fatality rates for prevalent cases were conservatively assumed to be 0.01% for S. mansoni, 0.02% for S. haematobium, and 0.03% for S. japonicum and S. mekongi. Applying these case fatality rates to the revised prevalence estimates gave a revised global estimate for deaths due to schistosomiasis (excluding cancers caused by schistosomiasis) of 41 000 for 2004. The sex ratio of schistosomiasis deaths was assumed to be similar to the 1990 estimates (62.5% male in the African and Eastern Mediterranean regions, 66% in the Americas and Asia, and 80% male in China).The Global Burden of Disease: 2004 Update provides a comprehensive assessment of the health of the world's population in 2004. Consistent and comparative description of the burden of diseases and injuries is an important input to health decision-making and planning processes. The Global Burden of Disease provides a framework for integrating the available information on mortality and health in populations to assess the comparative importance of diseases and injuries in causing premature death, loss of health and disability in all regions of the world.This report draws on the extensive databases of the World Health Organization and information provided by Member States to provide detailed estimates of premature mortality, disability and loss of health for 135 causes by age and sex for the world, for regions of the world, and for countries grouped by average income per capita. It builds on previous assessments for the years This report is part of ongoing efforts by WHO to monitor and analyse the global health situation and trends and to foster increased comparability of data between countries. The report builds upon the work of technical programmes within WHO at country, regional and global levels, and collaboration with partners, including UN agencies, the private sector and academic institutions.",
