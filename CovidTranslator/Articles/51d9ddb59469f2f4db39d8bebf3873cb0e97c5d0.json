            "text": "Knowledge of immunodominant regions in major viral antigens is important for rational design of effective vaccines and diagnostic tests. Although there have been many reports of such work done for SARS-CoV, these were mainly focused on the immune responses of humans and mice. In this study, we aim to search for and compare immunodominant regions of the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins which are recognized by sera from different animal species, including mouse, rat, rabbit, civet, pig and horse. Twelve overlapping recombinant protein fragments were produced in Escherichia coli, six each for the S and N proteins, which covered the entire coding region of the two proteins. Using a membrane-strip based Western blot approach, the reactivity of each antigen fragment against a panel of animal sera was determined. Immunodominant regions containing linear epitopes, which reacted with sera from all the species tested, were identified for both proteins. The S3 fragment (aa 402-622) and the N4 fragment (aa 220-336) were the most immunodominant among the six S and N fragments, respectively. Antibodies raised against the S3 fragment were able to block the binding of a panel of S-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to SARS-CoV in ELISA, further demonstrating the immunodominance of this region. Based on these findings, one-step competition ELISAs were established which were able to detect SARS-CoV antibodies from human and at least seven different animal species. Considering that a large number of animal species are known to be susceptible to SARS-CoV, these assays will be a useful tool to trace the origin and transmission of SARS-CoV and to minimise the risk of animal-to-human transmission.",

The aetiological agent was a previously unknown coronavirus, now named SARS associated coronavirus or SARS-CoV, which seems to be evolutionally distant to any of the existing coronaviruses known at the time (Rota et al., 2003; Marra et al., 2003) . Initial epidemiology studies indicated an animal origin , which was further confirmed by the detection and isolation of almost identical viruses from wild life animals in live animal markets (Guan et al., 2003) . More recently, SARS-like-CoVs were identified among different species of horseshoe bats Lau et al., 2005) , implicating bats as the potential reservoir of these novel coronaviruses .",

Receptor-binding and membrane fusion between the virus and host cell is mediated by the S protein, which is also the main target for neutralizing antibodies (Lai et al., 2007) . The S protein is a large class I transmembrane glycoprotein consisting of two domains: the S1 domain at the N terminus responsible for receptorbinding and the C-terminal S2 domain functioning in fusion. For SARS-CoV, the minimal receptor-binding domain has been defined as a 193-aa fragment (aa 318-510) which binds to the receptor molecule, ACE2, in vitro Wong et al., 2004) . The N protein is thought to participate in the replication and transcription of viral RNA and interfere with cell cycle processes of host cells. In addition, the N protein of many coronaviruses is highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed during infection, making it an attractive target for detection of virus-specific antibodies (Lai et al., 2007) .",

By conjugating the detection antibodies with horseradish peroxidase, we developed one-step-competition ELISAs (or oscELISA) which are simple to use and can detect SARS-specific antibodies from different species. With further improvement and validation, we are hopeful that this will become a powerful tool for early detection of SARS-CoV infections in animals, which will in turn help to reduce the risk of future SARS outbreaks in humans.",

First, there are more than a dozen animal species known to be susceptible to SARS-CoV by either natural or experimental infection , and it is likely that more animal species could be susceptible too. It is important to differentiate between those which play a key role in the origin and transmission of SARS-CoV and those that are infected, but play no significant role in disease spread and spill over to the human population. Secondly, there is a lack of an ideal detection approach to monitor infection status of different animal species. The most commonly used tool is direct PCR analysis for the presence of viral material in animal specimens (Guan et al., 2003; Poon et al., 2005; Kan et al., 2005; Woo et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2006) .

Secondly, if the animals were susceptible, this would provide us better quality reagent than that obtained from immunization with inactivated virus and adjuvant.

For the N protein, it seems that the C-terminal region is more immunogenic than the Nterminal region. For the S protein, the location of S3 (aa 402-622) is consistent with previous studies conducted with SARS patient sera, which revealed that the immunodominant regions are located in the following regions of the S protein, aa 528-635 , 540-559 and 441-700 .

Collection and purification of IgY antibodies from egg yolk have proven to be a very effective and economical way of producing large quantities of antibodies (Tachedjian et al., 2006) . By collecting the lymphocytes (bursa or spleen) of antigensensitized chickens, the immune gene repertoire can be stored for later production of recombinant chicken single chain antibodies, which is technically less challenging than the production of rabbit or mouse single chain antibodies (Foord et al., 2007) . The successful production of S3-and Nc-specific antibodies was confirmed by several assays, including IFAT, ELISA and Western blot. The results presented in Fig.  2 demonstrated not only the specific staining of viral antigens in SARS-CoV infected cells, but also the different staining patterns for the two antibodies.

However, for viruses like SARS-CoV, which are known to have many variants and are rapidly mutating, a mAb-based cELISA may potentially give false negative diagnosis due to subtle changes of protein sequence close to or in the epitope region. For this reason, we have developed in parallel cELISAs using mono-specific antibodies as detecting antibodies.

It is also important to note that depending on the purpose of application, one may wish to use different assays under different circumstances. Although sequence analysis would suggest low probability of interference by cross-reactive antibodies to other animal coronaviruses, this is yet to be confirmed experimentally for the HRP-IgY/NC oscELISA. However, we are certain that this will not be an issue in the Sprotein-based cELISAs. This was deduced from the preliminary data obtained with bat SL-CoV antisera in this study. It was clear that not all bat SL-CoV sera were detectable in the HRP-IgY/S3 oscELISA. The failure to detect some positive bat sera using the HRP-IgY/S3 oscELISA can be explained by the significant sequence difference present in the N-terminal half of the S proteins of SARS-CoVs and SARS-like-CoVs . The development of three cELISAs was intended to provide choices for different applications. If the most specific antibody test is needed to detect SARS-CoV infection, the mAb-based cELISA may be the best choice. On the other hand, if one wishes to detect antibodies to all of the related SARS-CoVs and SARSlike-CoVs, the anti-Nc-based cELISA will be more appropriate. The anti-S3-based cELISA will be most useful to detect antibodies for SARS-CoVs only, but allow for sequence variations in the S proteins of different SARS-CoV strains.",
