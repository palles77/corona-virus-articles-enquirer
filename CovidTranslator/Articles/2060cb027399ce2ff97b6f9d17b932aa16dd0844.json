However, definitive criteria for treatment decisions have not yet been established. We investigate a potentially useful relatively non-invasive biomarker, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), to predict favorable responses to budesonide or montelukast, common treatment for children with asthma. Methods: Young children (1 to 6 years old) were enrolled in this randomized, parallel, 2-group, open-label trial. Criteria for eligibility included: 1) being symptomatic during the run-in period; and 2) having a serum EDN (sEDN) level \u2265 53 ng/mL, with positive specific immunoglobulin E to house dust mite. Eligible patients were randomly placed into 2 groups: the BIS group received budesonide inhalation suspension (BIS) 0.5 mg once daily; the MONT group received montelukast 4 mg once daily. Ineligible patients were invited to receive montelukast 4 mg once daily (OBS group). Treatment period was 12 weeks. Results: Asthma control days increased significantly in the BIS and MONT groups (P < 0.000) over the 12-week study period. There was no significant change in sEDN in the BIS group but there was a significant decrease in the MONT group (P < 0.000). Patients in the OBS group with high EDN levels (> 53 ng/mL) showed a significant decrease due to MONT treatment (P = 0.023). Rescue medication usage significantly decreased in the BIS and MONT groups (P < 0.000). Conclusions: EDN is a useful relatively non-invasive biomarker for predicting responses to montelukast and budesonide treatment of preschool children with beta2-agonist responsive recurrent wheeze and multiple-trigger wheeze (Trial registry at UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, UMIN000008335).",

            "text": "Chronic airway inflammation is a hallmark of asthma 1 ; consequently, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are the main treatment. 2 Although leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) also have anti-inflammatory properties 3 and are often administered, especially to young children, guidelines clearly state ICSs are the preferred option for long-term control of asthma. 2 This preference is based mainly on evidence from clinical trials comparing mean responses between treatment and control groups. However, other trials have demonstrated that there is considerable inter-individual variability in treatment response to ICSs versus LTRAs. [4] [5] [6] It is important for a clinician to collect information that better guides them in selecting medication most likely to achieve a favorable response in each patient (i.e., tailor-made treatment regimens).",

The recognition of a high EDN/ HDM-sensitive phenotype that exhibits a favorable response to standard asthma treatments is important. Of the 100 patients screened for eligibility, nearly half (43%) were found to be of this phenotype, which is considerable. The elevated levels of EDN and other eosinophil degranulation products found in symptomatic asthma would suggest airway inflammation is characterized not only by an increase in the number of eosinophils, but also an increase in airway eosinophil degranulation. 16 Therefore, it has been suggested that the secretory activity of eosinophils -a combination of concentration of eosinophils and their propensity to release degranulation products -may be a key marker for disease activity and is more accurately assessed by eosinophil degranulation products such as EDN. 17 EDN is released almost exclusively by eosinophils 18 ; therefore, any change in EDN levels would be a direct reflection of changes in eosinophilic inflammation. Significant changes in EDN levels between disease phases have been noted in previous studies. 12, 19 EDN may therefore be useful in predicting therapeutic outcomes and is a welcome addition to a clinician's ability to effectively treat and monitor asthma. This was further demonstrated in our study as montelukast treatment significantly reduced elevated EDN levels in the MONT group, which has also been shown in other asthma studies 12 and even in patients with post-RSV bronchiolitis recurrent wheeze. 20 Among the subjects excluded from the main study group (OBS group), the subgroup with no HDM sensitivity but elevated EDN experienced a reduction in their EDN levels as well.",

            "text": "In previous asthma 12 and AD 23 studies, sEDN levels have correlated well with symptom scores. It is known that eosinophils release EDN and other degranulation products when activated; in particular, peripheral blood eosinophils were found to release approximately 17%-28% of their total intracellular EDN. 24 Furthermore, Sedgwick et al. 24 demonstrated that intracellular EDN is also increased in asthmatic patients, while ECP is not. Montelukast is an LTRA, capable of binding with cysteine leukotriene (cysLT) receptors expressed on eosinophils and disrupting their autocrine release. CysLTs can induce eosinophil degranulation, 25 which then leads to release of a number of mediators including EDN, ECP and cysLTs. 26 This may explain the reduction in EDN levels in the MONT group and in patients in the OBS group with high EDN levels. Corticosteroid treatment may or may not eliminate cytokine-primed, EDNincreased and longer-surviving eosinophils resulting in decreased EDN levels. 12 We observed no significant decrease in EDN levels after budesonide treatment in our study, which was contrary to our initial hypothesis that budesonide would also reduce EDN levels. This may be because budesonide, an ICS, acts locally, whereas montelukast acts systemically. Eosinophils develop principally in the bone marrow and are recruited from the circulation, where they migrate to inflammatory sites, such as the airways, and then participate in immunologic processes. 26 Once activated, the eosinophil releases EDN and other granular proteins. Changes in granular protein levels signal changes in the turnover and activity of the eosinophil. Taken together, eosinophil production, recruitment and activation are a systemic process.",
