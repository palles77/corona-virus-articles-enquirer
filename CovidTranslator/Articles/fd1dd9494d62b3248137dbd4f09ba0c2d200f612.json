Our previous studies have demonstrated that TGEV infection induces the activation of p53 signaling pathway. In this study we investigated the effects of TGEV infection on the cell cycle of host cells and the roles of p53 activation in this process. The results showed that TGEV infection induced cell cycle arrest at S and G2/M phases in both asynchronous and synchronized PK-15 and ST cells, while UV-inactivated TGEV lost the ability of induction of cell cycle arrest. TGEV infection promoted p21 accumulation, down-regulated cell cycle-regulatory proteins cyclins B1, cdc2, cdk2 and PCNA. Further studies showed that inhibition of p53 signaling could attenuate the TGEV-induced S-and G2/M-phase arrest by reversing the expression of p21 and corresponding cyclin/cdk. In addition, TGEV infection of the cells synchronized in various stages of cell cycle showed that viral genomic RNA and subgenomic RNA, and virus titer were higher in the cells released from S-phase-or G2/M phase-synchronized cells than that in the cells released from the G0/G1 phase-synchronized or asynchronous cells after 18 h p.i. Taken together, our data suggested that TGEV infection induced S and G2/M phase arrest in host cells, which might provide a favorable condition for viral replication.",

A variety of RNA viruses have been shown to induce G0/G1, S or G2/M arrest in infected cells. For example, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected T lymphocytes isolated from patients are arrested in G2/M (Zimmerman et al., 2006) ; Influenza A virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1) infection results in G0/G1-phase accumulation of infected cells, which increase viral protein expression and progeny virus production (He et al., 2010) ; Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS2 protein induces cell cycle arrest in the S-phase in mammalian cells to facilitate HCV viral replication (Yang et al., 2006) . In term of coronaviruses, murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) has been shown to induce G0/G1 arrest (Chen and Makino, 2004) ; SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein can disrupt cytokinesis and block S-phase progression in mammalian cells (Surjit et al., 2006) ; Bronchitis virus (IBV) infection can induce G2/M phase arrest to facilitate viral replication (Dove et al., 2006) . Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection has been shown to alter some cell signaling pathways implicated in cell cycle regulation in our previous study (Huang et al., 2013) . However, the effects of TGEV infection on the cell cycle of host cells and the significance of cell cycle regulation in TGEV replication need to be further investigated.",

CyclinD-cdk2 complex and cyclinE-cdk4 complex regulate cell cycle progression in the G0/G1 phase. CyclinA-cdk2 complex regulates cell cycle progression in the S phase. CyclinB-cdc2 complex is a crucial regulator for progression through late G2 and early M (Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009 ). These cell-cycle regulatory molecules have been shown to be regulated by some upstream pathways like p53 signaling. p53 signaling can control the expression of p21, which directly bind to some cdk-cyclin complexes to inhibit their kinases activity (He et al., 2005) . Our previous studies have demonstrated that TGEV infection induced the activation of p53 signaling pathway to regulate cell growth and apoptosis (Huang et al., 2013) . In this study, we further investigated the effects of TGEV infection on the cell cycle of host cells, the roles of p53 signaling activation in regulation of cell cycle progression in TGEV-infected cells, and the significance of cell cycle regulation in TGEV replication. Results showed that that TGEV infection could perturb the progression of cell cycle and facilitate virus gene replication.",

Consequently, the level of p21 increased in TGEV infected PK-15 and ST cells from 8 h p.i., and significantly increased at 12 h p.i., while proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a mediator involved in p21-regulated DNA replication within S phase, decreased accordingly in TGEV-infected PK-15 and ST cells (Fig. 6A) .

The G2/M transition in the cell cycle is positively controlled by complex of cdc2 (CDK1) and cyclin B. Members of the CDKI family of proteins (CDK inhibitors) bind to the CDK/cyclin complexes and inhibit the kinase activity, to regulate the G2/M-phase transition (King and Cidlowski, 1998) . Cyclin A-CDK2 complex is the main cyclin-CDK complex in the S phase, and the activity of the complex is required for S phase transition and control of DNA replication (Elledge, 1996) .

As a DNA damage response protein, p53 transcriptionally activates numerous genes involved in DNA repair and cell cycle arrest (Vogelstein et al., 2000) , and p53dependent arrest of cells at G1/S or G2/M phase is an important component of the cellular response to genotoxic stress including virus infection (Casavant et al., 2006; De Bolle et al., 2004) . The first transcriptional target of p53 was p21, a CKI of the Cip/Kip family, which bridges the function of p53 with the cell cycle and plays important roles in regulation of cell cycle progression or arrest (He et al., 2005) . The p21 is recognized to be an important mediator to delay transit from G1 to S phase and/or from G2 to M phase, thus preventing the effects of DNA damage on gene functions (Abbas and Dutta, 2009). p21 has also been shown to regulate DNA replication within the S phase in vitro, by binding to proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)/cdk complexes and by dissociating cyclin A/cdk2/p107/E2F transitional complexes (Abbas and Dutta, 2009) . In this study, we showed that TGEV infection induced p53 and p21 accumulation and PCNA decrease. Furthermore, PFT-\u2423, a specific inhibitor of p53, prevented the arrest of the cell cycle in TGEVinfected cells. The observation that TGEV infection induced cell cycle arrest at S and G2/M phases in both PK-15 and ST cells virtually required the possible involvement of p53 in these processes. This observation is not consistent with the findings in other coronavirus-infectious bronchitis virus, which induced cell cycle arrest at both S and G2/M phases independent of p53 (Li et al., 2007) , suggesting that p53 might play different roles in viruses-infected cells.",

            "text": "Some viruses can regulate the cell cycle progression through interaction between virus and host cells in order to induce the cell cycle arrest and provide an advantageous environment for viral replication (Dove et al., 2006; Li et al., 2007) . Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) could increase protein accumulation and progeny virus production in cells enriched in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (Li et al., 2007) . Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection also increased the transduction of HIV in the G2/M phase compared to other stages of the cell cycle (Groschel and Bushman, 2005) . Many substrates (i.e., nucleotides) in S phase are abundantly available for viral replication (Yang et al., 2006) . Furthermore, there is evidence that one consequence of G2/M arrest is to establish a pseudo-S phase state for viruses to replicate of their genomes (Belyavskyi et al., 1998) . To specifically investigate whether a particular stage of the cell cycle favored TGEV replication, we synchronized cells in various stages of the cell cycle and compared efficiencies of virus infection. Results showed that TGEV replication levels, sgRNA synthesis were greater in the cells released from G1/S phase or G2/M phase of the cell cycle after 18 h p.i., when compared to either cells released from the G0/G1 phase or asynchronous cells. Our results also provided evidences that TGEV titer in the cells released from G1/S phase or G2/M phase synchronized cells was higher than that in cells released from G0/G1 phase synchronized cells. This might be that cells synchronized at G0/G1 phase need longer time to reenter cell cycle progression than synchronized cells at the G1/S phase, which support the hypothesis that S phase state was beneficial for virus replication. Therefore, we favor the hypothesis that TGEV induces S and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in order to provide a more favorable condition for virus production.",
