We conducted a case-control study of 72 hospital workers with SARS and 144 matched controls. Inconsistent use of goggles, gowns, gloves, and caps was associated with a higher risk for SARS infection (unadjusted odds ratio 2.42 to 20.54, p < 0.05). The likelihood of SARS infection was strongly associated with the amount of personal protection equipment perceived to be inadequate, having <2 hours of infection control training, and not understanding infection control procedures. No significant differences existed between the case and control groups in the proportion of workers who performed high-risk procedures, reported minor protection equipment problems, or had social contact with SARS-infected persons. Perceived inadequacy of personal protection equipment supply, infection control training <2 hours, and inconsistent use of personal protection equipment when in contact with SARS patients were significant independent risk factors for SARS infection.",

Suspected SARS cases are those that do not completely fulfill the above definition but were considered to be likely cases of SARS on the basis of clinical judgment. If no known history of exposure exists, patients are considered for exclusion if an alternative diagnosis can fully explain the clinical symptoms. Laboratory confirmation of SARS infection was also conducted by one or more of the following assays: reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); culture from throat wash, urine, stool and nasal swab specimens taken at days 1, 3, and 5; or paired serologic assay from clotted blood taken at day 1 and 21.",

As all staff was required to use protective masks from March 12, 2003, these hospital workers were presumed to have contracted the virus as a result of breakthrough transmission. An infection control nurse explained the purpose and logistics of the study to the study participants, obtained their verbal consent for participation, presented them with a structured questionnaire, and collected the completed questionnaire. SARS case-patients were asked to nominate as controls two colleagues who had been working in the same job position, in the same ward, and in proximity with the case-patient before he became ill. Medical and nursing staff (48 of 72 cases) self-administered the questionnaires while other staff (e.g., healthcare assistants and ward assistants) were interviewed by an infection control nurse. Out of the 72 cases, 57 nominated 114 controls who completed the questionnaire (114/144 = 79.2%); 15 cases did not nominate a control and hence 30 controls were randomly selected from the duty roster of the day before the case felt unwell, matching for job position (30/144 = 20.8%). Questionnaires were collected from 57 (79.2%) nominated controls. Nominated controls who did not return the questionnaire were replaced by controls randomly selected from the duty roster of the day before the case felt unwell, matching for job position (15/72 = 20.8%). Of the 144 controls completing the questionnaire, one was invalidated because she later became a suspected case. Controls showed neither influenzalike symptoms nor SARS-related symptoms during the study and had not been identified as a suspected SARS case as of August 15, 2003. No blood test was conducted to determine whether these persons were asymptomatic SARS cases. Another study that tested 674 healthcare workers who were working in the same hospital cluster found no asymptomatic or subclinical SARS. It can thereby be assumed that the control group had not contracted the virus (5).",

Nevertheless, policy makers should be made aware that the supply of different types of personal protection equipment had often been seen as inadequate, and it is one of the very significant risk factors identified. The perception of inadequate supply was not verified by this study. These perceptions may reflect the actual situation or may be an inaccurate impression of the hospital workers. Caution is advised in interpreting these results. Nevertheless, at the time of the study, the media had reported frequent complaints about personal protection equipment supply shortages from hospital workers. The perception of inadequate personal protection equipment is likely to be associated with the personal protection equipment supply situation.

            "text": "The seven problems are: 1) inconsistent use of at least 1 type of personal protection equipment when having contact with SARS patients, 2) with \"patients in general,\" 3) when there was \"no patient contact,\" 4) when SARS infection control training was less than 2 hours, 5) when the respondent reported not understanding SARS infection control procedures, 6) when at least one personal protection equipment was perceived to be in inadequate supply in the 3 settings, and 7) when hand hygiene was inconsistent when there was \"no patient contact.\" c Percentages of the number of problems encountered in the control group: 3 problems (6.7%), 4 problems (4.5%), 5 (1.5%), 6 (0.7%), and 7 (0%). d Percentages of the number of problems encountered in the case group: 3 problems (10.1%), 4 (8.7%), 5 (13.0%), 6 (8.7%), and 7 (2.9%).shortages were at least partially responsible for many of the SARS infections. As inadequate knowledge of SARS infection control (\"did not understand procedures\") is also a strong risk factor for breakthrough transmission, SARS infection control training must not be overlooked. Indepth, thorough training (>2 hrs) is required. Soon after the initial SARS outbreak, it was mandatory for all hospital workers to attend at least one 1-hour structured training session delivered by the infection control team, and the records of these sessions were collected and submitted to the Hospital Authority. These training sessions were conducted twice per day for the initial week from the middle of March and daily until the end of June. The content of these training sessions included basic knowledge of SARS and its clinical presentation, route of transmission, types and proper use of different personal protective equipment for different risk levels, the procedures for handling high risk specimens, environmental disinfection protocols, and commonly observed problems. The content of the training was regularly revised with updated information. Regular updates and attendance of the training sessions were strongly recommended. The unit supervisors were given more intensive training to train their staff. The findings of this study underscore the importance of in-depth training in SARS prevention among hospital workers.The findings eliminate a number of speculated risk factors which include the following: performing particular high-risk procedures on SARS patients, having social contacts with people who were later found to have SARS cases, and experiencing various minor problems in using the mask. Performing high-risk procedures was not a significant factor, hence, it is speculated that this is due to a high degree of awareness and caution taken when performing these procedures with SARS patients.It is found that those who encountered any of the seven identified problems had a greatly increased likelihood of contracting SARS. The number of problems encountered is a strong predictor of SARS infection. It is recommended that, after each day's work, health workers complete a checklist to be reviewed by management. No hospital staff should be exposed to SARS before receiving adequate training or before they have obtained a thorough understanding of the infection control procedures. The results of the multivariate analysis show that infection control training, personal protection equipment use, and perceived supply were independently associated with SARS infection risk among hospital workers.This study has a number of limitations. As a casecontrol study, it is subject to recall bias. However, the recall period was usually within 1 week as all the case-patients were interviewed while they were hospitalized. Hand hygiene data were self-reported and not audited. Nevertheless, since respondents were required to report the frequency of hand washing from a categorical response format rather than an open ended question, the responses should be reasonably reliable. Another possible bias may be the case group's attributing their infection to external factors (e.g., inadequate supplies) and the control group's doing the opposite. Given that the odds ratios obtained were strongly significant and consistent with one another, it is unlikely that this form of bias could account for all of the observed differences. The study, however, has a relatively large sample size, a high response rate, and has controlled for the exposure to other background confounding factors.",
