In Turkey there has been an increase in the number of cases during years since 2002. Humans of all ages living in endemic areas,especially those who are working as shepherds and toddlers, have high risk of acquiring CCHF. Objectives: The epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of the children, who were diagnosed as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) were described. Study design: The children infected with CCHF virus between April 2008 and October 2009, and hospitalised in Ankara D\u0131\u015f kap\u0131 Children's and Research Hospital were included. Results: Laboratory diagnosis was set by detection of CCHF IgM antibodies and/or genetic detection of CCHF virus. Thirtyone cases included to the study, and all were from the northeastern Anatolia and the southern parts of Black sea region. The mean age was 9.45 \u00b1 4.9 years, the proportion of females was 38.7%. The majority (87%) of the cases had the history of tick bite. There was no fatal case. All the patients had the history of fever. Malaise,tonsillopharyngitis, nausea-vomiting, headache, diarrhea, myalgia and rash were the most common symptoms. The mean AST and ALT levels on the admission were 116 (range 25-389) and 61 (range 8-180) U/L respectively. The mean platelet count on admission was 125,000/mm 3 , and the lowest was 23,000/mm 3 . The mean of the lowest white blood cell count was 2353/mm 3 and the mean of the highest lactate dehydrogenase was 861 IU/L. Conclusions: The clinical course of CCHF among children seems to be milder than in adults. Tonsillopharyngitis is a common symptom among children with CCHF.",

The case fatality rate reported from Ministry of Health of Turkey was 5%. 11, 12 We reported no fatal case among 31 patients, who are under the age of 16. Our data suggest that the disease course is milder among children age group. According to the data held by Ministry of Health of Turkey, there were CCHF confirmed totally 242 cases under eighteen years old in Turkey and 4 deaths were reported in 2008 and 2009 in this age group (CFR: 1.65). Our observations among children age group is contradictory with the findings of a study reported by Mardani et al. from Iran. 13 In that study the case fatality rate among 34 children was reported as high as 26.5% (9 of 34). In another study from Turkey including 21 children with CCHF, only one fatal case was reported with the fatality rate 4.7%. 14 This fatal case was reported to have severe disease on initial admission, symptoms for the last 2 weeks and multi-system organ failure. He required ventilatory support for pulmonary haemorrhage but did not improve and died during his 3rd week in hospital. The CFR in CCHF infection could be different among different patient populations, because of several reasons. The virulences of different strains, access to the health system, the sensitivity threshold for the symptoms, co-existence of infections, and the last but not the least the host factors could contribute to the different outcomes among the different patient groups. 9 In previous reports from Turkey including adults, nearly as low as 40-60% of the patients reported the history of tick bites. 3, 4, 11 However, in our study, 87.0% of the patients reported the history of tick bite, similar to the previous article from Turkey in 2008 including the same age group like our patients, suggesting 71.4% of positive history of tick bite history. 14 This could be because of the increased public awareness of the problem in recent years.",
