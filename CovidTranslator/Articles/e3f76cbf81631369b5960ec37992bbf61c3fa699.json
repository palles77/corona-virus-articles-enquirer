He was transferred from Qatar to a hospital in England where he clinically deteriorated, was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) however, unfortunately had a fatal outcome (6) . A second case in the UK was confirmed in February 2013, in a return traveler from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia who was admitted with severe acute respiratory symptoms. This patient required ECMO treatment however also unfortunately died. This case resulted in onward transmission to two further cases, of which one subsequently died (7) . In August 2018, a fifth case of MERS was diagnosed in a return traveler from the Middle East. The patient was initially admitted to a hospital in Leeds and then transferred to specialist infectious disease unit in Liverpool. The patient had a positive outcome and there was no onward transmission of MERS-CoV to the close contacts (8) As of the end of November 2019, MERS Co-V has infected 2,494 people with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 37.1% (9, 10) and a notably higher CFR in ITU settings (11) . Nosocomial outbreaks have occurred in Saudi Arabia and South Korea demonstrating the need for stringent infection control polices (12) . In view of the high risk of imported cases, Public Health England (PHE) commissioned regional centers to perform MERS-CoV testing for possible MERS cases arriving in England. PHE Manchester laboratory is one of two centers that currently perform Acute respiratory illness (ARI) and contact with a confirmed case of MERS-CoV in the 14 days prior to onset.",

Introduction A novel coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The first case was a Saudi national admitted in June 2012 with pneumonia and renal failure which resulted in a fatal outcome. The case was later identified in September 2012 as a novel betacoronavirus belonging to lineage C (4). Retrospective testing of samples in the Middle East identified a further nine cases in Jordan (5). The disease was considered a clinical syndrome ranging from asymptomatic cases to respiratory failure to multisystem organ failure. The syndrome was termed \"Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome\" (MERS) and testing was performed accordingly in the Middle East and for return travellers from Middle East countries based on epidemiological risk factors.",

Additionally it receives samples from other areas of the North-West region of the United Kingdom which entails the counties of Yorkshire, Humber and also the counties of the North-East region. The Greater Manchester (GM) region has a population of around 2.5 million people with a black and minority ethnic population of 33.4% (13); some of whom are more likely to travel to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the Middle East for visiting friends or family, business, religious pilgrimage or tourism. The GM region also has a Muslim population of 15.8% (1, 14) which is greater than the national average in the United Kingdom of 5% (1). The Muslim population will visit the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) at least once in their lifetime to the holy cities of Mecca & Medina for the compulsory pilgrimage of Hajj. Over 2 million pilgrims from 188 countries attend the Hajj annually which may result in dissemination of MERS-CoV or other pathogens to multiple countries, including to the United Kingdom. Muslims also travel to KSA for Umrah (minipilgrimage) and Ramadan which may increase the possibility of the spread of MERS. Manchester has the UK's third busiest airport (15) with around 27.8 million passengers being processed in 2017. It was specially adapted to accommodate the Airbus A380 which has a capacity of 853 passengers per flight. As a result of this, a significant proportion of passengers return from the Middle East to the Greater Manchester region. Manchester also hosts the North-West region's tertiary Infectious Disease unit. The Regional Infectious Diseases Unit (RIDU) at North Manchester General Hospital accepts direct admissions of returning travelers with fever and consequently assesses a multitude of patients for possible MERS-CoV infection. The PHE Manchester laboratory works closely with RIDU and both provide a 7-day service. We present a detailed analysis of the results of the surveillance for MERS-CoV testing at the PHE Manchester laboratory initially between 2012 to 2013 and then from was carried out in 2012-2013 when the first MERS-CoV case was identified in the UK. There was pause in testing from June 2013 to September 2015 when testing was carried out at PHE Birmingham. From 1st September 2015 to 1st February 2019, returning travellers presenting to any hospital in the North West region with respiratory symptoms from the Middle East were risk assessed for potential MERS-CoV infection. This risk assessment was performed utilizing the PHE MERS criteria with a possible case defined as: 1. A person with severe acute respiratory infection requiring admission to hospital with symptoms of fever (\u2265 38\uf0b0C) or history of fever and evidence of pulmonary parenchymal disease; and at least one of the following: \u2022 History of travel to, or residence in an area where infection with MERS-CoV could have been acquired in the 14-days before symptom onset \u2022 Close contact during the 14-days before onset of illness with a symptomatic confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection \u2022 Person is a healthcare worker based in ICU caring for patients with severe acute respiratory infection, regardless of travel or PPE use \u2022 Part of a cluster of two or more epidemiologically linked cases within a two-week period requiring ICU admission, regardless of history of travel 3.",

However, a limitation in this study is is a low number of patients who have had greater than four samples sent. Although 56% of all samples were PCR positive for a pathogen, if the results were viewed according to patient numbers, 62.1% of all patients had a positive microbiological result. This was due to the bacterial investigations eliciting a positive diagnosis and higher pathogen positivity in patients who have had more than two samples sent. For patient numbers, the most common viral pathogen for the tested patients was Influenza A followed by Rhinovirus. Of total patients, 10% were positive for a bacterial pathogen via PCR testing or culture/antigen results. During 2015, PHE Manchester received the greatest number for MERS Co-V testing in October. This correlates with the post Hajj period (21st to the 26th of September 2015supplementary figure 16). During 2016, the greatest number of samples received was during July (supplementary figure 17).

Of the patients whose travel history was known (145), the majority travelled to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Unfortunately, 123 patients had no travel history documented on the databases demonstrating the need for improving travel history documentation on clinical laboratory request forms. Other patients had travelled to various countries in the Middle East",

            "text": "MERS-CoV endemic country would be very difficult from both logistical and financial perspectives. In this scenario, it would be prudent to test for seroprevalence of MERS-CoV in number of sputum samples received is 120 compared to 270 samples received for nose, throat or combination NT swabs. This finding demonstrates the need for further studies on sample type and PCR positivity of respiratory viruses.Also of note, is the higher positivity rate when a higher number of samples is sent by the referring hospital. For diagnosis of MERS-CoV , PHE Manchester request samples for sputum, nose +/-throat swabs, BAL (if available) and clotted blood. Due to the high clinical workload of the referring hospitals, we received a variable number of samples per patient. In this study we have seen that patients who have greater than four samples sent demonstrated a 100% diagnostic yield compared to 51.1% when one sample per patient was sent. In one specific patient case, six samples were sent of which only 1/6 was positive for Influenza A. We conclude from our observation that four samples or more from a patient should be taken to ensure a viral diagnosis.Although no cases of MERS Coronavirus were identified at PHE Manchester, the majority of patients identified under the PHE MERS criteria had a viral respiratory pathogen for which Neuraminidase inhibitors treatment was indicated and for whom nosocomial isolation was warranted. Respiratory tract viral infections post travel to the Middle east are common and vaccination for influenza is strongly recommended for people travelling to the Middle East for religious purposes. With the positive MERS-CoV case in August 2018 in the UK and previous devastating nosocomial outbreaks of MERS in the world, it is essential to raise awareness of this fatal pathogen. We need to continue proactive investigation and rapidly identify and isolate possible MERS-CoV patients after return from the Middle East. We need to continue surveillance of returning travellers at risk for MERS-CoV infection to not only further the knowledge of this important syndrome but also to facilitate the public health response and management of cases.",
