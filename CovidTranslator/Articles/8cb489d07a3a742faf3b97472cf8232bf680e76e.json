In such a small area, Taiwan has built 22 incinerators over a short span of time, combusting large amount of municipal solid waste as much as 23,250 tons per day. This study focuses on the history of construction and development of incinerators in Taiwan as well as the characteristics of pollutants, such as heavy metals (Pb, Cd, and Hg), acid gases (NO x , SO x , CO, and HCl), and dioxins emitted from the incinerators. Furthermore, the study also covers the generation and composition of municipal solid waste (MSW), and the production of energy in Taiwan. According to Taiwan's data on pollutant emissions, the emission level of pollutants is under control and meets the stringent regulations of Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (TEPA). Researches have shown that using air pollution control devices (APCDs) in the operation of incinerators provides effective measures for air pollutant control in Taiwan. The main advantage of using incinerators is the generation of electricity (waste-to-energy) during the incineration of municipal solid waste, producing energy that can be consumed by the general public and the industry. Taiwan's extensive experience in incinerator construction and operation may serve as an example for developing countries in devising waste treatment technology, energy recovery, and the control of contagious viral diseases.",

In densely populated areas like Taiwan, finding space for additional landfills is becoming difficult. Beginning in the 1990s, however, alternative waste treatment technologies have become widely available. For instance, incineration functions as an alternative to landfill and biological treatment methods such as composting process and anaerobic digestion.",

Over the decades, the economic improvement has led to the increasing amount of MSW, causing serious environmental harms such as air quality deterioration and river water pollution. In order to speed up nation's MSW treatment and resources recycling, the Taiwan government has formulated policies concerning the reduction of waste volume in recent years. In correspondence, since 1990 the TEPA has devised the construction of a number of MSW incinerators to solve the MSW problem. By 2007, Taiwan has 22 MSW incineration refuse plants in operation. The volume of MSW materials and the treatment rate by incineration in 2006 are 7,336,496 tons and 53.34%, respectively, [9] .",

The cooling process then leads to the condensation of high volatility metallic vapors through both homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous condensation on the surface of fly ash, therefore discharging toxic metals from MSW incinerator [6, 11] . Nonetheless, pollutants produced by incinerators can be reduced by using air pollution control devices (APCDs).",

For instance, SO x and NO x react with other substances in the air to form acids, and precipitate in the forms of rain, fog, snow, or dry particles. The incinerator generates NO x in two ways: (1) N 2 and O 2 in air will react during the high temperature incineration process, producing NO x (called as thermal NO x ); (2) nitrogen compounds found in either fuel or MSW are oxidized to form NO x (also called as fuel NO x ) [29] . SO x are generated during the combustion of sulfur or materials containing sulfur [6] . Generally, CO is generated by the incomplete combustion of any fuel containing carbon compounds. It can easily react with the hemoglobin in blood and prevent oxygen transfer; people who expose to high concentration of CO may have health risk [30] . According to the statistical data from TEPA, the composition of MSW in Taiwan was including moisture, plastic, kitchen garbage, paper, metal and so on [9] (see Table 2 ). Most chlorine presents in the plastic and kitchen waste will be released in incineration process and react with hydrogen to form HCl. HCl and some organic compounds are the precursors of dioxins in MSW incinerators [31, 32] . Fluorine that presents in the MSW may also react with hydrogen to form HF. However, according to previous study [33] , the concentration of HF emitted from MSW incinerator is 0.1 mg/m 3 . The concentration of HF emitted is too low compared with HCl ($16 mg/m 3 ).",

            "text": "Analysis of MSW composition is complicated due to the mixture of various waste materials. Therefore, controlling the compositions of MSW is important for incinerator operation. Basically, the composition of MSW can be divided into two parts; one is combustible waste, including paper, fiber, rubber, kitchen waste, and plastic; and the other is noncombustible waste like metal, glass and moisture. Table 5 describes the breakdown of the MSW composition in Taiwan and the basic chemical analysis of waste in Table 1 The operation profiles of the incinerators in Taiwan Table  5 . According to data on the chemical analysis of MSW between the period of 1998 and 2005, Table 5 shows a decreasing trend in the proportion of ash and organic chlorine, and an increasing percentage of sulfur in MSW composition. In the meantime, other composition items presented in Table 5 indicate a stable trend. The trends show that people in Taiwan have become more concerned with the clearance of MSW and placed more importance on resource recycling. For instance, while the percentage of the combustible waste increased annually, the percentage of noncombustible waste became less owing to the separate collection of particular categories of waste from MSW over the years. The statistical data presented in Table 5 suggest the success of Taiwan's policies in promoting resource recycling. After the construction of the first incinerator in 1991, incineration began to be a trend in the treatment of MSW in Taiwan gradually. As shown in Table 1 , until October 2006, approximately 53.34% of MSW was treated by incineration, while resource recycling and landfill accounted for 27.34% and 11.66%, respectively. The rate of incineration and resource recycling in MSW treatment increased significantly from 1991 to 2004. Contrary, the rate of landfill decreased significantly and now only accounts for a small fraction of MSW treatment in Taiwan. This phenomenon indicates that incineration had been considered as the main treatment method for MSW in Taiwan at the present. The data depicted in Table 3 describes the rate of garbage disposal, which increased from 60.2% to 99.75% in the period of 1991 to October 2006. As we can see, the rate of landfill from 1991 to 2006 (including both general landfill and sanitary landfill) decreased significantly due to the construction and operation of incinerators. Compared with landfill, incineration takes less space, provides faster treatment of MSW, materials, and is more efficient than landfill. Therefore, incineration can be considered as the best alternative to landfill for a densely populated country like Taiwan. However, in addition to waste treatment techniques, factors like government policies, public's level of environmental awareness, and resource recycling (including resource recycling, waste bulk recycling, and wastes food recycling) will also play an important role in the future treatment of MSW.",

As a result, the TEPA decided in 1986 to adopt incineration as the primary method for waste treatment and landfill as secondary. Consequently, in 1990, the TEPA proposed a plan called ''Construction Project for MSW Resource Recovery Plants [51] \" for MSW treatment.

According to the emission regulations of incinerators in Taiwan [54] , the environmental protection standards of these three heavy metals (Pb, Cd and Hg) were found to be 0.2, 0.02 and 0.05 mg/Nm 3 , respectively. Fig. 2 shows the trend of heavy metals emitted from each incinerator in Taiwan during 2002-2006. Due to the improvement of flue gas treatment instrument/technique and the policy of resource recovery, all incinerators met the regulations of TEPA in heavy metal emission. Many studies have indicated that conventional air pollution control devices such as bag house, wet, semi-dry, and dry scrubber also can effective in collecting metallic particulates. As the improvement of instruments, the emission of heavy metals should be reduced gradually by year. Further, Metallic materials such as waste metal containers, and waste dry cell batteries commonly exist in MSW. Before incineration, separating these metallic materials from MSW can reduce the concentration of metals in flue gas. Therefore, this led the emission of heavy metals decreased. The average concentration of heavy metals decreased from 2002 to 2006. It demonstrates that the control of heavy metals emitted from incinerators in Taiwan improved every year. Fig. 2 compares the emission concentration among three metals with the new environmental protection standards along with previous one. Comparing both regulations, new environmental protection standards were much stricter than the previous one (Table 7) . With more stringent regulations, people in Taiwan became more concerned about the pollutants, and this inevitably led to the improvement of incinerator operation and preservation techniques. concentration of NO x in some incinerators was decreased. The average concentration range of NO x emission was found to be 70-120 ppm.",

The preferences may change again 20 years from now to the order of preferences like the elimination of viruses and bacteria, energy recovery, and waste treatment. MSW, medical waste, and poultry farm waste may produce different bacteria and viruses. These viruses may lead to the generation of different contagious diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a rare contagious disease like Bird flu. Incineration treatment of MSW and medical waste can avoid these infectious viruses and generation of energy for public and industrial utilization.

From the historical information and data presented here, most of Taiwan's MSW is treated by incineration. Emission characteristics of incineration in Taiwan showed that heavy metals, acid gases and dioxins are the major pollutants, and shed light on how these pollutants can be controlled by maintaining stable conditions. The amount of pollutants emitted during the past few years follows a decreasing trend, and the level of all emitted pollutants meet the environmental regulations of Taiwan. In the future, there is a possibility that developing countries may adopt incineration technology for the treatment of MSW and generation of renewable energy.

To control CO, the main way was to improve the combustion efficiency of incinerator by operating under optimum conditions. Well operation may reduce the opportunity of CO generation as well as decrease the emission of other pollutants.

The result showed that SCR system performed better removal efficiency than ACI system (removal efficiency SCR:ACI = 99.5%:94.3%). Applying catalyst can destroy dioxins effectively; activated carbon only absorbs dioxins during the phase of dioxin transfer. In their research, the results indicated that the patterns of dioxin isomers at the APCD inlet and stack are similar for both municipal wastes incinerators. The dioxin concentration at the APCDs inlet of incinerator with cyclones, dry spray tower and fabric filter was 2.75 times higher than the incinerator that uses electrostatic precipitators followed by wet scrubbers. The dioxin removal efficiency reached 98.6% in 2000 after continuous injection of activated carbon (43.4 mg/Nm 3 ) for one year. The lower efficiency achieved with ACI in 1999 can be attributed to the memory effect.",
