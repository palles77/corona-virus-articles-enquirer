OUTCOMES PHQ-9 Scale was used to measure the depression symptoms. A cutoff of \u2265 10 has been recommended for diagnosis of major depression, which provides adequate sensitivity (88.0 percent) and specificity (88.0 percent) 11 . GAD-7 Scale was used to identify anxiety disorders. A cutoff score \u2265 8 is recommended to identify clinically important anxiety symptoms, with adequate specificity (82.0 percent) and sensitivity (77.0 percent) 12 . IES-R is a 22-item self-reported measure applied to assess subjective stress caused by traumatic event, describing the three symptoms including avoidance, intrusion, and hyperarousal. We defined the psychological stress when the IES-R score \uff1e 33 points 13 . The selected 3 questionnaires had good internal consistency with Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficients of more than 0.80.",

Statistical analyses to identify influencing factors were performed using SPSS 22.0 (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL) . The Depression, Anxiety and Psychological Stress nomograms were formulated based on the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis using the R packages \"rms\", \"Hmisc\" and \"ggplot2\" in R 3.5.2 (http://www.r-project.org/). The performances of the nomograms were measured by Concordance statistics (C-statistics) and assessed by calibration curves. Bootstraps with 1000 resamples were applied to these activities. The higher C-statistics indicate better ability to distinguish HWs with different risks of three outcomes. We considered the risk screening models as a useful clinical tool particularly when the C-statistic is higher than 0.70 14 . The calibration curves were used to compare the observed probability with the predicted probability. Dots on the calibration plot would be close to a 45\u00b0 diagonal line if the model calibration is correct.",

In addition, 693 (15.1 percent) HWs were not infected themselves, but their relatives and family members were diagnosed or suspected of COVID-19. HWs had a significantly increased risk of depression once infected with the COVID-19 virus, and increased risks of anxiety, depression, and stress once their family members or relatives were infected with the COVID-19 virus. The results of the subgroup analyses provided more details and indicated that we should employ stratified psychological intervention strategies according to different risk levels of HWs. We should keep track of the mental status of those HWs who were confirmed or suspected patients themselves and who had confirmed or suspected patients in their families. All rights reserved.

Meanwhile, in line with the results of previous studies in the SARS isolation unit, we also found that HWs in isolation wards have a more pronounced risk of stress 23 . Those who had two or more children showed a higher risk of stress, probably owing to their heavier family responsibilities. To make matters worse, the majority of HWs are female (85.0 percent in this study), since a large number of studies have confirmed the plight of working women 18 . Priority consideration should be given to female HWs. In our study, the exercise habit was associated with a lower risk of anxiety symptoms, suggesting that physical activity helps alleviate psychological impact caused by catastrophic events. Nevertheless, only 857 (16.9 percent) participants had exercise habits, indicating that the importance of exercise should be highlighted among HWs in China.",
