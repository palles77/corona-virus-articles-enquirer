Survival for lung transplant recipients continues to lag behind that of other solid organ transplant recipients, with a median survival (\"half-life\") of 5.5 years. 1 Graft failure and non-cytomegalovirus (non-CMV) infection remain the major reported causes of postoperative mortality in the first year after transplantation. After the first year, the most common identifiable causes for mortality are bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and non-CMV infection. Immunosuppression contributes significantly to posttransplant infections in all recipients; however, lung transplant recipients are generally more intensively immunosuppressed than other solid organ recipients and have more frequent and more severe infectious complications. In addition, factors such as preoperative microorganism colonization, transmission of infectious agents from the donor organs, blunted cough mechanism due to denervation, impaired mucociliary clearance, poor lymphatic drainage, ischemic large airways in the immediate postoperative period, and constant exposure to the environment uniquely place lung transplant recipients at higher risk for infections than other organ recipients. 2 Chronic allograft rejection, in the form of BOS, is the major life-limiting complication after lung transplantation. Pulmonary infections with viruses, including CMV; gram-negative bacilli, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and Aspergillus species have all been associated with an increased risk of BOS. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] These findings underscore the importance of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infections in the population that has undergone lung transplantation.",

Gram-negative organisms are the most frequent cause of bacterial pneumonia, with P aeruginosa being the most common. Other gram-negative organisms identified less frequently include, but are not limited to, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, and Serratia marcescens. De novo colonization of the airways with P aeruginosa after transplantation has been demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for the development of BOS. 6 Staphylococcus aureus is the most common gram-positive organism causing pneumonia and the second most common specific organism causing bacterial pneumonia among lung transplant recipients. 10, 11 Infection with B cepacia has historically been associated with poor outcomes after transplantation, and many centers consider chronic infection with B cepacia an absolute contraindication to lung transplantion. 12, 13 However, it has since been recognized that organisms formally classified as B cepacia represent a group complex (B cepacia complex, BCC) comprising several distinct species (genomovars). Burkholderia cenocepacia (genomovar III) and Burkholderia multivorans (genomovar II) account for the majority of infections. 14 B cenocepacia is associated with a much higher risk of posttransplant mortality, including a 6-fold higher risk of death at 1 year compared with patients infected with BCC organisms other than B cenocepacia and an 8-fold higher risk of death at 1 year compared with patients not infected with any BCC organism. 15 In that series, BCC infection with organisms other than B cenocepacia did not increase the risk of death after transplantation in comparison with patients not infected with BCC. B cenocepacia can cause pneumonia, locally invasive disease with empyema, and disseminated infection. Although not a member of the BCC, Burkholderia gladioli has also been associated with an increased mortality. 16 Transplant centers have to consider the specific species of Burkholderia and the risk of B cenocepacia infection when evaluating patients with CF infected with these organisms.",

In contrast, controversy exists on the optimal approach for recipients at medium risk (D \u00c0 /R 1 or D 1 /R 1 ) for CMV disease. One strategy involves universal prophylaxis for all at-risk patients. The second strategy is based on monitoring and preemptive therapy at the time of identification of active viral replication, ideally before symptomatic infection. Using this strategy, medium-risk patients are monitored frequently (once to twice weekly), screening either for viral pp65 antigenemia or with a plasma polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for CMV. Assays vary, and different virology laboratory tests have different thresholds of positivity. At present, fewer centers rely on testing for pp65 antigenemia because the PCR assay has become more widely available and is less prone to technical errors.

            "text": "Concerning prophylactic therapy, most centers either start with intravenous ganciclovir and then transition to oral valganciclovir or administer oral valganciclovir from the outset. Valganciclovir is typically administered at a dose of 900 mg orally daily for prophylaxis in patients with normal renal function, but the dose may need to be adjusted in the setting of low body mass or leukopenia. 18 The most frequent adverse effects from ganciclovir or valganciclovir therapy are leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. There is also a small risk of ganciclovir resistance in patients on prophylaxis, especially if treatment is periodically interrupted. In addition, a limitation of prophylaxis for a given time course is shifting the timeline of CMV disease to a later time point after transplantation. CMV-specific immunoglobulin (Cytogam) is used at few centers as part of the prophylactic regimen for high-risk patients. 19 No randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the superiority of universal prophylaxis over a preemptive strategy. However, one large multicenter trial demonstrated that in at-risk patients, 12 months of prophylaxis with valganciclovir was superior to 3 months after 13 months of follow-up with respect to CMV infection, with no change in acute rejection, CMV UL97 ganciclovir resistance mutations, or laboratory abnormalities. 20 The term CMV infection applies to any situation in which viral replication is identified. CMV disease indicates CMV infection with symptoms, including mononucleosis-like syndrome with fever, malaise, and fatigue, or organ-specific invasion involving the lung (Fig. 1) , liver, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, or retina. 21 As discussed earlier, there is no universal standard of the viral load cutoff that represents a positive blood PCR result. However, if symptoms are present, the general consensus is to initiate treatment of CMV infection. Standard therapy includes intravenous ganciclovir, 5 mg/kg twice daily, or oral valganciclovir, 900 mg twice daily, with dose adjustments for renal function and leukocyte count. Oral valganciclovir has been shown to be noninferior to intravenous ganciclovir in a mixed population of transplant recipients and can be considered as initial therapy, especially in patients with subclinical CMV infection and mild disease. 22,23 Antiviral therapy is generally continued for at least 1 week after viral replication is no longer detectable. CMV-specific immunoglobulin can be used as add-on therapy in severe cases or in patients not responding to initial therapy, especially in seronegative recipients. In patients not responding to conventional therapy, resistance to ganciclovir must be evaluated. The UL 97 gene encodes a protein kinase involved in the phosphorylation and activation of ganciclovir, and mutations within this gene are the most common mechanisms of ganciclovir resistance. Mutations within the UL54 region, which encodes for CMV DNA polymerase, also confer ganciclovir resistance and are more likely to result in resistance to cidofovir and foscarnet. Many patients with UL 97 mutations, and some with UL54 mutations, respond to therapy with cidofovir or foscarnet; however, drug toxicity is the major obstacle to treatment.",

At our center, patients with a positive result for nasopharyngeal viral swab for RSV are treated with 3 days of inhaled ribavirin therapy.

In transplant recipients, the major morbidity of EBV is posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). There are 2 major subtypes of PTLD. Polymorphic PTLD is characterized by a monoclonal B-cell population in various stages of maturation and reactive T cells. Monomorphic PTLD is characterized by homogenous sheets of transformed monoclonal B cells, frequently with cytogenetic abnormalities. Monomorphic PTLD is a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 27 PTLD occurs in the setting of immunosuppression, and evidence of EBV infection has been identified in as many as 80% to 90% of patients with PTLD. 28, 29 PTLD frequently occurs in the first year after transplantation but can present years later. Among transplant recipients, those who have undergone heart and lung transplants are at the highest risk of developing PTLD, which is likely related to the higher intensity of immunosuppression maintained in these patients. 30 The reported incidence of PTLD after lung transplantation varies between 2.5% and 8%, with a recent series identifying 34 cases in 705 patients (4.8%) who had undergone lung transplantation at a single center. 31 PTLD frequently occurs in the transplanted organ, and, in lung recipients, this neoplasm can present as solitary or multiple pulmonary nodules or masses, hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, or a pleural effusion. In general, cases of PTLD that develop in the first year after lung transplantation tend to be isolated to the chest, but cases that develop beyond the first year after transplantation tend to be extrathoracic, often involving the abdomen and pelvis. 32, 33 It is noteworthy that late extrathoracic cases tend to have a worse prognosis and are less likely to respond to de-escalation of immunosuppression.",

Serum PCR testing for EBV has been evaluated as a tool to aid in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with PTLD. While the specificity of a positive test in patients with PTLD is near 100%, the sensitivity has been reported to be as low as 40% because many patients with pathologically confirmed PTLD will have negative serum EBV PCR results. 34 The initial treatment of PTLD is generally a deescalation of immunosuppression. 35 There is an increased risk of allograft rejection with this approach. The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab (Rituxan) is the next line of therapy for PTLD. Rituximab is used when remission is not achieved with reduced immunosuppression. In addition, recent studies suggest that administering rituximab earlier in the course of PTLD improves the response and duration of remission. 36, 37 If reducing immunosuppression and administration of rituximab does not induce remission of PTLD, systemic chemotherapy with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) is usually administered. Surgical resection can be curative in cases of PTLD with localized disease. Radiation therapy can also be considered in cases of local diseases that are not amenable to surgical resection. When performed, both surgery and radiation should be combined with a reduction in immunosuppression with or without rituximab.",

In addition, azoles have a potent interaction with calcineurin inhibitors, and the cyclosporine (Neoral) or tacrolimus (Prograf) doses need to be significantly reduced when itraconazole or voriconazole are inititated. 41 Candida Species Infections C albicans remains the most common Candida species causing fungal infections in lung transplant recipients but a shift toward non-albicans species has been observed. 10 Clinical patterns of candidiasis in lung transplantation recipients range from mucocutaneous to invasive disease, with candidemia and multiorgan involvement. Although C albicans is generally sensitive to azole agents, including fluconazole, some non-albicans Candida species are resistant to fluconazole. Several recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of echinocandins in invasive candidiasis and should be considered as a first-line treatment pending identification and speciation of the Candida species in culture. [49] [50] [51] Amphotericin B is effective for invasive candidiasis; however, given its toxicity and the effectiveness of safer echinocandins and azoles, it should be reserved for treatment failures or patients who are intolerant of echinocandins and are infected by organisms that are resistant to azole agents. P jiroveci P jiroveci (formerly Pneumocystis carinii) is an organism that is ubiquitous in the environment and can cause pneumonia in any immunosuppressed patient. In the era of prophylaxis, it is rare for patients to develop P jiroveci pneumonia. 52 The first-line prophylactic is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra), although in patients who are allergic to sulfa drugs alternative options include inhaled pentamidine (Pentam), atovaquone (Mepron), and dapsone. This infection is treated with high doses of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, often with an increase in the corticosteroid dose, especially when complicated by hypoxemia. 53 In patients who are allergic to sulfa drugs, desensitization can be considered in order to use trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for either prophylaxis or treatment in the event of Pneumocystis pneumonia.",
