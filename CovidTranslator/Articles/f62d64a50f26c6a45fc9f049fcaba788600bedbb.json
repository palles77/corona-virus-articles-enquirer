The simple genomes and rapid evolution of many viruses mean they are useful model systems for studying parallel evolution by natural selection. Parallel adaptation occurs in the context of several viral behaviours, including cross-species transmission, drug resistance, and host immune escape, and its existence suggests that at least some aspects of virus evolution and emergence are repeatable and predictable. We introduce examples of virus parallel evolution and summarise key concepts. We outline the difficulties in detecting parallel adaptation using virus genomes, with a particular focus on phylogenetic and structural approaches, and we discuss future approaches that may improve our understanding of the phenomenon.",

Parallel evolution manifests itself in a variety of ways, from the repeated fixation of single point mutations or larger genetic changes (e.g. indels or genome rearrangements) [2] , to the evolution of structural, functional or behavioural phenotypes. The terms 'parallel' and 'convergent' evolution are sometimes given distinct definitions: convergent evolution refers to the independent evolution of similar traits from different ancestral starting points [3] , whereas parallel evolution describes the independent emergence of similar traits from the same state [4] . Here, we use 'parallel' to refer to both situations. Further, we use 'adaptation' to refer to evolutionary change through positive natural selection, and 'evolution' to encompass change via any process (e.g. by random genetic drift).",

Barriers to virus replication in a new host may include (i) lack suitable receptors for virus cell entry, (ii) innate and adaptive immune responses, (iii) reduced replication efficacy in specific cell types, and (iv) mechanisms of virion release from infected cells [17 ] . For example, HIV-1 groups M, N and O are derived from separate cross-species transmissions to humans of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) in chimpanzees and gorillas. Following spillover, these groups independently acquired a Met ! Arg amino acid change in the retroviral Gag protein [18] . Under experimental conditions, this mutation increases SIV replication in human lymphoid tissue [19] . Rabies virus (RABV) offers another example: the RABV lineage that infects dogs has changed host species on multiple occasions, causing outbreaks in other Carnivora species. Amongst these events, parallel amino acid changes were observed in two separate RABV zoonoses from dogs to ferret-badgers (a Leu ! Ser mutation in the RABV nucleoprotein and a Lys ! Arg change in the polymerase) [5] .",

Determining whether a given site or genomic region has Parallel molecular evolution and adaptation in viruses Gutierrez, Escalera-Zamudio and Pybus 91 evolved under natural selection can be achieved by comparing the relative rates of synonymous (d S ) and non-synonymous (d N ) changes, quantified as a d N /d S ratio [27] . Because positive selection can act on specific sites at particular points in time, it is important to explore variation in d N /d S amongst sites and amongst virus lineages. Several methods are available to undertake such calculations [28] [29] [30] . If d N /d S > 1 for a specific codon, then multiple amino acid changes have likely occurred at that codon, and the codon is a candidate for the detection of parallel evolution (see below). However, d N /d S methods have limitations and may fail to detect instances of sites under selection [29] . In particular, some studies report that d N /d S tests have failed to identify sites that appear to have undergone parallel adaptation [5, 31] .",

A powerful method for detecting repeated, independent evolution is comparative phylogenetics, which infers the evolutionary history of a given trait (including reconstruction of ancestral states) using parsimony or other phylogenetic models [32] .

It is tempting to detect associations between a mutation and a phenotype by calculating the mutation frequencies in viruses that do or do not exhibit the relevant phenotype. This generates a contingency table of observed counts (Figure 1 ) that is evaluated using a Chi-squared or Fisher's exact test. However, it has long been known in the evolutionary literature that this approach can lead to false positive conclusions, because the counts are not independent observations, but instead are correlated due to shared ancestry [33, 34] . The problem can be resolved by considering the phylogenetic history of the trait in question ( Figure 1 ). Specifically, recurrent acquisition of a mutation in the context of independent changes in phenotype ( Figure 1b) indicates that the mutation is evolutionarily linked to the phenotype. However, if mutation and phenotypic change occur only once in the phylogeny (Figure 1a ) then their association could be due to chance. Bhattacharya et al.

Flaviviruses provide many examples of the importance of RNA structures for viral replication [46] and host adaptation [41] , some of which are proposed to have arisen through parallel evolution [47] ; different functional roles have been inferred for RNA structures in other viruses [48, 49] . Evaluating the effects of natural selection on RNA genome regions encoding for secondary structures represents an additional challenge because (i) our understanding of how such structures evolve is poor, and (ii) it is difficult to define neutrally evolving sites in such regions [50] , which limits the use of d N /d S estimation methods, and our limited knowledge of the degree to which non-coding elements are structurally constrained. Various approaches have been developed to test for selection on non-coding regions [51] and to predict the secondary structure of RNA molecules [52, 53] , but to date their use has been limited in evolutionary analyses of viruses.

If, in a rapidly evolving virus population, parallel mutations repeatedly arise in the context of the same change in phenotype or environment (i.e. Figure 1b) , then at least some aspects of virus evolution are predictable. Such repeating patterns, at the sequence or structural level, may help to forecast virus emergence and cross-species transmission events in the future. Further, placing these changes within a structural context could be used to triage newly discovered viruses, enabling surveillance and research to focus on those with the greatest predicted propensity for cross-species transmission or emergence. We note, however, that instances of parallel evolution identified by computational means must be interpreted with caution; confirmation of the fitness costs of evolutionary change ultimately depends on experimental validation, as shown for some recent outbreak scenarios [55, 56] . A number of experimental techniques are now available to link virus genotypes to phenotypes, including pseudotyping [57 ] , minigenome systems [58] , viral reverse genetics [59] , and site-directed mutagenesis [60] . These and related approaches are vital to determining the functional role of viral mutations and their effects on virus and host fitness.",

            "text": "Current challenges for inferring parallel molecular evolution are twofold. First, to better understand and predict parallel adaptation, and apply it to the specific scenario of virus emergence, we need a model that describes how the phenomenon depends on factors such as mutation rates, population sizes, selection coefficients and genome evolvability. Second, improvements in statistical methods and software are needed to make it easier to test parallel evolution hypotheses in the correct way. Advances have been made in testing specific phenomena associated with parallel evolution, such as coevolution [61] and episodic selection [28, 30] ; however, an integrated inference framework that maximises the accuracy of site identification, and is robust to confounding processes such as recombination and genetic hitchhiking is still required. New high throughput experimental approaches, such as deep mutational scanning, have been applied to virus pathogens and will provide more comprehensive information on the mutability of virus proteins [62 ,63] . Results from similar empirical approaches, combined with the rapid growth of genome sequences for viruses from multiple hosts and ecosystems, will provide a broader evidence base for virus parallel evolution during virus emergence.",
