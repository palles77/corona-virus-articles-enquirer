Here, we describe our participation in a weekly prospective ILI forecasting challenge for the United States for the 2016-17 season and subsequent evaluation of our performance. We implemented a metapopulation model framework with 32 model variants. Variants differed from each other in their assumptions about: the force-of-infection (FOI); use of uninformative priors; the use of discounted historical data for not-yet-observed time points; and the treatment of regions as either independent or coupled. Individual model variants were chosen subjectively as the basis for our weekly forecasts; however, a subset of coupled models were only available part way through the season. Most frequently, during the 2016-17 season, we chose; FOI variants with both school vacations and humidity terms; uninformative priors; the inclusion of discounted historical data for not-yet-observed time points; and coupled regions (when available). Our near-term weekly forecasts substantially over-estimated incidence early in the season when coupled models were not available. However, our forecast accuracy improved in absolute terms and relative to other teams once coupled solutions were available. In retrospective analysis, we found that the 2016-17 season was not typical: on average, coupled models performed better when fit without historically augmented data. Also, we tested a simple ensemble model for the 2016-17 season and found that it underperformed our subjective choice for all forecast targets. In this study, we were able to improve accuracy during a prospective forecasting exercise by coupling dynamics between regions. Although reduction of forecast subjectivity should be a long-term goal, some degree of human intervention is likely to improve forecast accuracy in the medium-term in parallel with the systematic consideration of more sophisticated ensemble approaches.",

This uncertainty 18 is most acute and shared globally during the initial stages of emergence of novel human 19 pathogens such as SARS [2], pandemic influenza [3], or the Zika virus [4] . However, at 20 national and sub-national levels, uncertainty arises frequently for epidemic pathogens 21 such as seasonal influenza, dengue, RSV and rotavirus; causing problems both for 22 health planners and at-risk individuals who may consider changing their behavior to 23 mitigate their risk during peak periods. 24 Seasonal influenza affects populations in all global regions and is forecast annually in 25 temperate populations, either implicitly or explicitly [5]. Peak demand for both 26 outpatient and inpatient care is driven by peak incidence of influenza in many years [6]. 27 Therefore, the efficient provision of elective procedures and other non-seasonal health 28 care can be improved by accurate forecasts of seasonal influenza. Implicitly, most 29 temperate health systems use knowledge of historical scenarios with which to plan for 30 their influenza season.

In 2006 60 Schappert and Burt [18] studied the National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys 61 (NAMCS) and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys (NHAMCS) 62 and calculated an ambulatory rate of 3.8 visits per capita-year.

SH is included in DICE as a potential modifier 72 of transmissibility for this time period and uses Phase-2 of the North American Land 73 Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2) data base provided by NASA [21-23]. The 74 NLDAS-2 data base provides hourly specific humidity (measured 2-meters above the 75 ground) for the continental US at a spatial grid of 0.125 \u2022 which we average to daily and 76 weekly values. The weekly data is then spatially-averaged for the states and CDC 77 regions. 78 School vacation schedules were collected for the 2014-15 and 2015-16 academic years for 79 every state. For each state, a school district was identified to represent each of the three 80 largest cities. Vacation schedules were then collected directly from the district websites. 81 These three school vacation schedules were first processed to a weekly schedule with a 82 value of 0 indicating class was in session all five weekdays and a 1 indicating five 83 vacation days. Next, the representative state schedule was produced by averaging the 84 three weekly district schedules. Region schedules are obtained by a population-weighted 85 average of the state schedules. Similarly, the national schedule is generated by a 86 population-weighted average of the regions. 87 For the 2016-17 season we determine start and end times as well as spring and fall 88 breaks from the previous years schedules. Thanksgiving and winter vacation timing was 89 taken from the calendar where the winter break is assumed to be the last two calendar 90 weeks of the year. Based on the proportion of schools closed and number of days closed, 91 p(t) is assigned a value in the range [0, 1]. For example in week t i , if all schools are 92 closed for the entire week then we define the proportion of open schools p(t i ) = 1. 93 However, if all schools have Monday and Tuesday off (missing 2 of 5 days), then 94 p(t i ) = 0.4. Similarly, if 3 of 10 schools have spring break (entire week off), but the 95 other 7 schools have a full week of class then p(t i ) = 0.3. If all schools have a full week 96 of class then p(t i ) = 0.",

Two weeks before the peak week (and 380 three weeks early in the season) we started predicting the correct peak intensity of 5.1% 381 (to within \u00b10.5%). The mean and median historic values are significantly lower (4.4% 382 and 4.1% respectively) and outside the \u00b10.5% range. Our apparent forecast 383 performance for intensity appears to drop off at the end of the season. However, this is 384 an artifact of the forecasting work flow. Once the peak had clearly passed, the final 385 model was selected for reasons other than the peak intensity and the already-observed 386 peak intensity was submitted.",

Each 213 region has its own informed prior which is allowed to change from one epidemic week to 214 the other. The Gaussian informed prior provides a simple way to penalize the likelihood 215 when the parameter values sampled by the MCMC procedure are far from what was observed in a past similar season.
