However, ter-process involved on the ribosome for the release of a polypeptide chain from the tRNA carrying the last amino acid incorporated in this polypeptide, a process that occurs when the ribosome encounters one of the so-called termination or nonsense codons. The denomination 'termination' codon suggests that such codons specify the end of the elongation of the polypeptide chain; the denomination 'nonsense' codon suggests that these codons cannot be recognized by any tRNA. The so-called termination or nonsense codons are the three codons UAA (ochre), UAG (amber) and UGA (opal) that are found at the end of coding regions on mRNAs. However, this classical definition was jeopardized by the discovery that UGA specifies Trp in mitochondria [l] and by the existence of variations from the standard genetic code in many organisms.",

Tetrahymena thermophila, Stylonichia lemnae and Paramecium primaurelia or tetraurefia, all use UGA as sole termination codon. UAA interrupts the ORF of the histone H3 [3] and cu-tubulin [4] genes in T. thermophila and S. lemnae respectively, whereas both UAA and UAG interrupt the ORF of the variable surface antigen [5, 6] in the Paramecia; in all cases UAA and UAG encode Gln codons. A Gln-tRNA and its gene have been isolated from T. thermophila with an anticodon sequence complementary to the UAA codon [7] . This Gln-tRNA\",ua recognizes in vitro both the UAA and the UAG codons [8] . Although a Gln-tRNA with a 5 ' -CUA-3 ' anticodon, complementary to the UAG codon has also been found [8] , none of the available gene sequences to date show internal UAG codons in T. thermophila. In addition to UAA and possibly UAG, the standard CAA and CAG codons are used to specify Gln but they are decoded by a Gin-tRNAu,uo [8] . The finding that different versions of the code are encountered in the nucleus of ciliates and in the mitochondria of various other eukaryotic organisms affects the concept of the 'universality' of the genetic code and makes it necessary to relate 2 the mechanism of termination to a given organism.",

Comparing the sequence of the mammalian RF with the prokaryotic and ciliate counterparts would help in pinpointing regions of the RF involved in recognition of the termination codons and in GTP binding. Indeed, prokaryotes use three different RFs for recognition of UAA and UAG, UAA and UGA, and GTP respectively (in addition to GTP recognition, RF3 stimulates binding of RF1 and RF2 to the ribosome-termination codon complex). Thus, it could be speculated that domains related to these three different activities should be found in the unique mammalian RF. On the other hand, the putative ciliate RF, which should only recognize the UGA codon, would have a single UGA recognition domain in addition to a GTP-binding domain.",

Since nonsense suppressor tRNAs can outcompete RF [ 1 l] for their common target, parameters that influence the activity of the former should be taken into consideration to understand the activity of the latter. In particular, the demonstration that certain codon contexts around the termination codon favour nonsense suppression (see section 4.2.1) suggests that other contexts can be favourable for termination [ 121. Finally, the recent finding that an Escherichia coli nonsense suppressor mutant is mutated in the 16 S ribosomal RNA [13] opens the door to new experiments aimed at defining the sites in the ribosome involved in the interaction with the RF.",

            "text": "The first group of natural suppressor tRNAs has been investigated in a study of gene expression in tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), a plant virus with an RNA genome of ' + ' polarity. Translation of the genomic RNA of this virus gives rise to two overlapping proteins initiated at the same AUG codon but differing in their C-terminal region. It was first demonstrated in vitro that the longer 183 kDa protein results from the readthrough of a leaky UAG termination codon located at the end of the gene of the shorter I26 kDa protein [18] . This was later confirmed by determining the nucleotide sequence of the viral RNA genome [19] . The observation that both proteins are also produced in vivo in tobacco protoplasts [20] led to the search for the tRNA species responsible for this natural suppression. Two closely related Tyr-tRNAs, with a 5'-GlkA-3' anticodon, that specifically stimulate the readthrough of the TMV UAG codon in vitro, were isolated from uninfected tobacco leaves [21] . A Tyr-tRNA isolated from Drosophila melanogaster, also bearing a 5 '-G!PA-3 ' anticodon, had already been shown to act as natural UAG suppressor during in vitro translation of TMV RNA [22] . Interestingly, the Tyr isoacceptor isolated from either system and bearing a 5 ' -Q!PA-3 ' anticodon (Q is a hypermodified G base) is inactive in amber suppression. This observation suggests that the presence of the Q modification in the wobble position of the anticodon restricts recognition of the tRNA to the cognate UAC and UAU Tyr codons whereas the presence of an unmodified G permits the additional recognition of UAG. A correlation between suppression activity and undermodification in the wobble position was also observed in wheat germ [23] and lupin tRNAs [24] .",

On the contrary, the presence of a bulky side chain which projects out of the Q!PA anticodon loop [25] , would prevent by steric hindrance the Q nucleoside from adopting such a conformation. From a structural point of view this model would support the molecular basis for suppression of the TMV amber codon. However, recent crystal structure analyses of synthetic oligomers show that non-Watson-Crick pairings occur in B-DNA and that they do not involve the unusual 'syn-anti' but rather an 'anti-anti' base conformation [26, 27] .

Thus, they differ from authentic suppressor tRNAs that specifically read termination codons. Such nonsense suppressors, initially isolated from bovine liver, have now been discovered in human, avian and Xenopus laevis tissues (review [16] ). They correspond to two minor Ser isoacceptors with anticodons 5 ' -CmCA-3 ' and 5 ' -NCA-3 ' (N is an unknown modification of U), the latter being complementary to the UGA termination codon. Both of them only read UGA codons, as demonstrated by ribosomal binding assays and by in vitro translation of ,fJ-globin mRNA. In addition, these Ser-tRNAs can be phosphorylated in the presence of a specific kinase, yielding P-Ser-tRNA. These functional peculiarities may be correlated to the unusual structural features of these tRNAs ( [16] and references therein). Sequencing of the gene encoding the opal suppressor Ser-tRNANcA from human, rabbit, chicken and Xenopus has confirmed that the genome of higher eukaryotes encodes authentic suppressor tRNAs.",

Direct involvement in protein synthesis is dependent on the presence of a UGA codon interrupting an 'open' reading frame. Stewart and Sharp [35] have discussed in the following terms the possibility that the opal suppressor tRNA may serve to insert P-Ser into proteins; examining the codon usage for P-Ser residues in a P-Ser-rich protein such as casein (by comparison of the cDNA and protein sequences), they found that all P-Ser are inserted in response to standard Ser codons. However, of the four AGU codons used to specify P-Ser in bovine LYS~ casein, two occur in the sequence AGUGA. Therefore, the authors suggest the interesting possibility that in these two cases the opal suppressor tRNAs would act as frameshifting tRNAs inserting P-Ser in response to an out-of-frame UGA codon overlapping a standard Ser codon [35] . This hypothesis would eliminate the uncomfortable necessity of a UGA codon interrupting an open reading frame, but it assumes that a second frameshift event has to take place downstream of the P-Ser site of insertion in order to recover the, original reading frame. Two recent findings shed new light on potential roles of the opal suppressor tRNAs.",

Se-Cys is cotranslationally incorporated into proteins [38, 39] and it has been shown that the Se-Cys backbone in the glutathione peroxidase arises from Ser [40] . A Se-Cys-specific tRNA has been identified in rat liver [41] but its primary sequence remains to be determined to verify its identity with the opal suppressor tRNAs described above. Meanwhile, one could test whether or not the opal suppressor tRNAs are able to direct Se-Cys insertion at least into mouse glutathione peroxidase. In E. coli a gene whose product is involved in the incorporation of selenium into selenoproteins has just been sequenced [42] . This gene encodes a Ser-tRNA with an anticodon complementary to the UGA termination codon and bears unusual structural features. This finding defines the Se-Cys incorporation pathway: the UGA termination codon is recognized by a natural suppressor tRNA aminoacylated with Ser; a specific enzyme most likely modifies the Ser residue bound to the tRNA into Se-Cys which would then be incorporated into proteins. In conclusion, the UGA codon generally specifies chain termination but it can also be recognized, within the same cell and in some mRNAs only, as encoding Se-Cys. This raises the intriguing question of how the cell distinguishes between these two functions (see section 4).",

The nucleotide sequence of one strain (subgroup B) suggests a strategy of expression of the third class [62] whereas the partial sequence of the protease of another strain (strain AB) seems to indicate a first class type of gene expression [63] . This discrepancy may of course rely on the fact that the sequenced cDNA clone of FeLV (subgroup B) could correspond to a defective RNA [63] .

Recently, it has been shown that yeast Ty transposons (Ty 1-15, Ty 1-17 and Ty 912) also share with retroviruses a common mechanism of gene expression: frameshift appears to be required for the expression of the tyb ORF through the synthesis of a tya-tyb fusion protein [65-671. The tyb ORF overlaps the tya ORF by 38 nt in a + 1 reading frame. Protein tya exhibits structural features characteristic of a DNA-binding protein and protein tyb presents homologies to several reverse transcriptases. Careful Si mapping analyses, able to detect splicing of fragments as short as 5 bp, have definitely excluded the possibility that RNA processing is responsible for the synthesis of the tya-tyb fusion protein. On the contrary, tya-tyb-cxz interferon [65, 67] or tya-tyblac z [65] fusion proteins are expressed exclusively when the reporter genes are in frame with the tyb ORF, leaving frameshift as the only possible mechanism of expression. Deletion studies have brought down to 31 nt the region of overlap in which frameshifting occurs, and within these 3 1 nt there is an 11 nt block that is completely conserved between different classes of transposons [67] . The translational strategy used in transposons for the tya-tyb fusion protein is remarkably similar to that of the retroviral gag-pal polyprotein. Since the tyatyb fusion protein synthesized in vivo is accompanied by a shorter product, presumably a cleavage product [65, 66] , it is reasonable to hypothesize that the tya-tyb moiety also encodes a protease as in retroviruses.",

This genetic organization is once again reminiscent of the gag-pof ORFs of retroviruses. However, attempts to detect a CaMV fusion protein resulting from the suspected frameshift have so far failed. Recent observations indicate that an insertion in the CaMV genome that destroys the overlap between the coat protein and polymerase genes is viable; this suggests that the fusion of the translation products of these two genes is not obligatory [70] . Another non-retroviral-like case should be mentioned: the -1 frameshift occurring in a coronavirus, IBV, for the synthesis of the Fl-F2 fusion protein, presumably encoding the putative viral polymerase [44] .",

In principle, frameshifting could involve decoding of a triplet in another reading frame (implying skipping of one or two but not three nt), non-triplet decoding, non-triplet translocation or some other translational quirk [43, 71, 72] . The data reported above are in favour of another model: a 'slippage model' [52, 55] . The frameshifting tRNA would initially bind to its cognate codon in a standard triplet interaction at the ribosomal A site. Before the peptide bond is formed, a -1 slippage would bring the aminoacyl-tRNA to mispair with the triplet in the -1 reading frame, generating the frameshift. Such a model is based on the assumption that the interaction between the peptidyl-tRNA and its cognate codon is in fact wobbly, so that the third base of the codon at the P site can be read twice, once by its cognate tRNA and once by the frameshifting tRNA. Features that may promote this series of unusual events are discussed below (see section 4.2.1), at the level of both the primary and secondary structure of the mRNA.",

These translational strategies appear to be designed for the synthesis, from one mRNA species and one single initiation event, of two (or more) related proteins differing in their C-terminal region and thus capable of different functions. Moreover, the two or more proteins are produced in different amounts depending on the efficiency of suppression or frameshift. These strategies are essentially encountered in animal and plant viruses. This is not surprising because, due to the relatively small size of their genome, viruses possess an extremely compact genetic organization. Indeed, expression of proteins via nonsense suppression and frameshift fulfills two requirements: maximum exploitation of nucleotide sequence and regulation of protein synthesis. For example, a retrovirus needs both the gag and pol proteins, but whereas the former is required in large amounts, as the precursor of the structural core proteins, the latter is only required in catalytic amounts; thus, a regulated suppression or frameshift mechanism ensures the production of an adequate ratio between the two precursor proteins.

Codon context: primary sequences and secondary structures To explain why some termination codons are suppressible and others not, and also to explain the variable efficiencies of suppression of different termination codons, a major parameter that is generally invoked is 'codon context'. This concept originated from studies on nonsense and missense suppression in prokaryotes (i.e. suppression of mutations leading to the appearance of a termination codon in an ORF or to the replacement of a 'correct' codon by an 'incorrect' one). It appears that translation of a given codon is influenced by the surrounding nucleotides. In particular, the presence of a purine 3' of an amber codon stimulates nonsense suppression in vivo [88-901, suggesting that signals for termination of translation could include sequences downstream of the nonsense codon. This hypothesis is supported by the analysis of the sequences surrounding natural termination codons. The compilation by Kohli and Grosjean [12] of the termination sequences of many eukaryotic and prokaryotic mRNAs reveals a significant bias in the usage of bases at the 3 '-side of termination codons. All tight termination codons in prokaryotes are followed by a U, and all leaky UGA codons are followed by an A [91]. Unfortunately, in eukaryotes no extensive comparison of the contexts of leaky with nonleaky termination codons that includes the cases of viral regulations examined to date has been made. One further observation may still give weight to the hypothesis of codon context in eukaryotes if not exactly to the conclusion drawn by the analysis of the mRNA sequences mentioned above. In three plant RNA viruses (TMV, BNYVV and TYMV) using natural suppression as a translational strategy, the UAG codon is flanked on either side by a CAA (Gln) codon [19, 81, 92] . This may be more than mere coincidence.",

            "text": "If contexts favourable for suppression (and thus unfavourable for termination) do exist, one may also envisage extra signals that could protect cellular termination codons from recognition by endogenous suppressor tRNAs. In this regard, the compilation of termination sequences in eukaryotic cellular mRNAs is deceiving: the frequency of two termination codons in tandem is very low, 60% of the mRNAs having a short ORF of more than 10 triplets downstream of their terminator [12] . However, it still remains that the injection of yeast genetic suppressor tRNAs into Xenopus oocytes has no dramatic consequences, leading only to a very limited number of changes (about 10%) in the two-dimensional pattern of the oocyte proteins [93] . Similarly, mammalian cell lines have been obtained that constitutively express low levels of genetically engineered suppressor tRNAs indicating that cell viability is not affected by the presence of tRNAs recognizing termination codons ( [94] and references therein). These observations all agree with the existence of protective codon contexts in cellular mRNAs, although the identity of such contexts remains undetermined. With the accumulation of viral and non-viral eukaryotic mRNA sequences, it may be possible to discern some pattern among translation termination sequences from which a model for recognition of termination of protein synthesis by RF could emerge. A termination signal might be composed of two domains: a relatively constant region, the nonsense codon, and a variable region, the downstream sequence affecting efficiency of termination [90] . To this speculation is probably related the fact that so far only amber and opal codons have been found to be naturally suppressible. As suggested by Geller and Rich [95] , termination codons may well not be synonymous but the translational machinery may distinguish UAA as absolute termination signal from UAG and UGA as facultative termination codons.",

In principle, all the aminoacyl-tRNAs present in the cell in the form of ternary complexes with elongation factor 1 (EFl: the counterpart of the prokaryotic EF-Tu factor) and GTP are candidates for interacting with the codon at the ribosomal A site. The minimal mechanism of elongation involves two steps. In the first one, called 'substrate selection' [loo] or 'initial recognition' [loll, one of the ternary com-plexes binds to the ribosomal A site and either dissociates or undergoes GTP hydrolysis. In the second step that follows GTP hydrolysis and is called 'proofreading', the aminoacyl-tRNA either is incorporated into the nascent protein chain or falls off the ribosome. Peptide bond formation requires that the EFl-GDP complex has left the ribosome [102]. Thus, three situations are encountered at a given codon: (i) ternary complexes that weakly interact with the ribosome dissociate before GTP hydrolysis; (ii) ternary complexes that stick better to the ribosome, pass the GTP hydrolysis screen but may still dissociate from the ribosome faster than does the EFl-GDP complex; (iii) finally, ternary complexes that stay on the ribosome long enough for GTP hydrolysis and dissociation of the EFl-GDP complex to occur, thus allowing peptide bond formation.

It follows first that crucial determinants of regulation of suppression are the availability and relative amount of tRNA species, natural suppressor tRNAs and RF. Any imbalance in the aminoacyl-tRNA population may favour misreading and nonsense suppression. This is illustrated in the case of MO-MuLV (see section 3.2.1). One may also suggest that the imbalance concerns the concentration of RF by some sequestration mechanism occurring upon viral infection.

Any factor increasing the sticking time of a natural suppressor tRNA on its 'non-cognate' termination codon will increase its probability of participating in peptide chain elongation. Undermodification of bases at the level of the anticodon (see section 3.2.1) as well as codon context are examples of such factors. At least two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the involvement of the bases adjacent to a termination codon in increasing suppression efficiency: the 'swollen codon' hypothesis and the 'tRNA-tRNA interaction' hypothesis [80, 103] . The swollen codon hypothesis suggests a 4 bp or even a 5 bp codon-anticodon interaction; however, this hypothesis appears rather unlikely when considering the conformation of the tRNA loop at the ribosomal A site [ 1041. The second hypothesis suggests that tRNA-tRNA interaction can occur between the peptidyl-tRNA at the P site and the acylated suppressor tRNA at the A site. If favourable, this interaction would counterbalance the weak non-cognate interaction of the natural suppressor tRNA with the termination codon, thereby increasing the sticking time of this tRNA and allowing peptide bond formation.",

Indeed, for a given system and in a given environment, the average time of GTP hydrolysis and of EFl-GDP complex dissociation from the ribosome is very likely constant [loll. Physiological or metabolic variations in the cell may affect these constants. Consequently, the ratios of the sticking times of all ternary complexes to these modified constants are changed. For some ternary complexes this may transform the interaction with the ribosome [99, 101] . For example, let us imagine a metabolic variation leading to more rapid GTP hydrolysis on the ribosome (modification of a GTPase activity, variations in the GTP or GDP concentrations.. .). The average time of GTP hydrolysis is thus shortened and becomes closer to the sticking time of some weakly interacting ternary complexes. Such complexes that would have otherwise been rejected can now pass the 'initial recognition' step. Similarly, changes that accelerate the dissociation of the EFl-GDP complex from the ribosome (mutation or alteration in EFl or in the ribosome.. .) will increase the probability of incorporating non-cognate amino acids into the peptide chain. Thus, both GTP metabolism and EFl recycling appear to play a key role in accuracy and therefore in suppression [98] [99] [100] [101] 105, 106] .",

Hence, frameshifting and nonsense suppression were first observed in the selection of phenotypic reversion of frameshift and nonsense mutations and they presumably occur at low levels in all cellular translations. Of course if these inherent 'errors' of translation were above background level, accuracy of translation would be definitely at stake in any living organism. It seems rather that evolution has optimized the efficiency of these 'errors' at specific sites, turning them into biologically significant sites of regulation.",

Coding regions are not drawn to scale, since ORF and overlaps vary in size among viruses of the same class; only the relative positions of each ORF are highlighted.
