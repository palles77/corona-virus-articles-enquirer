In addition to ML188, ML300 represents the second probe declared for 3CLpro from this collaborative effort. The X-ray structure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro bound with a ML300 analog highlights a unique induced-fit reorganization of the S 2 -S 4 binding pockets leading to the first submicromolar non-covalent 3CLpro inhibitors retaining a single amide bond.",

[1] [2] [3] Identified as the etiological agent responsible for the global pandemic in 2003, SARS presents an atypical pneumonia that during the first major outbreak led to progressive respiratory failure in over 8,000 individuals and about 800 deaths by July of that year. 4 With the cooperation of leading nations, a rigorous public healthcare campaign was fortunately successful in controlling this outbreak. However, a reemergence of the SARS-CoV is considered a potential pandemic risk and new strains of human coronavirus continue to be identified. Since 2003, two additional human coronaviruses, NL63 and HKU1, have been identified in patients and the viruses have been characterized and found to be significantly less lethal than SARS-CoV. [5] [6] [7] Most recently in 2012, a new SARS-like virus, designated the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has been identified in 77 patients so far, 40 of whom died. 8 There is now evidence for person-to-person transmission of MERS-CoV. 9 Now, nearly a decade later, the possibility of another SARS-like pandemic appears even more palpable based upon the lethality and properties of the newly identified MEV-HCoV strain. Effective vaccines and small molecule antiviral agents to prevent or treat SARS-like infections still do not exist, thus tailored antiviral therapies are urgently needed in order to treat potential future outbreaks of SARs and related human coronaviruses.",

            "text": "The SARS and MERS coronaviruses encode two proteases, a papain-like protease (PLpro) and a 3 chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), in their genome that are essential for viral replication. The viral polyprotein is cleaved at 3 unique sites by PLpro and 11 unique sites by 3CLpro. Initial reports of 3CLpro inhibitors in the literature focused on peptidomimetics, often four to five residues in length, bearing a reactive \"warhead\" group, such as an aldehyde, halo-methyl ketone, or Michael acceptor at the terminus with several demonstrating a covalent interaction with the active site Cys-145 residue. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Until recently, the majority of efforts to develop non-peptidic 3CLpro inhibitors also relied on \"warhead\" based design strategies (Fig. 1, 1-5) 17-21 and a number of these non-peptidic inhibitors achieved sub-micromolar activity. In the case of pyridyl ester 4, 20 this potent nanomolar mechanism-based enzyme inactivator led to cell based inhibition below 10 \u00b5M in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells. Recently, we reported N-(tert-butyl)-2-(N-arylamido)-2-(pyridin-3-yl) acetamide 6 ( Fig. 1, ML188 ) and its X-ray complex with 3CLpro (PDB: 3V3M) as a rare example of a non-covalent SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitor of moderate molecular weight with good enzyme and antiviral inhibitory activity. 22 Herein, we describe the continuation of efforts to develop potent, non-covalent SARS-3CLpro inhibitors based upon a second chemical class of triazoles from our MLPCN screening campaign (7, Fig. 2 ) and progression of this lead series to a second generation probe ML300 (8, Fig. 8 ) and beyond to arrive at sub-100 nM inhibitors. We propose from crystallography data that ML300 and related triazoles in this series inhibit 3CLpro via a novel mechanism of action and provide a new direction for additional non-covalent inhibitor design and refinement.",

In addition to the diamide acetamide series represented by ML188 (6, Fig. 1 ), 22 a related diamide series, represented by SID 24808289 (7, Fig. 2) , was identified demonstrating a 3CLpro IC 50 of 6.2 \u00b5M and good selectivity vs. PLpro (IC 50 > 60 \u00b5M) which is used as a control for cysteine-protease activity. Fortunately, quite early in the chemistry campaign an X-ray crystal structure of diamide 7 bound to 3CLpro was determined to 1.85 \u00c5 resolution. A solvent accessible surface depiction of 7 in the 3CLpro active site along with a wall-eye stereo view with key contact resides and hydrogen bonding contacts in depicted in Figure 3 (Fig. 3) . Interestingly, in contrast to the ML188-3CLpro crystal structure in which ML188 accommodates substrate sub-pockets in the enzyme active-site traditionally occupied by peptidomimetics, diamide 7 engenders an induced-fit complex resulting in a new surface dictated largely by a rearrangement of the Gln-189 and Met-49 residue side-chains. 23 This induced fit accommodates the syn N-methyl pyrrole and anilido acetamide moieties of the inhibitor within subpockets that can be characterized as S 2 -S 4 and S 2 -S 1 , subpockets, respectively. Figure 2 schematically illustrates the inhibitor-active site interactions oriented in a manner similar as depicted in Figure 3 . In addition to the P 2 -P 4 and P 2 -P 1 , groups the inhibitor partially occupies the S 3 subpocket with a terminating 2-methylbutylamide. Key hydrogen bonding interactions can be found near the catalytic site with His-163 and the benzotriazole N-(3) engaged in a key interaction, with an interatomic distance of 2.9 \u00c5. In addition a backbone Glu-166 NH interaction is evident with the central acetamide oxygen (N-O distance 2.8 \u00c5).",

Since the N-(3) nitrogen of 7 appeared to be involved in a hydrogen bond with His-163, it was somewhat surprising that 9a was not tolerated since the imidazole has the potential to maintain a N-(3)-His-163 hydrogen bond interaction. However, within the 3CLpro-7 structure the catalytic Cys-145 residue is located within 3.3 \u00c5 of the N- (2) nitrogen, indicating potential for a weak hydrogen bond and/or dipole-dipole stabilization interaction. This potential interaction may perhaps be responsible for the 1,2,3-triazole preference.

Relative to probe ML188 (6) and the equipotent diamide 13d, ML300 proved to offer improvements in several areas (Fig. 6) . SARS 3CLpro inhibitor ML300 is 100 amu lower MW (MW=431) relative to 13d with moderate ligand efficiency (LE). Deletion of the lipophilic P 3 group reduces cLogP an order of magnitude (cLogP=3.2) and thus greatly improves ligand-efficiency-dependent lipophilicity (LELP) versus ML188 and 13d. Probe molecules ML188 and ML300 were evaluated in an in-house 25 in vitro DMPK panel including plasma protein binding, P450 enzyme inhibition, and intrinsic clearance using liver microsomes (Fig. 6) . Both ML188 and ML300 possess good free fraction with ML300 being superior (1.5 and 4.0-fold improved human and rat fraction unbound, respectively); however, intrinsic clearance (CL HEP normalized to liver blood flow, Q h = 21 mL/min/kg, Q r = 70 mL/min/kg) indicates ML188 and both ML300 are predicted to be highly cleared. ML188 and ML300 possess modest P450 enzyme inhibition, with ML300 maintaining 5-10 \u00b5M activity across four major CYP enzymes (Fig. 6) . Probe ML300 was found to be highly selective in a Eurofins lead-profiling screen 26 with only modest activity for melatonin MT 1 receptor in a radioligand binding assay.",

            "text": "Based on the absence of key hydrogen bonding interactions of the P 2 -P 1 , amide of 7 with the 3CLpro active site, in addition to the poor metabolic instability and CYP profile of ML300, we opted to explore more diverse amide replacements as a means to improve metabolic stability, P450 activity, and 3CLpro inhibitory potency. Initial efforts identified representative N-methyl (16j) and N-benzyl (16k) anilines with potency comparable to probe ML300 (16e). The lack of activity for benzamide 16h versus the reduced benzylamine 16k is striking and indicates the enhanced flexibility of the N-benzyl group is permitting a productive interaction to occur where previously aromatic amides were not tolerated (see Fig. 5, 13i-j) . A subsequent survey of biaryls was explored (Table 1 17a-e) and on the basis of the 3CLpro-7 X-ray we targeted 3-pyridyl (17b-c) and 4-pyrimidyl (17e) heterocycles as means to potentially engage a side-chain interaction from the hydroxyl groups of Thr-24 or Thr-25. These modifications afforded inhibitors with micromolar activity and in the case of 2-methoxypyridyl 17c submicromolar activity (IC 50 = 700 nM). Unexpectedly the parent simple phenyl biaryl 17a proved to have a major impact on activity with a ~7-10-fold increase relative to 17b-c. 3CLpro inhibitor 17a represented the first sub-100 nM inhibitor for the series and to our knowledge one of the most potent non-warhead based SARS 3CLpro inhibitors to date. At this time inhibitor 17a is relatively unoptimized and thus current efforts are focused on targeted biaryl congeners to understand DMPK, cellular activity, as well as potential broad spectrum activity against other coronavirus strains including MERS-CoV.",

The X-ray crystal structure of HTS hit 7 bound to 3CLpro 27 was instrumental in guiding optimization and the induced-fit of this inhibitor 3CLpro complex illustrates the challenges of divergent SAR and the limitations of virtual based screens. The four component Ugi reaction was utilized once more to rapidly generate SAR for the putative P 2 -P 1 , and P 1 subgroups. Importantly, P 3 truncation was possible for this triazole series of 3CLpro inhibitors, allowing for significant MW reduction without diminishing potency. Collaborative efforts in these laboratories continue towards the identification active inhibitors within the truncated biaryl class. Integrated efforts with DMPK assessment continue in order to improve intrinsic clearance and diminish P450 activity, which are issues to be addressed within the series prior to in vivo proof-of-mechanism studies.
