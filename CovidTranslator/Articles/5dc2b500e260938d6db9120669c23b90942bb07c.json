Influenza vaccination coverage amongst GPs in Australia was 50% in 1998. 16 In neighbouring New Zealand, coverage amongst GPs was 68% and 64% in PNs in 2001. 17 Other countries have reported lower coverage estimates, with only 35% of Canadian family physicians from Qu\u00e9bec 18 and 36% of GPs from the Netherlands 19 vaccinated in 1996 and 2008, respectively. A study across all primary health care professions in Israel reported an average of 30% coverage across physicians, nurses, pharmacists and administration staff. 20 Factors associated with influenza vaccination status have been examined in primary health care clinicians in other countries. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Amongst this group of HCW's, significant predictors for vaccine acceptance include the following: agreement that HCW's have professional responsibility to be vaccinated, on-site access to free vaccine, workplace recommendation for staff influenza vaccination, desire for self-protection and belief that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risk of vaccine side effects. 17, 21 Furthermore, previous influenza vaccination has been significantly associated with current vaccine acceptance in both hospital HCWs and primary care physicians. 20 Factors significantly associated with lack of vaccine acceptance include the following: no medical indication for vaccination, belief that regular medical exposure will protect against the disease, low risk of contracting influenza, fear of vaccine side effects and lack of time or priority. 17, 19, 20 Some of these factors are similar to those cited by hospital HCWs whilst others differ. In a review of attitudes and predictors to influenza vaccination of hospital HCW's, lack of convenient access to vaccine and poor knowledge about influenza infection were prominent reasons for lack of vaccination with the desire for self-protection and belief in the vaccine's effectiveness the most prominent reasons for vaccine acceptance in this group. 22 To the best of our knowledge, there have been limited studies which specifically examine: influenza vaccination coverage, workplace provision of vaccination, knowledge, attitudes and personal barriers to influenza vaccination amongst GPs and PNs in Australia. The aim of this study therefore was to contribute to the limited literature base in this important area by investigating this in the primary health care setting in NSW, Australia.",

It also posed questions intended to determine the respondent's attitude towards vaccination, based on seven statements about efficacy, safety, adverse events and recommended target groups for influenza vaccine and was part of a wider survey that incorporated questions on pandemic influenza.

Comparing vaccine uptake between the studies for both GPs and PNs in NSW only, the AGPN study reported slightly lower coverage (5%) across both years in both groups. 23 As data was collected at a practice level in the AGPN study, individual vaccination status may have been incorrectly reported and may be underestimating the actual coverage rate. However, our results may overestimate actual coverage because of a number of reasons including the low response rate and use of self-reported vaccination status. Studies into GP influenza vaccination coverage have been performed in other countries. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] 30 Cowen et al. 21 in the United States (US) had a similar response rate to our study (30% versus 38%), but reported a much higher vaccination coverage rate for US family physicians (84%).

The wording of the question may have impacted on the result, as respondents could have taken it to mean for GPs in general and not for them personally. However, it is interesting to note, of the GPs who said their practice does not provide free vaccine, 40% stated that paying for the vaccine was a barrier to receiving it. Further qualitative research would assist in addressing these gaps in understanding.",

            "text": "The GPs and PNs in our study largely disagreed with the common vaccination myths presented in the survey (see Table 3 ). In contrast, the most frequently reported reason amongst Dutch GPs for not being vaccinated was having no medical indication for influenza vaccination 19 and in Israel; physicians were much less frequently influenced by the fear that vaccination would cause influenza when compared to other practice staff. 20 There was almost no consistency of agreement with both these misconceptions in our sample or that of Litt et al., 16 who found that the main reasons indicated by Australian GPs for being vaccinated against influenza were concern about getting influenza or its complications and to prevent having time off work because of influenza. Live viruses in the influenza vaccine was the most common myth supported by respondents (21AE6%, 30 \u2044 139) yet a decade ago, less than 4% of Australian GPs gave this as a reason for not getting influenza vaccine. 16 The reasons behind this shift in belief is unknown; however, technology could play a part, with increased access to a variety of information sources. In the light of this, GP education should continue to focus on dispelling this myth through use of evidence-based information. Other barriers to influenza vaccination identified in our study were lack of awareness of any recommendations for general practice staff to receive the influenza vaccine (10%) and unacceptable side effects of vaccination (7%). These are similar to those commonly cited by HCWs in other countries. [19] [20] [21] For hospital doctors, being too busy has been identified as a major barrier to getting vaccinated against influenza. 6, 12, 24 In contrast, only a small number of participants, all of whom were GPs, identified lack of time as a barrier as did approximately 25% of GP respondents the Australian Influenza and Pneumococcal Vaccination Survey (2003) in the elderly. 16 A previous investigation of general practice staff across 53 DGPs in Australia found a significant association between workplace influenza vaccination policy and staff vaccination. 23 We found that interrelationship between staff beliefs and practice policies may be an important determinant of HCW immunization behaviours in these practices. Office policies demanding immunisation and operating within an effective hierarchy can lead staff members to re-evaluate their beliefs about influenza immunization in the light of their own experience. 31 Continued efforts at the practice level to make formal commitments to staff health by developing policies for influenza vaccination of staff may assist in increasing coverage in this group. Provision of the influenza vaccine to patients along with consistent, direct, exposure to influenza like illness by this population 32 may further impact on their decision to be vaccinated. Pandemic (H1N1) Influenza 2009 is also likely to increase awareness of influenza vaccination and instigate new policies and practices surrounding vaccination of primary health care staff as has been seen in other countries during heightened awareness of an impending influenza pandemic threat. 33 There are a number of limitations to this study including sample size, generalisability and use of self-report for vaccination status. Although the sample size was small, compared to other general practice-based surveys, it would be considered reasonable in the light of the challenges with surveying this population. 34, 35 There is potential for selection bias in this study towards those who are particularly concerned about influenza and \u2044 or vaccination or those who accept vaccination. Furthermore, using self-reported vaccination status in adults has been shown to overestimate coverage. 36, 37 There may also be limitations with generalisability because our study was conducted only in one state of Australia. This study did not collect any data on nonrespondents or outcomes for those who intended to be vaccinated in 2009. In addition, the barriers in our survey may not have covered all possible options, thus may have influenced participants response. Qualitative research is needed to further explore these findings.",

Understanding barriers to vaccination is the first step to developing effective strategies to overcome them. For institution-based HCWs, there is now an extensive literature base around knowledge, attitudes and practices towards influenza vaccination, whereas, there are only a few studies exploring these topics in the primary health care setting in Australia. To enhance development and targeting of strategies to increase coverage, a more complete and current understanding of coverage in this group is needed to build on the estimates presented here. We believe this study to be a basis for future investigations and interventions to increase influenza vaccination rates in primary health care staff in Australia.",
