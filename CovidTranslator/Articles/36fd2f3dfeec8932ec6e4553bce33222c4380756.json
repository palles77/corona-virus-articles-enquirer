            "text": "We describe a Multiplex Primer Prediction (MPP) algorithm to build multiplex compatible primer sets to amplify all members of large, diverse and unalignable sets of target sequences. The MPP algorithm is scalable to larger target sets than other available software, and it does not require a multiple sequence alignment. We applied it to questions in viral detection, and demonstrated that there are no universally conserved priming sequences among viruses and that it could require an unfeasibly large number of primers ($3700 18-mers or $2000 10-mers) to generate amplicons from all sequenced viruses. We then designed primer sets separately for each viral family, and for several diverse species such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) segments of influenza A virus, Norwalk virus, and HIV-1. We empirically demonstrated the application of the software with a multiplex set of 16 short (10 nt) primers designed to amplify the Poxviridae family to produce a specific amplicon from vaccinia virus.",

            "text": "Researchers employ numerous approaches for viral detection and discovery, including metagenomic sequencing (1) (2) (3) , microarrays (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) or multiplex PCR followed by other methods of characterization such as mass spectrometry (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) , suspension arrays (15, 16) or amplicon sequencing (17) . Multiplex PCR followed by analysis of amplified products fills a niche for viral identification when singleplex PCR has failed or there are a few dozen likely candidates but the expense of metagenomic sequencing or high-density microarrays is unwarranted (18) . However, multiplex primer design for many highly divergent targets is challenging since no universally conserved primers may exist, and finding sets of primers likely to function well in multiplex (e.g. isothermal T m 's, no primer dimers) adds to the complexity of finding conserved primer candidates. Primer design software that requires a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) as input can be problematic for diverse target sets, as MSAs can be difficult to construct, exhausting memory or available time before an alignment is completed. Even if an alignment does complete for divergent target sets such as all members of a family of RNA viruses or gene homologues across species, alignments may show little nucleotide sequence conservation, and multiple primers are required to amplify all targets. Considering the challenges of primer design for targets showing sequence variation, it is not surprising that many of the PCR-based assays in the literature are predicted to fail to detect desired targets when compared against available sequence data, and this problem is worst at higher taxonomic levels like family (19) .",

None of those tools build multiplex sets in which no primers in the set are predicted to form primer-dimers, although some avoid homodimers. We attempted to run a number of alternative software tools for multiplex or degenerate primer prediction for several species level target sets ranging in size from 41 to $6000 sequences: Primaclade (24) , FastPCR (www .biocenter.helsinki.fi/bi/programs/fastpcr.htm), GeneUp (25) , PDA-MS/UniQ software (26) , Greene SCPrimer (20) and HYDEN (22) . Only Greene SCPrimer and HYDEN could handle the two smallest, species-level target sets (Norwalk virus and FMDV), and none of the tools completed for the larger target sets that we attempted to run. Therefore, we designed the MPP software to avoid the requirement of an MSA and to scale better for large and diverse target sets. MPP builds a multiplex-compatible set of primers capable of amplifying all target sequences, attempting to minimize the number primers in the set.",

Throughout, we use the term 'detected' to mean that there should be at least one PCR product. This is a loose definition of 'detected' adopted for convenience in the following discussions, and we recognize that a PCR product may prove insufficient for viral characterization. We predicted a set of 'universal viral primers' for all available complete genomes of all viruses, and found that the number of universal viral primers would be impractical to implement, even if short, highly conserved priming sequences were used. Then we predicted family-level primer sets for every viral family, as well as for several highly diverse species of RNA viruses, for primers of a traditional length as well as nontraditional, shorter, more highly conserved primers, which are more likely to amplify novel, unsequenced viruses and which could be an alternative to degenerate primers. While the software uses a greedy algorithm that may settle at a local minimum which is above the true minimal set, it generated primer sets for each viral family with fewer than half the number of primers that would be expected without optimization. Although family-level primer sets for some families are too large to be practical, 64% of the families had primer sets of no more than 20 primer pairs, quite feasible for multiplex PCR.",

First, we enumerate all candidate oligos fitting user-specified requirements for length, T m , and lack of hairpin formation. We rank pairs of these by the number of targets in which that pair occurs within a distance range d 1 bases to d 2 bases of one another, where these might be specified so as to bound a reasonable range for a downstream characterization method such electrophoretic discrimination of bands, probe hybridization or sequencing. The most frequent pair is selected as primers. The process is repeated for the remaining targets that would not have an amplicon from the first pair, with the added consideration that new primers selected be predicted not to form dimers with other primers already selected, as well as can be predicted based on nearest neighbor thermodynamic predictions (27) , although free energy calculations cannot predict with certainty that primer dimers will be excluded in practice. There is an option to bin primers into reaction subsets, if desired. With binning, primers are added to a bin until that bin contains b primers, at which point a new bin is begun, following the same process. Binning primers in smaller groups avoids exclusion of the most highly conserved oligos because of primer dimer free energy constraints. The universal set of primers is the set of selected primers to amplify all genomes in the target set. The primers within a bin should be multiplexed into a single PCR reaction, but each bin should be run separately. This is a simple binning strategy, and alternative strategies could be employed such as starting a new bin with any primer pair that dimerizes with other previously selected primers regardless of the number of primers in the bin, but this could have the possible disadvantage of bin explosion to numerous singleplex or small multiplex reactions. The graph-based algorithm of MuPlex (28, 29) is another binning strategy that could be incorporated. Output on the number of primers rejected due to the various filters (T m , hairpin free energy, etc.) is printed to standard output after each round of primer pairs are selected and also cumulatively, so a user can monitor if/which parameters might be too stringent. If an alternative set of primers is desired that does not overlap with the set selected, one can replace with N's the subsequences matching the selected primers and their reverse complements in the target sequences and rerun the software with the modified input sequences.",

MPP eliminates oligos with N's from consideration as primers. This approach is simple, although it risks being overly strict by eliminating some potentially successful candidate primers, since it disallows those cases where a single nonunique primer pairs with a unique primer, a pair of nonunique primers are too far apart to actually generate an amplicon in a nontarget sequence, or candidate oligos partially overlap a nonunique stretch of N's.",

For the HIV-1 and influenza A segments HA and NA, MUSCLE ran out of memory before completing. An alternative alignment tool, ClustalW (31), had completed only a small fraction of the alignment after running for days. Therefore, for these large data sets, a random selection of $35 sequences for each target was aligned with MUSCLE, and this alignment was used to build a profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (hmmbuild) using HMMer (http://hmmer.wustl.edu/). (32) The full sequence set was then aligned to the HMM using hmmalign. For Norwalk virus and FMDV, we designed multiplex-degenerate primer sets using GreeneSCPrimer (20) and HYDEN (22) , but the other three targets sets were too large for those programs.

We chose the Poxviridae family multiplex for these first empirical demonstrations because extracted viral nucleic acid was readily available for experiments. All primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA, USA) and resuspended to 100 mM stock solutions in TE buffer (pH 8.0, Teknova, Hollister, CA, USA). Working solutions containing equimolar concentrations of each of the 16 primers were used in all experiments. Purified, quantitated vaccinia Lister strain DNA was purchased at a concentration of 1.3 \u00c2 10 4 copies/ml in nuclease-free water from Advanced Biotechnologies, Inc. (Columbia, MD, USA). All PCR experiments were prepared using the Superscript III RT-PCR kit from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). We selected the RT-PCR kit in order to establish a protocol that could later be readily applied to additional multiplex viral family reactions with viral DNA and/or RNA. Each 25 ml reaction contained 1 \u00c2 SSIII buffer, 1 U of SSIII RT/ Taq enzyme, 4.8 mM MgSO 4 , 0.1 mM each primer, and a viral template mass of 2.7 pg ($10 4 copies). Tests were performed in triplicate and corresponding negative controls were run under identical conditions except that viral template was replaced with nuclease-free water (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). All reactions were thermocycled on the Bio-Rad DNA Engine (Hercules, CA, USA) as follows: one cycle of 2 min at 94 C; 40 cycles of 15 s at 94 C, 30 s at 43.9 C, 1 min at 68 C; one cycle of 5 min at 68 C. In line with our goal to create a protocol applicable to both DNA and/or RNA templates, we verified that inclusion of an RT step (one cycle of 30 min at 45 C) does not alter the outcome of the subsequent PCR when working with DNA template (data not shown). As such, for all Poxviridae 16-plex results reported here, an RT step was not used. Another goal was to establish reaction conditions that can be applied to any multiplex viral primer set without the need for re-optimization, assuming the primer set is designed with the same general parameter contraints (T m s, etc.) used to compute the 16-plex presented here. As such, we first optimized master mix conditions, where it was determined that a 4.8 mM MgSO 4 concentration resulted in most optimal amplification. Similarly, we determined the optimal annealing temperature based on results from annealing temperature gradient experiments. A more detailed discussion on the optimization of reaction conditions for amplification with our short primer viral multiplexes is the subject of a separate paper in preparation (Hiddessen and co-workers).",

Figure 2 also shows that removing all T m constraints allows fewer primers to be used since no conserved primers are eliminated due to T m , as some AT rich subsequences tend to be fairly conserved. Figure 3 shows that a universal primer set predicted using the 2004 sequence data would amplify only 35% of the 2007 sequences using primers of at least 10 nt in length.

The most diverse families, in particular Bunyaviridae, Geminiviridae, Polydnaviridae, Reoviridae, Retroviridae, Siphoviridae and Orthomyxoviridae require so many primers that actually applying family-level amplification is probably infeasible.

Influenza A HA and NA segments demand large numbers of 10-mer or 17-18-mer primers and hours to calculate, so one could break these into subgroups, possibly by serotype, as shown for several HA serotypes in Table 3 . The percentage of genomes amplified versus the number of primers used, for primers of either 10-mers or 17-18-mers, is shown in Figure 6 . This plot shows that a large fraction of targets are amplified with only 2 primers, and the addition of subsequent primers shows diminishing returns in amplifying fewer, more divergent targets not detected by the initial, more conserved, primer pair, although the true diminishing returns depend on the extent to which available sequence data is an unbiased representation of diversity. The more traditional method of attempting to find primers from a MSA would be problematic, probably requiring manually designed primer multiplexes or highly degenerate primers. GAAGAAGCG starting at 9071. These regions are too far apart to be used as primers for most polymerases used in diagnostic PCR protocols, where amplicons must typically be less than 300 bases long for efficient amplification. A recently published study (35) selected primers from the 5 0 LTR U5 end to the Gag-Pol start (5 0 -TAGC AGTGGCGCCCGA-3 0 and 5 0 -TCTCTCTCCTTCTAGC CTCCGC-3 0 ), but a comparison against available genomic data indicates that 487 of the 1175 genomes (41%) do not contain a sequence match for this primer pair, so may fail to be amplified. For influenza A segment HA, the size of the longest conserved region from the 95% consensus is only 5 bases, and for segment NA, only 6 bases, insufficient for even a single primer. For FMDV and Norwalk virus, the longest 100% conserved regions are 9 and 6 bases, respectively.

Since testing all possible pairwise oligonucleotide combinations against each target explodes in time and memory for large target sets, a cap on the maximum number of candidate primers to be tested must be imposed, presumably using the most common oligos, although this is not explicit in the paper. Then a Grey shaded entries indicate where calculations were not run to completion. In other cases (not shaded) where fewer than 100% of targets were predicted to be amplified, the algorithm failed to find primer pairs that met all the required specifications for the remaining targets, that is, primers in the right length, T m , and amplicon length range, with hairpin and dimer avoidance with other primers already selected to be in the set, could not be found. None of the calculations that completed required more than the 16 GB of RAM that was available. PCR simulation (performing a text search for the primer in the target sequence) of each pair versus each target is performed. Unfortunately, the most common oligos may not occur in the correct orientation or distance to serve as primer pairs, so that multiple iterations of the entire process must be performed before a set covering all targets is obtained. MPP, in contrast, uses an efficient ranking algorithm to favor pairs of primer candidates that will produce amplicons of the right size in the most targets. Because of the MPP hashing algorithm and data structures, those targets that are amplified is easily determined without simulating PCR. A copy of the GeneUp software for testing could not be obtained from the authors. The PDA-MS/UniQ approach (26) uses a hash index of 4-mers and scoring heuristic to identify common regions in the target sequences with the most shared tetramers. Simulating combinations of candidate primers selected from these common regions is then performed using a genetic algorithm. Their genetic algorithm is a more scalable approach than those above, and the quality of the solution may be improved with more compute power, although a potential disadvantage of genetic algorithms is that they can be slow, particularly if there are very many possible combinations. For computational tractability, they limited primer size to 12 nt, and avoidance of hairpins and primer dimers was not modeled. This software was not available for download or on a public web server. The other software all required MSA as input. While these tools could not be tested on larger (e.g. family level) primer prediction problems where alignments would not be possible or appropriate, we nevertheless attempted to run these tools on the alignable species-level target sets. The Primaclade (24) webserver timed out for the smallest alignments we tested, Norwalk and FMDV.

HYDEN (22) also generated degenerate candidates from a MSA, although it does not check T m and the length is limited to a single value rather than a range. For our tests using HYDEN, we used a length of 18 rather than 17 because of the lack of T m control, and allowed 0 mismatches. The GreeneSCPrimer option requiring the fewest total primers for the Norwalk set required 18 primers, four of which had either 2-fold or 4-fold degeneracy so the actual number of priming sequences would be 26, compared to a total of 20 non-degenerate primers predicted by MPP (Supplementary Data). HYDEN generated four degenerate primers covering only 34 of 41 sequences, each with 3-or 4-fold degeneracy for Norwalk, which translates to 15 priming sequences in the reaction. One would need to find primers to amplify the remaining seven sequences. Small degenerate priming sets (e.g. four primers in this case) are less expensive to purchase, but because of dilution effects from the many sequence combinations actually present (15 priming sequences in the PCR), sensitivity may be reduced compared to nondegenerate priming. However, using a smaller set of degenerate signatures such as those from HYDEN may be preferable, and is a capability that could improve MPP in a future version.",

            "text": "In some applications, such as clinical or biodetection applications, the exogenous nucleic acids from other eukaryotic sources, notably human sources, may be present in varying and unknown concentrations. To test the effects of background human genomic DNA on the performance (amplification specificity) of the Poxviridae 16-plex primer set, we conducted PCR reactions across a series of mass ratios of vaccinia Lister DNA:human genomic DNA at 1 : 1, 10 : 1, 100 : 1, 1000 : 1 and 10000 : 1. These correspond to approximate copy number ratios of vaccinia : human genomes of 1.3 \u00c2 10 4 : 0.82, 1.3 \u00c2 10 4 : 0.082, 1.3 \u00c2 10 4 : 0.0082, 1.3 \u00c2 10 4 : 0.00082 and 1.3 \u00c2 10 4 : 0.000082, using genome sizes of 1.9 \u00c2 10 5 bp and 3 \u00c2 10 9 bp for vaccinia and human DNA, respectively. For context, there are 6.58 pg or two copies of the genome in one human cell. Our algorithm predicted 233 amplicons between 50 and 1000 bp from the human genome. In experiments, this would appear as a 'smear' on the agarose gel, which indeed was observed for the mass ratios of 1 : 1 and 10 : 1 (Figure 7 , lanes 6 and 7, respectively). However, even at a ratio of 10 : 1 vaccinia:human DNA (lane 7), the 617-bp vaccinia amplicon is clearly visible on the gel, despite the numerous nonspecific amplicons. At ratios of 100 : 1, 1000 : 1 and 10000 : 1 (lanes 8, 9 and 10, respectively, Figure 7) , the smear is drastically reduced to nonexistent (at the resolution of the agarose gel), and the vaccinia amplicon is readily visible. For comparison, we tested the 16-plex primers against the same mass of human DNA in the absence of vaccinia DNA at 2.7 pg (the 1 : 1 ratio mass), 0.027 pg (100 : 1 mass) and 2.7 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 pg (10000 : 1 mass) (lanes 12, 13, and 14, respectively, Figure 7) . The data show a similar smear at 2.7 pg as was observed when vaccinia DNA was present (lane 6). However, the low-intensity 617-bp amplicon from vaccinia is visible in lane 6 (with vaccinia) while a similar amplicon is not present in lane 12 (without vaccina). These results provide evidence that amplification with these family level primer sets will depend on viral titers in the actual sample, and that there are cases where amplification will either not be possible or require additional sample purification steps. However, as discussed further in the next section, specific amplification with a short-primer multiplex could be used for selective enrichment of viral targets by generating amplicons with known sequence, which may be feasible for viral detection if combined with a probebased amplicon detection method such as TaqMan \u00d5 or Luminex bead based suspension arrays (http://www .luminexcorp.com/). We compared recently published conserved Orthopoxvirus primers (36) to the 148 Poxviridae genomes, and computational predictions suggest that 67 of the available genomes might not be amplified by the two primers they designed for the Orthopox genus. These included a number of monkeypox, ectromelia, several vaccinia and a couple of variola strains. However, in permissive hybridization conditions it is possible that primers would anneal despite mismatches to target, allowing more of the targets to be amplified. Four conserved Orthopoxvirus primers from an earlier publication (37) , before many of the Poxviridae genomes were available, do not match 53 genomes, including a number of monkeypox, ectromelia, camelpox and one variola minor genome. The primers in (37) included inosine bases, which we replaced with each possible A, T, G and C base in all possible combinations for our primer-target comparison. Thus, published Orthopoxvirus primers may fail to amplify many desired targets.",

This is an NP complete problem (38) , so an exhaustive search for the global optimum is only practical for very small target sets. It is also beyond the scope of the current software to predict priming with mismatches between target and primer, which may occur under nonstringent hybridization conditions or for mismatches at the 5 0 end of a primer. While allowing for such priming would reduce the number of primers needed to amplify all targets, it would substantially slow the algorithm and increase memory requirements. Nor do we claim to have taken all steps to optimize (e.g. through parallelization, see Supplementary Methods) for speed or memory, but instead present this software as a simple embodiment of one alternative to MSA for multiplex primer design.",

For many target sets, such as those including all the genomes of a species, predicting a universal primer set requires only minutes up to a few hours, although for inputs with thousands of sequences a run may take days. We used MPP to design a universal primer set for a target set of all virus genomes, and showed that even if short primers are used, thousands of priming sequences would be required to amplify all sequenced viruses. We then applied MPP to design multiplex family level primers for every viral family, as well as for some diverse species target sets too large for other available primer prediction software.",

The user can specify an appropriate product length range to ensure amplification of an adequate span across the gene. MPP could also be used to design multiplex primer sets for unrelated target sequences, for example, multiple bacterial and viral species or gene families, in a single reaction. Since no sequence alignment is required, there is no need for any sequence conservation among targets. Recent work showed that a large-scale multiplex of 800 primer pairs specifically designed to detect a diverse set of genes from nine pathogens improved sensitivity on a microarray by up to 1000-fold (39) . The MPP software could be used to design multiplex primer sets for similar work.",

            "text": "We demonstrated the application of the algorithm experimentally using purified vaccinia DNA, amplifying the expected band with a Poxviridae short primer multiplex PCR, and confirmed the band's expected sequence. We provided an example of the effect of background nucleic acids by spiking human DNA into the PCR reaction over a series of mass ratios. While a band for vaccinia was visualized by slab gel electrophoresis for all mass ratios, background DNA smears were also clear at the higher ratios. At a mass ratio of 1 : 1 vaccinia:human DNA, there are 2.7 pg or 0.82 copies of the human genome present in the reaction. To place this into context, there are $6.58 pg or two copies of genomic DNA in one human cell. Thus, the results from the 1 : 1 mass ratio reaction represents the impact that $41% of the total DNA content from one human cell could have on the results, when analyzed by slab gel electrophoresis. In a clinical sample, there could be a much greater number of human cells and DNA. Amplification with these family level primer sets will depend on viral titers in the actual sample, and these experiments show that there are cases where amplification will either not be possible or require additional sample purification steps. While short primer PCR multiplexes may enable amplification of diverse target sets, they will not match the specificity of longer primers. Combination of these short primer multiplexes with digitized, microfluidic-based picoliter reactions (40) and/or next-generation microfluidic-based sample purification technologies that have the ability to isolate target from contaminating nucleic acids may help to overcome this limitation. However, even in the absence of such technologies, a highly conserved short primer multiplex could enrich amplification products for members of a particular viral family compared to randomly amplified or unamplified sample. Then it would need to be followed by product sequencing or array hybridization, such as TaqMan \u00d5 or Luminex bead-based suspension arrays (http://www.luminexcorp.com/), to provide more specific information about the organism(s) present, since electrophoretic banding patterns may contain unexpected bands, particularly if the sample contains a significant amount of nonviral nucleic acids.",

            "text": "Previous studies have shown the utility of short primer singleplex PCR using 9-mers or 10-mers followed by gel electrophoresis for genetic fingerprinting of eukaryotes and bacteria (41, 42) . For viruses, with much smaller and more diverse genomes, the large numbers of 9-mer or 10-mer primers required to generate at least one band from every virus as predicted by our analyses implies that primer size would need to be as short as 5-mers to rely on a gel banding pattern using only one priming sequence for fingerprinting viruses (unpublished data). However, the analyses here predict that imperfect sample purification to eliminate eukaryotic nucleic acids could be problematic for universal viral priming using primers shorter than 15 bases, particularly for multiplexes of 10 or more primers. Nanda et al. (43, 44) were able to achieve sufficient viral isolation from cell culture samples to allow viral identification using viral PCR with priming sequences as short as pentamers, so the problem of contaminating host nucleic acids for specific, short primer PCR of viruses is not insurmountable. They found specific pentamer PCR to be several logs more sensitive than nonspecific amplification, provided that they purified encapsidated viral nucleic acids prior to PCR. Another method that has been used for virus discovery is VIDISCA (Virus discovery cDNA-AFLP) using restriction enzyme digestion, adaptor ligation, and PCR by priming with the adaptor sequence (45, 46) . This method, like the pentamer priming used by (43, 44) , requires prior separation of encapsidated viral nucleic acids, as it generates fragments from any DNA present, viral, host or otherwise. Multiplex PCR with primers 10-15 nt in length may be yet another alternative strategy lying between these nonspecific methods and PCR with standard primers of at least 18 nt, as we have shown that it can add some measure of specificity for a viral family.",
