Cytokines were the most strongly induced genes, but the inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 were not required for protection. Lung-expressed antimicrobial peptides were also highly up-regulated.

Keywords: innate immunity; pneumonia; immunocompromised host; lung epithelium Among both healthy and immunosuppressed people, pneumonia is the leading cause of premature death in the world (1) (2) (3) . Nosocomial pneumonias result in more deaths than any other hospital infection (4) , and impose a particular burden on immunocompromised patients, such as those with hematologic malignancies and others undergoing cytotoxic therapies (5) (6) (7) . The lower respiratory tract is also a frequent locus of emerging infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (8) or epidemic influenza (9) , and of difficult to manage pathogens, such as multiple drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa or extensively drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Furthermore, the respiratory route is the most likely portal of entry for bioterror agents, and the only means by which such pathogens have been delivered successfully in the modern era (i.e., inhalation anthrax) (10, 11) .",

            "text": "Although the need for gas exchange leaves the lungs structurally vulnerable to infection, they successfully contain and eliminate most pathogens. The airway and alveolar epithelia, in particular, are critical to the prevention of infection through their capacity to recruit leukocytes and to initiate antimicrobial innate immune responses (12) (13) (14) (15) . We have recently found that stimulation of lung innate immune mechanisms with an aerosolized bacterial lysate confers a high level of protection against challenge with otherwise lethal inocula of Streptococcus pneumoniae (16) . Pretreatment with the lysate induces complete protection against challenge if given 4 to 24 hours before challenge. Lesser levels of protection occur at shorter and longer intervals between treatment and challenge, and some protection occurs even when treatment follows challenge. Protection does not depend on recruited neutrophils or resident mast cells and alveolar macrophages, and is specific to the airway route of infection. The survival benefit correlates in magnitude and time with rapid bacterial killing within the lungs, and is associated with increased concentrations of numerous antimicrobial polypeptides in lung lining fluid. We have termed the protective phenomenon, stimulated innate resistance (StIR).",

Because of the characteristic breadth of innate immunity, and the complexity of the lysate used to stimulate protection against S. pneumoniae, the survival effect induced by the aerosolized bacterial lysate might be expected to extend to other bacterial pathogens, or even to other microbial classes. Here, we tested this hypothesis by treating mice with the lysate before challenge with numerous respiratory pathogens, including nosocomial pathogens and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases class A bioterror agents. We find dramatic protection against diverse bacterial and fungal pathogens, and that this effect appears to arise from the simultaneous induction of multiple antimicrobial pathways in the epithelium. These findings could provide a basis for novel clinical strategies to protect immunosuppressed patients from fatal infectious complications, and to safeguard broader populations from emerging infections or bioterror assaults.",

Intranasal instillation of 5 3 LD 50 B. anthracis Ames strain spores caused 100% mortality in mice that did not receive NTHi lysate pretreatment, but ,20% mortality in pretreated mice ( Figure  1D , left). Protection was associated with a significant reduction in lung bacterial CFUs, even though B. anthracis was delivered as a spore; however, the degree of reduction was less than with the other bacteria ( Figure 1D , right). Pretreatment with the aerosolized NTHi lysate similarly reduced mortality and lung bacterial burden from intranasal instillation of 5 3 LD 50 Y. pestis ( Figure 1E ). NTHi lysate pretreatment also increased the time to median mortality, and reduced the lung bacterial burden (F), where pathogen burden was measured 24 hours after challenge due to very small inocula.

Mice that were not immunosuppressed experienced no mortality from an aerosolized inoculum of 3 3 10 8 conidia/ml (data not shown), but mice immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide and cortisol experienced approximately 70% mortality ( Figure 3A ). Pretreatment with the NTHi lysate reduced mortality to less than 10% ( Figure 3A ). Using a quantitative galactomannan assay ( Figure 3B ) and a quantitative RT-PCR assay for Aspergillus 18S rRNA ( Figure 3C ), the lung pathogen burden was found to be reduced approximately 10-fold 1 day after infection. Histopathologic evaluation of unpretreated immunosuppressed mice demonstrated abundant hyphal elements with extensive tissue invasion by 24 hours after challenge, in contrast to NTHi lysate-pretreated mice that demonstrated few fungal forms and little inflammation ( Figure 3D ). This suggests that, similar to protection against bacteria, NTHi lysate-stimulated protection against this fungus arises primarily from the induction of a microbicidal environment rather than the generation of cellular inflammation. Before challenge with P. aeruginosa (3 3 10 10 CFU/ml), Swiss-Webster mice were treated with NTHi lysate 7, 4, and 1 day before the infection, or only once 1 day before infection, or with PBS alone.

As such, the lungs were lavaged to remove alveolar macrophages and other leukocytes in the airway lumen, and the pulmonary circulation was perfused with PBS to remove intravascular leukocytes.

As protective responses to PAMPs have been shown to be IL-6-and TNF-dependent in other settings (28) , we sought to determine whether NTHi lysate-induced resistance was dependent on these inflammatory cytokines. Using an anti-TNF antibody that we have previously shown sufficient to block inflammatory cell infiltration after intratracheal TNF instillation (21), we found no difference in the protection induced by NTHi lysate treatment, nor in induced rapid pathogen killing (Figures 5B and 5C ). Although IL-6 2/2 mice have an increased baseline susceptibility to bacterial infections relative to wild-type C57BL/6 mice (29), we were still able to induce protection and rapid pathogen killing with NTHi lysate in the mutant mice ( Figures 5E and 5F ). Therefore, although inflammatory cytokines rise dramatically after stimulation, they may not be required. These results are consistent with our prior findings that neutrophil influx parallels induction of protection, but is not required (16) .",

Figure 6 shows that pretreatment of MLE-15 respiratory epithelial cells with NTHi lysate for 24 hours substantially reduces the pathogen burden in the culture media when inoculated with S. pneumoniae, B. anthracis, or P. aeruginosa ( Figures 6A-6C, respectively) . This observation was not restricted to MLE-15 cells. Rather, we consistently observed inducible bacterial killing by a variety of murine and human respiratory epithelial cells ( Figure E1 ). Additional media-only wells (i.e., no MLE-15 cells) confirmed that the antibacterial effect results from stimulation of the epithelial cells, rather than an intrinsic antibiotic effect of the lysate. In fact, the lysate appeared to promote pathogen growth in the absence of stimulated cells (Figures 6D-6F) . In contrast to our findings with respiratory epithelial cells, we did not observe similar inducible bacterial killing after treating dendritic cell or macrophage cell lines with NTHi lysate (Figures 6G-6I) .",

After treatment of MLE-15 cells with NTHi lysate or PBS (sham), we again found induction of broad gene expression changes in the NTHi lysate-treated cells, including many of the same inflammatory cytokines induced in the wholelung model (Figures 7A and 7B) . The induction of inflammatory cytokines by treatment was also confirmed at the protein level ( Figures 7C and 7D) . Using an FDR of 0.01, we found 207 differentially expressed transcripts after NTHi lysate treatment. In the interval between the in vivo and in vitro analyses, the commercially available Illumina Sentrix Mouse-6 BeadChip was changed to a new version (v1.0b to v1.1). To compare the whole-lung gene expression patterns to those of the in vitro studies, while accounting for minor changes in the probe sets, we decided to compare only the best-described transcripts. As such, we compared the RefSeq-annotated transcripts induced by NTHi lysate treatment with an FDR of less than 0.05. This yielded 379 common differentially expressed transcripts, of which 318 (83.9%) changed in a similar manner (i.e., were either both up-or down-regulated) in both models. Considering the potential effectors of the bacterial killing effect, we looked specifically at the antimicrobial peptides in Table 1 . A total of 18 of the 30 (60.0%) antimicrobial peptide transcripts identified in whole-lung model were also increased when the epithelial cells were stimulated in isolation (Table 2) . Of these, five transcripts were identified to be increased in all three analyses performed to date (proteomic analysis of mouse BAL fluid after treatment [16] , gene expression analysis of whole mouse lungs after treatment, and gene expression analysis of epithelial cells in vitro). These were chitinase 3-like 1, lipocalin 2, hemopexin, haptoglobin, and calgranulin B.",

The use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection cultivates microbial antibiotic resistance and causes host drug toxicity. We have previously demonstrated that protection against bacterial pneumonia by stimulation of lung innate immunity does not depend upon recruited neutrophils. Here, we similarly find that the aerosolized lysate protects against fungal pneumonia, despite neutrophil suppression with cyclophosphamide and cortisol ( Figure 3) . Therefore, patients undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy as part of cancer treatment, or in preparation for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, might benefit from stimulation of lung innate immunity during vulnerable periods of transient, severe myelosuppression. Because the augmentation of innate immune defenses is independent of adaptive immune function, the protective response can be induced even in the setting of T-cell suppression by fludarabine, or immunosuppression with calcineurin inhibitors or alkylating agents. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) lysate up-regulated antimicrobial genes were checked against expression sequence-tagged National Center for Biotechnology Information databases to identify those expressed in the lung.

Whereas neutrophils, mast cells, and alveolar macrophages are expendable in NTHi lysate-induced protection, we show here in vitro that respiratory epithelial cells are sufficient to sense the treatment and to generate an antimicrobial response. Having direct contact with the treatment, close apposition to deposited pathogens, and established capacity to generate antimicrobial products, the respiratory epithelium seems well suited to serve the StIR effector function in vivo. Although the 11 most strongly up-regulated genes after treatment encode cytokines, common mediators of inflammation, such as TNF and IL-6, are not required for induced resistance. This is consistent with our previous finding that neutrophil infiltration is not required for protection. On the other hand, our proteomic (16) and genomic ( Table 1 ) analyses indicate that the respiratory epithelium expresses numerous antimicrobial products in response to NTHi lysate treatment.",

The three known mouse acute-phase serum amyloid A (SAA) genes (43) comprise three of the four most highly up-regulated lung antimicrobial genes after in vivo NTHi lysate treatment. These enigmatic apolipoproteins promote host defense through widely varied mechanisms, including cathelicidin-like direct killing, pathogen opsonization, and induction of leukocyte chemotaxis (44) (45) (46) . Although only Saa3 was significantly up-regulated on the in vitro array, it is notable that the other two transcripts were higher at the 4-hour than the 2-hour time point in the in vivo studies, so it is possible that we had not observed the maximal expression at 2 hours. Also upregulated are the lipocalins, orosomucoid 1, orosomucoid 2, and lipocalin 2, that have recently been shown critical in host defenses against bacterial pathogens (47) (48) (49) . Their protective functions seem to result mainly from iron sequestration (48, 49) , although lipocalin 2 also appears key to IL-22-induced defenses in the respiratory epithelium (47) . Lipocalin 2 is one of five antimicrobial effectors that have been found to be up-regulated on all of our proteomic and gene expression screens after NTHi lysate treatment, making it an interesting candidate. However, we have not seen similarly broad or robust protection in previous studies addressing the antimicrobial effects of lipocalin 2. Therefore, we suspect that, if lipocalin 2 does participate in NTHi lysate-induced StIR, it is probably one of several antimicrobial effectors. The SAA proteins, the lipocalins, and the other antimicrobial products that we identified on these analyses will each be carefully explored as potential effectors, as they may play different roles with different pathogens. Investigations to identify novel NTHi-induced antimicrobial effectors are also underway, as well as exploration of other possible effector mechanisms, such as augmented barrier function. ",

We found that epithelial cells in isolation can be stimulated to kill bacteria, and that this is associated with gene expression patterns and cytokine elaboration that is very similar to that noted in the whole lung system, supporting our hypothesis that the epithelium is critical to StIR. In striking contrast, macrophages and dendritic cells could not be stimulated by the lysate to directly kill extracellular bacteria in vitro (Figure 6 ), consistent with our prior findings that macrophages are not required for in vivo StIR (16) . Nonetheless, dendritic cells may sense the stimulus in vivo and reinforce the epithelial effector response through local signaling via IL-22/STAT-3dependent mechanisms (47, 50, 51) .",
