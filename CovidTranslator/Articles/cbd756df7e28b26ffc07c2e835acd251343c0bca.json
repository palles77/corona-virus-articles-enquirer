If citizens are informed about their government's efforts to combat these diseases, will they reward incumbents who have performed well and punish those who have done poorly at this task? Electoral sanctioning requires that combatting disease be a sufficiently salient concern, which, in turn, is likely to depend upon subjective perceptions of the risks posed by particular illnesses. Epidemics typically prompt stronger risk perceptions than endemic diseases, but where both types circulate jointly, the more familiar endemic disease may determine public reactions. The salience of health threats also varies among individuals; those with a self-interest in prevention or a personal connection to the effects of mosquito-borne illnesses may react more strongly.",

Vectors for diseases such as malaria, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika thrive in wet, tropical climates. Countries closer to the equator tend to be poorer, producing living conditions-pools of standing water, open windows and fans rather than air conditioning-that facilitate mosquito reproduction and infection of humans (Gallup & Sachs, 2001) . Lower levels of education in society mean fewer medical personnel and public health workers available to fight disease (Frenk et al., 2010) . State capacity tends to be more limited as well, complicating efforts to mount large-scale public education campaigns or carry out householdlevel mosquito control efforts (Burkle, 2006 ). An additional challenge in combatting mosquito-borne illnesses in the developing world is distinctly political: inducing elected officials to prioritize the public good of disease control in contexts where clientelism and corruption may be common. The difficulties are often compounded when multiple levels of government are involved. Making funds available to local authorities for the purpose of fighting disease can potentially improve eradication efforts, since municipal officials tend to have better knowledge of their communities and may be more trusted by the population. Yet their political incentives may lead them to focus scarce resources on other priorities, such as infrastructure investment, that carry better expected electoral returns.",

Our study takes place in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil-the epicenter of the 2015-16 outbreak of congenital Zika syndrome, or the series of birth defects associated with the Zika virus. We conducted a face-to-face survey experiment in July 2016, informing the treatment group about the mayor's use of federal funds to hire public health workers for the purpose of controlling mosquitoborne illnesses.

Drawing on our survey as well as focus groups, we argue that most voters fail to act upon our treatment information because they primarily associate mosquito control with dengue, an endemic disease that has existed in Brazil for decades and is much more prevalent than Zika. Inducing behavioral changes in response to endemic diseases is much more difficult than in the case of epidemics because people have a tendency to discounts risks that are familiar and well-understood. While international media coverage focused extensively on the Zika epidemic, both citizens and politicians in Pernambuco are much more concerned with the quality of basic health services, such as the staffing of local medical centers.",

            "text": "As with many public goods, the delivery of governmentprovided health services involves a relationship among a principal in charge of the state, agents who act on the principal's behalf, and citizens who consume or are the targets of the services provided. Prior experimental studies of health service provision, primarily in the field of economics, have focused on the inherent principalagent problem in this relationship. Assuming that poor health indicators or service delivery statistics are primarily attributable to a lack of effort on the part of frontline providers, these studies have examined whether different forms of recruitment attract better health workers or whether performance incentives and monitoring can improve service provision for a given set of employees (Ashraf, Oriana, & Jack, 2014; Ashraf, Scott, & Lee, 2014; Ashraf, Scott, & Lee, 2016; Banerjee, Duflo, & Glennerster, 2008; Basinga et al., 2011; Callen, Gulzar, Hasanain, Khan, & Rezaee, 2018; Deserranno, 2017; Dhaliwal & Hanna, 2017; Gertler & Vermeersch, 2012; Mignozzetti, 2018; Miller et al., 2012) . Such studies implicitly or explicitly assume that principals desire better health service provision. In a review of the literature, Finan, Olken, and Pande (2017, 492) argue that in the case of ''frontline government service providers,\" including health workers, ''the government and the citizen's incentives are aligned: both would like the agent. . .to provide more or better services\".",

            "text": "Given that politicians' incentives may not be aligned with the goal of improved service delivery, several studies over the past decade have investigated the potential for social accountability: conveying information about government service delivery directly to citizens in the hopes that they will demand better performance from frontline providers (Fox, 2015; World Bank, 2016) . Conclusions from this research program have been mixed; one study shows that efforts to facilitate citizen monitoring improve service delivery and health outcomes (Bj\u00f6rkman & Svensson, 2009; Bj\u00f6rkman Nyqvist, de Walque, & Svensson, 2017) , whereas other studies in the area of education have found null effects on citizen engagement, learning outcomes, and teacher effort (Banerjee, Banerji, Duflo, Glennerster, & Khemani, 2010; Lieberman, Posner, & Tsai, 2014) . A general conclusion is that the effective exercise of social accountability is often inhibited by barriers to collective action, a low sense of efficacy, and a lack of knowledge of concrete steps that citizens can take to act upon information (Banerjee et al., 2010; Buntaine, Daniels, & Devlin, 2018; Fox, 2015; Lieberman et al., 2014) . 1 Yet direct citizen monitoring of agents is not the only way that information can potentially foster improved health outcomes. Rather than bypassing politicians with misaligned incentives, citizens can potentially change those incentives by conditioning their voting behavior on the quality of service provision (World Bank, 2016) . While pressuring frontline providers for better service may require collective action, a strong sense of efficacy, and knowledge of how to participate in new ways, the simple, individual, and routine act of voting faces few barriers of this sort. Fox (2015) thus issues a call to scholars to ''bring vertical accountability back in\" to the study of social accountability in the developing world. Sanctioning good performers and punishing bad performers at the ballot box can, in theory, be a powerful tool for development.",

There are few vaccination options for illnesses such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, and their most common host, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is resistant to fumigation efforts because it typically lives indoors where airborne insecticides do not penetrate (Gubler, 1989) . Hence, the most effective way to fight these diseases is to prevent their insect hosts from reproducing or infecting new individuals.

The most common of these is dengue fever, which has existed in Brazil since the late 19th century. Dengue is a viral disease spread primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Symptoms include fever, headache, joint pain, swollen lymph nodes, and a skin rash; most patients recover fully within a week. In a small percentage of cases, the disease develops into more dangerous and potentially life-threatening versions, including dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The overall risk of death is very low-less than one in one thousand in recent years in Brazil. 2 In recent years, two new diseases spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, Zika and chikungunya, have come to circulate in many of the same parts of Brazil historically affected by dengue. Both present very similar symptoms to those of dengue, and it is often difficult for physicians and health workers, much less the public, to tell them apart (Cardoso et al., 2015; Ioos et al., 2014; Moulin, Selby, Cherpillod, Kaiser, & Boillat-Blanco, 2016) . Chikungunya was first detected in Brazil in 2010 and began to spread widely in 2015-2016. As with dengue, most patents recover from the flu-like symptoms quickly, though joint pain sometimes lasts for several months. Also similar to dengue, the death rate from chikungunya has been low-less than one in one thousand in Brazil in 2016.",

The disease and its periodic outbreaks are a familiar feature of life in the region. Risk of death is low, the infection period is relatively short, and in the vast majority of cases, symptoms are no worse than those of the flu. Given this profile, studies of dengue in Brazil have reached similar conclusions as those from other countries with respect to subjective risk perception and preventive behavior. In the town of Santo Agostinho in Pernambuco, a study concluded that the public was well-informed about dengue but took insufficient measures to protect themselves from infection (Santos, dos Santos Pereira Cabral, & da Silva Augusto, 2011 Considered on their own, both chikungunya and Zika might be expected to generated a stronger sense of risk and a more robust public reaction. These diseases are new to Brazil, and their spread in 2015-2016 can be characterized as an epidemic. Much is still unknown about both-especially Zika, its relationship to microcephaly, and why there has been such as unusual concentration of cases in northeastern Brazil. The prognosis for babies born with congenital Zika syndrome is also uncertain, though initial evidence suggests that the associated birth defects are devastating. In general, the combination of newness, unfamiliarity, and, in the case of Zika, potentially severe consequences would predict a strong subjective sense of risk and a potential overreaction by the public.",

Respondents have no time to reflect upon the information before stating a vote intention, but they also have no time to forget it, weigh it against other concerns, hear denials and counterattacks from targeted politicians, or experience any number of other features of a real election that might be expected to diminish the magnitude of effects. Intended vote measured months before the election is also less likely to be affected by vote buying than is behavior on election day. In general, accountability experiments that ask about intended or hypothetical vote have recorded larger and more significant effects than those that ask about real-world voting behavior (Boas, Hidalgo, & Melo Forthcoming). Because ACE's mosquito control efforts target several diseases simultaneously, informing about local government's prioritization of this issue cannot exploit differences in the salience of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. Rather than disease-level variation, we focus on individual-level variation in salience. We test for heterogeneous treatment effects among subgroups for whom information about mosquito control ought to be more salient, due to selfinterest or a personal connection to the issue. First, we examine effects among those who have children under 9 months of agesuch that the mother would have given birth in October 2015 or later, when news of Zika was beginning to circulate-or are planning to have a child in the near future. This group faces a much greater risk of negative effects from contracting Zika, so they have (or recently had) a stronger self-interest in mosquito control. 4 We also examine effects among those who know someone with a child affected by microcephaly or the Zika virus. As with those who know someone who died of AIDS (Dionne, 2012 (Dionne, , 2018 , this group has seen firsthand the devastating effects of Zika and should be more attuned to the risks that it presents.",

Our discussion here draws upon our own notes as well as a report prepared by the survey firm. 7 While ACE work in conjunction with Family Health doctors and nurses, the personnel associated with each program have different responsibilities and areas of expertise. Hence, control of mosquito-borne illnesses is not subsumed under the Family Health Program; it would be plausible for candidates concerned with both issue areas to mention them separately. 8 For chikungunya, we account for the alternate spelling ''chicungunha\" as well as common misspellings. 9 The species of the mosquito that transmits dengue, chikungunya, and Zika is frequently mentioned in Brazilian news reports and government communications, and participants were readily familiar with the term.",

Yet attention focuses on aspects such as basic and emergency care rather than the prevention of mosquito-borne illnesses. In a context where prevailing diseases are endemic rather than epidemic, citizens may perceive that infection carries little risk. Moreover, blas\u00e9 attitudes may carry over from endemic diseases like dengue to epidemics like chikungunya and Zika if they are easily confused with one another, thanks to similar symptoms and the same insect host. Despite our overall null results, we also demonstrate a large and statistically significant punishment effect among residents who know someone affected by microcephaly or the Zika virus. Our study thus adds crucial empirical support to the common speculation that a lack of salience underlies null effects in information and accountability experiments. In other research emerging out of this broader project, we have obtained similar results. When informed of poor standardized test scores in the municipality, only parents of children enrolled in municipal schools, for whom information about educational performance ought to be most salient, vote against incumbent mayors (Boas, Hidalgo, & Toral, 2018) . We also find that salience matters for real electoral choices where voters are forced to make trade-offs among competing priorities, but not in hypothetical vignettes where they are free to consider treatment information in isolation from other concerns. Information about charges of mayoral malfeasance by an auditing agency-a low salience issue in municipal politics, compared to other, more tangible concerns-prompts a large punishment effect in the context of a vignette experiment but has null effects on vote for the incumbent in a real election (Boas et al., Forthcoming) .",

First, providing information about government performance on an issue that is salient for a larger share of voters might prompt electoral accountability on a broad scale. Basic medical services in local health clinics, which personally affect many more residents than microcephaly or the Zika virus, are a strong candidate. Second, information about government performance on less salient issues might still be able to change voting behavior if combined with educational messages that boost the salience of this information (Adida et al., 2016) . Informing about government mosquito control efforts could be accompanied by an additional message that distinguishes among the different diseases spread by mosquitos, gives concrete examples of local governments with good or bad performance in this area, and highlights the consequences for citizens' health. Future research could test whether an additional message of this sort succeeds in boosting the salience of mosquito control and the effect of information on voting behavior.",
