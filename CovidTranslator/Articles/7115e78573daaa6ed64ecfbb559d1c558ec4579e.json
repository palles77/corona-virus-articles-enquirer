We aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of combining point-of-care molecular viral test and serum procalcitonin (PCT) level for antibiotic stewardship in the emergency department (ED). Design: A prospective twin-center cohort study was conducted between January 2017 and March 2018. Setting and Participants: Older adult patients who presented to the ED with SARIs received a rapid molecular test for 17 respiratory viruses and a PCT test. Measures: To evaluate the clinical impact, we compared the outcomes of SARI patients between the experimental cohort and a propensity scoreematched historical cohort. The primary outcome was the proportion of antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation in the ED. The secondary outcomes included duration of intravenous antibiotics, length of hospital stay, and mortality. Results: A total of 676 patients were included, of which 169 patients were in the experimental group and 507 patients were in the control group. More than one-fourth (27.9%) of the patients in the experimental group tested positive for virus. Compared with controls, the experimental group had a significantly higher proportion of antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation in the ED (26.0% vs 16.1%, P \u00bc .007), neuraminidase inhibitor uses (8.9% vs 0.6%, P < .001), and shorter duration of intravenous antibiotics (10.0 vs 14.5 days, P < .001). Conclusions and Implications: Combining rapid viral surveillance and PCT test is a useful strategy for early detection of potential viral epidemics and antibiotic stewardship. Clustered viral respiratory infections in a nursing home is common. Patients transferred from nursing homes to ED may benefit from this approach.",

            "text": "Community-acquired respiratory tract infections are among the most common reasons for emergency department (ED) visits and can be caused by both viral and bacterial pathogens. Identification of the pathogen causing symptoms is critical for rapid institution of adequate antiviral or antibiotic therapy. Because of the challenges in differentiating between viral and bacterial pathogens, patients with viral respiratory infections are usually underdetected, and unnecessary antibacterial agents are more likely to be administered. Therefore, laboratory tests providing accurate and timely determination of the infectious agents associated with viral respiratory diseases are important. A broad array of tests is available to detect viral respiratory agents. Rapid antigen tests are available for influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but these tests have low sensitivity and specificity. 1, 2 The authors declare no conflicts of interest. Molecular diagnostic tests using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to detect the RNA or DNA of the infectious agents show high sensitivity and specificity, but they are technically challenging and time consuming. The advent of sensitive point-of-care (POC) molecular detection methods has made rapid diagnosis of respiratory virus infections possible. The FilmArray system (bioFire Diagnostics, Inc, Salt Lake City, UT) is a desktop automated real-time PCR system that integrates sample preparation, amplification, detection, and analysis into 1 complete process that delivers results in 1 hour. The respiratory panel can detect 17 respiratory viruses and 3 bacterial targets in a single reaction. 3 Initial studies demonstrated that such POC multiplex PCR systems identified previously under-evaluated viral or atypical infections in ED dyspneic patients, and the additional information on rapid respiratory infection testing may also change the physician's antibiotic-prescribing behavior, enabling more timely and appropriate treatment. 4e6 The hospital length of stay and direct medical cost for patients with the identified respiratory pathogens decreased. 7e16 Despite the availability of highly accurate viral testing results, the discontinuation or the de-escalation of antibiotics still raises concerns because mixed virus-bacteria coinfection, especially influenza with pneumococcus, is common in older adults. 17 In this study, we proposed a diagnostic approach that combines the multiplex PCR respiratory panel with procalcitonin (PCT) tests to better guide the antibiotic treatment. PCT is a precursor of calcitonin that is constitutively secreted by C cells of the thyroid gland and K cells of the lungs. In healthy individuals, PCT is normally undetectable (<0.01 ng/mL). When stimulated by endotoxin, PCT is rapidly produced by parenchymal tissue throughout the body. Unlike C-reactive protein, PCT does not respond to sterile inflammation or viral infection. 18 This distinctive characteristic makes PCT a valuable diagnostic marker.",

Older adults are more vulnerable to respiratory virus infection. Because of undifferentiated clinical manifestation between bacterial and viral infection, antibiotic overuse in this population is common. In this study, we aimed to assess the impact of implementing a diagnostic algorithm that combines rapid respiratory viral surveillance and PCT tests on older patients presenting to the ED with severe acute respiratory illness.

Eligible patients received a rapid molecular test with 17 respiratory viruses and a PCT test. The results of the respiratory panel or PCT tests were communicated to the treating physicians directly by the study nurse as soon as they were available and were kept in the medical records. The study nurse reminded the treating physician of the recommendation of antibiotic treatment based on different viral and PCT testing results. The detection of influenza initiates isolation or neuraminidase inhibitor use. The detection of a virus with an elevated serum PCT level (!0.25 ng/mL) may indicate the possibility of a superimposed bacterial infection and justify the continual use of antibacterial treatment in patients with noneinfluenza virus infection and combined antiviral and antibacterial treatment in patients with influenza infection. A positive result for respiratory virus with a low serum PCT level and stable clinical manifestation may allow early discontinuation or de-escalation of empiric antibiotics. De-escalation was defined as changing to a narrower-spectrum antibiotic or shifting the intravenous antibiotics to oral form. A negative respiratory virus test result with a low serum level of PCT (<0.25 ng/mL) would prompt clinicians to consider noninfectious causes of respiratory distress, such as acute exacerbation of obstructive airway disease, acute decompensated heart failure, or fluid overload.",

A pre-post study showed that the use of the respiratory panel decreased the time to diagnosis of respiratory viruses, hospital admission rate, length of stay, number of chest radiographs, and duration of antimicrobial use. 13 Gelfer et al 21 combined the respiratory panel and PCT tests, but found no significant differences in overall antibiotic exposure between the experimental and standard-of-care groups.

Historically, it has been advised to complete the course of intravenous antibiotics treatment despite the resolution of clinical symptoms. However, there is little evidence to support this practice. 22, 23 Overuse of antibiotics was associated with increased risk of Clostridioides difficile infection, and a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics may increase the risk of adverse drug events, organ dysfunction, or mortality. 24 It is noteworthy that the identification of respiratory virus alone may not be sufficient to reduce antibiotic use because of the concerns regarding mixed virus-bacteria coinfection, especially influenza with pneumococcus infection. 25 Low serum level of PCT may help alleviate the concerns of mixed infection. In addition, communicating the results to the treating physicians is important. 13, 16 Although we did not have a formal antibiotic stewardship team, the study nurse communicated the results to the treating physicians and promoted antibiotics stewardship. Another finding is the underdiagnosis of influenza in older adult patients. Older adult patients were less likely to undergo a provider-ordered influenza test. They usually lack the typical presentation of influenza-like illness and may present with respiratory distress or confusion. 26 A recent study showed that the diagnosis of influenza based on clinical grounds alone was associated with a suboptimal sensitivity of 36% and a specificity of 78%. 27 Effect estimates for dichotomous outcomes were calculated by logistic regression whereas those for continuous outcomes were calculated using quantile regression.

It is estimated that approximately two-thirds of NH residents received antibiotics each year, and up to 75% of the treatment is inappropriate. NHs become the reservoirs for resistant bacteria within a community. 31 Although the present protocol cannot be implemented in NHs, it can be used among severe NH patients who are transferred to the ED. In a less severe outbreak, the nasopharyngeal samples of NH residents can be collected and sent to contracted laboratories for respiratory panel testing.

The reduction of intravenous antibiotic duration alone is important because it has been shown to be a strong risk factor for the development of resistant bacteria strains.
