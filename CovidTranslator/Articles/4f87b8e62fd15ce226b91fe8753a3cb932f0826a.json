Therefore, rapid and a accurate identification of pathogenic viruses plays a vital role in selecting appropriate treatments, saving people's lives and preventing epidemics. It is important to establish a quick standard diagnostic test for the detection of the infectious disease (COVID-19) to prevent subsequent secondary spread. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is regarded as a gold standard test for the molecular diagnosis of viral and bacterial infections with high sensitivity and specificity. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification is considered to be a highly promising candidate method due to its fundamental advantage in quick procedure time at constant temperature without thermocycler operation. A variety of improved or new approaches also have been developed. This review summarizes the currently available detection methods for coronavirus nucleic acid. It is anticipated that this will assist researchers and clinicians in developing better techniques for timely and effective detection of coronavirus infection.",

Novel PCR-based methods also have been reported to enhance both the specificity and sensitivity of the assay. Besides, several molecular tests which employ non-PCR-based methods, such as isothermal nucleic acid amplification (loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification), were developed for the detection of coronavirus RNA.

It is widely used to amplify minute quantities of biologic materials so as to provide adequate specimens for laboratory study. Owing to its large range of applications, high sensitivity and high sequence specificity, the PCR-based method has become a routine and reliable technique for detecting coronaviruses [6, 7] . Generally, coronavirus RNA is transferred into cDNA by reverse transcription. Afterwards, the PCR is performed and followed by the detection of PCR product through specific detection methods or instruments. Among these, gel visualization and sequencing after PCR are the conventional methods for the detection of coronaviruses [8, 9] . However, due to its time-consuming process and high cost, these methods are not commonly used in clinical samples.",

However, such problems could be well avoided in real-time RT-PCR assays where EPC is an important component. Yu et al. [17] developed a real-time RT-PCR assay in which the armored RNA was used as EPC to detect the SARS-CoV, with a detection limit of 10 copies/mL. Meanwhile, the rapidly mutating nature of coronaviruses highlights the need for accurate detection of genetically diverse coronaviruses. Therefore, to improve the ability to detect coronavirus precisely and reduce the risk of eliciting false-negative results caused by genome sequence variations, researchers have established multiplex real-time RT-PCR methods with favorable sensitivity for multitarget detection of coronavirus. Hadjinicolaou et al. [18] developed a real-time RT-PCR assay using mismatch-tolerant molecular beacons to distinguish between pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains. The assay incorporated four beacons, targeting four genes in addition to an internal positive control. It was validated using clinical samples, which exhibited target detection ability and specificity with detection limit of 5 copies per reaction.",

A sequence-specific and robust method for monitoring LAMP and other isothermal amplification reactions that can readily separate true signal from nonspecific noise would address this problem. Shirato et al. [27] improved the RT-LAMP assay by using a quenching probe (QProbe) to monitor signal, which has the same performance as the standard real-time RT-PCR assay in the detection of MERS-CoV. Additionally, Huang et al. [4] established a nucleic acid visualization technique that combines RT-LAMP and a vertical flow visualization strip (RT-LAMP-VF) to detect MERS-CoV. As illustrated in Fig. 1A , two loop primers (LF and LB) involved in isothermal amplification are labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and biotin, respectively. After amplification, the amplicons labeled with biotin can bind to colloidal gold particles conjugated with streptavidin to form a complex which is subsequently captured by an anti-FITC antibody coated on the text line of the strip (Fig. 1B) , thus presenting a colored line that is visible to the naked eye. In this instance, MERS-CoV RNA can be detected with a detection limit of 10 copies/mL.",

They replaced the intercalating dye typically used for monitoring in real-time fluorescence with a toehold-mediated strand exchange reaction termed one-step strand displacement (OSD) and applied it for real-time sequencespecific verification of LAMP amplicons [28e30]. The resulting assays could detect 0.02 to 0.2 PFU (5e50 PFU/mL) of MERS-CoV in infected cell culture supernatants within 30e50 min and did not cross-react with common human respiratory pathogens [31] . Other strand exchange signal transductions were developed to make LAMP reaction user-friendly. As shown in Fig. 2 , by combining LAMP with a thermostable invertase, Du et al. can directly transduce MERS coronavirus templates into glucose signals, which can be easily read by a commercial glucometer, with a sensitivity as low as 20e100 copies/mL, equating to atto-molar (or low zepto-mole) [32] . The human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was also used as the signal as its analyte was already sensitively detected by commercial pregnancy test kits. The hCG was site-specifically conjugated to a DNA oligonucleotide, thereby allowing signal transduction via strand exchange into both capture (signal-off) and release (signal-on) of hCG in the LAMP based virus assay [33] . The incorporation of an engineered hCG reporter protein led to LAMPto-hCG signal transduction on low-cost, commercially available pregnancy test strips. This assay reliably detected as few as 20 copies of virus templates in both human serum and saliva.",

However, each of the methods described above has its own unique advantages and inevitable disadvantages. PCR is widely used for virus identification with high sensitivity and specificity, but its analysis requires various equipment and educated analysts, which is only possibly accomplished by a well-established laboratory. LAMP is an ultrasensitive nucleic acid amplification method that can often detect small numbers of DNA or RNA templates within roughly an hour, but the requirement for high temperatures still limits its applicability. As for the microarray, the high cost inevitably limits its further application in the detection of coronaviruses. Therefore, it is still necessary to develop more effective and practical methods to overcome the shortcomings of the existing methods in the future.",

In short, with the rapid development of new technologies and methods, we believe that there will be more excellent and efficient detection methods developed in the future, which would provide scientists/clinicians with more choices. At the same time, only by balancing the advantages and disadvantages of various detection assays according to specific purposes can we obtain the most economical and optimal option.",
