By March 3, 2020, there were 80,303 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China. Among these patients, 2597 died. A total of 12,536 patients were diagnosed in 74 countries outside China, 216 of whom died.",

The crazy-paving pattern referred to GGO with superimposed reticular opacity. Consolidation referred to an area of increased attenuation in the lung that obscured the underlying pulmonary vessels. Air bronchogram is defined as air-filled bronchi on a background of high-attenuation lung (4). Stripe was defined as an irregular line or band with a high-attenuation pattern. Cavity referred to the pattern formed after the excretion of the necrotic tissue inside the lesion through the bronchi (4).

Third, all patients showed GGO on thin-section CT, more than half of which were round GGO; 89.36% of the patients showed the crazy-paving pattern, and air bronchogram could develop in GGO. Fourth, the consolidations can appear in the center of the GGO, and can be patchy. Fifth, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and pleural effusion were rare.

            "text": "Before SARS-CoV-2, there are six coronavirus, four of which are less pathogenic and generally cause mild respiratory symptoms, the other two coronavirus has caused two epidemics since the beginning of the 21st century. The first epidemic was severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, which is also known as atypical pneumonia, with a mortality rate of 9.6% (5). The second was Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) cause by MERS-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 and 2015, with a mortality rate of 35.7% (6) . The third is COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 (7). The CT imaging features are closely related to the pathology. At present, one study showed the similar pathological characteristics to the same SARS-CoV infection (8) . It is reported in the literature that acute diffuse alveolar injury can be observed in the acute stage (<11 days) of SARS, and in the late stage, diffuse alveolar injury and acute fibrous and organic pneumonia can be observed (9) . The pathological changes include thickening of the basement membrane of the alveoli capillary, edema of the alveoli septum, hyperplasia of the interstitium, apoptosis and desquamation of the alveolar epithelium cells, formation of the pulmonary hyaline membrane by exudate and other cellular components in the alveoli, hyperemia and edema of the bronchioles, infiltration of inflammatory cells and inflammatory edema, red blood cells in the alveoli, and microthrombosis formation in the blood vessels (10, 11) . Due to the small number of autopsies on patients with MERS, detection of pathological basis was limited. Diffuse alveolar damage was also found in the lungs in two autopsies, including damage to alveolar epithelial cells, multinuclear epithelial cells, and submucosal glands (12, 13) . In the animal model of MERS, consolidation, edema, and inflammation can be found in the infected lungs, and diffuse alveolar injury with hyaline membrane formation can also be observed (14\u00c016). Based on the pulmonary infection of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (8\u00c011), GGOs may be due to mild edema of the alveolar septi, hyperplasia of the interstitium, partial filling of airspaces, or a combination of these features. The crazy-paving pattern may correlate with hyperplasia of interlobular and intralobular interstitia. Consolidation may be related to acute diffuse alveolar injury, including edema, red blood cells and cellulose deposition. Stripe may reflect the thickening pulmonary interstitium or fibrosis. Whether stripes are resorbed should be observed in the future. SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are all infectious diseases caused by coronaviruses, so the CT images of patients with these three diseases are similar. The earliest stage of SARS manifests as GGO, which mainly follows a subpleural distribution. SARS with diffuse GGOs progresses into acute respiratory distress syndrome (17, 18) , and the reticulation superimposed on GGO can present as a crazy-paving pattern. Consolidation is common, and the margins are obscure. Air bronchograms and cavity can be observed. The presence of spontaneous pneumomediastinum can distinguish SARS from other diseases (17) . SARS rapidly progresses, and multiple segments and multiple lobes are involved. MERS mainly manifests as subpleural GGO, and the range of GGO is larger than that of consolidations; some lesions can be distributed along the bronchovascular bundles. Pleural effusion can occur in some cases (19, 20) . The CT imaging findings of COVID-19 partially overlap those of SARS and MERS, but the unique CT features of COVID-19 are as follows. First, GGO is mostly round on the initial thin-section CT, the crazy-paving pattern is common, subpleural distribution is predominant, patchy consolidations are visible in the center of some GGOs, and air bronchogram can be simultaneously observed in the GGO and consolidation; the pneumomediastinum, cavities, and pleural effusion have not been observed. Second, in severe cases, the consolidation gradually increases. GGO decrease but can still be observed on the margins of consolidation. The crazy-paving pattern still presents in the GGO, which may be due to fibrosis.",

But two of the six patients showed pneumonia during follow-up. Therefore, CT manifestations of COVID-19 lag behind the NAAT detection. Although CT imaging has certain lag time, nucleic acid, and gene sequencing detection require a relatively longer time compared to CT. Thus, for the timely and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19, CT can quickly identify suspected patients and significantly help in isolating the source of infection, cutting off the route of transmission, and avoiding further spread of infection. In this study, a few patients had a clear epidemiological history and typical CT findings indicative of COVID-19, while the nucleic acid test was negative, and the final diagnosis of COVID-19 was determined after several rounds of negative results. Therefore, CT scanning is necessary for patients suspected of having COVID-19.",

            "text": "This study has two limitations. First, all cases were examined by CT, and plain chest radiographs were not obtained. Although plain chest radiography and CT are both necessary to examine lung lesions and can demonstrate disease progression, plain chest radiographs are superimposed imaging that cannot clearly display GGO lesions. In contrast, CT imaging, especially thin-section CT imaging, which is comparable to directly viewing the anatomy, can clearly reveal the structures of both lungs with high resolution, can aid in the diagnosis of lung diseases, and can be used for the timely and accurate observation of disease progression (21) . Therefore, thin-section CT is recommended for patients at the early stage of COVID-19 to avoid missing lesions, and plain chest radiography is recommended for re-examination in patients with severe conditions and in patients who cannot undergo CT to observe changes in their conditions. Second, due to the rapid onset of COVID-19, the interval between examinations was short. We will continue to conduct follow-up studies to observe the dynamic changes in COVID- 19. In summary, COVID-19 pneumonia manifests primarily as GGO and consolidation distributed predominantly along the subpleural area of the lung. Round GGO and crazy-paving pattern are commonly seen. Air bronchograms are often found in both GGO and consolidation. Cavities, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, or pleural effusions are absent on the initial CT examinations. In the short-term follow-up, more patients had disease progression than absorption. Identification of CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia provide timely diagnostic evidence of the disease enabling early diagnosis and treatment.",
