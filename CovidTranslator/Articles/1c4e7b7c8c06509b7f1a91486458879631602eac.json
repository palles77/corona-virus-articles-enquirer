Furthermore, Shi et al. have reported radiological abnormality, predominantly ground-glass opacity (GGO), in subclinical disease, where 15 patients were imaged using CT before symptom onset. 10 As such, the precise time when imaging becomes abnormal is heterogeneous and the disease should not be excluded based on a normal CT examination acquired early after symptom onset.",

In a study of 1,014 patients with both CT chest and RT-PCR, the sensitivity of CT was 97% relative to positive RT-PCR. 16 In patients with initial negative RT-PCR but positive CT, 81% were reclassified as \"highly likely\" or \"probable\" cases for COVID-19 by analysis of clinical symptoms, typical CT manifestations, and longitudinal CT follow-up. Although flaws in the analysis of this paper exist (including lack of correlation with biochemical parameters), the presence or absence of \"lung disease\" on CT may be relevant in disease containment or risk stratification, as the interval between initial negative to positive RT-PCR was 4e8 days. The implications for CT in diagnosis are illustrated by the surge in diagnoses of COVID-19 on 12 February 2020 in Hubei following the introduction of new diagnostic criteria that included CT changes. 17 This has facilitated timely treatment and isolation measures; however, the challenge remains that no abnormality may be present on CT preformed early in the disease.",
