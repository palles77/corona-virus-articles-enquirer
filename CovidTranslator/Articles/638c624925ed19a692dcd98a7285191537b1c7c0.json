However, the performance in children under two months of age (AUC 0.88) is 278 promising and might provide additive value in clinical decision making. Currently, there are no comparable 279 laboratory based studies assessing the identification of mild disease. Clinical rules for safe discharge based on 280 age and findings at physical examination have been developed. Unfortunately, in these studies children below 281 2 months of age were excluded or automatically admitted regardless of the necessity of treatment. of patients with severe disease was accurate with the chosen inflammatory markers (AUC 284 0.89). The prediction performed better than age on itself (AUC 0.77). A prediction rule based on IL-8 and 285 RANTES in plasma and CD4 + T cell counts accurately identifies severe disease, but needs to be validated in an 286 independent cohort to establish clinical potential. 16 A combination of biochemical, hematological and clinical 287 data might further improve accuracy. A drawback of introducing clinical variables is that most of the published 288 risk factors in clinical prediction are not objective or may change rapidly in time. Moreover, signs and 289 symptoms of children can be ambiguous at the moment of presentation and only become clear after prolonged 290 observation. Prediction rules using clinical data, often show a lower AUC and validation studies of these rules 291 are lacking or have a smaller sample size. 4,37 292 293 The advantage of measuring markers in plasma is the easy implementation, speed, reproducibility and 294 standardisation. Moreover, with the use of linear regression tools it is easy to add new markers to optimize the 295 rule. It is tempting to speculate that some of the biomarkers precede clinical symptoms and could therefore be 296 used early in the course of disease to predict severe outcome. Currently, there is no targeted therapy for most 297 respiratory viruses and therefore there are no consequences to the early identification of patients with a 298 severe course of disease besides optimalisation of supportive care. The identification of children with a mild 299 course of disease has more visible consequences, as can be measured in reduced hospitalisation rates or length 300 of stay in the hospital. To truly estimate the value of the markers a prospective study is needed, moreover it 301 would be interesting to measure the markers earlier in the course of disease. However, even before the implemented in the clinic, biomarkers could be used to stratify patients in clinical studies and as 303 secondary end-point in intervention studies.

However, the performance in children under two months of age (AUC 0.88) is 302 promising and might provide additive value in clinical decision making. Currently, there are no comparable 303 laboratory based studies assessing the identification of mild disease. Clinical rules for safe discharge based on 304 age and findings at physical examination have been developed. Unfortunately, in these studies children below 305 2 months of age were excluded or automatically admitted regardless of the necessity of treatment. 5,33,37,38 306 307 The identification of patients with severe disease was accurate with the chosen inflammatory markers (AUC 308 0.89).

A prediction rule based on IL-8 and 309 RANTES in plasma and CD4 + T cell counts accurately identifies severe disease, but needs to be validated in an 310 independent cohort to establish clinical potential. 16 A combination of biochemical, hematological and clinical 311 data might further improve accuracy. A drawback of introducing clinical variables is that most of the published 312 risk factors in clinical prediction are not objective or may change rapidly in time.

The advantage of measuring markers in plasma is the easy implementation, speed, reproducibility 344 and standardisation.

Moreover, the performance of the rule was best in patients under two months of age (<60.5 days) in whom it is clinically difficult to predict the course of disease.Interestingly, most of the inflammatory markers investigated in this study have not been described in the 290 context of viral LRTI or disease severity. The increase of CRP and SAA levels during viral infection was known and this was also the reason to include the proteins in our study. We were able to confirm the work of Huttunen et al. that the ratio SAA/CRP is significantly decreased in patients with severe disease compared to patients with mild and moderate disease (data not shown).25  Moreover, CRP and SAA levels both correlated with severity of viral LRTI's and CRP was also correlated with length of hospitalisation. To the best of our knowledge, these findings have not been described before. The increase in PTX3 levels during more severe disease and a correlation with need for supplemental oxygen show the potential of PTX3 as biomarker for viral LRTI in children. This was already proposed by others, who saw a correlation with peak temperature, duration of fever and presence of pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients.17,19  Although SAP levels significantly 299 increase during infection, no correlation could be observed with disease severity in children with viral LRTI.Therefore, it appears that SAP could not be used as a biomarker for disease severity in viral or bacterial301 infections. 28 This study is the first to describe the remarkable kinetics of CFP (Properdin) levels, which decrease 302 during severe viral infection in children. We were unable to find an explanation in literature. However, since CFP levels restored in the available recovery samples, a deficiency is highly unlikely. Other possible 304 explanations for the decrease might be consumption, as occurs with other complement factors, or an 305 (unrecognised) bacterial co-infection. Although cultures were routinely taken at the intensive care unit before 306 the start of SDD antibiotics, bacterial infections cannot be ruled out completely. A sub analysis of patients with 307 (n=10) and without (n=15) positive bacterial cultures on the ICU showed no difference in protein levels (data not shown). During the study period selective digestive decontamination (SDD) was standard practice in the ICU and therefore all severe patients would have had at least one gift of prophylactic antibiotics before the 310 study samples were taken. The prediction rule for the identification of children with a mild course of disease appeared to be insufficient for clinical use (AUC 0.65). However, the performance in children less than two months of age (AUC 0.88) is promising and might provide additive value in clinical decision making. Currently, there are no comparable laboratory based studies assessing the identification of mild disease. Clinical rules for safe discharge based on age and findings at physical examination have been developed. Unfortunately, in these studies children below 317 2 months of age were excluded or automatically admitted regardless of the necessity of treatment. 5,33,37,38The identification of patients with severe disease was accurate with the chosen inflammatory markers (AUC 320 0.89). The prediction performed better than age on itself (AUC 0.77). A prediction rule based on IL-8 and RANTES in plasma and CD4 + T cell counts accurately identifies severe disease, but needs to be validated in an 322 independent cohort to establish clinical potential.16  A combination of biochemical, hematological and clinical data might further improve accuracy.

Moreover, signs and symptoms of children can be ambiguous at the moment of presentation and only become clear after prolonged observation. Prediction rules using clinical data often show a lower AUC and validation studies of these rules are lacking or have a smaller sample size.4,39    Limitations of our study are the limited number of patients in the mild age group, especially patients younger than two months of age. This influenced our analyses and hindered the logistic regression analysis in the prediction of mild disease. Since venapuncture is not always part of routine care, especially not in this patient group parents often refuse participation or the venapuncture specific. Therefore the performance of our rule 333 in the mild patient group under two months of age needs further testing Moreover, a prospective study in which results are available for the clinicians is needed to assess the clinical implications of our rule.Age is always a confounder in studies on disease severity in infants with RSV. We could not find correlations in the acute samples after correcting for age and multiple testing, however we did observe a positive correlation 337 between age and SAA and SAP in the recovery samples (data not shown).
