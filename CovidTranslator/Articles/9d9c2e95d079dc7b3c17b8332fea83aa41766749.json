Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association 34 (6), 477e483]. Nine cats diagnosed with multiple myelomas were retrospectively identified over a 16-year period (1986e2002) . Cats with multiple myelomas were older than 7 years (mean age 11.7 years); six males and three females were affected (2.1), but no breed predisposition was evident. Treatment of multiple myelomas consisted of supportive management in the nine cats and anti-neoplastic therapy in eight cats. Supportive treatment consisted of maintaining hydration, renal function and antimicrobial therapy even when there was no sign of infection. Anti-neoplastic therapy with melphalan and prednisolone was carried out in eight cats. Three failed to respond to treatment and five responded to treatment, but the response was only partial and temporary in one cat. The five cats that responded were improved clinically and had reduced serum protein levels. Five out of eight cats (63%) responded to chemotherapy, and it appeared to be complete in four cats and partial in one cat. Survival time in those cats was 15, 4, 17 and 24 months. M ultiple myelomas are plasma cell neoplasms of the bone marrow (Osborne et al 1968) . Reports of multiple myeloma in cats are infrequent; there are 34 reported cases with no series describing more than six cats (MacEwen and Hurvitz 1977) . Multiple myeloma accounts for less than 1% of feline haematopoietic neoplasm and plasmacytomas are rarer than multiple myelomas (Eastman 1996 , Jacobs 1994 .",

The relationship between the development of renal disease and the presence of Bence Jones proteins may be related to the fact that Bence Jones proteins are nephrotoxic (Hurvitz et al 1971) or the production of light-chain protein metabolic degradation by renal tubular cells causing direct tubular damage and kidney dysfunction (Levi et al 1968 , Fer et al 1981 . Cases 1, 8 and 9 had increased total calcium and ionised calcium concentrations. Measurement of ionised concentration is essential as increased serum protein concentration may result in 'falsely' increased total serum calcium concentrations as more calcium is bound to the proteins in the blood. Two of these cats (cases 1 and 8) had evidence of renal disease. Possible causes of renal insufficiency that occurs with multiple myelomas are first, hypercalcaemia can cause renal mineralisation (Kruger and Osborne 1994) ; second, myeloma cells can infiltrate the kidney (Osserman et al 1987) ; third, paraproteins can infiltrate the kidney (Osserman et al 1987, Alexanian and Dimopouls 1994) .",

No neoplasia was found within organs of the abdomen and/ or the thorax. Instead granulomatous lesions, which appeared as white foci on cut surfaces were found in the liver, kidneys, abdominal lymph nodes and spleen, confirming feline infectious peritonitis. The cat also had pulmonary haemorrhage, oedema, myocardial necrosis and blood filled bladder indicating that this cat is likely to have had hyperviscosity syndrome secondary to its elevated globulins, which probably led to cardiac hypoxia, pulmonary haemorrhage, oedema and bladder haemorrhage. The cat did not have classic monoclonal gammopathy; rather, it had a polyclonal gammopathy. A possible explanation for the absence of monoclonal gammopathy is the presence of feline infectious peritonitis. The virus could have been present subclinically before the development of the plasma cell neoplasia, and feline infectious peritonitis became clinically apparent when normal immunoglobulin levels became severely depressed.",

This may be because the cause of haematuria was hyperviscosity syndrome rather than infection. In our experience one of the main differential diagnoses of multiple myelomas in cats is feline infectious peritonitis. Both may be presented with a similar clinical and haematological picture. The main differences were the identification of high levels of coronavirus titre; absence of Bence Jones protein in the urine and electrophoresis consistently produced polyclonal gammopathy in both blood and urine in feline infectious peritonitis.",
