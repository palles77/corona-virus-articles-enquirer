The epitopes combined with the neutralizing antibodies are mapped on a few isolated locations on the surface of viral proteins. The structure of human rhinovirus complexed with Fab fragments showed that the antibody makes contact with an area about 6 nm 2 and that the epitope spans different discontinuous polypeptides. Therefore, an effective vaccine usually needs to include a complete viral protein or a large fragment. The binding of the antibodies does not significantly change the structure of the antigen. The exact mechanism by which antibodies neutralize antigens is dependent upon the binding site and processes of the virus replication.",

Detection was originally based on a five-to six-pointed star morphology of virions by electron microscopy (EM) . However, only about 10% of viral particles display these structures; the remaining 90% of particles have a smooth surface and a size similar to other small, round-structured viruses like picornaviruses and caliciviruses. Thus, accurate diagnostics were difficult to obtain and the true prevalence of astrovirus within a population was difficult to assess. Development of much more sensitive detection techniques like real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), cell culture RT-PCR, and astrovirusspecific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have made detection more accurate and specific, even allowing diagnosis of specific serotypes. Utilizing these techniques, astroviruses have been found in approximately 3-8% of children with diarrhea. Astroviruses can also be isolated in a subset of asymptomatic individuals, suggesting that a proportion of infected individuals shed the virus asymptomatically or for some time after the resolution of other symptoms of infection. Asymptomatic carriers may be a major reservoir for astroviruses in the environment and could contribute to dissemination of the virus.",

Later that year, Madeley and Cosgrove identified the virus in association with diarrhea in children and bestowed the name astrovirus (from the Greek astron, meaning star) for the star-like morphology of a proportion of viral particles seen by EM (Figure 1(a) ). Because of genomic similarities, astroviruses were originally thought to belong to either the families Picornaviridae or Caliciviridae. However, the lack of a helicase and use of a frameshifting event during replication (discussed below) distinguish astroviruses so completely that, in 1993, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) classified astroviruses as a unique family, Astroviridae, composed of a single genus Astrovirus. Continued investigation into newly discovered astroviruses led to the division of the family into two genera, Mamastrovirus and Avastrovirus, by the ICTV in 2005. ICTV nomenclature abbreviates astrovirus AstV, with a single-letter abbreviation for the species type (i.e., human astrovirus; HAstV; turkey astrovirus; TAstV, etc.). Successive, serologically distinct isolates of astroviruses are named sequentially within that species (i.e., HAstV-1 through HAstV-8).",

While the exact incidences of infection vary from study to study, community-acquired astroviruses are found in 3-6% of children with infectious gastroenteritis. In some developing countries, infection rates as high as 20% have been observed. In many cases, astroviruses are the second most commonly detected viral pathogen in young children after rotavirus. Astrovirus infections are identified in up to 2% of asymptomatic individuals. These data may underrepresent actual astrovirus infections, as studies generally survey individuals visiting medical care centers. Because astrovirus disease is generally mild in humans (see the section discussing pathogenesis), hospital cases may represent only a slight proportion of actual infections in the community. In support of this, serological studies have demonstrated that up to 90% of children have been exposed to at least one strain of astrovirus by age 9. Eight serotypes of human astrovirus have been identified to date, with all eight circulating within the global population to various levels. HAstV-1 is by far the most prevalent serotype, comprising 25-100% of astroviruses in a region, and the most prevalent reactivity of antibodies detected, although serological surveys of all serotypes have not been undertaken. HAstV-6, -7, and -8 are the least frequently detected, although three to four serotypes of HAstV are often detected in a region at any given time. The differing prevalence of serotypes could be a reflection of severity; perhaps HAstV-1 infection results in a higher frequency of hospital visits than other serotypes and is therefore overrepresented in hospital-based epidemiological studies. Alternatively, serotypes may be restricted by region. For example, one Mexican study identified HAstV-1 as the predominant serotype throughout the country, but HAstV-3 and -8 were prominent in select regions.",

Astrovirus outbreaks have also been associated with high-density environments, including childcare centers, primary and junior high schools, military recruiting centers, elderly care centers, and swimming pools.

While astroviruses were originally identified in humans, they have since been identified in both mammalian and avian species, including rabbits, mice, calves, sheep, piglets, dogs, red-tailed deer, kittens, mink, turkeys, ducklings, chicken, and guinea fowl. At least three serotypes of bovine astroviruses are postulated to exist based on distinct neutralizing antibodies (one in the United States and two in the United Kingdom). In addition, astroviruses have been isolated from mink across Scandinavia, and serological studies have demonstrated that astroviruses were prevalent in chicken flocks in the 1980s as well as in 2001. Interestingly, two very different manifestations of chicken astrovirus infection have been described (see the section on pathogenesis), suggesting that distinct chicken astroviruses may circulate; however, this is yet to be proven. The best epidemiologically characterized animal astroviruses are the turkey astroviruses. Surveillance of turkey flocks in the 1980s isolated astrovirus from 78% of diseased flocks, but only 29% of normal flocks. Astroviruses were the first pathogen detected in many flocks and were most commonly detected in birds less than 4 weeks of age. Similar to human infections, turkey astrovirus was frequently isolated with other pathogens, most commonly rotavirus-like viruses. The early age of infection and the prevalence of co-infections led one group to postulate that astrovirus infection may predispose birds to infection by other viruses.",

Propagation of porcine, bovine, and chicken astroviruses has been successful in their respective host cells in vitro. However, many astroviruses still have not been adapted to propagation in vitro for unknown reasons, while others lose infectivity with subsequent passages and therefore cannot be maintained continuously.

ORF1a is 2.8 kb and encodes a polypeptide of approximately 110 kDa. This polypeptide contains a variety of conserved motifs, including several putative transmembrane domains, a bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS), and a serine protease motif. The translated polypeptide is cleaved by both cellular protease(s) and the viral protease into at least five peptides. The actual function of each protein remains largely unknown. The transmembrane domains may localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to facilitate replication, as all plus-strand RNA viruses have been shown to replicate in association with a membrane. One peptide, NSP1a/4, colocalizes with the viral RNA at the ER membrane; mutations in NSP1a correlate with increased viral titers in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a role for this protein in viral replication. The role for the NLS remains unclear; some reports suggest viral antigen is observed in the nucleus, while others find that it is excluded.",

Intensive research has determined that ORF1b is translated bya frameshift into the -1 frame. This frameshifting event is unique among plus-strand animal RNAviruses and requires a highly conserved shifty heptameric sequence (A 6 C) as well as a downstream hairpin structure. This event, which occurs with frequencies up to 25% in cells, results in an ORF1a/ 1b fusion peptide. Cleavage near the 1a/1b border releases the ORF1b gene product: the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Astrovirus polymerase is a supergroup 1 RdRp, a group which generally utilizes a VPg to initiate transcription.

Mammalian astroviruses split more recently into two distinct clades: human astroviruses and feline/mink-associated astroviruses. Phylogenetic clustering of the human astroviruses together argues against continual human-animal interspecies transmission. It is hypothesized that at least two interspecies transmission events (avian to porcine, porcine to feline) led to the current division of viruses. Further comparison of synonymous mutations by codon usage generates an astrovirus evolutionary pattern which mirrors the evolution of respective hosts, suggesting that recent evolution of the virus may have been in adaptation to the host. As RNA viruses, astroviruses are expected to undergo frequent genetic changes. However, nucleotide changes occur at rates of approximately 5% in human viruses over time, despite the co-circulation of muptiple serotypes within a region. Nucleotide and amino acid comparisons of ORF1a of human astroviruses demonstrate two distinct lineages, known as genogroup I (HAstV-1 to -5) and genogroup II (HAstV-6 and -7).

Onset of symptoms at 2-3 days post infection (dpi) correlates with shedding of the virus in feces, although shedding can continue after resolution of other symptoms. Astrovirus infection has also been associated with intussusception, although a causative role has not been established. The earliest studies of astrovirus pathogenesis utilized gnotobiotic sheep and calves as models. In calves, astrovirus infection was localized to the dome epithelial cells overlying Peyer's patches. These cells appeared flat or rounded and released cells were identified in the intestinal lumen. Astrovirus infection in calves was shown to be specifically targeted to M cells and led to the sloughing of necrotic M cells into the intestinal lumen. Enterocytes were never observed to be infected. Specific tropism of the virus for immune cells suggests that astrovirus may have an immunomodulatory role in calves. While the virus replicated in these animals and could be detected in their feces, the calves displayed no clinical signs. In most bovine studies, viral infection is asymptomatic, although changes in the feces from solid and brown to soft and yellow were noted in one study. Mild villus atrophy and slight changes in villus-to-crypt ratios have been noted but no changes in xylose absorption were observed.

            "text": "Turkey astrovirus was the first discovered avian astrovirus and remains the best characterized in terms of pathogenesis, due in part to the development of the turkey as a small animal model. In these animals, virus could be detected from 1 to 12 dpi in the intestines. Viral replication was limited to the enterocytes on the apical portion of the villi, but the virus could be detected throughout the body, including the blood. The development of viremia is rare among enteric viruses and its function remains unclear. Infected turkeys developed a yellow, frothy, gas-filled diarrhea from 1 to 12 dpi. Diarrhea occasionally contained undigested food, but never blood. The intestines of infected birds became thin walled, flaccid, and distended. Despite these changes, histological examination suggested that only mild changes occur during infection. A mild crypt hyperplasia and shortening of the villi were noted from 4 or 5 to 9 dpi, and single degrading enterocytes could be identified. However, TUNEL staining suggested that the amount of cell death in infected intestines is similar to control birds. D-xylose absorption, a measure of intestinal absorption, was significantly decreased from 2 to 5 dpi in one study and up to 13 dpi in another. This effect was exacerbated in the presence of another enteric pathogen, turkey coronavirus. Astrovirus infection also caused a significant growth depression in turkey poults by 5 dpi; infected birds never recovered from this, leading to flock unevenness. Infected birds also demonstrated a transient (3-9 dpi) reduction of the thymus, which returned to normal by 12 dpi.",

Infected birds develop liver hemorrhage, swollen kidneys, and hepatocyte necrosis. On farms, infection leads to mortality rates of 10-25% in adult (4-6-week-old) ducks, but can reach 50% in ducklings under 14 days of age. In chickens, infection with the astrovirus avian nephritis virus (ANV) results in discoloration of the kidney, development of renal lesions, and interstitial nephritis by 3 dpi. Pathogenesis is age dependent, with 1-day-old chicks the most susceptible and adult birds the least. ANV infection can result in mortality rates of up to 33%, although rates appear to be strain specific.",

The biphasic infection pattern of young children and the elderly suggests that antibodies are protective during the middle of life. Indeed, serological studies have indicated that approximately 50% of neonates have maternally acquired antibody to HAstV, which wane by 4-6 months of age. Children then acquire anti-HAstV antibodies rapidly due to astrovirus exposure. By the age of 9, up to 90% of the population has been exposed to HAstV-1. Furthermore, volunteer experiments demonstrate that astrovirus exposure generally leads to an increase in anti-astrovirus antibody titer. While astrovirus antibodies protected individuals from symptoms associated with infection, virus was identified in the feces, suggesting that such antibodies do not necessarily prevent viral replication. Additionally, immunoglobulin treatment has been attempted as a treatment for severe or chronic astrovirus infection. The results have been mixed and difficult to interpret, as the presence of astrovirus-specific antibodies in the immunoglobulin treatment was not always confirmed.",

Studies have demonstrated that most individuals possess HLA-restricted, astrovirus-specific T cells. When stimulated with astrovirus in vitro, these cells produce tumor necrosis factor, interferon gamma, and occasionally interleukin (IL)-5 but not IL-2 or IL-4. These cytokines are typical of the T-helper-type response thought to be important in controlling viral infections. Individuals deficient in T and B-cell functions are unable to control infection, shedding virus to very high titers (!10 14 particles ml \u00c01 ) and for extended periods of time (up to 18 months), further supporting the importance of cellular immunity.",

In this model, no increase in T cells (CD4 \u00fe or CD8 \u00fe ) could be demonstrated after TAstV-2 infection. Moreover, while infected turkeys produced a slight increase in antibody production, these antibodies were not neutralizing and did not prevent against future infection. However, it was noted that macrophages from TAstV-2 infected turkeys produced significantly higher levels of nitric oxide (NO) both in vivo and upon stimulation ex vivo. Inhibition of NO in vivo led to a significant increase in viral production, while addition of exogenous NO decreased viral production to below the detection limit, suggesting that NO is an important factor in controlling astrovirus infection. The importance of macrophages and their role in astrovirus infection has been corroborated by observations in astrovirusinfected lambs, where EM showed virions within macrophages. Furthermore, it is possible that astroviruses have a mechanism to combat this response, as macrophages in astrovirus-infected turkeys demonstrate a reduced ability to phagocytose.",

This can often be accomplished at home; thus, hospital admittance is rare. No vaccine is yet available for humans, and as noted above, immunoglobulin treatment for immunocompromised individuals has been met with varying degrees of success. Additionally, no treatment for astrovirus-infected animals exists. The best solution, therefore, is prevention of transmission, which is best done in humans by conscientious hand and food washing. The stability of astroviruses and their resistance to inactivation make them difficult to eliminate after introduction. This is a significant problem in hospitals, where individuals are generally immunocompromised and therefore more susceptible to infection. One outbreak in a bone marrow transplant ward prompted the hospital to scrub the entire ward with warm, soapy water. However, surveillance of the subsequent inhabitants demonstrated fecal shedding of astroviruses, underscoring the difficulty in removing the virus. This is also a significant problem in commercial farming, where astrovirus infection of animals significantly decreases productivity. Its introduction and maintenance in this environment can mean drastic financial losses. In each of these environments, early detection and thorough disinfection are keys to limiting transmission and controlling infection.",
