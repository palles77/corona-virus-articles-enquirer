            "text": "The component tissues of the eye are both individually and collectively unique and fascinating to both clinician and researcher. We find in a single organ a variety of complex tissues each with its own particular vascular relationships, from the avascular cornea and lens to the extensively vascularized uvea. Charac teristic biochemical features of the tissues exist as well, including the endothelial pump of the cornea, the anaerobic glycolytic pathway of the lens, and the poorly defined transport systems of aqueous humor production and outflow. Besides the dynamic aqueous, we find the most substantial tissue of the eye, the vitreous humor, to be apparently a relatively stagnant blob of hydrated connective tissue whose physiology is still largely a mystery. The neurologic control mechanisms of such diverse processes as pupillary size, accommodation, and probably aque ous humor inflow and outflow add another dimension of potential inquiry. The eye is devoid of lymphatics, and the nature of its tissues further contributes to its immunologie uniqueness. The retina incorporates all the complexities of neuroperception and transmission. Nowhere else in the body are such diverse structure and function so intimately and intricately related.",

While the majority of investigations have had as their objective ultimate correlation with normal and abnormal function and structure of the human eye, laboratory studies have provided an abundance of comparative information that emphasizes that while there are numerous and amazing similarities in the peripheral visual system among the vertebrate (and even the invertebrate) animals, significant differences exist that are important to both researcher and clinician in selection of a research model and in extrapolation of data obtained from one species to another, and even among different species subdivisions.",

For example, some are more effective in producing stromal keratidities as compared to the epithelial condition (Metcalf et al., 1976) . Con comitant in importance may be the route of inoculation. In some studies viral suspensions are placed into the conjunctival sac (Nesburn and Ziniti, 1971) , while in others they are dropped onto the cornea . Corneal preparation may be important; for example, some studies have employed chalazion currette (Stern and Stock, 1978) , while others have employed spatula scrap ing or circular trephine defects (Kaufman and Maloney, 1961) . Deep inoculations are required to produce a stromal keratitis (Fig. 1) , while the epithelial disease may be induced through shallow scratches (Polli koff et al., 1972) . The rabbit appears to be the species of choice for bacterial keratitis, although Davis et al. (1978) feel that the guinea pig is of equal value. In one study an inbred animal was used (strain 13) to reduce the inherent variability seen in some of these experiments (Davis and Chandler, 1975) . Whether or not the rabbit model has any specific biologic advantage, the guinea pig would appear to be more feasible because of its smaller size, ease of handling, ease to anesthetize, cost of purchase and maintenance, and, perhaps most significantly, resistance to spontaneous Pasteur ella conjunctivitis, which frequently occurs in laboratory rabbits. Methods of bacterial inoculation usually involve an intracorneal injec tion using a microsyringe and small volumes of quantitated microorganisms.",

If a topical drug is to be effective intraocularly it must traverse the hydrophobic epithelial layer and the hydrophilic corneal stroma; ideally, then, it should exist in an equilibrium between ionized and unionized forms with biphasic solubility characteristics. Thus, both chemical configuration and pH of the vehicle are important. Other important limitations are the small tear volume and rapid clearance of drugs from the tear film (Janes and Stiles, 1963) . Rabbits tend to blink infrequently; consequently corneal contact time is prolonged com pared to humans. Most nonprimate mammals possess a nictitating membrane which may affect tear dynamics. Drugs may be applied with an ointment vehicle to prolong contact time, but bioavailability may be affected. Finally, the position of the animal may be important. A tenfold difference in aqueous drug levels in rabbits has been reported depending on whether the animal was upright or re cumbent during the experiment (Sieg and Robinson, 1974) .",

Subconjunctival injection may be given in two ways; by (1) injecting directly through the bulbar conjunctiva or (2) by inserting the needle through the skin of the lids, leaving the conjunctiva intact. The method of injection may be very important; one study showed that in rabbits leakage of hydrocortisone back through the injection site into the tear film ac counted for most of the intraocular absorption (Wine et al., 1964) . Although numerous articles have been written on the kinetics of drug absorption after subconjunctival injection (Baum, 1977) , the subject is still controversial, and recent evidence presented by Maurice and Ota (1978) indicates that absorption into the anterior chamber by this route may be much lower in rabbits than in man.

Perlman and Baum (1974) have used Stacker's method to isolate endothelial cells from rabbits and have had good success in maintaining large endothelial cell cultures for several months using a modified Eagle's MEM supplemented with calf serum, bicarbo nate, glutamine, and kanamycin sulfate. Most exciting are the reports of using tissue cultured endothelial cells, seeded on to donor corneas with endothelium removed, for transplantation in rabbits (Jumblatt et al., 1978) .",

            "text": "The eye is unique in that it is devoid of lymphatics and thus has no directly associated lymph nodes. Classic animal studies have been utilized to define ocu lar mechanisms of immune response and have demonstrated that the uveal and limbal tissues play a role similar to that of secondary lymphoid tissue elsewhere in the body. Bursuk (1928) injected typhoid bacilli and staphylococci into the cornea of rabbits and found that agglutinins and opsonins appeared in the corneal tissues earlier and in greater concentration than in the serum, suggesting local respon siveness. Thompson and co-workers (1936) obtained identical results using crys talline egg albumin as the antigen, and further showed that when only one cornea of each animal was injected precipitating antibody could not be detected in the contralateral uninjected cornea. Rabbit experiments in which ovalbumin was injected into the right cornea and human serum albumin was injected into the left cornea demonstrated that the respective cornea contained antibodies only to the antigen they had received and not to the antigen present in the contralateral cornea; specific antigen was detectable within 8 days (Thompson and Olsen, 1950) . Using a'fluorescent antibody technique, Witmer (1955) demonstrated immunoglobulin cells in the uvea of the rabbit, and Wolkowicz et al. (1960) showed that excised, sensitized uveal tissue in short-term culture would actively produce specific antibody. Lymphoid cells migrate to the eye in the presence of antigenic stimulus. Thus, x irradiation of the eyes of a rabbit does not impair the ability of either the limbal tissues or the uvea to form antibody, whereas irradiation of the peripheral lym phoid system does (Thompson and Harrison, 1954; Silverstein, 1964) . When the primary ocular response to an antigenic challenge has subsided, sensitized 4 'memory\" lymphocytes may persist in the uvea or limbal tissues, since a later exposure to the same antigen introduced at a distant site or injected directly into the circulation results in renewed antibody production within the eye (Pribnow and Hall, 1970; Silverstein, 1964) .",

The thin cornea and shallow anterior chamber have contributed to technical difficulties in performing intraocular lens implantation and penetrating keratoplasty in rabbits (Mueller, 1964) . The corneal epithelium is also thin in rabbits, and the existence of Bowman's layer in the rabbit has been disputed (Prince, 1964b) .",

In these animals, as in man, remaining endothelial cells grow and spread to cover the defect (Van Horn, 1975) .

Concepts of aqueous humor formation are based largely upon laboratory work with the rabbit. Aqueous humor is produced by the ciliary processes as a result of active transport and passive ultrafiltration processes; approximately one-half of the aqueous is produced by active secretion across the two-layered epithelium. The exact mechanisms of transport have not been de-fined and may demonstrate species differences; active transport of sodium in the presence of a sodium-and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase located in the cell membrane of the nonpigmented epithelium is one of the main primary events in the formation of the aqueous fluid (Cole, 1974) . The remaining 50% of aqueous humor is formed by passive processes, including diffusion, dialysis, and ultrafiltration. The composition of aqueous humor is essentially that of a plasma ultrafiltrate but varies between species. Gaasterland et al. (1979) have studied the composition of rhesus monkey aqueous. Differences between aqueous and plasma levels of potassium, magnesium, chloride, and bicarbonate have been demonstrated and suggest species differences in transport mechanisms and/or anterior segment metabolism. A saturable active transport system for ascorbate has been documented in the rabbit (Barany and Langham, 1955) . Transport mechanisms for amino acids demonstrated in the rabbit may not be present in rat, cat, monkey, and dog (Reddy, 1967) . Total volume of the aqueous humor will vary among species with the size of the globe and relative proportions of the anterior segment (Cole, 1974) .",

The principle of the test may be traced to the massage effect, whereby pressure on the eye leads to a softening of the globe due to increased outflow. Schiotz indentation tonography employs placement of an electronically recording Schiotz tonometer on the eye; the weight of the tonome ter will indent the cornea, reducing ocular volume and increasing IOP. The instrument is left on the cornea for a 4-minute period. Tables are utilized to derive the rate of aqueous humor outflow based upon the observed changes in IOP over the 4-minute period as recorded by the tonograph (Grant, 1950; Kronfeld 1952 Kronfeld , 1961 Garner, 1965; Drews, 1971; Podos and Becker, 1973) .",

Facil ity may be calculated at any given pressure utilizing the formula C = FIP, where F is the rate of perfusion flow in microliters of mercury per minute, P is the intraocular pressure in millimeters of mercury, and C is facility expressed in microliters of fluid per millimeter of mercury per minute. In an in vivo system, however, this equation does not consider aqueous humor production and thus provides values lower than actual facility.

Melton and DeVille (1960) studied enucleated canine eyes using constant pressure perfusion and found an average C value of 0.28 at 28 mm Hg IOP. Peiffer and his associates (1976) found the facility of outflow in normal dogs anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital to have a mean value of 0.13 \u00b1 0.07 SD which increased as IOP increased. Perfusion values for outflow were less than those determined tonographically (0.21 \u00b1 0.14 SD with acetylpromazineketamine hydrocholoride sedation, 0.15 \u00b1 0.09 SD with pentobarbital anes thesia) or in the enucleated globe.

Outflow increased significantly during perfusion with hyaluronidase-containing solution and with time in the non-hyaluronidase-perfused eyes. Peiffer et al.

The limitations of tonographic and perfusion techniques to quantitate aqueous humor outflow in animal species must be appreciated; neither is ideal.

A number of physiologic variables may affect the IOP. These include the nature of the subject, the time of day, and the position of the subject. Intraocular pressure is related to blood pressure, and it has been demon strated that animals that are excited will have higher IOP. Accurate values are obtained in animals that have been handled and previously subjected to the technique. In persons, a diurnal variation of IOP has been observed with the lowest IOP occurring early in the morning. This variation is probably related to changes in endogenous corticosteriod levels. Diurnal variation has been demon strated in the New Zealand white rabbit (Katz et al., 1975) and in beagles with inherited glaucoma, but not in normal dogs (Gelatt et al., 1979a) . In persons significant differences in IOP are observed with the patient in a sitting position as compared to the prone position. In addition, the variable of technique may contribute to the wide range of normal intraocular pressures observed in animals. Sedation and anesthesia, because of associated cardiovascular effects, are likely to affect IOP. This is especially true of the barbiturates. Bito and co-workers (1979) found that ketamine hydrochloride had minimal effect on IOP of rhesus monkeys (Mucaca mulatta) and reported a mean IOP of 14.1 \u00b1 2.1 SD with higher values and a greater diurnal variation in young animals.",

Rabbit tonometry is facilitated with an assistant holding the animal in lateral recumbancy. The animal should be relaxed, and care should be taken not to compress the jugular veins. The first, second, and/or third fingers of the left hand or the thumb may be used to simultaneously retract the lower eyelid of the right or left eyes, respectively. The tonometer is grasped between the thumb and first finger of the right hand and the tonometer scale rotated such that it is easily observed by the examiner. The fourth finger of the right hand is rested on the frontal bone to provide stability and retract the upper eyelid. Care must be taken in retracting the lids so that pressure is applied only to the bony orbital rim and not the globe itself. Excessive eyelid retraction may also create abnormal forces on the globe and should be avoided. The footplate is placed on the cornea as central as possible and gentle pressure applied until the holding bracket glides freely around the footplate shaft (Fig.  20) . The scale reading is noted, and the tonometer is removed. The procedure is repeated two more times; each scale readings should be within one full unit to another. If the readings are to the low end of the scale, additional weights may be applied to the tonometer and the procedure repeated to obtain midscale readings. One potential source of error is the position of the tonometer in relationship to the perpendicular; deviation from the perpendicular will result in an overestimation of IOP directly proportional to the degree of deviation. The process of tonometry will induce an increase in aqueous humor outflow and each repeated measure ment may be slightly lower than the previous estimate of IOP.",

            "text": "Buphthalmia (hydrophthalmus, congenital infantile glaucoma) in rabbits is due to an autosomal recessive gene with incomplete prentrance (Hanna et al., 1962) . Histologie abnormalities of the eye are observed at birth; elevated IOP and buphthalmus may be observed as early as 2 to 3 weeks of age in some animals with progressive clouding and flattening of the cornea; ectasia of the globe, particularly in the sclero-cornea region; deepening of the anterior chamber with detachment and fragmentation of the iris membrane; partial atrophy of the ciliary body; and glaucomatous excavation of the optic disk (Hanna et al., 1962) . The primary defect responsible for the development of glaucoma probably in volves impairment of facility of outflow. It has been postulated that the glaucoma may be part of a primary systemic disorder (Hanna et al., 1962) . The gross ocular enlargement which characterizes buphthalmia is accompanied by fibrosis of the filtering angle (McMaster and Macri, 1967) , a decrease in facility of aqueous humor outflow (McMaster, 1960; Kolker et al., 1963) , and a hyposecretion of aqueous humor (Smith, 1944; Auricchio and Wistrand, 1959; McMaster and Macri, 1967; Greaves and Perkins, 1951) . Anatomic studies have em phasized changes at the angle and have postulated that they constitute at least one site of obstruction to aqueous humor outflow. Hanna et al. (1962) demonstrate an absence of the space of Fontana, the iris pillars, and either total absence or a rudimentary development of the trabecular canals and intrascleral channels. McMaster and Macri (1967) observed that the obstruction to outflow lies be tween the trabeculum and the episcleral veins. The angle according to Hanna et al. (1962) is open in the adult buphthalmia but appears closed in the newborn. The combination of hyposecretion and reduced outflow explains why buphthalmic rabbits may have a normal IOP. Rabbits that are genetically buphthalmic but phenotypically normal appear to have an IOP approximately 5 mm Hg higher than normal, and rabbits with clinical signs of buphthalmia may have IOP as high as 50 mm Hg greater. The IOP tends to increase a few weeks prior to observable distention of the globe. Elevated IOP will subsequently return to normal levels. The cause and effect relationship of the striking inverse correlation of aqueous humor ascorbate concentration with the severity of the buphthalmia is not clear; a marked drop in ascorbate levels is present in early preclinical stages of buphthalmia (Lam et al., 1976; Fox et al., 1977; Lee et al., 1978) . The actual sequence of events, involving alterations in IOP, outflow facility, ascorbate concentration of the aqueous humor, and clinical signs are not clearly defined. The rate of progression has been shown to vary with the genetic background. Sheppard et al. (1967) reported that the corneal endothelial cells in a flat preparation from a buphthalmic rabbit were enlarged and of variable size. He postulated that the cells expand to cover the increased corneal area. Van Horn et al. (1977) utilized scanning electron microscopy to confirm this report, but also indicated that there is a loss of endothelial cells in the disease as well. Gelati (1972) published a report on a familial glaucoma in the beagle; pathologic increases in IOP occurred from 9 months to 4 years of age, and affected dogs demonstrated open iridocorneal angles upon gonioscopy.",

Controlled breedings suggested an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. The glaucomatous process was divided into early (6 to 21 months of age), moderate (13 to 30 months of age), and advanced (31 months of age and greater) and was evaluated clinically by tonometry, gonioscopy, and anterior and posterior segment examination. In early glaucoma, the iridocorneal angle was open and without anomalies, and IOP was elevated. With moderate glaucoma, variable optic disc atrophy, elongation of the ciliary processes, and focal disin sertion of the zonules from the lens were seen in addition to elevated IOP and open iridocorneal angles. Advanced glaucoma was characterized by increased IOP, narrow to closed iridocorneal angles, lens dislocation, optic atrophy, and progression to phthisis bulbus. Scanning electron microscopy was performed in a small number of dogs and correlated with the gonioscopy observations. Affected dogs responded positively to water provocation (Gelatt et al., 1976a) and dem onstrated decreased facility of aqueous humor outflow at all stages of the glaucomatous process when compared to normal dogs, both tonographically (Gelatt et al., 1977c) and by constant pressure perfusion (Peiffer et al., 1980b) . Responses to topical autonomie agents Whitley et al., 1980) and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (Gelatt et al., 1978) have been studied, and histochemical studies of adrenergic and cholinergic receptor sites have been performed (Gwin et al., 1979a) . Peiffer and Gelatt (1980) described gross and light microscopic observations of the iridocorneal angle; data sup ported gonioscopic observations that the disease appeared to be an open angle glaucoma, with secondary pathology of the angle structures noted.",

Franklin and Pendergrast (1972) observed that allogeneic thyroidal implants were rejected by the rabbit eye in a histologie manner and chronologic sequence similar to that for implants to other parts of the body. Kaplan and his associates (1975; Kaplan and Streilein, 1977) have reported that although the rejection of allogeneic implants placed in the anterior chamber of inbred rats is delayed, the immunologie recog nition via the afferent limb of the immune response is intact. Since ocular implant vascularization is coincident with that of implants in other areas of the body, immunologie suppression is probably responsible for the delay in the transplanta tion rejection observed (Raju and Grogan, 1969) . In studies of anterior chamber immunization, Kaplan and Streilein (1978) have demonstrated that the allogeneic antigens present in the anterior chamber are processed immunologically by the spleen via a vascular route, since afferent lymphatic channels do not drain the anterior chamber. They suggest that immune deviation occurs as a result of splenic suppressor factors which delay anterior chamber graft rejection. Work by Vessela and his co-workers (1978) in the rat has supported this theory. Their model suggests that antigen processing and recognition occur, but that effector response is delayed. A possible delay mechanism could be low dose antigen sensitization with tolerance because of the lack of lymphatics, but a more likely explanation would be the presence of suppressor factors including nonspecific serologie blocking factors, specific antigen-antibody blocking complexes, sup pressor macrophages, or suppressor T cells.",

Earlier studies dealt with the identification of uveal antigens; bilat eral uveitis can be produced by homologous immunization (Aronson, 1968) . The inflammation tends to be nongranulomatous; however, occasional reports (Col lins, 1949 (Col lins, , 1953 describe lesions histopathologically similar to the granulomatous process seen in human sympathetic ophthalmitis. Vannas et al. (1960) pro duced experimental uveitis in rabbits by enucleating one eye and implanting it in the peritoneal cavity. Aronson and co-workers (1963a,b,c) demonstrated that uveal preparations from albino guinea pigs are antigenic, suggesting that melanin is not a vital antigenic component of the disease process. A number of workers have demonstrated that antigens from the rod outer segments and retinal pigment epithelium can induce experimental allergic uveitis in primates, guinea pigs, and rabbits (Wong et al., 1975; Meyers and Pettit, 1975; Hempel et al., 1976) . While previous workers had demonstrated that crude extracts of uveal tissue can also produce EAU, Faure et al. (1977) have suggested that the activity observed with these uveal preparations was probably due to contamination by retinal antigens, and most investigators accept their hypothesis that retinal antigens are more important than uveal antigens in EAU. Wacker (1973) and Wacker and his associates (1977) have demonstrated that antigens present in the photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelial layers can elicit the development of chorioretinitis and have partially characterized the responsible antigens. There is a soluble antigen (S antigen) located throughout the photoreceptor layer. This S antigen is most active in the production of EAU; animals with the disease often develop delayed hypersensitivity responses to it. The S antigen appears biochemically similar to a protein subunit of retinolbinding lipoglycoprotein present throughout the photoreceptor layer. S antigen is apparently tissue-specific; crude bovine S antigen was relatively ineffective in the induction of guinea pig EAU. A more purified preparation, however, resulted in a histopathologic lesion, with cellular infiltration in the anterior uvea and destruction of the photoreceptor layer. Thus a purified extract of zenogeneic antigenic material had characteristics similar to those of the tissue-specific allogeneic extract. The S antigen is probably not rhodopsin, since a number of physical characteristics, including solubility, molecular weight, amino acid se quence, specific location, and the absorption spectrum, are different. The authors also identified a particulate antigen (P antigen), located in the rod outer seg ments, that does not elicit a delayed hypersensitivity response and has a lower EAU induction rate. It does elicit the development of antibodies, even in the absence of disease.",

Meyers and Pettit (1975) demonstrated in the guinea pig both cutaneous de layed hypersensitivity and macrophage migration inhibition reactions toward rod outer segments and retinal pigment epithelial antigens in EAU.

Other experiments in rats previously sensitized with whole lens preparations showed that intraocular challenge with albuminoid evokes a cellular response consisting initially of neutrophils followed by macrophages whereas crystallins, particularly a-crystallin, give rise to round cell exudation (Behrens and Manski, 1973b) . These findings suggest that the soluble antigens are responsible for humoral antibody formation and that insoluble albuminoid accounts for cell-mediated responses. M\u00fcller (1963) has drawn attention to the enhancing effect of previous sensitization on the uveal response to lens proteins, having found that injection of homologous lens tissue in the presence of Freund's adjuvant some time before needling the lens gives rise to a uveitis of marked proportions. Marak and his associates (1976) have demonstrated that ELGU can be transferred with serum. Immunofluorescent studies of traumatized lenses of sensitized animals have demonstrated the presence of IgG and complement, components of an immune complex-mediated reaction. Depletion of the third component of complement using cobra venom factor or anti-leukocyte serum to inactivate polymorphonuclear lymphocytes (PMNs) decreased the incidence of ELGU. While it is most likely that ELGU is an immune complex disease, immune complexes in the serum or aqueous of experimental animals have not been demonstrated. Carmichael et al. (1974) reproduced the uveitis that accompanied infectious canine hepatitis adenovirus infection or vaccination demonstrating an immune complex disease resulting form soluble virus-antibody complexes and the asso ciated PMN cell response.",

Genetic influences can markedly alter immune responses; in congenic animals which differ only in the region of the chromosome containing immune response (Ir) genes, marked differences in the incidence of autoimmune disease, malignancy, and infections have been noted, and it is possible that genetically determined differences in immunologie reactiv ity may be important in the development of uveitis in both humans and animals. There is a paucity of data using experimental animal models to determine the importance of immune response genes in the development of uveitis. In guinea pigs, the incidence of uveitis differs markedly between different strains. While it is relatively easy to induce uveitis in the Hartley or NIH strains, it is slightly more difficult to induce it in strain 13 and almost impossible to induce it in strain 2 (McMaster et al., 1976) . Mice that have well-characterized histocompatibility and immune response gene systems are a potential model to further study this phenomenon. (Silverstein, 1964; Hall and O'Connor, 1970) . Is there a specific immunologie reaction by these cells toward uveal antigens that is important in the production of human endogenous uveitis, or is the reactivity observed merely as an epiphenomenon? An equally feasible mechanism for the prolongation of an ocular inflammatory response could be the structural alteration induced by a nonspecific immunologie reaction. In the rabbit the development of systemic immune complex disease, with nonocular antigens, results in a change in ocular vascular permeability (Gamble et al., 1970 Howes and McKay, 1975) . It is conceivable that, once an animal receives this type of insult to its vascular system, the structural alteration of the ocular tissue is such that a chronic uveitis either develops or continues despite the lack of specific immune reactivity toward ocular antigens.",

Also, the human lens tends to maintain its water content at about 65%, while lower animals have a decrease in water content during old age.

In general, antibodies to the lens of one species will show extensive cross-reactivity to lens proteins of species lower on the evolutionary scale, indicating that these antigens have been carried over as evolution has progressed.

Radiation cataracts have been studied in many different laboratory animals, most of which make satisfactory models with the exception of the bird which seems to be resistant to radiation cataract (Pirie, 1961) . The lenses of younger animals are generally more susceptible to radiation, and the periphery of the lens which contains the actively dividing cells is much more sensitive than the nucleus (Pirie and Flanders, 1957) (Fig. 21 ). X rays, y rays, and neutrons are all potent cataractogens. Beta radiation in sufficient doses can also be used to cause cataracts (von Sallmann et al., 1953) . Much of the early work on ocular effects of ionizing radiation is reviewed by Duke-Elder (1954) .",

Animal selection should consider size and shape of the anterior chamber, pupil, and lens as well as species-related reactivity to surgery and lens implantation. In general, nonprimate mammals respond to intraocular manipula tions with increased exudation and inflammation compared to primates and hu mans. Sampson (1956) implanted Ridley-type lenses in nine dogs undergoing cataract extraction. Schillinger et al. (1958) reported disappointing results with crude lenses implanted in rabbit and dog eyes. Eifrig and Doughman (1977) used modern iris fixation lenses in rabbits (Fig. 22) . Rabbits were prone to develop corneal edema after lens extraction with or without lens implantation, but edema was prolonged in eyes receiving lenses. Cats have been used for implantation of lenses with slightly less technical difficulty than rabbits, but their vertical slit pupil is not ideal. Because of their large anterior chamber, cats are not suitable for implantation of standard-sized anterior chamber lenses.",

(1978) used Fisher 344 albino rats exposed to a high-intensity fluorescent light to produce a severe peripheral retinal degeneration. A continuous highintensity fluorescent light exposure regimen for albino and hooded rats produced a more severe photoreceptor cell degeneration in the former (Reuter and Hobbelen, 1977). Low-intensity continuous colored lights disclosed that white and blue bulbs produced the most damage in adult albino rats . It is apparent that continuous light sources are the most damaging to the albino animal, the higher the intensity the more severe the degeneration. Newborn albino species, however, will show initial outer segment growth before damage eventually occurs (Kuwabara and Funahashi, 1976) . In 1973, Berso evaluated the 13-striped ground squirrel, which has an all-cone retina, under high intensity illumination.

Under low levels of cyclic illumination (1.5-2 ft-c) both rhodopsin and opsin levels decreased, the latter requiring a longer period of time. In addition it was determined that rod cells degenerated before the cone cells. In another experiment, autoradiographic techniques were used to assess the influence of vitamin A deficiency on the removal of rod outer segments in weanling albino rats (Herron and Riegel, 1974) . The process was distinctly retarded by the absence of the vitamin. In a combination study, Robison et al. (1979) evaluated the effects of relative deficiencies of vitamin A and E in rats. Autofluorescent and histochemical techniques revealed that the vitamin E-free diets produced significant increases in fluorescence and lipofucsin granule stain ing regardless of the vitamin A levels.

This enables the clinical assessment of visual function in the area centralis as compared to the peripheral retina by measuring potential changes in the visual cortex in response to focal or diffuse retinal stimulation. The techniques described for the cat are also applicable to other species. Autoradiography has been available and successfully used in ophthalmologic research for several years (Cowan et al. y 1972) . Tritiated amino acids are readily available in various concentrations and forms and may be injected into the vitreous or other ocular tissues where they may become imcorporated into cellu lar protein metabolism pathways. Distribution may be studied by light or electron microscopy. Ogden (1974) utilized the concept of axoplasmic transport together with autoradiography to trace the course of peripheral retinal nerve fibers to the optic disc. Others have utilized this technique to study outer segment photopigment metabolism. Rods have been shown to regenerate photopigment discs con tinuously with the RPE participating in the process by phagocytizing the shed products. (Young, 1970; Norton et al., 1974; Mandelcorn et al., 1975) . Cones also have mechanisms for photopigment renewal.

In higher primates, including man, both the uveal and retinal vessels are branches of the ophthalmic artery, itself a branch of the internal carotid; the external carotid system contributes very little to the ocular blood supply. In lower animals, on the other hand, the external carotid system, by way of the external ophthalmic artery, supplies the major portion of blood to the eye. Many animals, including the dog, cat, and rat (but not the rabbit), have a strong anastomosing ramus between the external ophthalmic artery and the circle of Willis, and since a relatively large part of their cerebral blood supply comes from the vertebral arteries, the common carotid artery may often be totally occluded with no apparent ill effects to the eye (Jewell, 1952) .",

Corrosion casting techniques, involving infu-sion of the eye with neoprene (Prince, l'964b) or plastic resin followed by digestion of the tissues, usually with concentrated sodium hydroxide, have been used for study of the uveal circulation and less often the retinal circulation. In our laboratory corrosion casting with a special low-viscosity plastic has been used with excellent results to study both the anterior and posterior uveal as well as the retinal circulation in cats and monkeys (Risco and Noapanitaya, 1980) . Castings are studied with the scanning electron microscope (Fig. 32) . The retina, because it is thin and relatively transparent, is amenable to simpler studies of vascular morphology. The classic text on this subject is by Michaelson (1954) , who based his observations primarily on flat mounts of retina perfused with India ink. Other dyes have been utilized in a similar fashion (Prince, 1964b) . Another popular technique introduced byKuwabara and Cogan (1960) involves digestion of the retina in 3% trypsin at 37\u00b0C for 1-3 hours until the tissue shows signs of disintegration followed by careful cleaning away of the partially digested tissue from the vascular tree and then staining with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). Other investigators believe that trypsin digestion may destroy some of the more delicate or immature vessels and advocate PAS staining alone to delineate retinal vessels in immature retina (Engerman, 1976a,b; Henkind, et al., 1975) .",

The most widely used in vivo technique is fluorescein angiography. Fluorescein dye is excited by blue light with a wavelength of 490 mm, emitting a yellow-green light with a wavelength of 520 mm. The blood vessels of the retina and iris are relatively impermeable to fluorescein because of their endothelial tight junctions. Thus fluorescein angiography has been useful not only in the study of normal anatomy and time sequence of blood flow in these vessels as demonstrated by the excellent studies in the monkey by Hayreh (1969; Hayreh and Baines, 1972a,b) but also as a test of integrity of the blood-ocular barrier in certain pathological states, especially neovascular lesions. The diffusion of fluorescein across the blood ocular barrier can be assessed quantitatively by fluorophotometric techniques (Cunha-Vaz, 1979) . There is evidence that, in mammals at least, the blood ocular barriers are similar for different species (Rodriguez-Peralta, 1975) .",

This concept was supported by the isolation of a diffusable factor from certain tumors which stimulated neovascularity (Folkman et al., 1971) . Ryu and Albert (1979) demonstrated a variable nonspecific neovascular response to viable or nonviable melanoma or retinoblastoma cells in a rabbit corneal model. The response was negligible in immune-deficient animals. More recently experiments by Federman et al.

The disease can be induced in newborn puppies, kittens, rats, and mice by exposure to high oxygen concentrations because these animals have an immature incompletely vascularized retina at birth. The kitten has been the most popular animal model for RLF, but the changes seen are comparable only to the early stages of RLF in humans with severe extraretinal disease complicated by retinal detachment being a rare finding in any of the animal models.

Most of the early embolization experiments were limited by the fact that the particulate material was injected into the carotid artery, thus indiscriminately embolizing small vessels throughout the eye (Reinecke et al., 1962; Hollenhorst et al., 1962; Ashton and Henkind, 1965) . More recent reports describe tech niques for selective embolization of the choroidal and retinal circulations based on injection site (Kloti, 1967) or temporary occlusion of the retinal circulation during injection (Stern and Ernest, 1974) . The most selective occlusion of retinal vessels has been accomplished with photocoagulation using the argon laser (Hamilton et al., 1975) or xenon photocoagulator (Ernest and Archer, 1979) .",

Albert and his associates (1967) had earlier described similar observations in hamsters injected subcutaneously with tissue-cultured ocular cells lines exposed to the virus. Muaki and Kobayashi (1973) produced extraocular orbital tumors in 12 of 59 newborn hamsters 27 to 106 days following intravitreal injection of the same virus; the tumors resembled a neuroepithelioma, suggesting that they were derived from neurogenic primordia in the retrobulbar space. Further investigations demon strated the retinoblastoma in mice (Muaki et al., 1977) . JC polyoma virus was injected into the eyes of newborn hamsters by Ohashi and his associates (1978); 20% of the animals developed retinoblastoma-or ependymoblastoma-like intraocular tumors 7 Vi-\\?> months postinjection. Eleven percent developed extraocular tumors, including schwannomas, fibrosarcomas, lacrimai gland carcinomas, and ependymal tumors.",
