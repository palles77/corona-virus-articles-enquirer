When these proteins oligomerize in host cell membranes, they form hydrophilic pores that disrupt a number of physiological properties of the cell. Viroporins are crucial for viral pathogenicity owing to their involvement in several diverse steps of the viral life cycle. Thus, these viral proteins, which include influenza A virus matrix protein 2 (M2), HIV-1 viral protein U (Vpu) and hepatitis C virus p7, represent ideal targets for therapeutic intervention, and several compounds that block their pore-forming activity have been identified. Here, we review recent studies in the field that have advanced our knowledge of the structure and function of this expanding family of viral proteins.",

Over the past decade, an expanding viral protein family has become the subject of much interest owing to its central role in the viral life cycle. These proteins, termed viroporins, are involved in viral genome replication and assembly, as well as virus particle entry into and release from infected cells. The functional activities of these proteins also have a profound impact on the host cell, disrupting a number of important physiological processes. Viroporins are encoded by a range of animal viruses of clinical interest, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV-1, influenza A virus (IAV), coronaviruses, picornaviruses such as poliovirus, and togaviruses [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] .",

In general terms, their main function is participation in the assembly of virus particles and their release from infected cells 2 . Typically, deletion of a viroporin-encoding gene from a viral genome drastically diminishes the formation of viral progeny and viral pathogenicity, underscoring the essential role of these proteins in the viral life cycle 2 .",

            "text": "Over the past few years, substantial advances have been made in our understanding of viroporin architecture. Current hypotheses suggest that viroporins form aqueous channels following insertion into the host cell membrane and subsequent oligomerization. We propose that viroporins be classified into two major groups, class I and class II, depending on whether they contain one or two transmembrane (TM) domains, respectively (FIG. 1) . These classes can be further divided into subgroups according to membrane topology. Class IA viroporins contain a small (9-25 amino acids) domain at the amino terminus, which resides in the ER lumen, and a long cytosolic tail (~50 amino acids) at the carboxyl terminus, which is prone to phosphorylation 18, 35 . The class IB viroporins contain a short N terminus that is found in the cytosol and a long C-terminal tail that is located in the ER lumen. Class II viroporins have two TM domains that are connected by a loop of basic amino acids. The N and C termini of class IIA viroporins both face the ER lumen, whereas in class IIB viroporins the opposite orientation is adopted, with both termini located in the cytosol. Class II viroporins are usually derived from larger precursors by proteolytic processing 2 , and both termini form part of the peptidase cleavage site. A putative third class of viroporins, for those that contain three hydrophobic domains, has been proposed; this class would include the coronavirus protein 3a 36 , but further investigation is required to confirm that this protein is a genuine viroporin. Viruses that are deficient in viroporins can be rescued in trans by their own viroporin and, in some instances, can be partially rescued by other, unrelated viroporins, although opposing results have been reported, probably owing to differences in the experimental approaches used 32, 37, 38 . However, in general, the interchange of viroporins between different species of animal viruses fails to completely rescue viral replication 38 , supporting the idea that these proteins interact in a specific manner with other viral or cellular proteins. In some instances, chimeric viroporins can promote viral release; for example, the TM domain of HIV-1 Vpu can be functionally substituted by the corresponding domain of IAV M2 (REF. 39 ).",

Similarly, HIV-1 Vpu oligomers can function as ionconducting channels 50 that open in a voltage-dependent or voltage-independent manner 51 . When expressed in bacteria and mammalian cells, these proteins also induce a certain degree of membrane permeabilization to small solutes 52, 53 .

Viroporin activity is probably regulated by differences in the components and structures of organellar and plasma membrane lipid bilayers 48, 57 .

The last step in the maturation of enveloped viruses is the budding of virus particles from the plasma membrane (for IAV, togaviruses and lentiviruses) or from intracellular vesicles (for flavi viruses and corona viruses). In the case of both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, the insertion of viroporins in the membrane leads to the dissipation of membrane potential. We propose that viroporin insertion breaks the chemoelectrical barrier by conducting ions across membranes, thus dissipating the membrane potential of the plasma membrane or of internal vesicles and thereby stimulating budding 21 (FIG. 3) . Therefore, in enveloped viruses, the dissipation of membrane potential can be coupled to viral release. In the process of budding, membrane fission begins with the formation of a membrane neck, which is followed by self-merging of the inner monolayer of the neck. Subsequent self-merging of the outer monolayer of the neck results in the virus particle pinching off from the plasma or vesicle membrane. Membrane depolarization is accompanied by a reduction in the surface charge density of the membrane, and it has been argued that this reduces the repulsion between contacting monolayers and therefore enhances the contacts that are required for fission 75 (FIG. 3) . In this manner, the production of viruses and vesicles, even those of nonviral origin, is promoted 75, 76 . IAV M2 increases proton conductance across the membrane and may act as a Na + antiporter [77] [78] [79] ; however, there is no pH gradient at the plasma membrane, which is the site of IAV budding. M2 localizes at the neck of budding virions and is necessary for this process 80 .",

            "text": "There are reports linking IAV M2 to viral entry 15, 17 . However, during entry, membrane pores are usually formed by viral glycoproteins or capsids, depending on whether the virions are enveloped or not. The formation of pores in endosomes dissipates the proton gradient and propels viral capsids into the cytosol, and we suggest that it is unlikely that the majority of known viroporins participate in this process 81 . In support of this, studies have shown that the entry and infectivity of IAV and HCV are not hindered by the presence of a defective M2 viroporin or in the absence of p7 viroporin, respectively (REFS 27, 32, 82) . Furthermore, chimeric viroporins bearing the M2 TM domain are sensitive to rimantadine, an adamantane derivative that blocks viral budding but not entry into cells 39 . Conversely, a study that examined p7 inhibitor compounds demonstrated that HCV entry is partially impeded in the presence of some of these compounds, suggesting that HCV requires p7 for entry into the cell 83 . Although the data are conflicting, we propose that viroporin-mediated permeabilization is generally not required for viral entry, as this is induced by virus particles. Thus, the cell permeabilization that is induced by virus particles appears to have a different function to the permeabilization functions of viroporins 81, 84 . Viroporins localize at the plasma membrane in specific sites surrounding the neck of the budding virus particle, as described for the influenza A virus matrix protein 2 (M2) viroporin 80 . Viroporins alter membrane permeability by conducting the flux of different ions (for example, Na + and K + ) across the membrane in favour of their concentration gradients and so reducing the transmembrane potential, which is essentially determined by three factors: the concentration of ions inside and outside the cell; the permeability of the cell membrane to those ions (that is, the ion conductance) through specific ion channels; and the activity of electrogenic pumps (for example, the (Na + +K + )ATPase and Ca 2+ transport pumps) that require energy to maintain the ion gradients across the membrane. Depolarization of the membrane (that is, decreasing the imbalance of charges across the membrane) leads to a reduction in the charge density on the membrane surface. This phenomenon would result in a decrease in the electrical or contact repulsion between opposing monolayers of the membrane at the neck of the budding site (middle) and could provide the stimulus and even the energy to locally promote budding and release 21,75 , as occurs in depolarization-dependent exocytosis 76 .",

The family Picornaviridae includes several viral species of clinical interest, including poliovirus, human rhinoviruses and hepatitis A virus. These viruses contain a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity with a single ORF that encodes a large polyprotein. All of the mature viral proteins are derived from this polyprotein by proteolytic cleavage. The mature picornavirus P2B viroporin, or its precursor, P2BC, is thought to be responsible for Golgi and mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and an increase in plasma membrane permeability to small solutes and ions, both of which effects are observed during the late phase of picornavirus infection 10, 11, 13 . As a member of the class IIB viroporins, the helical TM domains of picornavirus P2B are connected by a highly polar short stretch of amino acids, forming a hairpin \u03b1-loop-\u03b1 motif across the bilayer 40, 47, [85] [86] [87] . Research on the biogenesis of viroporins and their mechanisms of membrane insertion has been scarce to date. Recent in vitro translation experiments support the suggestion that poliovirus P2B can be inserted into the ER membrane by the SEC translocon as a helical hairpin with a cytosolic orientation for the N and C termini 88 . Furthermore, mutagenesis studies of the hairpin motif have demonstrated the functional importance of the hydrophobic-residue distribution that forms a partially amphipathic helix and is followed by an overall hydrophobic TM domain 11, 13, 86, 87, 89, 90 . Both of these domains are required for Golgi targeting and plasma membrane permeabilization 90 .",

HCV is one of the fastest mutating viruses, and about 170 million individuals throughout the world are believed to be infected 96 . Persistent infection is associated with a chronic liver disease that often progresses to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcin oma 96 . The viroporin p7 consists of 63 amino acids and is encoded at the junction between the structural and non-structural region of a viral polyprotein precursor, which is cleaved by cellular and viral proteases 97 . p7 is a member of the class IIA viroporins and possesses two TM \u03b1-helices that are slightly tilted relative to the membrane bilayer and are connected by a cytosolic loop (residues 33-39) containing a dibasic motif 38 . In human hepatocarcinoma cells transfected with the full-length genome of a JFH1 (Japanese fulminant hepatitis 1) isolate, p7 localizes primarily to the ER, and a small proportion of p7 is also detected in mitochondria and at the plasma membrane when it is ectopically overexpressed 98 . Topological analysis of epitope-tagged p7 showed that both the N and C termini are exposed to the ER lumen. However, when p7 is expressed as its precursor, E2p7, the C terminus can adopt a topology in which it faces the cytosol 98 . The oligomerization of p7 monomers in artificial membranes results in the assembly of cationselective ion channels that can be specifically blocked by different drugs, such as adamantanes, with varying efficacies 4, 24, 25, 99, 100 (TABLE 1) . Although p7 does not appear to be required for viral entry or RNA replication, it is needed for polyprotein processing 98 and is essential for a late step in viral assembly and release of infectious virions 26, 27 , as confirmed using a trans-complementation assay 38 . The essential role of p7 in the production of virus particles relies on both its viroporin activity and its interactions with other structural proteins (and possibly with NS2, a non-structural HCV protein) 27 . Indeed, IAV M2 can compensate for the ion channel activity of a fully intact but inactive p7, but cannot compensate for the activity of a p7 deletion mutant 32, 38 . This discrepancy may be due to functions of p7 that are unrelated to ion channel formation; however, this has not yet been clarified. In hepatoma cells, active p7 channels dissipate the proton gradient of the acidic vesicular compartments, causing leakage of protons into the cytosol. This inhibition of acidification is required for the production of virus particles 32 .",

The tail includes an amphipathic helix that is involved in cholesterol binding, membrane localization, budding and scission, and its extreme terminus interacts with M1 (REFS 5, 101) . The TM helix is essential for tetramerization, proton channel formation and binding to adamantane drugs such as amantadine and rimantadine 5 . It has been proposed that M2 becomes activated in acidic endosomes during viral entry and triggers viral uncoating by conducting protons to the interior of the virus particle 5, 18 . In spite of this, M2 channel activity is not essential for viral RNA replication in cell culture, but it is necessary for completion of the IAV life cycle in mice 82 . In some IAV strains, M2 channel activity also equilibrates the pH gradient between the TGN and the cytosol to prevent premature maturation of the viral glycoprotein haem agglutinin 17, 18 .

Moreover, in IAV strains lacking M2, infectivity is attenuated in both cell culture and mice 34 . During viral release, M2 is located at the neck of the budding virion. During viral egress, the C-terminal amphipathic helix alters membrane curvature in a cholesterol-dependent manner, and the protein also assists the membrane scission process independently of the host ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery 80 . However, cellular factors that interact with M2 can modulate this function, as is the case for annexin A6, which negatively regulates IAV infection by specifically interfering with the budding process 103 . It has also been reported that M2 acts as an inhibitor of autophagosome maturation 104 .",

            "text": "HIV is the causative agent of AIDS, which affects approximately 35 million people worldwide. HIV-1, as well as some other primate lentiviruses (but not HIV-2), encodes Vpu, which is translated from a bicistronic mRNA that also encodes viral glycoprotein 160 (gp160) 35 . Vpu is a class IA viroporin that is mainly located at the ER, TGN, endosomes and, to a lesser extent, the plasma membrane. Depending on the viral isolate, Vpu consists of 77-86 amino acids comprising a short ER-lumenal N-terminal domain of approximately nine residues, a single TM helix and a cytosolic domain containing two shorter \u03b1-helices (residues 33-49 and 57-70, approximately) 35, 70 . These two cytosolic helices are separated by a short flexible loop with two conserved Ser residues that are susceptible to phosphorylation by casein kinase II 35, 70 . On oligomer ization in membranes, Vpu is thought to form an oligomeric ion channel 105 . The cytosolic domain is crucial for protein trafficking through the vesicular system 3, 35, 72 . Thus, mutations in this region can cause Vpu to exhibit deficiencies in its interactions with other cellular proteins. For example, mutations located in the first \u03b1-helix revealed that this region is important for the interaction with CD4 and the subsequent degradation of this receptor 35 . More recently, an EXXXLV motif in the second \u03b1-helix has been shown to be required for efficient tetherin degradation 106 . In addition, the TM domain of Vpu interacts with cellular proteins, including CD4 and tetherin 107, 108 . The presence of CD4 at the cell surface impedes viral budding, but Vpu induces rapid degradation of newly synthesized CD4 molecules in the ER via the ubiquitin-proteasome system 70 . In addition, Vpu counteracts tetherin, a host restriction factor that is induced by interferon and strongly inhibits the release of virions from the host cell surface 23, 30, 72, 109, 110 . In this manner, this viroporin antagonizes the innate immune ",

The structures of some viroporins have been determined by X-ray crystallography, solution and solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and electron microscopy (FIG. 4) . IAV M2 is the best characterized viroporin in terms of structure, and its TM domain has been studied by X-ray crystallography with sufficient resolution to facilitate mechanistic studies of its proton-conducting function 112 . In the tetrameric pore, side chains of the highly conserved residues His37 and Trp41 in each helix face the aqueous channel and are crucial for the transport of protons (FIG. 4a) . The mechanism of M2-mediated proton conductance has been extensively studied in X. laevis oocytes, mammalian cells, lipid bilayers and vesicles 17, 18, 113 . M2 channel activation and proton selectivity are conferred by the four His37 residues, which interrupt the conductance pathway and can be protonated at low pH to enhance proton flow. Below the four His residues, the side chains of Trp41 are clustered at neutral pH and block the proton channel, thereby acting as a gate to facilitate asymmetrical conductance 5 (FIG. 4a) . A comparison of M2 structures solved at neutral (~pH 7.5) 77 , mildly acidic (~pH 6.5) 112 and acidic (~pH 5) 114 pH suggests that the gate of aromatic residues opens at low pH, concomitant with a rearrangement of the TM helices. Accordingly, His protonation correlates with tilting and bending of the TM helices relative to the pore axis 112 . In addition, the structure of M2 TM helices in complex with adamantanes has been solved 31, 77, 114 . High-resolution studies identified a high-affinity binding site for the amantadine inhibitor close to the Ser31 cluster, a pore region surrounded by residues that are mutated in amantadine-resistant viruses 114 . More recent results from solid-state NMR spectroscopy suggest that amantadine binding physically obstructs the proton channel 31 .",

            "text": "Amantadine was the first drug shown to block IAV uncoating by inhibiting the ion channel activity of M2 (REF. 118 ). It was later reported that amantadine interacts directly with HCV p7 in artificial membranes 24, 119 . However, in cell culture amantadine induces only moderate and genotype-dependent inhibition of infectious HCV production 83 . A major concern regarding the use of amantadine as a monotherapy to treat influenza is the rapid emergence of amantadineresistant IAV variants 120 , and adamantanes were also recently shown to select for specific resistance mutations in HCV p7 (REF. 121 ). The results of clinical trials suggest that toxicity and resistance explain the failure of amantadine to enhance a sustained antiviral response in patients infected with HCV 4,122 . Using an alternative approach, recent studies have demonstrated that immunizing mice with an IAV strain that lacks M2 protects against lethal doses of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus; these results suggest that this virus has potential as a live attenuated vaccine 34 . Long alkyl iminosugar derivatives, such as N-nonyl-deoxynojirimycin (NN-DNJ) and N-nonyl-deoxygalactonojirimycin (NN-DGJ), inhibit the function of the HCV p7 ion channel in vitro and reduce the production of infectious viruses 25, 28, 121 . However, UT-231B, a derivative of NN-DNJ with \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition properties, was used in a clinical Phase II study but did not demonstrate satisfactory efficacy 123 . Amiloride derivatives, especially 5-(N,Nhexamethylene) amiloride (HMA), can also inhibit HCV p7, HIV-1 Vpu and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) E channel activity 33, 99, 124 . HMA also impairs HIV budding and SARS-CoV replication. However, the concentration that is required to block the function of the p7 channel is cytotoxic in cell culture 83 . A new p7 ion channel inhibitor, BIT225 (N-(5-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-napthalene-2-carbonyl)-guanidine), is a potential candidate for future treatments against HCV. In a Phase Ib/IIa trial, administration of BIT225 for a week induced a | High-resolution (1.65 \u00c5) X-ray structure of the oligomers formed by a peptide representing the transmembrane region (residues 25-46) of the class IA viroporin matrix protein 2 (M2) from influenza A virus. Crystals were obtained at pH 6.5 in the presence of N-octylglucoside (Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession 3LBW). In the ribbon representation (right), constituent helices (H1-H4) are indicated, and side chains of His37 and Trp41 are depicted in blue and green, respectively. Structures were generated using Swiss-PdbViewer. b | Solid-state NMR structure of the transmembrane region (residues 2-30) from the class IA viroporin viral protein U (Vpu) from HIV-1, in lipid bilayers (PDB accession 1PI7). The oligomeric form was calculated using energy minimization protocols, and side chains were added to a backbone structure that was generated from solid-state NMR spectroscopy data. Ribbon representations (right) display the constituent helices (H1-H5) and side chains of Ile17 and Trp22 in yellow and green, respectively. Structures were generated using Swiss-PdbViewer. c | Density map contours of oligomers of p7, a class IIA viroporin from hepatitis C virus, solubilized in detergent. Simulated p7 monomers were fitted with their amino and carboxyl termini oriented towards the petal tips 29 (right). a moderate reduction of the viral load in patients infected with bovine viral diarrhoea virus, an HCVrelated virus 125 . It has also been reported that this compound can target HIV-1 Vpu and inhibit viral release from macrophages 126 . Recently, a classic anion exchanger inhibitor, DIDS (4,4\u0374-diisothiocyano-2,2\u0374-stilbenedisulphonic acid), was reported to partially suppress the chloride conductance that is mediated by the enterovirus P2B viroporin in X. laevis oocytes and to block virus production in human cells 127 .",

With the advent of new bioinformatic tools and the availability of infectious clones, the identification of new members of the viroporin family is progressing at an increasing rate. Currently, viroporins are also emerging as new potential targets for clinical intervention. In this regard, the establishment of liposome-based assays and the development of high-throughput screening systems will facilitate the discovery of new and more potent inhibitors of viral infection 119, 128 . We foresee that these systems could be optimized for drug screening, potentially leading to the identification and isolation of new antiviral compounds. Selective inhibitors of viroporins are useful tools to unveil the multi functional activities of each viroporin during viral infection. Further more, advances in molecular biology techniques have facili tated the cloning and highyield expression of viroporins, thereby allowing the implementation of crystal lization protocols 114 and NMR techniques to elucidate the structure of these proteins and to aid in their molecular characterization 22 . We predict that the availability of high-resolution crystallographic pore structures will boost the rational design of specific viroporin inhibitors in the near future.",
