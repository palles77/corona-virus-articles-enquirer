Indeed, the US Centers for Disease Control and Pre vention recommend chemoprophyl axis with either oseltamivir or zanamivir against H1N1 infl uenza for people at risk of complications, including pregnant women. 2 However, a survey 3 has shown that oseltamivir has important side-eff ects (including gastrointestinal and neuropsychiatric symptoms) in more than half of treated children, raising serious questions about the wide use of this compound, not only in children, but also in pregnancy.",

Two human anti-infl uenza A H5N1 monoclonal anti bodies (hMAbs) 5 have been cloned, and their H5N1-neu tral ising potential has been assessed against highly pathogenic avian strains, indicating that powerful and safe treatment of infl uenza H5N1 infections with hMAbs is possible. From this point of view, a strategy for the treatment and prevention of H1N1 infection in pregnancy based on neutralising human monoclonal antibodies should be planned in the future, being also aware of the effi cient protection of the fetus by circulating IgGs.",

Denise Jamieson and colleagues 1 highlight high morbidity and mortality rates in pregnant women infected with the H1N1 infl uenza virus. Admission rates were 41% and the median time from symptom onset to receipt of antiviral therapy was 9 days. Could earlier initiation of antiviral treatment have resulted in a better outcome? In 2003, Singapore was notably aff ected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 2 which led to the formation of a rapid response team, hospital quarantine, infect ious disease control measures, temperature screening at borders and in public buildings and spaces, timely public education, and constant communication with the public. 3, 4 In response to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's advice on poorer outcomes in H1N1-aff ected pregnant women on May 12, 2009, the above SARS strategies, coupled with rapid access to quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR within 24 h of presentation and early institution of antiviral therapy, was started from June 30, 2009, in Singapore.",
