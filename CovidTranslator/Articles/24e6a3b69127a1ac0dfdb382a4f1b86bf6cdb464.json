            "text": "syncytial virus (RSVs), enteroviruses, and adenoviruses have been regarded as important pathogens causing nosocomial outbreaks. In recent years, the role of rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in outbreaks has also been increasingly recognized. [6] [7] [8] [9] The importance of the latter group of viruses has become clear only with widespread availability of molecular diagnostic tests. More recently, human bocavirus has been added to the list of potential etiologies. [10, 11] Surveillance of respiratory disease outbreaks in long-term care facilities has shown that outbreaks of influenza are clinically indistinguishable from other viral outbreaks. [12] The management of outbreaks is beyond the scope of this review but may include isolation of affected cases and cohorting of contacts, in addition to prophylaxis and or treatment with antiviral agents. The duration of isolation or cohorting and the initiation and cessation of anti-viral administration, as well as the selection of the specific agent, will be mandated by the identity of a specific viral etiology, particularly if influenza is detected. [13] Conventional methods of viral diagnosis are limited both by the ability to isolate only a limited range of the viruses causing respiratory diseases and by the restricted range of viruses that can be diagnosed rapidly by antigen detection. The availability of sensitive and specific molecular assays has facilitated more rapid diagnosis of a much wider range of viruses from respiratory outbreaks and has enhanced our understanding of the viral etiology of such outbreaks. Both multiplex and singletarget molecular assays enhance sensitivity, compared with traditional methods. [14, 15] Furthermore, it has been shown that the use of sensitive and broad-spectrum molecular assays can enhance diagnosis through detection of a respiratory virus in cases where the presence of the agent was not suspected or a test for the etiologic agent was not specifically ordered by the clinician. [16, 17] Nevertheless, further validation of emerging technologies for multi-targeted molecular diagnosis of viral infections will be needed to ensure broad virus amplification and detection. [18, 19] This review presents a critical analysis of molecular methods available for use in the investigation of viral outbreaks. For the purposes of this review, diagnostic assays for detection of viral pathogens are divided into three broad categories: traditional methods; commercial molecular assays; and in-house-developed or home-brew molecular tests. This review is not intended to be a meta-analysis of available in-house and commercial assays for molecular diagnostics of respiratory viruses; rather, it is intended to present a succinct, high-level categorization of the different molecular approaches, based on the multiplex demultiplex approach that is used, with examples that will serve to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of each category for outbreak investigation in the context of common tests in use today, from the point of view of a reference or public health laboratory.",

[21, 22] The sensitivity of antigen tests for influenza viruses may be as low as 25%, compared with culture, [23] and it is significantly lower than the sensitivity of direct fluorescent-antibody assays. The analytical sensitivity of rapid antigen methods for detection of influenza A is approximately four 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID 50 ). [24] Electron microscopic detection of viruses has been replaced in many laboratories by other methods. This approach has disadvantages in terms of the high cost of the equipment, the significant expertise required to prepare specimens and interpret results, and lower sensitivity than molecular methods. [25] However, examination of negative-stained specimen preparations offers the most rapid means of scanning for a wide range of viruses, [26] which may not be detectable by specific molecular assays or staining procedures. In addition, electron microscopy may be useful for identification of viruses grown in cell cultures, [27] particularly if these are previously unrecognized viruses. [28] ",

Cultures of respiratory specimens are usually incubated in a rotating drum, which encourages faster growth of respiratory viruses and earlier detection of cytopathic effects. [29] Cultures performed in shell vials after centrifugation are much more rapid than conventional tube monolayers, [30] usually giving results within 24-48 hours. Similarly, co-cultured mixtures of cell types have been used for more rapid detection of respiratory viruses. [31] These approaches have the disadvantage that fixation and staining limit the range of viruses that can be detected in a single culture. As reagents become available for newly recognized viral pathogens, [32, 33] the number of shell vials that are inoculated can be increased, with additional costs.",

            "text": "Conventional virologic methods that have been used for detection and identification of viral respiratory pathogens remain useful. In some circumstances, conventional methods can be preferable to molecular methods, for a range of biologic and technical reasons. [19] For example, the culture of viruses permits full identification and characterization of any virus that can be isolated, including phenotypic confirmation of antiviral susceptibilities. Moreover, culture can often detect novel strains or emerging viruses. Conversely, molecular methods are often more sensitive but are limited to the intended target virus, requiring knowledge of the genome sequence to provide a complete template from which molecular assays can be developed rapidly. Thus, failure to detect any of the targets in a molecular assay does not rule out the absence of a virus that is not included in the assay. This is countered in practice by the ability to rapidly design and detect new viruses, using degenerate primers. [28] The greater sensitivity offered by molecular methods also comes with a cost of higher quality control standards and as-surance programs to prevent and detect false positives due to contamination. Laboratories that use nucleic acid amplification technologies must take precautions to prevent false positive results that might arise from contamination of specimens by amplification products of previously analyzed specimens. To avoid contamination, the workflow must be strictly unidirectional with no movement of specimens or materials in the reverse direction. Ideally, procedures should be carried out in four physically separated rooms for dedicated tasks of reagent preparation, specimen preparation, reaction set-up, and postamplification analysis. [39] Most importantly, the post-amplification room should have 100% exhaust air with negative pressure relative to that in all other laboratories. The reagent preparation room should have 100% supply air with positive pressure relative to that in all other laboratories. Each laboratory should have dedicated equipment, supplies, and lab coats. Use of sticky mats, dedicated personnel, and strict handwashing policies are helpful. Unwanted spread of amplicons outside the post-amplification room can be monitored with environmental swabs. In comparison, conventional virology is less prone to contamination issues than molecular methods.",

            "text": "The multi-targeted approach is often accomplished with multiplexed amplification of the targeted nucleic acid. Several nucleic acid amplification technologies have been established and have been reviewed elsewhere. [18, 48, 49] For example, am-plification can be performed using a multiplexed version of PCR, and then products or amplicons of this reaction need to be demultiplexed for proper detection and identification of the virus. [50] This demultiplexing can be done by a variety of technologies including, but not limited to, probe-based fluorescent differentiation, [51] capillary and gel electrophoresis, [52] microarray technology, [53] Luminex beads with flow cytometric analysis, [54] or mass spectrophotometry. [55, 56] The following sections highlight each of these approaches, with specific examples that are currently available and useful for investigation of respiratory viral outbreaks. Extensive reviews covering a broader scope of molecular assays that are useful for outbreak-related viral detection and characterization have been published. [57, 58] Use of molecular assays has generated significant information about the epidemiology of respiratory viral outbreaks that was not readily obtained using conventional methods. Co-infections involving two or more viruses were previously not detected often, [59] but are now detected frequently through the use of molecular methods (table I) . [60] [61] [62] Many of these involve viruses that were formerly undetectable or were simply not sought using conventional methods. [63] In addition, many outbreaks can be shown to involve multiple viruses circulating within an institution. [64] In our initial study of 22 institutional outbreaks using a multiplex approach, multiple viruses were detected in eight outbreaks (36%). [65] 3. Probe-Based PCR Assays PCR assays developed for outbreak investigations typically fall into two categories: multi-targeted PCR using consensus or universal primers; and several single-plex PCRs, which are then used in a triaged manner. For example, detection of novel strains of influenza A has been done with universal primers [66] and with more type-specific single-plex PCRs in a reflexed manner. [67] Typically, a combination of universal primers and specific primers is most useful for outbreak investigation. A good example is an influenza A screening approach whereby laboratories start with a broad-spectrum single-plex PCR, based on the highly conserved matrix gene, and follow-up the typing of positively identified influenza A specimens using typespecific PCRs against the hemagglutinin gene. [68, 69] In either case, the combination of primers or the array of single-plex PCRs are designed to provide a process of elimination to hone in on the viral pathogen of interest, thereby identifying the causative outbreak agent.",

It provides real-time results with the appropriate instrumentation, contamination containment with closed-tube amplification that requires no post-PCR manipulation, and reduced implementation costs due to its robust nature. Several real-time PCR probe technologies exist, such as 5 0 nuclease (TaqMan \u00d2 ) probes (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA), molecular beacons, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) hybridization probes. [70] However, multiplexing is further challenged with the need to avoid fluorescent cross-talk. Analysis of the fluorescent signal is aided by spectral calibration, which associates the target probe with its proper wavelength, but this is theoretically limited to five targets. In diagnostic practice, however, real-time multiplexing is difficult to optimize and is often seen with fewer than five targets. [71] More commonly, real-time PCRs are used as single-target assays to avoid competitive inhibition, whereby one or more of the targets are preferentially amplified over one of the other multiplexed targets. There are several examples of commercially available assays in this category, but perhaps the best studied and validated example is the ProFlu+ Assay (Gen-Probe Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). This assay is a multiplexed real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR that detects influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and RSV. Although assays that are developed in-house can offer the best combination in terms of per-specimen cost and flexibility, it is important to note that these assays must also pass rigorous validation studies before implementation. False negatives due to low sensitivity and false positives due to low specificity must be eliminated before implementation in any outbreak investigation. Consequently, the start-up cost for in-house methods is greater than that for commercially available molecular methods and may mean higher initial capital costs for the necessary equipment, whereas commercially available assays can often be established without any equipment purchase.",

[53] In outbreak investigations, with low numbers of samples and the need for same-day results, the microarray approach may not be the best choice. However, considering the substantial reduction in hands-on time, microarray-based assays are a very viable option for higher volumes of samples. cytometric analysis. These systems operate on the Luminex xMAP \u00d2 instrument, which is a detection platform that uses lasers to read color-coded microspheres that attach to specific nucleic acid sequences. Viral nucleic acids are extracted from the sample, and a multiplex RT-PCR reaction is carried out under optimized conditions, resulting in amplicons for each of the viruses subtypes present in the sample. Each RT-PCR product is treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase and with exonuclease I before incorporation of biotin-deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) during a TSPE reaction. TSPE effectively helps to detect viral DNA that is present in the sample, using a unique sequence tag. After TSPE, the reaction is added directly to microwells containing bead-immobilized anti-tags, which are the complements of the sequence tags on the primers. The beads are spectrally distinguishable from each other using flow cytometry, so that each uniquely colored bead represents a specific virus through the bead anti-tag tagged primer association. The xTAG \u00d2 RVP is perhaps the best-validated commercially available assay using Luminex \u00d2 beads with flow cytometric analysis.

The following virus types and subtypes are identified using the classic version of the CEmarked xTAG \u00d2 RVP assay: influenza A (subtypes H1 [seasonal], H3 [seasonal], and H5), influenza B, RSV (subgroups A and B), parainfluenza virus (types 1, 2, 3, and 4), coronavirus (strains NL63, OC43, HKU1, and 229E), acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), hMPV, entero-rhinovirus, and adenovirus.",

However, the most promising advantage of using mass spectrophotometry for the demultiplexing stage of PCR is the speed and cost effectiveness of this method and its ability to deal with a mixture of amplicons, which challenges traditional DNA sequencing. The weakness to date has been the lack of a public-domain database of base compositions, with attention given to potential mutation-associated differences that will dramatically affect the accuracy of identification. Allelic difference and mutations are less devastating to identification by 290 Antonishyn & Levett DNA sequencing. Base composition databases, which are required for analysis, have not yet been developed fully, unlike DNA sequencing data, which are currently available in several well established databases such as GenBank, with over 300 000 organisms at the genus level or lower. [76] It may be possible to use RNA-dependent RNA polymerase as a target for viral identification, using mass spectrophotometry which, in theory, could provide sufficient coverage for outbreak investigations.
