This mutant has a genetic defect in copper metabolism and spontaneous neuronal degeneration develops around postnatal day 10, in particular in the parasagittal regions of the cerebral cortex and thalamus. The antibodies to macrophage specific antigen, F4180 and to type-three complement receptor, Mac-I were used for the study. Reactive morphological changes of microglia, which are immuno-reactive to the antibodies to F4/80 and/or Mac-l, were demonstrated in areas corresponding to those of neuronal degeneration, coincident with the emergence of cells expressing major histocompatibility complex class II, Ia, antigen. Some of the Ia expressing cells had morphological features of ramified microglia, while others were rod shaped with few processes and were mostly located in the perivascular regions. The focal nature of such cellular changes suggests that signal(s) from the degenerating neurons may be responsible for microglial activation and cellular expression of the la antigen in the brain of the brindled mouse.",

For many years, there had been controversies as to the origin of microglia but by now it is generally accepted that microglia are cells of the monocyte lineage. More recently, microglia and brain macrophages have drawn the special attention of many investigators because of their presumed active roles in the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis s'14.t~'2\u00b0'27'2s'3\u00b0. Reactions of microglia to neuronal damage have been investigated experimentally in 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesions in the substantia nigra t and in the facial nerve nuclei induced either by axotomy ts or by an intra-axonal injection of toxic ricin 43. However, the reactions of microglia to these experimentally induced lesions are temporal events and do not reflect the spontaneous and gradual neuronal degeneration seen in neurodegenerative diseases.",

In this murine mutant, neuronal degeneration gradually develops around the postnatal day (P)10, and death usually occurs before reaching P15 with extensive neuronal degeneration. Chronological events of neuronal degeneration in this mutant have been studied in detail s\u00b0. Therefore, we investigated temporo-spatial microglial reactions to neuronal degeneration, caused by a metabolic perturbation using this mutant. We also investigated the effects of neonatal malnutrition (or starvation) on microglial reactions, since these mutant mice became markedly emaciated at the terminal stage. The results indicate that morphological alterations of microglia occurred regionally, coincident with neuronal degeneration. Also, as has been noted in several neurodegenerative diseases in humans 27 as well as in an experimentally induced neuronal injury 42, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen, Ia, expressing cells appeared in or in close vicinity to the site of neuronal degeneration. Some of these Ia expressing cells had distinct morphological features of ramified microglia but others were rod shaped with few processes resembling perivascular microglia 24.",

In brief, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C and then sequentially incubated with biotinylated rabbit anti-rat IgG (1:100 in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature, and in 1% ABC-Elite reagent for 1 h. Primary antibodies were diluted with PBS (1:300 for !:4/80; 1:500 for MAb-Mac-l: 1:300 for MAb-la). An antibody for GFAP was diluted at 1:20,000 with PBS containing 0,3% triton-X-100.

Mac-1 positive cells were also identified but were very faintly stained in the brains of these young mice. On P3, many F4/80 positive cells had round cell bodies with a few processes (primitive microglia 32) or without processes (ameboid microglia) and were concentrated in the corpus callosum, paraventricular white matter and internal capsule. A few F4/80 positive ramified microglia were also recognized mostly in the cerebral cortex ( Brindled hemizygous mice. On P3 and 5, most of the F4/80 positive cells in the cerebrum were primitive microglia ( Fig. 1B) but gradually ramified microglia increased in number. On P7, the morphology of both F4/80 positive and Mac-1 positive microglia in the cerebral cortex in hemizygous mice were similar to that of controls. However, after P10, Mac-1 positive cells with various morphological features (reactive microglia/macrophages) appeared in the cerebrum, in addition to the ramified microglia (Fig. 2) . Some of these reactive microglia/macrophages were rod-shaped or round-shaped with only a few processes, while others had numerous convoluted thick processes suggestive of the transitional form from the ramified microglia. These reactive micro- gliaJmacrophages were most numerous in the cingulate cortex (Fig. 3A) , cortex around the sulcus rhinalis, piriform cortex (Fig. 3B) , hippocampus (Fig. 3C) , lateral thalamus and the internal capsule (Fig. 3D ). In the frontal and parietal cortices where a laminar pattern of neuronal degeneration was observed (Fig. 4A) , these reactive microgliaJmacrophages were distributed in a well defined laminar pattern (Fig. 4B) . Reactive microglia/ macrophages were more numerous with intense immunoreactivity on P14 when neuronal degeneration was more advanced. At ultrastructural level, Mac-1 positive ramified microglia had slender processes and scant perikaryal cytoplasm and were often observed as perineuronal cells (Fig. 5A) . Some degenerating neurons were surrounded by the processes of Mac-I immune-reactive cells (Fig.  5B) , which sometimes contained electron-dense granular tissue debris.",

In agreement with an earlier report by Perry et al. 34 , we noted that immunoreactivity of immature microglia to MAb-Mac-1 was very weak before P10, With age, immature microglia de- creased and Mac-1 positive ramified microglia increased. After P10, the majority of microglia in the brains of control mice were Mac-1 positive ramified microglia. In the brindled hemizygous mice, there appeared to be more immature microglia on P5 suggesting some delay in maturation but such a difference was no longer ap-preciated on P7 when the majority of microglia were ramified in both hemizygous and control brains. After P10, with progression of neuronal degeneration, various shaped Mac-1 positive cells (reactive microglia/macrophages) emerged in the brains of brindled hemizygous mice. Morphological features of reactive microglia/macrophages described here were similar to those of cells described as activated, phagocytic or reactive microglia in other pathological conditions 4'6'7'35'4\u00b0.",

Mac-1 positive reactive microglia/macrophages appeared on Pl0 predominantly in the regions where neuronal degeneration was noted, suggesting that degenerating neurons release some signals or factors causing such morphological transformation of microglia. Our observation is in agreement with that of Streit and Kreutzberg who noted reactive changes of microglia in ricin injected facial nuclei only after irreversible neuronal damage had occurred 43.",

It also appears tO play an important role in adhesion dependent functions such as granulocyte chemotaxis, adherence to surface and aggregation 3g. Thus, the pronounced immuno-reactivity of these reactive microglia/macrophages with MAb-Mac-1 may indicate elevated cellular functions that include phagocytic, secretory or adhesive capacities s'ts '39,49. Although mechanisms and/or regulation of microglial transformations in vivo are not well understood, several factors such as gamma interferon, the interleukins and granulocytes/macrophage colony stimulating factor ((3/ M-CSF) are known to induce microglial transformations in vitro ~\u00b0'~2'46. More recently Giulian et al. found two microglial growth factors in the cerebral cortex of rat between embryonic day E-16 and postnatal day PN-1 and in the injured brain tissue ~s. These authors found that one of them, MM~, stimulated proliferation of mononuclear phagocytes from bone marrow but not the other, MM2. Interestingly, when the activities of these growth factors were monitored using astrocytes in vitro, they found that astrocytes did not secrete MMI. Thus, their result suggests that the cells, other than astrocytes, may be responsible for the stimulation of mononuclear phagocytes.",

Alternatively, it is possible that some immunological mechanisms are involved in cellular degeneration in these pathological conditions in humans as well as in experimental animals. In the twitcher mouse with major pathological changes in the white matter, Ia expressing cells were more numerous in the white matter ~9, while in the brindled mouse with pronounced neuronal degeneration, Ia expressing cells were found strictly in the gray matter. These observations suggest that Ia expression is reg-ulated by local pathological processes. Ia antigen expression could be induced by gamma interferon in vivo 31 and in vitro 36 '45 , and systemic treatment with interferon gamma alone or in combination with tumor necrosis factor alpha causes microglial cell processes to express class I and class II MHC antigens ~7. Gamma-interferon-like immunoreactivity has been shown to be present in certain neurons of the central and peripheral nervous system in normal animals 9'22'25. More recently, transient expression of gamma-interferon-like immunoreactivity has been demonstrated in the axotomized rat motor neurons 33. Therefore, it is possible that gamma-interferonlike immunoreactivity may be expressed in the degenerating neurons in the brindled mouse, although the expression of such immuno-reactivity by neurons may not be necessarily related to the la induction in nonneuronal cells 21.",
