            "text": "One treatment strategy with therapeutic potential is to target host proteins required by RSV for infection. To do this, however, suitable target proteins must first be identified. In recent years, genome-wide knockout (KO) screens in human haploid cells-and most recently, CRISPR KO screens in a variety of cells-have been used to identify host factors required by several viruses from different families, e.g., Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, and Parvoviridae (Carette et al., 2009, 2011; Jae et al., 2013 Jae et al., , 2014 Marceau et al., 2016; Pillay et al., 2016; Riblett et al., 2016; Savidis et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016) . In all cases, genes that are essential for N-linked glycosylation were highly enriched in the screens. This is likely because cell-surface sugars play an important role in virus attachment prior to receptor engagement. While these genome-wide KO screens were highly successful in identifying entry factors and virus receptors (Pillay and Carette, 2015) , few host factors have been described and characterized that interfere with later steps in the viral life cycle such as virus maturation and egress. Moreover, unlike receptors, which are often virus specific, host genes required for late stages of the viral life cycle might affect many viruses of the same family or even viruses from different families. With their potential for broad antiviral impact, identifying these host factors may be of value.",

Like similar screens with other viruses, proteins involved in N-linked glycosylation were highly enriched. However, we also identified the calcium pump, SPCA1, which resides in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Unlike many of the other hits in the screen that are likely to affect virus entry, our mechanistic studies suggest that SPCA1 is critical for late stages of the virus life cycle. Indeed, we show that SPCA1 influences protease activity in the Golgi and is required for proper viral glycoprotein processing and virus maturation. Furthermore, we show that in addition to RSV, a variety of RNA viruses require SPCA1 for infection. We also provide evidence that even partial reduction in SPCA1 protein levels negatively affects virus spread. Taken together, these features make SPCA1 a promising target for therapeutic intervention against a diverse set of emerging viruses.",

Genes involved in heparan sulfate biosynthesis were top hits, as were genes important for vesicle trafficking and protein maturation within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus ( Figure 1B ). Similar genes were recently identified in host factor screens for dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Rift Valley fever virus (Marceau et al., 2016; Riblett et al., 2016; Savidis et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016) . We also identified SPCA1, a secretory pathway calcium (Ca 2+ ) transport ATPase encoded by ATP2C1 ( Figure 1B ) that facilitates Ca 2+ and Mn 2+ uptake into the TGN (Behne et al., 2003; Lissandron et al., 2010; Micaroni et al., 2010) . The TGN is rich in enzymes (e.g., glycosyl-and sulfotransferases, and proprotein convertases) that require Ca 2+ and/or Mn 2+ as cofactors (Kaufman et al., 1994; Oda, 1992; Vanoevelen et al., 2007) , and since SPCA1 has not previously been reported to influence virus infection, we chose to further investigate its role.",

Consistent with our screen, SPCA1 was non-essential for cell survival, and loss of SPCA1 did not affect cell growth ( Figure S1C ) . We then infected wild-type (WT) and SPCA1 KO cells with RSV at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) to monitor initial infection at 24 hr post infection (hpi) or a low MOI to monitor virus spread at 72 hpi. There was a moderate reduction in frequency of RSV-infected cells at 24 hpi when comparing KO cells with WT cells, and in the context of strong positive selection it may be that this moderate effect on virus entry allowed SPCA1 KO cells to survive; however, the most prominent phenotype was observed at 72 hpi, when SPCA1 KO cells showed a striking decrease in virus spread. This phenotype, observed under low-MOI conditions, is likely a reflection of the need for passage through the steps of virus assembly and egress. The reduced (B) Fishtail plots of the unselected control set and the RSV-selected set. Significant hits that were identified in the RSV screen are labeled by name and shown in both unselected and RSV-selected sets to highlight enrichment. Distinct gene trap insertions were mapped and counted taking into account their orientation relative to the affected genes. Per gene, the percentage of sense orientation gene trap insertions (y axis) and the total number of insertions in a particular gene (x axis) are plotted. Hits are colored to indicate their involvement in different pathways: blue, heparan sulfate biosynthesis; green, vesicular trafficking; red, Golgi calcium transporters; yellow, miscellaneous. See also Table S1. susceptibility to RSV infection and the defect in viral spread was rescued by trans-complementation of SPCA1 (Figures 2A and  2B ). These results suggest that SPCA1 may play a role during entry but is primarily involved in the later stages of the virus life cycle. We made similar observations for human parainfluenza virus 3 (hPIV-3) and measles virus (MeV): hPIV-3 failed to spread in SPCA1 KO cells ( Figures 2C and 2D) , and MeV glycoproteinmediated cell-cell fusion was significantly reduced ( Figure 2E ).",

To further confirm this, we treated SPCA1 KO cells with calcimycin, an ionophore that promotes Ca 2+ flux across membranes, and found that it also rescued SPCA1 deficiency. This is illustrated by an increase in MeV glycoproteinmediated syncytia formation upon addition of calcimycin (Figure S2A) .

Reduced Ca 2+ in the TGN of SPCA1 KO cells may therefore affect protease activity. Indeed, we found that furin protein levels are decreased in SPCA1 KO cells and are restored upon SPCA1 trans-complementation, suggesting that furin is destabilized under reduced Ca 2+ conditions ( Figures 4F and 4G ). Furthermore, treating WT cells with a proprotein convertase inhibitor that inhibits furin, Dec-RVKR-CMK, phenocopied the hPIV-3 and MeV spread defect in SPCA1 KO cells (Figures S2B and S2C) . Interestingly, while the spread of both RSV and hPIV-3 is impaired in SPCA1 KO cells, in LoVo cells, which are devoid of furin activity, only the spread of RSV is impaired (Figures S3A-S3D) (Takahashi et al., 1995) . This suggests that in addition to furin, hPIV-3 can utilize other proprotein convertases, which are also impaired in SPCA1 KO cells. Like furin, all known proprotein convertases undergo a series of orchestrated autoproteolytic cleavage steps (Anderson et al., 2002) . For different convertases, these maturation events can occur in distinct compartments modulated by pH and Ca 2+ concentration (Vanoevelen et al., 2007) . Imbalances in these ion concentrations can affect proprotein stability and activation. SPCA1 resides in the TGN and is the sole provider of Ca 2+ for this compartment. Therefore, loss of SPCA1 may affect multiple proprotein convertases in the TGN. Indeed, furin is localized to the TGN and furin-dependent viruses fail to spread in SPCA1 KO cells. In contrast, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which utilizes the early Golgi protease SKI-1/S1P (Beyer et al., 2003) , is unaffected ( Figure S4B ). This is consistent with our results showing that LCMV spread is unimpaired in furin-deficient LoVo cells ( Figure S3F ).",

To test this, we infected WT and SPCA1 KO cells with hPIV-3 and RSV, collected the supernatants, and quantified viral RNA by qRT-PCR and infectivity of progeny virus by plaque assay. Supernatants from both cell types had a similar number of viral RNA copies, but supernatants from SPCA1 KO cells were significantly less infectious than those from WT cells ( Figures 4A-4D ). Next, we evaluated the glycoprotein conformation of particles released from hPIV-3-infected WT and KO cells. HPIV-3 infectivity requires cleavage of the precursor F 0 viral glycoprotein to mediate virus-cell membrane fusion and syncytia. For most paramyxoviruses this cleavage is performed by the cellular TGN protease, furin (Chang and Dutch, 2012) . Notably, we found that the F proteins in viral particles released from SPCA1 KO cells were mostly uncleaved ( Figure 4H ). The defect in viral spread was fully rescued when we added trypsin to cell supernatants during viral infection ( Figure 4E) . These results support a model in which SPCA1 is absent or unable to transport Ca 2+ into the TGN, furin is less active, and glycoprotein processing and viral infectivity are reduced.",

            "text": "Viruses readily adapt to environmental changes, and arising escape mutations help to understand which viral proteins are targeted. We passaged RSV and hPIV-3 on SPCA1 KO cells to select a virus capable of spread. We were unable to select a resistant RSV variant; however, after five passages, two mutations appeared in the hPIV-3 F protein: D104G and G398D. The G398D mutation is located within the F protein's antigenic site A and has been shown to confer resistance to neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (Coelingh and Tierney, 1989) . It was identified in clinical isolates in conjunction with changes in the proteolytic cleavage site (Coelingh and Winter, 1990) . Interestingly, the D104G mutation is located within the furin-binding pocket at the P6 position directly adjacent to the consensus furin cleavage site ( Figure 5A ). For other respiratory viruses, it has been shown that mutations in the F protein cleavage site can alter recognition by cellular proteases (Bando et al., 1991; Collins et al., 1993; Glickman et al., 1988; Tashiro et al., 1988) . We therefore hypothesize that the D104G mutation facilitates hPIV-3 spread in SPCA1 deficient cells either by increasing the F protein's susceptibility for furin cleavage or by creating a better substrate for a different protease (Remacle et al., 2008) . Additional work is required to determine whether D104G alone is sufficient for viral spread in SPCA1-deficient cells or whether G398D also plays a role. The selected virus was able to efficiently spread in SPCA1 Hap1 KO cells, although it appeared to be more cytotoxic than the WT virus. Interestingly, when BHK-21 cells were infected with both viruses, we observed altered fusion properties with the selected variant being hyperfusogenic ( Figure 5A ). Furthermore, while the hPIV-3 variant spread efficiently in SPCA1 KO cells, it was less fit than WT virus in primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cell cultures. Together, this indicates there is a high fitness cost for this adaptation (Figures 5B and 5C ).",

As expected, SPCA1 protein levels were lower in fibroblasts from HHD patients compared with those from WT controls, and although furin protein levels were similar ( Figure S6A ), hPIV-3 produced in patient-derived fibroblasts was less infectious than virus produced in WT cells. Furthermore, we were able to fully restore hPIV-3 infectivity by adding trypsin ( Figure 6E ). To test whether transient suppression of SPCA1 in WT cells could also impair virus spread, we treated Hap1 cells and HAE cell cultures with Morpholino oligomers. Morpholinos are synthetic molecules that can modify gene expression by blocking translation or splicing, and their efficacy in decreasing protein abundance has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo (Bottcher-Friebertshauser et al., 2011; Krahling et al., 2009; Moerdyk-Schauwecker et al., 2009; Moulton and Moulton, 2010) . The Morpholino we designed binds specifically to an intron-exon junction of ATP2C1, interferes with its splicing, and therefore reduces its abundance ( Figure S6B ). We observed that hPIV-3 spread and titers were significantly decreased in both culture systems ( Figures 6A-6C) . This was true regardless of whether cultures were treated prior to or after infection, and this may be important with respect to antiviral therapies ( Figures 6A-6C ).",

Besides affecting viral entry, SPCA1 deficiency had a major impact on viral spread. Upon further study we found that like RSV, other viruses from the Paramyxoviridae, Flaviviridae, and Togaviridae families also failed to spread in SPCA1-deficient cells. We then showed that when SPCA1 was absent or unable to transport Ca 2+ into the TGN, furin protease levels were reduced, viral glycoprotein processing was impaired, and newly generated virus particles were less infectious.",

In this regard, SPCA1 has several attractive qualities: it affects viruses from multiple families; it has an enzymatic active site that can be targeted by small-molecule compounds; reduced SPCA1 is tolerated in humans; and even partial loss of SPCA1 activity is sufficient to decrease viral burden. Furthermore, the mechanism of action of SPCA1 and its impact on TGN proteases suggests that filoviruses such as Ebola virus and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses might also be sensitive to SPCA1 deficiency. For acute viral infections like these, decreasing viral spread could significantly improve disease outcomes.",

Besides proteases, other Golgi-residing enzymes such as glycosyl-and sulfotransferases may be negatively affected by the loss of SPCA1. The absence of SPCA1 may therefore decrease glycosylation or maturation of cell-surface proteins, thereby affecting the ability of viral particles to attach to and engage specific receptors. More work is needed to elucidate the role of SPCA1 in shaping the plasma membrane proteome, but targeting SPCA1 may interfere with two critical steps of the viral life cycle: viral glycoprotein maturation required for release of infectious particles, and the optimal constellation of cell-surface determinants for efficient virus binding and entry.",

It has been broadly used as the appropriate negative control for custom vivo-Morpholino oligos. Morpholinos were added to apical site of HAE cultures at different concentrations in a volume of 20 ml (48 h prior to infections or 24 h post infections). The treatment was replenished every 24 h for the duration of the experiment.
