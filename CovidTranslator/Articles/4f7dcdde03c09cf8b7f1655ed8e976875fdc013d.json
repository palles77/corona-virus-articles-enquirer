Owing to the limited time to response, decisions must be made immediately, making comprehensive emergency management. The government of Zhuahi canceled all the religious activities. As a destination of tourists, all the scenic pots were shut down to face this emergency, including beaches and community parks. Public transport had been reduced to half at January 26 th , 2020 and reduced to less than 5% at February 7 th , 2020. Close contacts were defined as passengers in the same carriage of a train, ship or airplane with the diagnosed patients. Once these close contacts were found, they would be isolated for medical surveillance or treatment. At January 26 th , 2020, when a definite diagnosis had been made on 10 patients in Zhuhai, Zhuhai citizens were required to wear facial masks at all public occasions, and transgressors would be punished by the police owing to violate Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases. All the students attended class online at home after the semester was postponed. And all residential areas adopted close management. CDC required that residents back to Zhuhai isolated themselves at home for 14 days. The government of Zhuhai established a series of measures and policies to support the many mid-minor enterprises during such a long-term termination of business, including labour subsidies, scientific research input, loan discounts, tax relief, etc. Zhuhai CDC established ten emergency response teams for epidemiological investigation, case report, specimen collection, epidemic sites disinfection, close contacts management, emergency monitoring, health education, risk assessment, technical guidance, etc. Medical staff were sent to bus stations, quays, rail stations and airports for screening suspicious cases. Fever clinics in Zhuhai are opened around the clock.",
