For the first time, we demonstrate a systematic, high throughput approach to identification of UBA domain-interacting proteins from a proteome-wide perspective. Using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro expression cloning system, we have successfully identified eleven proteins that interact with p62's UBA domain, and the majority of the eleven proteins are associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, p62 may play a novel regulatory role through its UBA domain. Our approach provides an easy route to the characterization of UBA domain interacting proteins and its application will unfold the important roles that the UBA domain plays.",

            "text": "p62 is a novel cellular protein which was initially identified in humans as a phosphotyrosine independent ligand of the src homology 2 (SH2) domain of p56 lck (1, 2) . p56 lck is a member of the c-src family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that is found predominantly in cells of lymphoid origin (3, 4) . In addition to the interaction with p56 lck , p62 also associates with the Ser/Thr kinase (1, 2) , atypical protein kinase C (5, 6) , and ubiquitin (7) . In addition to the SH2 domain, p62 possesses several structural motifs, including a ubiquitin associated (UBA) domain that is capable of binding ubiquitin nonconvalently (8, 9) . Ubiquitin (Ub) is a small polypeptide of 76 amino acids that can be convalently attached to other proteins at specific lysine residues through chains composed of one (mono) or several ubiquitin moieties (poly). In addition to its classical role in protein degradation, ubiquitin is emerging as a signal for protein transport and processing (10) (11) (12) . Conjugation of ubiquitin to substrate proteins requires three enzymes: a ubiquitin activating enzyme E1, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, and a ubiquitin ligase E3. Initially, E1 activates ubiquitin by forming a high energy thioester intermediate with the C-terminal glycine using ATP. The activated ubiquitin is sequentially transferred to E2, then to E3 which catalyzes isopeptide bond formation between the activated C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin and \u03b5-amino group of a lysine residue of the substrate. Following the linkage of the first ubiquitin chain, additional molecules of ubiquitin are attached to lysine side chains of the previously conjugated moiety to form branched polyubiquitin chains. The fate of ubiquitinated substrates depends on the number of ubiquitin moieties conjugated, as well as, the lysine linkage of Ub-Ub conjugation. The conjugation of ubiquitin to eukaryotic intracellular proteins is one way in which those proteins are targeted to the proteasome for subsequent rapid degradation. This mechanism is particularly important for short-lived regulatory proteins such as cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinase-inhibitors, p53, the nuclear factor kappa B precursor, and I\u03baB (13) . The ubiquitinproteasome system consists of two steps: 1) the target protein is conjugated with polyubiquitin molecules, which mark the substrate for degradation; 2) the target protein is transferred to the 26S proteasome, unfolded and degraded.",

For example, polyubiquitination is required for the internalization of several yeast and mammalian cell surface proteins into the endocytic pathway (15, 16) . Interestingly, p62 appears to sequester ubiquitinated substrates into a cytoplasmic structure referred to as a sequestosome, into which excess ubiquitinated proteins are segregated (17) . In addition, p62 is an immediate early response gene product for a variety of signals (18) . Thus, p62 appears to play a novel regulatory role for polyubiquitinated proteins and may have an essential function in cell proliferation and differentiation.

Cells were harvested and lysed in 1 ml of SDS lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaF, 0.5% TX-100, 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 2 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin, 2 \u00b5g/ml leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF, 1% SDS) for 30 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0C to remove the insoluble fraction. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard.

The human adult brain library 96 well plates with 100 cDNAs per well were transcribed and translated employing the Gold TNT SP6 Express 96 plate in the presence of [ 35 S] methionine and ubiquitin (25 \u00b5g/\u00b5l, Sigma). By combining 4 protein pools as one mixed pool, 96 protein pools were divided into 24 mixed pools ( Fig. 2A,  2B ). Each lane contained more than 100 proteins (theoretically 400) with different molecular weight. Therefore, each lane appeared as a smear, indicating that the in vitro transcription/translation system from Promega worked successfully. In order to examine whether proteins synthesized in the IVEC system are also ubiquitinated, Western blot analysis was performed by blotting the newly synthesized proteins (in the presence of cold methionine instead of 35 S methionine) with ubiquitin monoclonal antibody. In the mixed protein pools, each of the 24 lanes appeared as a smear, indicating that proteins synthesized by the IVEC system are also ubiquitinated (Fig. 3A) . Furthermore, the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the IVEC system can utilize different lysine linkages of ubiquitin (i.e., Ub K29, Ub K48, and Ub K63) for ubiquitination (Fig. 3B) . In order to investigate whether the agarose-immobilised p62 UBA peptide has binding specificity, a mixed protein pool synthesized by IVEC system was tested in a pull down assay in the presence of agarose beads alone or in the presence of p62 UBA agarose beads (Fig. 3C ). Our results revealed that proteins that bound to p62's UBA domain could not be pulled down by agarose beads alone, indicating that the agarose-immobilised p62 UBA peptide had binding specificity. ",

Out of the 24 mixed protein pools, several pools contained [ 35 S] methionine-labeled bands in the primary p62 UBA pull down assays (Fig. 4) . We chose 6 pools (pool # 2, 4, 8, 14, 20, 21) because of their stronger signal to specifically identify which individual protein pool in the mixed pools has the ability to bind to p62's UBA domain. Therefore, a secondary screen was conducted on the 6 positive individual mixed pools (representing 24 individual protein pools) which bound with p62's UBA domain (Fig. 5) . Mixed protein pool # 2 generated a positive protein with molecular weight of 51 KDa (Fig. 4) , and only individual protein pool \"c\" out of the four protein pools (a, b, c, d) that comprised protein pool #2 had a protein with the same molecular weight (Fig. 5) . Depending on the size of the protein pulled down in the secondary screen compared to the primary screen (Fig. 4) , individual protein pools \"c\", \"h\", \"i\", \"o\", \"t\", and \"v\" were identified (Fig. 5) . To specifically identify which protein in the individual protein pool has the ability to bind p62's UBA domain, the cDNAs from the positive individual protein pools were then transformed into JM109 competent cells and plated out on LB ampicillin plates. Individual colonies were chosen to grow overnight in 1 ml of LB media plus ampicillin. Plasmid DNAs were purified from the cell culture and used for TNT Quick coupled in vitro transcription/translation. The individual protein synthesized from each plasmid DNA was retested for its ability to bind p62's UBA domain. By synthesizing individual protein from individual plasmid using the Gold TNT Quick coupled in vitro transcription/translation system and subjecting them to p62 UBA pull-down assays, 11 positive clones were isolated from the 6 positive individual pools. It is not surprising that 5 more clones showed binding ability with p62's UBA domain since there are 100 cDNAs in each positive individual pool and some of them could have lower binding ability and therefore showed weak signal in the mixed protein pool. It is also possible that they are not as efficiently synthesized in the mixed TNT reaction as in the individual TNT reaction in which only one cDNA was used as template. The 11 positive plasmids were sequenced and compared with known cDNA sequences in NCBI database using BLAST analysis with results shown in Table 1 .",

One set are proteins that are associated with Alzheimer's disease, including myelin basic protein, 14-3-3 protein, syntaxin binding protein munc18, transketolase, heat shock protein HSP70, reelin, and calcium/calmodulin kinase II (Table 1 ). Significant decrease in the amount of myelin basic protein has been reported in the white matter of Alzheimer's disease patients, accompanied by increased quantities of \u03b2amyloid peptides (21) . The presence of \u03b2-amyloid peptides containing senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the two major pathological features in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (22) . Interestingly, 14-3-3 proteins have also been demonstrated to be components of neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease brains (23) . Syntaxin binding protein munc18 can powerfully regulate amyloid precursor protein metabolism and \u03b2-amyloid secretion through direct and indirect interactions with X11 proteins (24) . The activity of transketolase has been reported to be reduced in dementia of Alzheimer's type brain (25) . Heat shock protein HSP70 expression is significantly increased in the temporal cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease (26) . Besides HSP70, other heat shock proteins are also linked with Alzheimer's disease. For example, increased synthesis of HSP27 has been suggested to play a role in preventing neuronal injury in AD (27) , and alpha-crystallin heat shock protein has a close relationship with neurofibrillary tangles of AD brains (28) . Reelin is a large secreted protein that controls cortical layering by signaling through the very low density lipoprotein receptor and apolipoprotein E receptor 2, thereby inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Disabled-1 (Dab1) and suppressing tau phosphorylation (29) . Neurofibrillary tangles comprised of highly phosphorylated tau proteins are a key component of Alzheimer's disease (30) . Enhanced activity of calcium/calmodulin kinase II has been suggested to contribute to phosphorylation of tau protein and lead to neurofibrillary tangle deposition and neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease (31) . Although the relationship between p62 and neurofibrillary tangles or neuritic plaques is unclear, both neurofibrillary tangles and dystrophic neuritis of neuritic plaques are associated with ubiquitin (32) , suggesting that dysfunction in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and the resulting accumulation of ubiquitinconjugated proteins may contribute to the origination of dystrophic neuritis and neurofibrillary tangles. Furthermore, p62 has been recently reported to accumulate early in neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease (33) , suggesting that p62 may play an important role in Alzheimer's disease by interacting with those proteins through its UBA domain.",

Unc51 like kinase II has been demonstrated to play a role in axonal elongation (35, 36) , which is needed for the formation of complicated neuronal networks. The third set of proteins that exhibit ability to bind p62's UBA domain are proteins that are linked with other neurodegenerative diseases, including FK506 binding proteins and nuclear receptor corepressor I (Table 1) . FK506 (tacrolimus) is a potent immunosuppressive drug used in the treatment of patients after organ transplantation and in selected autoimmune disorders (37) . FK506 is activated upon binding to members of the immunophilin family of proteins, which were designated as FK506 binding proteins (38) . Immunophilins are chaperone proteins and FK506 binding proteins have been suggested as therapeutics for neurological disorders (39, 40) . Nuclear receptor corepressor I has been suggested to play a role in Huntington's disease because it is able to interact with huntingtin (41) . The proteins identified here suggest that p62's UBA domain has the ability to interact with multiple proteins that play important roles in neurodegenerative diseases. Further screening from the whole genome-wide perspective will be necessary to define the important role that p62's UBA domain plays. ",

            "text": "It has been reported that polyubiquitin chains assembled through lysine 48 of ubiquitin act as a signal for substrate proteolysis by the 26S proteasome (42) (43) (44) . In order to understand whether the proteins identified in our screen bind to the p62's UBA domain through lysine 48 (K48), polyubiquitin K48 chains were added to the p62 UBA pull down assay (Fig. 6) . Inclusion of polyubiquitin K48 chains in the assay should compete for the binding of substrate to the p62's UBA domain and reduce the interaction of those proteins with the p62's UBA domain if those proteins are assembled through K48 chains. An alternative interpretation for polyubiquitin K48 chain competition is that the ubiquitin chains are competing for the same binding site as the binding partners which are either ubiquitinated or non-ubiquitinated. We randomly chose five proteins out of the 11 binding partners for the competition pull down (Fig. 6) . Out of the five proteins, four proteins (# 2, 3, 4, and 5) showed reduced binding ability with p62's UBA domain when polyubiquitin K48 chains were included (Fig. 6A, 6B ). However, K48 chains failed to compete with HSP70, suggesting that p62's UBA domain binds to HSP70 through a ubiquitin lysine linkage other than K48. Interestingly, it has been reported that heat shock protein 70 cognate (HSP70) is ubiquitinated by CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) via ubiquitin chain synthesis that uses either K29 or K63 (45) . In order to examine which lysine linkage utilized by HSP70 binds to p62's UBA domain, in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed by incubating lysates from HEK cells expressing HSP70 with E1, E2, and E3 in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT, 2 mM ATP). As control, the ubiquitination of HSP70 utilizing the rabbit reticulocyte lysate was also investigated by Western blot analysis. Our results revealed that HSP70 was ubiquitinated in the IVEC system (Fig.  7A, 7B) , and the rabbit reticulocyte lysate contained enzymes such as TRAF6 (E3) and UbcH7 (E2) for in vitro ubiquitination (Fig. 7C ). TRAF6 was chosen as an E3 in this in vitro ubiquitination assay due to its RING domain, a common feature of E3 ligases, and the observation that p62 is a scaffold for TRAF6 interaction (46) . Therefore, in vitro ubiquitination assays using the E1-E2-E3 system were performed in the presence of either ubiquitin wild type or ubiquitin mutants (K29R, K48R, and K63R). If one lysine mutant blocks the ubiquitination of HSP70, it would suggest that the ubiquitination of HSP70 utilizes that specific lysine linkage.",

            "text": "Our results revealed that HSP70 utilizes K63 linkage to assemble polyubiquitin chains to bind to p62's UBA domain since only the K63R ubiquitin mutant blocked the ubiquitination of HSP70 (Fig. 8A) . A similar result was also observed when reactions were conducted with wild type ubiquitin or mutant ubiquitin with all lysines mutated to arginines except K63 and the ubiquitination of HSP70 occurred only in the reaction that has either intact K63 ubiquitin or wild type ubiquitin (Fig. 8B ). This finding is consistent with previous reports (45) , demonstrating that HSP70 is K63-polyubiquitinated. Furthermore, the in vivo interaction of HSP70 and p62 was confirmed by transfecting myc-tagged HSP70 into HEK 293 cells in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and subjecting cell lysates to p62 immunoprecipitation and Western blot with anti-myc antibody (Fig. 8C) . The interaction between HSP70 and p62 in vivo took place only when MG132 was included, suggesting that the interaction in vivo is dependent upon the ubiquitination of HSP70. The specific type of polyubiquitin chain recognized by p62's UBA domain is not yet known and studies are underway lab to determine p62's interaction with specific polyubiquitin chains, however, our preliminary studies suggest that p62's UBA domain may recognize K63 linked polyubiquitin chains. Protein was synthesized employing TNT Quick Coupled in vitro transcription/translation system in the presence of ubiquitin, resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and western blotted with ubiquitin monoclonal antibody. B: HSP70 Protein was synthesized employing TNT Quick Coupled in vitro transcription/translation system in the presence of ubiquitin and 35 S-methionine, resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and exposed to X-ray film. C: Western blot of rabbit reticulocyte lysate with TRAF6 (E3) and UbcH7 (E2). In summary, for the first time, we demonstrate a systematic approach to identify UBA domain binding proteins from a proteome wide perspective. This approach could be readily adapted to high throughput screening. Using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro expression cloning system, we have successfully identified eleven proteins in the human adult brain that interact with the UBA domain of p62, and the majority of the eleven proteins are associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. This is a very interesting finding since 9600 cDNAs have been screened and only 11 of them showed binding specificity with p62's UBA domain. Studies are underway to unfold the functional roles of p62 in the ubiquitin system. Our approach provides an easy route to the characterization of UBA domain binding proteins at the level of the whole proteome, its application will unfold the important roles that p62's UBA domain plays. This method could be easily adapted to identify proteins that interact with other UBA domains as well.",
