            "text": "Using a large data set (n = 811), the relationship between acute respiratory infection illness severity and inflammatory biomarkers was investigated to determine whether certain symptoms are correlated more closely than others with the inflammatory biomarkers, interleukin-8 (IL-8) and nasal neutrophils. Participants with community acquired acute respiratory infection underwent nasal lavage for IL-8 and neutrophil testing, in addition to multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods for the detection and identification of respiratory viruses. Information about symptoms was obtained throughout the duration of the illness episode using the well-validated Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-21). Global symptom severity was calculated by the area under the curve (AUC) plotting duration versus WURSS total. Of the specimens tested, 56% were positively identified for one or more of nine different respiratory viruses. During acute respiratory infection illness, both IL-8 and neutrophils positively correlate with AUC (r s = 0.082, P = 0.022; r s = 0.080, P = 0.030). IL-8 and neutrophils correlate with nasal symptom severity: runny nose (r = 0.13, P = <0.00001; r = 0.18, P = <0.003), plugged nose (r = 0.045, P = 0.003; r = 0.14, P = 0.058), and sneezing (r = \u22120.02, P = <0.0001; r = \u22120.0055, P = 0.31). Neutrophils correlate with some quality of life measures such as sleeping well (r = 0.15, P = 0.026). Thus, the study demonstrates that IL-8 and neutrophils are correlated with severity of nasal symptoms during acute respiratory infection. Further research is necessary to determine if the concentration of these or other biomarkers can predict the overall duration and severity of acute respiratory infection illness.",

The most common causative agent is rhinovirus, but several other respiratory viruses are also known to cause acute respiratory illness [Gwaltney, 1985] . Acute respiratory infection is a common occurrence, yet detrimental to well-being. Moreover, there is currently no cure or effective treatment option available [Cohen et al., 1993; Carter, 2002] . Symptoms of acute respiratory infection illness can be examined three-dimensionally in the following groups: nasal, throat, and quality of life . These unpleasant, and sometimes, severe symptoms cause people to miss work and to utilize healthcare services, which places a notable burden on the individual and society [Fendrick et al., 2003; Eccles, 2005; Fiore et al., 2010; Ebell and Afonso, 2011] .",

            "text": "For many years, it has been known that some inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8), play a role in the pathophysiology of the common cold, as levels are found to increase in individuals sick with viral rhinitis compared to healthy individuals [Choi and Jacoby, 1992; Becker et al., 1993; Noah et al., 1995; R\u00f6seler et al., 1995; Gern et al., 1996; Johnston et al., 1997; Zhu et al., 1997; Kaul et al., 2000; Parry et al., 2000] . Within the immune system, IL-8 acts to recruit and activate neutrophils, contributing to inflammation [Naclerio et al., 1988; Teran et al., 1997; Zeilhofer and Schorr, 2000; Turner, 2001] . However, little work has been done to correlate IL-8 concentrations with specific acute respiratory infection symptoms and degree of illness. This paper presents important novel research boasting over 800 common cold cases with biomarkers and detailed records of acute respiratory infection severity making the breadth of our study unique. Additionally, not only is the relationship of the biomarkers with overall illness severity examined, but also more than 20 separate symptoms are considered one by one, and in meaningful clusters, in order to hone in on exactly what the relationship is between inflammatory biomarkers and certain cold symptoms. By investigating the relationship between acute respiratory infection illness severity and inflammatory biomarkers, the intent was to determine whether certain symptoms correlate more closely than others with inflammatory biomarkers such as IL-8 and nasal neutrophils. An additional aim was to gain insight into the predictability of overall severity and duration of acute respiratory infection episodes based on change in IL-8 and neutrophil levels during the first 3 days of illness.",

Nasal specimens were obtained by performing nasal lavage, and were used for analysis of IL-8 and neutrophils as indicators of nasal inflammation. Nasal lavage specimens were also used for PCR-based viral identification. In both trials, IL-8 concentrations were measured in picograms per milliliter (pg/ml) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test (ELISA), according to manufacturer's protocol. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes were counted using a standard hemocytometer in both trials, and expressed as neutrophils per milliliter (PMN/ml). Multiplex PCR methods developed and validated at UW-Madison were used to detect and identify respiratory viruses in nasal wash samples. With this accurate high-throughput assay, over 100 rhinovirus serotypes, as well as serotypes of influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, and metapneumovirus can be identified.

They determined that IL-8 is a major cytokine of human nasal epithelium, constitutively expressed and readily produced upon virus infection. RSV has also been found to increase both IL-8 gene expression in human lung epithelial A549 cells [Fiedler et al., 1995] , and IL-8 release by buffy coat cells, especially in the presence of lung surfactant protein A [Hickling et al., 2000] . Another study showed that adenovirus-induced Raf/MAPK activation contributes to IL-8 production [Bruder and Kovesdi, 1997 ]. Additionally influenza virus A has been determined to induce interleukin-8 expression in human airway epithelial cells [Choi and Jacoby, 1992] .",

The current findings support and extend the known role of IL-8 in acute respiratory infection. In addition to showing IL-8 concentrations are high in individuals with acute respiratory infection, the current results show that the IL-8 concentration correlates with symptom severity.

Several authors have reported a direct correlation between the severity of symptoms associated with in vitro rhinovirus infection and the concentration of interleukin-8 in nasal secretions. Biagioli et al. examined the mechanism of rhinovirus-induced IL-8 response and suggested that mediation occurs through production of oxidative species and the subsequent activation of NF-kappaB [Biagioli et al., 1999] . That study was carried out in vitro. The current study supports that study's findings and is more clinically applicable, as infections were naturally community-acquired and are correlated with symptom severity. Global severity, measured by AUC, was found to correlate with biomarker concentrations of IL-8 and neutrophils. Gern and colleagues report IL-8 production contributes to acute respiratory infection symptom severity in children with rhinovirus or influenza A infection [Gern et al., 2002] . While this study used a different symptom scale, it too found that IL-8 correlated with acute respiratory infection severity when all the acute respiratory infection episodes reported in the studied adult population are considered. Among these 811 episodes, nine types of viruses were identified. An analysis by viral type was tried, but once divided by virus the number of acute respiratory infection episodes in each group had insufficient power to draw conclusions.",

One study examined the association between experimental rhinovirus infection and the elaboration of IL-8 into nasal secretions, and also looked at rhinovirus-associated common cold symptoms [Turner et al., 1998 ].

Neutrophils correlated with scratchy throat and two quality of life symptoms: thinking clearly and sleeping well. The scratchy throat correlation with IL-8 and neutrophils could be explained as a result of postnasal drip triggered by acute respiratory infection. The correlation between neutrophils and sleep quality is an interesting issue. Healthy individuals who are sleep deprived are known to have increased neutrophils [Boudjeltia et al., 2008; Ruiz et al., 2012] . Similarly, night shift workers have been found to have increased levels of inflammatory markers, including neutrophils, compared to individuals who work day shift [Alireza et al., 2011] . Additionally, individuals with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) have a higher percentage of sputum neutrophils compared to normal controls [Lacedonia et al., 2011] . All of these examples imply that the poor sleep leads to the neutrophil increase. However, during an acute respiratory infection the neutrophils are likely due to the infection, which leads to poor sleep quality. Nasal symptoms due to neutrophil infiltrated non-allergic rhinitis have been shown to have a large effect on sleep quality and quality of life [Gelardi et al., 2008] . Even though the participants we studied exhibit a different disease state than sleep apnea, it shows an important and consistent relationship between nasal symptoms and sleep quality. Likely, the poor sleep quality is due to nasal neutrophils, but our study does not allow us to determine if the poor sleep quality is a result of the nasal neutrophils, or if the nasal neutrophils are a result of the poor sleep quality.",

IL-8 has been shown to be linked to clearance of a porcine respiratory virus [Lunney et al., 2010] , and one study suggests that neutrophils do not play an important role in viral clearance during influenza virus infection in mice [Wareing et al., 2007] . Furthermore, investigators have run human experiments that attempt to determine predictability of acute respiratory infection severity or duration. One group of researchers asked clinicians and patients to predict the severity and duration of acute respiratory infection at an initial visit and had the patient complete the WURSS [Longmier et al., 2013] . There was no significant association found between participant and clinician predictions of severity or duration with the actual severity and duration of acute respiratory infection. In order to answer a similar question about predictability of cold severity, time-points analysis that looked at IL-8 and neutrophil levels on Day 1 of the acute respiratory infection episode was performed in relationship to WURSS score on Day 3 of the acute respiratory infection episode. The analysis gave insignificant results. Therefore, while IL-8 is indicative of inflammation, it may not be a mediator affecting the chronological course of colds. Further research is necessary to determine if the concentration or change in concentration of cytokines throughout an acute respiratory infection episode can predict the overall duration and severity of the illness. For example, specimens from additional time points could be assayed, and a larger array of cytokines could be measured in order to create a better model of the importance of cells and cytokines for the mediation of symptoms and the control of viral replication. This insight could be useful for prevention and treatment options focusing on shortening the length of a cold, and abating symptoms.",
