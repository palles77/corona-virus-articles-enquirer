The onset and duration of immunity they stimulate is similar to that induced by a natural infection and, therefore, is usually more rapid and durable. Because the vaccine viruses are living, a single small dose is amplified by replication in the host. Viral replication promotes persistent antigenic stimulation of antibody protection and CMI. Modified live virus vaccines may be administered by the natural route of infection, thereby inducing local immunity such as secretory IgA. 3 \u2022 24 \u2022 77 They are also more efficient stimulants ofboth local and systemic CMI. Examples are oral rabies vaccine for foxes, 8 \u2022 9 \u00b7u 6 an intranasal FVR-FCV product for cats, 29 and an aerosol vaccine for mink distemper. 48 Some attenuated vaccines such as canine adenovirus-2 apparently can produce local immunity when administered parenterally. 3 Because the onset of immunity is rapid with MLV vaccines, they have a distinct advantage in controlling outbreaks where a number of animals are assembled. Examples include distemper on mink farms, parvovirus in kennels, and respiratory viruses in catteries.",

Killed vaccines must be evaluated quantitatively for their immunogenicity and qualitatively for residual infectivity. 76 Advantages. The most important advantage of KV vaccines is safety. Killed viruses do not replicate in the host and, therefore, eliminate the reversion to virulence or the inclusion of pathogenic virions in the inoculum. Any contaminants are inactivated with the production virus. Recent studies have shown that adjuvants may potentiate the cell-mediated immune response 84 and enhance immunogenicity by retention of the killed antigen within the host. Killed vaccines are indicated for pregnant animals, colostrum-deprived neonates, or stressed, immunosuppressed, or otherwise debilitated animals. 50 Disadvantages. The most frequently cited disadvantage of killed vaccines is the type and duration of immune response that they evoke. The protection is generally of shorter duration, and multiple inoculations are usually required. If the animal is \"incompletely\" immunized, subsequent exposure to virulent virus may result in a mild or inapparent infection followed by an anamnestic response. 19 Killed vaccines require a large antigenic mass and, with the inevitable inclusion of nonviral material, repeated inoculation may lead to hypersensitivity reactions. 50 Occasionally, allergic responses occur with subsequent infection by virulent virus.",

The sight hounds, such as the Greyhound and Afghan Hound, seem especially susceptible. 1! 4 The pathogenesis of the lesions was described by Carmichael. 16 \u00b7 17 He injected immune serum intraocularly in dogs given attenuated CAV-1 vaccine. The virus-antibody-complement complexes attract macrophages that release enzymes and damage corneal endothelium, resulting in corneal edema and keratitis (\"blue eye\"). Although the tendency to induce ocular lesions may vary among CAY -1 strains, attenuated CAV-2 viruses do not produce similar lesions. 10 \u2022 109 To demonstrate the safety of modified live CAV-2 for use as an alternate vaccine for ICH immunization, Curtis and Barnett 28 inoculated dogs intravenously with large doses (greater than 10 8 TCID 50 ) of either modified live CAV-1 or modified live CAV-2. Four of 10 dogs inoculated with modified live CAV-1 had gross ocular lesions, whereas dogs inoculated with CAV-2 had neither gross nor histopathologic ocular changes.

Postvaccinal encephalomyelitis is especially severe in the cat. 47 More recently, vaccines have been produced from tissues of immature animals (suckling mouse brain, hamster embryo, and duck embryo), which reduced the incidence of aberrant antigen-induced encephalomyelitis.

Post-vaccinal canine distemper encephalitis has been reported under varying circumstances. 2 \u2022 68 \u00b7 109 It has been observed in very young or immunosuppressed dogs 109 and in dogs with CPV-2 infections. 68 Reversion to virulence by the canine distemper vaccine virus has been reported by Goto and colleagues 49 and by Appel. 2 At this writing, the question of whether modified live CDV vaccines can immunosuppress and interfere with the successful immunization of modified live CPV-2 (or the converse) has not been resolved. Canine parvovirus infection was enhanced by the administration of a modified live CDV-CAV-1 vaccine several days before experimental infection with CPV -2. 100 On the other hand, distemper encephalitis was demonstrated in gnotobiotic puppies vaccinated with a CDV-CAV-2-CPI-Leptospira bacterin product several days before oronasal inoculation with virulent CPV-2. 68 A modified live CCV vaccine was available commercially in 1983 for a short period of time. When administered with a monovalent modified live CPV vaccine, no complications arose. However, when administered simultaneously with a modified live CDV, an encephalitis ensued. At this time, there is no published information demonstrating whether the encephalitis was caused by CCV alone or induced by immunosuppression by CDV with subsequent CCV encephalitis. The killed CCV vaccine does not replicate within the host, but Evermann 39 recommends conservative use of the new product until its efficacy is determined through field use. He suggests vaccination of high-risk dogs in research facilities, kennels, and shelters as well as vaccination of pregnant bitches to promote colostral CCV antibody production to protect puppies. Swango 120 claims that the highly attenuated chicken embryo tissue culture origin (CETCO) CDV vaccine is safer than and as efficacious as CDV vaccines of canine origin.",

Greene 50 offers guidelines for immunizing young puppies and preventing their exposure to virulent CPV-2. Wallace and McMillen 125 and Wallace and colleagues 126 demonstrated that the new killed CPV-2 vaccine of high antigenic mass can effectively immunize dogs and puppies for 1 year if given two initial doses 21 days apart. Wallace and colleagues 126 successfully combined the killed CPV-2 with Leptospira canicola and L. icterohaemorrhagiae bacterin and used them in a diluent to reconstitute a lyophilized CDV-CAV-2-CPI vaccine. They recommend use of the killed CPV-2 product in order to avoid viral replication in the intestine and shedding of virus in the feces.",
