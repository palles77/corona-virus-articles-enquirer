The World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic and rates the global risk assessment as very high.A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative (3) .Timely and accurate diagnosis of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to isolate and care for these patients early are of great importance for interrupting human-to-human transmission, and limiting further spread of the virus. Common laboratory abnormalities in confirmed COVID-19 cases include decreased white blood cells, lymphocytes, and platelet counts, and an increased LDH, CK, and CRP levels (4) (5) . And the reported common clinical symptoms include fever, cough, myalgia or fatigue (6) . However, these abnormalities and symptoms are not unique features of COVID-19 since these might be similar to that of other virus infected disease. Meanwhile, some infected patients are asymptomatic but can also become a source of infection, which makes early diagnosis essential.",

Effective diagnosis that identify SARS-CoV-2 infection in people are of great importance for public health efforts, not just for individuals' health concerns. Patients' clinical manifestations mainly included fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Diagnosis could be based on clinical history, laboratory and CT images, but confirmation primarily relies on nucleic acid detection. Yet many novel coronavirus pneumonia patients can not be diagnosed due to negative nucleic acid test. For example, throat swab is commonly used for nucleic acid test, while the viral loads in upper respiratory tract samples are usually much lower than that in lower respiratory tract samples in COVID-19 cases, and the viral loads of patients varies in different stage of illness (17) .",

The human immune system can produce specific IgM and IgG antibodies against virus infection. IgM is the earliest antibody that appears upon first immune response. Serological presence of IgM indicates a recent infection and could be used as auxiliary diagonosis of early infection. IgG is produced later and lasts long, which can be used as an indicator of previous or secondary infection (18) (19) . In this study, the positive rate of throat swabs was only 13.0% for cases in later phase( \u2265 15 d.a.o), and the sensitivities of IgM and IgG were 52.2% and 91.3%, respectively. Combining use of antibodies assay at the same time could be able to greatly improve the sensitivities of pathogenic-diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially for the throat swabs group during the later stage of illness.Moreover, through further analysis of the antibodies test data of cases with undetectable viral RNA in throat swabs specimens at the early stage of illness, we suggest that most of these cases could be IgM/IgG seropositive after 7 days of negative nucleic acid test results, indicating an auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies assays.",

Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (5th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China. Specimens including throat swabs, sputum and serum were collected during the hospitalization period.Viral RNAs and serum IgM-IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were measured by qRT-PCR (Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay) and GICA assay (Colloidal Gold Antibodies Test), respectively. This study was approved by the National Health Commission of China and Ethics Commission of the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang. Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of the designated hospital for emerging infectious disease and the urgent need to collect data.",

(2) Criteria for SARS-CoV-2-infection interpretation: \u2460 Both of the two genes (ORFla / b, N) of SARS-CoV-2 in one specimen were positive; \u2461 Cases with a single positive gene required confirmation by retesting. If it is still positive for the same single target, it is determined to be positive.If not, it is determined to be negative.These diagnostic criteria were based on the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention of China (http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/kyjz/202001/t20200121_211337.html).",

Two patients remained seronegative for antibodies testing during hospitalization.Both of the them are close contacts. Case 1 was a female aged 15 with no fever or fatigue, no symptoms of digestive system, and no significant change in lymphocyte subsets counts during the course of disease. The antibodies test still showed to be seronegative in the 14 days following hospital discharge. Case 2 was a female aged 40 with a fever, body temperature up to 38.2\u2103 in the onset of illness. CT scan of chest showed a sign of inflammation, accompanied by an increased T-lymphocyte subsets counts and a decreased NK cells counts.
