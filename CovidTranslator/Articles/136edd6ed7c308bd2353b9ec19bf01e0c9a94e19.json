            "text": "Dengue is the world's most common mosquito-borne viral infection and a leading cause of morbidity throughout the tropics and subtropics. Viruses are known to evade the establishment of an antiviral state by regulating the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a critical transcription factor in the alpha/beta interferon induction pathway. Here, we show that dengue virus (DENV) circumvents the induction of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor (RLR) pathway during infection by blocking serine 386 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3. This effect is associated with the expression of nonstructural 2B/3 protein (NS2B/3) protease in human cells. Using interaction assays, we found that NS2B/3 interacts with the cellular IB kinase (IKK). Docking computational analysis revealed that in this interaction, NS2B/3 masks the kinase domain of IKK and potentially affects its functionality. This observation is supported by the DENV-associated inhibition of the kinase activity of IKK. Our data identify IKK as a novel target of DENV NS2B/3 protease.",

            "text": "The innate immune response is the first line of defense against invading pathogens, and it is activated in mammalian hosts immediately after viral infection. This response is triggered when cell pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), leading to the activation of multiple signaling pathways and transcription factors (6) . Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) are important PRRs that recognize the viral replication intermediate, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (7) . The RLR family comprises cytoplasmic RNA helicases that share a homologous DExD/H box. The two principal members are RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) (8) . The binding of dsRNA to PRRs activates interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a key transcription factor that induces the production of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-\u2423/\u2424) (type I IFNs). Both types of dsRNA receptors utilize adaptor molecules to facilitate signaling: TLR3 uses Toll interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-\u2424 (TRIF) and RLR signals through mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), also called IPS1, VISA, and CARDIF (6) . TRIF and MAVS interact with TANKbinding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IB kinase \u03b5 (IKK\u03b5) independently of the activated dsRNA receptor. Downstream, the kinases phosphorylate IRF3 at several serine/threonine residues, thereby promoting its dimerization and translocation into the nucleus (6, 9) . This phosphorylation leads to the activation of multiple genes, including IFN-\u2424, which is crucial to the establishment of the antiviral state that blocks viral replication.",

Members of the family Flaviviridae, like hepatitis C virus (HCV) and West Nile virus (WNV), also have evolved unique strategies to control the innate immune response in order to prevent viral clearance and promote viral replication (16) . Dengue virus has been shown to inhibit the type I IFN signaling cascade by targeting different proteins of the Janus kinasesignal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway (17, 18) . In particular, the nonstructural DENV proteins NS2A, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 have been involved in that inhibitory effect (19) (20) (21) (22) . Different studies have demonstrated that the HCV serine protease NS3/4A cleaves the adaptors TRIF and MAVS (23, 24) . Other viruses use their proteases to disrupt the IFN pathways; for example, the picornavirus 3Cpro cleaves RIG-I and abrogates its activity (25) . Recently, it was shown that DENV NS2B/3 inhibits the type I IFN response in human dendritic cells by cleaving STING (26) .

            "text": "DENV infection results in inhibition of RLR-induced IRF3 nuclear translocation. Previous works confirmed that following cellular stimulation of a PRR, the IKK\u03b5 and TBK1 kinases phosphorylate IRF3, which then homodimerizes and rapidly translocates to the nucleus (6, 33) . To analyze DENV-associated nuclear translocation of IRF3, we compared DENV-and mock-infected 293/TLR3 cells by using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. The results demonstrate nuclear translocation of IRF3 after TLR3 or RLR stimulation occurs in mock-infected cells ( Fig. 2B and C) compared to unstimulated control cells ( Fig. 2A) . Similarly, in the DENV-infected/unstimulated cells, nuclear translocation of IRF3 did not occur (Fig. 2D) . However, in the DENV-infected/stimulated cells, RLR-induced IRF3 nuclear translocation was blocked (Fig. 2F) and there was moderate inhibition of TLR3-induced IRF3 nuclear translocation (Fig. 2E) . To determine if the observed decrease in nuclear translocation is related to DENV-associated suppression of IRF3 activation, we performed the same experiments but used a specific pS386-IRF3 antibody. Control cells that were mock infected and unstimulated showed no presence of pS386-IRF3 (Fig. 2G) , whereas both TLR3 and RLR stimulation induced S386-IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in mock-infected cells (Fig. 2H and I) . The phosphorylation of S386-IRF3 was not detected in either the cytoplasm or nucleus of DENV-infected/unstimulated cells (Fig.  2J) . However, although the virus failed to block TLR3-induced IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation (Fig. 2K) , it strongly antagonized RLR-induced S386-IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear localization (Fig. 2L ). This is in agreement with the results obtained with the anti-IRF3 antibody ( Fig. 2A to F) . Because of the robust and significant blockage of RLR-induced S386-IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation by the DENV virus, this pathway was chosen for study in all further experiments. DENV NS2B/3 protease inhibits S386-IRF3 phosphorylation. Recently, it was demonstrated that the DENV catalytically active protease complex NS2B/3 antagonizes the type I IFN response in human cells (34) . To further address the role of the catalytic activity of DENV NS2B/3 in suppressing RLR-induced S386-IRF3 phosphorylation in 293/TLR3 cells, we performed immunoblotting of cells transfected with plasmids coding for either a wild-type DENV protease or a mutant variant with a single amino acid substitution, Ser135 replaced with Ala (S135A), which eliminates the protease activity (35) (Fig. 3A) . A densitometric analysis of a pS386-IRF3 immunoblot of lysate from RLR-stimulated cells transfected with an empty plasmid showed a 3.1-fold level of induction compared with negative-control cells (Fig. 3B) . However, in lysates of NS2B/3-transfected cells stimulated for RLR, the induction of pS386-IRF3 was significantly reduced compared to the positive-control (\u03e9C) cells that received only stimulation (P \u03fd 0.05) (Fig. 3B ). Of note, cells transfected with NS2B/3-S135A were found to have lower levels of RLR-induced pS386-IRF3, but the degree of reduction was not significant compared to that of the \u03e9C cells.",

The NS2B/3-associated inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation establishes the relevance of studying the interplay between the protease and kinases that directly activate IRF3. To further address this, we performed interaction assays between NS2B/3 and IKK\u03b5, which is a kinase involved in phosphorylating IRF3. First, we used the in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA), a technique based on immunodetection that identifies any interaction between two proteins in close proximity by generating fluorescence. The cells were transfected with plasmids coding for HA-tagged NS2B/3 or NS2B/3-S135A or were cotransfected with Flag-tagged IKK\u03b5 (Fig. 4) . Using the same method, we were able to detect single proteins as evidence of the individual expression of IRF3, IKK\u03b5, HA-tagged NS2B/3, and NS2B/3-S135A (Fig. 4A , panels a to d). Once expression of the single proteins was confirmed, we tested whether any protein-protein interactions could be detected. As a positive control for interacting proteins, we used the cyclic AMP response element-binding (CREB)-binding protein/p300 (CBP/p300) and IRF3, which are well-described protein-protein partners (36) . We first looked at cells that were transfected with any form of the protease and analyzed them for interactions between the protease and endogenous IKK\u03b5 (Fig. 4A , The 293/TLR3 cells were infected or mock infected with DENV and stimulated or not for TLR3 or RLR as indicated. The cells were dually labeled for DENV and IRF3 (A to C, mock infected; D to F, DENV infected) or pS386-IRF3 (G to I, mock infected; J to L, DENV infected). Cells were stained with fluorescent, conjugated secondary antibodies and observed by confocal microscopy.

To determine if IKK\u03b5 is a substrate of DENV NS2B/3 protease, we conducted a computational analysis to identify putative protease cleavage sites within the IKK\u03b5 sequence. We identified two putative cleavage sites, one in the N terminus of the protein, specifically in the ATP-binding region of the kinase domain between residues 30 and 31, and the other in the C terminus between residues 559 and 560 (Fig. 5A) . We then evaluated if IKK\u03b5 expression was regulated or showed cleavage products after NS2B/3 transfection or DENV infection. We performed Western blot analysis of the cells cotransfected with plasmids coding for N-terminally Flag-tagged IKK\u03b5 and HA-tagged NS2B/3 or NS2B/3-S135A and used two different antibodies to increase the chance of detecting the potential cleavage products of IKK\u03b5. The antibodies used were an anti-Flag antibody that can recognize the transfected protein and any N-terminal cleavage product and a monoclonal anti-IKK\u03b5 antibody that recognizes residues surrounding Val345 and that will therefore detect cleavage products containing those residues. The results show that IKK\u03b5 was equally expressed in cells transfected with NS2B/3 or NS2B/3-S135A. Furthermore, we detected only unique specific bands with no presence of cleavage products using two different antibodies (Fig. 5B ). This effect was also observed in DENV-infected cells, in which neither IKK\u03b5 endogenous expression was regulated nor its cleavage products detected after DENV infection (Fig. 5C) .",

Similarly, the viral polymerase NS5 binds STAT2 to induce its proteasomal degradation and thereby inhibits IFN responses (22, 41) .

The roles of specific phosphorylation sites of IRF3 are a subject of some controversy; however, it is clear that IRF3 has two important phosphorylation sites: site 1, which includes S385 and S386, and site 2, which principally includes S396 and S398 (30) . The data support a two-step phosphorylation model where phosphorylation at S396 results in IRF3 dimerization and the removal of an autoinhibitory structure that allows the dimer to interact with the coactivator CBP/p300, which in turn facilitates phosphorylation at S385 or S386 (43) . In this study, we sought to determine whether DENV regulates IRF3 phosphorylation at S386, which has been suggested to be a major determinant of IRF3 activation (31) . Western blot analysis demonstrated that after DENV infection of 293/TLR3 cells, the virus has the ability to actively block RLR-induced IRF3 activation by inhibiting S386-IRF3 phosphorylation. We also observed a moderate impact on S386 phosphorylation when the TLR3 pathway was stimulated (Fig. 1) . These results are supported by previous studies showing DENV inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation at S398 (44) . Taken together, these results suggest that DENV can inhibit IRF3 phosphorylation of at least two different serines of the IRF3 phosphoserine cluster necessary for its activation. The impact of HCV infection on the phosphorylation of IRF3 at different serine residues has also been assessed and was similarly found to inhibit the phosphorylation of both serines (45) .",

Furthermore, these studies showed that both the catalytically active and inactive forms of the protease coimmunoprecipitated with STING, which is in agreement with our observations. Those data and our results support that the viral protease in both its active and inactive forms interacts with at least two different proteins of the IFN induction pathway, namely, STING and IKK\u03b5. Studies that characterized the role of STING in the multiprotein complex that induces type I IFN revealed that STING dimerizes and acts as a scaffold protein to recruit IKK\u03b5/TBK1 and IRF3 (50, 51) . In this scenario, the DENV protease-mediated cleavage of STING alters the assembly of the complexes required for IRF3 activation and can thus explain the reduced IKK\u03b5-NS2B/3 interaction that we observed. However, in the absence of cleavage, the complex will still be stable, allowing a stronger IKK\u03b5-NS2B/3-S135A interaction.

We obtained evidence showing that the NS2B/3 protease interacts with IKK\u03b5, specifically with the kinase domain (Fig. 6) . The adopted conformation masks the protein kinase and ATP-binding domains by steric hindrance, which supports the previous observation of an interaction between the two proteins that is independent of the proteolytic activity of NS2B/3. This interaction model supports the experimental observation of a DENV-associated inhibition of IKK\u03b5 kinase function (Fig. 5D ). Our structural analyses are relevant because the interaction of NS2B/3 with IKK\u03b5 may not only affect the physical interaction of IRF3 with the kinase domain of IKK\u03b5, but it may also interfere with the access of other important proteins of the multiprotein complex that induces type I IFN transcription. A similar mechanism of inhibition has been described in another positivestranded RNA virus: the papain-like protease of coronavirus antagonizes the innate immunity by disrupting the assembly of the STING-MAVS-IKK\u03b5/TBK1 complex (11) . Thus, further studies with IKK\u03b5 may reveal the mechanistic details that modulate this innate immune response.",

DENV protease counteracts the IFN induction pathway through direct interaction with IKK\u03b5 by catalysis-dependent and -independent mechanisms interfering with the kinase activity of IKK\u03b5. DENV NS2B/3 plays a role in DENV pathogenicity, and therefore the knowledge gained by characterizing the mechanisms through which DENV evades innate immunity might provide insights that will spark the development of novel therapeutic strategies against this virus.",
