Eight groups of 30 male and 30 female rats were exposed 1 hr per day, 5 days per week for 13 weeks, to smoke from reference (tobacco burned) or test (tobacco only heated) cigarettes, at nicotine concentrations of 5, 15, or 30 &liter of air. Similar smoke concentrations of wet total particulate matter and carbon monoxide were produced in each of the teat/reference comparisons. There was a pronounced depression of minute ventilation of animals in the reference groups, but not in the test animals. Blood carboxyhemoglobin concentrations were similar in animals exposed to smoke from test and reference cigarettes. Plasma concentrations of nicotine and cotinine in the test groups were higher than in the reference groups. There were no differences between the smoke-exposed groups in terms of body weight or feed consumption. At necropsy, an increase in heart weight was noted in both high exposure groups. There were notable differences in histopathology, with fewer and less-pronounced changes in the test groups than in the reference groups. Many of the histopathological responses induced in the reference groups were absent in the test groups. Overall, the study demonstrated a substantial reduction in the biological activity of smoke from the test cigarette when compared with the reference. o 1989 society of Toxicology.",

A highly refined carbon heat source in the tip of the cigarette generates warm air that passes through tobacco, tobacco extract, flavorings, and glycerol to form smoke. The reference cigarettes were manufactured in house and consisted of blended Turkish, Burley, flue-cured, and reconstituted sheet tobaccos. They were air-diluted by both paper and filter ventilation to yield, under the FTC conditions described above, quantities of WTPM, carbon monoxide (CO), and nicotine that were similar to those yielded by the test cigarette. The reference cigarettes were, therefore, unlike any commercially available cigarette. On an analytical smoking machine, the FTC yields were approximately 10 mg WTPM, 11 mg CO, and 475 rg nicotine. Standard filters and cigarette papers were used. The relative humidities (RH) used in conditioning test and reference cigarettes were approximately 10% for the former and 50% for the latter, at room temperature for at least 48 hr prior to use in the animal studies. While full analytical chemistry was not performed on the smoke generated for inhalation exposures, such analysis has been performed on cigarettes similar to those used in this study (RJRT, 1988) .",

Differences in the \"bioavailability\" ofthe nicotine yielded by test and reference cigarettes have not been observed in subsequent work (Mosberg et al., 1989) . This latter work suggests that the reference cigarette used in the present work had a relatively low availability of nicotine (possibly, because of the special design), rather than the test cigarette having a high availability. The ratio of cotinine to nicotine indicates that the nicotine metabolism was approximately similar in the test and reference groups, with large variability in the data. Recent work in human subjects (deBethizy et al., 1988) has shown no differences between test and reference cigarettes in terms of resultant plasma nicotine concentrations, plasma cotinine, and the plasma cotinine to nicotine ratio. Plasma nicotine was shown to be directly proportional to the nicotine yield of the cigarette.",

Increased intraalveolar brown-gold macrophages were noted, in the high exposure reference groups only. Occasionally, these macrophages formed aggregates within an alveolus (Fig. 12) , as described previously (Kendrick et al., 1976; Coggins et al., 1980) . There were no significant group differences in the histopathology seen in the trachea, or in any of the other organs examined.In summary, after 90-days the following histopathological changes were Seen in the reference groups but were either absent or substantially reduced in the test groups: epithelial hyperplasia in Nasal I, squamous metaplasia of Nasal I and larynx, inflammation in Nasal I and larynx, olfactory atrophy in Nasal II, increased goblet cells in the conducting airways, pulmonary brown-gold macrophages, and pulmonary congestion. Many of the changes observed in the reference animals reversed completely by the end of the recovery period. The exposure-related changes which did not reverse completely in the reference animals were squamous meta-",
