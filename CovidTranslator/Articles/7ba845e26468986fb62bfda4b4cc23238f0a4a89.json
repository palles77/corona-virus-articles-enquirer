Studies on health behavior have revealed the weakness of the selfreport approach, for example, being subject to relativism, and influenced by engagement and culture [12] [13] [14] . Similarly, studies on organizational behavior in health promotion have uncovered the bias of self-reports including under-reporting inappropriate behaviors and overreporting appropriate behavior [15] . This tendency to respond in socially desirable ways has created a problem involving information accuracy. When the WHO uses IHR self-reported information to allocate resources to strengthen national capacity in infectious disease control, this might mislead the focus if the information is inaccurate [16] . Although external evaluation could partly solve the problem, understanding the reliability of national selfreported capacities is still important because it remains the main approach in collecting information from countries. However studies have rarely focused on the accuracy of national self-reported information.",

ProMED-mail is a nongovernmental emerging disease monitoring program established in 1994 to provide early warning about outbreaks based on information from various sources [19] . The credibility of ProMEDmail and its efforts on reporting timely information were repeatedly confirmed by several studies [20] [21] [22] . By collecting all sources of information including media reports, official reports, online summaries, local observers, and others without political constraints, reports on ProMEDmail is comprehensive. As an internet-based reporting system with electronic communications approach, the effect of reporting in a timely manner of ProMED-mail was also confirmed by previous study through comparing the timeliness of reporting form the WHO. Apart from the WHO, which reports \"a public health emergency of international concern\" regulated by IHR 2005, ProMED-mail aims at reporting all kinds of information on outbreaks of infectious diseases. Thus, we collected outbreak information from both websites to track countries' infectious disease control situations. Reports containing only animal disease outbreaks were also collected.",

Human development is defined as encompassing three dimensions: life expectancy at birth as an index of population health and longevity; knowledge and education as measured by the adult literacy rate and the combined primary, secondary and tertiary gross enrollment ratio and standard of living as measured by the natural logarithm of gross domestic product per capita at purchasing power parity. With indicators mainly collected from official statistics, the indexes of the three dimensions were expressed as a value between 0 and 1 by applying the general formula. Then the human development index was calculated as a simple average of the dimension indices ranging between 0 and 1, with 1 representing the highest degree of human development and 0 the lowest. We used the human development index of 2016 to represent the human development status of each country in that year. The details of methods to determine the values are described in the Technical Notes section of the report [24] .

Third, three diseases, i.e., avian flu, yellow fever, and MERS-CoV, together accounted for over 50% of the reports and outbreak reports were concentrated in specific countries. Therefore, the performance observed in these affected countries had a great impact on overall outcomes. The WHO sometimes reported eye-catching cases although it constituted just one case in one country. We might have under-rated the disease control outcomes in such cases, though rarely. Forth, countries' self-reported assessments were not validated. However, this is the reason why we conducted this study to see the reliability of such approach and information.

Among 84 countries (863 reports) had IHR scores in 2017, the average score of all indicators ranged from 68.23 to 91.95. For both IHR average scores of 2016 and 2017, zoonosis (94.42 in 2016 and 91.95 in 2017) and surveillance (93.55 in 2016 and 90.28 in 2017) were both within the top 3 capacities with high scores while points of entry (75.56 in 2016 and 68.23 in 2017) exhibited the lowest capacity score. Using standard deviation, points of entry and legislation were the top two capacities with the greatest gap among countries both in 2016 and 2017. And the most homogeneous capacity among countries was surveillance and zoonosis. In addition, zoonosis was the indicator reported as 100 by most of the countries both in 2016 and 2017 (n = 49), followed by legislation (n = 45 in 2016, n = 48 in 2017). Compared with IHR 2016, IHR average scores of 2017 is 1.26 point lower. And the average score of all indicators in 2017 were lower than scores in 2016.",
