A community-wide, respiratory outbreak of group G streptococcal pharyngitis in a pediatric population was described in which group G streptococcus was isolated from 56 of 222 (25%) consecutive children with acute pharyngitis seen in a private pediatric office [5] .

The rash often begins around the neck and spreads over the trunk and extremities. It is a diffuse, finely papular, erythematous eruption producing a bright red discoloration of the skin, which blanches on pressure. Involvement is often more intense along the creases of the elbows, axillae, and groin. The involved skin has a goose-pimple appearance and feels rough. The face is usually spared, although the cheeks may be erythematous with pallor around the mouth. After 3 to 4 days, the rash begins to fade and is followed by desquamation, first on the face, progressing downward, and often resembling that seen after a mild sunburn. Occasionally, sheetlike desquamation may occur around the free margins of the fingernails, palms, and soles. Examination of the pharynx of a patient with scarlet fever reveals essentially the same findings as with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis. In addition, the tongue usually is coated, and the papillae are swollen. After desquamation, the reddened papillae are prominent, giving the tongue a strawberry appearance.",

Because of considerable variability in study designs and culture techniques, it is difficult to compare the sensitivity of a RADT as determined in one study with the sensitivity of another RADT as determined in a different study [28] . The relative sensitivities of different RADTs can be determined only by direct comparisons.

In this study performed over three winter seasons and using the on-site physician office laboratory at the pediatric group practice, they found that the RADT had a sensitivity of approximately 85% compared with a single blood agar plate culture. The investigators concluded that the sensitivity of this particular RADT was too low for them to consider abandoning the confirmatory throat culture in their practice. In contrast, Mayes and Pichichero [36] reviewed the experience with RADTs in a different pediatric group practice between January 1996 and June 1999. During this period, 11,427 RADTs were performed, and 8385 (73.4%) were negative. A confirmatory blood agar plate culture was performed for 8234 (98.2%) of these 8385 negative tests. Of these, 200 (2.4%) were determined to have been negative RADT results with a positive throat culture. A cost analysis showed that elimination of confirmatory throat cultures for negative RADT results could produce substantial saving to a practice and to patients. The investigators concluded that culture confirmation of negative RADT results may not be necessary in all circumstances [36] .",

When selecting an antimicrobial for the treatment of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, it is important to consider efficacy, safety, antimicrobial spectrum (narrow versus broad), dosing schedules, compliance, and cost. Based on such considerations, several advisory bodies recommend penicillin as the treatment of choice for this infection [9] [10] [11] . Although the problem of increasing antimicrobial resistance among bacteria is one of the most important current infectious disease issues, GAS has never developed resistance to any of the penicillins or cephalosporins or shown any increase in penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations over at least 5 decades [41] . Amoxicillin often is used in place of oral penicillin V in young children; the efficacy appears equal. This choice is related primarily to acceptance of the taste of amoxicillin suspension. Orally administered erythromycin is indicated for patients allergic to penicillin. Other macrolides, such as clarithromycin or azithromycin, also are effective. First-generation cephalosporins also are acceptable in penicillin-allergic patients who do not manifest immediate-type hypersensitivity to b-lactam antibiotics.",

There has never been a clinical isolate of GAS documented to be resistant to penicillin anywhere in the world. Although there have been geographic areas with relatively high levels of resistance to macrolide antibiotics [49, 50] , the rate gerber of macrolide resistance among isolates of GAS in the United States generally has remained low at less than 5%. In an investigation of antibiotic resistance patterns of 245 pharyngeal isolates and 56 invasive isolates of GAS obtained between 1994 and 1997 from 24 states and the District of Columbia, only 8 (2.6%) of the 301 isolates were determined to be macrolide resistant [41] . Higher resistance rates occasionally have been reported, however. Nine percent of pharyngeal and 32% of invasive GAS strains collected in San Francisco during 1994-1995 were reported to be macrolide resistant [51] . Martin et al [52] , during a longitudinal investigation of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal disease in a single elementary school in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, found that 48% of the isolates of GAS collected between October 2000 and May 2001 were resistant to erythromycin. None were resistant to clindamycin. Molecular typing indicated that this outbreak was due to a single strain of GAS. In addition, of 100 randomly selected isolates of GAS obtained from the community between April and June 2001, 38 (38%) were resistant to erythromycin [52] .",
