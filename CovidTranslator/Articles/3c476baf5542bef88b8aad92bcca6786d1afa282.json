Quality Control and Trimming 54 The Quality Control (QC) and Trimming block starts with a process to verify the integrity of the 55 input data. If the sequencing files are corrupted, the execution of the analysis of that sample is 56 terminated. 57 The sequences are then processed by FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/ 58 projects/fastqc/, version 0.11.7) to determine the quality of the individual base pairs of the 59 raw data files. The low quality bases and adapter sequences are trimmed by Trimmomatic [10] 60 (version 0.36). By default, Trimmomatic removes the Illumina Nextera, TruSeq2 and TruSeq3 adapter 61 sequences that are detected, and relies on Phred scores [11] and FastQC analysis data to determine 62 to which extend the 5' and 3' ends of the reads need to be trimmed. The crop and headcrop setting 63 is calculated per sample, based on the GC ratio of each half of the read. By default, the window size 64 is set to 5 nucleotides with a minimum average quality of 20. In addition, paired-end reads with a 65 read length shorter than 55 nucleotides after trimming are removed from further analyses. 66 Lastly, the low complexity sequences, containing over 50% of poly-A, poly-N or poly-T nucleotides, 67 are filtered out of the raw data using PrinSeq [12] (version 0.10.4).",

To obtain a 77 high confidence assembly, the processed reads are first de novo assembled with SPAdes [15] (version 78 3.12.0). If the full CDS fails to be assembled into a single contig, the data is re-assembled with 79 MEGAHIT assembler [16] (version 1.1.3), a more permissive assembler developed to retrieve longer 80 sequences from metagenomics data. The resulting assemblies are corrected with Pilon [17] (version 81 1.22) after mapping the processed reads to the assemblies with Bowtie2 [13]. 82 If more than one complete CDS is present in a sample, each of the sequences will follow the rest 83 of the DEN-IM workflow independently. If no full CDS is assembled neither with SPAdes nor with 84 MEGAHIT, the processed reads are passed on to the next step for consensus generation by mapping, 85 effectively constituting DEN-IM's two pronged approach using both assemblers and mapping.",

With the resulting alignment, a Maximum Likelihood tree is inferred with RaXML [21] 104 (version 8.2.11), using as default the GTR-\u0393 substitution model and a 500 times bootstrap. 105 Optionally, the closest reference sequence in the DENV typing database to each analysed sample 106 can be retrieved and included in the phylogenetic analysis. 107 4 Workflow Execution 108 The DEN-IM workflow can be executed in any UNIX-based system, from local machines to high-109 performance computing clusters (HPC) facilities with Nextflow and a container engine installation, 110 such as Docker (https://www.docker.com/, Shifter [22] or Singularity [23]. 111 Due to its Nextflow implementation, DEN-IM allows for out-of-the-box high-level parallelization 112 and offers direct support for distributed computational environments. DEN-IM integrates Docker 113 containerised images for all the tools necessary for its execution, ensuring reproducibility and the 114 tracking of both software code and version, regardless of the operating system used. The Docker 115 images provided are also compatible with other container engines. 116 Users can customise the workflow execution either by using command line options or by modifying 117 a simple plain-text configuration file (params.config). The version of each of the tools used in 118 DEN-IM can be changed by providing new container tags in the appropriate configuration file 119 (containers.config). The resources for each process can also be changed (resources.config). To make 120 the execution of the workflow as simple as possible, a set of default parameters and directives is 121 provided. 122 The local installation of the DEN-IM workflow, including the docker containers with all the tools 123 needed and the curated DENV database, requires 15 Gigabytes of free disk space. The minimum 124 requirements to execute the workflow are at least 5 Gigabytes of memory and 4 CPUs, although 7 125 Gigabytes of memory is advised. The disk space required for execution depends greatly on the size 126 of the input data, but for the datasets used in this article DEN-IM generates approximately 20 Gb 127 data per Gb of input data. 128 5 Output and Report 129 The output files of all tools are stored in the 'results' folder in the directory of the DEN-IM execution.",

Besides the negative control, 3 samples did not 217 return typing information due to failing quality checks. In one case (92-1001), no DENV reads after 218 quality control processing were detected as all the reads contained highly repetitive sequences (AAA; 219 TTTT) and were filtered out.

Sequence data of sample CC0186 contained only 960 DENV 222 reads (0.03%), but these were successfully assembled into a CDS with an estimated depth of coverage 223 of 14.71x. 224 The proportion of DENV reads was the metagenomic samples is very variable. This may reflect 225 the viral load in patients in which DENV was detected by PCR. In the spiked sample, containing 226 4 distinct DENV serotypes, all four were correctly detected despite not being present in equal 227 concentrations(see Methods, Targeted Metagenomics Sequencing Data). This resulted in different 228 coverage of each serotype CDS (2032.31 times coverage for DENV-2, 229.02 times coverage for 229 DENV-1, 76.47 times coverage for DENV-3 and 29.78 times coverage for DENV-4), in accordance 230 with the ranking order of RT-PCR results. It highlights the potential of the DEN-IM workflow to 231 accurately detect and recover multiple DENV genomes from samples with DENV co-infection, even 232 if the serotypes are present in low abundance. Indeed, recent studies from areas of high endemicity 233 suggest that co-infection with multiple DENV serotypes may frequently occur [26] [27] and the 234 co-circulation of different DENV strains of the same serotype, but distinct genotypes, in these 235 areas [26] raises the possibility of simultaneous infection with more than one genotype.236When analysing the targeted metagenomics dataset, only 43 CDS out of 106 samples were de 237 novo assembled.

If the option to retrieve the closest typing reference is selected, these sequences are also included in the tree with respective typing metadata. The tree can be displayed in several conformationsprovided by Phylocanvas JavaScript branches. The support bootstrap values of the branches can be displayed and the tree can be exported To evaluate the DEN-IM workflow performance, we analysed two datasets, one containing shotgun metagenomics sequencing data of patient samples and another with targeted metagenomics sequencingThe workflow was executed using the default parameters and directives for resources, with the option to include the closest typing references in the final tree.The negative control and the 92-1001 sample has no reads after trimming and filtering of low complexity reads, therefore they were removed from further analysis.When mapping to the DENV mapping database, the percentage of DENV reads in the 21 clinical",
