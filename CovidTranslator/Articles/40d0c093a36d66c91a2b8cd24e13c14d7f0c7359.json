Material & methods: 33 patient samples from two collections sites in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which were pre-characterized via real-time RT-PCR targeting MERS-CoV orf1a and upE, and were tested using the MERS-CoV N gene, as a confirmatory assay. This diagnostic procedure follows a two-step diagnostics scheme, recommended by the WHO. Results: 18/33 samples tested positive, 11/33 tested negative for MERS-CoV RNA and 2/33 showed uncertain results. Conclusion: The results suggest, that the RealStar R MERS-CoV (N gene) RT-PCR Kit 1.0 can be considered a suitable and reliable confirmatory assay in combination with the RealStar MERS-CoV RT-PCR Kit 1.0 according to the diagnostic scheme recommended by WHO.",

Not until many other diagnostic tests came up negative and the pneumonia progressed, the patient was tested for MERS-CoV and came up positive.

For samples with discrepant results for upE and orf1a/orf1b, WHO recommends sequencing of a third target, either the RNA dependent RNA polymerase RdRp or the N gene. A modified version of this two-step diagnostic scheme is shown in Figure 1 . Routine diagnostic laboratories might not be able to perform a sufficient sequencing analysis and therefore rather perform a third RT-PCR targeting either rdrp or N gene.",

From the very first (known) cases international expert teams worked together in order to investigate this emerging disease in more detail and to develop reliable diagnostic tools and protocols that can be used to contain the spread of the virus. Sequencing data were generated and released that enabled the development of specific molecular diagnostic assays to detect MERS-CoV and to distinguish it from other related human coronaviruses, like the SARS virus [2] . Up until today, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for MERS available; thus, early case recognition and isolation of infected persons is the only strategy to curb the spread of the virus. Since the virus is detectable shortly after the onset of symptoms and as other diagnostics, such as cell culture are slow and practicable only in specialized laboratories, the specific detection of MERS-CoV RNA via RT-PCR is the method of choice and recommended by WHO [6, 16, 17] .",

According to this recommendations, a suspected MERS-CoV sample is considered positive when it is confirmed with two independent RT-PCR tests targeting different genomic regions [18] . A case with a positive PCR result for a single specific target without further testing but history of potential exposure is considered a probable case. The suggested course of action would be to either perform another PCR or sequencing of a third genomic region (Figure 1 ) [17, 18] , ideally with freshly extracted RNA from properly stored specimen [16] . False-negative results may occur due to poor quality of the specimen, collection of specimen late or very early in disease, inappropriate handling or shipment of specimen or due to technical reasons inherent to the performed test, such as virus mutation or PCR inhibition [19] . Proper specimen collection, transport conditions, extraction method and storages of eluates have a major impact on the quality of the RNA and therefore on reliable molecular diagnostic [16, 20] .",
