In this report, we introduced the VHP (Virus Host Prediction) to predict the potential hosts of viruses using deep learning algorithm. Our prediction suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Based on our prediction, compared to the Coronaviruses infecting other vertebrates, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoVs. Furthermore, by comparing the infectivity patterns of all viruses hosted on vertebrates, we found mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov. These consequences of infectivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCov.These results warn us to beware of 2019-nCoV and guide us to further explore the properties and reservoir of it. One Sentence Summary: It is of great value to identify whether a newly discovered virus has the risk of infecting human. Guo et al. proposed a virus host prediction method based on deep learning to detect what kind of host a virus can infect with DNA sequence as input.",

Moreover, when the potential hosts of novel viruses were predicted from a phylogenetic perspective, people usually accepted the assumption that the viruses with closer phylogenetic relationships have common hosts, pathogenicity and infection behavior. However, this assumption has proved unsustainable, because the abilities of infecting human are varied even within genus and most viruses are harmless to human.

The first case of unknown cause of pneumonia was found on 12 December 2019, and was later determined as a non-SARS novel coronavirus by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). This virus has now caused a total of 217 confirmed human infections in China and three deaths, reported by Chinese media on 20 January 2020. Yet the virus has trend to spread out of China, since one case in Thailand, one case in Japan and two cases in Korea had been sequentially reported since 15 January 2020 (1). Most of the patients are reported to have some link to seafood and animal market, which indicates the virus may spread from animals (2). And the possibility of human-to-human transmission of the virus is still under investigation. The situation is severe and it is urgent for us to have a better understanding towards this virus for further prevention and control. Meanwhile, the outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV warns us the importance of predicting the risk of novel virus infection of human. At present, six full genomes of 2019-nCoV have been submitted on GISAID (3) by China CDC, etc., and among them one has been released on GenBank (4) (Accession: MN908947).",

To this end, wereport the prediction results of the host of 2019-nCoV using the method, VHP (Virus Host Prediction), developed based on deep learning algorithm. The viral sequences data released before 2018 were used to build the training set, while those released after 2018 were utilized for testing.

In regard to protein level, we predicted the genes of 2019-nCoVs and annotated them and we found that the annotation results of all the six 2019-nCoV genomes are identical, including seven functional proteins (pp1a, E2 glycoprotein precursor, hypothetical protein sars3a, matrix protein, hypothetical protein sars6, hypothetical protein sars7a, nucleocapsid protein) verified in SARS-CoV-like coronavirus (15).

By core gene and accessary gene analysis of the left four 2019-nCoVs and the two Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses, we found three core genes: two ORFs and one functional gene ymdB.

In November 2002, SARS-CoV found its first victim in Foshan, mainland China, and soon spread to all over the country by travelling with potential patients (9). Different from other human-derived coronaviruses, SARS-CoV leads to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), with a fatality rate of up to ~10%. By July 2003, SARS-CoV had caused 8069 cases in 27 countries, 774 of them died (16). Another distinctive coronavirus, known as MERS-CoV, was isolated from a man died of severe pneumonia and organ failure in Saudi Arabia at June 2012 (10). MERS-CoV has infected 2,494 individuals in 27 countries since 2012, 858 of them died (17). A much higher fatality rate (~35%) has been shown in Middle East respiratory syndrome. Large epidemics of SARS and MERS have finished already, but follow-up studies never stop. High lethality and high human-to-human infectivity shown in these two diseases have raised alarm all over the world. Therefore, it's urgent for us to seek out a new way and establish defensive lines for public health. To sum up, in this report we predicted the potential of infecting human of 2019-nCoV, with implication of the risk of the 2019-nCoV. Aiming to give reliable predicted hosts and potential of infecting human of novel virus, VHP could play an important role in public health service and provide strong assistance for take precautions of novel viruses which have potential to infect human. At the end of this report, we provide a brief description of VHP method and the verification of the algorithm. To construct the VHP model, we utilized a Bi-path Convolutional Neural Networks (BiPathCNN) (18), where each viral sequence was represented by one-hot matrix of its base and codon separately. Considering difference in input sequence lengths, two BiPathCNNs (BiPathCNN-A and BiPathCNN-B) were built for predicting hosts of viral sequences from 100 bp to 400 bp and 400 bp to 800 bp respectively.

Compared to the Coronaviruses infecting other vertebrates, Coronaviruses in bat are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoVs by VHP, which illustrates that bat is more likely to be the reservoir of 2019-nCoVs than other known vertebrate hosts of Coronaviruses. To explore other potential reservoirs, we scored all the available vertebrate viruses in GenBank, filtered viruses that have similar infectivity pattern with 2019-nCoV (Table S4). Results show that detailed hosts information of the filtered viruses include Canine, Porcine, Mink, Tortoise and Feline. By comparing the infectivity patterns of all viruses hosted on these vertebrates, we found Mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov and thus we inferred Mink may be another candidate infection source of 2019-nCov.",

Furthermore, VHP provides five p-values, statistical measures of how distinct the infections are compared with non-infection events. In order to evaluate the performance of VHP, we compare AUC (Area Under Curve) of both blast and VHP. The comparison result shows that VHP performs with higher AUC in average (shown inTable 3).Acknowledgments: We acknowledge China CDC; Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union",
