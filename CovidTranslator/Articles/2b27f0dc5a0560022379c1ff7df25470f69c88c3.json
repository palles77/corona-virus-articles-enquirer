So-called \"primary palliative care\" is the responsibility of every provider caring 52 for a seriously ill patient.(8) This responsibility is only heightened in the context of an 53 epidemic. To help facilitate primary palliative care, palliative care consult teams can 54 help create guidelines or order sets for the management of typical COVID-19 55 symptoms. Whenever possible, these guidelines should be developed with the 56 cooperation of other services affected by this crisis (e.g. critical care, emergency 57 medicine, and hospital medicine). 58 Palliative care consult teams should make themselves available by phone for coaching 59 primary teams through the issues relating to seriously ill COVID-19 patients. They 60 should prepare to provide 'crash courses' in palliative medicine to providers on the front 61 line. Teams should consider having talking points at the ready for needs that are likely 62 to arise in the care of COVID-19 patients; such as: management of cough, secretions, 63 and shortness of breath; communication of triaging decisions; and management of 64 family grief. If primary teams become overwhelmed with patients, palliative care 65 consult services with the capacity can offset the responsibility of keeping patients' 66 families informed. It is especially important to ensure families are informed when 67 patients take a turn for the worse and/or die; in Italy there have been instances where 68 families were not informed of their loved ones' passing for days.(9) To facilitate the 69 sharing of communication responsibilities, we recommend scheduled daily 'card flips' 70 with the directors of COVID19 units in the hospital or the ICU.",

The lack of a clear national 122 consensus as to the criteria used to ration life-sustaining treatment will make decisions 123 appear arbitrary, further compounding the challenge. Palliative care providers may be 124 asked to be the 'bearers of bad news' in this context and will be tasked to help patients 125 and families cope with repercussions. Those palliative care providers who are 126 perceived by the patient and family as part of the 'death panel' who decided to not offer 127 life support will have a very difficult time establishing the trust that is necessary to 128 comfort patients and families and help them move forward. For this reason, we strongly 129 recommend that palliative care teams not participate in the crafting of guidelines to 130 ration care or in clinical decision-making about the value of life-sustaining therapies for 131 individual patients. More than ever, our patients and families need to view us as 132 neutral.

Providers should avoid terms 145 like 'futility' which can promote an adversarial relationship with the family.
