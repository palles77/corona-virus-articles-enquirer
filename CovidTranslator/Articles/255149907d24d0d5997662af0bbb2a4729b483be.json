PCR products were detected by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The P-10, P-15 and P-24 regions of the gag gene of FIV were chosen as the target sequences for amplification, and three primer pairs were prepared, The PCR products subjected to amplification with each primer pair were found to possess sites of digestion by a restriction enzyme, as hypothesized. They did not react with feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-infected or feline syncytium-forming virus ( FeSFV )-infected cell-derived DNA, and specifically amplified FIV-infected cell-derived DNA. FIV proviral DNA was detected by the PCR method with either primer pair (one-step amplification: single PCR) in DNA derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 7 of 12 FIV antibodypositive cats. When PCR products in each of the 12 cats were subjected to a second amplification using the same primer pair (two-step amplification: double PCR), FIV proviral DNA was detected in all of the cats. When PBL samples collected from three cats that were negative and three that were positive in the single PCR were cultured for a few weeks in the presence ofinterleukin 2, FIV proviral DNA was detected in all six cats by the single PCR method.",

FIV is a typical lentivirus morphologically resembling human and simian immunodeficiency viruses and showing similar pro-tein structure, and the presence of reverse transcriptase. The nucleotide sequence of FIV has been determined, and some reports have shown a relationship between the genomic organization and that of other lentiviruses (Olmsted et al., 1989a,b; Talbott et al., 1989) . When host cells are infected with FIV, viral RNA undergoes reverse transcription to DNA, which is mediated by reverse transcriptase, and is integrated into host cell DNA as a provirus, as with other lentiviruses. In this pattern of infection, FIV persists in the host cell DNA as a provirus.",

In the case of kittens born of antibody-positive cats, however, diagnosis by serological techniques is difficult, and for diagnosis it is necessary to demonstrate the FIV antigen. A person with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is positive for virus antigen, but some studies have shown the absence of conversion of the antibody in some cases (Imagawa et al., 1989; Pezzella et al., 1989) . In the case of FIV infection as well, the virus is isolated from antibody-negative cats (Hopper et al., 1988 ) . The FIV antigen has been demonstrated by isolation of viruses from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) (Yamamoto et al., 1988 ) , but it will take a long time for this procedure to be evaluated.

A DNA sample ( 1 #g in 30/A) was added to 5 ~1 of reaction mixture ( 10/tg of BSA), 5/tl of 10 mM deoxynucleotide mix (ATP, CTP, GTP and TTP), 5 #1 of 1 /IM primer mix, 1 /A of Taq polymerase (2 units//A; New England Biolaboratories, USA) and 4/A of distilled water (DH20), and mixed. DNA was amplified with a DNA Thermal Cycler (Atto Corp., Japan) after one drop of mineral oil was added to the mixture. The amplification involved incubation for 5 rain at 94\u00b0C as the first denaturation, subsequent cycling which consisted of denaturation for 1 min at 94\u00b0C, primer annealing for 2 min at 55\u00b0C and synthesis for 2 min at 72\u00b0C, repeated 35 times, and a last incubation for 5 min at 72 \u00b0C (one-step amplification: single PCR). Samples ( 10 #1) of the PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel. Bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and photographed under a UV transilluminator at 312 nm. The double PCR (2step amplification) involved a second amplification by the above-described methods with the same primers in 5/zl of PCR products.",

            "text": "PBL from three cats (KF 118, 159, 177) that were positive and from three cats (Kf 289, 300, 304) that were negative in the single PCR in the previous experiment were cultured in the presence of IL-2, and the cells were subjected to PCR after 2-3 weeks of culture. PBL from the three cats (KF 289, 300, 304) as well as the cats that were positive in the single PCR became positive in the single PCR (Table 3 ) . When these products were subjected to the double PCR, all of them were positive for FIV proviral DNA except for the PCR at primer P-10 in cat KF 118 (Table 3) . DISCUSSION FIV was isolated by in-vitro culture of PBL with susceptible cells, but it has taken a long time for evaluation of the procedure. Detection of antigen by ELISA using monoclonal antibody is a simpler method. When the blood levels of FIV antigen are considered, however, problems are predicted to arise regarding the sensitivity and specificity of detection. There are some reports of detection of provirus DNA by the PCR method in HIV infection, and its usefulness (Ou et al., 1988; Albert and Feny6, 1990) . Pedersen et al. (1990) reported cases in which PCR was used for FIV infection. They used two primer pairs in the gag region of FIV. Some strains of FIV, including the Petaluma strain, have been isolated (Pedersen et al., 1987; harbour et al., 1988; Miyazawa et al., 1989) . In the present study, the P-10, P-15 and P-24 regions of the gag gene, which are believed to be conserved relatively well among FIV strains, were amplified by the PCR method, and proviral DNA was detected. The PCR products amplified with each primer pair were found to possess the sites of cleavage by a restriction enzyme at the same position as those of the target sequences, showing that the target sequence for the FIV gene was precisely amplified (Figs. 2a, 2b and 2c) . It was further indicated that the PCR with each primer pair did not react with FeSFV-or FeLV-infected cells and that the PCR was specific to FIV (Fig. 1 ). The PCR system was applied to PBL from FIV antibody-positive cats. Proviral DNA was detected in the PBL from only 7 of 12 cats by the PCR whose single step consisted of 35 cycles (single PCR), an unsatisfactory result (Table 2 ). If the single PCR products from the cats in which proviral DNA was not detected are subjected to detection of DNA by Southern blot or dot-blot hybridization using radioisotopes, DNA detection will be more sensitive. Pedersen et al. (1990) also detected the PCR products by Southern blot hybridization using radiolabeled probes. However, these procedures are troublesome for routine PCR procedures. Albert and Feny~5 (1990) , and Garson et al. (1990) amplified human immunodeficiency viral sequences and hepatitis C viral sequences, respectively, by 2-step PCR, in which two primer pairs (an outer primer pair and an inner primer pair) were used. The PCR products yielded by the outer primer pair were subjected to another amplification with the inner primer pair, and DNA was detected in the products by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining (PCR with nested primers or \"nested\" PCR). The 2-step amplification may increase the sensitivity of detection, and the use of nested primers may increase its specificity. The authors also conducted a second amplification of PCR products from PBL from 12 cats using the same primer pair (double PCR). As a result, FIV proviral DNA was detected in the PBL from all 12 cats (Table 2) . We prepared the outer primer pair of the primer pair used in this study, and the system of \"nested\" PCR is now under investigation. The use of cultured PBL enabled detection of products even by single PCR (Table 3 ). This result may be due to the fact that the proportion of FIVinfected lymphocytes is increased by in vitro culture. It is not known at present what percentage of FIV proviral DNA is included in PBL. How the incidence of infection varies even among antibody-positive cats is also unknown. The use of the PCR technique should answer these questions. An inactivated FIV vaccine may be developed in the future. Then it will be increasingly necessary to distinguish the antibody induced by vaccination from that induced by infection. The detection of proviral DNA by PCR seems to be a useful method for diagnosis of FIV infection from the viewpoint of such a background factor. enstine, L., Munn, R., and Pedersen, N.C., 1988 .
