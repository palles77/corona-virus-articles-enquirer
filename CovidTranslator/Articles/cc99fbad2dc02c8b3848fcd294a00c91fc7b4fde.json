We assessed the emergency response of health care workers (HCWs) involved in case management. Method: This was a cross-sectional study with data collected through a selfadministered questionnaire. Data entry and analysis were performed using Epi info software. Results: A total of 56 HCWs were interviewed. The mean age was 31 years (SD \u00b1 8.16 years). The majority of the HCWs (80%; n = 45) were aged 18-39 years. Most were community health extension workers (60%), and 3.6% (n = 2) were medical doctors. Many of the HCWs had less than 2 years of work experience (42%). Additionally, 82% of the respondents had <1 week of cholera emergency response training, and 50% of the HCWs managed >20 suspected cases of cholera per day. Although 78% of HCWs reported the practice of universal safety precautions, 32% (n = 18) knew HCWs who developed symptoms of cholera during the epidemic, most of which was believed to be hospital acquired (78%). We also found that 77% (n = 43) of HCWs had no access to the required emergency response supplies. Conclusion: Inadequate training, a lack of qualified HCWs and a limited supply of emergency response kits were reported. Therefore, the government and stakeholders should address the gaps noted to adequately control and prevent future epidemics.",

In 1991, another massive wave occurred, affecting 59,478 people with a CFR of 12.9%, predominantly in northern Nigeria. A review of the cholera cases observed from 1991 to the present suggests that cholera has become endemic in Nigeria.
