We reviewed 17,858 surgically excised gastrointestinal lesions in our hospital from 1998 to 2004. All mesenchymal tumors were examined for CD117 expression by immunohistochemistry, and every CD117-negative mesenchymal tumors were further subjected to mutational analysis for KIT and PDGFRA exons. The results showed that approximately 35% of gastrointestinal stromal tumors were misdiagnosed if immunohistochemical analysis of CD117 expression was not performed; and approximately 15% misdiagnosed if mutation analysis was not available. Because approximately 4.72% of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies in Taiwan were treated in our hospital and the average of newly diagnosed gastrointestinal stromal tumors in our hospital was 14.33 cases per",

Afterwards, GIST was either used as an inclusive term to refer mesenchymal tumors regardless of their differentiation phenotype [1] or as an exclusive term for mesenchymal tumors that do not differentiate into Schwann cells or smooth-muscle cells [2] . The terminology was in flux and, for example, gastrointestinal autonomic nerve tumor, as known as plexosarcoma, was used when tumors of this kind show ultrastructural features of complex interdigitating cell processes, neurosecretory granules, and intermediate filaments. The estimated incidence of GIST, in the sense of such heterogeneous neoplasms, was approximately 6.8 per million [3] .",

Several investigators showed that 52-92% of GISTs harbored KIT mutation [11] [12] [13] and approximately 35% of GISTs lacking mutated KIT had PDGFRA mutation [14] . The discovery of mutations of these genes in GISTs is important from a therapeutic point of view because GISTs harboring such a mutation respond to imatinib mesylate (Glivec, Novartis Pharma, Basel, Switzerland) [15] . In addition to the therapeutic implication, mutation analysis can provide an additional diagnostic indicator for some GISTs that are immunonegative for CD117 [16, 17] . These CD117-negative GISTs are likely to be overlooked unless mutated KIT or PDGFRA genes are identified in the tumor. In this regard, the incidence of GIST, including the CD117-negative ones, remains to be estimated. These data are important to healthcare providers regarding the availability of imatinib mesylate, a remarkably effective [18] and expensive therapeutic agent for GISTs.",

Our estimated incidence is much higher than that of a recent study in the United States [3] , which was based on the data of the National Cancer Institutes Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results (SEER) registries. They reported an incidence rate of 6.8 per million and speculated that their incidence may be overestimated because of possible inclusion of non-GIST tumors in their calculation. Based on our finding that about 36% of GISTs would be misdiagnosed as other mesenchymal tumors if immunohistochemical and molecular analyses are not employed in the diagnosis, we believed the SEER's rate was in fact underestimated. However, it should be addressed that the SEER data did not include GISTs that were diagnosed as benign tumors; therefore, the SEER's rate probably reflected the incidence of GISTs with high or intermediate risk of malignancy.",

The incidence of GIST in Taiwan is slightly lower than that in Sweden, where the annual incidence of 14.5 per million was reported [9] . The true annual incidence of GISTs in Sweden would probably be higher if CD117-negative GISTs were included. The slight difference in the annual incidences between Taiwan and Sweden could be explained, at least in part, by the autopsy cases. None of the GISTs analyzed in this study were identified from the autopsy cases, whereas 10% of GISTs in Sweden's study were incidentally identified at the time of autopsy [9] . In addition, the difference could also be explained by racial variation in that the SEER study pointed out a significant difference in incidence between Asian Pacific Islanders (10.3 per million) and Whites (6.0 per million) [3] .
