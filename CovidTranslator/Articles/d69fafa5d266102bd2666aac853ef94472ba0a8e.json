As of February 20, 2020, more than 75,748 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 28 countries (including China) and international conveyance (cruise ship in the Japanese territorial waters), with approximately 99% of cases occurring in mainland China. 3 The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020 in response to the rapid growth of the outbreak and reports of human-to-human transmission in several countries. 3 Here, we summarise how key events unfolded, review the current understanding of COVID-19, contrast the outbreak of COVID-19 with the experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and discuss how anaesthetists should prepare themselves in view of this outbreak.",

            "text": "The evolving story of the COVID-19 outbreak has advanced over a remarkably short time frame (Fig 1) . On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported a cluster of pneumonia of unknown origin, all linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. This market harboured a variety of live and deceased exotic wildlife, including live bamboo rats, palm civets, badgers, and wolf cubs. It is notable that a quarter of the initially reported 27 pneumonia cases presented with severe disease. 45 Within days, the cause of the pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 2 On January 19, 2020 the WHO issued a warning that the virus may have the ability to spread from human to human. 3 Wuhan is a major transportation hub within China with a population of 11 million. On a typical day, approximately 3500 people take flights to other countries from Wuhan, and the number increases with holidays and the Chinese Lunar New Year. Within 1 month, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases rose to more than 9000, surpassing the number of SARS and MERS cases reported to date. Similarly, global fears escalated as cases spread to other countries. Extensive control measures were put into place, starting with massive decontamination efforts and, ultimately, closure of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, banning the trade of wildlife and poultry in wet markets, contact tracing of cases, exit screening at airports, lockdown and quarantine measures that progressed to include adjacent cities (an estimated 50e60 million people affected), school closures, extension of the Lunar New Year holiday, prohibition of mass gatherings, and building of two new hospitals (1000 and 1600 beds) to care for infected individuals. Other nations instituted airport screening, travel bans, and evacuating citizens from Hubei Province and quarantining them through the incubation period. 6 Despite these measures, the case counts continued to increase in the outbreak epicenter, and countries with imported cases reported clusters of human-to-human transmission. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared a PHEIC, calling for intensified international collaborative efforts to halt the outbreak. 3 Although Chinese authorities have heavily restricted movement from Wuhan, this austere measure came at the same time as the Spring Festival, a time when the number of outbound travellers from Wuhan is estimated to be more than 15 million.",

            "text": "The 2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the Coronaviridae, a family of viruses that can infect humans and several animal species. To date, seven human coronaviruses have been identified (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2). 7 The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus and most closely resembles a bat coronavirus, with which it shares 96.2% genetic sequence homology. 2 8 9 The current belief is that COVID-19 was introduced into humans through an as yet unidentified intermediary animal, and it has since propagated through human-to-human spread. Human-to-human transmission occurs primarily through respiratory droplets that travel up to 2 m and may enter the respiratory tract of individuals within range or contaminated surfaces, leading to infection through contact transmission. 10 The average incubation period is 5 days, but it ranges from 1 to 14 days. 10 11 The basic reproductive number (the number of cases one infected individual generates), R 0 , is estimated to be 2.68 (95% confidence interval: 2.47e2.86). 12 Whilst asymptomatic transmission (during the incubation period, before onset of symptoms in infected individuals) has been suggested, it remains controversial and currently does not appear to be a major factor for infection transmission. 10 Infections in humans result in a spectrum of clinical disease, from mild upper respiratory tract infection, mostly commonly characterised by fever (82%) and cough (81%), to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis. The median age of infected individuals is between 49 and 56 yr. 1 13 Children are rarely diagnosed with 2019-nCoV, a phenomenon that has not yet been explained. Characterisation of the first 99 cases of 2019-nCoV within Wuhan demonstrated that 33% had severe illness, with 17% developing ARDS, 4% requiring mechanical ventilation, and 4% having sepsis. 13 The case fatality rate is currently estimated at 2% based on the confirmed cases reported for the ongoing outbreak. 3 However, as mild and subclinical infections are currently under-reported, the true case fatality is likely lower than this. 14 People with co-morbidities, such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, appear to be at higher risk for death. 1 13 ",

Early identification of the full genome also aids in vaccine development.

            "text": "During the SARS outbreak, 21% of the infected individuals globally were healthcare workers. 15 In Canada, a final count of 251 cases of SARS was confirmed; 43% of them were healthcare workers, the majority were from Toronto. 15 Concerns were raised about infections in healthcare workers despite apparently appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Analysis of this experience uncovered several important lessons. 19 First, the protection of healthcare workers is not just about PPE; it encompasses all principles of infection prevention and control. 20 Whilst the initial focus for protecting anaesthesiologists or personnel involved in aerosol-generating medical procedures (tracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation, tracheotomy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, manual ventilation before intubation, and bronchoscopy) was on the need for more stringent PPE, such as powered air-purifying respirators or double gloves during the SARS outbreak, further investigation did not support a risk of transmission with tracheal intubation if appropriate precautions and more standard PPE were used. 21 22 In areas, such as the emergency department or ICU where SARS patients were managed, there were 'uncontrolled situations characterized by multiple opportunities for extensive contamination and staff exposure prior to the intubation event'. 21 Healthcare workers were exposed to risk of infection before PPE was used. It reflects the importance of triage, early recognition, and prompt isolation for suspected cases of infected patients. 20 Second, a post-SARS investigation interviewing healthcare workers involved in the intubation of SARS patients in Toronto highlighted non-compliance or sub-optimal adherence to the use of PPE. 23 Although much is unknown about the 2019-nCoV, it is believed to spread from person to person amongst close contact via respiratory droplets and contact transmission. Strict adherence to the use of PPE, including procedure mask, eye protection, gown, and gloves, is highly effective in limiting droplet and contact transmission. 21 The current WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance for the protection of personnel during aerosol-generating medical procedures in patients with confirmed/suspected 2019-nCoV centres around principles of clear communication, minimising personnel in the room during the procedure, appropriate use of PPE, and avoidance of procedures that generate high amounts of aerosols. Some considerations are provided as follows to help prepare for airway management of confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients. 20 24 25 These suggestions are by no means comprehensive. Hospitals should develop local plans for aerosolgenerating medical procedures in suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients using a collaborative approach that engages anaesthesiologists, intensivists, emergency medicine physicians, respiratory therapists, resuscitation team members, infection prevention and control, occupational health and safety specialists, and environmental services staff.",

(iii) A thorough preoxygenation with 100% oxygen and rapid sequence induction (RSI) should be considered to avoid manual ventilation of the patient, which can result in aerosolisation of virus from airways. (iv) RSI may need to be modified if the patient has a very high alveolarearterial oxygen gradient, is unable to tolerate 30 s of apnoea, or has a contraindication to succinylcholine. If manual ventilation is anticipated, small tidal volumes should be applied. (v) Awake fibreoptic intubation should be avoided unless specifically indicated, as the atomised local anaesthetic and the coughing episode during anaesthetising of the airway can aerosolise the virus. Consider the use of a videolaryngoscopy. (vi) Tracheal intubation rather than the use of laryngeal mask is favoured. (vii) In managing patients with respiratory distress from coronavirus infection outside the operating theatre, noninvasive ventilation should be avoided, if possible, to prevent generation of aerosol of virus in the room, and early intubation should be considered in a rapidly deteriorating patient. Whilst resuscitating the critically ill patient, chest compressions should be held during intubation to avoid exposing the face of the intubating clinician to aerosols, and neuromuscular blockers should be considered before intubation, if possible.",
