Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and infections are the main factors limiting long-term survival in lung transplant recipients (LTRs) [1] . Acute cellular rejection (ACR) is a potential risk factor for the development of CLAD [2] [3] [4] [5] . During the first postoperative year, ACR affects 28% of LTRs at least once, necessitating treatment with steroid augmentation [1, 6] . Symptoms of ACR are nonspecific, including dyspnea, cough, sputum production, fever and/or hypoxia [7, 8] . Non-invasive tests like pulmonary function testing and chest imaging are useful indicators for potential complications, but have no discriminatory value between ACR and infection [9] . For these reasons, transbronchial biopsies (TBB) remain the gold standard for the diagnosis of ACR [10] . However, TBB are invasive and bear potential risks such as pneumothorax or bleeding [11, 12] . Moreover, TBB are prone to sampling error and inter-observer variability [13] [14] [15] . The clinical and prognostic role of grade A1 ACR remains unclear. Depending on clinical management guidelines and practice standards at different transplant centers, a finding of grade A1 ACR might be ignored, prompt repeat biopsy or might result in augmented immunosuppression [11, 16, 17] .",

The immunoassays use microplates precoated with polyclonal antibodies specific for the cytokine and enzyme-linked polyclonal antibodies for their detection in a blinded fashion (R& D Systems; Minneapolis, MN, USA). ELISA kits included Quantikine\u00ae ELISA Human IL-6 Immunoassay (catalog # D6050), Quantikine\u00ae ELISA Human CXCL8/IL-8 Immunoassay (catalog # D8000C), Quantikine\u00ae ELISA Human IFN-\u03b3 Immunoassay (catalog # DIF50) and Quantikine\u00ae HS ELISA Human TNF-\u03b1 Immunoassay (catalog # HSTA00D). All cytokines were measured according to the manufacturer's instruction. The absorbance was measured in an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader (Dynex Opsys MR\u2122 Microplate Reader) at 450/630 nm. The respective cytokine concentration was determined by interpolation from standard curves and expressed as pg/ml. Sensitivity of the assays was 0.7 pg/ml for IL-6, 3.5 pg/ml for IL-8, 8 pg/ml for IFN-\u03b3 and 0.1 pg/ml for TNF-\u03b1. BAL fluid cytokine concentrations were measured once a week. BAL fluid cytokine samples were stored at 4\u00b0C until processed, for a maximum of one week. Starting in 2013, samples were centrifuged for 10 min at a speed of 2370 g at 4\u00b0C immediately prior to the measurements. The supernatant was removed from the pellet after centrifugation. In summary, 50 \u03bcl/well (TNF-\u03b1) or 100 \u03bcl/well (IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-8) of Assay Diluent were added to the well of the cytokine microplates, then 50 \u03bcl/ well (IL-8), 100 \u03bcl/well (IFN-\u03b3, IL-6) or 200 \u03bcl/well (TNF-\u03b1) of the respective BAL sample, standards and controls were added as suggested by the manufacturer and incubated for 2 h (IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-8) or 3 h (TNF-\u03b1). Plates were washed four times (IL-6), five times (IFN-\u03b3, IL-8) or six times (TNF-\u03b1). Removing excess liquid and washing thoroughly is essential; hence, plates with IFN-\u03b3 and IL-8 were washed once more than suggested by the provider. Then, 100 \u03bcl/well (IL-8) or 200 \u03bcl/well (IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) of the respective Conjugate was added and incubated at room temperature for one hour (IL-8) or two hours (IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1). Plates were washed four times (IL-6), five times (IFN-\u03b3, IL-8) or six times (TNF-\u03b1). Only in the case of TNF-\u03b1 50 \u03bcl/well of Amplifying Solution had to be added before the addition of the Substrate Solution and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Then, 50 \u03bcl/well (TNF-\u03b1) or 200 \u03bcl/well (IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-8) of the respective Substrate Solutions were added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min (IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-8) or 60 min (TNF-\u03b1). 50 \u03bcl/well of Stop Solution was added (IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1).

Whereas some experimental and clinical data showed a significant increase in IL-6 in ACR [22, 38] , other studies found no significant association at all [39, 40] . Despite the high number of samples no correlation was found in our analyses. IL-8 was significantly lower during infection than in LTRs with \"no pathologic process\" after adjustment for age, underlying disease and type of infection. No correlation was found between IL-8 and ACR, which is along the line with most previous studies [22, 41, 42] . While IL-8 has been linked with the development of CLAD, its role in detecting ACR seems negligible according to our data [43, 44] . Levels of IFN-\u03b3 were significantly lower during ACR only after correction for age, underlying disease and type of infection. However, in the light of the results from previous studies, these findings should be interpreted with caution [39, [45] [46] [47] . Levels of TNF-\u03b1 did not correlate with the four prespecified groups. Accordingly, previous studies have suggested no correlation between TNF-\u03b1 and ACR [22, 39, 47] . Of technical note, ELISA is not the best method to detect TNF-\u03b1 since it is limited in the detection of cytokines that are active in the membrane bound form [48, 49] .",

            "text": "This study has several limitations: First, this is a retrospective study. Thus, even though we planned surveillance bronchoscopies at regular intervals, a selection bias can't be excluded and patients with clinically relevant allograft dysfunction or infection did not undergo surveillance bronchoscopies. This might explain why we derived data from 319 patients, missing the potential of 425 subjects. Also, while we obtained total cell count in BAL samples we did not include this information in our analysis. An increase in total cell count is non-specific after lung transplantation and has also been found in periods with no infection or rejection [50] . Second, we restricted cytokine analysis to a small number of cytokines. When this study was initiated in 1998, these were the only commercially available and validated kits used at our center. All four cytokines had been associated with rejection in previous studies [26] . Also, we did not perform immunologic analyses reflecting the innate immune system such as alpha defensins or matrix metalloproteinases. Further, combining BAL cytokine and cytology levels might contribute to a composite score, increasing diagnostic accuracy for BAL to diagnose ACR. However, evaluating such a score was not part of the study. Third, due to the fact, that AMR was an ill-defined condition before the publication of the 2016 ISHLT Consensus Report [51] we did not include patients with AMR in our study. Fourth, we did not perform analyses to associate cytokines with CLAD development [52, 53] . The diagnosis of CLAD is an indication to treat patients with an immunomodulatory macrolide. As such, even if the absolute number of patients receiving macrolides at our institution during the first year after lung transplantation is low, a bias of such treatment for cytokine distribution in BAL cannot be excluded [54] . Fifth, statistical methods were not used to adjust for storage time of the BAL samples, number of analyses per patient and date of collection after transplantation. Sixth, infection was defined based on microbiological findings in BAL fluid only and did not take into account clinical symptoms, imaging studies, macroscopic appearance of BAL fluid and concomitant antibiotic, antiviral or antifungal medication. Detecting infection and differentiating infection from ACR based on clinical symptoms may be difficult in LTRs [33, 55] . Thus, in patients on multiple immunosuppressive drugs the mere presence of pathogens in BAL fluid in the absence of clinical deterioration may fulfill criteria of infection and prompt anti-infective treatment. Indeed, at our center, all pathogenic findings in BAL fluid except for oral flora and candida species prompted anti-infective treatment [30, 31] .",

The ISHLT has recently established a Working Group to address this issue as far as the BAL procedure is concerned, the quotient of instilled volume and aspirated volume should be calculated and provided. This facilitates comparability of cellular and protein concentrations between studies. This would be particularly important for cytokines, as their concentrations are typically low. To further correct for dilution factors of BAL fluid, the urea method has been described, whereby the measured BAL fluid cytokine concentration is adjusted to a urea plasma/ BAL coefficient [56] . We did not apply this method in our study to normalize the data. Levy and colleagues recently showed that sequential BAL samples reflect distinct pulmonary compartments [57] . This might have implications for future research. Along this line, centers should agree on a standardized cytokine detection method as comparability between methods is low [48] . ELISA has been a reliable method at our center. However, it is costly and requires strict adherence to time protocols. FACS or Luminex\u00ae assays may be alternatives for selected cytokines, yet these methods have yielded less reliable results in our laboratory. Also, numerous potential confounders related to medication (dosage of immunosuppression, anti-infective prophylaxis and treatment, additional individual medication) and immunological analysis make interpretation of cytokine data in LTRs challenging. In the field of rheumatology attempts have been made to harmonize autoantibody nomenclature, thereby optimizing antinuclear antibody usage [58] .",
