US guidelines specifically recommend use of influenza and multiplex-PCR (mPCR) if these can change the management of hospitalized patients [2] . Patient benefit relies on rapid results turnaround time, and in this regard several kits are suitable for point of care (POC) use [3] [4] [5] . A few studies have investigated the impact of these tests on prescribing of antiinfectives and length of stay, and their potential cost-effectiveness [3, 5] . However, none has focused on the impact of mPCR on infection prevention measures such as droplets precautions and single room allocation of hospitalized patients. We conducted a prospective feasibility study of mPCR use as a POC test in the Emergency Department (ED) of our 850bed hospital (ED) during the 2018-2019 influenza epidemic season. We evaluated it's impact on single room assignment and antiviral use among severe patients seeking care in the ED.",

The median age of the 157 included patients was 72 years, with slightly more men (n=89, 56%). The positivity rate of mPCR was 50% (79/157) including 6 coinfections. Influenza A, rhinovirus and RSV were identified in 46 (58%), 12 (15%)and 12 (15%) of the 79 mPCR-positive samples, respectively (Table) . Among influenza-positive patients, fever, shortness of breath, cough and myalgia were present in 31 (67%), 40 (87%), 39 (85%) and 20 (43%), respectively. Fever was present in 17 (51%) of patients with viruses other than influenza, and in 26/78 (33%) patients who were mPCR-negative. No significant differences in symptoms were observed between groups. 37/49 (80%), 24/37 (65%) and 32/78 (41%) patients with influenza-positive, non-influenzapositive and negative mPCR were assigned a single room, respectively (Table) . The difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). Nearly all influenza-positive patients (45/46, 98%) received Oseltamivir, contrasting with 6/111 (5%) non-influenza patients (p<0.001). 20/46 (43%) influenza-positive patients and 39/111 (35%) non-influenza patients received empirical antibiotic treatment (p=0.46). Median length of stay of patients with a positive mPCR was three days, 34/79 (43%) were admitted to the ICU and 8 (5%) died during the hospital stay, without differences according to the pathogen.",

            "text": "In a large French ED using a POC mPCR testing strategy, patients with influenza received appropriate antiviral treatment in nearly all instances, and were assigned a single room in 80% of cases, as well as 75% of the two other most severe viruses, RSV and metapneumovirus. A previous retrospective study conducted in our ED showed that, with a median laboratory mPCR turnaround time of 19 hours, only 22% of patients with influenza were appropriately assigned to a single room. Not isolating influenza-positive patients a single room depends on multiple reasons, including the variable epidemic course and the local availability of those rooms. Until now, a few studies assessed the impact of a rapid turnaround time for multiplex testing. Most agreed on a global benefit despite their cost ranging from 80 to 140 euros per unit [3] [4] [5] 7] . A recent study in England showed a reduction of \u00a364 per stay, and another in China showed a reduction of $200 per stay [3, 5] . However, these two studies did not provide a clear description of any improvement in utilization of isolation facilities. Among the imitations, our study was single-center with a limited number of patients. Patients were followed until transfer to clinical wards and we could not evaluate the mPCR impact on antibiotic duration or its cost-effectiveness. However, the high mPCR positivity rate, and the low failure rate, point to correct use of the test by a relatively small number of trained ED physicians. High rates of assignment to single rooms for patients with potentially the most severe viruses, and appropriate use of antiviral treatment strongly suggest the benefits of POC mPCR testing. Additional studies are needed to confirm the clinical impact and costeffectiveness of this approach, as well as the benefits on isolation management of syndromic testing as a POC method in the ED setting.",
