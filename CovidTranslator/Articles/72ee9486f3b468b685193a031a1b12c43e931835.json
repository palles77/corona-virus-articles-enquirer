The disease, caused by a novel coronavirus, resulted from spread of the virus from civet cats to humans in the food markets of southern China; once individuals were hospitalized, the virus spread nosocomially to infect other patients and staff. The first reports of this novel disease outbreak came from the local media, and were later substantiated by e-mail messages. These caused international concern, in part because it was feared that a new influenza pandemic was emerging, and heightened as formal confirmation from Chinese authorities was not forthcoming. 1 Whilst the international community remained largely powerless, there being no legal mandate to ensure that China clarified what was occurring, cases appeared in other countries, further raising the stakes.",

First, with the advent of, and wide access to, the Internet and e-mail, information through informal and largely unverifiable sources can be transmitted to worldwide audiences within the public domain ahead of information sharing through formal channels. Second, because of the speed of movement of people, diseases can emerge in countries far from their source before outbreaks or the pathogens that cause them have been confirmed or identified.",

            "text": "SARS galvanized the international community to finally conclude drafting of the revised IHR. The IHR bind WHO member countries to not only notify all events that may constitute a public health emergency, but also to respond to requests for verification of information. WHO has also produced outbreak communication guidelines to aid in the dissemination of information to the public, recognizing that 'expertise [in communications] has become as essential to outbreak control as epidemiological training and laboratory analysis'. 2 The boundaries between risk communication and management are not, however, sharply delineated, as illustrated by the controversy surrounding H5N1 influenza virus sharing. Indonesia is one of the countries hardest hit by outbreaks of H5N1. Virus sharing with the international community is the mechanism by which, first, viruses developing pandemic potential can be tracked (risk communication), and second, vaccines can be developed to meet global need (risk management). Indonesia refused to virus share, not because it was opposed to the sharing of technical information to better understand the threat posed by H5N1 avian influenza, but because it felt excluded from equitable access to the resulting vaccine, meaning that its management of a subsequent pandemic would be constrained. 3 It could be argued that Indonesian authorities currently view virus sharing as an important element in risk management and thus a sovereign issue, although the international community, by contrast, views virus sharing as a critical element of risk communication and, by extension, a global risk management issue. Differing interpretations of international treaties are possible and resolution is proving challenging. 4 Ultimately, the debate is centred on the boundary between the governance of risk communication and risk management, the former now being mandated through international laws, with the latter remaining, to a large degree, a national sovereignty responsibility.",

            "text": "In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the Gulf coast of the USA. The worst consequences were felt in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the levee system was breached and billions of dollars of damage occurred. The storm also caused significant loss of life and many people were displaced from their homes. The magnitude of the hurricane was anticipated, the risk having been communicated at both local and national level. However, this risk warning was not heeded appropriately. For example, although mandatory evacuation was eventually ordered, there was little provision for the large numbers involved or for those citizens who could not evacuate themselves. The aftermath of the storm, with many people left living in squalid conditions, also revealed a risk management process that left much to be desired. 5 One notable example was in the coordination of a bi-partisan emergency federal health policy response, attempts at which were blocked by the White House, citing multiple concerns including relevance and cost. The subsequent delay resulted in profound health, economic and political consequences. 6 Several lessons may be drawn for the risk management of disease outbreaks. Firstly, although risk communication may occur, it does not automatically result in a co-ordinated risk management response. Second, this occurred in the USA, a country which clearly has the public health and disaster management resources to deal with such a problem. However, these resources were not mobilized effectively, efficiently or in a timely manner. At the heart of many of the problems were fractured communication systems. Among operational problems, there were failures in communication technologies subsequent to the weather conditions and, whilst some decisions required extensive information, others were made on the basis of unverified rumours reported by the media, leading to incoherent responses. 5 Communication failures occurred between the local, state and federal agencies, and there was a lack of clear roles and responsibilities. Although New Orleans had experienced previous hurricanes and had a disaster management plan, the plan was clearly operationally fragile.",
