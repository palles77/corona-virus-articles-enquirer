Intact and inactivated virions as well as the nucleocapsid fraction did not differ significantly in their IFN-inducing capacity. In contrast, genomic RNA as well as M protein fraction and envelopes induced IFN titres to a level of about 10% of those achieved with virions. NDV-induced IFN production could be blocked specifically by incubation with polyclonal anti-NDV-monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and with two of three anti-HN-mAbs, but not with anti-NDV-mAbs directed against the F, M or NP protein. In addition, IFN induction by fixed MDBK cells, expressing NDV surface proteins after infection with NDV Ulster, was inhibited by one of two anti-F-mAbs. The results suggest that the induction of IFN synthesis in human PBML is a complex process involving not only the HN protein but also the uncleaved F protein precursor, a component of the M protein fraction and -once having entered the cell -the genomic RNA.",

Extremely lentogenic strains, such as NDV Ulster, contain both glycoproteins in an uncleaved form (Millar et al., 1988 , Nagai et al., 1977 , Sato et al., 1987 . The third envelope protein, the matrix (M) protein, is located on the inner side of the lipid membrane, from where it mediates the binding of the nucleocapsid to those areas of the cell membrane which contain the viral surface glycoproteins. This role in assembly of the virus is the only function known for M protein so far, but as it can be detected in the nucleus of infected cells (Faaberg and Peeples, 1988; Peeples et al., 1992) , this protein is probably of further importance.",

This feature renders NDV a suitable model virus for studying the mechanism of IFN induction. Because of the importance of this cytokine group, especially in protecting from viral infections and tumor diseases, many attempts have been made to define the mechanism of IFN induction. However the intrinsic IFN inducer of NDV has not yet been identified. Studies published so far have been, for the most part, indirectly designed and have produced conflicting results. Meager and Burke (1972) , as well as Lomniczi (1973) , discuss the hypothesis that a subtle activity of the virion-associated RNA-Polymerase is responsible for IFN induction. Other authors assume that primary transcription followed by the formation of double-stranded (ds) RNA is necessary for IFN induction (Sheaff et al., 1972) or that the genomic RNA is the intrinsic inducer molecule , Lomniczi, 1973 .",

Polyclonal anti-NDV-antibodies and two of three anti-HN-mAbs blocked IFN production. As there are neutralizing mAbs without effect on IFN induction (L 15-8 and the anti-F-mAbs, (Weisong and Xiufan, 1991, Umino et al., 1990) ) and as NDV glycoproteins expressed on the surface of fixed cells in which the elution of infectious virus is excluded were capable of stimulating IFN production (see also Capobianchi et al., 1988 , Lebon, 1985 , Jestin and Cherbonnel, 1991 , Charley and Laude, 1988 , the induction process is not bound to the entry of the virus into the cell. The inhibitory activity of anti-F-mAb which recognizes both cleaved and uncleaved F protein (Xiulong and Xiufan, 1988 ) is restricted to virus containing an uncleaved F protein. This indicates that an epitope of the F protein precursor which is missing on the mature protein plays a role in IFN induction.",

Firstly, control sera or ascitic fluids showed no inhibiting activity. Secondly, anti-NDV-antibodies exerted no inhibitory effect on IFN stimulation mediated by a poxvirus (PPV ovis), whereas they do inhibit IFN production induced by a closely related orthomyxovirus (influenza virus). The latter result was to be expected, if inhibition is due to a specific antigen antibody reaction, as the anti-NDV-antibodies crossreact with influenza virus in an analytic (ELISA) as well as in a functional (HI) assay. We cannot explain, why anti-influenza virus antibodies do not influence IFN induction by NDV. Perhaps the latter recognize epitopes necessary for hemagglutination, but not involved in IFN induction.",
