Understanding the molecular mechanisms of SARS-induced cytopathic effects (CPEs) is a rational approach for the prevention of SARS, and an understanding of the cellular stress responses induced by viral infection is important for understanding the CPEs. Polyclonal antibodies, which recognized nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins, detected viral N and M proteins in virus-infected Vero E6 cells at least 6 and 12 h post-infection (h.p.i.), respectively. Furthermore, detection of DNA ladder and cleaved caspase-3 in the virus-infected cells at 24 h.p.i. indicated that SARS-CoV infection induced apoptotic cell death. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was significantly upregulated at 18 h.p.i. in SARS-CoV-infected cells. The downstream targets of p38 MAPK, MAPKAPK-2, HSP-27, CREB, and eIF4E were phosphorylated in virus-infected cells. The p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, inhibited effectively phosphorylation of HSP-27, CREB, and eIF4E in SARS-CoV-infected cells. However, viral protein synthesis was not affected by treatment of SB203580.",

In the period from February to June 2003, 32 countries were affected by SARS. SARS-CoV is a positive-strand RNA virus, and its genome is composed of about 29,700 nucleotides. The genomic organization of SARS-CoV is that of a typical coronavirus, and sequentially contains genes encoding polymerase (and polymerase-related proteins), spike, envelope, membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Three groups of coronaviruses were known prior to SARS, while phylogenic analysis indicated SARS-CoV to be a member of a fourth group [1, 2] .

In particular, p38 MAPK is strongly activated by stress and inflammatory cytokines. In the case of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a prototype coronavirus, virus-infected cells showed induction of p38 MAPK [7] . The SARS-CoV N protein has been reported to be involved in the regulation of cellular signaling pathways [8] . The levels of transcription factors binding to promoter sequences of c-Fos, ATF-2, CREB-1, and Fos B, which are related to AP-1, were increased by expression of N protein. However, there have been no previous reports regarding activation of signaling pathways by infection with SARS-CoV. In addition, no information is available regarding the molecular mechanisms of the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-infection. In the present study, we demonstrated that infection of Vero E6 cells by SARS-CoV induced apoptotic cell death and that p38 MAPK and its downstream targets were phosphorylated during viral replication. Understanding the mechanisms of p38 MAPK activation may lead to successful strategies for targeting these molecules in the therapy of SARS.",

To confirm whether SARS-CoV-infection induces apoptosis in Vero E6 cells, cellular DNA was extracted from SARS-CoV-infected cells. At 24 h.p.i., DNA fragmentation typical of apoptosis was observed (Fig. 2B) . Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) also induces apoptosis in infected Vero cells. Caspase-3, which is one of the main effector caspases and is activated in response to both intracellular and extracellular death signals, was activated by IBV infection [14] . To confirm whether caspase-3 is activated by SARS-CoV-infection, Western blotting analysis was performed using anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody. During apoptosis, caspase precursors are cleaved at Asp-X sites generating a large and a small subunit, which together constitute the active protease; the anti-caspase-3 antibody used in this study can specifically recognize the large fragment of cleaved caspase-3. As shown in Fig. 2C , the cleaved caspase-3 was detected in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells as a peak at 24 h.p.i. These results indicated that SARS-CoV induces apoptosis in the infected cells.",

Synthetic dsRNA poly(I)-poly(C) activates p38 MAPK and JNK/ SAPK pathways in fibroblasts [15] : hence, doublestranded RNA intermediates of SARS-CoV that accumulate in infected cells may also trigger the p38 MAPK activation pathway. It was reported that p38 MAPK was activated in MHV-infected cells, and MHV replication has been shown to be necessary for p38 MAPK activation [7] . Therefore, the kinetics of p38 MAPK activation in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells were analyzed. Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV at an m.o.i. of 5, and cell extracts were prepared at various times p.i. Western blotting analysis indicated an increase in the amount of phosphorylated p38 MAPK in the cells (Fig. 3) . The p38 MAPK phosphorylation was not transient and reached the maximal level at 18 h.p.i. The role of p38 MAPK signaling pathway in cellular responses is diverse, depending on the cell type and stimulation. Thus, the p38 MAPK signaling pathway promotes both cell death and survival [16] [17] [18] . Therefore, investigation of the p38 MAPK-downstream targets is important to understand the mechanisms of cell death induced by SARS-CoV-infection.",

CREB was identified as an activator that responds to the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway and is also known to mediate an important survival signal under various conditions [22] [23] [24] . For example, the anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are activated transcriptionally by phosphorylation of CREB in response to insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I stimulation in PC-12 cells [25, 26] . Immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5) indicated that the level of phosphorylated CREB was increased by SARS-CoV-infection. The antiphospho CREB antibody used in this study also recognizes activation transcription factor (ATF)-1, which is a transcription factor. ATF-1 is a member of the CREB/ ATF family that is phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) [27] . ATF-1 and CREB act as survival factors [28] . This result suggested that phosphorylation of CREB and ATF-1 induces an antiapoptotic environment in SARS-CoV-infected cells.",

Phosphorylated ATF-1 was also detected using anti-phospho CREB antibody. p38 MAPK inhibitor in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells.

We showed that SARS-CoV-infection of permissive cells induced the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. As Fig. 7 . Effective doses of p38 MAPK inhibitor. SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells were treated with SB203580 (p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor), PD98059 (ERK1/2-specific inhibitor), and SP600125 (JNKspecific inhibitor) for 18 h. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-phosphorylated HSP-27, CREB eIF4E antibodies. SARS-CoV N protein was also detected. p38 MAPK is able to promote both cell death and survival [33] , the substrates examined in this study and the other substrates of p38 MAPK may also induce cell death. Further studies are needed to determine which target molecules of p38 MAPK have inductive and preventative effects on apoptosis. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of activation of signaling transduction due to SARS-CoV-infection.",
