The recent identification of two influenza-like virus genomes (designated H17N10 and H18N11) from bats has challenged this notion. A crucial question concerns the role bats might play in influenza virus ecology. Structural and functional studies of the two major surface envelope proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), demonstrate that neither has canonical HA or NA functions found in influenza viruses. However, putative functional modules and domains in other encoded proteins are conserved, and the N-terminal domain of the H17N10 polymerase subunit PA has a classical structure and function. Therefore, potential genomic reassortments of such influenza-like viruses with canonical influenza viruses cannot be excluded at this point and should be assessed.",

There are three types of influenza virus based on its internal proteins of nucleoprotein and matrix protein, namely A, B, and C [1] . Among these, influenza A virus is the most prevalent pathogen for both humans and animals, causing the so-called seasonal flu. Influenza A virus was also the causative agent of four major pandemics, in other words the 1918 Spanish flu, 1957 Asian flu, 1968 Hong Kong flu, and the 2009 swine-origin pandemic flu (2009 pH1N1), as well as of the relatively milder pandemic, the 1977 Russian flu [2] [3] [4] . For the origin, genesis and ecology of influenza viruses, migratory birds (shorebirds and waterfowls) are regarded as reservoir hosts, providing a large pool of virus gene segments that can contribute to novel reassortant viruses [5] [6] [7] . Meanwhile, swine are believed to be 'mixing vessels' or at least intermediate hosts that influenza A viruses can utilize to 'jump' from poultry to humans [5] .",

USA [12] caused some concerns because a new influenza virus genome (H17N10) was isolated from bats by next-generation sequencing (NGS). This raised a serious scientific and public health question as to the origin and evolution of influenza virus. If this genome can produce a real influenza virus that can cause human or animal infections, then the situation for influenza virus-caused diseases would be more complicated because bats are known to harbor many viruses and are regarded as a reservoir host for many human-and animal-infecting viruses, including the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus [13] . If this is the case, then our understanding of the influenza virus ecology will need to be rewritten. Therefore research on this NGS-identified novel genome is urgently needed for the sake of public health. Studies on the two surface envelope proteins, HA and NA (NA-like) [14] [15] [16] [17] , demonstrate that neither protein has the corresponding canonical influenza virus functions or structures [18] . Therefore the new genome does not represent a 'true' influenza virus, and it should be renamed influenza-like virus, at most. Whether or not the genomic segments will reassort with canonical influenza A virus genomes should be vigorously tested in the near future. Recently a similar virus genome, H18N11, was again identified by NGS, and neither HA nor NA have canonical structures or functions [19] .",

Previously solved HA structures demonstrate that there are group-specific features at sites where extensive conformational changes occur for HA activation, including the conformation of the interhelix loop and the rigid body orientation of the globular domain [22] . Taking H17 as an example, it displays a similar interhelix loop conformation to the HAs from group 1, and this is consistent with the phylogenetic analysis. Superimposition with other solved HA structures by means of the long central a-helices of HA2 revealed that the globular domains fall into three subgroups [16, 23] : subgroup 1, including H1, H2, H5, and H9; subgroup 2, including H3, H7, and H14; and subgroup 3, consisting of H13, H16, H17 and H18. These differences may result from subtle variation in the interhelix loops among different HA subtypes and could signify different mechanisms during HA activation [16, 23] .",

The receptors for influenza A viruses are sialic acids (SA) linked to cell surface glycolipids or glycoproteins [24] [25] [26] . After entering the cells, the virus fuses with the endosomal membrane under low pH and subsequently the genetic material is released into the cell [22, [27] [28] [29] [30] . Avian-and human-adapted influenza A viruses harbor distinct HA molecules that have different capacities to bind specifically linked SA-moieties. In Figure 2 , the configurations of the a-2,3-linked SA and a-2,6-linked SA are shown. The molecular basis of the interaction of these specific receptors with the virus-derived HA has been extensively studied [22, [27] [28] [29] [30] . In the trimeric structure of the HA, resolved as early as in 1981 in an outstanding collaborative work by Wilson, Wiley, and Skehel [31] , the HA head domain of each monomer was shown to be responsible for SA binding. We now know that there are three secondary elements and one base element involved directly in SA binding. The three secondary elements (the 130-loop, the 190-helix, and the 220-loop, in H3 numbering) form the edge portion, and four conserved residues (Y98, W153, H183, and Y195) form the base portion. These two portions usually form a shallow cavity to accommodate sialylated glycans. Typically, the SA moiety of the sialylated glycan forms several conserved hydrogen bonds with the 130-loop and the base residue Y98, and the remaining glycan moieties interact with the 220-loop or 190-helix.",

For H2 and H3 HAs, Q226L and G228S substitutions in the 220-loop are responsible for the switch between avian and human receptor binding specificities [30, 32] whereas, for H1 HA, different combinations of substitutions at residues 190 and 225 are important for the SA binding preference [33, 34] . For H5 HA, a single Q226L substitution is enough to change the receptor binding preference [35, 36] . By contrast, for H7 HAs, Q226L substitution is not solely responsible for the acquisition of human receptor binding, and other amino acid substitutions also contribute to the receptor binding switch, especially G186 V substitution [37, 38] . Multiple lines of evidence, including surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments, MDCK cell binding assays, and glycan microarray analysis, revealed that the batderived H17 and H18 do not bind to canonical human or avian receptors [16, 17, 19] . This lack of canonical receptor binding is likely due to specific structural features in the putative receptor binding sites of H17 and H18 HA. In the H17 and H18 structures ( Figure 3 ) there is no obvious cavity to accommodate the sialylated glycans, due to strong interactions among three secondary elements (130-loop, 190-helix, and 220-loop) through a hydrogen bond and salt bridge network formed by residues D136, Q190, H226, and D228 [16, 19] . Furthermore, the negatively charged D136 in the 130-loop (all canonical influenza HAs have an uncharged threonine or serine at this position) could result in a charge conflict with the negatively charged carboxyl group of SA, which is unfavorable for SA receptor binding [16, 19] . Moreover, residue 98 (usually a conserved tyrosine) in the base of the receptor binding site is a phenylalanine in H17 and H18, and this could also affect SA receptor binding capacity. Thus, these five key residues likely contribute to the lack of SA receptor binding by H17 and H18 and make the putative binding cavity a much smaller, pseudo-binding site (a 'closed' site) ( Figure 3) .",

            "text": "The possibility remains that we may have not detected the binding of H17 and H18 to canonical human or avian receptors using the soluble protein in vitro because it is plausible that a stronger interaction may occur through receptor clustering in vivo. It is also possible that H17 and H18 may bind to canonical influenza receptors very weakly, below the level of our detection (which is a limitation of the available methods). However, together with the extensive amino acid changes in the receptor binding site of H17 and H18 protein, it is likely that the putative bat influenza virus has acquired a different receptor, possibly protein-based. There are many examples of closely related viruses that switch between protein and SA receptors, for example, paramyxoviruses. The most common type of the paramyxovirus attachment protein recognizes SA receptors. It is called hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and is found on viruses such as Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and human parainfluenza virus 3 (hPIV3), and recognizes SA receptors. The structures of the globular heads of HN proteins display a conserved b-sheet propeller motif, which was identified originally in influenza virus NA, and an SA binding site located in the central cavity of the proteins [39, 40] . Unlike HN, the hemagglutinin (H) of measles virus (MV), which also belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family, possesses an inactivated SA receptor binding site and recognizes specific proteins, such as signal lymphocyteactivating molecule (SLAM), CD46, and nectin-4 [41] [42] [43] . The structure of the globular heads of H protein still reveals a conserved b-sheet propeller motif, and the specific protein receptors bind to the side part of H protein with different orientations [44] . In particular, the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like SLAM molecule binds to the H protein mainly through interactions between two b-sheets. Interestingly, the bat-derived influenza-like virus H17/H18 and N10/N11 proteins have similar Ig-like fold elements [14] [15] [16] [17] 19] , which possibly provide the b-sheets that could interact with putative protein-based receptors. If the H17 and H18 protein should lose its trimerization state and expose its Ig-like fold element, it might be able to bind a specific protein receptor. In this case, the bat-derived influenza-like virus would abrogate the need for an active N10 and N11. This hypothesis or notion needs further experimental work to be confirmed or rejected. Thus, the bat-derived H17 and H18 are unique among the characterized HAs and might use a different entry mechanism. NA-like molecules N10 and N11 are not sialidases NA is the second virus-surface envelope protein and is a sialidase, responsible for cleavage of SA from glycans on the host cell surface to release the emerging progeny virus, prevent virus aggregation, and help virus migration [45, 46] . Therefore it has an opposite function from HA, SA-binding versus SA-releasing. If bat-derived HA does not bind SA, consequently it would have no need for a sialidase to help release the virus particles. There are nine subtypes (N1-N9) of NA identified so far, before the discovery of the NA-like N10 or N11 genes from bat. Similarly to HA, NA has also been classified into two groups, group 1 and group 2, based on primary sequences [47] (Figure 1 ). N1, N4, N5, and N8 are group 1 members and N2, N3, N6, N7, and N6 belong to group 2. It is clearly shown from the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1 ) that N10 and N11 are genetically far away from NA molecules found on canonical influenza A viruses (N1-N9), thereby forming a unique cluster, which we propose to name group 3.",

In both structures the active sites are a more opened form with no clue as to how the SA is accommodated. In fact, when scrutinized the primary sequences of both N10 and N11 show diversified amino acid usages in both the active and the framework sites. Only three of eight active site (R118, R224, and E276) and three (four for N11) of 11 framework (S179, D198, E425, and W178-N11) amino acids are conserved. Therefore the structures do not support a neuraminidase function. Indeed, no sialidase enzymatic activities were detected in either N10 or N11 proteins when tested in vitro [14, 15, 19] . Therefore they are not canonical NA proteins, and instead are NA-like molecules. N10 and N11 might function as a receptor binding protein via their Ig-like folds, as discussed in the previous section. Thus, alterations of the conserved NA active site architecture observed in both bat-derived N10 and N11, combined with evidence for a lack of sialidase activity, indicates that they may have an unknown function distinct from canonical influenza NAs.",

These proteins include PA, PB1, PB2, PB1-N40, PB1-F2, PA-X, NP, M1, M2, M42, NS1, and NS2 ( Figure 5 ). Two additional proteins of N-truncated PAs, PA-N155, and PA-N182, have also been reported [60] . M1 is the third virussurface envelope protein and NP is responsible for viral RNA binding to form ribonucleoprotein (vRNP), which then combines with PB1, PB2, and PA to form the vRNP complex, a core apparatus responsible for proper virus replication [5] . Previous studies on influenza virus have shown that NP binds to viral RNA destined for transcription by PB1, that harbors a canonical RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain, in conjunction with PB2, with cap-binding capacity, that together form the polymerase complex [61] . PB1 also binds directly to the C-terminal domain of PA [62, 63] . The N-terminal domain of PA (PAn) functions as an endonuclease to generate small RNA primers that are essential for initiation of viral gene transcription [64, 65] . This cleavage of host-derived RNA occurs in a sequence-specific manner [66, 67] . Tong and coworkers demonstrated that the combination of NP, PB1, PB2, and PA derived from bat H17N10 is able to transcribe RNA in an influenza A mini-genome reporter assay, and this activity was abrogated when PB1 was removed from the complex [12] .",

The catalytically conserved residues, including H41, E80, D108, E119, and K134, are ordered in close proximity such that they can accommodate a manganese ion in the center. As expected from the structure, H17N10 PAn possesses manganese-dependent endonuclease activity on both single-stranded DNA and RNA. When the endonuclease activity of H17N10 PAn was compared to that of avian (H5N1) and human (pH1N1) origins, no obvious differences were observed. Similarly to H5N1 PAn [65] , the activity of H17N10 PAn is lost by substituting the key active histidine residue at position 41 for an alanine. These observations demonstrate the functional competence of H17N10 PAn as an influenza viral endonuclease, indicating that H17N10 possesses at least one protein domain that suggests an influenza-like life cycle. More experimental work on the other protein molecules or their functional modules should be done to reveal the complete life cycle.",

So far we have not isolated the virus from bats, and we suspect that this genome or virus should be, at most, called influenza-like virus or even a completely new name for the sake of public health concerns in view of the wide public knowledge about potential influenza pandemics. However, it is possible that the determined genomic sequences do not correspond to a functional virus because they may contain mutations originating from the non-functional viruses present in the bats. More work therefore needs to be done, such as the isolation of the virus or more sequences to be determined from the bats. Otherwise, the reassortment ability of the six internal gene segments of either the H17N10 or the H18N11 genome should be examined soon. If reassortment ever occurred, though doubtful, our understanding of influenza virus ecology would be changed and the range of reservoir and 'mixing vessel' hosts for influenza virus would need to be expanded. Furthermore, we are also expecting more HxNy viruses to be discovered from bats in the future (Box 1).",
