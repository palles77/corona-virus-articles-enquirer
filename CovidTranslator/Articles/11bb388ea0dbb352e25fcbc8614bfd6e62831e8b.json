Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is another deadly virus and causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Rapid and early detection of these viruses will facilitate early intervention and reduce disease transmission risk. Here, we present an All-In-One Dual CRISPR-Cas12a (termed \"AIOD-CRISPR\") assay method for simple, rapid, ultrasensitive, one-pot, and visual detection of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and HIV virus. In our AIOD CRISPR assay, a pair of crRNAs was introduced to initiate dual CRISPR-Cas12a detection and improve detection sensitivity. The AIOD-CRISPR assay system was successfully utilized to detect nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV with a sensitivity of few copies. Also, it was evaluated by detecting HIV-1 RNA extracted from human plasma samples, achieving a comparable sensitivity with real-time RT-PCR method. Thus, our method has a great potential for developing next-generation point-of-care molecular diagnostics.",

In recent decades, several isothermal amplification methods, such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) 7 , loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) 8 , have been developed as attractive alternatives to conventional PCR method because of their simplicity, rapidity and low cost. However, there is still a challenge to apply it to develop a reliable POC diagnostics for clinical applications due to non-specific signals (e.g., false-positive). 9, 10 Recently, RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas nuclease-based nucleic acid detection has shown great promise for the development of next-generation molecular diagnostics technology due to its high sensitivity, specificity and reliability. 11, 12 For example, some Cas nucleases (e.g., Cas12a, Cas12b and Cas13a) perform strong collateral cleavage activities in which a crRNA-targetbinding activated Cas can indiscriminately cleave surrounding non-target single-stranded nucleic acids. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 By combining with RPA preamplification, Cas13 and Cas12a have, respectively, been used to develop SHERLOCK (Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing) system 18 and DETECTR (DNA Endonuclease-Targeted CRISPR Trans Reporter) system 14 for highly sensitive nucleic acid detection.

Dual crRNAs are introduced to initiate highly efficient CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection. In our AIOD-CRISPR assay, all components for nucleic acid amplification and CRISPR detection are thoroughly mixed in a single, one-pot reaction system and incubated at a single temperature (e.g., 37 \u00b0C), eliminating the need for separate preamplification and amplified product transferring. As application examples, the AIOD-CRISPR assay was engineered to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 19 and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). 20 Since SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 are retrovirus, we evaluated the performance of our AIOD-CRISPR assay by detecting both of their DNA and RNA. Especially, the test results of our AIOD-CRISPR assay can be directly visualized by naked eye. Therefore, we anticipate that the AIOD-CRISPR assay will facilitate CRISPRbased next-generation molecular diagnostics towards point-of-care applications. Figure 1A , the AIOD-CRISPR assay system used a pair of Cas12a-crRNA complexes generated by two individual crRNAs to bind two corresponding sites which are close to the recognition sites of primers in the target sequence. The Cas12a-crRNA complexes were separately prepared prior to being loaded into the solution containing two RPA primers, ssDNA-FQ reporters, recombinase, single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB), strand-displacement DNA polymerase, and target sequences. When incubating the AIOD-CRISPR system in one pot at 37\u00b0C, RPA amplification is first initiated and exposes the binding sites of the Cas12a-crRNA complexes due to the strand displacement. Once the Cas12a-crRNA complexes bind the target sites, Cas12a endonuclease is activated and cleaves the nearby ssDNA-FQ reporters to produce fluorescence. Similarly, RPA amplified products are also the substrates to undertake the same process and continuously trigger CRISPR-Cas12a-based collateral cleavage activity. Previous study 14, 17 has demonstrated that this collateral cleavage activity is irrelevant to target strand cleavage in CRISPR-Cas12a system. Therefore, target sequences for the AIOD-CRISPR assay are not limited by the Cas12a's protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) 21 .",

Furthermore, the assay products were verified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). As shown in Figure 1B (ii), a strong band with shorter DNA size was observed only in the lane of the reaction # 5, which resulted from the cleaved ssDNA-FQ reporter with bright fluorescence. On the contrary, for other reaction systems, only weak bands with slightly longer DNA sizes were observed in their corresponding lanes due to fluorescence quench of the intact uncut ssDNA-FQ reporters. In addition, in real-time fluorescence detection, only the reaction # 5 showed an elevated fluorescence signals that saturated within 13 min ( Figure 1B(iii) ).

We prepared two AIOD-CRISPR solutions (one positive and one negative) and allowed them to remain at room temperature for 10 min. As shown in Figure S1 , no significant fluorescence change between positive and negative samples was observed in the AIOD-CRISPR solutions at room temperature. On the contrary, there was an obvious fluorescence increasing after just one-min incubation at 37\u00b0C ( Figure  S1 ). The fluorescence signal was eventually saturated at 15 min after incubated at 37\u00b0C. Therefore, our AIOD-CRISPR assay system is mainly triggered only after reaction temperature arrives at 37\u00b0C. Optimization of AIOD-CRISPR assay. Collateral cleavage of ssDNA-FQ reporter by the Cas12a is triggered by the binding of crRNA to target sites. 13, 14 Thus, we hypothesized that higher binding opportunities could increase the collateral cleavage activity and eventually improve the detection sensitivity for AIOD-CRISPR. To prove this, we introduced a pair of crRNAs to recognize the corresponding target sites. A pUCIDT-AMP plasmid containing 300 bp HIV-1 p24 gene cDNA (p24 plasmid) was used as the target and three different designs for primers and crRNAs were investigated (Figure 2A) . As shown in Figure 2B , AIOD-CRISPR with dual crRNAs (crRNA1+crRNA2) shows similar fluorescence curve as that with crRNA2, but was much better than using crRNA1 in real-time detection. Doubling the amount of crRNA1 or crRNA2 actually didn't benefit the detection efficiency. On detection sensitivity, Figure 2C shows that AIOD-CRISPR with dual crRNAs was able to detect as low as 1.2 copies of the p24 plasmid templates within 40 min, while AIOD-CRISPR with single crRNA2 doesn't detect it. Thus, introducing dual crRNAs is beneficial to improve the sensitivity of AIOD-CRISPR assay.",

The HIV RNA target is a 1057-nt fragment of gag (p24 included) gene prepared using T7 promotor-tagged RT-PCR and T7 RNA polymerase-based transcription ( Figure S4A) . The detection region of AIOD-CRISPR was further verified by Sanger sequencing (Figure S4B ). To achieve highly sensitive HIV RNA detection, we optimized the AMV concentration. As shown in Figure S4C , the RT-AIOD-CRISPR performed the highest efficiency with 0.32 U/\u03bcL AMV when incubated at 37\u00b0C. Furthermore, we investigated the sensitivity of our RT-AIOD-CRISPR assay using 1.1\u00d7 10 0 ,1.1\u00d7 10 1 , 1.1\u00d7 10 3 , and 1.1\u00d7 10 5 copies of HIV-1 gag RNA templates. Figure 4A shows that RT-AIOD-CRISPR incubated for 40 min at 37\u00b0C was able to consistently detect 11 copies RNA targets in realtime, endpoint fluorescence, and visual detections under LED blue and UV light. However, visual detection without excitation light only identified 1.1\u00d7 10 5 copies RNA targets due to unsaturated fluorescence for other reactions. Additionally, the RT-AIOD-CRISPR's sensitivity was further confirmed by denaturing PAGE analysis ( Figure S5 ). In addition to assaying artificial HIV-1 gag RNA, we also analysed RT-AIOD-CRISPR's performance using HIV-1 RNA extracted from plasma samples. As shown in Figure 4B , realtime RT-AIO-Cas12aR-based detection was able to detect the viral RNA extracted from 500 copies/\u03bcL HIV-1 plasma sample, though displaying low fluorescence change in less than 20 min. However, visual RT-AIOD-CRISPR detection took relatively long incubation time (up to 90 min) to achieve the similar sensitivity. The reduced efficiency of RT-AIOD-CRISPR likely results from some potential inhibitors or disruptors in the extracts. Despite this, real-time AIOD-CRISPR assay was still comparable to real-time RT-PCR assay regarding the same detection sensitivity (Figure 4C and S6) . Figure 5A , a pUCIDT-AMP plasmid containing 384 nt SARS-CoV-2 N gene cDNA (N plasmid) was first prepared as the target to develop our AIOD-CRISPR assay. Figure 5B shows that our AIOD-CRISPR assay could detect 1.3 copies of SARS-CoV-2 N plasmids in both real-time and visual detections within 40 min, offering a rapid and nearly single-molecule level sensitive detection. To evaluate the detection specificity, we tested our AIOD-CRISPR assay using commercially available control plasmids containing the complete N gene from SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 _PC), SARS (SARS-CoV_PC), and MERS (MERS-CoV_PC), as well as the Hs_RPP30 control (Hs_RPP30_PC) with a portion of human RPP30 gene.

            "text": "Compared to previously reported CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection, 14, 16, 18, 23, 24, 25 our versatile and robust AIOD-CRISPR has some distinctive advantages. First, AIOD-CRISPR system is a true single reaction system. All the components are prepared prior to incubation, thoroughly circumventing the preamplification of target nucleic acids, 14 physical separation of Cas enzyme, 25 or the requirement of specially designed tubes or devices 26 . Second, AIOD-CRISPR is a true isothermal nucleic acid detection method. AIOD-CRISPR is conducted in one-step and one-pot format at one temperature, eliminating the need of expensive thermocycler in PCR methods and the initial denaturing of dsDNA targets in isothermal nucleic acid amplification techniques such as LAMP 8 and SDA 27 . Third, AIOD-CRISPR-based detection is very fast, robust, highly specific, and nearly single-molecule sensitive. In the application examples of HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 detections, our engineered AIOD-CRISPR without preamplification is able to detect as low as 1.2 copies DNA targets and 4.6 copies RNA targets in 40 min incubation. Especially in detecting HIV-1 p24 plasmids, AIOD-CRISPR can stably identify 1.2 copies in just 1 min incubation. For emerging SARS-CoV-2, in addition to high sensitivity, the AIOD-CRISPR also performs high detection specificity. Compared to the reported real-time RPA 28 , AIOD-CRISPR shows a robust HIV-1 detection with very low background. Fourth, the AIOD-CRISPR enables one-step CRISPR-Cas12a-based RNA detection. By supplementing AMV reverse transcriptase, AIOD-CRISPR can be easily developed as one-step RT-AIOD-CRISPR to detect RNA targets such as HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RNAs, which facilitates the CRISPR-Cas12a-based RNA detection without the preparation of cDNA. On detecting HIV-1 plasma samples, AIOD-CRISPR is comparable to real-time RT-PCR assay.",
