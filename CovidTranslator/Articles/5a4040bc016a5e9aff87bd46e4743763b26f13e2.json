It may be advantageous to ship these samples cooled in warm climes or during hotter time periods to prevent bacterial growth and antibody destruction. Proper sampling and shipment for virus detection may be more involved. For many assays (eg, antigen detection assays), the virus need not remain viable. In these situations, rapid shipment and cooling during transport are not required. For some assays, however, degradation of the virus during transport will necessitate cooling during shipment. This often is true for genetic detection that uses polymerase chain reaction. Many viral genomes, especially those of RNA viruses, are labile. For virus propagation, the virus must remain infectious from the moment it is collected until it reaches the laboratory. This requires rapid, cooled transport [1, 2] . Some viruses are inactivated by freezing; therefore, as long as shipment is speedy, refrigeration/cold packs generally are sufficient [1] . Communication with the laboratory regarding shipping requirements will assist in the proper transport.",

Usually, samples are collected from the disease lesions, using swabs, fluids, and tissue samples. Various secretions/excretions can be collected, depending on the mode of virus shedding. Viruses in which a viremic phase occurs following exposure may be isolated from blood; however, this most often is possible only in the early stages of infection. Collection of virus for virus isolation optimally is done in the acute phase. Later in infection or during chronic infection, the presence of host antibody may inhibit virus growth in the laboratory. The speed of shipment that is required depends on the lability of the virus; nonenveloped viruses tend to be hardier and less susceptible to inactivation than enveloped viruses [4] . Because the identity of the virus usually is not known, overnight shipment on cold pack is ideal. Certain information should be provided to the laboratory to facilitate the chances of successful propagation (eg, species, history, clinical presentation). Cell lines that are used vary with the suspected virus; any information that can assist the diagnostician in the appropriate selection of propagation medium is helpful.",

Specific identification usually is done through the use of virus-specific antibody in an assay, such as immunofluorescence. Alternatively, a virus activity may be exploited to identify the virus. For example, the virus of Newcastle disease, avian paramyxovirus-1, agglutinates chicken red blood cells (RBCs).

Obviously, the virus must remain viable during shipment which can be a problem with certain labile viruses (eg, herpesviruses). Rapid shipment in refrigeration is required which may add to the cost. The presence of other components (eg, bacteria, toxins) can interfere with the ability of the virus to grow in the laboratory. For example, hepatic viruses can be difficult to isolate because of the presence of cell culture toxins in the liver tissue [2] . This also is true if neutralizing antibodies are present.

Generally speaking, approximately 10 6 particles per gram of sample are required for visualization [1, 4, 5] . More may be required for small viruses, such as parvovirus. Because of this, electron microscopy usually is restricted to testing of feces in cases of enteritis where virus concentration is significant in the acute phase of disease. For example, in diarrhea that is caused by parvovirus, the animal may be shedding more than 10 9 particles per gram. It also is used to identify viruses in cell culture, where the virus has been amplified through growth in the laboratory. It is too insensitive to detect virus in most tissue, fluid, or swab samples. These require propagation before detection. One exception to this may be poxviruses. Because of their large size, they may be seen in samples from lesions.",

This sensitivity is even lower in chronic infections where the presence of host antibody can block the binding of the detecting antibody [6, 7] . In general, a positive result ''rules in'' but a negative result does not ''rule out.'' Also, because it is a specific assay, it does not detect the presence of other pathogens (eg, an IFA assay for felid herpesvirus on a conjunctival scraping will be negative if the pathogen involved is calicivirus). Finally, technical expertise is required to interpret IFA assays. The reader must be familiar with the pattern of fluorescence and have the ability to distinguish viral fluorescence from background or nonspecific fluorescence. Experience is thus required for proper interpretation of IFA assays.",

Some available assays include feline leukemia virus, canine parvovirus, rotavirus, equine influenza virus, and bovine viral diarrhea virus. Most use pathogen-specific antibody for capture and detection as for IFA assays (Fig. 4B) . The antibody is anchored in a solid substrate, such as a membrane or plastic well. The sample, usually in fluid form, is added. The initial sample collected may be fluid (eg, serum for feline leukemia virus) or the sample may be solubilized in a diluent using a swab (eg, feces for parvovirus). If the virus is present, it will be bound by the anchored antibody. This is followed by soluble pathogen-specific antibody with enzyme attached, which will bind the bound virus. Addition of the substrate for the enzyme leads to a color change. Washing is a critical step in many ELISA assays to ensure unbound antibody is removed. Variations on this protocol may be found with different assays, but the underlying technique of pathogen-specific antibody binding the virus in the sample is similar in all (Fig. 4) [1, 3, 4] .",

These assays can be invaluable in attaining the correct diagnosis, but a clear understanding of the assay and the results is essential. To this end, communication with the laboratory personnel is crucial. Optimal sample selection, shipping recommendations, assay selection, and interpretation should be discussed with the laboratory staff.",

Formation of an immune complex by the binding of patient antibody to the virus leads to activation of the complement cascade. In the assay system, the incubation of virus with patient's serum is done with the addition of guinea pig complement. If antibody is present, the complement is activated and effectively exhausted. After the incubation, sheep RBCs, to which antibody has been attached, are added. These are, in effect, immune complexes. If the complement has been exhausted, the RBCs are not lysed by complement. If no antibody was present in the patient's serum, addition of the sensitized RBCs leads to complement activation and RBC lysis [1, 3] . Most complement fixation assays quantitate the amount of antibody. Because IgM and IgG can activate complement, both will be detected. Generally, complement fixation is not used as widely as other antibody detection assays.",

Therefore, the RBCs will pellet in the well. The highest dilution at which agglutination of the RBCs is inhibited is reported as the titer (Fig. 9 ). This assay measures antibody to epitopes on the surface protein of the virus.
