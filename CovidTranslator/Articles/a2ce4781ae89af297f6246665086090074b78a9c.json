Many studies have shown that transient delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) or adenovirus-mediated RNA interfere (RNAi) could potentially inhibit porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) replication in vivo and in vitro. Here, we applied RNAi to produce transgenic (TG) pigs that constitutively expressed PRRSV-specific siRNA derived from small hairpin RNA (shRNA). First, we evaluated siRNA expression in the founding and F1 generation pigs and confirmed stable transmission. Then, we detected the expression of IFN-\u2424 and protein kinase R (PKR) and found no difference among TG, non-transgenic (NTG), and wild-type pigs. Lastly, the F1 generation pigs, including TG and NTG piglets, were challenged with 3 \u00d7 10 4.5 TCID 50 of JXA1, a highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV). Our results showed that the in vivo siRNA expression substantially reduced the serum HP-PRRSV titers and increased survival time by 3 days when TG pigs were compared with the NTG controls. These data suggested that RNAi-based genetic modification might be used to breed viral-resistant livestock with stable siRNA expression with no complications of siRNA toxicity.",

PRRS is characterized by severe reproductive failure in gilts and respiratory illness in pigs of all ages. The etiological agent PRRS virus (PRRSV) is a member of the family Arteriviridae that contains a linear, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome and transcripts using a unique mechanism involving discontinuous subgenomic synthesis (Meulenberg et al., 1993) . And an unprecedented \"high fever\" disease caused by HP-PRRSV broke out in China in 2006, which spread more than 10 provinces and brought about 4,000,000 fatal cases (Tian et al., 2007) . Currently, the principal method to control and prevent PRRSV infection is vaccination. However, the vaccines are unable to provide potent and lasting disease control because of the immune evasion strategies of PRRSV and the heterogeneity of its genome (Thanawongnuwech and Suradhat, 2010) .",

            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is an RNA-guided sequence-specific process in which small interfering RNA (siRNA) induces posttranscriptional gene silencing. RNA silencing was initially recognized as an anti-viral mechanism to protect host organisms from RNA viral infections (Waterhouse et al., 2001) . Many studies have confirmed antiviral immunity mediated by virus-derived small interfering RNAs (viRNAs) in plants and invertebrates, although viRNAs have not been identified in mammals which have evolved the interferon (IFN) pathway instead (Ding and Voinnet, 2007) . It has been demonstrated that siRNA can elicit specific intracellular antiviral resistance and may, therefore, be a valuable therapeutic tool (Gitlin et al., 2002) . Hence, RNAi has great potential for the inhibition of RNA viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Since the first reported case of RNAi therapy against human pathogen respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Bitko and Barik, 2001) , many other types of human viruses have been successfully targeted, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (Coburn and Cullen, 2002) , hepatitis C virus (Kronke et al., 2004) , hepatitis B virus (McCaffrey et al., 2003) , severe acute respiratory syndrome (He et al., 2003) , and influenza A virus (Ge et al., 2003) . Subsequently, many viruses infecting large farm animals have also been chosen as therapy targets, such as foot and mouth disease virus (Chen et al., 2006) , porcine circovirus virus type 2 (Feng et al., 2008) , porcine endogenous retrovirus (Ramsoondar et al., 2009) , and PRRSV (Guo et al., 2013) .",

Although it has been shown that transient delivery of siRNA by targeting viral genes protects susceptible cell lines (He et al., 2007) , stable transgenic cell line presented stable inhibition to virus (Zhou et al., 2012) , and recombinant adenovirusmediated RNAi guards animals against viral challenges , it remains unclear whether transgenesis of siRNA in pigs can confer permanent resistance against PRRSV infection. Previously, we designed siRNAs to target the open reading frame (ORF) 1b and 6 regions of PRRSV and showed that siRNA-1B372 targeting ORF1b had the strongest virus-inhibiting effect in MARC-145 cells. Importantly, the viral yield in siRNA-1B372-transfected cells was 600-fold lower than that in control cells (Bao et al., 2012) . ORF1b encodes non-structural proteins (NSP), including NSP 9-12, which plays a key role in the initiation of viral replication (Music and Gagnon, 2010) . Based on our previous in vitro data, our aim in the present study was to produce transgenic animals perpetually expressing siRNA-1B372 and then challenge these animals with PRRSV. Here, we report that we generated transgenic pigs with stable siRNA expression over two generations, and the reduction of PRRSV viremia was observed in them.",

Initially, we only examined siRNA expression in blood of the founder pigs because we needed to keep them alive for the following propagation. As shown in Fig. 3(a) , the siRNA levels in the blood of the transgenic pigs were similar and around 4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 when normalized to U6, which confirmed that they were derived from the same clone mass. After necropsy of the six F1 TG pigs, the siRNA levels in lung, tonsil, liver, blood, spleen and heart tissues were examined, and the ratio of siRNA/U6 RNA was approximately 10 \u22125 (Fig. 3b) . The results from the founder pigs showed that siRNA levels were close among the individuals, although they were diverse among different tissues. In addition, siRNA levels in blood were similar between the founder and F1 generation pigs. Thus, siRNA expression was stably transmitted over at least one generation.",

Then cells were infected by JXA1, and intracellular viral replication was detected. Viral growth was suppressed by about 13-folds at pi 12 h and 38-folds at pi 24 h as compared with NTG PAMs. At pi 48 h, no viral RNA could be detected due to the cell lysis while that of TG PAMs was around 20-folds of the reference sample (Fig. 6b) . Importantly, TG PAMs exhibited apparently relieved PRRSV-induced cytopathogenic effect (CPE) in comparison to NTG PAMs (Fig. 6c) . To further investigate the effect of RNA interference on PRRSV infection, we applied an immunofluorescence assay to detect PRRSV in PAMs. Results showed that PRRSV infection was suppressed in TG PAMs as compared with NTG PAMs at early stage of infection (pi 12 h). However, the difference between the two subjects became smaller at pi 24 h (Fig. 6d) . Taken together, transgenic siRNA inhibited the PRRSV replication in PAMs of TG pigs. Li et al. (2009) reported that adenovirus-mediated RNAi can inhibit PRRSV replication in swine, and a large proportion of reports on RNAi-based therapies thus far have evaluated viral vectors (see review in Davidson and McCray, 2011) . However, the safety and efficacy of RNAi are challenged by significant problems stemming The rectal temperatures of three groups (TG group, n = 5; NTG group, n = 4; IC group, n = 5) had been measured at 24-h intervals since 2 days before JXA1 infection until the end of the experiment. (b) Survival curves of pigs after PRRSV JXA1 infection. The pigs in the TGP group survived significantly longer than NTG group, 11 and 8 days, respectively (P < 0.05), and IC group was 12 days. (c) Viral growth curves in pigs of three groups. Serum samples were collected at the indicated times post-transfection. The Ct value of each sample was obtained by qRT-PCR and the corresponding TCID50 values were determined according to the standard curve. The viral loads of the TG pigs were significantly higher than those of NTG pigs on dpi 2, 4, and 6. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. (d) Antibody curves of the three groups. Specific antibodies of the PRRSV M protein was measured by ELISA (HerdCheck, Idexx Laboratories) at the indicated times. Results are expressed as S/P ratio averages. S/P ratios <0.4 were considered negative. Differences between the two S/P ratios (TG < IC) was significant at all indicated times (P < 0.01). Data in panels are presented as means \u00b1 SE. Statistical significance was analyzed using Student's-test. Fig. 6 . Transgenic siRNA in PAMs inhibited PRRSV replication. (a) qRT-PCR analysis of siRNA expression in PAMs isolated from TG pigs. The expression of siRNA was expressed as a relative ratio to U6. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD from three TG pigs. (b) qRT-PCR analysis of viral ORF7 RNA from TG and NTG PAMs both inoculated with PRRSV JXA1 for 12, 24 and 48 h. Fold change was generated by 2 \u2212 Ct . Ct = Ct(viral RNA) \u2212 Ct(GAPDH); Ct = Ct \u2212 Ct (reference, viral RNA at pi 12 h). The default fold of viral RNA at pi 12 h was 1. Data are representative of the results of three individuals (means \u00b1 SD). (c) PAMs of TG and NTG pigs were observed for development of CPE by bright-field microscopy at 24 h pi. (d) Immunofluorescence assay analysis of PRRSV N protein in TG and NTG PAMs infected with PRRSV JXA1 for 12 and 24 h. from host cellular and humoral immune responses (Huang and Yang, 2009 ). Here, we report for the first time transgenic pigs harboring RNA polymerase III promoter U6 driving a siRNA targeting a conserved region of the PRRSV genome. Moreover, according to the similar siRNA expression level in blood of two generations, we presumed that the siRNA expression in founder and F1 pigs was similar, which may indicate reliable and stable transgenic expression. More passages are needed to demonstrate the sustainable heredity of siRNA expression.",

Results of qRT-PCR and IFA in PRRSV-infected PAMs confirmed that integrated siRNA expression could also have the inhibitory effect on virus in vitro, which in turn prove that it is the transgenic siRNA reducing viral load of the blood in vivo.",

            "text": "A characteristic feature of RNA viruses, such as arteriviruses, is their high mutation rate, which allows them to adapt to and escape from host immune responses. Since RNAi relies on a perfect match between the siRNA and the target sequence in the viral RNA genome, even single mutations would suffice to abolish the antiviral effect of the siRNA (Du et al., 2005) . To avoid viral escape from RNAi, given our former work in cell line development, we selected the siRNA-1B372 which targeted the most conserved region of PRRSV genome among 20 siRNAs targeting ORFs 1b, 5, 6 and 7 (Bao et al., 2012) to generate the transgenic pigs. The highly pathogenic PRRSV strain, JXwn06 (GenBank accession number: EF641008) was used as a reference sequence for this study, and the target sequence of siRNA-1B372 was located in 9324-9335nt in the PRRSV genome, which sites in NSP9 coding region. This sequence is highly conserved in all American PRRSV strains, as confirmed by comparisons using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool algorithm on the National Center for Biotechnology Information website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Additionally, ORF1b encodes NSP 9-12, of which NSP9 is a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that plays a central role in viral replication (Wang et al., 2012) .",

            "text": "Although many studies have reported that the RNA polymerase III promoter can induce strong expression of siRNA, and others have found that RNAi vectors in mammalian cells may induce a distinct IFN response (Bridge et al., 2003) , our results showed that the siRNA expression in the transgenic pigs was low and no significant IFN response was detected. There could be the possibility that low siRNA expression account for the absence of IFN response. The positional effect (an effect of the local chromosomal environment on the levels or patterns of transgene expression) probably accounted for the low production of siRNA as the small inserted DNA fragments were likely subject to this effect. Therefore, developing new transgenic technology to improve the PRRSV specific RNAi could be helpful to enhance the antiviral capacity in pigs, such as artificial microRNA (Xia et al., 2013; Boudreau et al., 2009) . Nonetheless, stably expressed siRNA can still block PRRSV replication to some extent without causing any visible toxicity.",

In the present study, the transgenic pigs were able to reduce viral load in blood. The quantitative reduction of the amount of serum viral load may have impaired the forward transmission of PRRS, as previously described (Lyall et al., 2011) . Even though we are aware that the low production of siRNA can only induce moderate inhibition of PRRSV, RNAi combined with transgenic technology offers the possibility to genetically engineer livestock to promote resistance to viral infections.",
