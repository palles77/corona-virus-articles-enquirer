These patients were diagnosed as having incomplete or atypical KD, which refers to children presenting with either a fever characteristic of KD but with less than four classical signs of that disease or fever with accompanying coronary artery abnormalities on echocardiography [2, 3] . Atypical KD patients, who are often younger than 1 year, usually have an incorrect initial diagnosis because they exhibit few early signs of KD. Atypical KD is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery abnormalities. KD-related morbidity and mortality rates are high in this patient group [2, 3] . Therefore, KD should be kept in mind in the diVerential diagnosis of every child with fever of unknown origin, especially in children younger than 1 year. Our patient presented with four clinical criteria of KD (fever, conjunctivitis, oral mucosal changes, and rash) and coronary artery dilatation. Atypical KD was considered as the result of clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic Wndings.",

It has been suggested that 75% of primary CMV infections in pediatric patients occur during the Wrst year of life [7] . Recent studies have implicated CMV in the development of some vascular diseases including atherosclerosis and vasculitis in children and adults [8] [9] [10] . In an experimental study by Rachel, mice were infected intraperitoneally with CMV and cytomegalic inclusion bodies were seen within cells in the aortic media; CMV antigens were detected in the aVected aortas immunohistochemistry. They concluded that CMV might be a cause of aortic inXammation in mice, and that great vessels are the possible targets for CMV [11] . Meyer et al. [5] have described a patient with an active CMV infection and systemic necrotizing vasculitis. After a biopsy Wnding of a necrotizing vasculitis, they detected positive serologic tests (i.e., CMV IgM, IgG) and CMV-DNA in the sputum by PCR. Ganciclovir and CMV immunoglobulin had been added to the treatment regimen along with prednisolone. Two weeks later, CMV-DNA was negative in the sputum by PCR and CRP; ESR had normalized [5] . In other case reports, it has also been demonstrated that CMV may infect vascular endothelial cells, causing local vasculitis of a leukocytoclastic or necrotizing form with Wbrinoid necrosis [12, 13] . Aortic arch thrombosis has been deWned in a newborn with congenital CMV infection by Lanari et al. [9] . These authors proved CMV infection by means of virus isolation in cell cultures and at the same time, the viral genome was detected in the blood by PCR [9] .",
