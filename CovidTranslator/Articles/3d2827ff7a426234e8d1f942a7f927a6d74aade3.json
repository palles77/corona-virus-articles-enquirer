An estimated 3900 million people in 128 countries are at risk for dengue infection. 2 The incidence and geographical distribution of dengue have greatly increased in recent years. Currently, it is estimated that 390 million dengue infections occur each year, with about 100 million manifesting clinically with varying degrees of severity of the disease 3 ; a small proportion progress to severe dengue. With the growing incidence of severe dengue epidemics since the 1970s, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported cases across the Americas, South-East Asia, and the Western Pacific exceeding 1.2 million in 2008 and more than 3 million in 2013, based on official data submitted by member states. 4 These numbers continue to increase: 2.35 million cases of dengue were reported in the Americas alone in 2013; of this number, 37,687 were cases of severe dengue. 4 The dengue virus is carried and spread by species of mosquitoes in the genus Aedes. Of these species, the primary vector is Aedes aegypti. Other Aedes species that transmit dengue include Aedes albopictus, Aedes polynesiensis, and Aedes scutellaris.",

In that year, 93% of American missionaries returning from Jamaica showed serologic evidence of recent or past infection with the Dengue Virus. 5 The Dengue Virus-1 serotype was first reported in the Americas region in 1977 after an outbreak that began in Jamaica and expanded to Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela and eventually to the rest of the Caribbean countries, Mexico, Central America, and the northern countries of South America. 6 A study conducted in Jamaica in 2009 found the seroprevalence of dengue immunoglobulin (Ig)G and dengue IgM antibodies to be 100% and 3.6%, respectively. 7 The high seroprevalence of dengue IgG antibodies suggests that the Jamaican population might be at increased risk for dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. It was recently reported that in a 2007e2008 epidemic of dengue in Jamaica, 3165 tested sera showed seropositivity for dengue, leptospirosis, and malaria at rates of 38.4%, 6%, and 6.5%, respectively. 8 This highlights the presence of 3 concurrent epidemics with dengue seroprevalence being the highest in the country. Between January and December 2012, the Jamaican Ministry of Health recorded 5384 clinically suspected cases of dengue fever, with 732 laboratoryconfirmed cases and 10 confirmed dengue-related deaths. 9 The Jamaican Ministry of Health has been working tirelessly to prevent dengue outbreaks and fatalities through the implementation of control interventions. [9] [10] [11] As with many community health problems, the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) of the population play a major role in implementation of control measures. However, little is known of the KAPs of Jamaicans in the control and prevention of vector-borne diseases (VBDs). Although the WHO declared Jamaica free of malaria in 1965, 12 between November 6, 2006 and February 3, 2007, the Jamaican Ministry of Health confirmed 280 cases of malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum on the island. 13 This outbreak was brought under control in September 2007. 14 In light of the recent outbreak of the Chikungunya virus leading to a declaration of a \"national emergency\" in Jamaica, it is very important now, more than ever, to assess and address matters that are imperative to preventing future VBD outbreaks and epidemics in the country. 15 The goal of this study was to assess KAPs of selected communities in western Jamaica regarding control of VBDs such as dengue and malaria.",

Participation was strictly voluntary and no incentives were provided. The Institutional Review Board of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the Advisory Panel on Ethics and Medico-Legal Affairs in the Ministry of Health, Jamaica, and the WRHA of Jamaica approved the study protocol before its implementation. Study Instrument and Data Collection. Data were collected from each participant using a pretested questionnaire administered by a study interviewer. The questionnaire addressed the following areas: sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, marital status, education, employment status, occupation, income, and number of people in household), knowledge of and experience with VBDs, attitude toward VBDs, and practices of VBD control. Data Analysis. Characteristics of the study population are presented as means, SDs, ranges, and frequency tabulations. Each participant was assigned a separate score for knowledge, attitude, and practice based on the number of correct or appropriate responses. Each appropriate answer was assigned 1 point (incorrect responses were assigned zero points). The knowledge scale ranged from 0 to 17 points, the attitude scale from 0 to 6 points, and the practice scale from 0 to 10 points. The scores were further dichotomized into low (poor) or high (good) as follows: knowledge (low \u00bc 0e7 points; high \u00bc 8e17 points); attitude (low \u00bc 0e3 points; high \u00bc 4e6 points); practice (low \u00bc 0e5 points, high \u00bc 6e10 points). Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate crude and adjusted odds ratios as well as corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Each variable was first entered separately into bivariate logistic regression models to evaluate the crude association with sociodemographic characteristics. All predictors were then entered in multivariable logistic regression to get adjusted odds ratios. Bivariate and multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of practice score. Data were analyzed using the JMP Statistical software.",

            "text": "Control. Almost all of the study participants reported they had heard of dengue fever (97.5%) and malaria (95%; Table 2 ). However, only 11 (3%) reported a history of dengue fever, and 2 (0.6%) reported a history of malaria. Six percent reported having a family member or friend who had had dengue, and 3.3% reported having a family member or friend with a history of malaria. When asked about the mode of transmission of dengue fever, 45% of respondents correctly identified \"mosquitoes\" as the vectors of transmission. However, only 7.8% were able to identify the A aegypti mosquito as the vector for the disease. With regard to malaria, only 39% of study participants knew that the infection was transmitted by mosquitoes, and only 4% could correctly identify the Anopheles sp. mosquito as the main vector for malaria. With respect to vector biting times, only 2.5% of participants knew the biting time of A aegypti to be during the day. However, 86% of participants correctly identified the biting period of the malaria vector to be at night. Only 16% of respondents reported taking any measures to prevent dengue fever, and 12% reported taking measures to avoid malaria. Of the 11 participants who reported a history of dengue fever, 6 said they sought medical attention for the infection. Two participants with a history of malaria both reported seeking medical attention for the disease. Attitudes Toward VBDs. Almost 70% of the participants agreed that malaria is a serious disease, whereas only 47% thought that dengue was a serious illness (Table 3) . When the participants were asked what their course of action would be if they noticed they had symptoms of malaria or dengue fever, at least 94% said they would consult a physician. When asked if it were possible to get rid of mosquitoes in their communities, 69% said that it was. Although 55% of the participants responded that both the government and the community are responsible for mosquito management and keeping the environment safe, approximately 20% of the participants said that the government was solely responsible to take measures to prevent the disease and its transmission; 23% of participants believed it was their personal responsibility. Practices Regarding Vector Control. Table 4 shows practices regarding vector control in the study population. Sixty-five percent of respondents reported that they keep drinking water containers in and around their household, and 96% of those reported that they cover these containers. Approximately 57% of participants reported emptying their drinking containers regularly, whereas the other 43% reported rarely (not every week) or never emptying their drinking water storage containers. About 52% of participants reported having other water storage containers, and only 39% of those reported covering them. Also, 39% reported emptying other water containers at least every week. In addition to water containers, 12% of the respondents reported having flower pots or vases, and about 49% reported emptying the water in flower pots or vases at least every week. Approximately 20% of participants reported having containers containing or having the potential to hold water (eg, old car tires, stagnant or empty tins and cans, etc.) in and around the household. Although 79% reported that a garbage collection truck served their community, they expressed dissatisfaction with the schedule and consistency of garbage collection. A large proportion of the respondents (80%) reported not having mosquito screen/mesh on the windows of their household, and approximately 69% reported not having mosquito nets. When asked about mosquito net use, 41% of those with nets (13% of the total population) reported sleeping under mosquito nets during the day, and 81% of those with nets (25% of the total population) reported using mosquito nets at night. Regarding the use of mosquito coils and repellants by the respondents, only 16% reported using mosquito coils during the day, whereas 52% use coils during the night. A similar percentage (16%) reported using mosquito repellants during the day, but unlike the use of coils, only 38% used repellants at night.",
