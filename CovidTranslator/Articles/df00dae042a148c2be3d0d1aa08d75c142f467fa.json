The heterogeneous nature of the clinical manifestations and therapeutic responses of asthma in both adult and pediatric patients indicate that it may be more of a syndrome rather than a specific disease entity. Numerous triggering factors including viral infections, allergen and irritant exposure, and exercise, among others, complicate both the acute and chronic treatment of asthma. Therapeutic intervention has focused on the appreciation that airway obstruction in asthma is composed of both bronchial smooth muscle spasm and variable degrees of airway inflammation characterized by edema, mucus secretion, and the influx of a variety of inflammatory cells. The presence of only partial reversibility of airflow obstruction in some patients indicates that structural remodeling of the airways may also occur over time. Choosing appropriate medications depends on the disease severity (intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, severe persistent), extent of reversibility, both acutely and chronically, patterns of disease activity (exacerbations related to viruses, allergens, exercise, etc), and the age of onset (infancy, childhood, adulthood).

Bronchial smooth muscle spasm probably is instrumental in this excessive reactivity, but there are many factors in the airway that regulate or contribute to airway smooth muscle tone. For example, the airway contains a number of resident cells (mast cells, alveolar macrophages, airway epithelium and endothelium) as well as immigrating inflammatory cells (eosinophils, lymphocytes, neutrophils, basophils, and, possibly, platelets). These cells are capable of secreting a variety of mediators, such as histamine, the cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC 4 , LTD 4 , and LTE 4 ), prostaglandin D 2 , and platelet-activating factor, which can directly contract the bronchial smooth muscle. In addition, the recruited cells can generate inflammatory mediators, which cause the airway smooth muscle to become more contractible to bronchospasm mediators.",

Nonetheless, the process appears to be under the control of mediators quite distinct from those involved in the acute inflammatory response. For example, in remodeling, the generation and presence of growth factors appear more critical and lead to the above structural changes in the airway tissue. Thus, the shift or transition to remodeling from allergic inflammation suggests a new family of mediators with actions on smooth muscle growth, collagen deposition, blood vessel proliferation, and mucous gland hyperplasia. Collectively, these new data provide a picture of asthma that begins with an acute cellular inflammatory response that may then evolve into a more chronic process in which structural changes occur in the airway to further affect airway hyperresponsiveness and airflow obstruction. 7",

Airway hyperresponsiveness, if demonstrable during infancy and early childhood, may be a risk factor for the subsequent development of clinical asthma. 9 Although airway inflammation contributes to this physiologic aberration in asthma, multiple other factors that influence airway caliber play a role as well. 10 It is important to emphasize that airway hyperresponsiveness is not unique to asthma. A positive methacholine challenge test is diagnostic for airway hyperresponsiveness (which can be seen in atopics, patients with cystic fibrosis, and other chronic lung diseases and even in normal individuals for a few weeks after a viral respiratory tract infection), not asthma per se. The potential usefulness of this test is if it is negative (eg, in the evaluation of chronic cough), since it is unusual for a patient with clinical asthma to have a level of airway responsiveness that would fall into the normal range.",

Thus, a patient with ongoing symptoms of moderate persistent asthma, despite receiving the appropriate maintenance treatment for this step (Figs 2 and 3), should be regarded as having moderate persistent asthma.

            "text": "Allergens. Allergen exposure is important in host allergic sensitization and as a common precipitant of asthmatic symptoms in both children and adults. The development of allergic disease involves first, the process of sensitization [allergen-specific IgE antibody formation in a genetically predisposed (atopic) individual], and second, the expression and targeting of this response to various organ systems (eg, nose, skin, lung, and so forth). In asthma, the target organ is obviously the lung, but immunoinflammatory events in the upper airway may contribute to loss of asthma control as well. 16 The formation of antigen-specific IgE antibody to aeroallergens (eg, mites, trees, grasses, animal dander) does not usually occur until 2 to 3 years of life. Thus, aeroallergen-induced asthma is uncommon during the first year of life but begins to increase in prevalence during later childhood and adolescence and peaks in the second decade of life. Once established in genetically predisposed individuals, IgE-mediated reactions are a major contributor both to acute asthmatic symptoms and chronic airway inflammation. Chronic low-level exposure to indoor allergens and dust mite and cockroach in particular may play a major role in both asthma pathogenesis and subsequent provocation of symptoms. 17 Although a wide variety of inhaled allergens can provoke asthma symptoms, sensitization to house dust mite, 18 cockroach, 19 Alternaria, 20 and, possibly, cat 21 are important in the pathogenesis of asthma. Paradoxically, recent data would suggest that exposure to cats or dogs during early life may actually protect against the development of asthma. 22 The features of these allergens to the development of asthma are not fully established but may relate to their enzymatic as well as antigenic activity. 23 Alternaria exposure, in particular, may produce severe acute asthmatic symptoms, as sensitivity to Alternaria has been implicated as a risk factor for sudden respiratory arrest in adolescents and young adults with asthma. 24 Although food allergy may produce bronchospasm along with skin and/or gastrointestinal symptoms, it is very unusual for food allergy to produce an isolated respiratory reaction. 25 Infections. Respiratory tract infections caused by viruses, 26, 27 Chlamydia, [28] [29] [30] and Mycoplasma 31 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma. Of these respiratory pathogens, viruses have been demonstrated to be associated with asthma in at least three ways. First, during infancy, certain viruses have been implicated as potentially being responsible for the inception of the asthmatic phenotype. The virus most convincingly demonstrated in this regard has been respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). 11, 32 However, since nearly every child has been infected at least once with this virus by 2 years of age, additional genetic, environmental, or developmental factors must contribute to the propensity of this particular virus to be linked with childhood asthma. 33, 34 Second, in patients with established asthma, particularly children, viral upper respiratory tract infections play a significant role in producing acute exacerbations of airway obstruction that may result in frequent outpatient visits or in hospitalizations. 26, [35] [36] [37] Rhinovirus, the common cold virus, is the most frequent cause of exacerbations, but other viruses including parainfluenza, RSV, influenza, and coronavirus also have been implicated, albeit to a lesser extent. The increased tendency for viral infections to produce lower airway symptoms in asthmatic individuals may be related, at least in part, to interactions among allergic sensitization, allergen exposure, and viral infections acting as cofactors in the induction of acute episodes of airflow obstruction. 38, 39 Third, and paradoxically, infections have been considered to have the potential of actually preventing the development of allergic respiratory tract diseases, including asthma. Interest in this area increased after the advancement of the \"hygiene hypothesis,\" 40 which proposed that increasing family size coincident with an increased number of infections may protect against these developments. On the basis of a progressively broader interpretation of this initial hypothesis, a number of other epidemiologic and biological factors have been evaluated regarding their ability to influence the development of allergic sensitization and/or asthma. 40 Stepwise approach for treating infants and young children (5 years of age and younger) with acute or chronic asthma (reproduced from http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma/asthsumm.htm).",

Bronchodilation is the initial response to exercise, which occurs in both normal individuals and subjects with asthma, and may be mediated by the release of catecholamines. This response is transient, peaks midexercise, and returns to baseline at the end of exercise. Progressive bronchospasm then ensues, with maximal obstruction occurring 5 to 10 minutes after the cessation of exercise. Spontaneous remission usually follows, such that pulmonary function returns to baseline within 30 to 60 minutes. Under most circumstances, the degree of bronchoconstriction is rarely severe enough to be life-threatening, and such a situation almost invariably reflects advanced untreated disease or confounding triggering factors (ie, concomitant allergen or irritant exposure), or both. EIB is more apt to occur after short (4 to 10 minutes) periods of intense exercise, although obstruction has been shown to occur after exercise durations up to 30 minutes. Some individuals with EIB are capable of \"running through\" their symptoms. That is, despite continued exercise in the presence of acute asthma, gradual spontaneous resolution of bronchospasm occurs, giving these subjects a \"second wind.\"",

Approximately 5% to 10% of asthmatic patients will have an acute worsening of symptoms to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 45 The aspirin triad, asthma, nasal polyps, and aspirin sensitivity, is usually found in adult asthmatic patients. The response to aspirin, or other NSAIDs, begins within 1 hour of aspirin ingestion and is associated with profound rhinorrhea, eye lacrimation, and, potentially, severe bronchospasm. Patients sensitive to aspirin usually are reactive to all other NSAIDs, and variations in the fre-quency and severity of adverse responses appear to depend on the potency of each drug within this class of compounds to inhibit the activity of the cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-1 enzyme. The use of COX-2 inhibitors in aspirinsensitive patients is usually not a problem in the majority of patients 46 ; rofecoxib has recently been shown to have an excellent safety profile in this regard. 47 The sensitivity to NSAIDs is not IgE-mediated but involves the modulation of eicosanoid production. It has been suggested that NSAIDs act by reducing the formation of prostaglandins that help maintain normal airway function while increasing the formation of asthma-provoking eicosanoids, including hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids and large quantities of cysteinyl leukotrienes. 45 In addition, there is evidence that mast cell activation occurs and its mediators can be detected in nasal secretions during an episode of aspirin-induced asthma. 48 A precise phenotype for patients at risk for aspirininduced responses has yet to be fully described, but overexpression of leukotriene C 4 synthase has been associated with this syndrome. 49 However, this syndrome should be of concern in any asthmatic patient with nasal polyposis, chronic sinusitis, and eosinophilia, although the polyposis and sinusitis may precede the onset of recognized NSAID sensitivity by years.",

However, it has been estimated that as many as 45% to 65% of adults and children with asthma have GERD. The mechanisms by which GERD affects asthma are also not established but may include microaspiration or irritation of the esophagus with reflex bronchospasm. Although often asymptomatic in its presentation, many patients have nighttime exacerbations or difficult-to-control symptoms. Confirmation of the importance of GERD to asthma often requires endoscopy and 24-hour monitoring of intraesophageal pH levels with concomitant measures of peak expiratory flow rates. Recognition of this factor in asthma severity is important since effective therapy is currently available. 50 Psychosocial factors. The role of psychosocial factors, or \"stress,\" has undergone an important reevaluation both in terms of a disease risk factor and a concomitant component of severity. In addition to patient stress acting in an autocrine fashion, recent evidence has shown that parental stress is a risk factor for asthma expression in some children. The mechanisms by which this occurs have not been defined but may include the promotion of allergic inflammation. 51",

Although hyperresponsiveness is not diagnostic of asthma, its absence is a strong indication that the condition under evaluation is unlikely to be asthma. Airway hyperresponsiveness can be identified and quantified in pulmonary testing facilities by using bronchial challenge or provocation tech-niques, which are helpful in establishing the presence of asthma when baseline lung functions are normal and the diagnosis is in question. The most commonly employed methods used to evaluate airway hyperresponsiveness include inhalation provocation with methacholine (direct stimuli) and exercise challenge (indirect stimuli). Direct stimuli act upon the relevant receptors on bronchial smooth muscle stimulating airway muscle contraction directly. Indirect stimuli result in airway smooth muscle contraction through one or more intermediate mechanisms, including local or central neuronal reflexes, activation of resident (eg, mast cells through non-IgEdependent mediator release) or inflammatory cells, or others. 8 Bronchoprovocation studies with methacholine are more sensitive but less specific than is exercise challenge for diagnosing asthma. In addition, indirect airway responsiveness correlates better with asthma severity, asthma symptoms, and airway inflammation. 8 To perform methacholine bronchoprovocation, changes in pulmonary function (ie, fall in FEV 1 ) are measured with serial spirometry after the patient inhales incremental doses of methacholine. People with asthma respond to bronchoprovocation with greater degrees of airflow obstruction than do normal subjects. The concentration at which patients respond, that is, provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV 1 (PC 20 ), defines the level of bronchial responsiveness. Bronchial provocation can be helpful in the differential diagnosis of asthma when the history, physical findings, and baseline lung functions are not adequate to confirm the clinical diagnosis of asthma, that is, cough variant asthma and the evaluation of exercise-induced dyspnea.",

[68] [69] [70] [71] [72] Based on these conflicting opinions, consensus recommendations regarding its use as a substitute for racemic albuterol will not be possible until further studies can address these controversial issues.",

Theophylline, a methylxanthine, is a bronchodilator medication that may have mild antiinflammatory effects as well. 73 Sustained-release theophylline preparations and aminophylline can be used as controller medications in asthma in both children and adults. 74, 75 Due to its low cost, it is used in many countries to treat mild disease. Although, it can be used as an add-on therapy to low or high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids when further asthma control is needed, it is less effective in this capacity than the addition of a long acting \u03b2 2 -agonist. 76 Serum levels of theophylline, due to liver metabolism, may be markedly affected by a number of variables including age, diet, disease states, and drug interactions, all of which contribute to the complexity of using this medication. 73 In addition, theophylline may produce a number of dose-related side effects. Gastrointestinal symptoms may be intolerable to some patients, even well within the usual therapeutic drug levels. For children taking theophylline, a concern to parents and teachers is the suggestion that theophylline might adversely affect school performance, although many studies have not been able to substantiate this association. 73 Nonetheless, avoiding prescribing theophylline to children with preexisting behavior and/or school difficulties seems reasonable.",

Cromolyn sodium and nedocromil sodium are two structurally different antiinflammatory medications for the treatment of chronic asthma that have similar properties. They are rapidly absorbed from the lungs and are impressively safe. Both medications are not bronchodilators but have been shown to inhibit inflammatory cell activation and mediator release, early and late allergen-induced bronchoconstriction, and reduce airway hyperresponsiveness. 77, 78 The mechanism of action of these agents may be related to their effects on airway epithelial chloride channels 79 or their effects on local neuronal reflexes. Cromolyn has been shown to be effective in both adult 80 and pediatric patients. 81 Both can be modestly effective prophylactically in the attenuation of exercise-induced bronchospasm, 82 albeit less so than \u03b2 2 -agonists. Both agents may be useful for prophylaxis before relevant allergen exposure in sensitized patients. For long-term treatment of persistent asthma in children, treatment with ICS has been shown to be superior to nedocromil in achieving overall asthma control. 83 Leukotriene antagonists. Leukotrienes are biologically active fatty acids derived from the oxidative metabolism of arachidonic acid, an integral part of the cell membrane. The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC 4 , LTD 4 , and LTE 4 ) can be generated by eosinophils, mast cells and alveolar macrophages and combine with specific receptors, CysLT 1 and CysLT 2 . The majority of actions of cysteinyl leukotrienes are generated by interaction with the CysLT 1 receptor which can lead to airway smooth muscle contraction, leukocyte chemotaxis, and increases in vascular permeability. The actions of leukotrienes can be prevented by inhibition of cysteinyl leukotriene synthesis [5-lipoxygenase inhibitors (zileuton)] or antagonists or leukotriene receptors (zafirlukast and montelukast). Of these compounds, the receptor antagonists are now most frequently used in asthma treatment. 84, 85 The receptor antagonists have been shown to inhibit exercise-provoked bronchospasm, to modify the airway response to inhaled antigens, and to improve airway function in patients with chronic asthma. In adult patients with asthma, leukotriene receptor antagonists can improve airflow obstruction between 8% and 13%, reduce the need for \u03b2-agonists, and reduce asthma exacerbations. In head-to-head trials with inhaled corticosteroids, the leukotriene receptor antagonists are less effective in terms of improvement in lung function and reduction in exacerbations. However, when added to a baseline dose of inhaled corticosteroids, this class of compounds has the potential of improving overall asthma control. The convenience of once-per-day oral dosing (montelukast) and safety has been an appeal for some patients. With increasing experience in clinical response profiles and pharmacogenetic variability, more precise recommendations on prescribing priority and placement should be possible.",

Glucocorticoids produce their effect on various cells by binding to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors (GR), which go on to regulate transcription of certain target genes.

First, to gain control of the underlying disease process, or to achieve a state of disease remission (eg, in status asthmaticus, or in patients with chronic stable asthma who have had significant diminutions in lung function over more prolonged time periods). Second, to maintain this control (remission) for as long as possible with the least amount of side effects. These initial actions usually require high-dose ICS or, more frequently, systemic corticosteroids. Remittive therapy usually requires an oral corticosteroid burst [eg, 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg per day prednisone for 5 days (usual adult maximum is 40 to 60 mg/d)]. The duration of the burst will vary considerably among patients, but the goal should be to maximize lung function, minimize symptoms, and reduce the use of rescue medications. At the same time, an ICS medication should be started at doses sufficient to maintain the initial remission for prolonged periods of time. The dose and type of medication may be influenced by age (delivery systems, side effects), cost, and the familiarity of the clinician with the nuances of the various available products. It should be emphasized that the abrupt discontinuation of ICS is an important cause of asthma exacerbations.",

Of historic importance are the severity of symptoms, current medications (including recent corticosteroid use), onset of symptoms, and prior hospitalization or emergency department visits. In addition to a physical examination to determine vital signs and auscultation of the chest for breath sounds/wheezing or \"silent chest,\" careful attention should be directed toward alertness, cyanosis, and use of accessory muscles of respiration (retractions or abdominal breathing in children). Collectively, these features can provide objective insight into the level of asthma severity. Assessment of lung function by using peak flow meters or spirometry (FEV 1 and FVC) is essential to most precisely determine the baseline level of airflow obstruction and the ultimate response to therapy. With severe airflow obstruction (FEV 1 <40%) or a history of severe respiratory compromise, an arterial blood gas value can assess oxygenation and carbon dioxide concentrations as an indicator of impending respiratory failure.",

A combination of \u03b2 2 -agonists and ipratropium bromide (anticholinergic agent) may produce better bronchodilation than either drug alone and is associated with lower hospitalization rates in both adult and pediatric patients. 92 The efficacy of intravenous aminophylline in acute severe asthma has been evaluated, and the accumulated evidence in the majority of patients does not support its routine use in this setting because of its high risk/benefit ratio. 93 Treatment with glucocorticosteroids (inhaled, oral, and/or parenteral) is the mainstay of treatment for asthma exacerbations. From the variety of approaches that have been evaluated for the treatment of exacerbations ranging from mild to severe, the overall results indicate the importance of treating each patient individually based on their prior pattern of therapeutic response and/or the nature and severity of the current clinical presentation that is being addressed. For home treatment of mild exacerbations, increasing doses of baseline ICS or intermittent intervention with high doses of ICS may be efficacious in averting the progression of symptoms, particularly in children. 94 In patients in the emergency department, treatment of both children and adults with high doses of ICS who are not currently receiving corticosteroid therapy may reduce the risk of subsequent hospitalization. 95 For more moderate to severe exacerbations, systemic corticosteroids are usually required because they enhance the speed of resolution of symptoms and significantly improve a variety of outcome measures. They should be considered integral to the treatment of these episodes, especially if:",

These various compounds can induce localized inflammatory cell influx and activation through the upregulation of various chemokines and adhesion molecules and recruitment of bone marrow cells (eg, eosinophils).
