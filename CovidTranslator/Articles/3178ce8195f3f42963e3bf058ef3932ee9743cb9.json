The purified C. montana lectin was a homodimer of 11,968.9 Da subunits as determined by gel filtration and MS. The hemagglutinating activity of CML was inhibited by branched oligomannosides. The N-terminal 15-amino acid sequence of CML, DNVKYSGQVKNTGSA, has not been reported for other lectins. Also, the peptide mass fingerprinting assay confirmed that there is no match result of similar plant lectins for CML, indicating CML may be a novel plant lectin. CML showed marked antiviral activity against various viruses in cell culture. Subsequently, CML was also found to exhibit remarkable inhibitory effect on L929, HeLa, MCF7 and HepG2 cells. Furthermore, CML specially induced L929 cell apoptosis in dose-dependent manner as evidenced by MTT, fluorescent microscopy, LDH activity-based cytotoxicity assays and DNA ladder. Moreover, due to both caspase inhibitors and Western blot analyses, caspase was also found to play the important role in the potential apoptotic mechanism of CML. When the carbohydrate-binding site was fully inhibited by sugars, cytotoxicity was abruptly decreased and apoptotic phenomenon in L929 cells was not observed, suggesting a significant correlation between mannose-binding-specific activity and the antineoplastic mechanism.",

It has been reported previously that an N-acetylgalactosaminespecific lectin was purified from winter aconite (Eranthis hyemalis), a representative of the plant family Ranunculaceae. This lectin has been considered to be the first lectin isolated from the family Ranunculaceae [8] . In this study, we purified and characterized a novel mannose-binding lectin from the stem of C. Montana, which belongs to the plant family Ranunculaceae as well. Subsequently, C. montana lectin (CML) was found to bear remarkable antiviral activities in vitro against a variety of DNA and RNA viruses in cell culture. Furthermore, we showed that this lectin possessed the potent anti-tumor activity by direct cytotoxicity in four typical cancer cells and then found apoptosis in L929 cells. More importantly, we further explored that caspase played a crucial role in the potential mechanism of apoptosis. Moreover, through the sugar-inhibitory analysis, a significant correlation was discovered between the sugar-binding specificity of CML and the apoptosis-inducing mechanism. As mentioned above, these results would provide more insightful clues for understanding the key role of this lectin in further cancer investigations.",

However, the yield of lectins from the plant seeds was reportedly in the ranges 9.5-66% [39, 22] . In addition, another similar yield has been reported that the lectin from jasmonic acid treated tobacco leaves is approximately 30 mg lectin per kilogram fresh leaves [24] , which indicated that the content of CML is quite low.",

Yeast mannan, containing oligomannosidic-type glycans with a (1,2) and a (1,3) terminal non-reducing mannosyl residues [49] , and Mana(1,3:1,6)-mannotriose were the most effective inhibitors for hemagglutination activity of this lectin. Nevertheless, the agglutination was not inhibited by D-mannose, a-methyl-mannoside and 2-deoxy-D-Man. These results indicated that CML only recognized oligosaccharidic sequences containing branched oligomannosides. It demonstrated that this lectin possesses an extended carbohydrate-binding site, which can accommodate highly branched oligomannosides. This phenomenon has been observed in monocot mannose-binding lectins, such as H. tuberosus and A. constricta lectins [49, 16] .",

CML also showed marked antiviral activity against various viruses in cell cultures like some other aforementioned mannose-binding lectins. However, CML exhibited no sequence similarity with other known lectins, especially all the previously reported mannose-binding lectins according to the results of N-terminal homology searching, MALDI-Q-TOF MS/MS analysis and database search. Thus, CML might be a novel mannose-binding plant lectin, which has not been reported in any lectin family. However, only the N-terminal homology searching by BLASTp method from NCBI and manually data mining, and further by peptide mass fingerprintings analysis are not remarkable enough to prove conclusively that CML is a completely novel lectin. Furthermore, this lectin may also possess more unknown significant biological activities to further explore our following investigations of CML. So, future studies will be aimed at the molecular cloning and sequence analysis of CML. And based on the cloning results, more information will be obtained and the classification of this lectin would be further clearly defined.",

A great number of studies have reported that some 'ideal' anti-cancer candidate drugs can induce apoptosis in susceptible cancer cells [37] . Like these anti-cancer drugs, CML executed dose-dependent growthinhibitory effect on four typical cancer cells. Based upon the morphologic observation, it was found that CML-induced L929 cell apoptosis; moreover, by MTT assay, it also indicated that CML is active in exerting cytotoxicity against L929 cells.

Subsequently, caspase-8 activated caspase-3 whose substrates were PARP and ICAD. The ICAD is a caspase substrate that is cleaved to be inactivated and allow CAD to execute the characteristic fragmentation of DNA. Thus, the ICAD expression in L929 cells was examined to confirm the activation of caspase-3. The roles of caspase-8 and caspase-3 are not only substantiated to be associated with participation of caspase inhibitors, but also seems to be restricted to apoptosis mediated by upstream death receptor pathway or mitochondrial pathway [6, 45] . Consequently, based upon the observations reported, we suggested that the above-mentioned two major pathways are likely existing in apoptosis induced by CML. Further investigation of these possible mechanisms would clearly affect the outcomes of this lectin, including a wide variety of agents currently used in cancer treatment and pharmaceutical application [31, 33] .",

In the current study, we found a typical caspase-dependent apoptosis through participation of three caspase inhibitors and Western blot analysis. The distinction of their antineoplastic mechanisms might be due to CML-induced procaspase-8, procaspase-3 cleaving and ICAD, PARP expressing. The cells were treated with 1 pM CML for the indicated time periods followed by Western blot analysis for detecting procaspase-8, procaspase-3, ICAD and PARP expressions. b-Actin was used as an equal loading control. the fine differences of their carbohydrate-binding sites. In our study, it indicated that the anti-tumor activity decreased abruptly and the phenomenon of apoptosis almost disappeared when the carbohydrate-binding site was fully inhibited. Thus, the CML binding might be the predominant reason which sparks off the significant anti-tumor biological characteristics, even casting a crucial impact on its potential apoptotic mechanism. In recent years, some research has reported the PCL-induced apoptosis in A375 cells [27, 28] and comparisons of the antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing activities among PCL, OJL and LNL in MCF-7 cells [31] . In addition, other major lectin families, such as RIPs II, have also been reported to induce apoptosis in various cancer cells for several years [26] . These results indicate that the various lectin families-induced apoptotic mechanism is a caspase-dependent pathway and would provide more clues for further elucidating their anti-tumor activity and mechanisms in lectin studies. Accordingly, this interesting finding would drive us a principal force to further explore the significant correlation between the carbohydrate-binding-specificity and the antineoplastic molecular mechanism.",
