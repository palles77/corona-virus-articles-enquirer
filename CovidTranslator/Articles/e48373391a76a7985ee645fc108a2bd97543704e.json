Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) have been widely used in clinical practice to diagnose influenza because they are easy to use and provide results within 10-15 minutes (CDC, 2013; Cho et al., 2013) .

Using stored samples, it displayed a sensitivity of 82.2% for influenza A, compared to real-time RT-PCR; however, the mean age of the study population was younger (21.3 years old) than ours (Lee et al., 2012) . In another prospective study, the sensitivity of Sofia\u2122 Influenza A + B FIA for the influenza A virus, compared to real-time RT-PCR, was 85% and 69% using nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs, respectively (Lewandrowski et al., 2013) . Although more than 90% of those patients were younger than 22 years old, this study showed a lower sensitivity for detection of influenza A using nasopharyngeal swab than our results (Lewandrowski et al., 2013) . However, direct comparison of the performance of RIDTs between these studies should be limited in interpretation because the clinical performance of RIDTs can be affected by multiple factors, some of which are uncontrollable. In our study, the sensitivities of both RIDTs for influenza A virus were higher in patients who visited the hospital within 2 days of symptom onset, compared to those who visited hospital 2 days after the symptom onset. This might be due to high viral titer during the early infection phase, and this finding is consistent with a previous study (Choi et al., 2011) . However, in a previous report, the sensitivity of RIDT was low during the very early period (within 3 hours of symptom onset) and the time interval from onset to consultation was shorter in RIDT false-negative group (5.5 hours) than in true-positive group (11.5 hours) (Harada et al., 2012) . Time from symptom onset to hospital visit was recorded in the unit of day in our study; thus, analysis based on hours was not available.",

            "text": "This study has some limitations. First, we used limited commercial RT-PCR kits as a gold standard. The sensitivities to detect influenza viruses vary with each commercial kit. Second, samples were used promptly for Sofia\u2122 Influenza A + B FIA after specimen collection. However, samples for PCR were eluted in 3 mL of VTM and were frozen at \u221270\u00b0C and used after thawing. There is a chance that influenza virus RNA was diluted in VTM. Freezing and thawing can reduce viral titer in clinical samples. These limitations can produce false negatives in PCR, causing false positives of the Sofia\u2122 Influenza A + B FIA in this study. Also, there is a chance that uneven distribution of influenza virus between 2 nasopharyngeal swabs could affect the results. Only adult patients were included in this study and relatively lower viral titer in adult than children could affect low sensitivity of RIDTs. However, viral titer was not determined. During the study period, influenza B virus rarely circulated; thus, we did not evaluate the performance of RIDTs for influenza B. In addition, direct comparison of sensitivity against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 between Sofia\u2122 Influenza A + B FIA and SD Bioline Influenza Ag A/B/A(H1N1/2009) is limited in interpretation. Because the Sofia\u2122 Influenza A + B FIA distinguishes influenza A and B, whereas the SD Bioline Influenza Ag A/B/A(H1N1/2009) has 3 lines to differentiate influenza A, B, and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.",

Due to its ability to provide relatively high sensitivity in the detection of the influenza A virus, it will be one of viable tools for the rapid diagnosis of influenza in clinical practice.",

Influenza vaccination (for the 2012-2013 season) rate was 44.2% (174/394). At least 1 of chronic underlying disease was detected in 111 patients (28.2%). Median time from symptom onset to sample collection was 1 day (IQR, 0-2) (Table 1). Among 394 specimens, 196 (49.7%) tested positive for influenza A virus by real-time RT-PCR. H3N2 influenza virus was the dominant strain (149/196, 76.0%) and A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was detected from 18.4% patients (36/196). Among 196 influenza A viruses, subtypes of 11 samples were not determined. Samples in which other respiratory viruses were detected accounted for 62. Sixty-eight respiratory viruses were detected in 62 samples: human metapneumovirus, 18; coronavirus, 18; human rhinovirus, 16; respiratory syncytial virus, 9; adenovirus, 5; parainfluenza virus, 1; bocavirus, 1. The performance of the Sofia\u2122 Influenza A + B FIA for the influenza A virus was estimated as follows: sensitivity 74.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67.3-80.0), specificity 95.4% (95% CI, 91.4-97.9), PPV 94.2% (95% CI, 89.2-97.3), and NPV 78.5% (95% CI, 72.7-83.5) (Table 2). The SD Bioline Influenza Ag A/B/A(H1N1/2009) showed sensitivity of 54.1% (95% CI, 46.8-61.2), specificity of 95.9% (95% CI, 92.1-98.2), PPV of 93.0% (95% CI, 86.6-96.9), and NPV of 67.5% (95% CI, 61.7-73.0).

The Sofia\u2122 Influenza A + B FIA showed sensitivity of 76.5% in patients aged 18-49 years and 68.8% in patients \u226550 years (P = 0.25). The sensitivity of SD Bioline Influenza Ag A/B/A(H1N1/ 2009) did not significantly differ according to age group (55.3% in 18-49 years and 51.6% in patients \u226550 years, P = 0.62).

For the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, the Sofia\u2122 Influenza A + B FIA showed a sensitivity of 91.7% (33/36; 95% CI, 77.5-98.2), a specificity of 95.4% (186/ 195; 95% CI. 91.4-97.9), a PPV of 78.6% (33/42; 95% CI, 63.2-89.7), and an NPV of 98.4% (186/189; 95% CI, 95.4-99.7).
