Human coronavirus sensitivity (HCVS) was expressed as a dominant phenotype in hybrids, indicating that mouse cells do not actively suppress 229E replication. HCVS segregated concordantly with the human chromosome 15 enzyme markers mannose phosphate isomerase (MPI) and the muscle form of pyruvate kinase (PKM2), and analysis of hybrids containing an ) (/15 translocation [t(X;15)(p11;q11)] localized HCVS to the qll ~ qter region of chromosome 15. HCVS might code for a specific surface receptor, allowing 229E to be absorbed to and received within the host cell.",

The somatic cell genetic approach has been a successful and currently necessary alternative to the use of animal hosts in studying the role of host genes in virus replication. One group of human viruses that are amenable to genetic analysis using somatic cell hybrids is the coronaviruses. Coronaviruses are enveloped, RNA-containing viruses causing a diverse group of diseases in man and other animals (6, 7) . In 83 0098-0366/82/0100-0083503.00/0 9 1982 Plenum Publishing Corporation man they are causative agents of a high proportion of respiratory illness and may be involved in diseases of other organs (6, 8, 9) . Relatively little is known about the genetic factors regulating infection caused by coronaviruses in their natural hosts. The prototype human coronavirus strain 229E provides a unique opportunity for investigating the genetics of susceptibility to coronavirus in vitro. 229E, as do most other coronaviruses, displays a narrow species-specific host range restriction, since it is capable of growing in a limited number of human cell types including cultured cells but not in rodent cells (6) (7) (8) . This property allows a genetic dissection of host range restriction and cellular susceptibility to 229E using man-mouse cell hybrids since the virus permissive state is usually dominant in cell hybrids.",

Correlation of susceptibility to infection with the presence of a specific chromosome in hybrids (1) (2) (3) 5) chromosomally assigns the gene. Using this strategy, the ability of 229E to form plaques on cell hybrids with different numbers and combinations of human chromosomes derived from several different human and mouse parental cells was determined. Our analysis indicates that the presence of the ql 1 ~ qter region of human chromosome 15 is required for susceptibility to this virus in vitro. The widespread occurrence of coronaviruses in the animal kingdom suggests that these viruses have evolved and diversified in parallel with the speciation of their respective animal hosts, more specifically, in parallel with a common host cell product necessary for virus infection. Based upon the known properties of 229E, we suggest that the product of HCVS might comprise part of a virus receptor, mediating entry of the virus into the cell.",

The remaining two hybrids did not survive under agar for the 7 days required for the plaque assay and were therefore examined by CPE assay. These hybrids were constructed from four different mouse cell lines (RAG, LM/TK-, LTP, and A9) and human parental cells from six unrelated individuals. Eighteen of the hybrids supported 229E plaque production and yielded dilution titers similar to those obtained when the same virus sample was titrated in parallel in WI-38 cells. 229E-sensitive and -insensitive hybrids derived from the different sets_ of parental cells. No plaques were observed in RAG, LM/TK-, or A9 cells exposed to comparable virus doses. These results indicate that sensitivity to 229E was transferred to these different mouse cell lines by fusion to several independently derived human parental cells obtained from the skin or lung. Analysis of the replication of viruses with narrow host range has often revealed a diminution in virus output from hybrids formed from permissive and nonpermissive cells. For example, polyoma virus replicates in mouse cells but not in hamster cells. In mouse-hamster hybrids, late events in the polyoma virus replication cycle are suppressed by increased numbers of hamster chromosomes even when these hybrids contain a diploid number of mouse chromosomes (26) . No suppressive effects of the mouse genome on 229E plaque production could be detected in hybrid cells using this qualitative assay. For example, the hybrid XTR-8 that contained all of the human chromosomes except the Y was as capable of supporting 229E plaque production as were parental WI-38 cells (Table 1 ). It appears here that sensitivity to 229E is a dominant phenotype in human-mouse hybrids.",

(Table 3) , and these data indicated that HCVS segregated with the qll --, qter portion of chromosome 15. This conclusion was based upon the following observations. Two series of hybrids, designated DUM and DUA, were constructed by fusing a human fibroblast strain containing an X/15 translocation (28) with RAG cells and A9 cells, respectively. HATsupplemented medium and 8-azaguanine could therefore be employed to select for and against (27) , respectively, the retention of the X/15 translocation. Of the 12 hybrids, seven were susceptible to 229E and contained an intact chromosome 15 and/or X/15 translocation. The five hybrid lines in this group that were not susceptible to 229E did not contain an intact chromosome 15. DUA-1 contained human chromosome 7 and the X/15 translocation but not an intact chromosome 15 and was sensitive to 229E (Table 3) . DUM-6 contained the X/15 translocation but not the intact 15 and was sensitive to 229E. Both DUM-6 and DUA-1 also contained the reciprocal 15/X translocation. However, it can be deduced that susceptibility to 229E segregates with the X/15 translocation (DUA-1A) and not with the 15/X reciprocal translocation (DUA-1 CSAZB). The independent secondary clones DUA-3 BSAG-A and DUA-5 BSAG-A, both counterselected in 8-azaguanine-supplemented medium, contained neither an intact chromosome 15 nor the X/15 translocation and both were not sensitive to 229E. The possible involvement of chromosomes X and 7 in determining the HCVS phenotype can be eliminated by the combined enzyme and karyotype data (Tables 2 and 3) . Thus, the results of karyotyping are consonant with the enzyme marker data and support the idea that a gene or genes on the ql 1 ---qter region of chromosome 15 regulate susceptibility to 229E.",

Our results demonstrate that a gene or genes in the ql 1 ~ qter region of human chromosome 15 determines susceptibility to 229E in human-mouse hybrids. The results of plaque assays indicate that HCVS is expressed as a dominant phenotype in hybrid cells and that the virus replicated in hybrids containing human chromosome 15 or X/15 in three different mouse \"genomic backgrounds\" (RAG, LTP, and A9). Thus, these parental mouse cell lines and, likely, rodent cell lines, in general, do not actively restrict 229E replication. We conclude accordingly that the human genome contributes products that render human-mouse hybrids susceptible to 229E.",

Susceptibility to polio virus in human-mouse hybrids is a dominant phenotype and is determined by a polio virus receptor gene on human chromosome 19 (1) . Nonpermissive mouse cells can support the replication of polio virus if exposed to infectious viral RNA, thus bypassing the requirement for virus receptors on the cell membrane involved in virus attachment (31) . In contrast, sensitivity to herpes virus type I is determined by a human gene product that acts at a postpenetration step (2, 5) . It is apparent that HCVS is not syntenic with previously described human genes on chromosomes 3, 6, 11, and 19 (1-5) whose products are involved in the replication of other RNA-and DNA-containing viruses. Moreover, HCVS is not syntenic with the known human genes on chromosomes 9 and 21, respectively, involved in either the production of or sensitivity to human interferons (32, 33) . It seems that genes exerting control over virus-host cell interactions are widely spaced in the human genome. The functional implications, if any, of such a distribution, however, are not clear.",

As with polio virus, another plus strand RNA virus, 229E genomic RNA would be infectious even for mouse cells that are naturally insusceptible to the virus. It is likely that 229E species-specific host restriction is determined by the presence of appropriate virus receptors on the cell membrane. The product of the HCVS gene might comprise part of a virus receptor. Mouse cells, lacking such receptors, would be naturally resistant to 229E, a situation analogous to and reminiscent of the polio virus system (1, 35) . Tissue-specific expression of virus receptors is thought to determine the organ tropism of polio virus in man (36) . A similar situation could account for coronavirus tissue tropism (37, 38) , in which the expression of virus receptors in various cell types might differ quantitatively or be regulated by the phenotypic state of the cell.",

The figures represent the titer of a given virus pool when assayed simultaneously in WI-38 and the indicated hybrid line. A zero indicates that no plaques were observed in the hybrid line. 229E grows to relatively low titers in human cells, and it was therefore necessary to use several different virus pools for screening all the hybrids. This accounts for the variation in titers observed after plaque assays. The human chromosome content of hybrids was determined by",
