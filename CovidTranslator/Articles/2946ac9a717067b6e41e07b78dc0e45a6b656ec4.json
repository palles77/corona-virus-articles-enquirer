Especially, the early mechanisms responsible for such immune hypo-responsiveness are unclear. Here, we show that TLR4 is the key immune sensing receptor to initiate paralysis of T-cell immunity after bacterial sepsis. Downstream of TLR4, signalling through TRIF but not MyD88 impaired the development of specific T-cell immunity against secondary infections. We identified type I interferon (IFN) released from splenic macrophages as the critical factor causing Tcell immune paralysis. Early during sepsis, type I IFN acted selectively on dendritic cells (DCs) by impairing antigen presentation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our results reveal a novel immune regulatory role for type I IFN in the initiation of septic immune paralysis, which is distinct from its well-known immune stimulatory effects. Moreover, we identify potential molecular targets for therapeutic intervention to overcome impairment of T-cell immunity after sepsis.",

            "text": "Sepsis is a severe inflammatory dysregulation arising during situations when infections are not confined locally but disseminate via the blood stream. The septic inflammatory response comprises two functionally distinct but not mutually exclusive phases: first, the systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) characterized by excessive production of pro-inflammatory mediators and second, the compensatory anti-inflammatory response (CARS). This later phase of sepsis is associated with increased susceptibility to secondary infections and is characterized by a severe impairment of adaptive T-cell immunity that subsequently can lead to an inability to control viral and bacterial infections, which may ultimately lead to multi-organ failure (Cohen, 2002; Hotchkiss and Karl, 2003; Hotchkiss et al, 2009 ). Various preclinical model systems have been developed to uncover pathophysiological cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for SIRS and CARS, such as caecum ligation and puncture, colon ascendens stent peritonitis (CASP), injection of bacteria or Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands such as LPS (Buras et al, 2005) . Using these model systems, it became clear that both SIRS and CARS are initiated by widespread activation of innate immune cells as a consequence of signalling through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs; Beutler, 2004; Kawai and Akira, 2010) . While SIRS is associated with massive secretion of MyD88 and TRIF-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., TNF, interferon (IFN)g, IL-1, IL-6; Weighardt et al, 2002; Weighardt and Holzmann, 2007) , CARS is linked to the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 (Volk et al, 2000; Cohen, 2002) , which is involved in dampening of innate and adaptive immune responses (Trinchieri, 2007; O'Garra and Murphy, 2009 ). IL-10 induces a refractory phase in macrophages that renders them non-responsive to PRR stimulation (Randow et al, 1995) and its serum levels correlate with decreased levels of MHC class II molecules and a defect in TNF production by monocytes of septic patients (Docke et al, 1997; Volk et al, 2000) . Consequently, impairment of adaptive CD8 \u00fe T cell (CTL) immunity is considered to depend on an IL-10-mediated impairment of macrophages to initiate T-cell immunity.",

We used a well-established murine sepsis model CASP to investigate the role of bacterial translocation into the circulation for septic immune paralysis by intragastric application of recombinant luciferase-expressing E. coli, which allowed us to directly visualize the rapid bacterial spread after surgical intervention into various organs by in-vivo bioluminescence imaging ( Figure  1A and B). Based on these results, we studied the mechanism determining immune regulation early during bacterial sepsis. To this end, we challenged mice surviving CASP with a systemic viral infection using recombinant adenovirus expressing Ovalbumin (AdOVA) and then determined the subsequent induction of OVA-specific T-cell immunity. We had shown recently that generation of adenovirus-induced CTL immunity strictly depends on antigen presentation by DCs in the spleen (Backer et al, 2010) and that systemic treatment of mice with the TLR-9-Ligand CpG-DNA resulted in inhibition of OVA-specific CTL immunity in the spleen (Wingender et al, 2006) . We, therefore, reasoned that systemic distribution of bacteria would impair local induction of antiviral CTL immunity in the spleen. Quantification of the OVA-specific CTL response 5 days after AdOVA infection by measuring specific T-cell cytotoxicity in vivo revealed that antiviral CTL immunity was strongly suppressed in mice after CASP compared with untreated mice ( Figure 1C ). Further supporting our hypothesis that systemic bacteria suppress CTL responses in the spleen, mock-treated mice that had undergone only laparatomy and mechanical intestinal manipulation, but not CASP, showed bacterial translocation to liver and lung but only little bacterial dissemination into the spleen (Supplementary Figure S1 ). It has been reported previously that mechanical manipulation of the gut leads to inflammation of the intestinal wall causing translocation of gut bacteria (Schwarz et al, 2002) . Consequently, as bacteria translocated to the liver and lung, but did not reach the spleen in significant numbers, those mice did not develop any impairment of CTL immunity ( Figure 1C ). As CTL immunity was also suppressed when using heat killed (HK) E. coli or when treating E. coli-infected mice with antibiotics (Supplementary Figure S2) , we assume that the suppressive effect was independent of persistence of living bacteria. Furthermore, using defined numbers of E. coli instead of CASP had the advantage of investigating the effect of bacteria on generation of CTL responses in a quantitative manner. Thus, it was possible to show that systemic injected E. coli suppressed generation of antiviral CTL immunity in a dose-and time-dependent fashion ( Figure 1D ). Furthermore, as i.v. injection of E. coli and CASP treatment suppressed CTL responses in a similar fashion we used i.v. injection of E. coli to mimic sepsis from now on throughout the manuscript.",

We recently showed that Adenovirus selectively infected metallophillic marginal zone macrophages (MMM). However, CD8 \u00fe T cells were not activated by MMM, but rather by CD8 \u00fe DEC205 \u00fe DCs, which received antigen from MMM by a so far undefined transfer mechanism (Backer et al, 2010) . To exclude that during sepsis CTL responses against subsequent (bacterial or viral) infections were only impaired because due to a lower infectivity less antigen was available for presentation, infection with AdOVA was substituted by soluble OVA. Indeed, we could show that septic mice were also unable to mount a CTL response against soluble OVA ( Figure 1G ), thus confirming our hypothesis that sepsis had impeded CTL immunity by directly impairing T-cell activation, rather than by lowering antigen availability.",

Whereas the contribution of TLRs to systemic inflammation after bacterial dissemination is well defined (Beutler, 2004) , little is known about their role in inhibition of CTL immunity (Mellor et al, 2005; Wilson et al, 2006; Wingender et al, 2006) . This led us to investigate whether individual TLR ligands inhibited CTL immunity. Similar to the inhibitory effect of E. coli, the TLR2 ligand Pam3Cys, the TLR4 ligand LPS and the TLR9 ligand CpG1668, all prevented induction of antiviral CTL immunity if applied intravenously 1 day before systemic viral infection (Figure 2A) . While this suggested a broad involvement of several TLRs in regulation of 10 11 E. coli lux was given orally to C57BL/6 mice 1 h before CASP. Bacterial distribution measured and quantified by bioluminescence imaging at indicated time points in vivo or in isolated organs.

The apparent discrepancy between the effect of TLR ligands and Gram-negative sepsis on development of immune paralysis may relate to distinct mechanisms employed by different cell populations to sense soluble TLR ligands or bacterial infection. As TLR4 transmits signals via two adapter molecules, that is, MyD88 and TRIF, we next characterized the individual contribution of these adapter molecules to inhibition of antiviral CTL immunity by using mice deficient either for MyD88 or for TRIF. While Gram-negative sepsis still impaired CTL immunity in MyD88 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Figure 2d ), we observed generation of strong antiviral CTL immunity in TRIF \u00c0/\u00c0 mice ( Figure 2E ).

Importantly, sepsis-induced inhibition of CTL immunity was prevented in vivo through pre-existent CD4 Tcell help generated by prior vaccination of mice with E15R, an MHC class II binding OVA peptide known to induce a strong CD4 T-cell response ( Figure 4G ; Bonifaz et al, 2002; Boscardin et al, 2006) . In order to differentiate whether CD4 T-cell help acted directly on DCs to overcome the inhibitory effects of type I IFN, we targeted antigen directly to DCs using DEC205-OVA in combination with anti-CD40 antibodies, that are known to functionally mature DCs by mimicking CD4 T-cell help (Bonifaz et al, 2002; Bevan, 2004; Boscardin et al, 2006; Kurts et al, 2010) . Although anti-CD40 treatment efficiently induced CTL immunity in untreated mice indicating functional maturation of DCs, such treatment did not prevent inhibition of antiviral CTL immunity after sepsis ( Figure 4H ). This indicated that DCs were severely impaired by type I IFN in their function to stimulate T cells. Moreover, we observed a reduced MHC-II restricted presentation to naive CD4 T cells after treatment of immature DCs with type I IFN in vitro ( Figure 4I ), suggesting that type I IFN not only rendered DCs non-responsive to CD4 T cell-mediated maturation but also already impaired generation of CD4 T-cell help.",

In combination with complete recovery of function in DCs lacking IFNAR expression this suggested that type I IFN produced by other cell types in response to TLR4/TRIF signalling might be acting on DCs. To identify this cell population producing type I IFN, we examined the cellular distribution in the spleen of systemically circulating recombinant bacteria that gain fluorescence activity after phagocytic uptake. Such bacteria were found in the marginal zone of the spleen in the vicinity of Siglec1 \u00fe macrophages ( Figure 5A ). Local expression of type I IFN within the marginal zone in response to bacteria was suggested by strong expression of the IFN-sensitive MxA protein ( Figure 5B ) and was directly detected by measuring type I IFN gene expression by RT-PCR ( Figure 5C ). Expression levels of type I IFN in the spleen ( Figure 5C , left panel) directly correlated with inhibition of CTL immunity (Figure 5c, right panel) .",

Interestingly, clodronate treatment abrogated sepsis-induced expression of type I IFN in the spleen ( Figure 5D ), suggesting that macrophages were instrumental in suppression of T-cell immunity. Consequently, in the absence of macrophages, DCs targeted by DEC205-OVA were then able to mount antiviral CTL immunity after sepsis ( Figure 5E ). The importance of macrophages for suppression of CTL immunity was further demonstrated in experiments using mice lacking IFNAR only on macrophages (LysMCre \u00c2 IFNAR fl/fl ). Similarly to mice lacking IFNAR on DCs, CTL responses in septic mice lacking Figure 4 Type I IFN blocked DC ability to induce antimicrobial CTL immunity. (A) C57BL/6 mice received 10 6 E. coli i.v. either 1 day before or 1 day after infection with AdOVA; 5 days later cytotoxic activity (right panel) was correlated with frequencies of OVA-specific CTLs, which were determined by S8L/H-2K b pentamer staining (left panel). (B) C57BL/6 mice received 10 6 E. coli or 1000 IU IFNa/b i.v. 1 day before or IFNa/b 1 day after infection with AdOVA. Cytotoxic response was determined 5 days later in spleen. (C) CD11c \u00fe cells were isolated from spleens 24 h after AdOVA infection from control mice and mice pretreated with 1 \u00c210 6 E. coli. CD11c \u00fe cells were co-incubated o/n with OTI T cells and supernatants were analysed for IL-2 by ELISA. (D) DCs of control mice or mice injected with 10 6 E. coli or IFNa/b were isolated 24 h later from spleen and restimulated with CpG-DNA in vitro. Supernatants were analysed for IL-6 and IL-12 24 h later by ELISA. (E) Immature BM-DCs were treated with 300 units/ml IFNa/b for 16 h, followed by incubation with indicated concentrations of OVA for 3 h. T-cell activation was determined by IL-2 ELISA from supernatant after o/n incubation of DCs with (E) OT-I or (I) OT-II cells. (F) OVA-specific CTL immunity was determined in C57BL/6 and CD11cCre IFNAR fl/fl mice. Mice were either left untreated or injected i.v. with 10 6 E. coli 1 day prior to infection with AdOVA. (G) Mice were either immunized s.c. with OVA derived I-Ab peptide E15R and pIC/CpG-DNA or left untreated. Seven days later, indicated mice were injected i.v. with 10 6 E. coli and infected with AdOVA 24 h later; OVA-specific CTL immunity was determined 5 days later. (H) One day before mice received a combination of 5 mg anti-DEC205-OVA i.v. \u00fe 20 mg anti-CD40, mice were injected i.v. with 10 6 E. coli or left untreated. Five days later OVA-specific CTL immunity was determined in spleen. Data are shown as mean\u00b1s.e.m. with n \u00bc 3 mice per group. Representative data of at least two independent experiments are shown. IFNAR on macrophages were no longer suppressed ( Figure 5F ). These results demonstrate that macrophages not only control CTL immunity by transferring antigen to CD8 \u00fe DCs (Backer et al, 2010) , but also regulate T-cell activation via type I IFN. Figure 5D clearly shows that macrophages were responsible for the production of type I IFN after interaction with bacteria. Only little type I IFN expression was detected when IFNAR expression was absent from DCs, macrophages or all cells ( Figure 5G ). This is most likely explained by amplifying positive feed forward loop in macrophages and DCs to increase initial IFN responses.",

Here, we report that septic paralysis of T-cell immunity was only observed when bacteria disseminated in sufficiently high numbers via the blood stream into the spleen, indicating that suppressive mechanisms acted mostly in the spleen. This hypothesis is further supported by reports showing that the spleen is centrally affected during bacterial sepsis (Cohen, 2002; Hotchkiss and Karl, 2003; Hotchkiss et al, 2009) . So far, immune paralysis was described to result from irreversible changes in the splenic architecture and depletion of immune cells occurring as a late consequence of bacterial sepsis (Cohen, 2002; Hotchkiss and Karl, 2003; Hotchkiss et al, 2009 ). Our results demonstrate, however, that at least at early time points after SIRS immune paralysis is a reversible state not yet caused by cell depletion but by functional inhibition of DCs.",

Consequently, in patients suffering from sepsis increased levels of IL-10 were measured in serum, which was directly correlated with the observed impaired adaptive immunity. Furthermore, it has been convincingly shown that monocytes of such septic patients exhibit a decreased expression of MHC II molecules and an inability to produce TNF (Docke et al, 1997; Volk et al, 2000) . Despite this clear association of septic immune paralysis with IL-10, immune paralysis, as observed here at early time points after sepsis, clearly did not depend on IL-10 but on type I IFN. This suggests that distinct phases of septic immune paralysis exist, which seem to be governed by different molecular mechanisms: An early phase that is regulated by type I IFN causing a reversible suppression of adaptive immunity and (later) phases, which are characterized by deletion of immune cells and overall irreversible changes in the spleen (Cohen, 2002; Hotchkiss and Karl, 2003; Hotchkiss et al, 2009) , involving IL-10 at some point.",

To our surprise, only TLR4 was instrumental in sensing bacterial infection leading to early septic immune paralysis, although Gram-negative bacteria in principle should be sensed by a variety of TLRs recognizing other structural components. In this respect, death from Gram-negative septic shock induced by a massive bacterial load was reported to also depend exclusively on TLR4 (Roger et al, 2009) , indicating that this receptor is essential for both phases of sepsis, the inflammatory and the immune paralysis phase. However, while death during the inflammatory phase involved both adapter molecules downstream of TLR4, that is, MyD88 and TRIF (Weighardt et al, 2002 (Weighardt et al, , 2004 , immune paralysis during early septic immune paralysis occurred only in response to TRIF-mediated but not to MyD88-mediated signalling.

            "text": "Type I IFN has pleiotrophic effects and has been reported to promote pro-inflammatory as well as anti-inflammatory responses (Biron, 2001; Trinchieri, 2010) . Among others, the complexity of type I IFN activity is demonstrated by its clinical use to either attenuate autoimmunity in multiple sclerosis or to increase T-cell immunity in chronic hepatitis B and C (Trinchieri, 2010) . Without any doubt, type I IFN is a strong activator of adaptive immunity, by stimulating both DCs and T cells (Biron, 2001; Curtsinger et al, 2005; Longhi et al, 2009; Trinchieri, 2010) . Among the many reports describing an immune stimulatory role for type I IFN some reports clearly demonstrate that type I IFN stimulates CTL immunity by enhancing DC differentiation and maturation (Hoebe et al, 2003; Honda et al, 2003) improving crosspriming (Le Bon et al, 2003; Dunn et al, 2005) and by directly stimulating T-cell proliferation as signal 3 (Curtsinger et al, 2005) . On the other hand, type I IFN has been shown to inhibit antiviral immunity by blocking DC differentiation from precursor cells (Hahm et al, 2005) , by inhibiting crosspresentation in vitro (Longman et al, 2007) and by inducing a refractory state in DCs (Zuniga et al, 2008) . Adding to this list of reports ascribing a negative regulatory role for type IFN, we report here a novel negative regulatory function for type I IFN in inhibiting DC function early after Gram-negative sepsis where type I IFN jeopardized antiviral as well as antibacterial CTL immunity. How can the paradox of type I IFN being both stimulatory and suppressive be explained? Our observations suggest that type I IFN has distinct effects depending on the differentiation status of the DC and time point and location of IFN production. In this respect, we have observed that systemic E. coli was only suppressive if injected before AdOVA infection, and was rather stimulatory, if injected after AdOVA infection. Furthermore, the suppressive effect of E. coli could be replaced by recombinant type I IFN, proving its suppressive potential when given before antigen challenge. In line with our observations, also other groups have reported paradox effects of type I IFN (Hahm et al, 2005; Longman et al, 2007) . The authors explain this seemingly contradicting effect of type I IFN by correlating stimulatory and suppressive functions of type I IFN with the usage of different STAT molecules downstream of the IFNAR (Hahm et al, 2005; Longman et al, 2007) . They convincingly show that immature DCs, where IFNAR is associated with STAT1 and STAT3, are suppressed, while matured DCs, where IFNAR is associated with STAT4, are further activated by type I IFN. These data explain how the same cytokine can have opposing effects. As immature DCs are situated at the splenic marginal zone , it is conceivable that during sepsis type I IFN produced by marginal zone macrophages strongly suppresses those immature marginal zone DCs, while activated DCs, which already have migrated to the T-cell zone, are stimulated by type I IFN.",

            "text": "A possible explanation for the seemingly paradox role of type I IFN on adaptive immunity might be related to the time point when type I IFN acts on antigen-presenting cells: while there is ample evidence that the presence of type I IFN during antigen presentation to T cells leads to immunity, our data suggest that temporal dissociation of type I IFN production from antigen presentation can result in inhibition of DC function. If our reasoning is correct, it should allow the immune system to differentiate between dangerous pathogens and selfproteins, simply because only pathogens would provide both signals simultaneously, that is, antigen and PAMPs, whereas self-antigens do not. The hypothesis of loco-temporal differentiation of self and non-self is supported by a report, which convincingly showed that T-cell activation was already prevented, if antigen and TLR ligands were present in the same APC, but separated in different vesicles (Blander and Medzhitov, 2006) . Thus, we speculate that the mechanism reported here, has evolved as fail-safe mechanism to protect from autoimmunity during infection. Therefore, the development of autoimmunity in some individuals following infections may be related to a failure of type I IFN-mediated control of DC function. With respect to sepsis, induction of immune paralysis via TLR4 may represent an accidental activation of this fail-safe mechanism by systemic bacteria expressing molecular structures resembling endogenous TLR4 ligands (Cohen, 2002; Hotchkiss and Karl, 2003; Hotchkiss et al, 2009 ).",

Following incubation of sections (5 mm) with aSER-4 and aCD11c mAbs (45 min), sections were stained with anti-GFP mAb and Streptavidin-AlexaFluor s 488 (30 min). Nuclei were stained with 1 mg/ml DAPI for 10 min. MxA labelling was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections (4 mm). Sections were incubated with anti-MxA mAb (dilution 1:100) overnight at room temperature. Secondary labelling was performed using the LSAB2 kit (DAKO) (Wenzel et al, 2005) .Cell isolation, ex-vivo co-culture, cell culture assays BM-DCs were generated as described before (Busch et al, 2008) . For antigen presentation assays, BM-DCs were incubated with 2 \u00c210 5 OT-I or OT-II cells. T-cell activation was determined by measuring IL-2 by ELISA. CD8a \u00fe T cells were obtained from spleens and lymph nodes of OT-I/RAG1 \u00c0/\u00c0 transgenic mice (Hogquist et al, 1994) and enriched using nylon wool (Kisker Biotech, Steinfurt, Germany). For isolation of DCs ex vivo, spleens were collagenase digested for 15 min before isolating cells. After incubation with anti-CD11c magnetic beads (Miltenyi), DCs were purified using auto-MACS s (Miltenyi). 3 \u00c210 5 purified CD11c \u00fe DCs were co-cultured with 10 5 naive OVA-specific CD8 T cells in flat-bottom 96-well plates. Coculture supernatants for ELISA were collected after 24 h. To determine the effect of systemic bacteria on cross-presentation, 1 \u00c210 5 CD11c \u00fe DCs were isolated from spleens of control mice, and mice infected with 1 \u00c210 6 E. coli prior to infection with AdOVA. DCs were incubated with 2 \u00c210 5 isolated OTI cells and IL-2 secretion was determined after o/n incubation by ELISA. To determine IL-6 and IL-12 production of ex-vivo isolated DCs, DCs were isolated as described above and stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml CpG-DNA. After 24 h, supernatants were analysed by ELISA.",

            "text": "For flow cytometric analysis, cells were stained with fluorochromeconjugated anti-mouse CD8a, CD11b, CD11c, CD86, I-A/I-E, H2-K b (eBioscience, San Diego, USA or BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany), or H-2K b /SIINFEKL pentamers (S8L/H-2K b ; Proimmune, Oxford, UK). Hoechst-33258 (1 mg/ml) was added to exclude dead cells and cells were analysed by flow cytometry (BD Canto II). For detection of OVA-specific CD8 T cells, splenocytes of each group were pooled and stained with anti-CD8a and S8L/H-2K b pentamers according to manufacturers guide. Absolute cell numbers were determined with calibrite beads s (BD Bioscience). For analysis of antigen uptake, cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml OVA-Alexa647 (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) for 15 min and analysed by flow cytometry.CTL activity was determined in vivo as described previously (Feuerer et al, 2003; Wingender et al, 2006) . Briefly, splenocytes from syngeneic donor mice were pulsed with 1 mM of the specific H-2K b peptides SIINFEKL (Ovalbumin), ASNENMETM and SSLEN-FRAYV (Influenza A PR8), or SSIEFARL (HSV), for 30 min at 371C and subsequently with 1 mM of CFSE or FarRed for 15 min (CFSE high or FarRed, specific target cells). Reference cells were not pulsed with peptide and labelled with 0.1 mM CFSE for 15 min (CFSE low , reference cells). Both cell populations were mixed at a 1:1 ratio (CFSE high /FarRed:CFSE low ) and 10 7 total cells were injected into the tail vein. Four hours later, lysis of peptide-loaded cells was quantified by measuring the ratio of CFSE high /FarRed and CFSE low cells via flow cytometry (Canto II, BD Biosciences). The percentage of specific lysis was calculated using the following equation: 100\u00c0[(CFSE high /CFSE low ) immunized /(CFSE high /CFSE low ) naive ] \u00c2 100.Analysis of cytokine production IL-2, IL-6, IFNg and IL-12 in serum and supernatants were determined using standard sandwich ELISA according to the manufacturer's guide (eBiosciences, San Diego, USA).Groups of three mice were infected with E. coli at different doses (1 \u00c210 3 , 1 \u00c210 4 , 1 \u00c210 5 , 1 \u00c210 6 (n \u00bc 3)). To test the influence of macrophages in these setting additional three mice were treated with clodronate liposomes (200 ml i.v.) at day \u00c07 prior infection with E. coli (1 \u00c210 6 ). Fresh frozen spleen samples from all case groups as well as from three wild-type mice were pestled in liquid nitrogen and subsequently lysed in Trizol (Invitrogen). In all, 500 ng RNA was reverse transcribed using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). RT-PCR was performed using the Light Cycler Taqman master kit thereby amplifying the IFNB1 gene (NM_010510.0) and the 18S rRNA gene as reference control based on a Universal ProbeLibrary Assay on a Light Cycler 480 instrument (Roche). Analysis was performed with the Light-Cycler 480 Software release 1.5.0 and RelQuant software (Roche). Briefly, the IFNb1/18S ratio was calculated for each of the samples using the DC t method. Next, data were normalized by dividing the DC t values for IFNB1 of each groups of through the arithmetic mean of all DC t IFNB1 values from the wild-type mice (DDC t value). Data were analysed by applying a one-sided unpaired T-test assuming different variances.Primers used were m18sRNAforward#55: AAATCAAGTTATGGT TCCTTGGTC, m18sRNAreverse#55: GGTCTAGGAAATTACCACAGT TATCCAA, internal probe 55. mIFNB1forward#18: CTGGCTTCCA TCATGAACAA, mIFNB1reverse#18: AGAGGCTGTGGTGGAGGAA, internal probe 18.",
