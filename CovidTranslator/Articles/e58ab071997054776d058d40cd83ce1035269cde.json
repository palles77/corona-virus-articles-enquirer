Study design Eligible infants aged #4 months presenting to the main pediatric emergency service with apnea associated bronchiolitis were stratified by gestational age (<34 weeks or longer) and randomized to receive a single dose of intravenous 25 mg/kg caffeine citrate or saline placebo.

Secondary outcomes were frequency of apnea by 24, 48, and 72 hours after study medication, need for noninvasive/invasive ventilation, and length of stay in the hospital's pediatric intensive care/step-down unit.",

            "text": "V iral bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection in infants, leading to 15 hospitalizations per 1000 person-years. Of these, 1.6% to 4% are admitted with apnea. 1-4 Bronchiolitis-associated apnea, a subset of apnea associated with respiratory viruses, appears to be a mixed central and obstructive apnea resulting from a complex interplay of respiratory drive suppression and airway secretions driven by a hyperactive laryngochemoreflex, somnogenic cytokines, and in some cases by virus-specific respiratory suppressant surface proteins. [5] [6] [7] Caffeine is a standard treatment for apnea of prematurity 8,9 and postextubation apnea in preterm infants, 10 and has been used to ameliorate apnea complicating bronchiolitis on the basis of case reports and observational studies. 11-17 Caffeine increases central respiratory drive and chemoreceptor sensitivity to CO 2 and improves skeletal muscle contractions, reducing diaphragm fatigue and leading to better ventilation. 18 Increased metabolic demand, diuresis, tachycardia, dysrhythmias, feeding intolerance, reduced weight gain, and seizures are the reported short-term side effect of caffeine. 19 Although evidence from prospective studies for caffeine used to treat apnea in bronchiolitis is lacking, the drug is commonly used in an attempt to avoid intubation and is considered a standard of care in some institutions. 11,17,20 Thus, we compared blinded intravenous caffeine citrate with placebo for shortening the time to resolution of acute bronchiolitis-associated apnea.",

The currently available evidence for caffeine use in bronchiolitis-related apnea is observational, from case reports including 7 patients and 3 retrospective studies including 60 patients. Three case reports suggested a decreased need for intubation and mechanical ventilation after caffeine administration, but 1 report found no benefit. [13] [14] [15] [16] One retrospective study showed a decrease in apnea attacks at 2 hours after caffeine administration, 17 another found a decreased need for intubation in a caffeine group compared with a noncaffeine group, and a third reported inconclusive findings and called for further research. 17, 18, 31 Our results show no difference in the frequency of apneas reported for the 2 groups in the first 3 days. Our findings do not support the routine use of caffeine to treat apnea in bronchiolitis, especially in light of the reported serious side effects of the drug. 19 We believe that our findings are robust because we applied strict enrollment criteria in a randomized blinded trial, with patients undergoing continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring in PICU/ step-down units for a median length of stay of 55 hours with a #1:2 nurse:patient.",
