Dose response modelling is an inherently multidisciplinary field, which collates knowledge and data from disparate scientific fields. This multidisciplinary nature presents a key challenge to the expansion of microbial dose response modelling into new groups of researchers and modelers. This research employs a dose response optimization R code used in 18 peer-reviewed research studies to develop a multi-functional dose response software. The underlying R code performs an optimization of the two primary dose response models using the MLE method and outputs statistical analyses of the fits and bootstrapped uncertainty information for the models. VizDR (Visual Dose Response) was developed to provide microbial dose response modelling capabilities to a larger audience. VizDR is programmed in JavaScript with underlying Python scripts for intercommunication with Rserve. VizDR allows for dose response model visualization and optimization of a user's own experimental data. , (J. Mitchell).",

Dose response modelling can be considered a niche research field, requiring a solid understanding of microbiology, pathology, mathematics and statistics. The microbiology skills are to understand the protocols used in development and delivery of the inoculum, thus assessing the applicability of the data to dose response modelling. Pathogenesis knowledge is used to determine the relevance and limitations of chosen exposure routes (e.g. intracranial versus inhalation) and the limitations of mechanistic assumptions within the model. Advanced mathematics knowledge is needed to understand how to develop approaches to optimize a model and subsequently write the requisite code to perform such algorithms. Cognizance of statistics allows for the inference of a good fit to candidate data, and to determine the confidence associated with applying the model across multiple hosts, pathogen strains, pathogen isolates and exposure routes.",

            "text": "A model is only as relevant as its underlying assumptions and methods of derivation. In the case of microbial dose response modelling it is important to derive a model from mechanistic roots. Theoretically any function that is bounded on (0,1) for the dependent variable range and has support to infinity for the independent variable can be considered a candidate model. In the case of QMRA there is a need for biological plausibility for the dose response models (Haas, 1983; Haas et al., 2014) . Additionally it is often recommended to use biologically plausible dose response models for QMRA by government and nongovernmental organizations (US EPA, 2014; WHO., 2016b). Mechanistic dose response models describing a generalization of the underlying pathogenesis mechanisms provide this biological plausibility. To accomplish this in a generalizable manner Haas et al. (2014) outlines the derivation of the mechanistic models but the underlying principles are: a bolus exposed dose with Poisson variability about the mean (d), from which there is a binomial likelihood of k pathogens that survive to initiate an infection. The mechanistic microbial dose response models are the exponential (Equation (1), parameter r) and beta Poisson (Equation (2), parameters \u03b1 and N 50 ). In Equation (1) r is an estimate of the probability of one organism surviving post-exposure to develop an infection in the host. Equation (2) is an approximation of the exact form of the beta Poisson model, the development of which is outlined in Haas et al. (2014) . Use of the approximated form of the beta Poisson model is predicated on \u03b1 \u226a N 50 and N 50 \u2265 1 (Weir, 2016) . This approximated form retains the linearity at low doses, a vital characteristic of microbial dose response models Weir, 2016) . In Equation (2) N 50 refers to an estimate of the median infectious dose with units of counts (i.e. CFU, PFU, cells, etc.) and \u03b1 is a unitless model parameter.",

The likelihood of having such a large number of doses in microbial dose response modelling however is very low. The goodness of fit is inferred by comparing the minimized Y to the chi-squared (\u03c7 2 ) distribution's critical value. This critical value is selected at a chosen confidence interval (CI; 0.05) and N-m degrees of freedom where: N is the number doses and m is the number of parameters for the respective model (e.g. 1 for exponential).

The BFGS does not require smooth optimizations, and since it estimates the Hessian matrix from gradient evaluations rather than direct derivation (quasi-Newtonian), it is much faster. During a bootstrap iteration the dose response data are randomly sampled with replacement from the positive responses. These new computational data are then used to optimize the dose response models.

One of the limitations of the app can be viewed as the set of models used. The dose response models used are the accepted biologically plausible mechanistic dose response models that have been used in regulatory and other decision analyses VizDR can be used within the QMRA paradigm in two primary ways. First the dose response model that has already been optimized for a known pathogen can be looked up from the QMRA Wiki with ease. By maintaining the tool's mode at \"Dose to Response\" the drop-down menu can be used to find the pathogen of interest to the user. The user is then informed which: dose response model, parameter value and parameter uncertainty values to use in their QMRA. The second primary use is the optimization of the dose response models to the user's own data. This allow the user to determine a best fitting optimized dose response model based on their data or data from the open literature. This can be for data not included in the QMRA Wiki's warehouse of dose response data or their own animal model data. In both of these uses the user is aided in performing a Monte Carlo for the QMRA with ease since the uncertainty of the dose response model parameter can be included in the Monte Carlo QMRA model.",

This was done for three reasons: first, this form of the beta Poisson is easier for novices and students to understand and to make inferences with since N 50 is an estimate of the median infectious dose. Second, the optimization of the hypergeometric function is not sufficiently stable for an online app such as this one. Third, regulators, engineers and decision analysts -primary target users of VizDR -are likelier to be familiar with QMRA in general, therefore, this form of the beta Poisson model.",

As the use of QMRA models for policy and wider decisions beyond engineering systems increases, expansion of the field to include less quantitatively oriented scientists is needed. This can be heavily limited by the requirement for a dose response model to perform a modern QMRA and the lack of one being a quantitative gap precluding them from developing a QMRA model. To this end software has been developed to allow for easy access to a library of peer reviewed dose response models and data. This software (VizDR: Visual Dose Response) allows for easy reference and visualization of the dose response models already housed in the QMRAWiki. VizDR visualizes the best dose response model to use for a selected pathogen. VizDR also allows for the use of the same optimization code developed by dose response modelling experts and used in 18 individual dose response modelling research projects. VizDR is designed to address the dose response modelling step in the QMRA framework, thus being a first step in an adaptive QMRA software. VizDR will also allow quantitative scientists greater time to focus on the environmental exposure and risk characterization models in the QMRA.",

Therefore, the app will be continually hosted on the QMRAWiki, an interactive knowledge repository and platform for collaborative QMRA development (Mitchell et al., 2014) . It will be updated with new functionality as needed or requested. Uncertainty plot for \u03b1 and N50 parameter estimates from the bootstrap ellipses are confidence ellipses for the corresponding confidence levels. Plot shows a tight grouping of estimates from the 10,000 iterations, from this plot percentiles can be directly inferred. Dose to response and response to dose modes, both of these act as the dose response model visualization portion of VizDR. As can be seen an easy look up of the best fitting dose response model for B. anthracis is being visualized for 10,000 spores. Data upload screen for use of the user's own experimental data or data garnered from a literature review. The first outputs demonstrate the inferences that can be made from the dose response optimization. Table 2 Example of goodness of fit analysis and resulting inference. Table 3 Example of better fitting model analysis and resulting inference. Table 4 Resulting dose response parameters from the non-bootstrapped MLE. ",
