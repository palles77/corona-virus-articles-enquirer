            "text": "Background: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) causes lower respiratory tract infections, particularly in young children and the elderly. Methods: A prospective study was conducted on the clinical characteristics of infants ,2 years of age admitted to hospital for respiratory infection and the characteristics of hMPV infections were compared with those of infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Influenza A, B and C viruses, RSV, parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses were simultaneously detected in clinical samples by multiple reverse transcription nested-PCR assay. The presence of hMPV was tested in all samples using two separate RT-PCR tests. Results: A respiratory virus was detected in 65.9% of the 749 children included in the study. hMPV, found in 69 of the positive nasopharyngeal aspirates (14%), was the most common virus after RSV. Peak incidence was in March and over 80% of children were ,12 months of age. The most common diagnoses were recurrent wheezing (49.3%) and bronchiolitis (46.4%). Oxygen therapy was required by 58% of patients, and assisted ventilation by one. Clinical characteristics in the 18 co-infections were indistinguishable from those of single infections. Fifty one hMPV single infections were compared with 88 hRSV single infections. Recurrent wheezing was diagnosed more frequently in hMPV patients. All other variables tested were similar in both groups. Conclusions: hMPV was the second most frequent virus after RSV in infants ,2 years of age hospitalised for respiratory infection and was associated with lower respiratory tract infections. hMPV occurred predominantly in springtime. Co-infections were frequent and clinically similar to single infections and RSV infections.",

            "text": "H uman metapneumovirus (hMPV), recently described in the Netherlands, 1 is an RNA virus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family, subfamily Pneumovirinae, genus Metapneumovirus. Although hMPV was first described only 4 years ago, 100% seroprevalence has been found in samples obtained 50 years ago. 1 It is therefore believed this virus may have been present in humans for over five decades. The difficulties in isolating this type of virus from cell cultures have possibly delayed its detection as a common pathogen in children's respiratory infections. Over the past 4 years, this virus has been identified in patients with respiratory diseases in several countries, including Canada, 2 3 Finland, 4 the United Kingdom, 5 Spain, 6 7 the United States, 8 9 and France. 10 hMPV is genetically similar to avian pneumovirus, particularly serotype C. Two main genetic lineages have been identified to date. The phylogenetic studies conducted by the Dutch group 11 show a high similarity to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), with which it shares morphological similarities and similar infective capacity and spectrum of disease. Upper and lower respiratory tract infections, from common colds to pneumonia, are attributed to hMPV, with bronchiolitis being the main clinical sign of primary infection in hospitalised patients. 10 From an epidemiological point of view, hMPV infection shows seasonal behaviour, with a pattern similar to RSV infection, though few prospective studies on its behaviour throughout the whole year are currently available.",

The study was conducted at the paediatric department of Severo Ochoa Hospital in Madrid, Spain. We recruited all children under the age of 2 consecutively admitted to our hospital with acute respiratory infections throughout the 2000-2001, 2001-2002, and 2002-2003 epidemiological seasons (from October 2000 to June 2003). Cystic fibrosis was the only criterion for exclusion. All parents were duly advised, upon admission, that clinical data relating to their children might be used for clinical research purposes. Furthermore, in each case, informed verbal consent was obtained from each of the parents or legal guardians. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were taken from each patient upon admission and sent to the Respiratory Virus Laboratory at the National Microbiology Center (ISCIII, Madrid, Spain). Samples were processed within 24 h of collection for virological study. Indirect immunofluorescence assays and multiplex RT-nested-PCR were carried out on every sample for RSV, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, or enteroviruses. 12 13 A 200 ml aliquot was taken from each NPA sample (with all the necessary precautions being taken to avoid contamination) and then kept frozen at 270\u02daC until analysis for hMPV.",

RT-PCR assays for hMPV were performed as described previously by our group. 14 Briefly, hMPV in respiratory secretions from patients was investigated using two separate RT-PCR assays designed in two different genes, one gene encoding for the matrix protein (M) and the other for the viral polymerase (L), as described elsewhere. 14 Specific primer pairs were designed to amplify highly conserved regions of both M and L genes. Nucleic acids from original samples were extracted as previously described by Casas et al. 15 For reverse transcription and PCR amplification of the M gene, a commercial kit (Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used. A subsequent half-nested PCR reaction was conducted using a total of 2 ml from the first reaction products, which were then added to the reaction mixture (to a final volume of 50 ml). The amplified products were analysed by gel electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide and a 687 bp band was obtained.",

Paediatric series in which both positive and negative samples from infants were studied found an hMPV frequency similar to that reported here. 18 25 27 In our study, the presence of hMPV was investigated in a group of 748 infants under the age of 2 hospitalised for respiratory infection throughout three entire epidemiological seasons, that is, 36 months, without interruption. The overall frequency was 14% and may be an adequate approximation of the actual prevalence of hMPV in this population. The high frequency of hMPV found in this setting suggests investigation of hMPV should be included in the diagnostic routine for respiratory infections among hospitalised infants, as it seems to play a more significant role than adenoviruses and influenza or parainfluenza viruses in this age group. Obviously, improving the aetiological diagnosis of viral infections might avoid unnecessary therapy, antibiotics in particular, and would allow for preventive isolation of infected patients.

This co-infection rate is among the highest reported to date after the series by Greensill et al, 36 Maggi et al, 25 and Cuevas et al, 19 all of whom reported coinfection in 30%-70% of all hospitalised young children. The overlap in seasonal distribution between hMPV and RSV could explain the high frequency of co-infections. Studying the presence of hMPV only in samples negative for other respiratory viruses might well underestimate the true frequency of hMPV; this is probably one of the most important factors in explaining the different rates of hMPV seen in very similar populations. 6 7 The role of hMPV as a concomitant pathogen in these dual infections has not yet been fully established. Some studies 34 36 37 suggested co-infections are more severe. Other series, however, did not report differences in severity between co-infections and single infections. 23 27 In our series, there were no significant differences in diagnosis, need for oxygen therapy, length of hospital stay, frequency of fever, antibiotic therapy, or radiological changes between co-infections and single infections, suggesting that the presence of hMPV in the setting of another viral respiratory infection does not make the condition more severe.

Within this age group, clinical signs are indistinguishable from those associated with RSV infection. The results obtained to date lead us to recommend that human metapneumovirus be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of acute respiratory infections in hospitalised infants, mainly in order to differentiate these from infections caused by the RSV.

We need to recruit a team of willing reviewers, both generalists and specialists, who are prepared to read and review new books (and CD-ROMs, etc) within a three-month deadline: could you help? You will have the option to decline if you can't manage a review in time.Unfortunately ADC cannot pay reviewers, but you will be able to keep the book for yourself or your department. Trainees are particularly welcome to apply.For logistical reasons reviewers should be based in the UK or Republic of Ireland and internet access is essential.Please contact archdischild@bmjgroup.com with brief details of special interests and reviewing experience, if any (include BOOK REVIEWS in the subject field).",
