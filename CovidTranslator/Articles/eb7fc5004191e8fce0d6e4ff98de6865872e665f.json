            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new emerging human infectious disease caused by Severe Acute 24 Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also previously known as 2019-nCoV), originated in 25 Wuhan seafood and animal market, China. Since December 2019, more than 69,000 cases of COVID-19 have 26 been confirmed in China and quickly spreads to other counties. Currently, researchers put their best efforts to 27 identify effective drugs for COVID-19. The neutralizing antibody, which binds to viral capsid in a manner that 28 inhibits cellular entry of virus and uncoating of the genome, is the specific defense against viral invaders. In this 29 study, we investigate to identify neutralizing antibodies that can bind to SARS-CoV-2 Sipke (S) protein and 30 interfere with the interaction between viral S protein and a host receptor by bioinformatic methods. The 31 sequence analysis of S protein showed two major differences in the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein 32 compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV related bat viruses (btSARS-CoV). The insertion regions were close to 33 interacting residues with the human ACE2 receptor. Epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies revealed that 34 SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used conformational epitopes, whereas MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies 35 used a common linear epitope region, which contributes to form the \u03b2-sheet structure in MERS-CoV S protein 36 and deleted in SARS-CoV-2 S protein. To identify effective neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, the 37 binding affinities of neutralizing antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 S protein were predicted and compared by 38 antibody-antigen docking simulation. The result showed that CR3022 neutralizing antibody from human may 39 have higher binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 S protein than SARS-CoV S protein. We also found that 40 F26G19 and D12 mouse antibodies could bind to SARS-CoV S protein with high affinity. Our findings provide 41 crucial clues towards the development of antigen diagnosis, therapeutic antibody, and the vaccine against SARS-42 CoV-2. 43 44 45",

Ying and colleges 74 showed the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) interacts with ACE2 75 [14] . McLaellen and colleges showed that ACE2 binds to SARS-CoV-2 S protein with much higher affinity than 76 to SARS-CoV S protein [15] .

The mean scores of the docking simulation are shown in Table 2. 219 Among the SARS-CoV antibodies, only CR3022 showed that the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 was 220 higher than SARS-CoV. In addition, the docking score distribution of CR3022 was significantly changed 221 between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4) . For the CR3022 antibody, the mean score of binding affinity 222 was increased from -11.21 dG score (SARS-CoV, crystal structure) to -13.91 dG score (SARS-CoV-2, cryo-EM 223 structure) with a p-value of 0.00367. The binding affinity of all antibody-antibgen docking was tested using 224 1000 generated structures. Interestingly, the CR3022 was experimentally performed for the binding effect of 225 SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD [14] .

To predict the 115 missing region of cryo-EM structure in SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD, we performed homology modeling based on 116 known the three dimensional structure of SARS-CoV (PDB ID: 6NB7) using SWISS-MODEL 117 (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) [28].

Rosetta SnugDock program can refine 135 homology models with the flexible and uncertain region, because the program simulates most of conformation 136 space available to antibody paratopes [33]. With the complex structures of RBD and antibody candidates, all-137 atom relax protocol, docking prepack protocol, and antibody-antigen docking simulation were carried out to 138 calculate the free energy of low-energy binding conformations. The distiribution of docking scores displayed as 139 funnel plots using interface RMD (interface RMS) versus the binding score (dG binding) between antibody and 140 antigen(Fig. 4). The binding score was used Rosetta's docking interface score (based on the Talaris2013 force 141 field) to rank the complexes. Rosetta interface score is defined as Isc = Ebound \u2212 Eunbound, where Ebound is 142 the score of the bound complex and Eunbound is the sum of the scores of the individual protein partners in 143 isolation. In addition, 1000 independent docking runs were performed to generate the antibody-antigen models.144To predict possible neutralizing antibody candidates of SARS-CoV-2, the docking results were compared 145 between interface binding scores of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD (homology modeling) and interface binding scores of 146 SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV S-RBD (crystal structure) with 11 antibodies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have 147 been developed.

            "text": "155 sequence alignments showed that there were insertions and deletion during the divergence among the strains 156 (Fig. 1B and 1C). Various deletions were observed in SARS-CoV related group. The NTD region (position 71-157 77, GTNGTKR) of S protein in the strain Wuhan-Hu-1 was mostly conserved in SARS-CoV-2 group but not in 158 SARS-CoV related group. The NTD region was also conserved in other btSARS-CoV strains but the sequence 159 similarity was low.160 Interestingly, human pathogenic strains and their closest strains had two insertion sequences in RBD 161 region of SARS-CoV-2. The amino acid position 445-449 (VGGNY) and 470-486 (TEIYQAGSTPCNGVEGF) 162 were conserved in SARS-CoV-2 related group except bat-SL-CoVZC45 strain and the corresponding sequences 163 in SARS-related groups were 'STGNY' and 'NVPFSPDGKPCTPPAL' (Fig. 1C). The results could not give 164 clear answers that these insertion sequences had directly diverged from the common ancestor of SARS-CoV and 165 SARS-CoV-2 or that the sequences in SARS-CoV-2 were derived from SARS-CoV related group by mobile 166 genetic elements [34]. Nevertheless, the insertion sequences have several antibody epitope regions (Fig. 2) and 167 the two key residues (amino acid position 455 and 486) interacting with human ACE2 [35] which is used as a 168 cellular receptor of btSARS-CoV strain WIV1 [36]. This suggested that these sequence were might be related 169 with human susceptibility and virulence. 170 171 Identification and analysis of the neutralizing antibody epitopes 172 Previously, numbers of neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been developed [17, 18].",

            "text": "180 region (EDGDYYRKQL) for MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies was specific insertion of MERS-CoV S 181 protein. MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies interacted with three receptor binding residues (E536, D537, D539) 182 in the linear epitope region, which results in the neutralizing activity of antibodies by directly interferes the 183 binding between S protein and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 of human . In addition, the difference of binding aspect of 184 neutralizing antibodies might be caused by the difference of subdomain structure of receptor binding motif 185 (RBM). The RBM of SARS-CoV S protein is made of mainly coiled structure with two short \u03b2-sheets, whereas 186 the RBM of MERS-CoV S protein consists of four long \u03b2-sheets [37]. Sequence alignment revealed that RBD of 187 SARS-CoV-2 was more similar to that of SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV (Fig. 2). Therefore, this suggested that 188 SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies could be effective for SARS-CoV-2. 189 190 S-RBD structure modeling and superimposition of neutralizing antibodies 191 Human infection of SARS-CoV-2 was firstly reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China last December [4].192Previous studies have reported several results for the interaction between S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 193 as a receptor[13, 14, 16, 38]. However, any interaction of SARS-CoV-2 S protein with developed neutralizing 194 antibodies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has not been reported yet. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein 195 was used S protein which revealed by cryo electron microscopy structure. Subsequently, the missing region of 196 SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD region comprising of 181 amino acids were built from SARS-CoV S proteins (PDB ID:",
