They also demonstrated the ability of the cats to excrete H5N1 virus in feces. The authors postulate that spread from one animal to another could occur via three different potential excretory pathwaysrespiratory, digestive, or urinary tract. The finding of routes of excretion is particularly noteworthy and calls for vigilant biosecurity surrounding human cases.",

The term \"zoonosis\" was coined by the German physician Rudolf Virchow exactly 150 years ago, while he was working on the public health issues of trichinosis and alveolar hydatid disease. On the subject of comparative medicine, Virchow stated, \"Between animal and human medicine, there is no dividing line-nor should there be.\" 3 Virchow is a name familiar to all pathologists because he is widely regarded as the father of modern pathology and is heralded for elucidating the cellular nature of disease, which drastically changed the course of medicine. However, it may be his emphasis on considering diseases across species lines that will be his most lasting legacy.",

Human health and animal health are inextricably intertwined, with a steady parade of emerging zoonotic problems over the last 25 years, beginning with human immunodeficiency virus moving from an African primate to humans, creating the most critical new infectious problem facing human health in our generation. Subsequently, there have been a myriad of microbial zoonotic agents surfacing in humans: prions in beef finding their way to neurons in human teenagers; West Nile virus from Israeli geese crossing continents to cause human and equine mortalities in North America; monkeypox virus in African giant rats infecting North American prairie dogs, which then carried the virus into living rooms and human beings in four U.S. states; and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus descending from bats to civet cats to a human super spreader who shared it with fellow travelers from four different continents at a hotel in Hong Kong. 4 And now, avian influenza is making an inexorable march across Asia into Europe, infecting not only expected avian hosts but also potentially cats and people. The interface of human and animal health has become very blurred, and adequate public health measures for zoonotic disease control require an understanding of husbandry and ecology in the animal host.",

Beginning with the death of a three-year-old boy in Hong Kong in May of 1997, there has been a steady string of incidents involving human illness and death due to various highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses contracted from poultry, first in Hong Kong and China, then in the Netherlands, subsequently in Canada, and now, most frighteningly, in Southeast Asia.",

            "text": "Avian influenza (AI) viruses are very widespread in nature and have been isolated from more than 90 different species of free-living birds. Wild birds, especially shorebirds, ducks, and geese, are regarded as the natural reservoir of all AI viruses, with intestinal cells from these species displaying a receptor that is particularly attractive for AI viruses. 6, 7 Most strains of AI are of low pathogenicity and do not pose a significant problem for birds. These low virulence viruses have the type of hemagglutinin glycoprotein precursor that can be cleaved only by trypsin or trypsin-like enzymes. Consequently, replication is restricted to respiratory and intestinal tracts, where these enzymes can be found. Infection of poultry with these low virulent strains may be associated with mild respiratory signs, depression, and decrease in egg production. Occasionally secondary bacterial invaders will create a more critical disease situation. In contrast, the virulent viruses, termed \"highly pathogenic avian influenza\" (HPAI) have an hemagglutinin glycoprotein that can be cleaved by a ubiquitous protease, perhaps furin, that is found in virtually all organs. 8 So, the virulent viruses are not restricted to replication in only the respiratory or intestinal tract but, once within the systemic circulation, have access to all tissues and organs. Pathogenesis studies in chickens have documented this phenomenon. Using immunohistochemistry, it has been shown that the HPAI viruses replicate in endothelial cells throughout the body, with spillover to adjacent parenchymal cells in numerous organs. Depending on the virulence of the strain, death can be peracute without clinical signs or may present with pulmonary, cardiac, or neurological involvement. 9 -11 Thus, it has been recognized for some time that the HPAI viruses are capable of extrapulmonary spread in chickens. Documenting similar distributions in a mammalian host, done by Rimmelzwaan et al 1 in this issue of the American Journal of Pathology, extends the comparative pathology to what is most likely happening in humans.",
