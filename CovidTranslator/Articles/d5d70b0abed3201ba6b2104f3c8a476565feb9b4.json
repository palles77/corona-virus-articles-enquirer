In an effort to prepare unsymmetrical cephalostatin analogues with multi-functionality, we tried the route of selective opening of the spiroketal joining rings E and F. In this study, we have tested several borane complexes (like borane-9-BBN, borane-(N-tosyl)-D D -valine, and borane-catechol) with some bis-steroidal pyrazine derivatives like 3, 4, and 16 aiming at opening ring-F at only one spiro-system of the dimer. Upon testing these borane reagents, satisfying results were obtained in the case of the keto-methylene 4 using the catechol-borane complex. The structures of the resulting mono-opened and also some double-opened spiro dimers have been completely confirmed. Some of the prepared compounds were tested against three cancer cell lines: HM02 (stomach cancer), HEP G2 (hepatocellular cancer), and MCF 7 (breast cancer).",

Their inhibiting abilities to telomerase, stabilizing abilities to G-quadruplex were investigated by repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay, CD melting. The synthesis and pharmacology of a series of 1-deoxy analogs of CP-47,497 (R = H, n = 0-7), both epimeric alcohols and 1-deoxy analogs of CP-55,940 (R = C 3 H 6 OH, n = 0-7), b-hydroxy only, is described. The CB 1 and CB 2 receptor affinities of these compounds are reported. We describe herein a 3D-QSAR model constructed with trypanocidal agents structurally-related to Brazilizone A (2) and the discovery of the 1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-arylhydrazone derivative (15), named Brazilizone N, as a novel potent antichagasic lead-candidate. M\u00d4ultidrug resistance (MDR) has become a major obstacle to the clinicians for the treatment of cancer. In an attempt to find clinically useful chemosensitizers, 17 chloroacridones were synthesized and evaluated for anti-MDR activity. Five compounds were able to reverse completely the 25-fold resistance of KBCh R -8-5 cells to VLB and therefore, these compounds constitute the promising anti-MDR agents that should be further tested in animal model systems. A series of novel N 0 -tert-butyl-N 0 -substitutedbenzoyl-N-5-chloro-6-chromanecarbohydrazide derivatives were synthesized, and their larvicidal activities against Oriental armyworm were evaluated. The results of bioassays indicated that most of these title compounds exhibit higher larvicidal activities than RH-5849, and several of them somewhat lower than the commercial insecticide tebufenozide. The larvicidal activities are strongly associated with the types and patterns of substitution on the benzene, and 3,5-dimethyl, 2-nitro-4-chloro, and 3-methyl derivatives are most prominent in increasing activity. Toxicity assays indicated that these derivatives could induce a premature, abnormal, and lethal larval moult. Here, we report the influence of nucleoside building blocks with different 2 0 -tethered modifications and show that they are compatible with RNAi function, D2 being superior. A new series of 5-nitrofuranes with relevant in vitro activity against Trypanosoma cruzi are described. Some of them act through a dual molecular mechanism, producing oxidative stress and inhibiting membrane sterol biosynthesis.",
