The routes of infection, in descending order of efficacy, were: i.c., i.n., s.c., i.p., i.v. and oral. Rats aged 1 and 2 weeks were generally similar in terms of mortality and mean time to death, regardless of inoculation route, except for the oral route, which had little effect. In comparison with the 1-and 2-week-old rats, the 4-week-old rats were less susceptible to the virus by all routes. Eight-week-old rats inoculated by the i.c., i.n. or s.c. routes died, but all those inoculated by other routes survived.",

Moreover, the time to death ranged from 4 to 12 days. Thus, doses as large as 2\u00d710 6 PFU by the i.p. and i.v. routes were without apparent effect, and doses of 2\u00d710 4 PFU by the i.n. and s.c. routes killed only a proportion of rats. By the i.c. route, a dose used for viral assay and two for immunohistochemistry (IHC). of 2\u00d710 3 PFU was still capable of killing all rats, but 200 PFU resulted in the death of only three of five animals. Deaths occurred within 4 to 11 days IHC of inoculation, but the mean time to death was greater in rats inoculated by the i.n. route than in The infected rats were perfused with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and Bouin's solution without those given s.c. or i.c. inoculation. acetic acid. Multiple sections of the brain and spinal cord were cut and embedded in paraffin wax. The Growth of Virus in Brain and Spinal Cord virus-specific antigen was detected in sections by the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (ABC) method, On the basis of the results of the previous experiment, 4-week-old rats were inoculated by the with a commercial ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). The sections were treated i.c. route with 2\u00d710 5 PFU of the virus. As shown in Fig. 1 , the virus was first detected in the brain sequentially with normal goat serum, anti-HEV mouse serum (1 in 1000), biotinylated goat anti-on day 1 after inoculation. The viral titres in the brain increased exponentially, reaching a max-mouse IgG, ABC reagent, and 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride 0\u00b705% and imum of more than 10 7 PFU/0\u00b72 g on day 3 to 4, at which time CNS signs developed. The virus was H 2 O 2 0\u00b71% in Tris buffer, pH 7\u00b76. The sections were counterstained with haematoxylin. The anti-first isolated from the spinal cord on day 2, and the infectivity titre had reached that of the brain HEV 67N mouse serum showed an antibody titre of 1028 by the haemagglutination inhibition test by day 4. No virus was detectable in the liver, spleen or blood of rats examined on days 1 to 4. (Hirano et al., 1990) . neuron groups were found in patches as shown in IHC Fig. 2 . On day 2, viral antigen was found in the Virus-specific antigen was first detected as cytolarge-sized neurons in the pons. On days 2 to 3, plasmic labelling in a few pyramidal cells of the the antigen-positive neurons increased in number cerebral cortex and of the hippocampus on day 1 and were distributed widely in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Fig. 3 shows many pyramidal after inoculation. In the hippocampus, positive cells with viral antigen in the cerebral cortex on were found in neurons of the lumbar dorsal root ganglion and in the right side of the spinal cord at an day 2. In the spinal cord, antigen-positive neurons were first found in ventral and dorsal horns in the early stage of infection; at a late stage of infection, specific antigen was found in the neurons of the cervical region. On day 3, antigen-positive cells were found in the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord, cerebral cortex, hippocampus and brainstem, and in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, but not in any as well as in the cervical spinal cord (Fig. 4) . On day 4, Purkinje cells in the cerebellum were also glial cells, including ependymal cells and cells of the choroid plexus (Hirano et al., 1998) . antigen-positive (Fig. 5) . Virus-specific antigen was not detected in the glial cells, ependymal cells or Our observations in rats indicate that, after i.c., footpad or sciatic nerve inoculation, HEV infects choroid plexus, or in the liver or spleen.",
