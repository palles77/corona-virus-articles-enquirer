            "text": "Interferons (IFNs) are a family of immunoregulatory cytokines with important roles in anti-viral and anti-tumor responses. Type I and II IFNs bind distinct receptors and are associated with different stages of the immune response. There is however, considerable crosstalk between these two cytokines with enhancement of IFNg responses following IFNa/b priming and loss of IFNa/b receptor (IFNAR) resulting in diminished IFNg responses. In this study, we sought to define the mechanism of crosstalk between the type I and II IFNs. Our previous reports demonstrated reduced expression of the canonically activated transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1, in cells lacking the IFNAR a chain (IFNAR1). Therefore, we used microarray analysis to determine whether reconstitution of STAT1 in IFNAR1-deficient cells was sufficient to restore IFNg responses. We identified several biological pathways, including the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway, in which STAT1 reconstitution was able to significantly rescue IFNgmediated gene regulation in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells. Notably, we also found that in addition to low basal expression of STAT1, cells lacking the IFNAR1 also had aberrant expression of multiple other transcription factors and signaling intermediaries. The studies described herein demonstrate that basal and regulated expression of signaling intermediaries is a mechanism for crosstalk between cytokines including type I and II IFNs.",

            "text": "The exposure of cells to cytokines, chemokines and other extracellular signals during pathogenic infection, injury and neoplasia allows for potent, and often synergistic, host immune responses. 1, 2 IFNs, a family of immunoregulatory cytokines with important roles in anti-pathogen and antitumor responses, can synergise with other stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) a and interleukin (IL) 1a for more potent immune responses. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Upon IFN binding, receptor-associated janus activated kinases (JAKs) are phosphorylated leading to activation of latent signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) molecules. Pivotal to IFN signaling is the transcription factor STAT1, the loss of which severely impairs IFN-dependent cellular responses. 11, 12 The canonical, JAK/STAT1-dependent IFNg signaling pathway has been extensively studied, however more recently alternate signaling pathways triggered by IFNg such as mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kB (NFkB) pathways have been identified. [13] [14] [15] [16] Although specific IFN family members bind to selective receptors and activate distinct signaling pathways, significant crosstalk between these pathways is evident. [1] [2] [3] 6, 17, 18 Pre-treatment of cells with low levels of type I IFNs (IFNa/b) leads to more potent response to type II IFN (IFNg) and interestingly loss of the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) results in diminished type II IFN responses. 19, 20 Although type I IFNs are secreted in abundance in response to viral infection, uninfected cells also constitutively secrete low concentrations of IFNa/b. [21] [22] [23] [24] Studies by our laboratory and others, show that cells unable to produce or respond to constitutive IFNa/b have attenuated STAT1 expression. This led to a model of cytokine crosstalk which postulates that priming levels of IFNb regulate STAT1 expression, which is important for mediating IFNg responses. 23, 25, 26 Moreover, we have demonstrated that reconstitution of STAT1 into Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells could restore IFNginduced STAT1 DNA binding and partially rescued IFNg-dependent anti-viral responses. 23 In this study we used global gene expression analysis to examine the contribution of STAT1 to the crosstalk between tonic IFNa/b and IFNg. Our data revealed that STAT1 alone regulates only a small proportion of IFN crosstalk. Moreover, loss of tonic IFNa/b signaling results in aberrant expression of numerous transcription factors and intracellular signaling molecules, thus tonic IFNa/b signaling regulates the expression of multiple signaling intermediaries involved in cytokine signaling.",

The 2106 genes with attenuated regulation by IFNg in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MEFs over the 6 hr time course of IFNg treatment were analyzed using Meta-CorZe's Genego. Genes with aberrant expression following IFNg treatment in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MEFs were involved in a diverse range of biological pathways, with the most significantly affected including developmental, immunological response, reproduction and apoptosis pathways (Fig 2A) . Surprisingly, only one pathway directly associated with STAT signaling was found among the 10 most significantly affected biological pathways. Subsequently, genes with attenuated regulation by IFNg in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MEFs were compared to the genes in which IFNg responses were significantly rescued by reconstitution of STAT1 using MetaCore's Genego comparative analysis for pathway maps. This analysis revealed, unsurprisingly, that among the 10 pathways most significantly affected by both the loss of IFNAR1 and reconstitution of STAT1 cells were the IFNa/b signaling pathway and multiple JAK/ STAT signaling pathways ( Fig. 2A ). Of the 10 most significantly affected pathways, 7 were associated with immune responses with the most significantly affected pathway being the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway ( Fig. 2A-B) . These data suggested that despite genes involved in a diverse array of biological responses pathways being aberrantly regulated by IFNg in the absence of IFNAR1, the pathways in which STAT1 reconstitution of IFNAR1 deficient cells rescued IFNg-mediated gene regulation were enriched for immune response pathways.",

This attenuated induction of PSMB9 was also evident in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MSCV cells following 6 hrs of IFNg treatment and importantly, was rescued to wild type equivalent levels in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 HA-STAT1 cells (Fig. 3C) .

We first examined expression of other members of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway known to be regulated by and involved in IFN signaling. In corroboration with our previous qRT-PCR findings, there was attenuated RNA expression of Stat1 and Stat2, but not Socs3, in unstimulated Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells, as determined by microarray and qRT-PCR analysis (Stat1 and Socs3) (Supp. Fig. 1A , Supp. Table 1 -2). 23 Similarly, we validated our previously identified decrease in basal STAT3 protein expression using primary C57BL/6 Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 MEFs and confirmed that the attenuated STAT3 protein expression evident in 129/C3H MEFs lacking IFNAR1 was related to a significant decrease in RNA expression (Supp. Fig. 1A-B ). 23 Given that both IFNg and IL-6 can activate STAT3 and that, IL-6 mediated STAT3 DNA binding is attenuated in the absence of IFNAR1, 27 we assessed STAT3 activation following IFNg or IL-6 treatment of Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells.

We had previous established that STAT1 reconstitution of Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells rescued IFNgdependent STAT1 activation and DNA binding and partially rescued IFNg-mediated protection from the cytopathic effects of ECMV. 23 Using microarray analysis to ascertain the effects of STAT1 reconstitution of IFNAR1-defient cells on a genome wide scale we found that although STAT1 is the canonical transcription factor activated by IFNg, only up to 15.4% and 3.2% of IFNg-dependent gene induction and repression were rescued by STAT1 respectively. Moreover, the ability of STAT1 to rescue IFNg responses diminished over time. The relatively minor effect of STAT1 expression of IFNg mediated gene repression was unsurprising however, as gene repression by IFNg is purported to be mediated via STAT1 independent pathways 34 such as CIITA mediated histone deacetylation. [35] [36] [37] Also, as STAT1 is induced by IFNg signaling, [38] [39] [40] it is plausible that at later time points de novo STAT1 production in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells in response to IFNg treatment was able to rescue the IFNg responsiveness of genes at later time points. Treatment of primary human fibroblasts with both IFNb and IFNg synergistically induces expression of genes involved in apoptosis and inflammatory responses. 41 Similarly, the biological response pathways which showed attenuated IFNg responses in Ifnar1 \u00a1/\u00a1 cells and for which STAT1 reconstitution significantly rescued IFNg responsiveness were both enriched for immune responses, apoptosis and alternate cytokine signaling pathways. As expected, our microarray and protein analysis indicated that IFNg-dependent regulation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway was significantly affected by the loss of tonic IFNa/b however, interestingly, the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway was the most sensitive to loss of IFNAR1 and was also significantly rescued by STAT1 reconstitution. Expression of a number of genes involved in MHC class I antigen presentation, including Tap1, Psmb9 and MHC class I heavy chain, are known to be mediated by type I and type II IFNs in a STAT1-dependent manner. 12, [42] [43] [44] [45] It was however surprising, given that this regulation is co-operatively mediated by other factors including IRF1, IRF2 and the ISGF3 complex for which basal expression was also reduced (Fig. 4 and Supp. Table 2), that STAT1 alone was able to rescue the IFNgdependent regulation of these genes.",

Mediation of cytokine crosstalk by the regulating the expression of signaling intermediaries has also been suggested for STAT4, 46, 47 IkB, 48 IRF9 49 and IRF2. 50 Our studies, which found that expression of over 100 transcription factors and numerous other signaling intermediaries, including Myd88, IKKg and MAPK kinases, were decreased in cells that lacked tonic IFNa/b, suggests that rather than being regulated by a single transcription factor or signaling complex, cytokine crosstalk likely involves regulation of the expression of a multitude of signaling molecules. This level of regulation may enhance specific biological responses when particular sets of transcription factors are involved. For example, although expression of STAT1 had a profound effect on IFNg dependent regulation of genes involved in antigen presentation, other IFNg-dependent responses, including regulation of genes involved in development and TLR-dependent immune responses, were not rescued by STAT1 reconstitution of Ifnar1 \u00a1/-MEFs. As RNA expression of the signaling intermediary Myd88, a fundamental component of the TLR signaling pathway, 51,52 was, like STAT1, attenuated in cells lacking constitutive IFNb signaling, it is plausible that tonic IFNa/ b augments TLR responsiveness by regulating the expression of Myd88. Moreover, as expression or activation of transcription factors involved in signaling via other cytokines known to engage in crosstalk with IFNa/b such as IL-6, IL-1 and TNFa 6,27,28,53-55 were also revealed by our studies to be attenuated in IFNAR1-deficient cells, it suggest that tonic IFNa/b also regulates responsiveness to these cytokines by this mechanism.",
