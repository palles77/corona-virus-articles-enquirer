To this category belong symptoms caused by histamine releasers, e.g. strawberries, where histamine release is not the consequence of an immunological reaction. In recent publications the term 'food idiosyncrasy' has been used in the sense of a non-immunological abnormal response to food. There is, however, increasing evidence that dietary protein intolerance may be mediated via an allergic reaction. In this chapter, the varieties of food protein intolerance in which there is some evidence for such an allergic reaction or reactions affecting the small intestine will be discussed.",

These antigens are called allergens when they produce symptoms in an allergic person. A child who has an allergy is distinguished from other children by an abnormal response on contact with an allergen or allergens, a response that does not occur when a non-allergenic child is exposed to the same allergen. The typical features of an allergic reaction are: first, the lack of any untoward reaction on the child's first exposure to the allergen; and second, that subsequent exposure to the allergen produces a hypersensitivity reaction. Indeed, Ferguson (1976) regards the term 'hypersensitivity' as preferable to the term 'allergy' when used to describe tissue damage resulting from the immune reaction to a further dose of antigen occurring in a previously immunized host. Gell and Coombs (1968) have classified the allergic or hypersensitivity reactions that may produce tissue damage of some kind into four types, as follows.",

            "text": "The role of cows' milk hypersensitivity in the genesis of sudden unexpected death or 'cot death' was raised by Parish et al. (1960) . The postulated mode of death was an acute anaphylactic reaction to cows' milk. Devey et al. (1976) , in Cambridge, went on to report that guinea-pigs given cows' milk to drink, instead of water, soon became anaphylactically sensitized to the proteins of cows' milk. Coombs, Devey and Anderson (1978) then found that when the drinking of cows' milk was continued by the guinea-pigs for more than 70 days they became refractory to the effect. Anderson et al. (1979) then showed that there were differences in the anaphylactic sensitizing capacities of different milks in their animal model. Evaporated whole cows' milk was practically without sensitizing capacity to beta lactoglobulin, and a formula in a liquid concentrate form had extremely low sensitizing capacity to both casein and beta lactoglobulin. In both cases this only occurred when given to the guinea-pigs by mouth, sensitizing capacity being retained when given parenterally. This suggests that these formula are handled differently in the small intestine from other milk feeds. These observations have far-reaching implications if they are true for human infants, because they suggest that modification of artificial feeding formulae may profoundly influence their allergenic or sensitizing capacity. This aspect is discussed further on page 154. Rudd, Manuel and Walker-Smith (1981) have described an acute anaphylactic reaction after feeding an infant with a wheat rusk. This infant did not have RAST antibody to wheat and his IgE was only marginally elevated to 17 iu ml\" 1 .",

The ability of such laboratories to accurately diagnose nine fish-allergic patients and nine controls who provided specimens of blood and hair for testing was assessed by Sethi et al. (1986) . All five laboratories were not only unable to diagnose fish allergy but reported many allergies in apparently non-allergenic subjects and also provided inconsistent results on duplicate samples from the same subject. Thus laboratory investigations appear to be most helpful when they are clinically least necessary, as history should give a clear indication of the diagnosis in most cases of quick onset syndromes. Sodium cromoglycate as an oral preparation (Nalcrom, Fisons Ltd.) has been reported to be an effective treatment for some cases of immediate food allergic disease. Symptoms provoked by ingestion of one or more foods may be prevented by sodium cromoglycate if it is taken before taking the food. The literature contains many anecdotal reports of the beneficial effect of this treatment of small numbers of patients at various ages (Freier and Berger, 1973; Watson and Timmins, 1979) , but larger studies are still awaited. Scepticism about the value of this drug has been based upon its failure to act on mucosal mast cells in the animal model (Pearce et al., 1982) . However, recent evidence that it has an effect on improving abnormal gastrointestinal sugar permeability in patients suggests its mode of action may be other than on the mast cell (Scotto et al., 1987) .",

            "text": "In some cases the children appear to develop food intolerance after an acute episode of gastroenteritis. The underlying causes of these temporary food intolerances of infancy probably relate to a transient sensitization of the child to dietary antigens, which may be a result of a breach of the mucosal barrier. The precise mechanisms which cause the enteropathy are unclear although the application of the Gell and Coombs classification of hypersensitivity reaction provides a basis for investigation. For the reactions to occur the offending food antigen must enter the mucosa in appropriate amounts to cause sensitization. There are two hypotheses regarding this process: one suggests sensitization caused from an overstimulation of the immune system by excess antigen entry, the other proposes a minimal entry of antigen sufficient to stimulate a reaginic response, which in turn leads to increased antigen entry leading to mucosal damage. In the experimental animal it has been shown that intestinal anaphylaxis can lead to increased uptake of intestinal luminal antigens (Walker et al., 1975) . Both hypotheses may be correct. Post-enteritis food sensitive enteropathies may result from excess local food antigen entry in susceptible individuals following gut damage induced by viral or bacterial pathogens. An hypothesis relating acute gastroenteritis and cows' milk sensitive enteropathy is illustrated in Figure 5 .3.",

            "text": "It is known from the observations of Gruskay and Cook (1955) that excess antigen absorption (in their studies egg albumin) occurs in infants with acute gastroenteritis. This has been well documented in animal studies of viral enteritis (Keljo, Butter and Hamilton, 1985) . Clinical studies have also shown increased entry of both small molecular weight sugars in acute gastroenteritis ( Figure 5 .4) (Ford et al., 1985) , and a larger molecular weight protein, horse radish peroxidase, in post-enteritis food sensitive enteropathies as observed using organ culture (Jackson, Walker-Smith and Phillips, 1983) . Thus direct and indirect evidence exists that damage to the small intestinal mucosa may result in a local increase in antigen entry. However, most children in whom this happens are not sensitized to food. Thus for this excessive antigen entry to be of pathogenic importance it must occur in susceptible individuals. The nature of such susceptibility remains to be established but clearly relates in part to impaired immunoregulation by the local defence mechanisms in the small intestinal mucosa. The local effect of excess antigen absorption may be also determined by the allergenicity of the antigen entering the mucosa, as suggested by the guinea-pig studies of Coombs and colleagues in Cambridge referred to earlier and supported by the clinical studies of Manuel, Walker-Smith and France (1979) . The role of cows' milk sensitive enteropathy as a cause of the post-enteritis syndrome is discussed further in Chapter 6.",

Cows' milk contains three times more protein than human milk (due to its higher content of casein), but has the same (Table 5 .2).

The pathogenetic role of circulating antibodies to cows' milk remains to be established. Lippard et al. (1936) showed that at whatever age a child first begins to drink cows' milk, cows' milk antigen and then cows' milk antibody can be detected in his blood. D\u00e9lire, Cambiaso and Masson (1978) have found that neonates fed on cows' milk have in their blood immune complexes containing cows' milk protein antigens, and IgG antibodies of maternal origin. Despite these findings, only a few children go on to develop cows' milk protein intolerance. How such a state of clinical intolerance develops is unknown. Even the presence of a high level of serum anti-milk antibodies is not necessarily associated with damage, e.g. there is a high incidence of elevated titres of cows' milk antibodies in children with both coeliac disease and kwashiorkor (Chandra, 1976) yet, as a rule, these children improve clinically on cows' milk diet. As stated earlier the local reaction in the small intestine may be mediated via one of the allergic reactions as classified by Gell and Coombs (1968) , namely type I, type III, and type IV. Evidence that these three types of reaction may occur in children with cows' milk protein intolerance include the following observations. First, in relation to type I reaction, elevated titres of IgE antibodies to cows' milk protein, have been observed in some children with enteropathy but are more typical of quick reactors. However, such elevated titres can also be found in milk tolerant children. Positive skin prick tests may be found in milk intolerant children but, again, correlation with symptoms is variable. The involvement of IgE in the immunological response of the lamina propria to milk challenge in children with cows' milk protein intolerance has been described by Shiner and her colleagues (1975) , also by Kilby, Walker-Smith and Wood (1976) , who showed an increase in IgE cell numbers in the small intestinal mucosa after a milk challenge in a child with cows' milk sensitive enteropathy. However, whether IgE mediated small intestinal disease due to sensitized mast cells releasing mediators at the site of reaction between cows' milk protein, and reaginic IgE antibody fixing to mast cells really occurs, has not yet been proved. If this does happen, disodium cromoglycate may help.",

Manuel et al. (1981) showed a remarkable difference in the incidence of delayed recovery between infants fed with different formulae immediately after an acute attack of gastroenteritis. Old formula Pregestimil (high osmolality and based on a casein hydrolysate) and Al 110 (based on casein) and standard SMA (a conventional adapted formula) were compared for infants aged under 6 months. It is likely that delayed recovery in these circumstances is related to cows' milk sensitive enteropathy; 26% of infants fed with the casein formula Al 110 developed delayed recovery compared with only 5% with Pregestimil and the very low figure of 2.5% with SMA. This later figure may have been by chance unusually low. Nevertheless, when these milks are tested in an animal model (guinea-pigs) then similar results are found: Al 110 is sensitizing, Pregestimil not sensitizing at all and SMA sensitizing significantly less often (McLaughlan and Coombs, 1983; Manuel et al., 1979) . Thus adapted feeding formulae appear to be much less sensitizing than the older infant feeding formula still routinely used in much of the developing world. This is consistent with the decline in the severity of cows' milk sensitive enteropathy in societies where such milks are now universally used. Thus the allergenicity of the milk formula fed at the time of an acute attack of gastroenteritis may be a central factor in the development of cows' milk sensitive enteropathy.",

In those earlier reports the majority of infants were less than 3 months of age at the onset of symptoms (Harrison et al., 1976; Walker-Smith, Kilby and France, 1978) . In the more recent study of Digeon et al. (1986) the mean age of onset was 7 months and some patients were over 1 year at the age of presentation. This change may relate to the fact that for the first 6 months of life most infants were fed modern adapted formulae, whereas in the previous reports infants were fed old-fashioned partly modified milks. The onset of symptoms usually occurred at a time when infants were having ordinary pasteurized (doorstep) milk. As referred to earlier, it seems likely that modern adapted milks are less sensitizing, and there is both animal model (Coombs and McLaughlin, 1985) and clinical evidence to support this view. There is usually a latent interval between the introduction of cows' milk and the onset of symptoms. Such an onset may be clinically indistinguishable from acute gastroenteritis. Indeed the illness may begin with acute gastroenteritis and then after return to a cows' milk feeding the diarrhoea becomes persistent. Lactose intolerance may also be present. Whatever the mode of onset of symptoms most often at the time of diagnosis these infants have chronic diarrhoea and failure to thrive. Cows' milk sensitive enteropathy is a most important cause of the syndrome of chronic diarrhoea and failure to thrive in infancy. The mode of presentation of 18 infants at time of diagnosis seen at Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children is illustrated in Table 5 .4.",

It is also now clear that children may take longer than 48 hours to relapse after a milk challenge. Finally, positive challenges do not always have a similar onset, duration and clinical features. The use of these rigorous criteria has probably led to under-diagnosis of this syndrome. Serial small intestinal biopsies taken first at the time of initial presentation, and second after the return of symptoms following a milk challenge, now permit a firm diagnosis to be made on the basis of one diagnostic milk challenge.",

Such children may then be described as having a milk elimination responsive enteropathy. The transient nature of this disorder as well as the desire to avoid early milk challenge (because of the potential risk of acute anaphylaxis) (de Peyer and Walker-Smith, 1979) leads in practice to a late milk challenge at the age of 9 months to 1 year or even later. These children may then no longer be milk intolerant at the time of milk challenge (i.e. at the age of 9-12 months). Milk provocation in such circumstances merely establishes the safe return of cows' milk into the diet.

Should symptoms recur, such as vomiting and diarrhoea, evidence of an intercurrent infection, e.g. hospital acquired rotavirus gastroenteritis, should be sought, i.e. stools should be sent for rapid viral diagnosis. If viral gastroenteritis is excluded, it is only a biopsy that can establish whether a relapse has occurred and should be done as soon as possible. If the previously normal mucosa is now abnormal, then this is regarded as a positive challenge, i.e. a cows' milk sensitive enteropathy has been shown and a firm diagnosis of cows' milk protein intolerance is made. If the mucosa is still normal, he continues on milk, and other causes for the symptoms are sought, such as an intercurrent illness, e.g. urinary tract infection or other infection. An occasional child may clinically relapse after a milk challenge despite a normal biopsy in the absence of any other explanation. This poses a difficult problem in diagnosis and may be due to patchiness of the cows' milk sensitive enteropathy. The symptoms that occur after challenge vary considerably and range from an alarming anaphylactic reaction that comes on rapidly after the child has ingested cows' milk, to the development of diarrhoea, with stools obviously blood-stained 24 or more hours after exposure to milk protein (Table  5 .6). Vomiting is usually a striking symptom and is often the first to appear.",

Goldman and his colleagues in 1963 reported investigations of 89 children with cows' milk protein intolerance and found the following frequencies of reactions to challenge with various milk protein fractions: beta-lactoglobulin, 66%; casein, 57%; alpha-lactalbumin, 54%; bovine serum albumin, 51%. In addition to the above challenge procedure, related to small intestinal biopsy, various laboratory tests have been studied to help to diagnose cows' milk protein intolerance. Anderson and Schloss in the USA in 1923 found antibodies to cows' milk protein in the serum of infants exposed to cows' milk. Since then the occurrence of circulating milk precipitins in the serum of children has been reported in a wide variety of disorders, including chronic respiratory disease and Ig A deficiency. However, most authorities believe that the presence of circulating milk antibodies cannot be correlated with clinical intolerance to this protein. A good example of this is provided by some children with coeliac disease who still have cows' milk antibodies in their sera whilst in remission on a gluten-free diet with no symptoms related to milk ingestion. Some observers, e.g. Matthews and Soothill (1970) , have studied complement activation after milk challenge. Five children with gastrointestinal symptoms due to milk protein intolerance had evidence of complement activation after milk challenge with 5 ml of milk. However, assay of complement activity after milk challenge has not been adopted as a useful laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis of cows' milk allergy.",

In a classic paper, Liu, Tsao and Moore, in 1967 , showed that challenge with cows' milk protein could induce intestinal malabsorption of lactose in children who were intolerant to cows' milk protein. It is now clear that lactase deficiency with secondary lactose intolerance may be produced by cows' milk challenge in children who have cows' milk sensitive enteropathy, particularly when this has occurred as a sequel to acute gastroenteritis. This secondary lactase deficiency is a consequence of mucosal damage produced by cows' milk protein per se {see Figure 5 .1) (Harrison, 1974; Harrison et al., 1976) .",

This sometimes is due to glucose polymer intolerance (see Chapter 7). In a study comparing a casein hydrolysate and a whey hydrolysate, whilst both were effective, weight gain and healing of the mucosa was better in some cases fed a whey hydrolysate. However, the latter formula was more unpalatable Walker-Smith, Digeon and Phillips, 1987) . Only those formulae that are nutritionally complete (if necessary with vitamin supplementation) are to be recommended. Those with a low osmolality should be chosen for young infants or infants with small intestinal disease. It is important to ensure that both liquid and solid feeds are free of cows' milk proteins. Lactose intolerance may accompany the protein intolerance, and in such circumstances lactose should also be withdrawn from the diet. The necessity for dietary treatment is always temporary, and reintroduction of a normal diet is normally nearly always possible between the age of 1 and 2 years. This may be done in the home, but a history of previous severe reactions, such as urticaria or anaphylactoid shock, is an absolute indication for reintroduction of a normal diet under very close medical supervision usually in hospital. When a repeat biopsy is done to assess mucosal healing before challenge, clearly this will be done in hospital, which the author recommends on most occasions. Usually this shows significant improvement. Because of the risk of anaphylaxis milk challenge is usually delayed to the age of 9-12 months.",

Chemotaxis is the ability of certain cells to move or to turn towards other cells or substances that exert a chemical influence (positive chemotaxis) or away from them (negative chemotaxis). All infants showed a significant decrease in chemotaxis at a time when the disease was active. However, this depression did not relate to the severity of the protein intolerance as judged by symptoms or the nutritional status. Random migration of neutrophils was increased in patients with active protein intolerance as compared with controls. The relationship of this observation to pathogenesis is unclear at present. Kuitunen et al. (1975) who described the clinical findings in 54 children with cows' milk intolerance reported that 35 of these children were given soya protein as a cows' milk substitute. Four of these developed soya protein intolerance. The symptoms were vomiting, diarrhoea and weight loss. Three had partial villous atrophy on biopsy and the fourth had a flat mucosa. It is clear that soy sensitive enteropathy may occur as a sequel to cows' milk sensitive enteropathy.",

The precise criteria necessary to establish the existence of any form of transient intolerance to a dietary substance are indicated in diagrammatic form in Figure 5 . 12. McNeish et al. (1976) , in fact, have demonstrated such early evidence of gluten toxicity by serial xylose absorption studies at the time of an early gluten challenge in an infant with an enteropathy who had previously responded to a gluten-free diet. Serial biopsies were not used to establish gluten toxicity at that time in their infant, but the mucosa has been shown to be normal 2 years after return to a normal gluten-containing diet. At the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, a child has been observed who completely fulfils both the ESPGAN and McNeish criteria for the diagnosis of transient gluten intolerance (see Table 5 .8) . This child had an early gluten challenge at age of 1 year 2 months, having previously had a flat mucosa and a clinical response to a gluten-free diet. She relapsed clinically and histologically with gluten. Subsequently, after a second challenge with gluten, she has remained clinically well and her mucosa 2 years 3 months after return to a normal glutencontaining diet has remained normal. She has now left the paediatric age group symptom free. It thus seems clear that this child had transient gluten intolerance from which she has now recovered (see Table 5 .7). Thus application of these very strict criteria has established evidence that transient gluten intolerance does in fact exist in this very small number of patients.",

There are, however, a few reports to suggest that it may take more than 2 years for a relapse in some exceptional cases of coeliac disease. McNicholl et al. (1974) described two children who took more than 2 years to relapse after return to a normal gluten-containing diet. Only one case has had the full clinical details published (Egan-Mitchell, Fottrell and McNicholl, 1978) . In that case the intra-epithelial lymphocyte count rose and disaccharidase activities fell before frank mucosal relapse. A survey by the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition suggested that others had a similar experience (Shmerling, 1978) .",

This represents the total number of children diagnosed at Queen Elizabeth Hospital between 1972 and 1986. They have now been followed up for a period of 8-10 years in most cases but in one for 20 years. Many of these children had gluten introduced into their diet at an early age as did children with coeliac disease diagnosed at the same time. All had normal biopsies 2 years or more after a return to a normal gluten containing diet. Four had further biopsies. One was abnormal and thus this child has coeliac disease. He had in fact been symptom free, the indication for biopsy being the development of serum gliadin antibodies. Nussl\u00e9 et al. (1978) have described a similar group of six children, initially diagnosed as having coeliac disease, who have had a normal small intestinal mucosa 2h-^h years after reintroduction of gluten to their diet. All had normal IEL levels, and all except one, normal disaccharidases. Thus, again, these children appear to have had transient gluten intolerance from which they have recovered. Schmitz, Jos and Rey (1978) , from Paris, in a very important paper have described three children who had earlier responded to a gluten-free diet but who then developed flat mucosa on a gluten-containing diet at the ages of 10 years, 62 years and 4 years 8 months respectively. However, they did not return to a gluten-free diet but continued on a gluten-containing diet. Further biopsies after more than 9 years, 12 years and 5 years respectively on a normal gluten containing diet, showed surprisingly normal or near normal mucosae. The third case was having a low gluten intake but had relapsed earlier on a similar low gluten diet. Thus these three children appear to have recovered spontaneously on a gluten-containing diet. A further seven children have since been described (Schmitz et al., 1984) . The author would regard this as good evidence that these children had transient gluten intolerance which was longer lasting than other children described from which they had recovered, but Schmitz, Jos and Rey have raised the possibility that the mucosal lesion of coeliac disease may disappear during adolescence only to reappear in adulthood.",

Thus most children previously diagnosed on firm criteria as suffering from coeliac disease but who fail to relapse by 2 years after a return to a gluten-containing diet can be provisionally labelled as transient gluten intolerance. In each individual child, however, follow-up must be close in order to detect the occasional child who eventually has a late relapse and thus proves in the end to have coeliac disease, i.e. permanent gluten intolerance. From all these studies it is clear that there is thus a particular need for detailed and long-term follow-up into adult life of these children retrospectively diagnosed as transient gluten intolerance. It is therefore difficult to regard the diagnosis of transient gluten intolerance in our present state of knowledge as ever being any more than provisional and it cannot be regarded as final. It remains possible that any or all of the children referred to above ultimately may relapse after many years in adult life.

It has been discussed here at some length, not because of the intrinsic importance of transient gluten intolerance itself, but rather because of the importance of distinguishing the condition from coeliac disease. If it were not for the existence of a permanent gluten intolerance this disorder would be looked upon much the same as cows' milk and soy intolerance.",

In this latter study all infants also were cows' milk intolerant and were under the age of 6 months at the time of diagnosis. These findings are of more theoretical importance than practical as the author would not advocate in clinical practice serial biopsy and challenge if a child with an enteropathy who responds to milk elimination develops diarrhoea in the absence of infection when given one of these foods. Rather, the offending food would be removed from the diet. What is important is that there is now firm evidence that these food sensitive enteropathies do exist in infancy.",
