Long-lived winter bees had the highest bacterial loads and the lowest 33 community \u03b1-diversity, with a characteristic shift towards high levels of Bartonella and 34 Commensalibacter, and a reduction of opportunistic colonizers. Using gnotobiotic bee 35 experiments, we show that diet is a major contributor to the observed differences in 36 bacterial loads. Overall, our study reveals that the gut microbiota of winter bees is 37 remarkably different from foragers and nurses.

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/703512 doi: bioRxiv preprint 42 The European honey bee, Apis mellifera, is an important pollinator species for natural 43 ecosystems and agricultural production [1]. Its health status is threatened by numerous 44 factors including habitat loss, pesticide exposure, and high parasite and pathogen loads [2-45 4]. Accumulating evidence suggests that the gut microbiota of adult honey bees plays a 46 critical role for bee health [5]. The bee microbiota converts dietary compounds [6, 7] and 47 produces short chain fatty acids [8] in the gut, enhances sucrose responsiveness of the host 48 [8], and stimulates the immune system [9, 10]. Moreover, disruption of the gut microbiota 49 composition by antibiotic treatment, pesticide exposure, or dietary manipulations has 50 been associated with increased pathogen loads resulting in increased host mortality [11-51 14]. 52 A striking feature of the honey bee gut microbiota is its low taxonomic complexity. In 53 worker bees, the community is dominated by less than ten phylotypes (i.e. clusters of 54 strains sharing \u226597% sequence identity in the 16S rRNA gene), which typically make up 55 >95% of the bacterial cells in the gut [5, 15-18]. These phylotypes have been consistently 56 detected in honey bees, regardless of geographic location, life stage, or season [16, 19, 20], 57 and are acquired horizontally through contact with nest mates and hive components [21]. 58 They include five core phylotypes (Gilliamella, Snodgrassella, Lactobacillus Firm-4 and 59 Firm-5, and Bifidobacterium), which are typically present in every adult worker bee, and a 60 number of non-core phylotypes, e.g. Frischella, Bartonella, Commensalibacter, or 61 Bombella, which are prevalent across colonies, but not necessarily present in every bee 62 [22]. Additional phylotypes have been detected, including Lactobacillus kunkeii, Serratia Page 4 of 44 marcescens and other Enterobacteriaceae, or Apibacter, but they typically account for a 64 relatively small proportion of the bee gut microbiota [23]. 65 While many of these phylotypes are consistently present in adult worker bees, their 66 abundance can vary across bees, and may differentially impact the host physiology. 67 Particularly, the type and amount of nutrients (i.e. pollen and nectar) available during the 68 foraging season can have profound effects on the composition of the gut microbiota and 69 may alter its metabolic activity [24]. Likewise, distinct dietary habits or variation in lifespan 70 of worker bees during summer and winter may influence gut microbiota composition. From 71 spring to autumn, young worker bees (nurses) stay inside the hive to take care of larvae, 72 and feed on nutrient-rich pollen, whereas older worker bees become foragers that feed on 73 nectar and honey to fuel their energy-expensive flights [25]. In late autumn, newly emerged 74 adult worker bees become winter bees (also called 'diutinus') that have an extended 75 lifespan (~6 months) and that ensure the colony survival during the cold winter season in 76 the absence of brood [26]. These bees form a tight cluster for thermoregulation inside the 77 hive, feed strictly on food stores (pollen, beebread, and honey) and retain their feces all 78 winter [27], which is likely to impact the ecology of their gut microbiota. 79 A number of studies have looked at the gut microbiota composition of different worker bee 80 types or throughout seasons, with the overall conclusion that the community composition 81 is relatively stable [19, 28-31]. However, previous studies were mostly based on 82 comparative analyses of relative community member abundance using 16S rRNA amplicon 83 sequencing. Such analysis cannot provide insights about the extent or directionality of 84 changes in taxa abundance, especially if microbial loads vary substantially between 85 samples [32]. In fact, a change in the total abundance of the microbiota could by itself be 86 .",

An example is the experimental exposure of bees to 88 antibiotics which did not result in a strong shift in the relative composition, but in an overall 89 reduction of bacterial load, rendering bees more susceptible to pathogen invasion [11] . In 90 addition to the limitations of current studies using relative abundance data, almost nothing 91 is known about the gut microbiota of winter bees as compared to foragers or nurses. This 92 is surprising, as winter bees are critical for colony health and survival during the cold season 93 of the year, when resources are limited and most colony losses occur [33, 34] . 94 Characterizing the gut microbiota of winter bees and identifying factors that shape its 95 community composition may help to understand the physiological adaptations that honey 96 bees need to survive the cold season in temperate regions. In this study, we used qPCR and 97 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to assess differences in the gut microbiota of nurses, 98 foragers, and winter bees. We analyzed bacterial loads of major community members in 99 566 individual worker bees sampled from a single hive over two years. We then expanded 100 our analysis to the entire community and analyzed pooled samples from 14 different hives 101 to test if similar community changes occur in winter bees across hives. Finally, we 102 performed experiments with gnotobiotic bees to test the influence of diet on differences 103 in gut microbiota composition. Our study reveals major differences in total bacterial load 104 and in the abundance of specific gut community members in the gut microbiota of nurses, 105 foragers, and winter bees and identifies dietary pollen as a major contributing factor.

These bees were used to determine seasonal changes in the absolute 111 abundance of seven major community members of the honey bee gut microbiota using qPCR and to determine the overall community structure by 16S rRNA community analysis. 129 Bees were anesthetized with CO2 for 10 s and the gut including crop, midgut, hindgut, and Microbiota-depleted bees were generated and colonized as described in Ke\u0161nerov\u00e1 et al. 142 [6]. The treatment group of bees fed on pollen and sugar water was the same as in the 143 previous study. The other treatment group (bees fed on sugar water only) was carried out 144 in parallel with the same batch of bees. Bees were fed ad libitum with sterilized bee pollen 145 (P) and sterilized sugar water (SW, 50% sucrose, w/v) (SW+P treatment), or with only 146 sterilized sugar water (SW treatment). Bees were sampled 10 days after colonization and 147 the guts were dissected as described before. with the Nucleospin PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) according to the 154 manufacturer's instructions and the resulting DNA was used for qPCR.

In contrast, forager bees seem to have 326 more even community compositions (Fig. 1B) .

            "text": "Performing universal 16S rRNA qPCR, we found that total bacterial loads differed between 348 the three bee types across the sampled hives. Both winter bees and nurses had higher 349 bacterial loads than foragers ( Fig. 2A , Permutation ANOVA P=1e-4, followed by Tukey HSD 350 test, P=5.1e-9 and 1.66e-6 respectively) confirming our previous results from the single 351 hive. Winter bees also showed a trend towards higher bacterial loads than nurses, but this 352 difference was not statistically significant ( Fig. 2A The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/703512 doi: bioRxiv preprint Page 18 of 44 4A). Therefore, while the gut communities of the three bee types differed from each other, 379 they seemed to be similarly variable among each other. 380 We next assessed differences in the absolute abundance of individual community members 381 to reveal the directionality of community changes. We first looked at the seven phylotypes 382 that were monitored by qPCR over two years (Fig. 2E) . Consistent with our previous results 383 (Fig. 1C) , Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus Firm4, Lactobacillus Firm5, and Bartonella had 384 increased levels (Permutation ANOVA on three groups P=1e-4, followed by Tukey, P<2e-4), 385 while Frischella had decreased levels in winter bees compared to foragers (Fig. 2E , 386 Permutation ANOVA p=2e-04 followed by Tukey HSD test P=2.79e-3). The only two 387 phylotypes showing abundance patterns inconsistent with the results from the two year 388 sampling were Snodgrassella and Gilliamella. Snodgrassella did not experience any 389 differences in absolute abundance (Fig. 2E , Permutation ANOVA P=1.87e-1), illustrating 390 that a proportional change in the community, as found when looking at the relative 391 community composition (Fig. 2D) , does not necessarily imply a change in abundance. When 392 comparing nurses and winter bees, only Bartonella and Frischella showed differences in 393 their absolute abundance. While Bartonella had markedly increased levels, Frischella 394 abundance went down in winter bees as compared to nurses ( Figure 2E) . We confirmed 395 these changes by carrying out qPCR on the same samples with the phylotype-specific 396 primers used for the monthly sampling as presented above (Supplementary Fig. S5 ). Except 397 for Lactobacillus Firm5, which showed a significant difference between nurses and winter 398 bees in the qPCR but not in the amplicon sequencing data, the results of the two 399 approaches were surprisingly congruent corroborating our conclusion that the microbiota 400 of nurses, foragers, and winter bees markedly differs in the composition of these seven 401 major community members.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/703512 doi: bioRxiv preprint 428 One of the drivers of the observed differences in bacterial load and community 429 composition between winter bees, foragers, and nurses could be diet. Dietary differences 430 between the three types of bees were evident from visual inspection of the dissected guts 431 (Fig. 3A-C) . The rectums of winter bees and nurses appeared yellow indicating the presence 432 of pollen, while those of foragers were translucent. Moreover, the wet weight of the guts 433 was significantly different between the three types of bees (ANOVA F(2,68) = 24.13, P=1.21e-434 8), with foragers having on average two times lighter guts than nurses (Tukey HSD test 435 P=1.14e-6) and winter bees (Tukey HSD test P=6.81e-8) (Fig. 3D) . When plotting normalized 436 16S rRNA gene copy numbers as a function of gut weight, we found that gut weight 437 positively correlated with total microbiota abundances across the three bee types (Fig. 3E) . 438 In order to demonstrate that pollen diet is directly associated with increased bacterial loads 439 in honey bees, we experimentally colonized newly emerged bees with a community of 11 440 bacterial strains representing the seven major bacterial phylotypes of the bee gut 441 microbiota [6]. The colonized bees were kept in the laboratory for ten days and fed ad 442 libitum either sterile sugar water and pollen (SW+P treatment), or sugar water only (SW 443 treatment). We found a significant difference in gut weight between the two treatments 444 (Fig. 3F, Welch's T-Test t=9.433, P=1.452e-11) . While the gut weights of the bees of the SW 445 treatment were comparable to those of forager bees, the gut weights of the bees of the 446 SW+P treatment were markedly higher, exceeding even those of winter bees (Fig. 3D &   447   3F ). We observed a positive correlation between gut weight and microbiota abundance for 448 both the experimentally colonized bees in the laboratory (Fig. 3G) worker bees sampled from the hive (Fig. 3E) . Moreover, differences in bacterial loads of 450 individual community members between the two experimental treatments mirrored, to a 451 large extent, the differences found between nurses, foragers, and winter bees: most 452 phylotypes were more abundant in bees fed pollen as compared to bees fed sugar water 453 only (Fig. 3H, (Fig. 3H) , its abundance was higher in winter bees and nurses as compared to 456 foragers ( Fig. 2A) . Notably, Bartonella was able to colonize only 75% of all bees when pollen 457 was absent. The dependence on pollen for gut colonization was even more pronounced for 458 Frischella. Less than 50% of the experimentally colonized bees of the SW treatment had 459 detectable levels of Frischella, and the loads in bees that were colonized were relatively 460 low. In contrast, bees of the SW+P treatment were all colonized and had relatively high and 461 consistent loads of Frischella (Fig. 3H) . 462 Taken together, these results show that a pollen diet leads to an increase in gut weight and 463 overall bacterial load providing a plausible explanation for some of the differences in the 464 loads observed between foragers, nurses, and winter bees. in winter bees. These differences in community structure were found across fourteen 475 different colonies and in three different years, suggesting that the \"reconfiguration\" of the 476 microbiota in winter bees is a conserved feature in colonies in Western Switzerland. 477 However, regional differences in floral diversity [24] or climate may influence this pattern.

For example, in our study, the relative abundance of Snodgrassella went down in 490 winter bees as compared to foragers and nurses (Fig. 2D) . However, this effect was not due 491 to a decrease of the total number of Snodgrassella, but rather an increase of other 492 community members as identified by qPCR. In fact, the total abundance of Snodgrassella 493 remained the same in foragers, nurses, and winter bees (Fig. 2E) analyzing microbial communities, as changes in absolute abundance -but not necessarily 498 relative abundance -may change the impact of a given bacterium on its environment.",

In addition, pollen is a more nutrient-rich diet than 523 nectar, honey, or sucrose offering a larger diversity of different metabolic niches for gut 524 bacteria. Both factors are likely to contribute to the increased bacterial loads in bees fed 525 on pollen as compared to those fed on sugar water only. Recent reports in mice and fly 526 models have shown that an increase in nutritional richness, especially protein quantity, is 527 associated with an increase in overall abundance of the microbiota but a decrease in \u03b1-528 diversity [58, 59] . This is supported by our findings, because we observed an increase in 529 bacterial loads and a decrease in effective number of species in nurses and winter bees 530 that feed on pollen ( Fig. 2A and 2B) . Consistently, most of the phylotypes that increased in 531 total abundance (Lactobacillus Firm5, Lactobacillus Firm4, Bifidobacterium, Bartonella) are 532 located in the rectum, which is the last part of the hindgut where pollen accumulates until 533 bees defecate. In line with this, a previous report showed that the abundances of total However, not all changes observed in winter bees could be recapitulated in our 543 colonization experiment. For example, the differences observed in Bartonella levels 544 between foragers, nurses, and winter bees (Fig. 2E) were not observed in the experimental 545 bees that were fed with or without pollen (Fig. 3H) . Another example is Frischella. While Winter bees feed on pollen that has been stored in the hive for several weeks to months. 561 It has previously been shown that the consumption of an aged pollen-diet affects the gut 562 microbiota composition of nurses [12] . It will be important to characterize metabolic 563 differences between the pollen diet of winter and summer bees and to associate such Beside the increase of Commensalibacter and Bartonella, another intriguing characteristic 595 of the winter bee gut microbiota was the disappearance of minor, non-core community 596 members in the bee gut microbiota. We can exclude that these differences in community 597 composition are due to a community sampling bias, because nurses had similar bacterial 598 loads as winter bees, but showed the opposite trend in respect to the presence of minor 599 community members. We hypothesize that these minor community members are transient 600 colonizers that cannot persist in the bee gut environment over longer periods of time and 601 hence disappear in old winter bees. As some of these bacteria, e.g. Serratia or Klebsiella, 602 present potential pathogens of bees, there may be also mechanisms in place that increase All scripts and datasets will be deposited to Zenodo upon acceptance.

During the foraging season, we sampled foragers returning to the hive entrance with 113 pollen on their legs, while during the cold winter months, we sampled winter bees on top 114 of the frames from inside the hive.

For 565 example, Commensalibacter and Bartonella, the two community members that increased 566 the most in winter bees, carry out aerobic respiration, while most of the other microbiota 567 members are saccharolytic fermenters [22, 68]. Notably, winter bees retain their feces in 568 the gut for extended periods of time, which is likely to affect the physico-chemical 569 conditions and the availability of nutrients in the gut. Moreover, in the absence of 570 defecation, bacteria may accumulate over time in the gut of winter bees, while in nurses 571 or foragers more frequent defecation may result in a faster turnover of the microbiota. 572 Together with differences in the body temperature of bees -in winter it is at ~21\u00b0C and in 573 summer at ~35\u00b0C [69] -this may influence bacterial growth rates. Indeed, in a recent 574 metagenomic study, it was shown that gut bacteria have lower average population 575 replication in old winter bees as compared to young nurse bees, which is indicative of 576 decreased replication rates [18]. Another important point to consider, when carrying our 577non-culture based community analysis is that these methods usually cannot discriminate 578 between dead and live bacterial cells.

In the case of 586 Snodgrassella, it is interesting to note that the levels of Snodgrassella barely changed 587 across worker bee type or the two diet treatments in the experiment. This suggests that 588 the colonization of Snodgrassella is not modulated by the dietary state, the 589 physicochemical conditions in the gut, or the abundance of other community members.
