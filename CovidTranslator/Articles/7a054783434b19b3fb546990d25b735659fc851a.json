While an RNA stemloop structure (the \"HIV-1 Frameshift Stimulating Signal\", or HIV-1 FSS) controls the frameshift efficiency and has been hypothesized as an attractive therapeutic target, developing compounds that selectively bind this RNA and interfere with HIV-1 replication has proven challenging. Building on our prior discovery of a \"hit\" molecule able to bind this stem-loop, we now report the development of compounds displaying high affinity for the HIV-1 FSS. These compounds are able to enhance frameshifting more than 50% in a dual-luciferase assay in human embryonic kidney cells, and they strongly inhibit the infectivity of pseudotyped HIV-1 virions.",

            "text": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), remains a significant challenge to global health. 1, 2 Since its initial identification in 1983, HIV-1 infection has reached the status of a pandemic. In 2009 alone, there were approximately 2.7 million new infections and about 2.0 million deaths from AIDS related causes. 3 Currently there is no cure for HIV-1 infection. While progression of the disease can be controlled by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a combination of drugs designed to inhibit different stages in the virus' life cycle, 4 the complexity of the HAART regimen, and the ability of the virus to evolve resistance suggest that alternative drug targets for HIV-1 treatment and prophylaxis are needed. 5 One potentially attractive target for pharmacological interference in the HIV-1 life cycle is the virus' requirement for a programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshift (\u22121 PRF) in order to express its enzymes. 6 Ribosomal frameshifting is a recoding mechanism common among viruses with polycistronic (multiple open reading frames, or ORFs, in a single gene) genomes. It allows viruses to translate polypeptides in different ORFs by avoiding the stop codon(s) present in the single mRNA transcript. In HIV-1, the pol gene is in the \u22121 reading frame with respect to gag. Gag, the precusor of the viral structural proteins, is produced via normal translational rules, while Pol, the precursor of the viral enzymes, is synthesized as a fused Gag-Pol polyprotein via \u22121 PRF. This occurs with a frequency of 5\u221210% of ribosomes translating the full-length viral mRNA. A critical molar ratio of Gag-Pol to Gag protein is required for HIV-1 replication and infectivity; alterations to this ratio have been shown to be detrimental. 7 \u22121 PRF in HIV-1 is controlled by two cis acting mRNA elements: a heptameric slippery sequence (U UUU UUA), with the 0 frame indicated by spaces and where the frameshift actually occurs, and a downstream two-stem helix immediately following the slippery sequence, also known as the frameshift stimulatory signal (HIV-1 FSS, Figure 1 ). 8 While several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the frameshift, 9 it is currently hypothesized that this event results from an incomplete translocation for a limited number of ribosomes, due to resistance of the FSS to unwinding. 10\u221212 These ribosomes then start translation of pol in the new \u22121 reading frame. Modification of the slippery site or stimulatory sequence (either via natural variation or laboratory mutations) in ways affecting frameshifting efficiency translates to a decrease in viral replication. 13, 14 These and other results have led several groups to propose \u22121 PRF as a potential target for developing antiretroviral agents for HIV-1. 6,15\u221217 NMR structural analyses indicate that the HIV-1 FSS RNA consists of a G-C rich upper stem-loop structure, 18 separated from a flexible lower stem by a GGA trinucleotide bulge ( Figure 1 ). 19, 20 The bulge produces a roughly 60\u00b0bend between the upper and lower stems. The upper stem-loop is exceptionally stable. This stability is believed to play a vital role in the stimulation of the frameshift, since the ribosome must unwind the stem during translation. The lower stem is thermodynamically less stable. The highly structured ACAA tetraloop is uncommon among tetraloops 21 but is conserved among all HIV-1 group M subtypes except the uncommon H and J subtypes. Likewise, the heptameric slippery sequence is conserved across all HIV-1 group M subtypes. SHAPE analysis of the intact HIV genome suggests a more complex structure for the FSS RNA, although the upper stem-loop is retained. 22, 23 Since other viruses also rely on frameshifting, 24 targeting frameshift-regulating structures may have general utility beyond the context of HIV. For example, human T-cell leukemia virus type 2 (HTLV-2) uses two \u22121 PRF events similar to HIV-1 in order to synthesize fused Gag-Pro and Gag-Pro-Pol precursor proteins. 25 The RNA responsible for the \u22121 PRF essential for expression of Gag-Pro in HTLV-2 also consists of two cis-acting RNA elements, a heptanucleotide (AAAAAAC) slippery site and a stem-loop shown in Figure 1 . 26 This HTLV-2 FSS served as a sequence specificity control in the experiments we describe herein.",

            "text": "The first attempted use of a synthetic molecule to alter HIV-1 frameshifting and thereby influence viral replication was reported by Green and co-workers in 1998. 27 The authors showed that 1,4-bis[N-(3-N,N-dimethylpropyl)amidino]benzene tetrahydrochloride, a bis guanidinium-containing compound termed \"RG501\", was able to stimulate \u22121 frameshifting, alter the Gag-Pol:Gag ratio, inhibit HIV-1 replication in CEM cells (a lymphocytic cell line), and interfere with the formation of viral particles in chronically infected CH-1 cells (a COS cell line stably transfected with HIV-gpt, an HIV derivative in which the E. coli gpt gene replaces HIV env 28 ). Increases in reverse transcriptase (RT) following treatment with 1.5 mM RG501 were also observed, as would be expected for an increase in Gag-Pol production. Recently, the Butcher group confirmed that this compound indeed binds the HIV-1 FSS RNA with weak affinity (K D \u223c 360 \u03bcM), and they carried out NMR structure analysis, indicating that RG501 binds in the major groove of the upper stem-loop. 29 Unfortunately, as noted by the authors, RG501 is a relatively nonselective binder and interacts with other RNAs. It stimulates frameshifting in viruses with different FSS, 29 and likely that also interacts with the ribosome. 6 RG501 is also toxic, 27 a likely result of its lack of selectivity. Moreover, its interference with HIV replication begins at concentrations below those observed to affect frameshifting. 27, 24 Other compounds such as guanidinoneomycin, 30 idarubicin, and doxorubicin 31 have been shown to bind the HIV-1 FSS. Doxorubicin was found to bind with a K D of 2.8 \u03bcM, decreased frameshifting in a rabbit reticulocyte assay, and also significantly reduced overall translation. A screen of an Arg-rich peptide library revealed a sequence able to significantly reduce frameshifting, but this displayed no selectivity for the HIV-1 FSS relative to other frameshift-stimulating constructs and likely also interacts with the ribosome. 32 Thus, as far as we are aware, there are no reported examples of synthetic molecules able to alter HIV-1 frameshifting and interfere with viral infectivity via selective, high-affinity binding to the FSS RNA.",

These studies also indicated that affinity was essentially abolished if the \u03c0-surface area of the molecule was reduced, while the peptidic portion of 1 was required for sequence-selective binding. 35 (Right) HTLV-2 FSS stem-loop sequence used as a specificity control in this work. Note that when the slippery sequence occupies the decoding site of the ribosome, the lower stem is unwound and it is the upper stem-loop that acts as the effective frameshift stimulatory signal. While the binding ability of 2 and 3 was intriguing, subsequent preliminary experiments indicated the compounds were unable to inhibit virus in a pseudotyped HIV-1 assay (data not shown). Given these results, we hypothesized that further increases in affinity were essential. We anticipated that increasing the \u03c0 surface area of 1 could represent a viable strategy for enhancing the affinity for the HIV-1 FSS without significant reductions in selectivity. In particular, incorporation of a benzo[g]quinoline moiety to produce 4 and 5 was viewed as attractive. This hypothesis was supported in part by parallel efforts in our laboratory on the design and synthesis of compounds targeting CUG repeat RNA in which incorporation of a benzo[g]quinoline was found to enhance affinity and to provide compounds with activity in vivo in a mouse model of Type 1 Myotonic Dystrophy. 37 Synthesis of 4 and 5 proceeded via cross-metathesis of half-structure 6, by analogy to our previous work. We also synthesized 7 and 8 (\"one-armed\" benzo[g]quinoline-bearing structures), as well as compounds 9 and 10, to test the effect of sequential removal of the putative intercalators. Compound 11 was synthesized in order to ascertain the effectiveness of the olefin bioisostere in improving cellular availability and bioactivity relative to an easily reduced disulfide.",

This technique allows the equilibrium constant (K D ) and kinetic rate constants (k on , k off ) to be determined in a label-free format. 38 A 5\u2032-biotin labeled HIV-1 FSS RNA upper stem-loop (sequence as in Figure 1 ) was immobilized on a streptavidinfunctionalized sensor chip. Compound solutions in HBS buffer (0.01 M HEPES, 0.150 M NaCl, pH = 7.4) were flowed over the RNA, and the reference-subtracted sensorgrams were recorded. The associative and dissociative phases of the experimental sensorgrams for at least five different concentrations were globally fit to a 1:1 Langmuir equation to obtain the binding constants. 39 Under these conditions, benzo[g]quinoline-containing compounds 4 and 5 bound the HIV-1 FSS with affinities (K D ) of 89 nM and 102 nM, respectively, in each case representing an approximately 50-fold increased affinity over 2 and 3 (Table 1) . Binding by benzo[g]quinoline containing monomer 6 was 200fold weaker relative to that of the dimers 4 and 5. Removal of one heterocycle \"arm\" also resulted in an approximately 200fold decrease in affinity for 7 and a 30-fold decrease for 8, while removal of both benzo[g]quinoline groups completely abrogated binding between 10 and the HIV-1 FSS RNA, consistent with our prior results, indicating the importance of the heterocyclic group for affinity. Disulfide linked compound 11 bound the target RNA with a K D of 0.741 \u03bcM, which is \u223c7fold weaker relative to the olefin analogs 4 and 5. No binding was observed between the 2-ethyl benzo[g]quinoline carboxylic acid and the HIV-1FSS by SPR.

In these experiments, saturable quenching of benzo[g]quinoline fluorescence was observed as a function of added unlabeled RNA. Dissociation constants obtained in this manner ( Table 2 ) for 4 and 5 binding the HIV-1 FSS RNA are in general agreement with those obtained via SPR. By fluorescence we observe a 5-fold selectivity for 4 binding the FSS RNA vs total yeast tRNA, while selectivity for FSS RNA vs FSS DNA was 4-fold. The selectivity of 5 for FSS RNA vs tRNA was somewhat lower (2.14-fold). Curiously, unlike 4, 5 had no selectivity for FSS RNA vs FSS DNA. Thus, as 2 and 3 were previously found to have no measurable affinity for tRNA, we conclude that the increase in affinity obtained on replacement of the quinoline moieties of 2 and 3 with benzo[g]quinoline does come with a cost of some decrease in selectivity. This result is in contrast to what was observed in a related series of compounds optimized for binding triplet repeat RNA sequences relevant to type 1 myotonic dystrophy. 37 It is likely that these differences have a structural foundation, and further experiments will be needed to explore this hypothesis.",

Several constructs were employed. In the pDualHIV(\u22121) construct, Fluc is in the \u22121 reading frame relative to Rluc, while, in the pDualHIV(0) construct, Fluc is in the 0 reading frame relative to Rluc. In both cases, Fluc is expressed only as a fused Rluc-Fluc protein, but in the case of pDualHIV(\u22121), a \u22121 frameshift is required. To ascertain if compound-dependent effects on frameshifting are specific to HIV-1, we also carried out an analogous \u22121 PRF assay using constructs in which the HTLV-2 frameshift site 44 was inserted between Rluc and Fluc genes, such that Fluc is only synthesized by a \u22121PRF event [pDualHTLV-2 (\u22121)]. 45 HEK 293FT cells were transiently transfected separately with pDualHIV(\u22121) and pDualHIV(0) plasmids. The frameshift efficiency (defined as the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase activities) in the pDualHIV(\u22121) transfected cells was measured in the presence of varying concentrations of compounds (0\u221250 \u03bcM). A statistically significant (p < 0.005) dose-dependent increase in Fluc to Rluc ratios, >50% at 50 \u03bcM, was observed following treatment with 4 or 5 ( Figure 4 ). Control compound 10, which showed no measurable binding to the HIV-1 FSS by SPR, had no significant effect on \u22121 PRF in pDualHIV(\u22121) transfected cells under similar conditions. In HEK 293FT cells transfected with the pDualHIV(0) plasmids, the fused Renillafirefly luciferase protein is synthesized by conventional translation rules, i.e. without ribosomal frameshifting. Therefore, to confirm that the observed effect in pDualHIV(\u22121) cells is a direct effect of compound on frameshift-dependent translation, pDualHIV(0) transfected cells were treated analogously with compounds 4 and 5. No change in Fluc to Rluc ratio relative to untreated pDualHIV(0) transfected HEK 293FT cells was observed, suggesting that 4 and 5 specifically stimulate \u22121 frameshift translation in cells. Disulfide linked 11 stimulated HIV-1 frameshifting by approximately 25% (Supporting Information); this lower effect compared to the cases of 4 and 5 is consistent with its lower affinity to the HIV-1 FSS and likely lability in the cell. Treatment of HEK 293FT transfected with the pDualHTLV-2 (\u22121) construct with compounds 4, 5, or 11 resulted in no change in Fluc/Rluc ratio compared to the case of untreated cells. This is consistent with in vitro SPR results in which no binding was observed between these compounds and the HTLV-2 FSS RNA.",

In order for the observed \u22121 frameshift effect of compounds to be significant, it was important that it correlate to an equivalent reduction in viral replication. To assess this, we analyzed the effect of compounds in a single-round infection with pseudotyped HIV in HEK 293T producer cells and TZM-bl target cells (a HeLa cell line). 46 The wild type HIV proviral vector (pDHIV3-GFP) codes for all HIV-1 NL4\u22123 genes except nef (which is replaced with GFP) and env, thus preserving gag and pol, and the frameshift required for production of the Gag-Pol polyprotein. Preliminary experiments with 2 and 3 showed no activity in this assay. However, we observed a statistically significant (p < 0.001) and concentration-dependent decrease in infectivity of the pseudotyped HIV-1 virions when producer cells were treated with 4 and 5 ( Figure 5 ). The decrease in infectivity was >90% at a concentration of 20 \u03bcM 4, and >90% at a concentration of 40 \u03bcM for 5. The core peptide alone (10) showed a modest decrease in infectivity at a concentration of 40 . Compounds 4 and 5 increase frameshifting (>50%) in a dual-luciferase assay incorporating the HIV-1 FSS but have no effect on frameshifting in analogous assay incorporating the HTLV-2 FSS. Relative frameshift efficiency in HEK 293FT cells treated with 4, 5 or control peptide 10 after transfection with pDualHIV (\u22121) or pDualHTLV-2 (\u22121). The frameshift efficiency was calculated as the ratio of Fluc to Rluc in pDualHIV(\u22121) or pDualHTLV-2 (\u22121) transiently transfected cells. This ratio was arbitrarily set to 100% for plasmid-transfected cells, but not exposed to compounds. Error is SEM on three replicates for each concentration. \u03bcM, likely via nonspecific effects, given its lack of affinity for the FSS. EC 50 values for 4 and 5 were 3.9 and 25.6 \u03bcM, respectively. The protease inhibitor Indinavir was tested in parallel to calibrate the assay; its EC 50 was found to be 14.8 nM, in line with previously reported values. 47 While virus titer was determined in these experiments using an ELISA assay to normalize viral load into target cells, a compound-dependent decrease in viral production was also readily observable via fluorescence microscopy, as the pseudotyped HIV carries GFP as a marker ( Figure 6 ). Phasecontrast images of these cells showed no morphological changes, consistent with WST-1 results (Supporting Information). The concentration range required for a decrease in viral infectivity by 4 and 5 was similar to the range at which a significant increase in \u22121 frameshift was observed in HEK 293 FT cells, supporting the hypothesis that these compounds exert their antiviral activity primarily by altering \u22121 PRF. In order to provide further support for this hypothesis, viral particles were isolated from supernatants from these experiments by spinning through a 20% sucrose cushion, and probed via Western blot for the presence of reverse transcriptase (RT). As RT is produced only as part of the Gag-Pol fusion, increasing amounts of RT relative to capsid protein p24 (a structural protein produced as part of Gag) would be required given an increase in frameshifting. Indeed, that is what is observed as a function of added 4 or 5 (Figure 7) . The amount of RT in unprocessed Gag-Pol (p160) relative to mature RT (p66 + p51) also increased significantly; this may indicate that treatment with compounds 4 and 5 also inhibits Pol processing. However, the pattern of p160 cleavage intermediates observed ",

An intriguing observation from our initial screen 36 was the finding that a symmetrical compound was selected, despite the target RNA being nonsymmetrical. This work confirms that both putative intercalators are required for high-affinity binding, as compounds 7 and 8 had only weak affinity for the FSS. Structural analysis will be essential to fully understand the binding mode of 4 and 5, but the recognition of a nonsymmetrical RNA binding site by a symmetrical, dimeric molecule is not unprecedented; for example, Arya and colleagues have described the use of neomycin dimers for recognition of HIV TAR RNA, 50 and the Hergenrother group designed deoxystreptamine dimers that bound nonsymmetrical RNA loops. 51 Likewise, structural information should prove useful for understanding the significantly higher selectivity of 4 for FSS RNA over FSS DNA and tRNA relative to 5.",

            "text": "These enhanced compounds are able to alter frameshifting in a dual luciferase assay in HEK 293FT cells and strongly inhibit viral infectivity in a pseudotyped HIV assay. Relative to previously studied compounds targeting frameshifting in HIV, compounds 4 and 5 produce a roughly equivalent increase in RT at a 37.5-fold lower concentration than RG501. As such, compounds 4 and 5 represent promising leads for further study, as well as interesting tools to further investigate the mechanism of \u22121 PRF. Since the pseudotyped HIV used in this assay is only capable of one round of replication, we anticipate that stronger effects will be observed with wild-type HIV in a spreading infection assay. Of course, further enhancements in affinity and selectivity would likely improve activity as well. As discussed above, previous high-throughput screening efforts targeting frameshift-modulating compounds in which bicistronic reporters provided the assay readout largely yielded compounds acting on the ribosome. Given this observation, it has been suggested by others that assays focused on direct binding to the FSS RNA could be advantageous, as such compounds could potentially increase frameshifting by inhibiting unwinding of the upper stem-loop. 6 The results presented herein support this hypothesis. In the context of HIV biology, our results with compounds 4 and 5 indicate that an increase in frameshifting and a concomitant increase in the Gag-Pol/Gag ratio decreases viral fitness. This is consistent with the work of Mak and colleagues, who increased the Gag-Pol/Gag ratio via cotransfection. 52 \u25a0 EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Reagents. Commercially available reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO), TCI America (Portland, OR), Fisher Scientific, EMD Chemicals (Gibbstown, NJ), Advanced ChemTech (Louisville, KY), and Alfa Aesar, and were used without further purification unless otherwise noted. Water used for reactions and aqueous workup was glass-distilled from a deionized water feed. Reagent grade solvents were used for all nonaqueous extractions. Reaction progress was monitored by analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using EM silica gel 60 F-254 precoated glass plates (0.25 mm). Compounds were visualized on the TLC plates with a UV lamp (dual wavelength; \u03bb = 254 nm, \u03bb =360 nm). Synthesized compounds were purified using flash column chromatography on EM silica gel 60 (230\u2212400) mesh or alternatively via preparative reversed phase HPLC. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin\u22121% streptomycin. Premixed WST-1 cell proliferation reagent was purchased from Clontech, and luminescence assays were carried out using a Promega dual-luciferase assay kit following manufacture's instructions.",

Compounds were synthesized following procedures analogous to those previously reported. 35, 37 All compounds were produced in >95% purity, as determined by analytical HPLC. Briefly, 4 and 5 were synthesized from olefin precursor monomer 6, which was assembled on Wang resin by standard Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) methods. One half of the resin-bound monomer was cleaved using 50% TFA in DCM with 1% TES, and was used as solution phase partner in an olefin metathesis reaction employing Grubbs' second generation catalyst. The olefin products (isomer ratio of Z/E = 2:3) were isolated using reverse phase HPLC on a C18 column (Waters, XBridge Prep C18 5 \u03bcm OBD, 19 mm \u00d7 250 mm) using gradient elution from 5 to 100% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA in water/0.1% TFA. Olefin geometries were assigned by comparing the olefin proton chemical shifts of the E-olefin downfield to the Z-isomer and also by the infrared spectra of the compounds as described previously. 37 Figure 7 . Compounds affect Gag:Gag-Pol ratio in pseudotyped virions. Equal loads of viral particles (measured by p24 ELISA) were isolated from media of viral producer cells by spinning through a 20% sucrose cushion at 100,000g. The viral particles were Western blotted for RT (Abcam) and p24 (NIH AIDS Reagent Program, cat #3537). Densitometry of nonsaturated bands was used to calculate ratios for p160/(p66+p51) (listed below the RT blot) and the ratio of total (all bands) RT/p24 are (listed below the p24 blot). Compounds 7 and 8 were synthesized by a slight modification to the procedures described above. The tripeptide (Phe-Pro-AllylGly) was first assembled using Fmoc peptide coupling chemistry on Wang resin. The resin-bound tripeptide was then separated into two equal parts. 2-Ethyl benzo[g]quinoline carboxylic acid was coupled to half the material and cleaved with TFA. This was then employed as the solution phase component in olefin cross-metathesis with the remaining bead-bound portion of Fmoc-protected tripeptide.",
