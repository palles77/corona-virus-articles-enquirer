Although PCR technology provides a much more sensitive and specific method for detecting viral nucleic acids, its role in diagnosing active viral infection has been only partially explored (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . The purpose of this chapter is to present our preliminary findings using a PCR screening procedure for common respiratory viruses and review our data concerning the possible role of latent infection with the adenovirus and persistent viral infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in the pathogenesis of chronic lung inflammation.",

The lung histology and immunohistochemistry of the inflammatory reaction in these cases was the subject of a recent report (9) . Six additional cases (four lifetime non-smokers and two with remote minimal smoking histories) were added to control for the fact that both the asthmatics and non-asthmatics smoked heavily. We then used data from two viruses (the adenovirus and RSV) to discuss the possible role of latent and persistent viral infection in the pathogenesis of chronic lung inflammation.",

Briefly, the resected specimens were allowed to collapse and the tumour was palpated through the pleural surface, bisected and sampled for histology. The regional lymph nodes were then dissected and the bronchial resection margins sampled to obtain the material needed to complete a standard surgical pathology report. The incision made in the pleural surface was then sutured closed, and the lung filled with a cryoprotective agent and suspended over liquid nitrogen on aluminium foil in a closed styrofoam container until it was frozen solid. The frozen lung was then cut into 1.5 cm thick slices on a band saw in the transverse plane and these slices were kept frozen on dry ice while they were sampled with a power-driven hole saw. The cores of tissue obtained by this procedure were stored at -70~ until used. The lung specimens obtained at autopsy were processed in a similar manner without the necessity of cutting the pleural surface.",

Table I shows the age, sex distribution, smoking history and history of recent infection for the minimal smokers (MS) (n = 6), asthmatic (n = 5) and non-asthmatic (n = 7) groups. The asthmatics were all moderate smokers with an average history of 562 _+ 148 cigarette years (approximately 28 pack years) of consumption. The smoking group without asthma tended to have a higher exposure, 1089 _+ 680 cigarette years (approximately 54 pack years) of exposure, but this did not reach statistical significance because of the wide variance between subjects. The group with the lowest cigarette exposure contained four lifetime non-smokers and two cases (1, 16) with minimal remote smoking histories. The available lung function in the group with little smoking history was within normal limits and there was no statistically significant difference in lung function between the patients who were smokers and either did or did not have asthma. Figure 1 shows representative autoradiographs of an agarose gel containing the results of the PCR analysis from 10 samples, plus the positive and negative control for each virus tested. These data show that RSV, influenza A, influenza C and adenovirus were the most prevalent viruses in these 10 cases.

The tests required to establish that each of these steps has occurred include culture to document viral replication, in situ hybridization or PCR to detect viral nucleic acids, immunocytochemistry or immunohistochemistry to demonstrate viral proteins, and electron microscopy to establish that a complete virus has been assembled. These changes are usually associated with seroconversion in the host indicating that there has been an immune response to the virus.

The results reported in Fig. 1 and Table IV establish that the nucleic acid from several respiratory viruses was present in the lower respiratory tract of these subjects. Six of the 15 patients undergoing lung resection gave a history of a flu-like illness or upper respiratory infection in the 3-8 weeks prior to surgery. Others may have had asymptomatic infections but there was no difference in either the number or type of virus detected between the groups with and without symptomatic illness. Replicating virus is shed from the upper airways for only 5-7 days following acute infections (13) but viral nucleic acid may remain long after the virus ceases to replicate. Recent animal studies reported from our laboratory have shown that RSV can be demonstrated by culture two months after infection and by RT-PCR four months after an acute infection (14) , and PCR has shown similar results in guinea pig adenoviral bronchiolitis (15) . It is much more difficult to establish viral persistence in humans because many respiratory viruses have several serotypes and infection by a different serotype could easily be mistaken for persistence. For example, the screen used for adenovirus in the study is based on a sequence for a hexon protein that is common to all adenoviral serotypes. This makes it a sensitive test for the presence of adenovirus but it is not a useful test for persistent adenoviral infection because it cannot differentiate between serotypes.",

This might result from previous sensitization of the host to viral proteins during a lytic infection, with reinforcement of the sensitization by protein produced either by persistent low level replication of the virus or by the expression of latent viral genes remaining after replication has ceased. The importance of the host response was illustrated by the early attempts to develop RSV vaccines where fatal bronchiolitis sometimes occurred when the vaccinated children were next exposed to a wild type virus (17) . More recent studies of healthy individuals infected with rhinovirus showed that the severity of the upper respiratory infection could be diminished by administration of neutralizing antibodies to non-atopic subjects but was without effect in atopic subjects. A report of suppression of virally induced asthmatic attacks with prolongation of viral shedding in animals with parainfluenza virus infection receiving corticosteroid therapy (19) is consistent with symptoms being caused by the response to the virus rather than to direct tissue damage caused by the virus. This concept was further supported by a recent report showing that the airways of patients who die from asthma are infiltrated with CD8 + T lymphocytes, suggesting that the cellular immune response of the host contributes to fatal asthma attacks (20) . All of these studies suggest that the host immune response to the virus is important in inducing and/ or amplifying the airway inflammatory process responsible for asthma. Therefore, although the relevance of the viral nucleic acid demonstrated in the present study is unclear, we believe that the mechanisms whereby persistent or latent viral infection might contribute to chronic airway inflammation deserves to be investigated.",

            "text": "Recent studies of adenoviral infection indicate that latent adenoviral DNA expresses a protein capable of amplifying an asymptomatic inflammatory response into one capable of causing chronic airways obstruction (21) . Several laboratories have shown that the protein coded by an early adenoviral gene (E1A) dysregulates gene expression by interacting with the DNA-binding sites of transcription factors (22) . This same protein can also interfere with the function of suppressor genes such as the retinoblastoma gene product (23) and interfere with gene expression by binding to the CREB-binding protein (CBP) (24) . Our studies have established that excessive amounts of adenovirus E1A DNA are present in lungs from patients with obstructive lung disease (25) and that E1A protein can be demonstrated in human lungs (26) . Very recent studies of transfected A549 cells have shown that E1A is capable ofupregulating IL-8 and ICAM-1 when these cells are challenged (27) . Our working hypothesis is that latent adenoviral infection is capable of amplifying the cigarette smoke-induced airway inflammation present in all smokers, to produce airway obstruction in the minority of patients who develop this complication. The relevance of this hypothesis to asthma remains to be determined but Macek et al. (28) have provided an interesting lead by showing that children with bronchiolitis who subsequently develop steroid-resistant asthma frequently show evidence of the adenoviral hexon protein in their BAL fluid. RSV, parainfluenza virus (PIV) and mumps virus are paramyxoviruses that are characterized by a single-stranded, negative polarity RNA genome with a heavily glycosylated envelope. In children, RSV and PIV are, respectively, the most common causes of acute bronchiolitis and croup. In addition to these serious acute lower respiratory tract infections, epidemiological studies have clearly established that many children develop sequelae of recurrent wheezing and asthma, typically in the context of allergy (29) (30) (31) . Animal studies have reported that experimental RSV and PIV lower respiratory tract infections can produce increases in airway responsiveness that persist for weeks to months after acute infection (32, 33) . Histological examination of the lungs of RSV-infected guinea pigs after resolution of acute bronchiolitis reveals evidence of chronic inflammation and the presence of viral proteins in the airways (12, 33) . Chronic airway inflammation, mast cell hyperplasia of the airway wall and increased expression of cytokines such as TGF-fl have also been reported as sequelae of PIV infection in rats that have persistent airway hyper-responsiveness (34). These observations suggest that persistent viral lung infections may cause structural changes to the airways, which could result in airway hyper-responsiveness, a hallmark of asthma.",

Several lines of evidence have implicated viral infections in triggering initial sensitization to environmental allergens in susceptible children (31) and experimental animals (35). The development of RSV-specific IgE antibodies in children with postbronchiolitis wheezing is consistent with RSV being a 'marker' of an allergic diathesis. Our laboratorty has recently reported that airway hyper-responsiveness produced in ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pigs is exaggerated by acute RSV infection, in part mediated by virus-induced increases in airway epithelial necrosis (36). These observations are consistent with the paradigm that allergic individuals are not more susceptible to viral respiratory tract infections but do develop more severe symptoms of infection than non-allergic subjects (1) . A better understanding of the relative importance of direct viral damage to the airways and indirect viral damage via allergic mechanisms could lead to valuable new strategies for treatment and prevention of viral respiratory infections and their sequelae.",

Dr. Hayashi in our group is trying to test the hypothesis that it may be integrated into host DNA. She has begun with the Graham 293 cell because these cells are permanently transfected with adenoviral E1A. By choosing primers in E1A DNA that allow the inverse PCR technique to be applied, she has amplified the unknown DNA adjacent to the E1A. She has preliminary results including sequence data extending across the junction of adenoviral and human DNA. The next step is to attempt to determine whether there is integration in the human lung, but this will be a greater challenge because the E1A is much more widely dispersed.",

            "text": "Hogg: I would like to stress that we looked at the nucleic acid. The only protein we've looked at so far is the E1A protein; you can't assume just because the nucleic acid is there that anything else happens. I think you have to show that it really happens.Schwartz: The airway epithelium is the primary target in the initial infection and then you just get nonreplicative viral nucleic acid retained. Then you'd expect that the asthmatic airway with its increased turnover of epithelium discards the infected epithelial cells more rapidly over time and shows less. Is this correct?Hogg: That's correct, unless the viral DNA gets integrated into the host cell DNA. At present, we don't know if the virus first entered the lungs in the remote past or in the week before the sample was obtained. When we compared cases that gave us a history of recent infection to cases that did not have this history, there was no difference in the number of viruses found.Grant: There is a group of patients that I see every winter that I've always been very curious about. These are people that seem to develop some respiratory virus infection and then cough for about six months. We've always assumed it would be impossible for a viral infection to continue. I don't believe there has ever been an adequate explanation for this problem. Some are smokers, some are not, some have asthma, some don't, some have rhinitis and some don't. So, I think in the clinic there is some evidence of some persistence of a phenomenon, and perhaps you have some explanation for it.Hogg: The NIH Lung Health Study has shown that many of the people who develop chronic obstructive lung disease do so without any cough, sputum production or any other symptoms. If the adenovirus were to produce an infection and remain in the lung for a long period of time, it is reasonable to think that the residual adenoviral E1A protein expressed in the latent period when there is no viral replication might amplify the initial inflammatory response to the infection. But that's very speculative. In our model of latent adenoviral infection in the guinea pig, the animals with latent infection show persistent airways inflammation and an enhanced inflammatory response to a single dose of cigarette smoke in the latent period.Gleich: You showed an epithelial cell and the presence of adenovirus. Do you have any sense as to the differential localization of adenovirus amongst cells in the lung?Hogg: I contacted colleagues from around the world who'd autopsied cases of children who died from adenovirus infection. These cases were all proven to be due to adenoviral infections using viral culture to prove replication and electron microscopy to show complete viral assembly. We studied those with in situ hybridization and the cells with high copy numbers of the virus were mostly airway epithelial cells. Because the majority of these cells were epithelial type 2 cells, which serve as the repair cell for the alveolar surface, we believe the virus may readily infect cells that are dividing. This strongly suggests that the epithelial cells are the primary target but other cells such as peripheral blood lymphocytes and tonsils have been shown to carry latent infection by other investigators.Gleich: Have you tried to do these studies on induced sputum? Hogg: No, we have not.",
