However, regulatory gaps in safety review oversight are effectively being managed by including many of these professionals on IBCs and in \"scope creep\" of IBCs. Scope creep is having a profound impact on the types of research these committees review, the way IBCs operate and the time it takes these committees and their dedicated appointees to perform their jobs related to review.

Biosecurity is achieved through an aggregate of practices including the education and training of laboratory personnel, security risk assessments, Biological Select Agent and Toxin (BSAT) access controls, physical security (facility) safeguards and the regulated transport of BSAT. Achieving effective biosecurity for BSAT is a shared responsibility between the Federal Government and facilities/ individuals that possess, use or transfer BSAT.\" \"Complementary to, but distinct from biosecurity is biosafety based on principles of containment and risk assessment in the laboratory.\" Containment includes: \"the microbiological practices, safety equipment, and facility safeguards that protect laboratory workers, the environment and the public from exposure to infectious micro organisms that are handled in the laboratory,\" whereas risk assessment is \"the process that enables the appropriate selection of microbiological practices, safety equipment, and facility safeguards that can prevent laboratory-associated infections.\" In short, biosecurity refers to the tools to manage threats, whereas biosafety procedures mitigate risks.",

So, how can academic EHS staff piggyback on the Guidelines to provide practical project review? What gaps exist in current government-mandated safety reviews? And how do EHS programs support risk assessment and hazard review in a timely manner so as to manage the risks of working with biological systems and agents? A brief brainstorming session among EHS staff may identify many programs with biological systems and agents and toxins requiring review, including but not limited to the following: The reality is that many organizations are using the expertise and organizational structure of their respective IBCs to support safety and health reviews of items like those listed above which are not defined within the scope of the NIH Guidelines. Because IBCs by nature are interdisciplinary teams, they are uniquely positioned to support safety and health reviews and serve as a safety gatekeeper for many kinds of research protocols. This can be both a blessing and a curse because the committees provide a framework and structure for conducting safety reviews recognizing that the time commitment may be onerous and academic departments may not reward participation on safety and health committees. In the long term though, the benefit of using an IBC to conduct health and safety reviews is a worthy initiative and serves to protect the institution, its employees, and students by managing risk. The physical damage to life and limb, inadvertent exposure to biological agents or toxins to persons or the environment and potential damage to reputation caused by laboratory and research program accidents should convince anyone who questions this expansion of IBC duties to pause and see the logic of supporting IBC safety reviews outside the boundaries of their traditional role.",

            "text": "The NIH Guidelines apply to all researchers at an institution if anyone at that institution accepts NIH funding for recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid research. This often means that even researchers who accept no NIH money must adhere to the NIH Guidelines. The NIH Guidelines do not apply to institutions in the United States that receive no NIH funding, however, including pharmaceutical companies, other private companies performing research with recombinant or potentially infectious materials, or private individuals. This regulatory gap allows for the possibility of risky work with recombinant DNA proceeding without any oversight. Pharmaceutical companies, by nature, are investigating agents that will be used as therapeutics and are designed to have a favorable risk-benefit ratio. This may lead people working with these agents to believe that the agents have no hazards associated with them. However, many genetically modified study drugs are targeted against conditions with poor prognoses, so these potential therapeutics can have significant adverse side effects and still have a favorable risk-benefit ratio for the trial participant. If the clinical trial is supported solely by private funding and is performed only at clinical care centers that receive no NIH funding (e.g., private cancer centers) then the clinical trial does not fall under the NIH Guidelines. This means that the trial does not need to undergo public discussion through submission to NIH's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) or have local review by an IBC [8] . These trials would still be required to undergo Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review and local IRB review, but those bodies review different aspects than the RAC and IBC do. For example, the FDA and local IRB focus primarily on the safety of the recipients by ensuring the ethical conduct of the trial [9] . While the RAC and IBC also consider participant safety, they bring specific technical expertise needed for the assessment of the risks to close contacts of the recipient as well as the healthcare professionals preparing and administering the agent. Genetically modified viruses or other gene therapy agents may have the potential to modify the genetic code of the recipient's reproductive cells, making effective barrier contraception critical. Unlike traditional drugs which are metabolized and eventually broken down in the recipient's body, investigational agents created from microbes or modified human cells may be capable of replicating and expanding. This increases the opportunity for contamination of hospital rooms, personal bathrooms, or shared items such as eating utensils. Live agents, genetically modified or not, can pose risk of serious harm to individuals with immune deficiencies caused by organ transplant, infectious disease, pregnancy, or other conditions. Recipients of these agents must be instructed on how, and for how long, to minimize their contact with these high-risk individuals and how to properly clean and disinfect their homes to minimize the risk of transmission of potentially infectious study drug through bodily fluids. IBCs are responsible for reviewing the informed consent documents to verify that these instructions are adequately explained.",

At the volumes and concentrations used in manufacturing, however, these viruses may overcome their normal route of infection and present an aerosol infection risk. In addition to the direct effects of the gene therapy product or virus itself, an accident that results in exposure to manufacturing-scale quantities may induce a strong enough immune response or allergic reaction to lead to serious illness or death.

Others may be unaware that such safety resources are available to them or may actively avoid professional advice in pursuit of the \"DIY Ethic.\" Sale of most equipment used in recombinant DNA research is not regulated or controlled and it is relatively simple to acquire the necessary supplies to create a modest but fully functional laboratory. Online auction sites have thousands of listings for PCR machines, electrophoresis equipment, pipettes, and other basic equipment and supplies. Instructions for genetically modifying Escherichia coli and other bacteria are readily discoverable through Internet search engines and various online communities exist to bring together \"biohackers\" to discuss projects and techniques. At least one company was recently founded to provide a way for research universities to sell their surplus reagents to other universities and community members. Unlike model rockets or soccerplaying robots, modified pathogens generated by DIY biologists may be capable of replicating and spreading to others who are not actively participating in the hobby.

Among these are purchase and transfer of transgenic animals, use of non-viral plasmids in cell culture lines, and expression of recombinant proteins in standard laboratory strains of bacteria and yeast. Some IBCs continue to review these experiments to confirm the investigator's assessment that the work is exempt and to provide institutional assurances that all recombinant DNA work is being performed responsibly. It may also be administratively easier to train investigators to submit all of their work to the IBC rather than ask them to be familiar enough with the NIH Guidelines to distinguish between exempt experiments and experiments that require review and approval prior to initiation.",

Before work with any of the more than 60 agents begins, the institution must write detailed safety and security plans and be inspected by the Division of Select Agents and Toxins (DSAT) to verify that the proposed safety and security practices are sufficient to contain the agent from theft, loss, or accidental release to the environment. The Select Agent Regulations have several exemptions or exclusions, however. Select agent toxins are only regulated when a single individual possesses more than a threshold amount (0.5-100 mg, depending on the toxin). Institutions may have more than the threshold amount of toxin on their premises but remain exempt from the Select Agent Regulations because no one individual has more than the threshold quantity of toxin in their possession.",

Determining whether or not the hybrid virus is regulated as a select agent can be difficult and is the responsibility of the institution performing the work (after consulting the select agent and toxin list as updated by the responsible regulatory agencies, USDA and HHS). Consequently, different institutions may come to different conclusions about what is, or isn't, regulated, and work with potentially dangerous hybrid viruses may be carried out in standard laboratory settings rather than in laboratories with the enhanced security features required by the Select Agent Regulations. Because of their expertise in recombinant DNA risk assessment, IBCs are often tasked with helping the institution's Responsible Official determine whether these chimeric viruses should be treated as regulated select agents or not. At institutions where no IBC is present, no oversight body would be available to educate investigators on the possible safety and regulatory implications of mixing genes from select agent viruses with non-regulated viruses and potentially dangerous chimeric viruses may be inadvertently created. If investigators do not realize that these chimeric viruses are more pathogenic than the parent strain then they may not use the proper safety precautions or laboratory facilities. This, in turn, could lead to occupational exposures or environmental releases that could place the surrounding community at risk.",

            "text": "In September 2014, the Policy for Institutional Oversight of Life Sciences Dual Use Research of Concern was released [13] . This policy describes the requirements for local review, approval, and oversight of dual use research of concern (DURC). DURC is described in detail elsewhere in this book but, in short, DURC refers to research that produces valuable scientific information but may also be used in warfare or terror attacks. This federal policy requires that each institution designate an Institutional Review Entity (IRE) to review DURC projects and assist in creation of risk mitigation plans for these projects. The companion guide [14] that accompanies the federal policy suggests that IBCs are the most logical choice for the IRE since similar expertise is needed to assess the risks associated with recombinant DNA research and modifications of pathogens that may increase their transmissibility or pathogenicity. IBCs may not have the security expertise needed for these reviews, however, and consultants or ad hoc members may need to be added to fulfill the responsibilities assigned to the IRE. The DURC policy only applies to institutions that receive federal funding for life sciences research and is restricted to research involving 15 specific pathogens. Institutions or individuals that receive no federal funding are under no obligation to follow the DURC policy, nor are individuals who are working with pathogens other than the 15 specifically listed in the DURC policy. Many common human pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, E. coli, or influenza) are not on the list of pathogens covered by the DURC policy. Consequently, there is no regulatory reason why researchers cannot modify the pathogens to become more virulent. While this research would most likely be done to study the mechanisms that make pathogens more deadly and to better understand how to control natural infections with these pathogens, publication of this research may provide a roadmap for individuals who would use biological agents in terrorist attacks.",

While gain-of-function (GOF) is not specifically defined in the White House memo, the general consensus is that GOF refers to any experiments that increase the pathogenicity or mammalian transmissibility of these pathogens. The White House memo also does not describe how GOF research should be identified or reviewed at institutions performing infectious disease research. Because GOF is similar to DURC, it seems most likely that institutions will ask their IREs to review GOF research in addition to DURC. This will increase the workload for IBCs which will now be tasked to make decisions about GOF research in the absence of clear guidance or policy statements from the federal government regarding what is, or isn't, GOF research. This funding pause is not yet a formal policy and it currently only applies to individuals receiving federal funding for these three specific agents so the number of researchers impacted is expected to be low.",

The DURC policy and GOF funding pause provide more guidance on how and when IBCs need to formalize these types of reviews and recommendations.
