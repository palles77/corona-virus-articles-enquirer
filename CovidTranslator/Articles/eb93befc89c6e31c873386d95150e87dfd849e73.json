Binding to a 10mer polyA, a 10mer polyU and a 13mer RNA of mixed sequence (1) was tested by using 3'-Carboxyfluorescein ( KCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 ) for 60 min. FAM-labelled RNA was visualized using the ImaGo system (B&L systems) with maximal excitation at 302 nm. This is not the optimal excitation wavelength for the FAM-label; however, the FAM-label still absorbed sufficient light to give a stable emission signal that could be easily detected. Subsequently, proteins were stained with Coomassie Instant Blue \u00ae .",

All measurements were performed in titration buffer and traces were recorded in triplicates and averaged. To measure off-rates for mantdADP, chase experiments were performed in which an equilibrated solution of 0.5 \u00b5M mantdADP and 0.5 \u00b5M DDX1 was rapidly mixed with 250 or 500 \u00b5M of unlabeled ADP. These chase experiments were also performed in the presence of 40 \u00b5M 10mer polyA RNA. Moreover the same chase experiments were performed with the DDX1 R605A-R608A mutant. Traces were fitted to a single exponential function that gave the rate constant for mantdADP dissociation. To obtain data for the release of ADP from DDX1, different chase experiments were performed, in which an equilibrated solution of 0.5 \u00b5M ADP and 0.5 \u00b5M DDX1 was rapidly mixed with 5 or 10 \u00b5M of mantdADP. In contrast to the previous displacement experiments, we observed an increase in signal due to mantdADP binding that was fitted by single exponential function to obtain a rate constant for ADP dissociation.",

Purification of construct DDX1 by size exclusion chromatography. A construct of human DDX1 that was C-terminally truncated by only 12 residues could be expressed as a stable fragment in E. coli and purified to high homogeneity.

Three traces are shown, one in which the chase was performed in the presence of saturating amounts of 10mer polyA RNA (green), one in the absence of RNA (blue) and one in which the chase was performed with the DDX1 R605A-R608A mutant (purple).

Traces represent chase experiments with DDX1 in the presence (green) or absence (blue) of RNA and chase experiments with DDX1 R605A-R608A mutant (purple). Single exponential fits (black lines) gave similar off-rates for mantdADP dissociation (in grey). Offsets were set arbitrarily to 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 to be able to differentiate the curves.
