We will try to work with patient advocacy groups to ensure that plain language summaries of study findings are shared to both participating service users and wider patient groups. And through the communication of participants and researchers, the burden of the intervention will be assessed in a comprehensive and rational way. Trial participants will not be informed of the trial results directly. However, the final results will be published.

It is indicated in the Chou-ling-dan granules instructions that it can be used for children younger than 14. The Chou-ling-dan granules have been approved as OTC drugs for many years in the use of children under the guidance of doctors, and no serious adverse reactions were reported. And many of clinical trials of Chou-ling-dan on children and oseltamivir treatment for influenza in children had been reported1,2. 2. Besides, issue of patient compliance should be considered since the subjects of this study are outpatients. Their age should not be too young or too old, otherwise it would be hard to follow up and drop out easily. Moreover, children over the age of 14 are basically enrolled in secondary schools and can communicate well with doctors.",

Preparation of reference solution: Take the appropriate amount of artemitin reference substance, accurately weighed, add methanol to make a solution containing 20\u03bcg of artemitin per 1 ml. Preparation of test solution: To take one pack of Chou-ling-dan granules (content uniformity satisfy Pharmacopoeia requirements, about 3g), accurately weigh after mill, place in a conical flask, precision add 25ml of methanol, seal up, weighed, heated to reflux for 1 hour, let cool, weigh again, make up the lost weight with methanol, shake it, filter it, and take the subsequent filtrate.
