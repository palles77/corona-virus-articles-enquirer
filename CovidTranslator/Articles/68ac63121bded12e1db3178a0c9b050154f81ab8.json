Unfortunately, early investigations that used recycled ''pedigree\" virus strains seem to have led microbiologists to dismiss the common folk belief that vARIs often follow chilling. Today, incontrovertible evidence shows that ambient temperature dips and host chilling increase the incidence and severity of vARIs. This review considers four possible mechanisms, M1 -4, that can explain this link: (M1) increased crowding in winter may enhance viral transmission; (M2) lower temperatures may increase the stability of virions outside the body; (M3) chilling may increase host susceptibility; (M4) lower temperatures or host chilling may activate dormant virions. There is little evidence for M1 or M2, which are incompatible with tropical observations. Epidemiological anomalies such as the repeated simultaneous arrival of vARIs over wide geographical areas, the rapid cessation of influenza epidemics, and the low attack rate of influenza within families are compatible with M4, but not M3 (in its simple form). M4 seems to be the main driver of seasonality, but M3 may also play an important role.",

Other anomalous features of vARIs need to be explained too. For example, vARI epidemics often erupt very rapidly after ambient temperature drops. The increase may, however, be too rapid and too short-lived to be the result of increased transmission [5] , as discussed below. Surveys also show that epidemics often occur simultaneously throughout wide geographical areas [5] [6] [7] (see Figs. 1 and 2) . Moreover, influenza epidemics often cease very abruptly, even when many susceptible individuals remain in the population [7] .",

            "text": "The viruses that cause vARIs include many unrelated families such as double-stranded DNA viruses (e.g. adenovirus), positivesense single-stranded RNA viruses (e.g. coronavirus), negativesense single-stranded RNA viruses (e.g. respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, measles, mumps and parainfluenza virus), and positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses (e.g. hand foot and mouth virus, rhinovirus, rubella virus). They differ in their physical forms, with some having a lipid envelope (e.g. coronavirus, influenza, and parainfluenza viruses), which many others (e.g. adenovirus and rhinovirus) lack. Some are icosahedral (e.g. adenovirus. rhinovirus and Rubella virus) whereas many are spherical, filamentous or variable (e.g. RSV, influenza, and measles viruses). It is notable that the great majority of these diverse and often distantly-related strains share the same seasonality in temperate regions. For example, Hope-Simpson found in both 1954 and 1955 that the number of people suffering from ''colds\" in a sample of 380 volunteers was roughly 50 times greater in February than at the beginning of September [3] (Fig. 3) . The common cold is caused by over 200 serologically-distinct strains [8] . It is clear that the great majority of these strains share the same seasonality in temperate regions, since colds in general show such strong seasonality. However, variations in the precise timing of the various respiratory viruses within the cold season have been reported, and it has been suggested that these variations might reflect fundamental differences in the mechanisms of replication or transmission of the viruses involved [4, [9] [10] [11] . For example, rhinovirus is particularly prevalent in the autumn [12] , while RSV and influenza usually cause outbreaks around the turn of the year [12] . Several comments can be made here: (1) very few vARIs have been found that consistently show the opposite seasonality, with more outbreaks in summer than in winter. For example, a study at a children's hospital in Mainz, Germany, that used modern diagnostic tests found that 7 out of 10 vARIs displayed normal seasonality, since these 7 showed significant inverse correlations with ambient temperature (p-value < 0.001) [4] . The remaining 3 were weakly inversely correlated with temperature. (A counter-example was reported by Hope-Simpson [13] , although the tendency was weak: of the type 3 parainfluenza viruses isolated by him over 14 years, 66% were collected in the warm semester.) (2) Studies show that the reported variations in the timing of particular vARIs are in fact rather inconsistent. For example, RSV in children in Mainz peaked in spring in 2002 and 2006, but in the winters of the intervening years [4] . ( 3) It is possible that certain vARIs are more prevalent in, say, spring and autumn as a result of ''interference\" by other viral strains during winter. For example, the immune systems of hosts may frequently be activated by certain dominant viruses during the winter months, reducing the likelihood of subsequent infection by less active strains. The patterns of vARIs in the Mainz study suggest the existence of such interference (compare the relatively smooth curve of all respiratory illnesses in Fig. 1 in [4] with the irregular occurrences of the individual vARIs shown in Figs. 1 and 2 of that report).",

            "text": "Microbiologists have put forward many explanations of the seasonality of vARIs. Proposed explanations of influenza seasonality, for example, include factors that change host contact rates (school closures, ambient temperature and precipitation), factors that may influence virus survival outside the body (relative humidity, absolute humidity, solar radiation and temperature), and factors that may change the immunity of hosts (humidity, photoperiodicity, temperature, viral interference, as well as deficiency of selenium, vitamin C, vitamin D and vitamin E) [1] . (Factors that may change the behavior of viruses at the biochemical level are seldom considered.) The same or similar explanations have been put forward for other respiratory viruses [4, [9] [10] [11] [12] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . However, these wellknown explanations are very difficult to reconcile with a straightforward observation: the vARIs in question are present in many tropical regions at intermediate levels throughout the year -often at much higher levels than in the summer in temperate locations [1, 2] . Moreover, surveys show that the viral ''species\" that commonly cause vARIs in the tropics are similar to those in other climates. For example, the four most frequently identified viruses in two large hospitals in a tropical location (Singapore, 1990 (Singapore, -1994 were, in order of prevalence, RSV, parainfluenza, influenza A and adenovirus [10] . (Most samples came from hospitalized children.) Fig. 1 . Graph II from van Loghem's report [5] on the epidemiology of vARIs in the Netherlands in the winter of 1925/26, with ambient temperature superimposed. The graph shows the percentages of persons with colds in seven regions of the Netherlands for 37 weeks. The data was compiled from the reports of 6933 correspondents that were submitted by post each week. Amsterdam had the largest number of informants (1159) and Noord-Holland the fewest (581). I have added the daily minimum outdoor air temperature (also averaged over 7 days at weekly intervals) from five Dutch weather stations, with the temperature scale inverted (lowest temperatures at the top). Note that by far the highest rate of vARIs was at the beginning of the study (September 1925) , and that vARIs in different regions are closely correlated with each other and with inverted temperature. These correlations are strongest in the first half of the cold season. Correspondents reported coryza, angina, laryngitis, bronchitis and ''influenza\". It is likely that a variety of viral ''species\" were present. See the main text for discussion of the events occurring during the intervals labeled i1, i2 and i3. \u00d31928, 2015. This figure was originally published in the Journal of Hygiene, 28(01), 33-54. A similar study in an oceanic climate (Mainz, Germany, 1998 found that the four viruses that were most frequently identified among hospitalized children were, in order, rhinovirus, RSV, adenovirus and influenza A [4] . In Buenos Aires (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) , a city with a humid subtropical climate, they were RSV, influenza A, Adenovirus, and parainfluenza [9] .

            "text": "The migration of influenza has been investigated in great detail recently using time-stamped viral sequences. These studies show that influenza does indeed frequently migrate from hotter to colder geographical regions. For example, the data of Bedford et al. shows that 50% of European A/H3N2 influenza strains were descended from strains that were in tropical or subtropical regions one year earlier [19] . For A/H1N1, B/Victoria-like and B/Yamagata-like influenza strains, the proportions were 62%, 17% and 32% respectively [19] . A/H3N2 influenza, in particular, circulates continuously in East and Southeast Asia, and spreads to temperate regions from this network [19, 20] , so we would certainly expect it to have properties that allow it to be active during temperate summers. The predominant direction of migration of influenza in China is also of interest. On a one-year timescale, H3N2, H1N1, and B/Yamagata/16/1988-like influenza were more likely to migrate from South to North China than in the opposite direction [19] . (The trend is not universal, however: B/Victoria/2/1987-like influenza was more likely to migrate from North to South China [19] .) Note also that influenza and other vARIs often show clear [7] . This remarkable figure requires scientific explanation. The antigenic changes in influenza A virus (occurring at both sites) clearly show that novel influenza strains repeatedly moved across Europe during the period shown. There is, however, no evidence of moving ''waves\" of influenza because epidemics at the two sites are almost perfectly closely synchronized. Note that the shortest route between the two sites covers 1400 km by sea and road, crosses four national boundaries, and passes through some of the most densely-populated regions of Europe. This suggests that the virus moved to both sites prior to its manifestation, and a stimulus that was present at both sites triggered the concurrent epidemics. Bear in mind, however, that some influenza infections do not cause fevers. Influenza may have spread across Europe in the form of colds, before being strongly activated by low temperatures to yield febrile illness. These data are most readily explained by the fourth mechanism discussed below (M4), that virions can become dormant at some unknown location in the respiratory tract, and can subsequently be activated by host chilling. M3, which suggests that colder conditions weaken the immune defenses of hosts is also a possible explanation, but the very sudden onset of influenza in both locations is difficult to explain in this way. \u00d31981.

The strange global and seasonal distribution of influenza and other vARIs is shown schematically in Fig. 4 . These issues were discussed in two recent reviews of influenza seasonality, both of which also noted the lack of a satisfactory explanation [1, 2] .",

It is highly improbable that this common trend is coincidental, and this review will assume that an unrecognized common thread runs through the transmission or replication of respiratory viruses. If it were possible, more consistent conclusions might be arrived at by focusing instead on particular vARIs, but unfortunately the relevant data are not yet available. I will therefore consider influenza, the best-studied vARI, as well as colds and other vARIs, always bearing in mind that important differences may exist between the various viral species considered.",

In the UK, Hajat et al. found that general practitioner consultations by elderly patients for lower respiratory tract infections in one UK City (Norwich) increased by 19% for every degree that average temperature dropped below 5\u00b0C, observed 0-20 days before the consultation [14] . Absolute temperature, however, is not correlated with vARIs in a simple way. For example, we do not see a vARI that is limited to all global regions or seasons where temperatures never rise above, say, 15\u00b0C (Fig. 4) . Instead, evidence from many different sources shows that vARI incidence is related to temperature fluctuations. For example, van Loghem conducted a very extensive survey of vARIs in the winter of 1925/26 with 6933 participants from all regions of the Netherlands [5] . His data is shown in Fig. 1 , together with the temperatures recorded by five Dutch weather stations. Epidemics of vARIs in all seven regions were very closely synchronized with each other, and closely showing the highest rates of infection. The figure shows general trends rather than specific data, but it is compatible with e.g. the Weekly Epidemiological Record of influenza A of the World Health Organization [7] and other studies [1] . The yellow curve shows the path of vertical solar radiation. The strange distribution of vARIs is shown, with more vARIs in the tropics throughout the year than in temperate regions during the summer months [1, 2, 20] . It is known that seed strains of influenza A (H3N2) circulate continuously in a network in East and Southeast Asia (blue arrows) and spread to temperate regions from this network (green arrows) [20] . Many studies show that personal chilling increases the prevalence of vARIs [5, [14] [15] [16] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , and, since travel away from the tropical regions is associated with a decrease in temperature, it is likely that vARIs spread more quickly from the tropics to temperate regions (green arrows) than in the opposite direction (dotted red arrow). This is indeed the case for H3N2 influenza [20] . The degree to which viruses remain dormant during the summer in temperate regions (dotted purple arrow) is unknown. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) correlated with inverted temperature with roughly a one week lag (i.e. lower temperatures were associated with increased vARIs). These correlations were strongest during the period when temperatures were generally falling, i.e. the first half of the cold season. Note also that the highest infection rate, which occurred at the start of the study, coincided with almost the highest temperature in the study. Just prior to the start of the study, however, the temperature declined after remaining nearly steady during the summer months -implying that the temperature dip triggered the epidemic. This emphasizes that we need to consider temperature fluctuations rather than absolute temperature levels.",

Between mid-afternoon and midnight each day the temperature on the island fell sharply by 5-7\u00b0C. When the temperature dipped in the autumn by 1.5\u00b0C (green bar) below the summer range, an epidemic of colds was triggered. More recently, Jaakkola et al. found that ''sudden declines\" in both air temperature and absolute humidity (in the three days that preceded the reporting of the sickness) increased the incidence of influenza A and B in military conscripts in Northern Finland [22] . Paradoxically, the incidence of influenza was lower at very low temperatures, and it was the sudden decline of temperature rather than low absolute temperature (and, the authors suggested, the decline of humidity) that increased the risk of influenza.",

            "text": "Historical studies have some advantages over modern investigations. The study by van Loghem was on a scale that would be difficult today, and he was able to collect data from multiple geographical locations within the Netherlands (Fig. 1) . The study by Milam and Smillie has the advantage that the island was very isolated, so that a limited set of viruses was studied (Fig. 5 ). Modern studies, however, have the great advantage that they can identify the viral species involved. Two recent studies in Argentina and Germany compared weather parameters with hospital admissions of children suffering from known vARIs [4, 9] . Both studies found that the combined number of cases for all pathogens was strongly inversely correlated with outside temperature. Viegas et al. plotted the frequencies of RSV, adenovirus, influenza A virus and parainfluenza virus alongside mean temperature in Buenos Aires [9] . On all plots clear seasonality is apparent, but adenovirus and parainfluenza virus clearly lagged behind inverted temperature, peaking in early spring. Du Prel et al. presented similar plots and reported that rhinovirus, RSV, influenza A, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, influenza B and coronavirus were all strongly inversely correlated with temperature in Mainz, Germany (p < 0.001 in all cases). Rhinovirus was also correlated with relative humidity (p < 0.001) [4] . This study (and the Buenos Aires study) used Spearman's ranked correlation coefficients to find associations between meteorological parameters and hospitalizations for viral (and bacterial) infections [4, 9] . This tabular information is difficult to interpret, however, because correlation coefficients dramatically underestimate the closeness of a relationship when one of the parameters lags behind the other (e.g. if two data sets are perfectly correlated except that one lags by a quarter of a cycle, the correlation coefficient will be 0). It is therefore possible that associations with temperature were present in Mainz for enterovirus, parainfluenza types 1 and 3, Mycoplasma and Chlamydophila, but not made evident by the correlation coefficients that the authors calculated. For example, rhinovirus in Mainz had a Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient with inverted temperature of only 0.42, but inspection of the plots shows a clear relationship, with the first rhinovirus epidemic of each season closely following the first major drop in temperature at the end of summer [4] . We can conclude that both papers show important correlations with weather, although other important relationships may not have been fully revealed by the analysis. It is also apparent that vARIs caused by completely unrelated viruses share the same seasonality both in a city with a humid subtropical climate, and in a city with an oceanic climate. It is very unlikely that these relationships are purely coincidental, which emphasizes that we should look for common causes of seasonality in these and other vARIs.",

Since indoor temperatures in wealthy societies are maintained, by heating systems, at roughly constant levels throughout the year, indoor relative humidity is roughly determined by outdoor absolute humidity. Variations in absolute humidity may therefore contribute to influenza seasonality in some instances. Several points need to be considered, however: (1) reports of the effect of relative humidity on the survival of influenza virions at room temperature are inconsistent. Whereas Harper found that roughly twice as many viable PR8 virions were recovered after storage at 50% relative humidity in comparison to 64% [27] , Schaffer et al. saw the opposite trend with their WSN virions from cell cultures, with roughly an order of magnitude lower recovery of virions at 50% relative humidity in comparison to 65% [28] . (2) Influenza and most other vARI epidemics are more frequent in the tropics during the rainy season, when both relative and absolute humidity levels are high [1, 10] . For example, Fortaleza in Brazil has a single large peak of influenza [1] (and, from personal experience, other vARIs) that coincides with the rainy season (January to July). (3) Animal experiments with guinea pigs show that, while transmission of influenza generally decreased with increasing relative humidity, it actually increased at 20\u00b0C when relative humidity moved from 50% to 65% [29] . (Animal experiments with influenza are further discussed below.)",

However other interpretations are possible: increased relative humidity is associated with rainfall, which can wet individuals' clothing and cause chilling. Moreover, as noted above, indoor relative humidity in temperate climates is much lower in winter than in summer due to the effects of artificial heating in winter [3] . Changes in the survival of rhinoviruses due to indoor relative humidity should therefore generate the opposite seasonality if transmission mainly occurs indoors, which seems likely.",

            "text": "Experiments with guinea pigs suggest that the transmission of influenza A is more efficient at lower temperatures and lower relative humidity [29] . Lowen et al. found a 3.5-fold increase in the transmission of human influenza A between guinea pigs at 5\u00b0C compared to at 20\u00b0C [29] (in fact this was true only at 50% relative humidity; at higher and lower humidity, transmission rates were either similar at both temperatures or higher at 20\u00b0C). These differences are in agreement with measurements of the stability of influenza A virions generated in cell cultures in air of different temperatures and humidities [27, 28] . This might suggest that variations in transmission due to weather changes might determine or influence the seasonality of influenza (and other vARIs) in temperate regions. The results were, however, inconsistent; for example, transmission of influenza at 20\u00b0C was higher at 65% relative humidity that at 50% [29] . Moreover, a more recent study found that the transmission of influenza between guinea pigs by medium-range aerosol was eliminated at 30\u00b0C, although transfer between animals in the same enclosure by short-range aerosol or direct contact was as efficient at 30\u00b0C as at 20\u00b0C [30] . The authors postulate that the normal mode of influenza transmission varies depending on climate: in temperate regions aerosol transmission may predominate, while in the tropics short-range and contact transmission may be more important. Epidemics of H3N2 influenza in the temperate regions are, however, seeded each year from a network of temporarily overlapping epidemics in East and Southeast Asia [20] . There is therefore no reason why influenza cannot be transmitted by the contact route in the summer months into and within the temperate regions. Lowen et al. recognize this difficulty, and they postulate the existence of unknown ''additional factors, other than warm temperature and high relative humidity, which suppress influenza transmission by all routes during the summer months\" in temperate regions [30] . Although the authors may have identified the important routes of influenza transmission at different latitudes, they have therefore not provided a robust explanation of its seasonality.",

Other respiratory viruses show similar behavior, sometimes on shorter timescales. Morikawa et al. found human parechovirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus 229E and HKU1, and rhinovirus in the gargle specimens of eight asymptomatic children using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests [34] . The tests required at least 100 copies of the genetic material, suggesting that the viruses in question had begun to replicate [34] . However, the authors noted that it is difficult to interpret PCR results because it is a very sensitive method, and the positive results may reflect an asymptomatic past or concurrent infection, or an imminent infection. Their data suggest, however, that at least some were imminent infections: four of the children had positive results when they were asymptomatic that were followed four weeks later by a vARI that was associated with the same virus (or a strain that was indistinguishable using the PCR test); rhinovirus was detected in a fifth child who was at first asymptomatic, but experienced the symptoms of a cold caused by rhinovirus one week later. Similarly, viral dormancy may explain the sudden arrival of autumn epidemics of rhinovirus in temperate regions; Granados et al. studied rhinovirus activity in university students, and showed that asymptomatic rhinovirus activity preceded peak symptomatic activity in September and October and was associated with lower viral load [18] .",

For example, after 12 months of complete isolation in 1965/6, a geologist (''J.E. H.\") at the Mawson station picked up a respiratory virus from a visiting field party [24] . 17 days later he and three colleagues were exposed to cold and damp conditions, which brought on vARI symptoms including muscle aches and a sore throat in J.E.H. and two of his colleagues. Another study at Adelaide Island in 1969 found that after 17 weeks of complete isolation several men developed colds four days after the air temperature fell in one day from 0\u00b0C to \u00c024\u00b0C [25] . Both studies suggest that chilling caused by particular activities or weather changes can activate dormant virions, giving rise to vARIs. Similarly, Muchmore et al. reported parainfluenza shedding by healthy young adults throughout the 8\u00bd-month winter isolation period at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station during 1978 [39] . The study recorded two episodes of respiratory illness caused by parainfluenza at the Station that year after 10 and 29 weeks of complete social isolation.",

Another negative observation is that festivals and sporting events are not associated with increased vARIs. For example, during the FIFA World Cup people spend more time indoors and often crowd together in bars etc. to watch matches on television, but no significant increase is apparent in Google Flu Search Activity in any country in the Northern Hemisphere during the 2014 FIFA World Cup [42].

            "text": "Firstly, this explanation cannot explain why vARIs are present in many tropical regions all year round, but virtually absent from temperate regions during the summer months. If respiratory virions can adequately survive outside the body in the tropics, they should have no difficulty in surviving (according to this explanation) in the milder conditions of temperate summers. As noted above, a similar set of viruses give rise to vARIs that hospitalized children in temperate, subtropical and tropical cities [4, 9, 10] , and they presumably migrate between these locations. Seed strains of influenza A (H3N2) spread from East and Southeast Asia to temperate regions every year [20] , and other respiratory viruses may follow similar routes. (The suggestion [22, 28, 29] that low absolute or relative humidity may increase viral survival does not help, because vARI epidemics occur during the rainy season in many tropical locations [1] .) Secondly, consider van Loghem's data [5] (Fig. 1) . While temperatures were generally decreasing (i.e. up to the end of January) vARIs were very well-correlated with inverted temperature, and extraordinarily well-synchronized across the country, with no evidence of ''waves\" of infection moving between different locations, which would be expected if cold temperatures increased transmission during the study. We don't know which viruses were most prevalent in the study, but if any had seasonality that was driven by M2 it is clear that they were not common. Hope-Simpson made similar observations when he compared influenza epidemics in the UK and in Prague, Czechoslovakia, showing the temporal correspondence of epidemics at widely separated localities at a similar latitude [7] (see Fig. 2 ). In another example, Magrassi was impressed by cases of influenza in 1948 among shepherds living in complete social isolation in open country in Sardinia, who developed the disease contemporaneously with the inhabitants of towns on the same island [6] .",

For example, the rapid drop in temperature during weeks 6-8 of van Loghem's study (pink band, labeled i1 in Fig. 1 ) was followed, with a lag of roughly one week, by rapid increases in vARIs. When the temperature subsequently hovered around 0\u00b0C in weeks 9 and 10 (yellow band, labeled i2), however, the number of vARIs stabilized. If the rapid 70% increase in vARIs that occurred at temperatures between 10 and 0\u00b0C (pink band) was caused by increased transmission we would then expect vARIs to continue to increase when temperatures stabilized around 0\u00b0C. A little later (weeks 12 and 13, blue band, labeled i3) the temperature was well below 0\u00b0C, but now it was rising, and the vARIs fell from their highs, again emphasizing that vARIs tend to be sensitive to temperature fluctuations rather than absolute temperature.",

Milam and Smillie's data (Fig. 5 ) also showed fast-acting sensitivity to very small temperature drops outside the recent range, with these events occurring at a range of temperatures throughout the year [21] . Jaakkola et al. reported that ''sudden declines\" of around 5\u00b0C preceded the onset of influenza in Northern Finland [22] , occurring at temperatures above 15\u00b0C and also below \u00c015\u00b0C. Other vARIs can be considered. An interesting and clear-cut example comes from Singapore, where Hii et al. studied the strong association of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) with the weather [11] . The risk of the disease increased by 41% for every 1\u00b0C that the weekly temperature difference increased above 7\u00b0C. The authors concede that the ''exact reasons for the relationship between weather and HFMD are not known\" [11] . Again, it is difficult to imagine that weather anomalies of the order of 1\u00b0C can significantly change the survival of respiratory viruses outside the body (or, indeed, the susceptibility of human hosts to VRTIs, discussed in the next section).",

This is a very interesting but puzzling result, and the authors offer no explanation of the possible benefits to the mouse. If airway cells possess mechanisms that can reduce infections, it seems strange that they should be down-regulated at lower temperatures. (One explanation is that the interferons severely damage airway cells, and the mouse prefers to deal with the virus with milder defenses unless it reaches sites where it may cause serious illness. A related proposal is that mice permit the growth of viruses in their respiratory tracts in order to raise antibodies against them before the virus can reach the internal organs.) We need to wait for equivalent results in the cells of other species, both in vitro and in vivo, before we can fully interpret these data.",

Great sensitivity to temperature fluctuations is apparent, however. For example, consider again Chart 1 of Milam and Smillie's paper [21] (Fig. 5) . Every night in the summer the temperature dropped by 5-7\u00b0C. In the autumn the temperature fell by an extra 1.5\u00b0C, which triggered an epidemic of colds.

[7] ). In at least one case it was clear that this was not due to a lack of susceptible persons: the H2N2 subtype arrived explosively for the first time in Cirencester in September 1957, with over 100 individuals suffering from acute febrile respiratory diseases by the third week of October. This epidemic abruptly ceased after only six weeks. It is known for certain that many susceptible individuals remained in the town's population at that time because this was the first H2N2 epidemic, and there was another H2N2 epidemic 16 months later, which was almost as large as the first [7] . The abrupt cessation of the first epidemic is therefore unexplained. The other four major epidemics listed above were in midwinter, when (according to this view) the immune system should be at its weakest, suggesting that the virus should spread and the epidemic should continue for more than eight weeks.",

In 1979, Richman and Murphy confirmed this association and reviewed its implications for the development of live virus vaccines [58] . They noted that the replication of temperature-sensitive (ts) 1 influenza, parainfluenza, RSV, and foot-and-mouth viruses was consistently more restricted in the lungs of a variety of animals than in their nasal cavities. They also found that both naturally-occurring and synthetic ts viruses were very frequently less virulent than their non-ts counterparts in humans and animals, noting several cases (including influenza and vaccinia virus) where the loss of the ts phenotype resulted in the restoration of the virulence or growth capacity of the virus, both in vivo and in vitro [58] . Chu et al. later tested seven H1N1 strains with varying degrees of temperature sensitivity in volunteers and found a correlation between temperature sensitivity and the severity of symptoms, with strains that were more ts being less virulent [59] . It is reasonable to conclude that the ts phenotype facilitates the transmission of the wild virus because it prevents or reduces multiplication of the virus in the lungs or internal organs, which is likely to result in the immobilization, or possibly the death, of the host. One possible explanation of vARI seasonality (M4) is therefore that the lower temperatures of winter increase the activity and virulence of respiratory viruses, as a side-effect of their tropism. This may explain why nearly all respiratory viruses share the same seasonality.",

This can explain the data of van Loghem, Milam, Jaakkola and others, discussed above [5, [14] [15] [16] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . It can also explain the seasonality of vARIs, because chilling outside of the range of the previous few days or weeks becomes more likely when the seasonal temperature drops in the autumn. In the spring, by contrast, exceptional chilling becomes less frequent as the seasonal temperature steadily rises.",

It also provides an explanation for the strange epidemiology of influenza, including the low attack rate of many epidemics within families [5, [43] [44] [45] and the rapid cessation of epidemics when many susceptible individuals remain in the population [7] ; bear in mind that each member of a family has a different history of exposure to viruses and of chilling. For example, some family members may take regular outdoor exercise in the winter, which (I suggest) clears virions from the respiratory tract in small batches (outdoor exercise reduces mortality from vARIs [15] ). Other family members may be exposed to a virus for the first time during particularly cold weather (e.g. in midwinter), so that virions bind and become dormant relatively low down the respiratory tract, and are therefore not activated unless even colder weather follows. Still others, who remain indoors much of the time, but are chilled occasionally may be prime candidates for infection (e.g. waiting for a bus in the rain may put individuals at risk -standing still outside in cold weather, and shivering outside, have both been shown to be a dangerous activities [15] ). These trends can therefore explain the low attack rates and lack of transmission within families, as well as the rapid cessation of epidemics.",

(The absolute values of the regression coefficients of mortality due to respiratory disease on these two cold exposure factors were far higher than any others found by the Group.) The first point, that shivering increased mortality, could be explained by either M3 or M4 -host defenses could be diminished, or virions could be activated, by cold. The second point, that outdoor sweating reduced mortality, is more difficult to explain. Although heat stress may boost the immune system above its normal level, the result would not be noticeably protective if virions are dormant and therefore invisible to the immune system. If they were visible they should be destroyed anyway during the much greater time spent indoors. A roughly neutral effect of M3 would therefore be expected. M4 would suggest that mortality should increase, because outdoor exertion clearly causes cooling of the respiratory tract, due to rapid breathing. The best explanation may be a combination of M3 and M4: the cold air and rapid breathing cools of the respiratory tract, which activates some of the dormant virions that are present. However, the good blood flow to the respiratory tract that is associated with heat stress allows the activated virions to be destroyed by the immune system.",

This belief seems to come from numerous studies from the 1950s and 1960s where volunteers who had been inoculated with respiratory viruses were chilled, including three influential reports by Andrewes, Dowling and Douglas [53] [54] [55] . Unfortunately, these studies generally used ''pedigree\" strains of cold virus that were recycled by being collected from volunteers and used to inoculate subsequent batches of volunteers in later experiments. (Volunteers were often kept in quarantine to avoid using natural ''wild\" strains that they happened to be carrying [53] .) In these studies it seems likely the researchers selected strains that very quickly caused mild vARIs in a significant proportion of the volunteers -but without causing dangerous infections. This may well have removed some aspects of their natural temperature sensitivity, since temperature sensitivity might give rise to dormancy and thereby delay infection. This suggests that the results may have differed from those that would have been obtained using wild viruses, which might have shown an effect of chilling. One study, however, by Jackson et al., did use wild viruses that the volunteers were carrying [56] . In some of their experiments, volunteers in scant dress were exposed to 15.5\u00b0C air for four hours. In others, warmlydressed volunteers breathed air at \u00c012\u00b0C for two hours. Of those who were chilled, only 10% developed colds in the next 7 days, whereas 12% of those who were not chilled developed colds. However, the authors do not tells us what proportion of volunteers were chilled by breathing cold air and what proportion by wearing scant clothing; breathing cold air while remaining warm can be protective [15] , presumably because viruses are activated but they can be removed by the immune system.",

The observed effect on temperature sensitivity of natural and (spontaneous) laboratory selection for increased and decreased viral activity. In this schematic 2-d plot the Xs indicate the starting levels of activity (virulence) and temperature sensitivity of two hypothetical viral strains. (The Xs could also indicate the properties of hypothetical viral proteins). Selective pressures are indicated by dotted arrows, while the resulting changes to viral phenotype are indicated by solid arrows. The establishment of persistent viral infections of cell cultures generally requires reduced viral activity so that viral and cell replication can be in balance [58, 69] . The corresponding selective pressure is indicated by the dotted red arrow. Unexpectedly, reduced activity is often (though not always) accompanied by the spontaneous appearance of temperature (heat) sensitivity. This is indicated by the solid red arrow. See the main text for examples [70] [71] [72] . The converse trend is equally surprising: when ts viruses are propagated in conditions that allow rapid growth (thereby selecting the most active mutants, dotted blue arrow), heat sensitivity has been lost (solid blue arrow) even when selection takes place at low temperatures (see main text [59, 74] ). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) speculate that their temperature sensitivity may allow insectborne viruses to target the skin.) Similarly, Richman and Murphy found that persistent infections of cell-cultures with mumps virus and vesicular stomatitis virus frequently yielded ts virus, although they noted that persistent infections could also be established or maintained by non-ts mutations [58] . Three more recent reports described the recovery of spontaneously-generated ts strains of influenza A from persistent infections of cell cultures [70] [71] [72] . Similar tendencies are seen in persistent infections of animals; footand-mouth viruses recovered from carrier animals are frequently ts, and show evidence of high rates of mutation with frequent amino acid substitutions and rapid antigenic variation [73] .",

They do not, however, explain why ts mutations in particular should be selected in persistent infections, as opposed to non-ts attenuating mutations. In most cases the cells were grown in the laboratory at 37\u00b0C, so temperature sensitivity should be a disadvantage. If, however, the wild virus from which the laboratory strain was derived was ts, the probability of reverting to the ts phenotype may be relatively high. For example, a protein might lose its ts character by a point mutation caused by a single nucleotide change, so that the ts character could be restored by reinstating the original nucleotide. This may be more probable than other mutations that would attenuate the virus without conferring temperature sensitivity. Changes to RNA secondary structure (discussed below) may have similar effects. Bear in mind that many virus families include species that cause both systemic and respiratory tract infections, and strains may have jumped between these sites many times in their evolutionary history. For example influenza often infects the gut in birds, but it usually infects the respiratory tract in mammals. These considerations suggest that genetic pathways may exist that allow the rapid elimination and reintroduction of temperature sensitivity.",

A tropical virus might cause serious illness if it arrives in colder parts of the world, because it might infect sites lower down the respiratory tract. Since too much virulence may reduce viral transmission (as patients become bed-ridden), natural selection in the temperate site for reduced virulence may increase temperature sensitivity to a level that is appropriate to the virus's new location. A similar argument suggests that viral temperature sensitivity (and virulence) may be adjusted throughout the year by natural selection to a level that is appropriate to the season.",

Chu et al. found a naturallyoccurring ts influenza A strain that was a subclone of the H3N2 strain Ningxia/11/72 [59] . When they passaged the strain three times through chicken embryos at a low temperature (33\u00b0C), they were surprised to find that a non-ts strain was produced. Similarly, Oxford et al. [74] found that a naturally occurring ts virus, A/Eng/116/78 (H1N1), progressively lost its ts character during five passages at low temperature (33\u00b0C). Both groups concluded that even at the permissive temperature (33\u00b0C) the ts phenotype may confer a selective disadvantage in eggs -which allow rapid replication of influenza virions. Again we can speculate that viru-lence and greater viral activity in general is genetically linked to temperature sensitivity as a result of the evolutionary history of the virus.",

Coronaviruses were first isolated at 33\u00b0C [78] although laboratory strains are now frequently propagated at 37\u00b0C. Naturally occurring influenza strains are also frequently ts. For example, in 1962 Stern and Tippett [79] propagated four viral specimens from patients with H2N2 ''Asian\" influenza, all of which were ts. All four gave cytopathic effects in monkey cells and the production of hemagglutinatinin-positive fluids in eggs at 33\u00b0C but not at 37\u00b0C. Subcultures were able to adapt to culture at 37\u00b0C but grew more slowly than at 33\u00b0C. The authors also found (in 1962) that the FM1 (H1N1, 1947) and PR8 (old-style H0N1, 1934) strains grew more slowly in monkey cells at 37\u00b0C than at 33\u00b0C.

Oxford et al. found that 17 of 26 recent H1N1 isolates, and 2 of 11 recent H3N2 isolates were ts, producing cultures that gave at least 10 times more viral plaques after incubation at 34\u00b0C compared to 38.5\u00b0C [74] .",

In 1977, Plotch and Krug [61] reported that the greatest activity of the RNA polymerase of WSN virus was at 30-32\u00b0C. This is similar to the optimum temperature of the polymerase of influenza C, which is 33\u00b0C [62, 63] . Ulmanen et al. [64] found that the rate of transcription by detergent-treated WSN viruses (influenza A) was about 10 times greater at 33\u00b0C than at 39.5\u00b0C, and also that the binding of a cleaved primer cap (the ''A13 fragment\") to the viral cores was ''unexpectedly\" much weaker at 39.5\u00b0C than at 33\u00b0C. Scholtissek and Rott [65] showed that the optimum for the polymerase of the Rostock strain of fowl plague virus was 36\u00b0C, five degrees below chickens' normal body temperature (41\u00b0C). At least two reports show that temperature affects the balance between transcription and viral replication. Kashiwagi et al. looked at the effect of temperature on RNA production for five varied influenza A strains [66] . For all strains, vRNA unexpectedly decreased when the temperature was increased from 37\u00b0C to 42\u00b0C. The PA subunit of the viral polymerase caused this thermal sensitivity. In another interesting study, Dalton et al. showed that the production of mRNA by the PR8 influenza strain is favored at a higher temperature (41\u00b0C), with very little vRNA being produced at that temperature [67] . A plasmid-based recombinant system showed that as the incubation temperature increased from 31\u00b0C to 39\u00b0C the amount of replicative RNA products (c-and vRNA) decreased and a greater accumulation of mRNA was observed. The cRNA that is used as a template to make the vRNA formed a complex with the polymerase that was particularly heat-labile, showing rapid dissociation even at 37\u00b0C. The authors suggested that the ''switch\" that regulates the transition from transcription to replication is dependent on temperature, but made no comments about how shifts in the host's body or respiratory tract temperature may influence this transition.",

They are frequently (but not always) found in the 5'-untranslated regions of mRNA, and can act in both directions -translation can be augmented or suppressed at high temperatures [81] . Chursov et al. used bioinformatic techniques to search for pronounced differences between mRNA from cold-adapted ts influenza strains and the corresponding wild-type sequences [82] . Pronounced differences were found in the mRNAs of four viral proteins.

Many or most respiratory viruses possess temperature sensitivity, and we can imagine that a respiratory virus that loses its temperature sensitivity might infect the lungs, gut or internal organs. (Some method of limiting virulence other than temperature sensitivity might then be selected that can allow the virus to survive in the long-term.) Conversely, viruses originating in the internal organs that develop temperature sensitivity could safely cause severe local infections that would be limited to the upper respiratory tract (possibly in addition to other cold parts of the body such as the feet), without greatly incapacitating the host (incapacitation would limit opportunities for transmission of the virus). Obviously the resulting irritation of the respiratory tract might cause coughing, sneezing and runny noses, all of which might help to transmit the virus -in other words a respiratory virus has been generated. Influenza infects the gut of water fowl but the respiratory tract of mammals (and birds), and is able to move between these two ecological niches. Similarly, some adenovirus serotypes are mainly respiratory, others mainly cause gut-related disease. Viruses that are transmitted via skin rashes and blisters that burst, such as chickenpox, measles, smallpox, and hand, foot and mouth disease in humans, and foot-andmouth disease in cloven-hoofed mammals, could also benefit from temperature sensitivity that might allow them to infect the skin preferentially and so to spread by direct contact. (In the diseases mentioned above contact transmission from blisters etc. coexists with aerosol transmission.) Several examples indicate that what we think of as respiratory viruses can occasionally cause systemic infections: virulent human influenza strains sometimes give rise to viremia [84, 85] , and three children who were infected with pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009 (''swine flu\") presented with petechial rashes [86] . Similarly, 33 patients presented with hemorrhagic cystitis caused by H3N2 influenza A in 1975 [87] .",

An alternative suggestion (M3), that chilled hosts are more susceptible as a result of ts changes to their immune defenses, is a better candidate. A biochemical study using cultured mouse cells supports the idea [51] , and M3 also seems to be part of the best explanation of the protective effect of winter outdoor exercise [15] . However, evidence from vaccination studies, epidemiological evidence that vARIs respond to small temperature changes throughout a wide range of absolute temperatures (Figs. 1  and 3) , and evidence that vARIs frequently appear simultaneously throughout large geographical regions (Figs. 1 and 2) , seem to rule out changes in host susceptibility as the main driver of vARI seasonality.",

This explanation is seldom considered by microbiologists, who seem to have ruled it out on the basis of historical reports from the 1950s and 1960s, which concluded that chilling does not bring on vARIs [53] [54] [55] [56] . However, there is now so much clear evidence that chilling does increase vARIs that we need to look more closely at those historical experiments. I suggest above that they were flawed because they generally used ''pedigree\" viral strains which were passed by the investigators from volunteers to subsequent batches of volunteers in later experiments. Obviously the investigators would have thought carefully about the choice of strains that they used; they certainly didn't want to put the volunteers at risk, so mild strains needed to be selected. However they naturally wanted their experiments to fit into the time available -for example Andrewes worked with volunteers who each stayed at his unit for 10 days, and his experiments did not start until the volunteers had been in quarantine for three days. The incubation period of the strain that he used was most frequently two to three days. By selecting such a strain he and his colleagues may have eliminated the virus's natural temperature sensitivity during the early stages of infection (temperature sensitivity that is predicted by M4) -a flaw in the design of his experiments with potentially far-reaching implications.",

Epidemiological evidence shows that (a) surges in vARIs often follow a few days after temperature dips (even minor dips) [2, 3, 5, 14, 21, 22] ; (b) in all climates, it is temperature drops that are generally associated with vARI epidemics rather than sustained low absolute temperature [3, 5, 21, 22] ; (c) the attack rate and the rate of transmission within families are often low, especially for influenza [5, [43] [44] [45] ; (d) vARI epidemics often appear simultaneously throughout wide geographical areas, with no evidence of waves of transmission that move between neighboring (Fig. 1 ) or widely separated (Fig. 2) localities [5] [6] [7] ; and (e) influenza epidemics often occur in midwinter but cease while many susceptible individuals remain in the population [7] . All of these observations are compatible with M4, as discussed above. Moreover, observations of the timing and location of vARI epidemics suggest that respiratory viruses can become dormant, a suggestion that is confirmed by the occasional presence of vARIs in polar communities after many weeks or months of complete isolation [24, 25, 39] . Biochemical tests of asymptomatic individuals who shed influenza A and B without seroconversion [35] [36] [37] [38] are compatible with dormancy, and PCR tests showed directly that individuals harboring a variety of viral pathogens subsequently developed the corresponding vARIs [18, 34] . If we accept this evidence of viral dormancy and reactivation, then the idea (M4) that chilling increases the activity of respiratory viruses that were present before the epidemic began can provide the rapid response, sensitivity to temperature dips, and occasional lack of transmission that we need to explain the epidemiological events (a-e) above. It is unclear how these events can be explained by the alternative mechanisms M1 -M3.",

            "text": "We also need to explain the clear trend in the laboratory for persistent infections of cells to yield ts strains of a variety of viruses in the absence of obvious selective pressures [58, [69] [70] [71] [72] , and also the converse observation, that temperature sensitivity is lost when viruses are grown in cell cultures at low temperature in conditions that allow rapid replication [59, 74] (Fig. 6) . Moreover, biochemical studies show that many steps in the replication of laboratory strains of influenza and other viruses have residual natural temperature sensitivity [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] 83] , in spite of many cycles of replication of most laboratory viruses at 37\u00b0C. We can explain these data by suggesting a link between loss of temperature sensitivity and the acquisition of increased virulence in respiratory viruses, which seems to be a legacy of their evolutionary history. Lwoff (1959) , and Richman and Murphy (1979) suggested that the temperature sensitivity of respiratory viruses allows them to target the respiratory tract, and to avoid the lungs [57, 58] . This idea, and the related idea that less ts strains tend to be more viru-lent, seems to be widely accepted by microbiologists. However, the corollary, that ambient temperature dips can activate viruses that were previously inactive, is less popular. It is, however compatible with the well-known ''trade-off\" model of virulence. This model suggests that the benefits of virulence (in particular the increased rate of virus production and shedding) are balanced against the reduction of the time during which shedding takes place (and also changes to the behavior of hosts that reduce transmission) if virulence is too great. The implication is that mechanisms are required to moderate virulence, and temperature sensitive mechanisms can clearly achieve this in the case of respiratory viruses. An analogy in the form of a joke may be helpful here. Two scientists are out hiking, when they meet an angry-looking bear. ''It's no use,\" says one scientist to the other, ''you can never outrun a bear\". ''I don't need to outrun the bear,\" replies his companion, ''I only need to outrun you\". It is often assumed that an ''evolutionary arms race\" exists between viruses and the host immune system, with each making a series of small improvements to gain an advantage over the other [88] . This assumption may be incorrect -it may be that most viruses could easily overcome the defenses of hosts that lack specific immunity, but that selective pressures nevertheless reduce the virulence of well-adapted viruses, as predicted by the trade-off model. Some of the evidence for this comes from viruses that have recently jumped from one host species to another, such as myxomatosis in European rabbits, and, in humans, HIV, SARS, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, avian influenza and Ebola. These viruses are unusually virulent, in spite of -or because of -having had little time to adapt to their hosts. The main arms race may not be between viruses and hosts, but between competing hosts, where each needs to reduce its susceptibility to outcompete other members of the same species.",

            "text": "It is unlikely that either evidence gleaned from studies that were designed to investigate other aspects of viral biochemistry or epidemiological observations can determine the causes of vARI seasonality with certainty. Instead it will be necessary to investigate temperature sensitivity directly in vivo and in vitro, working with viruses that are as close as possible to wild viruses. As a start, wild and laboratory viral samples should be ''deep sequenced\" (i.e. the relative proportions of different sequences in a sample should be established at multiple genetic sites) to determine the mix of ts and non-ts sequences in wild samples, and to establish the impact on temperature sensitivity of propagating wild viruses in the laboratory. This analysis needs to include consideration of RNA secondary structure. The information gained can be applied at many levels, from observations and experiments with living organisms to experiments with cell cultures and in solution. It may be possible to image the distribution of virions in the respiratory tracts of animals, and to see e.g. differences in animals that were housed at high and low temperatures prior to the investigation. Virions might be released from tissues or cells by raising the temperature, or captured by lowering the temperature. (Note that the genetic information remains attached to the chemical probe, in a manner analogous to the phage display technique.) The entry of virions into cells can be investigated by measuring the escape rate of preadsorbed virus from neutralization by antibody in temperature shift experiments [60] . In tissue cultures, transcription and the production of genetic material can be followed during temperature shifts (for example the production of mRNA, cRNA and vRNA can each be studied in influenza). Similarly, the production of viral proteins can be followed during temperature-shift experiments. Experiments in solution can also yield valuable information. For example, the thermal stability of mutants of influenza hemagglutinin and neuraminidase can be investigated in solution by thermal shift assays, and similar experiments can be undertaken with other respiratory viruses. The thermal stability of secondary structures of wild-type and laboratory viral RNA and RNA/protein complexes can be measured in solution. Bioinformatics can be applied to the problem. For example the sequences of hemagglutinin, neuraminidase and other viral proteins from wild and laboratory strains, and from the viruses obtained from different animal hosts and laboratory procedures can be analyzed. This analysis can consider the impact of mutations on the structures of viral proteins and complexes that have been determined by X-ray crystallography and other techniques. For example the effect of changing a particular residue can be anticipated or investigated experimentally. Secondary structure prediction techniques can be applied to viral RNA, DNA and protein/nucleic acid complexes. Yet another approach is to investigate and model viral epidemiology with these ideas in mind. Finally, experiments can be performed at the whole organism level. For example, chilblains and chapped lips can be examined for the presence of respiratory and other viruses. Other, very simple, experiments can be performed with human volunteers. For example, groups of volunteers can be subjected to chilling in the autumn or midwinter (which are the seasons when individuals are particularly susceptible to vARIs) and compared to control groups who are kept warm. The number of vARIs suffered by both groups can then be compared. This approach would make use of dormant viruses that the participants were already carrying by chance.",

I worked with Professor David Blow in the 1990s, and have published 15 papers about protein crystallization that have together been cited over 750 times. A few years ago I began to think about respiratory viruses when a friend bet me that I couldn't find biochemical evidence that chilling could trigger vARIs. I started to write a short note, but everything fell into place so neatly that it rapidly grew into the current document.",
