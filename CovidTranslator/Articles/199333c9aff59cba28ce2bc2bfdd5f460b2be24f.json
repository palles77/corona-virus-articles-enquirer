The collection efficiency of a DBD reactor is an important factor for determining a reactor's removal efficiency. Without considering collection, simply defining the inactivation efficiency based on colony counting numbers for DBD as on and off may lead to overestimation of the inactivation efficiency of the DBD reactor. One-pass removal tests of bioaerosols were carried out to deduce the inactivation efficiency of the DBD reactor using both aerosol-and colony-counting methods. Our DBD reactor showed good performance for removing test bioaerosols for an applied voltage of 7.5 kV and a residence time of 0.24 s, with \u00c1 CFU , \u00c1 Number , and \u00c1 Inactivation values of 94%, 64%, and 83%, respectively. Additionally, we introduce the susceptibility constant of bioaerosols to DBD as a quantitative parameter for the performance evaluation of a DBD reactor. The modified susceptibility constant, which is the ratio of the susceptibility constant to the volume of the plasma reactor, has been successfully demonstrated for the performance evaluation of different sized DBD reactors under different DBD operating conditions. Our methodology will be used for design optimization, performance evaluation, and prediction of power consumption of DBD for industrial applications.",

[13] , nonthermal plasma generated by a wireto-plate type DBD reactor was applied to inactivate aerosolized B. subtilis cells and Pseudomonas fluorescence as well as indoor and outdoor bioaerosols. Less than 2% of B. subtilis aerosols survived a plasma treatment of 0.12 s, while none of the P. fluorescens aerosols survived. Exposure of environmental bacterial aerosols to the plasma for 0.06 s also resulted in significant inactivation of more than 95% for bacteria. Gallagher et al. [14] demonstrated a 97% reduction in culturable E. coli with a millisecond exposure time in a dielectric barrier grating discharge (DBGD) plasma (one pass through discharge), and a subsequent 99.95% reduction 2 min following treatment. The direct plasma exposure time of 0.73 ms (per pass) allows enough time for bacteria to be attacked by all chemically active components of plasma (charged particles, OH radicals, atomic oxygen, and ozone), which is one explanation for the initial 97% reduction in culturability. Remote exposure to the remaining ozone in the subsequent 2 min direct plasma treatment may account for the additional 99.95% reduction. Vaze et al. [15] suggested that in their DBGD experiment, the main cause of inactivation is the synergetic action of short-lived plasma agents (charges, radicals) and ozone. This synergy creates a toxic environment for the bacteria, ultimately resulting in inactivation.",

Moreover, for industrial applications, quantitative parameters are needed for design optimization, performance evaluation and prediction of power consumption of DBD systems. As one quantitative parameter, susceptibility has been applied in numerical models to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of an upper-room UVGI (ultraviolet germicidal irradiation) system against bioaerosols [20] and antimicrobial activities of silver and copper nanoparticles against test bacteria [21] . In this study, we introduce for the first time, a susceptibility constant of airborne bacteria to DBD as a quantitative parameter for the performance evaluation of a DBD reactor.",

Fig. 5 shows the results for various applied voltages. The NO 2 and O 3 concentrations were 60.6-74.7 and 25.8-38.1 ppm, respectively. Higher applied voltages led to higher concentrations of NO 2 and O 3 because it became statistically more likely that N 2 and O 2 would be attacked by electrons. According to Pek\u00e1rek [34] , the initial steps in the formation of NO 2 and O 3 are the dissociation of N 2 and O 2 by electrons. The number of generated electrons is proportional to the applied current, which is also proportional to the applied voltage. Therefore, NO 2 and O 3 concentrations are proportional to the applied voltage. In this study, NO was observed using a spectrometer, however it was not detected by the gas analyzer (the detection limit for NO concentration is about 1 ppm). The spectrometer detects light emitted by NO molecules during their transition from an excited state to a lower energy state, while the final products of molecules from chemical kinetics are measured downstream by the gas analyzer. Hackam and Akiyama [35] , Ruan et al. [36] , and Wang et al. [37] presented that NO produced by plasma can be removed via the following reactions: where M is a third body, which can be N 2 or O 2 . Therefore, from our results obtained using the spectrometer and the gas analyzer, we expect that NO produced by plasma was changed to NO 2 or N 2 before entering the gas analyzer.

To calculate Eq. (6), we assumed that the mobilities ( ion ) were 1.1 and 1.9 cm 2 /V s for positive and negative air ions, respectively [38] . We inserted the maximum absolute current values (I max ) as I in Eq. (6) for obtaining the maximum air ion concentrations. The maximum concentrations of positive and negative air ions for 7.5 kV were 4.09 \u00d7 10 11 and 2.08 \u00d7 10 11 ions/cm 3 , respectively. The reason that the concentration of positive air ions was higher than that of negative air ions is the higher mobility of positive air ions. Our results were similar to those of Byeon et al. [39] . When the units of concentration were converted to ppm, the range of the maximum air ion concentration was 0.0083-0.0164 ppm, which was approximately 1/3100-1/2300 the value of the ozone concentration (25.8-38.1 ppm). However, according to Vaze et al. [15] , the bacterial inactivation efficiency is not high if only ozone exists without other reactive species. They reported that the reduction of E. coli bioaerosols exposed to DBD was 97% for 10 s of exposure time, but the reduction of E. coli bioaerosols exposed to ozone (concentration: 28 ppm; exposure time: 10 s) was only 10%. After characterization of our plasma reactor, one-pass removal tests of bioaerosols were then carried out for various residence times and applied voltages. Applying high air flow rates, three different residence times of 0.12, 0.16, and 0.24 s, were selected. These plasma treatments were much shorter than 1 s, as in Liang et al. [13] and Gallagher et al. [14] .",

These efficiencies increased as the applied voltage or residence time increased. Because the amplitude of oscillation of bioaerosols in a DBD reactor and the particle charging increased as the applied voltage increased, a higher applied voltage led to higher collection efficiencies. With a particle mobility, b p , electric field strength, E, and excitation frequency, \u03c9, the maximum particle displacement, l max , is (2b p E)/\u03c9 [40] and the electric field strength, E, is proportional to the applied voltage. Longer residence times and higher applied voltages increased the chance of bioaerosols being attacked by ions, ozone, or atomic oxygen, which resulted in higher inactivation efficiencies. Efficiencies \u00c1 CFU , \u00c1 Number , and \u00c1 Inactivation of up to 94%, 64%, and 83%, respectively, were obtained for an applied voltage of 7.5 kV and a residence time of 0.24 s. Liang et al.

Fig. 8 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of S. epidermidis precipitated on the DBD plate with and without plasma treatment. It is apparent that S. epidermidis suffered severe membrane rupture during the plasma treatment. The performance of a DBD reactor can also be evaluated using specific input energy (SIE). SIE was calculated with the following relation [41] : While the UV susceptibility constant has been widely used to quantify the effect of UV light on microorganisms in the study of UV systems [42, 43] , in this study the SIE susceptibility constant is suggested as a quantitative parameter for the estimation of the ability to remove bioaerosols by collection and inactivation processes in the DBD reactor. The SIE susceptibility constants of collection and inactivation processes, Z Number and Z Inactivation , respectively, are defined by the following equations:",

If these efficiencies are converted to susceptibility constants suggested in this paper, the susceptibility constants become 0.0340 and 0.0341 L/J, respectively, for Liang et al. [13] and Gallagher et al. [14] , which are four-fold higher than the CFU-based susceptibility constant of our DBD reactor, 0.0078 L/J. Therefore, it should be noted that the susceptibility constants introduced so far cannot be directly used for comparing the performance of DBD reactors whose dimensions are different from each other. The removal efficiency increases as plasma treatment time increases, and plasma treatment time increases with the volume of the plasma reactor. For example, the volumes of the reactor used in Liang et al. [13] and Gallagher et al. [14] were 0.026 and 0.025 L, respectively, while our reactor volume was 0.008 L. Therefore, if the same flow rate were used, the removal efficiency using a larger DBD reactor will be higher than that of a smaller DBD reactor, resulting in a higher susceptibility constant for the bigger DBD reactor.
