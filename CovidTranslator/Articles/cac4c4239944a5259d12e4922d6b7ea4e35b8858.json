Pandemics like this, are not just a medical phenomenon; they tend to affect quality of life in an individual and as a whole, causing social dysfunction. Stigma, xenophobia, mass hysteria and panic are the common offshoots. As the global prevalence increases, people start hoarding medical supplies, isolate themselves physically, restrict social interaction and enter into a constant state of healthanxiety even over mild conditions that can mimic the illness, like common cold (Duan and Zhu, 2020) . People with mental illness are especially vulnerable to these effects, as are the health-care workers in hospitals and laboratories, the volunteers and social service personnel ",

Recent literature states that even though online and at-site psychological services have been initiated in China, the lack of sensitization and training in mental health often adversely affect the performance and health outcome of the medical staff there (Chen et al, 2020). In this context, psychiatrists can play pivotal role in supporting the well-being of those affected and their families, the at-risk healthcare staff as well as the public. They are in fact in an unique position to offer a balanced perspective to improve the knowledge, attitude and practices about the illness as well as addressing the generalized anxiety and apprehension. Similar roles have been shown to improve the overall health-care service utilization and efficacy in similar earlier outbreaks like SARS (Wu et al, 2009). Here are few areas of possible intervention by the psychiatrists: Educating about the Common adverse psychological consequences Infections can create a range of behavioural and psychological effects. Patients can be informed about common stress responses like insomnia, panic attacks, health-anxiety, fear of illness or increase in substance use. Children and adolescents might show varied emotional responses like irritability, isolation or aggression which can be misinterpreted as 'regressive' behaviours. It is important to inform the public about general measures of countering stress J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f like sleep hygiene, activity scheduling, exercising, social connections, avoiding social media forwards and relaxation techniques. Also, they need to be made aware about the sources and sites of help available.",
