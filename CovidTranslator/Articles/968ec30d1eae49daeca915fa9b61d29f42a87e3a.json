In cats, mycobacteriosis caused by NTM is considered mostly to be a focal or dermal infection, with disseminated disease mostly caused by Mycobacterium avium. We describe three cases of disseminated mycobacteriosis in cats, caused by Mycobacterium malmoense, Mycobacterium branderi/shimoidei and M. avium, with no identified underlying immunosuppression. In all cases, extracellular mycobacteria were seen in the pulmonary epithelium, intestinal lumen and glomerular tufts, which could affect the shedding of the organism. The present study highlights the importance of mycobacteriosis as a differential even in immunocompetent animals. Considering the close relationship of owners and pets and the potential presence of free mycobacteria in secretions, cats should be considered as a possible environmental reservoir for mycobacteria.",

In the UK, a recent publication studying histopathological samples reported typical lesions with acid-fast bacteria in approximately 0.3% of all cases examined, with the most common mycobacteria isolated being M. bovis and M. microti (Gunn-Moore et al., 2013). Broughan et al. (2013) reported M. bovis-positive cultures in 16% of feline samples over a period of 7 years when examining microbiological samples submitted to the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency, UK, for confirmation of suspected mycobacteriosis. Cats with access to wildlife reservoirs or bovine milk infected with mycobacteria are predisposed to mycobacterial infections (Gunn-Moore, 2014; Pesciaroli et al., 2014) and there might be an increased risk associated with immunosuppressive diseases, especially with NTM infections (Gunn-Moore, 2014).",

NTM infections cause mostly cutaneous or subcutaneous nodules or granulomatous panniculitis with variable lymph node involvement (Gunn-Moore et al., 2011a; Gunn-Moore, 2014). The 'feline leprosy syndrome', a leprosy-like ulcerative and nodular skin disease especially affecting the head and limbs (Gunn-Moore, 2014), is also part of the NTM group of infections. Of the NTM species, a few cases of disseminated or systemic disease have been reported with M. avium (Morfitt et al., 1989; Barry et al., 2002; Griffin et al., 2003; Knippel et al., 2004; Baral et al., 2006; De Groot et al., 2010; Rivi ere et al., 2011) , two cases with Mycobacterium xenopi (MacWilliams et al., 1998; Meeks et al., 2008) and single cases with Mycobacterium heckeshornense (Elze et al., 2013) , Mycobacterium simiae (Dietrich et al., 2003) and Mycobacterium kansasii (Lee et al., 2017) .

Of the systemic NTM infections described, only M. avium and M. simiae have been described in cats with no apparent immunocompromise (Morfitt et al., 1989; Barry et al., 2002; Dietrich et al., 2003; Knippel et al., 2004; Baral et al., 2006; De Groot et al., 2010; Rivi ere et al., 2011 ). An idiopathic CD4 + (cluster of differentiation) T-cell lymphopenia was suspected to be the cause of a M. xenopi infection (Meeks et al., 2008) and local surgery may have caused fulmination of another M. xenopi infection (MacWilliams et al., 1998) . FIV infection was described with M. heckeshornense infection (Elze et al., 2013) . No apparent immu-nocompromising factors were noted in the history or macroscopical or histological findings in the present cases.

Lymph nodes and spleen were affected in all cases, while only cats A and C had gross changes in the liver and lungs. The presence of necrosis also varied between the cases. M. malmoense is phylogenetically closer to M. avium than to M. branderi/shimodei (Schrenzel, 2012) , which could in part account for the different gross findings. However, no morphological differences are reported between different mycobacterial infections (Gunn-Moore et al., 2011a) and more cases are needed to determine whether there are differences between the infections caused by different mycobacterial species. In previous studies (Morfitt et al., 1989; Knippel et al., 2004; Baral et al., 2006; De Groot et al., 2010; Gunn-Moore et al., 2011a) , lymph node involvement was common, as it was in the present study. Sampling an enlarged lymph node can be a fast and relatively easy way to confirm a diagnosis. M. avium has been described to cause enlarged abdominal lymph nodes (Barry et al., 2002; Knippel et al., 2004; Rivi ere et al., 2011) , similar to cats B and C in this study and in addition to feline infectious peritonitis and lymphoma, mycobacteriosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis when markedly enlarged abdominal lymph nodes are noted. There were clear histological differences between the cases. The lesions of cat C resembled classical tuberculous granulomas, while cats A and B had more diffuse infiltration with no apparent granuloma formation. There also appeared to be an affinity for vascular structures in cats A and B, which was absent from the lesions in cat C. Histological patterns similar to those reported in cat C are described with M. avium infection (Morfitt et al., 1989; Knippel et al., 2004; Baral et al., 2006) . To the best of our knowledge, there are no detailed descriptions in the literature concerning the histological pattern for M. branderi/ shimoidei or M. malmoense infection, but Gunn-Moore et al. (2011b) found no significant differences between the histological changes related to infections by different mycobacteria. However, most of those cases involved infection with MTC species, MAC species or were culture-negative, with only one cat with M. malmoense infection studied. When considering giant cells, the present findings match the results of Gunn-Moore et al. (2011b), with giant cells appearing with M. malmoense infection, but being rare in lesions caused by M. avium. In cat C, mycobacteria-laden macrophages were also often seen within the adipose tissue of different organs, which could indicate similar predilection for adipose tissue as reported for some NTM species (Gunn-Moore, 2014).",

Based on these results, mycobacterial spreading between organ systems may happen faster than the formation of visible lesions. This should be taken into account when considering surgical excision of lesions.",

Even though people and animals are readily exposed to the bacteria in the environment (Griffith et al., 2007) , infections caused by NTM are rare and, to our knowledge, there are no reported animal-to-human infections of NTM species outside the MAC. However, considering the close relationship of owners and pets and the survivability of mycobacteria in the household environment, a cat shedding mycobacteria in its faeces and sputum may increase the owner's exposure to mycobacteria. This should be taken into consideration, especially if the animal is infected with MAC species or if the owner has any immunocompromise.",
