Its amino acid sequence shares similarity with those of TARC/ CCL17 and MDC/CCL22, the cognate ligands for CCR4. The chemotactic effects of CKLF1 for CCR4-transfected cells could be desensitized by TARC/CCL17 and markedly inhibited by PTX. CKLF1 induced a calcium flux in CCR4-transfected cells and fully desensitized a subsequent response to TARC/CCL17, and TARC/CCL17 could partly desensitize the response to CKLF1. CKLF1 caused significant receptor internalization in pCCR4-EGFP transfected cells. Taken together, CKLF1 is a novel functional ligand for CCR4. D",

            "text": "Chemokines comprise a large family of structurally homologous small cytokines. The complexity and functions of the chemokine family have become increasingly diverse as new members have been identified and characterized. The classification of chemokines is based on the distance between the first two of four to six conserved cysteine residues. Four subfamilies of chemokines have been discovered to date: CXC(a), CC(h), C(g), and CX3C (Baggiolini and Dahinden, 1994; Kelner, et al., 1994; Bazan, et al., 1997) . All chemokines mediate their activities through G-protein coupled receptors, have a characteristic seven-transmembrane structure, bind specific ligands with high affinity and transduce signals to the inside of the cell through heterotrimeric G-proteins (Rollins, 1997) that are grouped into two families depending on the sensitivity to pertussis toxin (PTX). Gi/o family G proteins are sensitive to PTX whereas Gq family G proteins are known to be insensitive to this toxin (Wu, et al., 1993; Venkatakrishnan, et al., 2000) .",

The open reading frame of CKLF1 cDNA encodes a highly basic and hydrophobic polypeptide of a total of 99 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 10.9 kD. CKLF1, secreted by cells transfected with CKLF1 expression plasmid, displays chemotactic activities in a wide spectrum of leukocytes and CKLF1 also shows a capability for stimulating the proliferation of murine skeletal muscle cells (Han, et al., 2001) and the proliferation of human bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells and colony formation (Ke, et al., 2002) . CKLF1 has a CC motif and the key amino acids around the motif are identical with those of TARC/CCL17 (Thymus-and activation-regulated chemokine) and MDC/CCL22 (Macrophage Derived Chemokine), though lacking the additional C-terminus cysteines as compared to other CC subfamily members (Han, et al., 2001) . According to pair-wise sequence comparisons of conserved regions using Needle software (HGMP, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK) (Han, et al., 2003) , the sequence identities and similarities between the local conserved sequences around the CC motif of CKLF1 and TARC/CCL17 (67 amino acids were compared) or MDC/CCL22 (87 amino acids were compared) are 28.4%(19/ 67) and 41.8%(28/67), or 25.3%(22/87) and 46%(40/87), respectively. The gene encoding CKLF is located on chromosome 16q22, and the TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22 are the only two CC chemokine genes located on chromosome 16. TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22 have been found to be highly specific ligands for CCR4 (Imai et al., 1997 (Imai et al., , 1998 . Because of the similarities between CKLF1 and TARC/CCL17 and MDC/ CCL22, this study was undertaken to determine if CKLF1 interacts with CCR4, the receptor for TARC/CCL17 and MDC/ CCL22. The results confirm that CKLF1 is a novel functional ligand for CCR4.",

Briefly, the CKLF1 cDNA containing the entire coding region was excised with EcoRI + XhoI and subcloned into the EcoRI + XhoI site of the pMT/V5-Myc-His A vector downstream of the metallothionein promoter. The resulting recombinant plasmid, pMT/V5-CKLF1-Myc-His, was cotransfected with the hygromycin B resistance vector pCoHygro into Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells using a Calcium Phosphate Transfection Kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.) and stable clones were selected with 300 Ag/ml hygromycin B in Schneider's Drosophila Medium plus 10% FBS. Transfected S2 cells grew in serum-free DES expression medium and were induced to produce recombinant CKLF1 with CuSO 4 . The cell supernatant was dialyzed in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and loaded onto a Ni-NTA (Qiagen) chelating sepharose fast flow column (equilibrated in dialysis buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole (pH 8.0) and 5 mM hmercaptoethanol). The column was then washed in PBS containing 10 mM imidazole (pH 8.0) and 10% glycerol. CKLF1 eluted in 50 -500 mM imidazole. The sample was then dialyzed and was again loaded onto a Ni-NTA (Qiagen) chelating sepharose fast flow column and the CKLF1-Myc-His purified further.

However, there is another group of proteins unrelated structurally to chemokines but having chemokine-like functions, basically an ability to recruit and activate leukocytes, such as urokinase, macrophage migration inhibitory factor and interleukin-6, anaphylatoxin C5a, ribosomal protein S19, nuclear protein HMGB1, and thioredoxin (Trx). These chemokine-like factors, classified into CLF (chemokine-like functions) class (Degryse and Virgilio, 2003) , are multifunctional proteins that exert various well-defined primary roles, while under special circumstances can exhibit the chemokine-like functions as secondary roles. Like chemokines, elevated levels of Trx have been shown to inhibit neutrophil and monocyte recruitment induced by the murine chemokines KC/GROalpha, RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), and MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) (Nakamura et al., 2001) . However, the mechanism of desensitization is unclear because Trx does not act through a 7TM-R and/or G proteins. In addition, like chemokines, uPA/ uPAR-dependent signaling (Degryse et al., 1999 (Degryse et al., , 2001b Degryse, 2003) and the chemotaxis of HMGB1 (Degryse et al., 2001a) are PTX sensitive, suggesting the involvement of a heterotrimeric G-protein, but the complete mechanism of which are not known.",

Therefore, CKLF1 shares structural and multifunctional prop-erties with the CLF proteins mentioned above. On the other hand, CKLF1 is distinguished from these CLF proteins due to the similarity with TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22, two members of the CC chemokine family and CCR4 is their common functional receptor, and due to the identical CC motif and key amino acids around the motif between CKLF1 and TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22 (Han et al., 2001) , though CKLF1 lacks the additional C-terminus cysteines comparing with other CC subfamily members. In addition, CKLF1 can induce migration of lymphocytes and shows high-level expression in thymus (Han et al., 2001) , which is similar with TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22. We therefore speculate that CKLF1 is a chemokine-like factor between classical chemokines and chemokine-like proteins (unrelated structurally to classical chemokines), and CKLF1, TARC/CCL17 and MDC/ CCL22 may have overlapping receptor specificity and therefore compared the receptor activation by TARC/CCL17.",

            "text": "In this work, the potential interaction of CKLF1 with the chemokine receptors was investigated. CKLF1 is a potent agonist for CCR4, as demonstrated by calcium mobilization, chemotaxis and internalization experiments. CKLF1 was able to induce transmigration of HEK293 cells expressing CCR4, but not CCR6 or mock-transfected cells, while pretreatment with TARC/CCL17 can desensitize the receptor to subsequent stimulation with CKLF1 (Fig. 2) . The CKLF1 dose -response curve for chemotaxis was bell-shaped, which is typical for responses to chemokines. It is known that CCR4 couples to the Gi/o family proteins (Oh et al., 2002; New and Wong, 2003) , which is sensitive to PTX. Furthermore, these actions of CKLF1 were markedly inhibited by treatment of the cells with PTX. We were also able to show that CKLF1 or TARC/CCL17 is capable of specifically inducing transient calcium mobilization in CCR4-expressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 3) . CKLF1 completely desensitized these cells to TARC/CCL17 and TARC/CCL17 partially desensitized CCR4-expressing HEK293 cells to CKLF1 (Fig. 3) , suggesting the possibility that there is a higher affinity of CKLF1 compared to TARC/ CCL17 for CCR4. CKLF1 specifically induced internalization of CCR4-EGFP (Fig. 4) . Taken together, out data indicate that CKLF1 is a functional ligand for CCR4. Fig. 4 .

The sustained morphological abnormalities of the bronchial and bronchiolar wall, induced by CKLF1, mimicked those in chronic persistent asthma. Acute pneumonitis and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis induced by CKLF1 is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as well as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), suggesting that CKLF1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. A series of studies have showed the involvement of CCR4 in allergic lung inflammation (Gonzalo et al., 1999; Lloyd et al., 2001; Panina-Bordignon et al., 2001) . Therefore, we speculate that CKLF 1 selectively recruits CCR4 expressing cells, such as T-helper type 2 cells, as an important mechanism in allergic inflammation, which may constitute a new drug target for the development of antagonists, humanized monoclonal anti-CKLF1 antibody being an attractive candidate.",

Besides high expression in thymus, CKLF1 has extensive tissue distributions, which is different from TARC/ CCL17 and MDC/CCL22 abundantly expressed in the thymus with very little expression in other tissues (Power et al., 1995; Imai et al., 1996; Godiska et al., 1997; Imai et al., 1998) . By contrast, CKLF1 also has high expression levels in human spleen, lung, testis, ovary, peripheral blood leucocytes, placenta, pancreas, fetal brain, fetal skeletal muscle, fetal thymus and fetal heart (Han et al., 2001) . CKLF1 may possess other relevant biological functions. Previous results have demonstrated that CKLF1 is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes (Han et al., 2001) and can increase the proliferation of human bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells and colony formation (Ke, et al., 2002) , it also has promoting effects on the proliferation and differentiation of skeletal muscle cells (Han et al., 2001) . It is possible that CKLF1, TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22 may play both similar as well as distinct physiological and pathological roles. CCR4 is selectively expressed on dendritic cells, basophils, T cells (Th2, Treg, skin-homing), and platelets (D'Ambrosio et al., 2003) , suggesting CKLF1 may also act on other receptors different from CCR4. To date, about 50 chemokines and 20 receptors have been identified which suggests that a number of chemokines must bind to the same receptor and that one chemokine can bind several receptors (Bajetto et al., 2002) . We also found that a chemically synthesized peptide, corresponding to the sequence of CKLF1, can interact with other receptors besides CCR4 (data not shown).",

Thus, CKLF1 may also play a role in the humoral immune response and germinal center formation via CCR4 or other chemokine receptors.",

Further studies may be usefully directed to determining whether CKLF1 has affinity for other receptors and the respective functioning. Overall this study should aid in our understanding of inflammatory diseases and development of tissue cells.",
