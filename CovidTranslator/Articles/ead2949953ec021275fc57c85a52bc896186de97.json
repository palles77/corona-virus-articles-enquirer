            "text": "It is understandable that a sense of complacency about infectious disease took hold of medicine and public health in the late twentieth century. Improvements in sanitation, nutrition, housing, and occupational health dramatically decreased infectious disease rates in the United States. Immunizations were effective against viral infections: smallpox was eradicated world-wide; rubella was eliminated from North America; and rates of other childhood viral diseases markedly reduced. 1, 2 With the development of safe and effective vaccines and drugs to treat bacterial infections, bacteria appeared defeated. All these factors caused an inappropriate confi dence that infectious diseases would be completely eradicated as a public health problem. In fact, in 1967, US Surgeon General William H. Stewart announced that it was 'time to close the book on infectious diseases, declare the war against pestilence won, and shift national resources to such chronic problems as cancer and heart disease.' 3 Despite this hubris, others began to sound the alarm. The term 'emerging dis-eases' was fi rst used by David J. Sencer in 1971. 4 In 1976, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) investigated an outbreak of disease affecting attendees at the National American Legion Convention in Philadelphia, and the following year CDC isolated the causative agent, Legionella pneumophila, for what is now called Legionnaire's disease. In 1981, Richard M. Krause, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, published an early clarion call with his book The Restless Tide: The Persistent Challenge of the Microbial World. 5 Shortly thereafter, the epidemic of AIDS was recognized and over the next 10 years a growing sense of unease arose as new infectious disease outbreaks were identifi ed.",

Disease occurs when a pathogen meets a host that is vulnerable to the agent in an environment that allows the agent and host to interact. Agent, host, and environment alone are not suffi cient to cause an epidemic, however. For a pathogen to be successful in causing an epidemic, an unbroken chain of transmission must be present. Given a suitable mode of spread and a chain of transmission from one susceptible host to another, an outbreak can develop. The chain of transmission may be thought of categorically as a source for the agent, the presence of the agent (pathogen), a portal of exit from the source, a mode of transmission, a portal of entry into the host, and a susceptible host.",

Vector-borne diseases are transmitted indirectly by a live carrier, usually an arthropod, such as mosquitoes, fl eas, or ticks. The transmission may be mechanical, in which the vector acts to transport the pathogen, but is not biologically necessary for replication, such as fecal coliform bacteria transported by a housefl y, or biological transmission in which the vector is a site of replication of the pathogen, such as malarial parasites in mosquito species.",

Populations are frequently heterogeneous, however, with people interacting through networks of relationships. Disease transmission is facilitated between members of such networks more effi ciently than outside these networks. Studies of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) highlight the important role of networks in disease transmission, but networks are equally important in diseases transmitted by other routes besides sexual transmission. Tuberculosis, for example, is much easier spread to family members because it requires prolonged, close contact. Addi-tionally, the model does not take into account stochastic events which may have profound effects on the course of an epidemic. One infectious patient traveling on an intercontinental fl ight to an immunologically na\u00efve population may have a profound impact on spread of a respiratory disease. Finally, the model fails to recognize the importance of host factors that lend to epidemic potential.

Infectious diseases favor the poor and disenfranchised. It should not be surprising that emerging infectious diseases would be associated with social inequality. 12 Refugees frequently have fl ed their country of origin with little in the way of fi nancial resources. If they were in a refugee camp prior to immigration they endured privations including crowding, malnutrition, poor sanitation, inadequate clothing, and poor access to basic health services. For example, patients may acquire tuberculosis that recrudesces later or is diagnosed after arrival in their new home country. 13 Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) is of particular concern because it is diffi cult to diagnose and treat.

This is true because under CDC protocols some refugees receive both overseas preventive therapy (antimalarials) as well as post-arrival medical screening. Some legal immigrants must also receive overseas preventive care and basic medical screening.

Domesticated ducks, in particular, are known to excrete high titers of infl uenza from their GI tracts, with infl uenza deposited into local ponds remaining active for weeks. 18 Next, individuals infected by both avian and human strains provide the opportunity for an antigenic shift to occur, whereby the virulent avian strain can gain characteristics that allow it to propagate human to human. Of note, both the 1957 H2N2 and the 1968 H3N2 pandemic strains were thought to develop along similar two-step pathways, while the 1918 H1N1 strain has more recently been shown to be a product of antigenic drift alone. 19 Of more concern to contemporary policy makers, the highly lethal H5N1 avian virus has been shown to need only minimal modifi cation by either route to gain a foothold among humans. 20 Recognition, treatment, and containment of pandemic infl uenza remain problematic. Infl uenza's primary mode of transmission, via aerosolization of respiratory secretions, allows for the rapid inoculation of multiple hosts, particularly during the initial asymptomatic 2-4-day incubation period. 16 Of the 10-20% of the US population who are infected annually, primary symptoms remain non-specifi c, typically comprising fever, myalgias, cough, and headache. 21, 22 Symptoms of previously documented pandemic strains begin similarly, though may rapidly convert to a multilobar, hemorrhagic pneumonitis followed quickly by bacterial superinfection and/or death. 14, 23 Strategies for containment at this time rely on respiratory isolation of infected individuals, and on the rapid development of new infl uenza vaccines to cover emerging strains. Treatment typically consists of the early administration of antiviral medications, notably oseltamivir and zanamivir, which have limited effi cacy, and supportive care. 24 ",

            "text": "Over 2 billion people internationally are currently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis which also infects 8-10 million more per year, and has an asso ciated annual mortality of nearly 2 million in dividuals. Despite global eradication efforts, the re-emergence and spread of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB), continues to threaten global eradication goals, and has again made the disease a public health threat. MDRTB is defi ned as a strain of tuberculosis that has developed resistance to both isoniazid and, most importantly, rifampin, the most powerful bactericidal antituberculosis medications presently available. MDRTB strains originate from sites of poor tuberculosis-control infrastructure, where inadequate drug supplies, inconsistent treatment regimens, multistrain infections, and compliance failures lead to a vicious cycle of resistance build-up and reinfection. 25 Infectivity does not differ from nonresistant strains, with cough and aerosolization being the primary mode of transmission. Because of resistance, treatment of MDRTB requires the use of less potent and less tolerable second-line agents. In order to assure cure, treatment duration must be extended, typically to 18-24 months. Consequently, treatment failures are more common compared with non-MDRTB cases. Mortality rates for MDRTB presently range from 12% for persons not infected by the human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV) to 90% for HIV-positive individuals. 26 Control of MDRTB abroad and within the US requires a strong global eradication effort and the geographically sensitive screening of new immigrants. 27 Global efforts led by the World Health Organization's (WHO) Stop TB Partnership via the institution of directly observed therapy (DOT) programs among member countries has increased the number of individuals treated and slowed the annual incidence among most countries surveyed. 28 Despite this progress, however, MDRTB continues to comprise 2-4% of new infections, and has resulted in multiple serious urban outbreaks throughout the United States. [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] Though foreign-born individuals comprise only 10% of the US population, they also account for greater than 50% of tuberculosis cases, and consequently play an important role in spread of MDRTB. 27 Suspicion of drug-resistant TB can largely be based on origin of the immigrant. Though MDRTB has been identifi ed in nearly every country surveyed, additional attention should be paid to immigrants from global 'hot spots' where the prevalence of MDRTB exceeds 5%, and include the countries of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Israel, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Ecuador, the Russian oblast Tomsk, and the Lianoning and Henan provinces of China. 35 Recently, an outbreak of MDRTB in Hmong refugees who were in the process of settling in the US from Thailand served as a reminder of the cost and threat of this infection and has led to enhanced refugee screening overseas.",

In some countries with high rates of HIV, limited healthcare resources, social stigmatization, lack of safe alternative nutrition sources, and poor infrastructure hinder prevention efforts aimed at reducing perinatal HIV transmission. Although perinatal HIV infection in the US has become rare because of available interventions, it is worth noting that because of many disparities in healthcare, including lack of knowledge of the importance of prenatal care, immigrant women are much more likely to present for delivery with unknown or positive HIV status, placing the infant at greater risk. Also, some immigrants and refugees are coming from areas of the world where HIV is highly endemic. At the time of migration, existing children in the family may be infected. With the reduction in mother-to-child transmission in the US, the pediatric HIV-infected cohort is rapidly aging.

The pathogens that are the threat of the future may be ones that were previously thought contained or even eradicated. They may be diseases long ignored because they no longer affl ict those living in comfort in the developed world despite continuing to exact their toll among the disenfranchised. Or they may be newly identifi ed as they emerge from the crevices of an ever-shrinking world. The challenge to healthcare providers and public health workers is to continue to advocate for basic healthcare for all and to be ever vigilant to the smoldering outbreak poised to become the next headline emerging disease.",
