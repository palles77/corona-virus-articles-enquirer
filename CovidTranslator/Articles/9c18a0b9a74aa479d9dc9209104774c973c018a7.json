Like crystalloid and colloid solutions, blood products are not used to treat disease; they are supportive therapies given to correct deficiencies in the patient until the underlying disease process can be treated. For example, a red blood cell transfusion is given to replace red blood cells lost as a result of a traumatic laceration. The transfusion of red blood cells increases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, allowing for surgical repair of the laceration; it is not the primary treatment for hemorrhage. Likewise, sodium chloride is used to replace sodium, chloride, and water in a dehydrated patient with hypoadrenocorticism until adrenal hormones can be replaced.",

Volume overload, electrolyte disturbances, and transmission of infection can occur from administration of pathogen-contaminated blood products or fluids. 18, 46, 91 Despite the potential negative effects of transfusion, most veterinarians view it as lifesaving therapy allowing the transfusion recipient to receive other necessary treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, or medical care. 38 Three major differences exist between the more commonly used fluids and blood products. The differences between crystalloid or colloid solutions and blood products are their immunogenicity, availability, and cost. The immunogenicity of blood products stems from the proteins and cellular material in the blood. Because crystalloid solutions lack proteins and cellular material, they are not considered immunogenic; however, certain colloid solutions such as hydroxyethyl starch have been reported to cause acute anaphylaxis in rare instances in humans. 70 The mechanism of this reaction is unknown.",

            "text": "Despite the fact that the first documented transfusion was given to a dog in 1665 by Richard Lower at Oxford University, veterinary transfusion medicine scientifically and technologically lags behind its counterpart in human medicine. 54 Information in this chapter is based on animal studies whenever possible. When none is available, currently accepted guidelines from human medicine will be applied to the veterinary patient. The purpose of this chapter is to provide the reader with the following: it is collected from the donor, but it is neither a specific therapy nor economical use of blood. The optimal method of preservation of blood for transfusion is to separate whole blood into its component parts. Appropriate use of blood components not only conserves the products but also allows the most specific and safe product to be used for each animal. When blood components are used instead of whole blood for transfusion, two dogs can benefit from 1 unit of whole blood. A plasma transfusion counteracts the anticoagulant effects of rodenticide intoxication in one dog, and red blood cells from the same donor can provide enhanced oxygen-carrying capacity in a second, anemic dog. Component transfusions also have been used in cats, but preparation of components is more difficult because of the small volume of blood collected from donor cats. 35, 48, 72 Veterinarians need to become familiar with the use of blood components because blood components are the predominant products available through commercial blood banks. Component therapy requires planning to maintain an adequate blood inventory either through ordering blood from a blood bank or through acquiring and coordinating the equipment and donors for successful blood collection. Preparation of blood components from whole blood requires that the blood from the donor be collected into the anticoagulant-containing bag of a multibag plastic blood collection system. The whole blood then is separated into packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and plasma by differential centrifugation, and the plasma is transferred into one or more of the satellite bags via the sterile tubing linking the bags. The bags are separated, and PRBCs are stored in a refrigerator while plasma is frozen. Blood collected into glass bottles is not amenable to centrifugation and cannot be processed into components. Additionally, storage of canine blood in a glass bottle results in lower levels of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) than blood stored in plastic bags; consequently, plastic bags are the preferred storage container for blood. 16 Most general practitioners do not have access to the type of centrifuge required to properly separate blood into components. It is possible to acquire a used centrifuge or request the local blood bank to process the blood collected by the veterinarian. However, production of components is not feasible for most veterinarians, and the technical aspects of component production are not included in this chapter but can be found elsewhere. 60, 72 The most commonly used blood products, their indications, and suggested dosages are described below. The dosage of a blood product depends on the physical state of the patient and the response of the patient to the treatment: in essence, the treatment is \"to effect.\"",

As a starting point, the dosage for whole blood is 10 to 22 mL/kg. cell volume (PCV) after transfusion of 1 unit of PRBCs has been shown to be equivalent to the increase after transfusion of 1 unit of whole blood. 48 PRBCs are used only to treat clinically symptomatic anemia because they do not contain platelets or clotting factors. Red blood cell transfusions are administered to cats for a variety of reasons. Data on 126 cats administered whole blood or PRBCs indicated 52% were transfused for blood loss anemia, 38% for erythropoietic failure, and 10% for hemolytic anemia. 48 Similar reasons for transfusion of cats have been reported in Germany. 90 Dogs more commonly are transfused for blood loss anemia (70%) with 14% to 22% being transfused for hemolytic anemia and 8% to 14% for erythropoietic failure. 8, 45 The initial dosage of PRBCs is 6 to 10 mL/kg, and transfusion is continued until the clinical signs of anemia are improved.",

When whole blood is centrifuged to produce plasma and PRBCs, the anticoagulant is collected in the plasma fraction. Fresh frozen plasma contains all clotting factors, which, if frozen at \u221230\u00b0C in a blood bank freezer, maintain activity for 12 months. 85 Fresh frozen plasma maintained in an upright freezer at \u221220\u00b0C maintains clotting factor activity for 6 months. When frozen, the plastic storage bag becomes brittle and if not carefully handled can crack, rendering the plasma unusable. For this reason, plasma is stored in special boxes to protect the plastic bag and must be handled carefully before transfusion. Fresh frozen plasma has been used to treat a wide variety of clinical patients. A retrospective analysis of fresh frozen plasma usage in dogs identified multiple indications for administration of fresh frozen plasma, including replacement of coagulation factors, albumin, \u03b12-macroglobulin, and immunoglobulin despite the recommendation that fresh frozen plasma should not be used as a source of albumin, for volume expansion, or nutritional support. 53, 62 Calculations suggest that 45 mL/kg of plasma would need to be given to increase albumin serum concentration by 1 g/dL. 84 In cases of coagulation factor deficiencies, plasma should be given to effect (i.e., until active bleeding ceases). 50 For the treatment of coagulation disorders, 6 to 10 mL/kg is the recommended starting dosage. Multiple doses may be required to control bleeding because of the short halflife of clotting factors, especially in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation. Normalization of previously abnormal coagulation tests can be used as a guide for discontinuation of plasma therapy.",

In a laboratory setting, antibodies against DEA 1.2 have been reported to cause transfusion reactions, but clinical reports of hemolytic transfusion reactions mediated by anti-DEA 1.2 antibodies are lacking.

The most common reason for an acute hemolytic transfusion 574 SPECIAL THERAPY reaction in human patients is clerical error-the wrong unit of blood is released from the blood bank or a unit of blood is given to a patient who was not intended to receive a transfusion. 80 In veterinary medicine, it is crucial to confirm that the blood comes from the correct species of blood donor in addition to being typed and matched to the patient requiring a transfusion. The contents of the bag also should be examined for normal color and consistency. Bacterially contaminated blood often appears brown or purple because of deoxygenation, hemolysis, and formation of methemoglobin. 37 Blood and plasma can be administered using several routes. Most commonly, blood is given intravenously. The diameter of the catheter used for transfusion is important in determining the rate of blood flow because blood flows more slowly through a small catheter; however, small diameter catheters have not been associated with increased risk of hemolysis during transfusion. 83 The intraosseous route can be used successfully for administration of blood and plasma. 63 In normal dogs, 93% to 98% of red blood cells administered through an intraosseous catheter are found in the peripheral circulation within 5 minutes. 13 This rapid and simple method is especially useful in animals with vascular collapse and in extremely young puppies and kittens. Special intraosseous catheters are available, but a spinal needle, bone marrow aspiration needle, over-the-needle catheter, or even an ordinary hypodermic needle can be used. Sites for the placement of the intraosseous catheter include the trochanteric fossa of the femur, the medial tibia, and the iliac crest. Blood flows very rapidly through an intraosseous catheter, and rate of administration should be monitored closely. Plasma can be administered intraperitoneally in emergency situations, but red blood cells are slowly and poorly absorbed by this route, and it is not recommended for red blood cell transfusions.",

In all animals suspected of having some form of acute transfusion reaction, the transfusion should be stopped and samples of patient blood and urine obtained for baseline evaluation of biochemical, hematologic, and coagulation values. The unit of blood should be inspected to ensure it is from the appropriate species and is the intended unit based on the crossmatch or blood type. Urine can be visually inspected to determine the presence or absence of hemoglobin. A Gram stain and bacterial culture of the blood remaining in the blood bag should be done. Rectal temperature of the recipient should be compared with the pretransfusion value. A transfusionassociated fever is defined as an increase in 1\u00b0F over the pretransfusion temperature. 83 The cardiovascular system should be monitored by electrocardiogram and blood pressure measurement. Immediate evaluation of serum ionized calcium and potassium concentrations would be useful, but certain electrocardiographic changes suggest hypocalcemia (long QT interval with a normal heart rate) or hyperkalemia (decreased height of P waves, loss of P waves, or widening of the QRS complex with large T waves) if rapid measurement of serum electrolyte concentrations cannot be obtained. Venous access and blood pressure should be maintained by an infusion of a crystalloid solution such as lactated Ringer's solution or 0.9% NaCl. Intravenous administration of short-acting glucocorticoids may suppress some of the mediators of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions and lessen the clinical progression, but their efficacy in transfusion reactions has not been evaluated in veterinary patients. When the evaluation of a patient with a suspected transfusion reaction suggests that an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction is occurring, the blood typing and crossmatching must be repeated to determine whether a laboratory error is responsible for the reaction. When fever occurs without evidence of hemolysis and the Gram stain is negative for bacterial contamination, the transfusion may be restarted.",

The Food and Drug Administration has approved a hemoglobin-based oxygen-carrying (HBOC) fluid, Oxyglobin (Biopure Corporation, Cambridge, MA), for use in the dog. Oxyglobin (hemoglobin glutamer-200 [bovine]) is ultrapurified, polymerized hemoglobin of bovine origin (13 g/dL) in a modified Ringer's lactate solution with a physiologic pH (7.8). The hemoglobin polymers range in molecular mass from 65 to 500 kD, with an average of 200 kD. The viscosity is low compared with blood (1.3 and 3.5 centipoise, respectively), and the solution is isosmotic (300 mOsm/kg) with blood. The concentration of methemoglobin, the inactive form of hemoglobin, is 10%. Oxyglobin can be stored at room temperature or refrigerated (2 to 30\u00b0C) for up to 3 years. Its intravascular half-life is dose dependent (18 to 43 hours, at a dosage of 10 to 30 mL/kg), as measured in healthy dogs. It is expected that more than 90% of the administered dose will be eliminated from the body in 5 to 7 days after infusion. The oxygen half-saturation pressure (P-50) of Oxyglobin is greater than that of canine blood (38 versus 30 mm Hg, respectively). This increase in P-50 facilitates offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin. The hemoglobin is packaged in the deoxygenated state in an overwrap that is impermeable to oxygen.",

Dogs in both groups were monitored for a decrease in hemoglobin concentration or deterioration in physical condition at which time they received additional oxygen-carrying support. If additional oxygencarrying support was needed, Oxyglobin-treated dogs received PRBCs (n = 1), and untreated control dogs received Oxyglobin (n = 19). Treatment success was defined as the lack of need for additional oxygencarrying support for 24 hours. The success rate in treated dogs (95%) was significantly greater than the success rate in control dogs (32%). This difference between treated and control dogs was significant, regardless of the cause of anemia. Although Oxyglobin is not approved for use in cats, a retrospective study of its use in 72 cats recently has been published. 20 Oxyglobin was administered to these cats off-label and with owner consent. Anemia caused by blood loss, ineffective erythropoiesis, and hemolysis was the reason for Oxyglobin administration in all but two cats.

Blood from a type A cat is adequate.Screening blood donors for infectious diseases transmitted by blood transfusion is an integral step in maintaining a safe blood supply. Infectious disease screening of canine and feline blood donors varies within the different geographic regions of the United States and with the breed of the blood donor. A consensus statement developed by a committee consisting of members of the Infectious Disease Study Group and the Association of Veterinary Hematology and Transfusion Medicine should serve as the guideline for donor screening.88 Infectious organisms known to be transmitted by blood transfusion include B. canis, B. gibsoni, Haemobartonella canis, and Leishmania sp.18,51,64,76 All canine blood donors should be screened for Ehrlichia canis and Brucella canis, and if they test positive, they should be eliminated from the donor pool. Titers against E. canis less than 1:80 may be false positives and should be repeated in 2 to 3 weeks. Dogs with initially negative titers to E. canis can receive additional screening with a PCR test. Splenectomy of donor dogs to facilitate identification of B. canis and H. canis carriers is not recommended. In neutered dogs, a single negative test for Brucella canis is adequate. Based on travel history and breed, additional screening for Trypanosoma cruzi, Bartonella vinsonii, B. canis, B. gibsoni, L. donovani, and organisms previously classified as Ehrlichia spp. (Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Anaplasma platys) may be indicated.",

Cats that are infected with organisms formerly classified as Haemobartonella sp. (Mycoplasma haemofelis and Mycoplasma haemonominutum) also should be eliminated from the donor pool. Testing should include both light microscopy and PCR for Mycoplasma sp. Screening of donor cats for feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is problematic because there is no reliable test to identify the FIP-causing coronavirus. Feline blood donors should be screened for infection with Cytauxzoon felis and the agents causing feline ehrlichiosis if they are known to have traveled to endemic locations.",
