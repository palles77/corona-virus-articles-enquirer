Traditionally, they have been divided into two species (A&B) and over 100 serotypes. In 2006, a number of novel RV strains were identified with significant variation in the viral protein (VP) regions (VP2, VP4) and 5\u2032 non-coding region (5\u2032 NCR); these formed a distinct new species that was designated \"rhinovirus C\" (RV-C) (2, 5, 6) . Approximately 60 RV-C types are now recognized based on phylogenetic clustering, and these viruses have been associated with severe acute respiratory infection (ARI), particularly wheezing ARIs, in young children (7) (8) (9) and asthmatics (10) (11) (12) .",

Pneumonia was diagnosed in children with fever, tachypnoea and respiratory distress where focal or diffuse crackles or decreased vesicular sounds were present on auscultation. Most diagnoses of pneumonia were based on clinical criteria alone, but radiographic findings were used in some. A diagnosis of asthma/episodic viral wheeze (EVW) was made in children in whom discreet episodes of wheeze occurred, often in association with a presumed viral upper respiratory tract infection.
