First, the desire to please or satisfy patients is a powerful motivator, and clinicians frequently describe this as the chief reason for why they prescribe antibiotics for patients with viral ARIs 5 ; however, several studies have shown that patient satisfaction does not diminish when antibiotics are withheld. [6] [7] [8] Second, clinicians are often misinformed about the nature and course of ARIs or possess dated information about how to diagnose and manage them. 5 Thus, the purpose of this article is to review current evidencebased recommendations about the diagnosis and management of ARIs in adults.",

Although clinicians frequently prescribe antibiotics for rhinosinusitis, it is almost always viral in origin with less than 2% of the cases stemming from bacteria. Bacterial rhinosinusitis typically results from a secondary infection arising from sinus ostia obstruction and impaired mucous drainage 14 with the most common organisms being Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenza, anaerobes, and Staphylococcus aureus in decreasing order of prevalence. 15 Clinically, differentiating bacterial from viral rhinosinusitis is challenging.The reference standard for diagnosing bacterial rhinosinusitis is sinus puncture with culture, an invasive procedure rarely performed in primary care. In addition, viral infections of the sinus cavities are frequently associated with abnormal radiographic findings, and studies of these examinations have shown that they are unable to distinguish between rhinosinusitis caused by bacteria or viruses. Thus, because of the difficulty associated with distinguishing viral from bacterial rhinosinusitis, the guideline recommends reserving the diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis for patients who experience rhinosinusitis symptoms (eg, sinus pain, tooth pain, nasal congestion) for more than 7 days. 14 Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis usually resolves without antibiotic treatment; thus, initial management for mild illness should focus on symptom management (eg, decongestants and anti-inflammatories). 14 In addition, some evidence shows that nasal steroid sprays may reduce both the length and severity of acute rhinosinusitis. 16 Antibiotics should be reserved for patients who are experiencing moderate to severe symptoms. 14 In most situations initial antibiotic selec-Antibiotics do not shorten or alter the course of the common cold and should be avoided.",

Bacteria associated with acute pharyngitis include Streptococcus pyogenes (Groups A, C, and G), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Francisella tularensis, and Yersinia spp, as well as some anaerobes associated with Vincent's angina. 17 However, S pyogenes in the form of Group A \u2424-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) is the most common cause of bacterial pharyngitis and is responsible for 5% to 15% of adult cases of acute pharyngitis. In addition to reducing the complications associated with GABHS (eg, acute rheumatic fever, peritonsillar abscess), treatment of GABHS improves clini-cal symptoms and decreases transmission.Thus, when seeing patients with acute pharyngitis, clinicians should focus on determining whether GABHS is the infective source. 18 Findings commonly associated with GABHS and viral pharyngitis are summarized in Table 2 . However, because these are not exclusive to GABHS or viral pharyngitis, the guideline recommends testing all patients presenting with acute pharyngitis who have features associated with GABHS.Testing should occur with either a pharyngeal culture or rapid antigen detection test (RADT), that typically has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 95% or greater. Unlike children and adolescents, confirmatory cultures of negative RADTs are not routinely recommended in adults because of the low incidence of GABHS and rheumatic fever in this population. 17 Penicillin continues to have good coverage against GABHS and remains the first-line recommended treatment: either penicillin V 500 mg twice daily or 250 mg four times daily for 10 days; however, if compliance is unlikely, a one time dose of 1.2 units of benzathine penicillin can be given. Alternatives to penicillin include the second-generation oral cephalosporins for 4 to 6 days or a macrolide (eg, erythromycin for 10 days, or azithromycin for 5 days). However, there are now macrolide-resistant GABHS strains; thus, culture and sensitivity is recommended when clinical failure is suspected. 15 Symptom management for both viral and GABHS pharyngitis should focus on reducing throat pain through the use of fluids, acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories. 18 A short trial of oral glucocorticoids may be helpful in reducing the pain and swelling associated with severe pharyngitis. 19",

Thus, a short trial of antitussive agents for cough associated with acute bronchitis is reasonable; however, expectorants and mucolytic agents (eg, guaifenesin) were shown to be of no benefit in patients experiencing cough from acute bronchitis and are not recommended for use in routine practice. 23 ",
