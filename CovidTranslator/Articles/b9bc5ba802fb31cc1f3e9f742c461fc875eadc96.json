            "text": "Canine parvovirus is the most widely recognized cause of transmissible viral diarrhea in dogs and one of the most common infectious diseases of dogs worldwide. It is caused by variants of canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2), which are members of the genus Parvovirus. CPV-2 emerged in the early to mid-1970s and caused a worldwide pandemic of illness in dogs. 2 The spread of the virus worldwide occurred over a remarkable period of about 6 months. CPV-2 may have been derived from feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) or a closely related virus of wild carnivores. It has since mutated to CPV-2a in 1979, CPV-2b in 1984, and, most recently, CPV-2c, which was first detected in Italy in 2000 and has subsequently been found worldwide, with the exception of Australia. Separate lineages have been identified in different geographic locations worldwide. 3 The virus uses the transferrin receptor to enter host cells. With the mutation from CPV-2 to CPV-2a, the virus developed the ability to replicate readily in feline cells, and CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c are now responsible for some cases of feline viral enteritis. 4, 5 Feline parvoviral enteritis is further discussed in Chapter 19. CPV-2 variants must be differentiated from CPV-1, also known as canine minute virus, which belongs to the genus Bocavirus. In general, CPV-1 is thought to have minimal pathogenic potential, but it has been associated with abortion in pregnant dogs; respiratory, cardiac, and gastrointestinal signs in neonatal dogs; severe gastroenteritis in adult dogs; and possibly neurologic signs in dogs. [6] [7] [8] Parvoviruses are small, non-enveloped single-stranded DNA viruses ( Figure 14-1, A) that can survive for long periods (over 1 year) in the environment. As a result, contact with virus that persists in the environment is an important means of transmission. Insects and rodents may also serve as mechanical vectors for the virus. Canine parvovirus requires the presence of mitotically active cells in order to replicate. Young animals (6 weeks to 6 months, and especially those less than 12 weeks of age) are more likely to develop severe illness; however, disease can also occur in unvaccinated or improperly vaccinated adult dogs. In North America, Rottweilers, American pit bull terriers, Doberman pinschers, English springer spaniels, and German shepherd dogs appear to be at increased risk for development of parvoviral enteritis, 9, 10 but this has not been the case in other geographic locations. A seasonal distribution of disease has been reported in some geographic locations, which may reflect times when dogs access the outdoors and contact virus in the environment. For example, in Saskatoon, Canada, dogs were three times more likely to be admitted with parvoviral enteritis in July, August, and September, compared with the rest of the year. 9 In other locations, the seasonal pattern of disease has differed or been nonexistent. 11, 12 For dogs older than 6 months of age, intact males were twice as likely as females to develop parvoviral enteritis. 9 A surveillance study from Australia found a correlation between clusters of parvoviral enteritis and regions of relative socioeconomic disadvantage. 12 Other viral pathogens that have been associated with enteritis and diarrhea in dogs are canine distemper virus (CDV) (see Chapter 15) , canine enteric coronavirus ( Figure 14-1, B) , rotaviruses, astroviruses, adenoviruses, caliciviruses, and novel viruses that include a norovirus, kobuvirus, sapovirus, and possibly also a circovirus. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Canine enteric coronavirus primarily causes mild diarrhea in puppies that are less than 6 weeks of age and may be found in co-infections with other viral causes of gastroenteritis, including CPV-2 variants. Rarely, it has been identified as a more significant cause of diarrhea in young dogs. 18 This chapter focuses on canine parvoviral enteritis, which is the most widely recognized and pathogenic viral enteritis of dogs.",

The virus replicates in oropharyngeal lymphoid tissues, after which viremia occurs. Damage occurs to rapidly dividing cells in the gastrointestinal tract, thymus, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. Affected gastrointestinal tissues include the epithelium of the tongue, oral cavity, esophagus, and intestinal tract, and especially the germinal epithelial cells of the intestinal crypts. Neutropenia results not only from infection of the marrow but also sequestration of neutrophils in damaged gastrointestinal tissue. Malabsorption and increased intestinal permeability result. Secondary bacterial infections of the gastrointestinal tract, which may be followed by bacterial translocation, bacteremia, and endotoxemia, play a key role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Mucosal candidiasis has also been described in puppies with parvoviral enteritis (see Chapter 67). The outcome is clinical signs of fever, lethargy, inappetence, vomiting, diarrhea, rapid dehydration, and abdominal pain. Diarrhea is often liquid, foul-smelling, and may contain streaks of blood or frank blood. Ascarid nematodes may be identified in the vomitus of some dogs. Dogs with canine parvoviral enteritis have evidence of disordered coagulation, with decreased antithrombin activities, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, increased thromboelastography maximum amplitude, and increased fibrinogen concentrations. Catheter and organ thrombosis may occur. 20 Secondary bacteremia may be associated with multiple organ failure and death.",

The sensitivities of three commercially available fecal antigen assays (SNAP Parvo antigen, IDEXX Laboratories GmbH; FASTest Parvo Strip, Scil Animal Care Company GmbH; Witness Parvo Card, Selectavet GmbH) were 50%, 40%, and 60%, respectively, when compared to immunoelectron microscopy, and 18%, 16%, and 26%, respectively, when compared with results of a fecal PCR assay. 33 Because some dogs that lack evidence of gastrointestinal signs can be positive using PCR assay, immunoelectron microscopy may be a more appropriate gold standard for disease (although it is not widely available for routine diagnosis). In another study, the sensitivity of a fecal antigen test for detection of CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c, on specimens that contained high CPV DNA loads (>10 5 copies/mg of feces as determined with real-time PCR) was 80%, 78%, and 77%, respectively. 32 When compared with PCR and immunoelectron microscopy of stool, the specificities of the three commercially available antigen assays above were 98%, 98%, and 92%, respectively, 33 so false positives were uncommon.

Attenuated live vaccine virus can also be detected in the feces with PCR assays after vaccination, although assays have been designed that can differentiate between vaccine and wild-type virus. 37 It is not yet clear for how long after vaccination false-positive PCR results might occur, and this could vary based on the design of the PCR assay used.

Whenever possible, the patient should be hospitalized in isolation. Appropriate fluid therapy and maintenance of adequate blood glucose concentrations are the most critical aspect of treatment. Whenever possible, fluids should be given intravenously and supplemented as needed with potassium chloride and dextrose. Blood glucose concentrations should be monitored at least twice daily, and more frequent monitoring may be indicated if hypoglycemia is present. Although not generally recommended for puppies that are vomiting or dehydrated, administration of subcutaneous fluids and antimicrobial drugs in the home can sometimes result in recovery when client finances do not permit treatment in hospital. Fluids administered subcutaneously should never be supplemented with dextrose, because dextrose is hyperosmotic and can cause further dehydration, as well as injection-site reactions. Unfortunately, the owners of many dogs with parvoviral enteritis lack financial resources for treatment. In these situations, the inability to afford vaccination may have been a reason the puppy develops parvoviral enteritis in the first place. An antimicrobial drug or drug combination with activity against gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria should be administered parenterally. Injectable ampicillin or cefazolin alone may be sufficient for many dogs, but puppies that have hemorrhagic diarrhea or evidence of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) should probably be treated with a combination of a penicillin and a fluoroquinolone, or a combination of a penicillin and an aminoglycoside. Use of fluoroquinolones in young, rapidly growing animals has been associated with cartilage damage (see Chapter 8), but when used for the short periods of time required to treat parvoviral enteritis, this may not be of significant concern. Proper hydration is critical before aminoglycosides are used because of their potential for nephrotoxicity.",

Whether plasma or hetastarch is the treatment of choice for dogs with low colloid oncotic pressure requires further study. Plasma may offer benefit over hetastarch in that it contains antibodies from immune dogs, but titers may not be sufficient to be beneficial, and most puppies show evidence of an antibody response within 3 days after onset of clinical signs. Hetastarch has anticoagulant properties that could be beneficial in light of the hypercoagulable state that has been documented in canine parvoviral enteritis, but these effects also have the potential to increase mortality, and hetastarch has been associated with acute kidney injury in critically ill human patients. 41 Early enteral nutrition with a nasogastric feeding tube was associated with reduced hospitalization times in one study, as compared to withholding food until vomiting had ceased (Figure 14-6 ). 42 Gastric suction should be performed through the tube before food is administered.",

As canine parvovirus does not possess a neuraminidase, it has been A B hypothesized that oseltamivir instead may act on the neuraminidases of bacteria that are normally responsible for secondary bacterial infections in parvovirus enteritis, primarily those of the gastrointestinal tract. A single prospective, randomized, masked, placebo-controlled trial of 35 dogs with parvovirus enteritis showed that dogs treated with oseltamivir (2 mg/kg PO q12h) had no significant drop in their leukocyte count, whereas untreated dogs had a significant drop in their leukocyte count in the first 5 days of hospitalization. 44 Treated dogs also gained weight during hospitalization, whereas untreated dogs lost weight. However, there was no difference in hospitalization time, clinical scores, morbidity, or mortality between the two groups, and the number of dogs in each group was small. The authors acknowledged the potential concerns that relate to administration of an oral medication to dogs with enteritis, with possible variability in drug absorption. A major concern that relates to treatment of canine parvoviral enteritis with oseltamivir is the possibility of selection for resistant mutants among influenza viruses if widespread use of the drug occurs in veterinary clinics. Given the restrictions on the use of this drug for treatment of human influenza virus infections, further investigation is required before the widespread use of oseltamivir can be recommended for treatment of CPV enteritis. More information on canine G-CSF, rfIFN-\u03c9, and oseltamivir can be found in Chapter 7 of this book. After recovery from viral enteritis, intestinal parasites should be treated with a broad-spectrum anthelmintic such as fenbendazole.",

Survival may also be lower in Rottweilers when compared to other breeds and in young puppies (less than 7 to 12 weeks of age). 50 In Australia, euthanasia was more likely to occur in summer; among pedigree dogs, in hounds, gundogs, and non-sporting breed dogs; and in puppies less than 6 months of age. 47 Vomiting and lethargy at admission as well as lymphopenia and hypoalbuminemia have been associated with prolongation of hospitalization times by approximately 2 days. 29 Positive changes in leukocyte counts (and especially lymphocyte counts) as early as 24 hours after admission have also been associated with survival. 48 In general, puppies that survive the first 3 to 4 days of treatment make complete recoveries.

If possible, pregnant bitches introduced into shelter environments should be tested for antibody to CPV before vaccination with attenuated live vaccines, and these dogs should only be vaccinated if they test negative. The use of inactivated vaccines is not recommended in contaminated environments, because the window of vulnerability and the time to onset of protection is too long. The window of vulnerability is the period when maternal antibody interferes with the vaccine's ability to stimulate an effective immune response, but does not prevent infection with virulent field virus (see Chapter 12 for a discussion of this concept). Small quantities of attenuated live vaccine virus are shed from the intestinal tract after immunization, but this should not be relied on to immunize other in-contact animals. Protection against challenge with field virus occurs for at least 3 years and possibly for life after the initial puppy series is administered (see Chapter 12) .

For shelters, quarantine periods of 2 weeks have been recommended before introduction of puppies that might be shedding virus, because shedding rarely continues for longer than 10 days. 56 The bathing of recovered puppies can help to remove virus that persists on the haircoat.

The finding of leukopenia and diarrhea is not diagnostic for parvoviral enteritis, because it can also be caused by other severe enteritides such as salmonellosis. The positive fecal real-time PCR assay for CPV supported the diagnosis, but because positive fecal PCR results can occur in healthy dogs with some assays, and also after vaccination, the fecal PCR result alone did not confirm the diagnosis of CPV enteritis. The diagnosis was therefore made on the basis of the combination of findings. The neutropenia in this dog was profound. Infection likely occurred before the owner acquired the puppy because the diarrhea began only 2 days after the puppy was purchased.",
