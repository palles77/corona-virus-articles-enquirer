A report that analyzed 536 patients with SARS-CoV showed 6.7% of acute renal impairment and 84.6% of proteinuria by dipstick tests (13) . Acute respiratory distress syndrome and age were significant risk factors for acute renal impairment, and acute renal impair- ment was an independent risk factor predicting mortality. However, kidney specimens from autopsy cases showed no viral inclusions or electron dense deposits. Even in situ hybridization failed to demonstrate SARS-CoV. This suggested that renal insult occurred in the context of multiple organ failure. Another report also stated that the decrease in glomerular filtration rate was secondary to hypotension, vasoconstriction, and sepsis (14) . However, another study detected SARS-CoV in distal convoluted renal tubules (15) . SARS-CoV patients developed AKI at a median duration of 20 days from the onset of viral infection, i.e., the late viremic or the hyperimmune response phase of the infection (16) . The detection of polymerase chain reaction fragments of coronavirus in urine from 21%-50% of SARS patients between the second and third week of the viral infection implied a possibility of kidney tropism of the coronavirus (14) . Unfortunately, MERS-CoV polymerase chain reaction from urine was performed in only one patient 6 weeks after symptom onset in this cohort to ensure the virus absence from various specimens, and it was negative. We can conclude that the renal pathological changes associated with human coronavirus may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by virus replication, as well as indirectly by a systemic toxic reaction resulting from respiratory failure or a harmful immune response and cytokine reaction induced by viral infection.",

One explanation for the difference in AKI incidence may be the different criteria used to define AKI. In that study, AKI was defined as a SCr elevation at least 30% of the baseline value on admission (3 consecutive blood samplings) or above 1.8 mg/dL. When we adopted the same definition in the present cohort, AKI occurred in 7 patients (23.3%), which is still higher than the AKI incidence of SARS-CoV infection. Another explanation may be the older age of MERS-CoV patients in the present study. The mean age was 54 yr in the present cohort and approximately 39 yr in the SARS-CoV cohort. Because age was an independent risk factor for AKI in both studies, the older age of MERS-CoV patients might explain the higher incidence of AKI in the present study. In a previous study, a patient whose viral RNA was not detected in whole blood or urine samples had a more favorable outcome than a patient who showed disseminated viral infection (22) . The investigators in that study concluded that a type-1 interferon mediated response triggered by MERS-CoV might limit the viral disease to the lung and prevent systemic dissemination and viremia. A decreased immune response in older patients may play a role in the higher occurrence of AKI through viremia and urinary viral excretion, though we did not assess serial viral RNA in blood and urine. In addition, this cohort was from central MERS-CoV designated hospital and we cannot rule out that patients in this cohort had more underlying diseases than other MERS-CoV patients in Korea and that the incidence of AKI occurrence might be overestimated.",
