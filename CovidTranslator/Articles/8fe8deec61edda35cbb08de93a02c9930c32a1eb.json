Staining with anti-MERS-CoV antibodies results in a distinctive pattern of fluorescence in the cytoplasm of infected cells, consisting of fine to coarse granular structures. Samples are reported as positive according to the degree of fluorescence observed when compared to positive and negative controls. Reactions are considered positive when fluorescence is observed in majority of the cells (50-100 cells per low power field).The antigen is coated on slides with 2 Biochips (one Biochip coated with MERS-CoV infected cells (species EU 14) and the other Biochip with noninfected cells (not specified in the instruction leaflet). MERS-CoVspecific antibody is detected using Fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-human IgG. The positive controls are anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA, IgG human). Negative controls antibody were provided by the manufacturer and consisted of human sera known to be negative for antibody reactive with MERS coronavirus and SARS coronavirus. The recommended sample dilution for qualitative evaluation was 1:100 in sample buffer. Only one dilution was used as per instructions.",
