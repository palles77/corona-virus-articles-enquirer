The impact of cholesterol depletion on PTT-induced lysis was reversed by adding exogenous cholesterol and other sterols that support membrane rafts, while sterols that do not support rafts induced only limited reversal. Cholesterol depletion appears to cause a reduced energy barrier to lysis as judged by decreased temperature dependence with M\u03b2CD. Enhancement/replenishment responses to [M\u03b2CD] also were observed for HIV-1 infectivity, consistent with a similar energy barrier effect in the membrane transformation of virus cell fusion. Overall, the results argue that cholesterol in the HIV-1 envelope is important for balancing virus stability and membrane transformation, and that partial depletion, while increasing infectivity, also makes the virus more fragile. The results also reinforce the argument that the lytic inactivation and infectivity processes are mechanistically related and that membrane transformations occurring during lysis can provide an experimental window to investigate membrane and protein factors important for HIV-1 cell entry.",

            "text": "HIV-1 is an enveloped virus, with a lipid bilayer that separates the contents of the virus from the extracellular milieu. HIV-1 has two virus-specific surface proteins that are used for entry. These proteins, gp120 and gp41, form a trimer of gp120-gp41 heterodimers that is commonly denoted the viral spike or Env. For productive infection to take place, initial interactions of the viral spike gp120 component with cellular receptors CD4 and CCR5 1 are followed by conformational changes in gp120 that expose gp41 to the host cell membrane. This is followed by the interaction of the fusogenic tip of gp41 with the cell membrane, and rearrangement of the helical heptad repeat regions within each gp41 subunit of the trimer to form a six-helix bundle. The latter brings the viral and cellular membranes into close proximity to enable membrane fusion. In turn, fusion enables the luminal contents including virus genomic RNA to enter the cell, leading to virus life cycle steps to establish cellular infection and ultimately production of infectious virus. While membrane fusion is known to be critical for virus cell entry and infection, the membrane transformation events occurring during fusion are not fully understood. 2 To inhibit entry of HIV-1, we previously identified peptide triazoles as a class of HIV entry inhibitors that bind to gp120, inhibit it from interacting at either the CD4 or coreceptor binding sites through conformational entrapment, 3 and, in the context of the spike, trigger gp120 shedding. KR-13, which is a peptide triazole thiol (RINNIXWSEAMM\u03b2AQ\u03b2AC-amide, where X = ferrocenyl triazole proline), with a free thiol (PTT) at the C-terminal cysteine residue, not only inhibits HIV-1 infection with nanomolar potency and causes gp120 to be shed from virus, but also triggers the release of luminal p24, thus adding, along with shedding, to the irreversible inactivation of virus in a cell-free environment. 4, 5 The release of p24 suggests the ability of the PTT to perturb the viral envelope without directly interacting with the envelope, leading to a loss of membrane integrity. Lytic p24 release does not appear to occur through fragmentation of the envelope but rather by more limited membrane transformation, since post-KR-13-treated virions visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) retain an intact, although shrunken, physical state. 4 In order to identify properties of the envelope that control the lytic inactivation process, we investigated the effect of progressive cholesterol depletion. Cholesterol is a major constituent of the HIV-1 envelope membrane bilayer, making up 45 mol %. [6] [7] [8] Here, we evaluated the effects of cholesterol depletion on KR-13-triggered HIV-1 lysis by pretreating pseudo-viruses with methyl beta-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD). Pseudo-viruses have been used as a virus model to study the entry process and its antagonism, by providing virus-like particles into which Env spikes from a variety of HIV-1 strains can be incorporated. 9 The main difference between these model viruses and fully infectious viruses is the inability of the pseudo-virus to produce fully infectious viral particles in the cells it infects, since its genetic code contains frame shift mutations. 10, 11 Importantly, pseudo-viruses contain an extra gene that expresses the enzyme luciferase in infected cells, and the chemiluminescence changes upon substrate conversion by this enzyme can be used as a readout for successful infection. Strikingly, we observed a bell-shaped response of pseudo-virus lysis to progressive increase of [M\u03b2CD] that included enhancement of function at intermediate [M\u03b2CD] , even though significant shedding of gp120, the binding target for KR-13 (PTT), occurred under conditions that induced the enhancement of lysis.",

Furthermore, the enhancement effects observed here are reminiscent of similar effects reported previously for influenza virus lipid mixing and liposomal fusion, 12 as well as HIV-1 infectivity, 13 suggesting that cholesterol content provides a balance of function and stability that is generally found in enveloped virus membranes.",

For lysis experiments, the samples were immediately treated with PTT or controls except for the temperature-dependence experiment. For the latter experiment, samples were first treated with 78 \u03bcM M\u03b2CD or PBS for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C and then moved to incubators at different temperatures (4, 8, 16, 23, 30, 37 , and 42 \u00b0C) and equilibrated for 15 min. Simultaneously, solutions containing PTT in separate tubes were also equilibrated at the appropriate temperatures. At the 15 min time point, the PTT was added to the virus/ M\u03b2CD mixture and incubated for another 30 min. All samples were then spun and tested for leaked p24 capsid protein. We assume Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics in a zeroth-order regime in which the concentration of KR-13 exceeds its binding affinity by many orders of magnitude (5 \u03bcM vs 2 nM, 4 according to the Michaelis constant); therefore, we interpret the amount of p24 detected at 30 min divided by 30 min to be the effective maximum rate of lysis. Plots of the natural logarithm of this time-averaged rate vs reciprocal temperature were made to extract values of effective energy barriers. The slopes were calculated from best-fit lines determined using the linear fitting algorithm provided by Origin Pro 9.0.",

Pseudo-typed HIV-1 viruses were first treated with a range of [M\u03b2CD] for 30 min, followed by the addition of KR-13 or a nonlytic parental peptide triazole, HNG-156 (RINNIXWSEAMM-amide, where X is ferrocenyl triazole proline). The concentrations of KR-13 used were based on the EC 50 value first determined for p24 release ( Figure 1A) ; this value was similar to that previously observed. 4 The concentration of HNG-156 used was 5 \u03bcM (final). Treated samples were centrifuged to separate the pelleted virus fraction from the released p24 in the soluble protein fraction. The latter was assayed by sandwich ELISA for p24 content. When pretreated with M\u03b2CD, the KR-13-treated samples (red circles, Figure 1B) showed an initial marked increase in p24 release up to a maximum between 10 and 312 \u03bcM M\u03b2CD, followed by a steep decline at higher concentrations. No p24 release was observed with the addition of either PBS alone (black squares, Figure 1B ) or HNG-156 (blue triangles, Figure 1B) , indicating that the enhancement observed with M\u03b2CD was specific for KR-13. Control experiments (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information) showed that M\u03b2CD had no direct effect on KR-13 binding to soluble gp120. Since M\u03b2CD at high concentrations (>10 000 \u03bcM) has been previously reported to cause lysis, 23 we evaluated the effect of M\u03b2CD alone and found that doses below 10 000 \u03bcM did not cause p24 release ( Figure 1B, black squares) .",

[24] [25] [26] We used this assay to compare the effect of M\u03b2CD treatment on cholesterol content with effects on p24 release and infectivity. Samples of M\u03b2CD-treated virus were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS and then mixed with a cocktail containing cholesterol oxidase, horseradish peroxidase, and 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydrophenoxazine (Amplex Red) to provide a fluorescence readout corresponding to cholesterol content. Treatment with 1\u00d7 PBS alone was used as a negative control, while untreated pseudo-virus was used to determine the 100% value for cholesterol content. The results, shown in Figure 2A , confirm a dosedependent depletion of envelope cholesterol content upon M\u03b2CD treatment, with a midpoint at ~50 \u03bcM. Of note, the envelope cholesterol depletion was incomplete at the highest [M\u03b2CD] used. Since cholesterol depletion was found (data not shown) to be greater (by 30% at intermediate M\u03b2CD concentrations) after the addition of sphingomyelinase, which converts envelope sphingomyelin to ceramide, 27 it is possible that the incomplete removal of cholesterol by M\u03b2CD could be due, at least in part, to stabilizing sphingomyelin-cholesterol interactions in the HIV-1 membrane. 28 We also examined whether the known effect of M\u03b2CD on gp120 shedding 23, 29, 30 occurred at the concentrations found to affect lysis. Pseudo-virus-associated gp120 and gp41 were examined, using Western blots and ELISA, respectively (Methods). The data obtained ( Figure 2B) show that gp120 was released from the residual virus in a dose-dependent manner, with a midpoint at ~10 \u03bcM, while gp41 was retained in the virus fraction.",

Pseudo-virus treated with PBS throughout the experiment was used as the intact virus control (0%), while a detergenttreated sample of pseudo-virus was used as the lysed control (100%). No lysis was observed to occur with any of the sterol variants in the absence of KR-13 (data not shown). As shown in Figure 3 , exogenous cholestanol and dehydrocholesterol reversed the effect of cholesterol depletion, although the derivative-enabled recovery was reduced, compared to that with cholesterol. In contrast, coprostanol, cholestenone, and cholestane induced a much lower suppression of lysis at 78 \u03bcM M\u03b2CD and no recovery at 5000 \u03bcM M\u03b2CD. An expanded dataset showing the sterol effects on lysis is provided in Figures S5B (for cholestanol) , S5C (for coprostanol), and S7A and S7B (for dehydrocholesterol, cholestenone, and cholestane) in the Supporting Information. The reduced recovery of the latter three sterols is most evident in the sample of virus treated with 5000 \u03bcM M\u03b2CD and then with increasing amounts of sterol ( Figure S8 in the Supporting Information). Importantly, the above results show that the effectiveness of a sterol to reverse cholesterol depletion effects on KR-13induced lysis is directly related to its ability to support raft formation in HIV-1.

[19] [20] [21] [22] When treated with M\u03b2CD, DHE fluorescence emission decreased, starting at [M\u03b2CD] > 10 \u03bcM, with a fluorescence minimum at ~312 \u03bcM M\u03b2CD, after which emission intensity increased ( Figure 4D ). The experiment was performed in the presence of 1 M potassium iodide, which should quench any DHE extracted from the membrane by M\u03b2CD. This was verified by an observed 80% decrease in intensity, as shown in Figure S2 . Hence, the fluorescence measured is taken to reflect membrane incorporated DHE only. We surmise that the decreasing trend in fluorescence might be due to the removal of nonraft associated DHE up to ~312 \u03bcM M\u03b2CD. Beyond this threshold, an altered environment is formed around the DHE that is still embedded within the viral membrane. This might occur because very high [M\u03b2CD] and the consequent greatly reduced cholesterol lead to dissolution of membrane rafts. In turn, raft disruption could allow the fluorescent sterol to laterally diffuse within the viral envelope and, because of greater distances between dye molecules, become dequenched. Importantly, the \"inverted bell-shaped\" curve of DHE fluorescence suggests that a membrane transformation occurred at the same range of [M\u03b2CD] as the enhancement of lysis and infectivity.",

Lytic inactivation by KR-13 has been found previously 4 to require gp41 6helix bundle formation, which is a transformation that likely involves traversing an energy barrier. A lower energy barrier for KR-13-induced lysis could explain why greater lytic release occurred at increasing [M\u03b2CD], even though the content of gp120, the binding target for KR-13, was decreased. Samples containing equal amounts of pseudo-virus were treated with PBS (control) or 78 \u03bcM M\u03b2CD for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C before being transferred to an incubator at different temperatures (4, 8, 16, 23, 30, 37, and 42 \u00b0C) . Temperatureequilibrated PBS-containing KR-13 was mixed, and the samples incubated for another 30 min. All samples were then spun and the p24 contents of the fractions containing released protein were measured using sandwich ELISA; the data are provided in Figures S10A and S10B in the Supporting Information. Analysis of these data showed two trends: (1) the natural logarithm of the total amount of lysis (y) was linearly related to inverse temperature, suggesting an Arrhenius-like, barrier-mediated process; and (2) the negative slope of ln(y) vs 1/T is greater for the samples without M\u03b2CD treatment, compared to the samples with M\u03b2CD treatment, suggesting that M\u03b2CD treatment lowers this barrier. Similar data were obtained in experiments at a lower concentration of KR-13 (2 \u03bcM, Figure 5B) , showing that the differences in temperature response are consistently observed at different extents of lytic reaction. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the activation energy for lysis is reduced after M\u03b2CD pretreatment.",

            "text": "The enhancement of HIV-1 lytic inactivation by M\u03b2CD treatment observed in the current work is similar to prior findings of enhanced HIV-1 infectivity by M\u03b2CD. 13 This correlation suggests a common effect of cholesterol depletion on the virus membrane transformation events occurring in virus membrane lysis induced by peptide triazole thiols and virus-cell membrane fusion occurring during infection. We sought to confirm the finding of infectivity enhancement with viruses used in the current lysis study. Samples of BaL.01 HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses were treated with PBS (control) or 78 \u03bcM M\u03b2CD before being washed and added to cells expressing receptors. HIV-1 BaL.01 pseudo-virus infectivity indeed was enhanced under [M\u03b2CD] conditions that cause lysis enhancement (see Figure 6 ). An expanded analysis of infectivity vs concentration of M\u03b2CD, showing the sensitization/ enhancement zone and the suppression zone, is provided in Figure S11 in the Supporting Information. The infectivity changes observed with cholesterol replenishment were similar for sterols that support raft formation (cholestanol and 7-dehydrocholesterol), while the sterols that do not support rafts (coprostanol, cholestenone, and cholestane) induced no significant differences from the samples treated with M\u03b2CD alone (see Figure 6 ). When a similar treatment was performed on viruses without pseudo-typed spikes (containing the capsid core coated with a lipid bilayer), neither lysis nor infection was observed in the [M\u03b2CD] dose range examined (data not shown). When the M\u03b2CD treatment was performed on virus-free cells, which were then washed before addition of untreated viruses, no change in infectivity was observed (data not shown). Of note, infectivity enhancement was also observed in the current work with JR-FL and YU2 (a Tier 2, less easily neutralized strain vs a laboratory-adapted strain) pseudo-typed HIV-1 (142% vs 210%, respectively; see Figure  7C ). The variable extent of infectivity enhancement observed with these latter viruses fits with the prior finding of more-subdued M\u03b2CD enhancement effects reported with other pseudo-typed viruses (LAI, 150% 13 ).",

            "text": "The current investigation was undertaken to evaluate the role of membrane cholesterol depletion on the previously observed potent and specific lytic inactivation of HIV-1 by peptide triazole thiols, such as KR-13, 4,5 that bind to gp120 and trigger release of luminal p24. Prior work 13, 23, 29, 30 had already shown that large-scale cholesterol depletion by high concentrations of M\u03b2CD (>500 \u03bcM) causes HIV-1 disruption and inactivation, as judged by gp120 shedding and loss of cell infection activity. Here, we observed a similar loss of lytic inactivation activity at high [M\u03b2CD] . However, importantly, we found that low-tointermediate [M\u03b2CD] instead caused a significant enhancement of lytic inactivation ( Figure  1B) . The enhancement effect, which we visualize to occur by \"sensitization\" of the virus membrane to transformation, occurred in the same [M\u03b2CD] dose range at which substantial cholesterol depletion and gp120 shedding occurred (see Figures 2A and 2B) . The effects of M\u03b2CD on lysis were reversed by adding cholesterol. M\u03b2CD concentrations causing lytic enhancement also affected membrane lipid bilayer organization ( Figure 4D ) but not fluidity ( Figure 4C ), as judged using membrane-incorporated fluorophores (dehydroergosterol vs Laurdan). The enhancement of lysis with partial cholesterol depletion may be related to a decrease in the energy barrier to membrane transformation, as judged by the reduced slope in the rate of lysis with M\u03b2CD pretreatment vs without M\u03b2CD pretreatment over a range of temperatures (see Figures 5A and 5B ). In accordance with prior findings, 13 Results obtained in this work argue that cholesterol depletion effects on lysis and infectivity are specific and likely due to alterations in the virus membrane. The ability to reconstitute the functional phenotype of the untreated virus by sterol replenishment after M\u03b2CD treatment demonstrates that the M\u03b2CD effect is reversible and dependent mainly on sterol content in the virus membrane. The extent of regain of phenotype upon replenishment is dependent on the extent to which the replenishing sterol supports raft formation, which is consistent with the previously observed importance of rafts for virus infectivity. 13 While we did not directly measure the amounts of replenishment by different sterol derivatives, prior published results have demonstrated only relatively minor variability of passive incorporation of sterols of the types used here. 13, 36 This allows the correlation in the current work of the sterol type with lysis/infectivity enhancement. Furthermore, we confirmed that the virus fractions used in this work were fully depleted in CD45 protein (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) and, hence, do not contain exosomes that could confound monitoring of biochemical effects due to nonspecific release of gp120 or p24 upon M\u03b2CD treatments. The fact that the M\u03b2CD effects observed in this work are due to specific changes in membrane order fits with the observed correlation of enhancement with changes in the fluorescence of the reporter DHE incorporated into the virus envelope membrane (compare Figure 4D and Figure 1B) .",

Importantly, retention of HIV-1 infectivity has been previously shown to tolerate reduced gp120 produced by either enzymatic removal of inactive spikes 17 or lower incorporation of trimer on recombinant virus. 37 Still, the extent of gp120 shedding induced at lysis-enhancing concentrations of M\u03b2CD is substantial. One possible explanation for this paradox is that any reduction of lysis due to loss of gp120 is counterbalanced by a reduction of the energy barrier for lytic transformation of the virus particles. This explanation is supported by the observed decrease in slope of the lysis-temperature dependence relationship after virus pretreatment with 78 \u03bcM M\u03b2CD (Figures 5A and 5B) . The virus spike is known to be metastable, with receptor binding to Env able to drive a cascade of conformational transitions leading from a high energy Env unliganded state to a residual low energy form in which gp41 has formed a 6helix bundle. 2 Depleting cholesterol could lower the energy barrier to gp41 6-helix bundle formation, which has been found previously to be a component not only of the entry/ infection process 2 but also of the lysis process. 4 This may occur because cholesterol can act as a stabilizing agent of membrane-spanning proteins both by forming raft structures 38, 39 and by directly binding to the proteins through interactions with CRAC domains as observed with CCR5, 40 \u03b22 adrenergic receptor, 41 serotonin 1A receptor, 42 and the oxytocin receptor. 43 Importantly, gp41 contains a CRAC domain. 44, 45 The fact that the existing cholesterol content on the native virus does not result in the most sensitized state of the spike is noteworthy. The current work argues that the depletion of cholesterol with M\u03b2CD would result in a more unstable Env spike, which would be more vulnerable to ligand-induced rearrangement, shedding, and perturbation of the associated membrane. Hence, the cholesterol content found on the native virus strikes a balance between stability and transformability of the virus spike, as depicted in Figure 8 .",

            "text": "We found in this work that enhancement of ligand-induced virus lysis at intermediate cholesterol depletion correlates with infectivity enhancement, which is a phenomenon that has been observed previously 13 and amplified in the current study. The extent of M\u03b2CD dose dependence and sterol replenishment are similar for both lysis and infectivity. Of note, the magnitude of infectivity enhancement previously reported to occur at elevated M\u03b2CD was lower than that observed in the current study. The quantitative differences in the extent of infectivity enhancement in this and prior work may be due to the use of different viruses, as shown here by differences with BaL01, YU2, and JR-FL pseudo-types ( Figure 6 vs Figure 7C ). As with lysis (discussed above), infectivity enhancement by M\u03b2CD concentrations that decrease the amount of gp120 presents a paradox of increased function in the face of decreasing the Env spike required for function. We envision that the lower energy barrier effect found here for lysis would also explain increased infectivity with a virus containing reduced gp120. This is consistent with the previously observed finding that lysis and infection have mechanistic similarities, including a role for gp41 6-helix bundle formation in both processes. 4 The results argue that cholesterol stabilizes the virus for survival and that increased infectivity from cholesterol depletion comes at a cost of lower stability and, hence, decreased survival. This relationship is depicted in Figure 8 .",

[6] [7] [8] 12, 46, 47 For example, a bell-shaped effect of cholesterol depletion on biophysical properties of liposomal fusion and content mixing rates for the influenza virus has been reported. 12 Hence, defining the nature of membrane transformations that occur in the enhancement of function caused by cholesterol depletion in HIV-1, including how these transformations are associated with Env spike protein, could help improve the general understanding of the fusion mechanism for Type I viruses. Such studies also could help in understanding the nature of membrane transformations triggered by Env protein ligands such as KR-13, and, in turn, how such lytic ligands could serve as prototypes to define strategies for virus neutralization by harnessing the vulner-abilities of enveloped virus membranes.",
