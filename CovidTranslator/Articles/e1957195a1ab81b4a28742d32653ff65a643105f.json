As a result of IFN signaling, a wide array of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) products is upregulated to target different stages of the viral life cycle. We review recent findings implicating a subset of ISGs in translational regulation of viral and host mRNAs. Translation inhibition is mediated either by binding to viral RNA or by disrupting physiological interactions or levels of the translation complex components. In addition, many of these ISGs localize to translationally silent cytoplasmic granules, such as stress granules and processing bodies, and intersect with the microRNA (miRNA)-mediated silencing pathway to regulate translation of cellular mRNAs.",

Viral PAMPs are often nucleic acid-based, derived from their DNA or RNA genomes. Several pattern recognition receptor families located in various cellular compartments work together to sense PAMPs leading to activation of the transcription factors interferon (IFN)-regulatory factors 3 or 7 (IRF3/7) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF\u03baB) (for a recent review see [98] ). The signaling events following PAMP recognition result in dimerization and translocation of IRF3/7 into the nucleus along with NF\u03baB, leading to the transcription and expression of type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines, which in turn get secreted by the cell. Autocrine or paracrine signaling in response to IFN induces downstream expression of an array of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which function to establish an antiviral state [98] .",

In the rest of the review, we will refer to the protein as ZAP. ZAP is transcriptionally upregulated by type I IFN signaling and directly induced by phosphorylated IRF3 in virus-infected cells [95, 117] . There are at least two splice variants of ZAP-ZAPL (PARP13.1) and ZAPS (PARP13.2), where the long isoform encodes a PARP domain on the C-terminus that is missing in the short isoform [52] . While both isoforms are induced, ZAPS is upregulated more than ZAPL by virus and type I IFN [43, 74, 103] . ZAP was first discovered as a potent antiviral factor against the retrovirus, Moloney Li et al.",

            "text": "Viruses are completely reliant on host cell translational machinery to produce the proteins encoded by their genes. In eukaryotic cells, translation is initiated (summarized in Figure 1 and recently reviewed in [48] ) by binding of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E to the m7G cap structure at the 5' end of mRNAs. Meanwhile, poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) binds to the poly(A) tail at the 3' end of mRNAs. Both eIF4E and PABP interact with the scaffold protein eIF4G, leading to mRNA circularization and recruitment of the 43S preinitiation complex, the minimal constituents of which include the eIF3 complex (13 subunits; a-m), the ternary complex eIF2-GTPMet-tRNA i and the 40S ribosomal subunit. The 43S complex then scans the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA until it reaches the translational start codon. Ribosome scanning is aided by the RNA helicase, eIF4A, which disrupts secondary and tertiary structures in the 5' UTR. The 60S ribosomal subunit then joins the 40S ribosomal subunit to form the 80S ribosome, resulting in translation initiation and elongation; formation of polyribosomes (polysomes) where multiple ribosomes simultaneously translate the same mRNA can then take place. Because translation initiation is a complex and highly ordered process, most of the translational regulation in eukaryotic cells occurs at this step [48] . Several ISG products, such as zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP), interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1) and schlafen 11 (SLFN11), have been shown to affect viral or global protein synthesis, and their modes of action are described in this section. The common strategies shared by these ISGs include direct binding to viral RNA, and interaction with or perturbation of the translation machinery components, preventing translation. murine leukemia virus (MLV), in a cDNA library screen [31] . Since then it has been shown to inhibit a broad range of RNA and DNA viruses, including other retroviruses, alphaviruses, filoviruses and hepatitis B virus [11, 74, 79, 119, 128] . It is not understood what determines the broad yet specific antiviral activity of ZAP. It binds viral RNA via its N-terminal zinc fingers, and ZAP-responsive sequence elements in MLV and Sindbis virus have been mapped [39] . ZAP recruits the exosome to target retroviral and specific host mRNAs for degradation [16, 40, 113, 128] but also acts to block viral genome translation [11] . ZAP dramatically reduces Sindbis virus production, and experiments utilizing temperature sensitive Sindbis virus mutants that are unable to replicate the RNA genome at nonpermissive temperatures support a mechanism in which ZAP represses translation of the incoming viral genome [11] . ZAP also inhibits translation of luciferase reporters that carry the ZAP-responsive elements from HIV-1 and Sindbis virus [129] . ZAP binds to eIF4A and interferes with the interaction between eIF4A and eIF4G, and as a result blocks translation independently of mRNA degradation [129] (Figure 1 ).",

Furthermore, mass spectrometry identified ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in translation as interacting partners of mPARP12L. mPARP12L interacts with ribosomes in the polysome-containing fractions at 4h post-infection (pi) with VEEV but facilitates disassembly of polysomes at later times of infection (12h pi), which is dependent on its RNA-binding and PARP catalytic activities [5, 121] (Figure 1 ). mPARP12L mutants that are unable to transfer ADP-ribose to substrate proteins, including mPARP12L itself, fail to block translation; however, they are still able to inhibit replication of GFP-expressing VEEV. One possible explanation is that mPARP12L utilizes an unknown mechanism to block VEEV replication that is unrelated to poly-ADP-ribosylation and translational inhibition. The PARP domain's role in mediating translational inhibition and mPARP12L's catalytic activity-independent antiviral function warrant further studies.",

Structural studies and binding assays also support a role for IFIT1 in recognizing single-stranded viral RNA bearing a 5'-triphosphate group, which results in translation inhibition, although binding appears to be of lower affinity than IFIT1 binding to 5' capped RNA lacking 2'-O-methylation [1, 57, 84] . Intriguingly, alphaviruses do not carry a 2'-O-methylated cap but instead have evolved a stable secondary structure in their 5' UTRs to evade IFIT1 recognition and translational repression [47] . Taken together, IFIT1 is a critical innate immune effector that inhibits viruses whose RNAs lack a 2'-O-methylated cap.",

IFIT1 was also identified as an eIF3-associated protein fractionating with hepatitis C virus (HCV) translation complexes in IFN-treated cells [116] . IFIT1 blocks translation driven by the HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and the inhibition depends on eIF3 binding by IFIT1. IRESs are RNA elements that recruit the ribosome to internal sites in the mRNA in a cap-independent manner [48] . The HCV IRES interacts with eIF3 and 40S ribosomal subunit to initiate translation and therefore is prone to eIF3 inhibition by IFIT1. However, in another study that interrogated the effects of IFIT1 on different modes of translation, IFIT1 preferentially inhibits cap-dependent translation but not translation of the EMCV IRES [46] . Since the EMCV IRES is different than that of HCV and functions by a different mechanism, the former might have a different requirement for eIF3 and hence is more resistant to IFIT1 effects.",

Human schlafen 11 (SLFN11) has been shown to block the production of wild type HIV-1 by inhibiting the translation of viral proteins [67] . Schlafen genes are a subset of ISGs that are found only in mammals and possess motifs resembling DNA/RNA helicase domains.

It is covalently attached to lysine residues of target proteins, and has been found as a modification on newly translated proteins of both viral and host origin [78] . Replication of many viruses is blocked by ISG15 in vitro and/or in vivo, and for some of these viruses, ISG15 acts at the step of virus release [78] . Previously, Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) 2A protease was shown to cleave the host cell eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4G, leading to host cell translational shutoff in infected cells while allowing IRES-driven translation of the viral genome [34] . Interestingly, CVB3 2A protease is modified by ISG15, and the modified protease is less efficient at cleaving eIF4G in both HeLa cells and cardiomyocytes [87] (Figure 1 ). Indeed, inhibition of virus production and decreased CVB3induced pathology were observed in wild type mice compared to ISG15 knockout animals [87] . The data suggest a previously unappreciated role for ISG15 modification in subversion of virus-induced translational shutoff. However, further studies are necessary to determine if this strategy applies to other viruses that cause host shutoff.",

Polysomes can be dissembled by cues of translational silencing or deadenylation, and the mRNA is redirected to cytoplasmic RNA granules for regulated translation and/or decay (for recent reviews see [2, 12] ). Upon exposure to stress-inducing stimuli, such as oxidation, hypoxia, and virus infection, translationally stalled mRNAs, 40S ribosomal subunits, and several RNA-binding proteins localize to distinct cytoplasmic foci called stress granules (SGs) (Figure 2 ). In most cases, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, triggered by stress inducers including the chemical sodium arsenite, results in the assembly of SGs. Alternatively, acute energy starvation or the drug pateamine A can induce SG formation by an eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylationindependent mechanism. SGs are believed to mediate antiviral processes and in response viruses have evolved strategies to interfere with SG formation, although in some cases SG formation acts in a proviral manner (for a recent review see [82] ). Further, cytoplasmic processing bodies (PBs) contain untranslated mRNAs and can serve as sites of mRNA degradation ( Figure 2 ). There is evidence in support of dynamic interactions between SGs and PBs where mRNA species from dissociated polysomes get remodeled in SGs and some of them are subsequently targeted for degradation in PBs [12] .",

The cytoplasmic RNase III enzyme Dicer then cleaves pre-miRNAs into miRNA duplexes where one strand is guided to its targets by Ago.

In response to arseniteinduced oxidative stress, PARP12 of both human and murine origin colocalizes in cytoplasmic puncta with well-characterized components of SGs, such as Ras GTPaseactivating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1), the T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen 1related protein (TIAR), and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3\u03b7 (eIF3\u03b7) subunit [63, 121] (Figure 2 ). The ability to localize to SGs is dependent on mPARP12's N-terminal zinc fingers, suggesting a role for RNA binding in SG localization. Similar to PARP12, both ZAP isoforms localize to cytoplasmic SGs after sodium arsenite treatment (Figure 2) , and in addition become poly-ADP-ribosylated, as does Ago2 [63] . ADP-ribose addition to ZAPS and ZAPL must be carried out by other cytoplasmic PARP proteins because ZAPL lacks auto-ADP-ribosylating activity and is predicted to be an inactive PARP enzyme, and ZAPS lacks the PARP domain completely [58, 63] . There was some evidence suggesting that human PARP12 might be one of the SG-specific PARPs that ADP-ribosylates ZAP and/or Ago2 [63] . Interestingly, the short isoform of ZAP has a higher level of ADP-ribosylation than ZAPL upon pateamine A treatment, supporting distinct roles for ZAP isoforms in the cellular response to stress [63] .",

Therefore, the finding that ADP-ribosylation of Ago2 increases upon stress is novel and implies important functions for this post-translational modification in cytoplasmic processes [63] . The resultant ADP-ribosylation of Ago2 after stress or overexpression of either ZAPS or ZAPL correlates with derepression of miRNA-mediated translational silencing of luciferase reporters that contain siRNA or miRNA binding sites in their 3' UTRs [63, 103] . Overexpression of human PARP12 also leads to relief of silencing of a luciferase reporter with miRNA binding sites, albeit less dramatically compared to ZAP overexpression [63] . Because many ISGs are anti-proliferative, their constitutive expression levels in the cells are presumably low and tightly regulated. It was postulated that due to an increased density of miRNA binding sites in the 3' UTRs of ISGs compared to all cellular 3' UTRs, the mRNAs of ISGs are selectively repressed under normal physiological conditions to maintain cellular homeostasis [103] . However, ISG mRNAs are derepressed during viral infection to allow upregulation of antiviral gene expression (Figure 3 ). In this case, ADPribose serves as the signaling molecule that switches off RISC activity in order to upregulate ISG expression and eliminate the virus. This derepression of miRNA activity on ISGs has so far been shown to contribute to inhibition of herpes simplex virus 1 and a mutant influenza A virus that induces a stronger antiviral response than the wild type virus [103] . ZAPS, ZAPL and potentially PARP12 are important components of stress-induced relief of RISC activity, although the mechanism by which they act remains unclear.",

Interestingly, MOV10 is critical for regulation of local protein synthesis at synapses where cellular mRNAs normally suppressed by miRNAs enter the polysomes once MOV10 is targeted for degradation in response to synaptic stimulation [10] .",

            "text": "One controversy in the RNAi field is what determines the different repressive mechanisms following miRNA and siRNA targeting. Identification of specific host factors or differential complex formation required for miRNA function may help elucidate the different outcomes of targeted transcripts. Using fractions isolated from cells a minimal RISC complex, consisting of Dicer, the HIV-1 TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP), and Ago2, cleaves target RNA with perfect complementarity; use of a pre-miRNA hairpin as the source of siRNA results in more efficient target cleavage than a mature miRNA duplex [18, 36] . These studies provide evidence for the coupling of miRNA processing by Dicer and Ago2mediated target cleavage. Alternatively, a larger fraction containing the minimal RISC complex components as well as MOV10, core proteins of the 60S ribosomal subunit, and eIF6, a ribosome inhibitory protein, resulted in translational repression and downregulation of target mRNAs [17] (Figure 3) . It was proposed that eIF6 prevents ribosome association or recycling and recruits target RNAs to PBs, which are free of core translation components. In contrast to these studies, silencing experiments implicate MOV10 in both mRNA cleavage mediated by a perfectly matching miRNA and translation repression mediated by an imperfectly matching miRNA [69] . In support of the role of MOV10 in mRNA cleavage, APOBEC3G, another ISG that localizes to cytoplasmic PBs, inhibits miRNA function mediated by perfect complementarity sites by interfering with the interaction between Ago2 and MOV10, causing either abnormal assembly or maturation of the RISC complex [69, 122] . Taken together, MOV10 interacts with Ago2 and is critical for the function of the RISC, but the relative contribution of MOV10 to different repressive mechanisms of miRNAs is still controversial and needs to be further explored.",

A-to-I RNA editing leads to nucleotide substitution as I is recognized by the cell as guanosine, and affects the coding of the protein that is ultimately made. Intriguingly, the majority of A-to-I editing targets in the cell are noncoding RNAs [6, 56, 64, 88, 96, 124] . All members of the ADAR family (ADAR1, 2 and 3) contain a deaminase domain at their C-terminal end that is required for enzymatic activity and two to three double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs). ADAR1 also contains Z-DNA-binding domains (ZBDs) in its amino-terminus. ADAR1 has been implicated in the editing of a variety of viral genomes, which either drives genetic diversity of the population and generates novel viral protein variants or limits viral replication and reduces infectivity [7, 14, 15, 59, 61, 71, 73, 90, 108, 110, 111, 127] .",

            "text": "Previous studies suggested conflicting roles for ADAR1 in both facilitating and interfering with miRNA processing through direct interaction with components of the RNAi pathway or A-to-I editing of miRNAs ( Figure 3 ). Altered miRNA seeds due to A-to-I editing could lead to altered translation profiles. Both ADAR1 p110 and p150 physically interact with Dicer in an RNA-independent manner to increase the rate of cleavage of pre-miRNA by Dicer, and thus facilitate loading of miRNA onto the RISC [83] . As expected, miRNA expression is downregulated in ADAR1 \u2212/\u2212 mouse embryos compared to wild type, leading to increased protein levels of the predicted miRNA targets [83] . Furthermore, miR-376 cluster transcripts undergo extensive A-to-I editing in select human and mouse tissues as well as specific subregions of the brain, and the edited miRNAs target a different set of genes, suggesting a role for ADAR1 in tissue-specific regulation of gene expression [51] . Conversely, ADAR1 p110 can edit specific A residues in pri-miRNAs and negatively affect the miRNA pathway. Editing of one of the ADAR1 targets, pri-miR-142, leads to decreased processing by Drosha and its degradation by Tudor-SN, a RISC-specific ribonuclease that targets I-containing dsRNAs [126] . ADAR1 can also block virus infection through editing of miRNAs. Surprisingly, ADAR1 p110 but not the IFN-induced p150 is upregulated during cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and edits miR-376a, the precursor of which is a known target of ADAR1 [51] . The edited mature miR-376a downregulates HLA-E expression, and as a result infected cells become more susceptible to elimination by natural killer cells, suggesting an indirect antiviral role for the constitutive form of ADAR1 [80] .",

            "text": "The innate immune response has developed multiple strategies to attack viral intruders through the action of effector proteins induced by type I IFN. A common antiviral strategy shared among some of these ISGs is to cause dysregulation of viral or host translation through interaction with translation factors and components of the RNAi pathway, and facilitation of stress-induced post-translational modification and function of Ago2. However, several important questions remain to be addressed. Are SGs functional sites of antiviral signaling triggered by sensing of viral RNA and translational inhibition? For example, ZAP has been shown to interact with the cytosolic viral RNA sensor RIG-I to enhance IFN-\u03b2 production and NF-\u03baB signaling [43] . Can viral RNA binding and sequestration by some of these SG-specific ISGs activate cytosolic sensors to relay innate immune signaling? Moreover, for some of the ISGs mentioned, for example, ZAP and ADAR1, one of their isoforms is constitutively expressed in the cell whereas the other is induced by IFN. It is possible that the constitutively expressed form is also upregulated by IFN, albeit to a lower level compared to the IFN-inducible form. To add to the complexity, there is evidence supporting differential upregulation of the two different ADAR1 isoforms by different viruses, blurring the line between constitutively expressed and IFN-inducible forms [80] . How do the different isoforms of ISGs coordinate their activity upon viral infection, and how does that affect the antiviral response? What are the mechanisms by which ADPribosylation (and other post-translational modifications) triggers changes in protein function? We have much to learn regarding the details of these translational control mechanisms. It will be interesting to ponder new information that is uncovered regarding the processes described here and how they might be exploited for manipulation of viral or host translation for novel antiviral or therapeutic strategies.",

            "text": "Before the discovery of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), it was known that treatment of animal cells with IFN confers upon them resistance to new virus infections. IFN is not directly antiviral; cellular transcription and protein synthesis were found to be required for IFN to work, suggesting that IFN signaling leads to the translation of an inhibitory protein(s). The inhibitory activity targets an early stage of the viral life cycle, specifically the translation of the viral mRNA [50, 77] . Protein synthesis in lysates prepared from mouse L cells pretreated with IFN was blocked upon exposure to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) [20, 54] . It appeared that a dsRNA-dependent protein kinase(s) and an oligonucleotide inhibitor (pppA2'-5'A2'-5'A) were involved [9, 21, 44, 53, 55, 62, 91, 92, 130] . It is now well appreciated that protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) is a serinethreonine kinase and when activated by dsRNA becomes autophosphorylated and phosphorylates the \u03b1 subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1), leading to the inhibition of host and viral mRNA translation [29, 45, 60, 65, 66, 97, 123] . In addition, activation of the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) by dsRNA triggers the synthesis of 2'-5'A from ATP, which causes the dimerization and activation of a latent endoribonuclease (later referred to as RNAse L) [45, 89] . RNAseL causes the degradation of viral or cellular RNA leading to translation inhibition [8, 19, 104] . ",

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) transfer ADP-ribose from the co-substrate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) onto specific amino acid residues of substrate proteins. Seventeen PARPs exist in humans, all with a conserved PARP domain, and nearly one-third of the PARP genes contain signatures of rapid evolution in primates [23] . Some of the PARPs carry the enzymatic activity to modify proteins with poly-ADPribose (pADPr) or mono-ADP-ribose (mADPr), whereas others are inactive, based primarily on the presence or absence of a catalytic triad motif of histidine, tyrosine, and glutamate (HYE) that is required for transferring the initial ADPr and/or multiple ADPr molecules [58] . Most of the PARP proteins can also auto-ADP-ribosylate themselves. Alternatively, poly-ADPr-glycohydrolase (PARG) removes the pADPr chain leaving the most proximal ADPr still attached to the target protein [26, 105] . Searches for enzymes that reverse mono-ADP-ribosylated proteins back to their unmodified state have been elusive until recently when cellular macrodomains were shown to reverse mono-ADPribosylation [49, 94] . The presence of macrodomain motifs in multiple diverse viruses such as alphaviruses, coronaviruses, rubella and hepatitis E viruses suggests that the metabolism of this post-translational modification might be critical for viral antagonism of host responses. In this review, we will discuss some of the recent findings related to the novel roles of ISGs in the PARP family in stress granule formation and stress response-induced translational derepression of miRNA targets, involving PARP12, ZAPL/PARP13.1 and ZAPS/PARP13.2.",

            "text": "Translation initiation involves binding of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E to the m7G cap structure at the 5' end of mRNAs (middle top). Both eIF4E and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) interact with the scaffold protein eIF4G, leading to mRNA circularization. The 43S preinitiation complex, which consists of the eIF3 complex (13 subunits; a-m), the ternary complex eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA i and the 40S ribosomal subunit, is then recruited (top left). The 43S complex scans the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA, which is unwound by the RNA helicase eIF4A until the initiating AUG is found. As a result, the 60S ribosomal subunit joins the 40S ribosomal subunit to form the 80S ribosome, resulting in translation initiation and elongation, and formation of polyribosomes (polysomes) on the mRNA (middle bottom). The ISGs that target some of the translation initiation and elongation steps are depicted in red. Li Polysomes can be dissociated by signals of translational silencing or deadenylation, and the actively translating mRNA is redirected to SGs and PBs for repression or triage. Messenger ribonucleoproteins can also move from one type of granule to the other. ISGs that are localized to SGs upon stress induction and to PBs are shown as stars. The mammalian RNAi pathway is depicted here. The RNase III enzyme Drosha first processes longer primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts into pre-miRNA hairpins in the nucleus. After nuclear export, pre-miRNAs are cleaved into miRNA duplexes by Dicer in the cytoplasm and loaded onto Ago2. The minimal RISC complex (Dicer-TRBP-Ago2) targets transcripts with extensive or perfect sequence complementarity to the miRNA leading to mRNA cleavage, whereas imperfect sequence complementarity between the target transcript and miRNA leads to translational silencing, deadenylation and mRNA degradation. ISGs interacting with different components of the RNAi pathway are shown as stars. A-to-I editing by ADAR1 either leads to (a) decreased processing and increased degradation of pri-miRNA [126] , or (b) silencing of a different set of gene targets [51] . The involvement of MOV10 in different repressive mechanisms of miRNA is controversial and therefore highlighted by question marks.",
