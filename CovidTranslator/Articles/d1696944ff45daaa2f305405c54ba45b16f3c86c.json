The longitudinal tracking of re-24 exposure after the disappeared symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2-infected monkeys was 25 performed in this study. We found that weight loss in some monkeys, viral replication 26 mainly in nose, pharynx, lung and gut, as well as moderate interstitial pneumonia at 7 27 days post-infection (dpi) were clearly observed in rhesus monkeys after the primary 28 infection. After the symptoms were alleviated and the specific antibody tested positively, 29 the half of infected monkeys were rechallenged with the same dose of SARS-CoV-2 30 strain. Notably, neither viral loads in nasopharyngeal and anal swabs along timeline nor 31 viral replication in all primary tissue compartments at 5 days post-reinfection (dpr) was 32 found in re-exposed monkeys. Combined with the follow-up virologic, radiological and 33 pathological findings, the monkeys with re-exposure showed no recurrence of 19, similarly to the infected monkey without rechallenge. Taken together, our results were testing positive after their release from the hospital and had to return to the hospital 45 for observation 3, 4 . Doubts about whether patients have a risk of \"relapse\" or 46 \"reinfection\" after recovery from initial infection have aroused the worldwide concern. 47 Therefore, in this study, we used the nonhuman primate models with SARS-CoV-2 48 infection followed by the same virus rechallenge to ascertain the possibility of 49 reinfection.",

After blocking in 1% normal goat 258 serum for 1 hour at roomtemperature, the slices were stained with 7D2 monoclonal 259 antibody (laboratory preparation 7 ) at 4\u2103 overnight, following with the incubation of The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 ",
