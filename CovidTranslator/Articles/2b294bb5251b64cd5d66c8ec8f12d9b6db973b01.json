Nonetheless, data interpretation and real understanding of viral dynamics is still hampered by the sheer complexity of the various intertwined spatio-temporal processes. In this paper we present a tool to address these issues: a cellular automata model describing critical aspects of in vitro viral infections taking into account spatial characteristics of virus spreading within a culture well. The aim of the model is to understand the key mechanisms of SARS-CoV infection dynamics during the first 24 h post infection. Using a simulated annealing algorithm we tune free parameters with data from SARS-CoV infection of cultured lung epithelial cells. We also interrogate the model using a Latin Hypercube sensitivity analysis to identify which mechanisms are critical to the observed infection of host cells and the release of measured virus particles.",

Near pandemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), resulting in 8096 infected cases and a 9.6% death rate, have provided unfortunate reminders their continued health risk and significant economic impact [6] . New research projects are being funded to investigate the different scales of threat, from the epidemiological spread of a virus in a population to its early phases of the infection in a cell culture. Among the papers published on this topic, in particular on the influenza virus [7] [8] [9] , there are Bocharov's ODE model [10] and Beauchemin's CA model [3, 4, 11] . Both models described the dynamics of the influenza infection in the upper epithelial areas of the lungs and were validated by clinical data. Although they take into account the effect of the immune system on the dynamics of the disease, describing the infection until its final outcome (more than a week after the first infection), none of them analyzed which mechanisms where critical in the dynamics of the first and second round of infection. To understand the key mechanisms of viral respiratory diseases, we focus instead on early phases of viral infection by using in vitro experiments observing lung cells up to 24 h post infection (PI). The in vitro experiments provide measurements of virus titer, spatial characteristics of cell growth and, through green fluorescent protein (GFP) imaging, of the infection spread.",

The choice of a CA model was natural since the in vitro infections being studied use host lung cancer cell lines that form a fixed monolayer in which spatially dependent aspects of infection may be present [12, 13] . We developed this computational model using the Multi-Agent System Visualization (MASyV) platform [3] . In contrast to previous models, we explicitly focus on the dynamics of virus spread on a population of cells, supported by experimental data from an in vitro model system. We also explicitly model the infectious viral particles as discrete entities, whereas in previous models the infection of cells followed simple CA rules depending on the states of neighboring cells. These viral particles are released by infected cells according to a specific function based on time post infection, and move over the well with a random walk algorithm.",

The \u223clog 10 3 viral titer measurements at time points 0, 4 and 7 h post infection are residual virus left over from the initial infection after washing. We set the delay for release of new infectious viral particles to 7 h to represent the jump in observed virus titer between 7 and 12 h. Cells release virus particles according to a viral release function, described below. Virus particles are entities that diffuse from one lattice point to another according to a random walk algorithm (Section 2.4). These free-floating virus particles stochastically infect uninfected cells in a second round of infection. The CA lattice is therefore like a tissue of immobile cells with infective virions moving over it. We represent only infectious viral particles to relate their count in the model with the viral titer measured in terms of plaque forming unit per mL (PFU/mL). A PFU is a measure of the number of viral particles capable of forming plaques per unit of volume, thus only infectious particles are counted in the viral titer. The CA lattice is updated synchronously and the boundary conditions for both the epithelial and viral particles are periodic, i.e., epithelial cells and viral particles can grow or move outside the boundary of the virtual well. We use a Honeycomb neighborhood: each lattice site is considered adjacent to six sites and cells can replicate only if a neighboring site is empty or if it contains a dead cell. Only uninfected cells are allowed to replicate. When cells on the lattice are initialized all uninfected cells are stochastically assigned a TIME TO DEATH value between 1 and an arbitrary CELL LIFESPAN variable. CELL LIFESPAN was chosen to be large enough such that 5%, a minority of the cells, die naturally within the simulated 24 h. CELL LIFESPAN is not affected by infection as in vitro experimental observations showed no increase in cell death due to infection within 24 h.",

For this reason in our model the initial spatial distribution of uninfected cells affects the overall cell growth on the virtual culture well. In order to obtain a correct cell growth in our model we included a parameter called DIVISION TIME that indicates the time necessary for a single uninfected cell to duplicate given an empty neighboring lattice site. We adjusted DIVISION TIME to match the simulated doubling time with the experimentally derived doubling time by analyzing cell growth of uninfected cells over 48 h as a function of time for different DIVISION TIME values (Fig. 4) .

The contribution to the observed viral titer is mainly due to the production of viral particles released by cells infected in the second round, since the % of infected cells grows from about 2% at 0 h to about 11% after 12 h. This explains the exponential increase in the viral titer measured between 12 and 24 h, considering that the maximum rate of virions release is reached after about 12 h post infection. Fig. 6 (B) demonstrates agreement of solutions identified using simulated annealing and how these solutions compare to the original virus titer curve. Note that the 0 and 4 h time points do not match exactly because our simulation assumes no residual virus at the time of initial infection.",

Fig. 8(A) shows that INFECTIOUSNESS and VIR RELEASE are significant over 24 h of simulated infection and that their correlations start to diverge at \u223c12 h. Again, BINDING PROB and NUM DIFF STEPS do not show a significant correlation with virus titer. However, parameters necessary for the second round of infection do impact the proportion of infected cells shown in Fig. 8(B) where we see an increase in BINDING PROB and VIR RELEASE correlation between 7 and 12 h, corresponding to a decrease in the INFECTIOUSNESS correlation. This decrease can be attributed to the second round of infection in which a greater population of cells has been infected. The simultaneous increase in correlation of BINDING PROB and VIR RELEASE indicates that additional rounds of infection are playing a significant role in viral spread, confirming the results of our SA.",
