The hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene of Breda virus serotype 2 (BRV-2) has been identified and the nucleotide sequence for BRV serotype 1 (BRV-1) genome which contains the open reading frames for the viral structural proteins has been reported revealing the presence of a 1.25 kb gene whose nucleotide sequence is identical to that of the BRV-2 HE gene. In this study, we amplified the 1.2kb HE gene from the HTV genome using long RT-PCR and sequenced the amplicon directly. At the nucleotide level, the HTV HE gene manifests 85% sequence identity to the HE genes of BRV-1 and BRV-2 and 89% identity with the X pseudogene sequence of BEV. The 1.25 kb amplicons which contained the HE genes of BRV-1 and HTV were cloned and expressed in a baculovirus system and the proteins purified by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Hyperimmune sera prepared in guinea pigs against these proteins were reactive with both bovine torovirus (BTV) and human torovirus (HTV) antigens. By immunoblot, they reacted specifically with a 65 kDa protein corresponding in size to the torovirus HE protein. Furthermore, the hyperimmune sera but not the preimmune sera reacted with a series of BTV-positive and HTV-positive fecal specimens by immunoblot and dot blot analysis. By immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) torovirus particles from BTV-positive specimens from calves with diarrhea and HTV-positive specimens from patients were aggregated by the hyperimmune sera. Human convalescent sera and gnotobiotic calf post-infection sera reacted by immunoblot with the expressed 65 kDa protein. The expressed HE protein of HTV has important diagnostic potential. : S 0 1 6 8 -1 7 0 2 ( 9 9 ) 0 0 0 8 8 -X",

They are related to the torovirus prototype Berne virus (BEV) and the newly described porcine torovirus (Kroneman et al., 1998) . BRV was first isolated in 1982 from the stools of neonatal calves with diarrhea in Breda, Iowa, and is now an established infectious agent of cattle (Woode et al., 1982) . Two serotypes of BRV have been recognized by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISA), and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM). BRV-1 represents the original isolate from Iowa, and BRV-2 includes isolates from Ohio and Iowa (Woode et al., 1985) . Toroviruses were first reported as potential human pathogens with the observation of torovirus-like particles in the fecal specimens of children with diarrhea by electron microscopy EM (Beards et al., 1984) . Recently, the morphological, serological, and molecular properties of these particles were elucidated, establishing them as human toroviruses (Duckmanton et al., 1997) . A study on the prevalence of torovirus in a pediatric population showed that this agent is definitively associated with gastroenteritis in children (Jamieson et al., 1998) .",

The coronavirus and BRV HE proteins are 65 kDa class I membrane proteins that share 30-35% amino acid identity with the HE-1 subunit of the HE fusion protein (HEF) of influenza C virus (ICV). However, the fact that the HE genes of coronaviruses and toroviruses are located at different positions in their genomes suggests that these viruses acquired their HE genes through separate heterologous RNA recombination events (Snijder et al., 1991) . Although the origin of the torovirus HE gene is unknown, it has been speculated that coronaviruses captured their HE module from ICV or a related virus during a mixed infection .",

Although, receptor binding and membrane fusion in coronaviruses has been shown to be mediated by the S protein (Cavanagh, 1995) , it has been suggested that the coronavirus HE may serve as an additional membrane-binding protein (Vlasak et al., 1988; Parker et al., 1989) . However, it has been shown from studies on mouse hepatitis virus that infection cannot be mediated by HE alone as it requires the interaction of S with its receptor (Gagneten et al., 1995) . Instead, it has been postulated that the HE protein may play a role in the early stages of infection where it mediates viral adherence to the intestinal wall of the host by specifically yet reversibly binding the mucopolysaccharides in the mucus layer that protects the epithelial cells of the enteric tract. The process of binding 9-O-acetylated receptors, followed by cleavage and rebinding intact receptors, may result in virus migration through the mucus layer, thereby facilitating infection (Cornelissen et al., 1997) .",

(1998b) , the nucleotide sequence of the BRV-1 HE gene was shown to be 77% identical at its 3% end to the X pseudogene of BEV, and 100% identical to the HE gene of BRV-2 (Cornelissen et al., 1997) . In this study we have identified a HE gene homologue in the human torovirus. Sequence analysis revealed that the HTV HE gene is 85% identical to the BRV-1 and BRV-2 HE genes at the nucleotide level and 76% at the amino acid level.. The corresponding 3% end of the human HE gene is 89% identical to the BEV X gene. This is considered a very important finding since we have previously shown that the untranslated 3% end of the human torovirus genome manifests 99% nucleotide sequence identity with BEV in a 219 base region that was sequenced (Duckmanton et al., 1997) . To ensure that this sequence that was reported was derived from the human torovirus, RNA from five virus positive specimens over a 5-year period was amplified by RT-PCR and the amplicons were shown to have the same high level of homology but differed from each other in one to two bases. Likewise, five representative sequences of the same 3% end region of bovine toroviruses were 97% identical to the BRV sequence and 96% identical to the BEV sequence (Duckmanton et al., 1998a) . It is therefore evident that the homology of the torovirus genomes at the 3% end is very high. In contrast, the existence of a complete HE gene in HTV demonstrates it is a distinct virus from BEV which has only the pseudogene X in place of the HE gene. With the sequence information currently available it would be speculative to further comment on the relatedness of HTV to the previously characterized BEV isolate. It is therefore essential that the S gene of HTV be sequenced and expressed since it is the most likely candidate to code for the epitopes involved in virus neutralization.",

These expressed proteins also reacted by immunoblot with the baBRV-1 antiserum and all nine human acute/convalescent paired sera from patients whose stools were diagnosed positive for HTV by EM, and who had been shown to have experienced seroconversion by HI and IEM. This type of cross-reactivity among torovirus species has previously been reported between BRV antigens and BEV antibodies by immunofluorescence microscopy assays (IFA) and ELISA , and human stools documented to contain HTV particles by EM have been shown to be reactive in a torovirus-specific ELISA using BRV antiserum (Koopmans et al., 1993) . Thus, as was shown for the BRV-2 HE protein (Cornelissen et al., 1997) , the HE proteins of BRV-1 and HTV are expressed during natural toroviral infections and the immune response to these is a marker of viral infection. In marked contrast, the expressed nucleocapsid protein of BRV-1 did not react with convalescent human sera from torovirus patients (Duckmanton et al., 1998b) . This could be interpreted as evidence that the nucleocapsid proteins of BRV-1 and HTV are antigenically less closely related and that the overall immune response to the nucleocapsid protein is low and hence only antibodies to the homologous virus can be detected.",

Close examination of electron micrographs of BRV and HTV reveal, in addition to the 7-9 nm peplomer proteins, the presence of shorter 4-6 nm surface projections, resembling those formed by the HE proteins of coronaviruses (Sugiyama and Amano, 1981) .
