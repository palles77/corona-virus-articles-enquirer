The resulting nucleosides were probed for their ability to inhibit tumor cell proliferation, as well as for their activity against a panel of relevant human viruses. While C6-aryl substituted purine nucleosides were found to be weakly active, several C7substituted 7-deazapurine nucleosides elicited potent antiproliferative activity. Their activity spectrum was evaluated in the NCI-60 tumor cell line panel indicating activity against several solid tumor derived cell lines. Analog 32, equipped with a 7-deaza 7-chloro-6-amino-purin-9-yl base was evaluated in a metastatic breast tumor (MDA-MB-231-LM2) xenograft model. It inhibited both tumor growth and reduced the formation of lung metastases as revealed by BLI analysis. The dideazanucleoside analog 66 showed interesting activity against hCMV. These results highlight the potential advantages of recombining known sugar and nucleobase motifs as a library design strategy to discover novel antiviral or antitumor agents.",

In this paper, a rather underrepresented 3 0 -C-ethynylribofuranose motif [15e18] was used as the sugar scaffold to construct a small library of nucleoside analogs. Previous reports mainly focused on pyrimidine (-like) nucleobase moieties [17, 19] , structurally resembling the cytidine analog, ECyd (1, Fig. 1 ), which emerged as the most promising derivative from the initial discovery of 3 0 -C-ethynyl nucleosides in 1996 [15] . ECyd has been evaluated in clinical trials as a new antitumoral agent [3] and recently attracted renewed interest as a combination therapy, e.g. with carboplatin [3] , or as part of a 'duplex drug', in which it is linked to 2 0 -deoxy-5-fluorouridine [20] .",

Switching to the benzoate protected sugar derivative 18 [15] improved the coupling yields [27] , but the isolated glycosylation products were contaminated with residues of glycosyl donor degradation products (tentative assignment based on 1 H NMR data; not shown). Treatment of the crude intermediates 19e22 with NH 3 /MeOH [27] (or NH 4 OH [28] ) at elevated (>100 C) temperatures caused decomposition. Therefore, an alternative protocol to introduce the 6-amino group was employed [29, 30] . Nucleophilic displacement of the 6-chloride with sodium azide efficiently delivered the corresponding azide derivatives (23e26), which generally could be obtained in pure form due to the marked difference in polarity induced by the predominating tetrazolo tautomer. Staudinger reduction furnished the corresponding 6-amino derivatives. Deprotection afforded the final compounds (31, 32, 33, 34) . To dehalogenate the 7-iodo intermediate 26, it was subjected to I/Mg exchange using Knochel's iPrMgCl.LiCl [26, 31] , and the magnesiated intermediate was quenched with aqueous acid to give 35 in good yield. Further conversion to 37 was realized as described above. Introduction of a furan-2-yl moiety was achieved via an aqueous Suzuki reaction on 34 [25] . Remarkably, Suzuki reaction on the 7-iodo-7-deazapurine substrate gave significantly lower yields than reaction with the 6chloropurine starting material.",

The presence of a 3 J H-1 0 -C-8 cross peak in the 1 H-13 C gHMBC spectrum of compound 48 (see Supporting Information) allowed to ascertain glycosylation at N9 (N7). However, a large coupling constant (J \u00bc 37. 8 Hz) observed for C8 (C6) was inconsistent with the CF 3 group being attached to C7 (C5). This led us to assign the structure of the trifluoromethylated compound prepared using Langlois' reagent as the C8 (C6) regio-isomer. The C7 (C5) substituted heterocycle 42 could be obtained from the known C7 (C5) iodide 40 [34] by subsequent N-Boc protection and trifluoromethylation using the Ruppert reagent [37] (the N-Boc protecting group was lost during the reaction). Comparison of the 1 H NMR spectra of both regioisomers 39 and 42 (see Supporting Information) led to the confirmation that 39 and thus also 48, are the C8 (C6) substituted isomers. Of note, a recent patent application [38] described both regio-isomers 39 and 42, in which the regiochemical assignment is opposite to our conclusions. The C7 substituted heterocycle 42 was used to synthetize the desired product 49, following the same reaction sequence as above.",

Their spectrum of activity was thoroughly investigated (except for 49) by assaying against the NCI-60 panel, which also revealed nanomolar activity against several solid tumor derived cell lines. Removal of the N7 nitrogen and introduction of substitutions at C7 (particularly halogens, derivatives 31e34) was shown to lead to significantly more potent antiproliferative nucleosides than the C2/C6 modified derivatives we have previously reported. Additionally, analogs 31e34 potently inhibited proliferation of endothelial cell types, which could be particularly interesting for the treatment of solid tumors. As a proof-of-concept, analog 32 was investigated in a metastatic breast cancer xenograft mouse model. This derivative inhibited both tumor growth as well as metastasis as assessed by means of BLI. However, 32 also potently inhibited in vitro proliferation of Hel-fibroblasts, requiring further optimization to improve on selectivity.

In short; the antiviral assays were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (Hel) fibroblasts. Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of HCMV (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) (VZV). After a 1e2 h, the residual virus was removed, and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity (hCMV) or plaque formation (VZV) was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures (untreated controls). Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 or concentration required for reducing virus-induced cytopathicity or viral plaque formation by 50%.",
