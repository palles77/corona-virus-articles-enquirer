            "text": "Background: The Ebola virus has been responsible for numerous outbreaks since the 1970s, with the most recent outbreak taking place between 2014 and 2016 and causing an international public health emergency. Ebola virus disease (EVD) has a high mortality rate and no approved targeted treatment exists to date. A number of established drugs are being considered as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of EVD. Objective: We aimed to identify potential drug repositioning candidates and to assess the scientific evidence available on their efficacy. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Embase, and other relevant trial registry platforms for studies published between January 1976 and January 2017. We included drug screening, preclinical studies, and clinical studies on repurposed drugs for the treatment of EVD. The risk of bias for animal studies and nonrandomized clinical studies was assessed. The quality of reporting for case series and case reports was evaluated. Finally, we selected drugs approved by established regulatory authorities, which have positive in vitro study outcomes and at least one additional animal or clinical trial. Results: We identified 3301 publications, of which 37 studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of study type, methodology, and intervention. The risk of bias was high for 13 out of 14 animal studies. We selected 11 drugs with potential anti-EVD therapeutic effects and summarized their evidence. Conclusions: Several established drugs may have therapeutic effects on EVD, but the quality and quantity of current scientific evidence is lacking. This review highlights the need for well-designed and conducted preclinical and clinical research to establish the efficacy of potential repurposed drugs against EVD.",

For example, a study from 2002 revealed that in the period between 1975 and 1999, only 13 out of 1393 new, approved drugs were specifically indicated for tropical diseases, accounting for o1% of all new approved drugs. 6 Nonetheless, the recent EVD outbreak led to accelerated de novo drug development efforts for EVD. 7 These efforts were promoted by an expedited approval process by regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency. 8 , 9 Yet, after more than 2 years since the start of the epidemic, results of many experimental drugs are considered either questionable or negative, with only 1 potential vaccine being considered a true breakthrough. 10 To date, none of the experimental drugs has been fully approved for the treatment or prevention of EVD.",

First, repurposed drugs usually have well-known safety and pharmacokinetic profiles, which leads to shorter development cycles and lower costs. 12 In addition, these drugs may often tap into an already established manufacturing and distribution network, which shortens production and delivery times in cases of rapidly spreading epidemics. Finally, depending on which repurposed drugs are being identified, they may already be marketed as generics, which is a clear advantage in countries with resourcepoor health care systems.",

            "text": "Chloroquine is a readily available, well-tolerated antimalarial agent with a long history of use in the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria. It also has well documented antiviral effects at various stages of a viral life cycle, including anti-HIV-1 activity 61 as well as inhibitory effects on the severe acute respiratory virus syndrome coronavirus. 62 In addition, studies show systemic antiinflammatory effects of chloroquine by downregulating the production of proinflammatory factors such as interferon (IFN)-\u00f6\u030aand tumor necrosis factor-\u00f6. 63 The potential activity of chloroquine on the Ebola virus may be achieved by inhibiting virus entry into host cells. This is believed to take place by inhibiting various factors such as vesicle sorting and endosome-membrane fusion, as well as increasing endosomal pH. 27 Chloroquine was shown to successfully inhibit the Ebola virus in vitro in different studies and with various cell lines. 27, 36, 39, 46 Animal studies, on the other hand, revealed mixed results. In 2013, Madrid et al 27 carried out an animal trial in which 8 out of 10 mice survived Ebola infection when treated with chloroquine twice daily at 90 mg/kg IP. In another study, intraperitoneal treatment with chloroquine at the same dose showed no significant protection and high toxicity in a mouse and hamster model. 46 In 2015, Madrid et al 48 were able to reproduce positive results upon repeat testing of chloroquine on Ebola-infected mice under identical conditions (90 mg/kg IP twice daily). Chloroquine administered orally at 40 mg/kg once daily showed no increase in survival. 48 Our search did not yield any clinical trials for chloroquine. Activity involves enhancing host defenses (eg, by activating macrophages into a M1-phenotype, which is antiviral and proinflammatory) Mice: IFN-\u00f6\u030aadministered 24 h before or after infection significantly reduced mortality of lethally-challenged mice and reduced morbidity Monkeys: IFN-\u00f62b treated monkeys showed slight delay of death and delay of development of viremia, none survived. In a different study, IFN-\u00f6\u0307prolonged survival but did not change mortality Convalescent blood Donation and use of human blood products is approved and applied worldwide. Indications include anemia Monkeys: No improved survival for rhesus macaques treated with convalescent serum from macaque convalescent sera Inhibition via EBOV neutralizing antibodies present in convalescent plasma Humans: In 2 nonrandomized comparative/controlled studies, treatment of patients with up to 500 mL convalescent plasma or whole blood did not significantly improve survival Other studies include 1 case report (1 patient, survived) and 1 observational study (9 patients; 87.5% survival). An additional case report describes use of convalescent serum as well as favipiravir Azithromycin Antibiotic approved for treatment of many bacterial infections The mixed results provided by animal studies may be explained by the range of doses tested. With an EC 50 of 16 \u00f6\u00a5M, higher doses may be necessary to produce consistently positive results. This may lead to poor outcome due to an increase in drug related toxicity. Furthermore, chloroquine may be more effective if given prophylactically due to its activity during the early stages of a viral cycle. Hence, additional animal studies for dose finding are recommendable before clinical trials.",

They are currently approved for the treatment of hepatitis C 64 as well as certain autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis. 65 During recent viral outbreaks, IFNs have been suggested as a potential treatment for emerging viral infections, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. 66 The antiviral activity of IFNs appears to occur via the induction of IFNs-induced transmembrane proteins, which inhibit a broad range of viruses at different stages of the virus life cycle, including viral entry and fusion. 67, 68 The potential use of IFNs in the treatment of EVD has been assessed by several studies since the 1990s. 34, 41, 45, 47 In vitro studies have shown potent inhibition of EVD across multiple cell types. In 1 animal study, IFN-\u00f6\u030awas shown to protect mice challenged with a lethal dose of Ebola virus. 45 Two additional studies involving nonhuman primates treated with IFN-\u00f6\u0307or IFN-\u00f62b revealed an increase in survival time but no change in mortality. 41, 45 Despite a potential increase in the availability of IFNs as therapeutic agents, 69 there are several concerns on the practicality of its use during an EVD outbreak. Certain side effects of IFN such as fever and myalgia may be difficult to control in an EVD treatment unit. In addition, it is important to rule out comorbidity with malaria before an interferon treatment, which may be difficult to achieve and may further delay treatment.",

In the case of infectious diseases, there are several reports on the off-label use of convalescent blood products. 70, 71 We chose to include convalescent blood products in our assessment due to the similar properties shared with repurposed therapeutics. These include their presumed availability in the setting of an EVD epidemic, positive reports on tolerability, and the absence of safety-related events in 2 nonrandomized studies. 57, 59 Nonetheless, it is important to note that transfusion-transmitted infections remain a significant problem in Africa, and it may be difficult to distinguish between transfusion-related complications and EVD progression. 72, 73 The use of whole blood as a form of passive immunotherapy for the treatment of EVD was reported during the EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1995. 55 In the observational study, 7 out of 8 patients who received convalescent blood transfusion survived, in contrast to an 80% mortality rate during that outbreak. However, all 7 survivors received convalescent blood between Day 7 and Day 15 after the onset of symptoms. In a separate analysis, it was shown that the high rate of survival was due to the treatment of patients later in the course of disease, when they have a higher probability of survival. 74 During the recent West Africa EVD outbreak, the World Health Organization approved the use of blood or plasma transfusions from convalescent patients. 75 Our search yielded 3 single case reports of foreign patients who contracted EVD during their stay in western Africa and survived following transfusion therapy. [52] [53] [54] An additional potential therapeutic agent was administered in 2 cases. 52, 54 The largest study on the treatment of EVD with convalescent blood enrolled 102 confirmed EVD patients in a M\u00fbdecins Sans Fronti\u00fb\u0155es-led treatment unit in Guinea, of whom 84 were included in the primary analysis. 57 The study showed no significant improvement in survival for patients receiving up to 500 mL convalescent plasma with unknown levels of neutralizing antibodies, even after adjusting for age and cycle-threshold value. A recently published study from Sierra Leone 59 similarly did not show a significant improvement in survival, but revealed a significant drop in viral load after 24 hours of treatment with convalescent whole blood. Furthermore, results from a recent animal study by Mire et al 50 did not show protection by the treatment of rhesus monkeys with convalescent sera. It remains unknown whether convalescent blood products with known titers of anti-Ebola virus antibodies, alternative administration regimens, or a subselection of patients would yield different results.",

Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor used in the treatment of depression. Bepridil is a calcium channel blocker once used to treat angina pectoris. Both drugs were found to effectively inhibit Ebola virus in vitro by more than 90%. 25 In a murine model, 7 out of 10 mice treated with 10 mg/kg sertraline twice daily survived, compared with 100% mortality in the control group.

It is considered to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity against RNA viruses and has demonstrated activity against hemorrhagic fevercausing viruses, such as the arenaviruses and bunyaviruses. 78, 79 To unfold its antiviral activity, favipiravir is initially converted to its active metabolite, which acts as an RNA polymerase inhibitor, mainly via direct competition with guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP). In addition, favipiravir causes lethal mutagenesis after being incorporated into the viral RNA. 80 Studies on the Ebola virus involving favipiravir have shown promising outcomes in vitro and in small animal trials. 40, 42, 43 In 2 animal studies with different mice models and treatment regimens, treatment with favipiravir was associated with a 100% survival rate. 42, 43 However, the outcome of a Phase II clinical trial was not as clear. 51 In the nonrandomized, cohort study, patients were stratified based on their baseline cycle threshold value, reflecting their viral load. Only patients with moderate to high viremia (cycle threshold value Z 20) showed a tendency for a lower mortality rate compared with historical records, although the difference was not statistically significant. 51 In a single-center retrospective study by Bai et al, 58 a series of 39 treated patients with medium to high viral load showed a significantly higher survival rate compared with the control group. Additional randomized, multicenter trials are necessary to confirm efficacy in target groups and to eliminate confounding variables.",

            "text": "This systematic review was carried out on the basis of a previously published protocol to comprehensively search and select relevant studies and to identify potential repurposed drugs for EVD. However, limitations that are either inherent to the methodology applied in this review or to the studies included still exist. First, despite a search strategy that was designed to be highly sensitive, we cannot be certain that all studies on this topic have been captured. This is due to the pressing nature of an acute EVD epidemic, which resulted in a rapidly evolving research scene, with many studies currently underway. 82 Second, this review was synthesized narratively, which may increase the risk of bias if 1 study is given more weight compared with others. 83 Efforts to avoid such bias in this review include systematic selection of articles, extraction of data, and identification of potential drugs by 2 authors independently. Multireviewer extraction has been previously shown to decrease the risk of error compared with singlereviewer extraction. 84 There are several limitations inherent to the studies included in this review. First, a clear majority of included studies were categorized as screening, in vitro, or animal studies. Results from these studies cannot be used to reliably predict a positive response in humans. 85, 86 In our review, only 3 studies were carried out on nonhuman primates, which are considered the gold standard for filovirus models because they resemble the human clinical manifestation of filoviral disease. 87 The remaining 11 animal studies were carried out using adapted small animal models, such as mice, hamsters, and guinea pigs, which are not naturally susceptible to the Ebola virus. In these studies, it was necessary to use a genetically adapted virus that has undergone numerous mutations to achieve virulence and lethality. The genetic variation of an adapted Ebola virus together with differences in disease development compared with infected humans limit our ability to extrapolate results from these studies. Furthermore, our risk of bias assessment revealed a high risk of bias for 13 out of 14 animal studies. This limitation appears to be a shared concern amongst other fields of drug development. 88 Our review included a total of 9 clinical studies that did not have a high level of internal validity or a high level of evidence. Based on the Oxford 2011 levels of evidence, 89 4 out of 9 studies are case reports or case series with a low level of evidence, 52-55 and 5 trials are nonrandomized studies with a midrange level of evidence. 51,56-59 This lack of high-level evidence may have several reasons. First, until the recent EVD epidemic, this condition has been neglected and no major clinical research attempts were carried out. Second, clinical research during an outbreak faces many ethical and practical obstacles that influence study design, the number of participants, and settings. 90, 91 Conclusions This systematic review offers a comprehensive overview on the current state of the art with regard to drug repurposing for EVD. It addresses the different stages of repurposed drug development for EVD, from screening chemical libraries to clinical trials. Authors of the review identified 11 therapeutic agents with potentially promising therapeutic influence on EVD. At this stage, none of these therapeutic agents can be recommended for the treatment of EVD. This review highlights the need for well-designed and wellconducted preclinical and clinical research to establish the efficacy of these drugs in the proposed indication. It may be a useful aid for researchers to identify gaps in the evidence on the various drugs presented.",
