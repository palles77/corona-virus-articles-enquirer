Major infl uenza epidemics show neither periodicity nor a predictable pattern, and all differ from one another. Evidence suggests that true pandemics involving changes in hemagglutinin subtypes are caused by genetic reassortment in animal infl uenza A viruses. Since 2003, the World Health Organization has reported the infection of \u2248218 persons and 124 deaths (56.9%; as of May 23, 2006) caused by the (H5N1) subtype in 10 different countries; a probable person-to-person transmission of the avian infl uenza virus was suggested (2) . Most countries predicted death rates of 14-1,685 persons per 100,000 population in the event of a pandemic and estimated that up to 2,707 persons per 100,000 population would become infected (3).",

The test consists of 2 individual amplifi cation reactions. In the fi rst step, a generic infl uenza PCR is performed. The specifi city of this reaction was demonstrated for all subtypes of infl uenza A (H1-H15, N1-N9) and all subtypes of infl uenza B. Samples with a positive test result in the fi rst PCR were analyzed in a second PCR with infl uenza (H5N1)-specifi c primers and probes.

Virion integrity in this preparation was confi rmed by electron microscopy. The viral RNA concentration was determined in an external laboratory by multiple quantitative real-time PCR determinations (7) . Different dilutions of the external infl uenza (H5N1) subtype quantifi cation standard (0.0, 0.91, 1.96, 3.91, 7.81, 15.63, 31.25, 62.5, 125, and 250 PFU/mL) were prepared, and 100 \u03bcL of each dilution was spiked into 9.5-mL negative plasma pools.

As with other viruses, a viremic phase of infection can be assumed to precede clinical symptoms such as fever (13, 14) . Recently Chutinimitkul et al. (15) detected infl uenza (H5N1) virus (3,080 copies/mL) in the plasma of a 5-year-old boy, which indicates a viremic phase of infl uenza (H5N1) infection. Those donors may be infective, especially to immunosuppressed patients. In addition to quarantine of infected patients, treatment with antiviral drugs, and development of avian infl uenza vaccines, blood donors should be tested during a pandemic to avoid transfusion-transmitted infections. Our study demonstrates that NAT screening could be incorporated into blood testing without delay and that the infl uenza virus could be suffi ciently enriched by centrifugation. Sensitivity of our infl uenza-screening method would have been suffi cient to detect recently reported virus concentrations in plasma of infected persons (15) . However, as with all minipool methods, infections can be transmitted to transfusion recipients on rare occasions because the viremia level in the donor is below the analytical sensitivity of the screening assay.",

At the German Red Cross, look-back examinations showed only 1 transfusion had transmitted HIV-1 (1998) after the introduction of NAT testing. Blood donor screening by NAT was made technically and fi nancially feasible by creating minipools of up to 96 individual samples per pool.

In the absence of an infective donor, different concentrations of the new infl uenza genotype H5N1 were spiked into minipools of 95 samples. As shown in",
