From the epidemiological point of view, the main indicators generally used to describe the severity of these infection events in livestock are: ( i ) the total number of infected animals and farms during an epidemic, and ( ii ) the duration of the epidemic. The rationale behind these indicators is based on the evidence that epidemic surveillance and control costs are directly related to spatial and temporal extension of the epidemic events [6] . Furthermore, the effect of the epidemic duration on the socio-economic burdens associated to livestock diseases is larger than in human diseases. This is due to the sanitary restrictions imposed to farms in infected areas during ongoing outbreaks, such as animal movement and export bans.

[12] showed that the increase of the epidemic duration affects the sanitary costs associated to disease outbreaks more than a proportional growth in the number of infected farms. This prediction followed from the observation that longer epidemics are more widespread, involving a larger number of animals slaughtered. The estimate of the epidemic duration appears almost invariably in the simulation outputs of data-driven mathematical models developed to evaluate the effectiveness and the efficiency of surveillance and control policies for several infections in livestock, such as foot-andmouth disease [13] , classical swine fever [14] , bovine tuberculosis [15] , and avian influenza [16] . However, few attempts have been made to address the problem of minimizing the epidemic duration from a theoretical point of view by using optimal control theory. To our knowledge, the only example of analytic characterization of the control function in a time-optimal framework is due to Jiang [17] , who focused on the analysis of isolation strategies in a subsystem of the model proposed in Zhang et al. [18] to describe SARS spread. On the other hand, the optimal control theory has been widely applied to solve the problem of minimizing the total number of infected individuals (or the total infectious burden) in basic SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) epidemic models by means of different control policies, such as: the implementation of emergency prophylactic vaccination plans, the isolation of infected individuals, the reduction of disease transmission through the limitation of contacts between individuals, and non-selective culling [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .",

Isolation consists in the quarantine of infected individuals. As regards livestock diseases, in SIR models isolation is mathematically equivalent to removal of infected individuals through testand-cull procedures. Non-selective culling consists in the slaughtering of both infected and healthy individuals and it is usually implemented in wildlife and livestock when no other options are available (e.g. no diagnostic tests available, lack of time or resources). The rationale for culling healthy individuals resides in the positive relationship between the rate at which individuals become infected and the abundance of susceptible individuals. Among humans, the reduction of transmission can be obtained through information campaigns or emergency movement bans (e.g. school closures, flight limitations), while in livestock it can be obtained by imposing limitations on animal, vehicle, and personnel movements among farms.",

Specifically, we characterized analytically the time-optimal control strategies for prophylactic vaccination, isolation, non-selective culling, and reduction of transmission by using a family of simple SIR models in an optimal control framework [26] . Our analyses led to the nontrivial result that, even in the unconstrained optimal control problem (i.e. without costs of control or resource limitations), using the maximal effort for the entire epidemic period may not be the optimal strategy to minimize the epidemic duration. In addition, we found that, when applying the maximal effort for the entire epidemic is sub-optimal, then a delayed control represents the optimal strategy in all the cases investigated. We even found that the optimal amount of delay applied to the control may be sufficiently large to postpone the beginning of the intervention after the peak of the infection (see Fig. 1 and dark gray regions in Figs. 3 (a), 4 (a) , and 5 (a)). In addition, we showed that the delayed control may represent the optimal strategy for minimizing the epidemic duration even when a prompt intervention could immediately reduce the number of infected individuals (i.e. reduce R C below 1, see Figs. 3 (c) and 5 (c)).",

Two evidences support this explanation: (1) delayed control is generally optimal when the effectiveness of the control is low (i.e. low u max ); and (2) isolation and reduction of transmission policies (which do not reduce directly the number of susceptibles) tend to select for delayed control in wider ranges of parameter settings than vaccination and culling.",

In particular, Figs. 3 (c) and 5 (c) display the eradication time, T , and Figs. 3 (d) and 5 (d) display the number of susceptible individuals at the end of the epidemic, S ( T ), as functions of u max for both the timeoptimal control and the constant control (corresponding to the optimal solution for the unconstrained problem of infectious burden minimization). From these figures, we notice that the differ-ent objective functions provide similar results when the control effort s are sufficiently large to rapidly lead the epidemic to extinction (high u max ), while they provide substantially different results in the case of less efficient strategies (low u max ). Specifically, the time-optimal control strategy performs poorly in minimizing the infectious burden at the boundary between delayed and constant control (see Figs. 3 (d) and 5 (d)), while the infectious burden minimization strategy performs poorly in minimizing the epidemic duration for slightly higher values of R C (see the peak of T \u03c4 =0 in Figs. 3 (c) and 5 (c) ).",

Among other scenarios, they compared the effect of suppressive vaccination strategies started at 7 and 14 days after the outbreak beginning. They found that, in two out of the four models investigated, the medians and/or the 95 th percentiles of the epidemic duration decreased when the control is delayed by 7 days [ 13 , see models 'IS+' and 'NL' in table 4 therein]. On the other hand, they found that the number of infected farms always increases when the vaccination is delayed [see table 4 in 13 ] . In a similar way, by investigating the effectiveness of combined culling and movement restriction to control classical swine fever in Switzerland pig farms, D\u00fcrr et al.

This is in contradiction with Theorem 1 , as the adjoint variables \u03bb S and \u03bb I cannot vanish simultaneously by construction, therefore \u03c8 vanishes only in isolated points. As a consequence, the control is a piecewise constant function u l ( t ) that can assume only two values: 0 and u max . The switching times are defined as the time instants at which the function \u03c8( t ) changes its sign and, consequently, the function u l ( t ) changes its value. Therefore two types of switch can occur: either the value of u l ( t ) is 0 in a left-neighborhood of the switching time and is u max in a right-neighborhood, and we denote it by 0 \u2192 u max , or the converse, which is denoted by u max \u2192 0.",

Since Q is a decreasing function, this means that Q is positive in the interval of the function \u03c8 after the peak is then from negative to positive, which is not admissible, since we proved that \u03c8 is negative in a left-neighborhood of T . Thus the switch can only occur before the peak and, being \u02d9 \u03c8 (\u03c4 s ) always negative, it must be unique.

The sign of the function \u03c8 in the leftneighborhood of T will then be determined by the sign of \u03bb I ( T ). Substituting \u03bb S (T ) = 0 in (B.1) and by condition 2 of Theorem 1 we get \u03bb I (T ) = \u2212\u02d9 I (T ) \u22121 , which is positive, since \u02d9 I (T ) < 0 .

We still prove that there can be at most one switching time, relevant to the switch 0 \u2192 u max and that, in addition, the switch can only occur before the peak time. Let \u03c4 s be a generic switching time, namely \u03c8 (\u03c4 s ) = 0 .

In fact, it vanishes at \u03c4 s (since \u03c8 (\u03c4 s ) = 0 ) and at T (for the transversality condition) and it is strictly positive between the two points, since \u03c8 < 0. On the interval [ \u03c4 s , T ], being u (t) = u max v , \u03bb S is a C 1 function, therefore its maximum and minimum points are characterized by \u02d9 \u03bb S = 0 , namely \u03bb S = \u03b2I\u03bb I / (\u03b2I + u max v ) from (B.3) . Substituting this value in (B.1) and recalling that H = 0 we obtain that in the extremal points \u03bb I = 1 / (\u03bcI) . Substituting those values in the second derivative of \u03bb S we obtain:\u03bb S = \u03bb S [(\u03b2I + u max v ) 2 \u2212 \u03bc\u03b2I] \u2212 \u03bb I \u03b2I(\u03b2I + u max v ) = \u2212 \u03b2 2 I/ (\u03b2I + u max v ), which is negative and therefore in the interval ( \u03c4 s , T ) the function \u03bb S has a unique maximum point, which we denote by M \u03bb S . More-over \u03bb S (M \u03bb S ) = \u03b2I(M \u03bb S ) \u03bb I (M \u03bb S ) / (\u03b2I(M \u03bb S ) + u max v ) < \u03bb I (M \u03bb S ) . (m \u03c8 ) = (\u03b2I(m \u03c8 ) + u max v ) \u03bb S (m \u03c8 ) > 0 , therefore m \u03c8 < M \u03bb S . Being \u03bb I ( m \u03c8 ) < \u03bb S ( m \u03c8 ) and \u03bb I (M \u03bb S ) > \u03bb S (M \u03bb S ) , there must exist a point \u03c3 \u2208 (m \u03c8 , M \u03bb S ) such that \u03bb S (\u03c3 ) = \u03bb I (\u03c3 ) and \u02d9 \u03bb I (\u03c3 ) > \u02d9 \u03bb S (\u03c3 ) , as sketched inFig. B.6. This last inequality reduces to \u03bc\u03bb I (\u03c3 ) > u max v \u03bb S (\u03c3 ) , therefore \u03bc > u max v is a necessary condition for having a positive switching time. In conclusion, if u max v > \u03bc the optimal control is the constant controlu v (t) \u2261 u max v .B3. Proof for optimal reduction of transmission policyLet x (t) = (S(t ) , I(t )) T denote the optimal solution for the reduction of the transmission control problem, with control term u r ( t ), \u03bb(t) = (\u03bb S (t ) , \u03bb I (t )) T the corresponding adjoint variables and T the optimal eradication time. By the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, the Hamiltonian function, the switching function and its derivative are respectively:H(x , \u03bb, u r ) = 1 + (\u03bb I \u2212 \u03bb S ) \u03b2(1 \u2212 u r ) SI \u2212 \u03bcI\u03bb I (B.4) \u03c8 (x , \u03bb) = (\u03bb S \u2212 \u03bb I ) \u03b2SI, \u02d9 \u03c8 (x , \u03bb) = \u2212\u03bc\u03b2SI\u03bb S , (B.5)and the adjoint variables satisfy the following system of ODEs:\u02d9 \u03bb S = (\u03bb S \u2212 \u03bb I ) \u03b2(1 \u2212 u r ) I \u02d9 \u03bb I = (\u03bb S \u2212 \u03bb I ) \u03b2(1 \u2212 u r ) S + \u03bc\u03bb I .For the proof of Theorem 5 , first we show that the control is non-singular, namely that the function \u03c8 vanishes only in isolated points. Suppose that \u03c8 vanishes in an open interval B . Then \u03c8 = \u02d9 \u03c8 = 0 in B , namely \u03bb S = \u03bb I = 0 (see (B.5) ), which is in contradiction with the statement of the Theorem 1 . Therefore, \u03c8 can vanish only in isolated points. Substituting \u03bb S (T ) = 0 (the transversality condition) in (B.4) and by condition 2 of Theorem 1 we get \u03bb I (T ) = \u2212\u02d9 I (T ) \u22121 , which is positive, being \u02d9 I (T ) < 0 . As a consequence, \u03c8( T ) < 0 by (B.5) .",
