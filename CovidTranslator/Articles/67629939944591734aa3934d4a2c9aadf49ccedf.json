In recent years, however, global health issues have risen to the highest levels of international politics and have become accepted as legitimate issues in foreign policy. This elevated political priority is in many ways a welcome development for proponents of global health, and it has resulted in increased funding for and attention to select global health issues. However, there has been less examination of the tensions that characterize the relationship between global health and foreign policy and of the potential effects of linking global health efforts with the foreign-policy interests of states. In this paper, the authors review the relationship between global health and foreign policy by examining the roles of health across 4 major components of foreign policy: aid, trade, diplomacy, and national security. For each of these aspects of foreign policy, the authors review current and historical issues and discuss how foreign-policy interests have aided or impeded global health efforts. The increasing relevance of global health to foreign policy holds both opportunities and dangers for global efforts to improve health.",

From sanitary cordons instituted to prevent plague from entering Croatia's Dalmatian Coast to the international sanitary conventions, which began in 1851, to the victories over malaria and yellow fever that permitted the construction of the strategic Panama Canal, health and disease have been intertwined with the pursuit of foreignpolicy interests. However, over the last 2 decades, globalization has made global health more relevant across multiple aspects of foreign policy than ever before. Fidler calls this a ''revolution'' in the political status of global health, noting that ''nothing in the prior history of national and international efforts on public health compares to the political status public health has reached today'' (1, p. 45) .",

The first interpretation argues that global health is an important objective of foreign policy in itself, and that ''health has become a preeminent political value for 21st century humanity'' (2, p. 183 ). This perspective concludes that global health can transform the state interests that have historically defined foreign policy. Echoing this position, Kickbusch et al. write that ''foreign policy is now being driven substantially by health'' (3, p. 971) , and Horton suggests that health can move ''foreign policy away from a debate about interests to one about global altruism'' (4, p. 807 ).",

Far from being transformational, global health is simply another issue that foreign-policy-makers weigh against other state interests. This perspective, based on the realist theory of international relations, explains the recent political prominence of global health as a result of the growing impact of disease upon traditional security concerns: ''When diseases threaten, or show the potential to threaten, national security, military capabilities, geopolitical or regional stability, national populations, economic power, and trade interests, foreign policy makers take notice'' (2, p. 184 ).",

An understanding of the relationship between global health and foreign policy benefits from examining papers across a broad range of public health, political science, and international relations literature and from incorporating case studies of interactions between global health and foreign policy that are difficult to target with search strategies. We conducted searches in numerous databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Social Science Citation Index, JSTOR, EconLit, and Science Direct), selecting articles that either directly addressed the relationship between global health and foreign policy or were case studies of an interaction between global health and 1 or more of the 4 dimensions of foreign policy. Thus, this paper is not a comprehensive assessment of every published article related to this subject; rather, we seek to provide a review of key existing literature that illuminates the relationship and tensions between global health and the aid, trade, diplomacy, and national security aspects of foreign policy.",

Kennedy created the US Agency for International Development, he explicitly acknowledged the US security interest in providing aid to ward off the collapse of developing-country governments, which ''would be disastrous to our national security, harmful to our comparative prosperity, and offensive to our conscience'' (8) .

Since the end of World War II, large donor states have tended to focus bilateral and multilateral aid to support countries judged to be strategically linked to national security and economic interests (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . The basic institutional architecture for multilateral development aid-the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the United Nations, along with specialized United Nations agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO)-were created after World War II with the immediate goal of rebuilding and modernizing war-damaged societies and safeguarding the security of Western powers (19) . Between the 1960s and the 1980s, aid from the United States and other Western countries ''reflected anti-communist Cold War tensions'' and focused on ''containing Soviet influence in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa'' (20, p. 2) . Promises of substantial US aid packages to Egypt and Israel facilitated their signing of the 1978 Camp David peace agreement, and since 1978 these 2 countries have ranked at the top of the list of recipients of US foreign assistance (21, 22) . The top 6 recipients of US aid in 2008 were (in descending order) Israel, Afghanistan, Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, and Iraq, indicating a clear preference for aiding strategically important partners instead of the poorest states (20) .",

This represents a change from previous decades, which were characterized by low, stagnant levels of health assistance (26) . This increasing volume of aid comes from and is funneled through an ever more complex set of actors: In a 2008 article, McColl (27) estimated that there are more than 40 bilateral donors, 26 United Nations agencies, 20 global and regional funding mechanisms, and 90 distinct initiatives involved in development assistance for health.",

This trend is likely to continue: The Obama administration's proposed global health budget dedicates fully 70% of US official development assistance for health to HIV/ AIDS (31) . It is worth noting that while the growth in US development assistance for health increased an impressive 208% between 2001 and 2007, it was eclipsed by the growth in aid for government/civil society/democratization efforts (often highly linked to foreign-policy objectives), which grew 260% during the same period (32) .",

In some cases, development assistance for health has been clearly and directly linked to national security. Since 2001, many donors have supported ''health security'' aid to reduce the threat of natural and intentional outbreaks of infectious diseases (35) (36) (37) . For example, aid for international influenza surveillance and pandemic planning and response programs was virtually nonexistent prior to the emergence the H5N1 avian influenza virus, but with the growing perception that an influenza pandemic presents a direct security threat (38) , more than $2 billion was provided to combat the disease between 2004 and 2008 (39) .",

This makes development assistance for health that is guided more by donor interests than by scientific evidence or the priorities of recipients a concern for global health proponents (45) . While there is some evidence of increasing correlation between development assistance and recipient countries' overall burdens of disease (25) , multiple studies demonstrate a continuing and significant disconnect between aid and the burden of health conditions, including maternal mortality (46) and malaria (47) , and the disability-adjusted life years measure (48) . However, even in cases where development assistance for health has been driven primarily by narrow foreign-policy concerns, health benefits can be realized; for example, US health aid for Egypt, an integral part of US Middle East policy, has helped the country achieve dramatic declines in child mortality (49) . Thus, foreign policy's powerful influence on development assistance for health leaves many pressing global health battles underresourced but allows global health efforts that do align with foreignpolicy interests to receive significant political support and funding.",

Given concerns that patent-protected drugs would be too expensive for the world's poor, the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (known as the Doha Declaration) affirmed in 2001 the right of World Trade Organization member states to interpret and implement TRIPS in a manner that supports public health and, in particular, access to medicines (as permitted under GATT Article XX[b]) (56) . A clarification in 2003 specified when countries can import drugs produced elsewhere under a mechanism known as ''compulsory licensing'' (57) . Despite the World Trade Organization's claim that the Doha Declaration removed the ''final patent obstacle to cheap drug imports'' (58, p. 1), the limited capacity of developing states to actually implement the available flexibilities, especially given the stricter protections found in many bilateral and regional trade agreements (known as ''TRIPS\u00fe'' measures), demonstrates the power of economic interests over public health considerations (59) . The WHO has convened an Intergovernmental Working Group on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property Rights to seek an international agreement to balance innovation and access to medicines, but agreement has remained elusive and negotiations continue (60, 61) .",

Both, along with GATT Article XX(b), are concerned with preventing the spread of foodborne diseases while minimizing the required restrictions on trade, but application of restrictions is often controversial (71) . For example, the appropriateness of trade restrictions on beef from countries affected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, on the grounds of protecting public health has been subject to ongoing dispute (72) . Similar disputes over the public health risks of trade in poultry products (H5N1), apples (due to fire blight), and genetically modified organisms have highlighted the ongoing tensions between promoting trade and protecting health (73) .",

Actions taken by certain countries during the SARS epidemic, especially China's attempts to conceal disease information, precipitated these new WHO powers to overcome selfish state interests. Despite this apparent victory of global health over narrow state interests, a number of countries and commentators have argued that the IHRs actually undervalue ''equity between developed and developing nations'' (86, p. 482 ) and risk fragmentation of poor countries' health systems and ''national health priorities set up by developing countries'' (87, p. 13) . These objections center on the IHRs' primary focus on disease surveillance, which some argue may be of greater importance to wealthy countries seeking protection from new epidemics than for poor countries with large existing disease burdens (87) . Thus, ''the WHO's authority in infectious disease control has been strengthened partly because it suited the interests of Western states to allow this to happen'' (88, p. 308) . Whether the IHRs primarily benefit wealthy states seeking to avoid epidemics or can also address burdens of disease in poorer countries will depend upon the nature of future efforts to build surveillance and response capacity in support of the IHRs.",

Approved by the World Health Assembly in 2003, the FCTC represents the WHO's first-ever use of its authority to create a global health treaty to ''reduce the growth and spread of the global tobacco epidemic'' (89, p. 936) . Unlike the IHRs, negotiation of the FCTC could not rely on the high political priority of such efforts. The WHO's Tobacco Free Initiative group gathered the extensive evidence that linked smoking to lung cancer, as well as studies on the negative economic impact caused by tobacco, which framed the treaty in terms of the economic self-interests of states (90) . The WHO also highlighted proven interventions that reduce tobacco consumption and formed a fruitful partnership with an effective coalition of nongovernmental organizations called the Framework Convention Alliance (91) .",

Assunta and Chapman conclude that the ''flexibility in the FCTC language offers an ostensible excuse for. . . parties to the Convention to avoid development of robust comprehensive tobacco control policies'' (92, p. 755 ). There is also significant evidence that transnational tobacco companies sought to undermine the negotiations leading to the FCTC (93) . Finally ratified in 2005, the FCTC sets out broad obligations for reducing both tobacco demand and tobacco production, but the weakened language of the treaty, continuing opposition from transnational tobacco companies (94) , and different levels of commitment mean that enactment of FCTC measures is still highly variable across signatory countries.",

The Oslo Ministerial Declaration, advanced by the ministers of foreign affairs of Brazil, France, Indonesia, Norway, Senegal, South Africa, and Thailand in 2006, declares that ''health as a foreign policy issue needs a stronger strategic focus on the international agenda'' and that these countries have agreed ''to make health a point of departure and a defining lens that each of our countries will use to examine key elements of foreign policy and development strategies'' (95, p. 1373; 96) . Supporting this effort, the Director General of the WHO writes that ''we need to embed the use of the health lens in foreign policy while we have this chance'' but warns that this relationship requires ''careful management for mutual benefit'' (97, p. 498 ). The United Kingdom and Switzerland have enacted national strategies attempting to establish ''policy coherence'' between their global health and foreign policies (3, p. 971). A number of middle-income countries, including Brazil (98), Thailand (99) , and Indonesia (86), also highlight global health in their diplomacy. Finally, Kaufmann and Feldbaum (100) note how diplomacy can be an essential tool for resolving global health crises of political origins, such as the 2003-2004 Nigerian boycott of poliomyelitis vaccine.",

One prominent example is the hospital ship tours of the US Naval Ships Mercy and Comfort, in which these US military assets deliver health, disaster, and humanitarian assistance to underserved countries. These missions work to improve health but are also driven by training needs and the intent to ''win hearts and minds through the use of health interventions'' (101, p. 3) . Broader US investments in global health are also justified by foreign-policy interests; as a former US Senator stated, ''You do not go to war with someone who has saved the life of your child'' (42, p. 219). The United States is not alone in using health interventions to serve foreign-policy objectives; the Cuban health diplomacy program (102) and Chinese health cooperation in Africa (103) are other relevant examples. Other related attempts that utilize health as diplomatic outreach have been termed vaccine (104), science (105, 106) , and disaster (107, 108) diplomacy. Such efforts have not been without criticism. Ingram observes that such efforts may ultimately be ''self-defeating,'' as ''it is precisely the fact that health professionals are not associated with the policies of states that gives them wider credibility'' (109, p. 534) .",

Resistance to broadening the definition of national security to include public health or environmental issues has also been apparent.

McInnes and Lee argue that the national security agenda on health has been narrowly framed and ''dominated by the concerns of foreign and security policy, not of global public health'' (33, p. 22) , while Feldbaum et al. caution that the ''global and humanitarian objectives of the health field do not fit readily into the state-centered perspective of national security'' (127, p. 196 ). The costs of framing international cooperation on epidemic diseases in security terms are also becoming apparent. ''Developing countries are increasingly suspicious of global health initiatives justified on the grounds of 'global health security' '' (128, p. 372) because ''the harvest of outbreak intelligence overseas is essentially geared to benefit wealthy nations'' (87, p. 19) . Controversy over sharing of H5N1 influenza A viral samples (86, 129) and within negotiations over the IHRs (87) are examples of developing countries' resistance to the concept of global health security.",

This linkage, which generated attention from the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly, raised the political priority of HIV/AIDS, which contributed to efforts to establish the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and increased the amount of development assistance for health on global AIDS, particularly in the United States (130, 131) . However, much of the evidence used to frame the disease as a national security threat, including evidence on the prevalence of HIV among African militaries (132, 133) and its potential to cause instability in ''next wave'' states (134, p. 4; 135) , has been shown to be inaccurate (136) (137) (138) (139) (140) . Furthermore, linkage of the disease to national security agendas may have contributed to the possibly disproportionate focus on the pandemic in national aid budgets (141) and has been criticized (142) for its potential to push response to the disease ''away from civil society toward state institutions such as the military and the intelligence community'' (143, p. 122) or to push funding towards countries of strategic importance, rather than those most in need (127) .",
