In the present study, a novel metastasis-related gene, fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2), was characterized for its role in CRC metastasis and underlying molecular mechanisms. The clinical significance of FGL2 was investigated using tissue microarray analysis of samples from 82 patients with CRC. The molecular effects of FGL2 in CRC cells were determined using RNA interference and ectopic expression of FGL2. The overexpression of FGL2 was examined by immunohistochemistry in 82 CRC patients, and it was determined to be an independent predictor of overall survival (P \\ 0.05). The depletion of FGL2 expression inhibited tumor progression and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and in vivo, while ectopic overexpression of FGL2 enhanced cell invasion and induced EMT in vitro. Our results suggest that FGL2 plays an important oncogenic role in CRC aggressiveness by inducing EMT, and FGL2 could be employed as a novel prognostic marker and effective therapeutic target for CRC.",

It has been identified as a novel effector molecule of Treg cells and plays a critical role in regulating both innate immunity and adaptive immunity [11] . Several studies have shown that FGL2 contributes to the pathogenesis of a number of infectious diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), HBV and HCV infection, mouse hepatitis virus strain 3 infection (MHV-3), and HIV infection [12] [13] [14] [15] . However, little is known about its biological functions in cancer development and metastasis until now. Previous work from Qin Ning's group demonstrated that FGL2 could contribute to HCC growth and angiogenesis in a thrombin-dependent manner, and it might be a potential therapeutic target in HCC [16] . The biological functions of FGL2 in CRC metastasis and the exact mechanism of how FGL2 exerts its function are still unclear.",

However, the biological functions of FGL2 in CRC metastasis and the exact mechanism of how FGL2 exerts its function are still unclear. One novel finding in our study is that FGL2 was closely associated with EMT in CRC. The EMT is a process that epithelial cells lose their cell polarity and cell-cell adhesion and gain migratory and invasive properties to become mesenchymal stem cells. A lot of previous study found that initiation of metastasis requires invasion, which is enabled by EMT [25, 26] . We found FGL2 knockdown caused a significant regression of EMT features, where a gain in the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin and a loss in the expression of mesenchymal marker N-cadherin were observed. In FGL2-overexpressed HT29 cells, increased expression of mesenchymal marker (N-cadherin) concurred with the enhanced invasive ability. In a tail vein injection mouse model of cancer metastasis, overexpression of FGL2 led to a significant increase in the number of lesions of lung metastasis. Since EMT plays a critical role in CRC Fig. 3 Effects of FGL2 on HT29 cell proliferation and invasion. a, b FGL2 expression in FGL2-HT29 cells was determined by real-time PCR and Western blot analyses. c, d Overexpression of FGL2 in HT29 significantly promoted cell proliferation and had no influence on cell viability from flow cytometry analysis. e Invasion assay showed that FGL2-HT29 cells exhibited enhanced invasive ability compared to mock cells invasion and metastasis, FGL2 involved in EMT induction may be a mechanistic link between FGL2 and CRC metastasis.",

Furthermore, functional studies of FGL2, as provided in this report, suggest a critical role of FGL2 in the control of cell invasion and EMT. The expression levels of E-cadherin and N-cadherin in relative cell lines were compared by immunofluorescence staining. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Knockdown of FGL2 expression may disrupt the EMT process in SW620 and LOVO cells. Besides, overexpression of FGL2 induced obvious EMT in HT29 cells",
