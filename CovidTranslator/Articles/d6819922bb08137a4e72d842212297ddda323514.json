Glial cell cultures were prepared from newborn syngeneic (C57B1/6J) and allogeneic (DBA/2) mouse brains. G1ial cultures 1-4 weeks of age were able to stimulate a-Class I-specific clones. No stimulation of a-Class II or a-background clones was noted. Incubation of glial cells with supernatants from cultures of alloantigen-activated spleen cells (C57B1/6J-anti-DBA/2) resulted in a decreased ability of glial cells to stimulate a-Class I responses. In contrast supernatant-treated cultures acquired the capacity to stimulate a-Class II-specific clones. No responses were noted in clones responsive to non-MHC antigens. The ability to stimulate a-Class II-specific clones was most prominent with bne-week-old glial cultures and was lost by four weeks of culture. The increased susceptibility of younger glial 226 cultures to the modulatory effects of lymphokines from activated T cells may be a factor in the increased susceptibility of the immature central nervous system to persistent viral infections and the development of autoimmune phenomena.",

            "text": "It has recently been demonstrated that central nervous system cells, especially glia, have immunologic activity. For example, astrocytes can produce an II-l-like substance (Fontana et al. 1978) , present antigen to sensitized lymphocytes (Fontana et al. 1984) , and stimulate lymphocytes in mixed lymphocyte culture (Wong et al. 1985) . Since antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) play a critical role in the recognition of 'foreign' and self-antigens by the immune system (Snell 1978) their presence on brain cells may be important in autoimmune reactions to brain. In the present report we addressed the following questions: (a) Do monolayer cultures of developing mouse glial cells stimulate alloantigen-specific murine T cell clones? (b) Can soluble products of activated lymphocytes affect the ability of glial cells to stimulate these clones? (c) Do glial cell cultures change with age in their ability to stimulate lymphocytes? (d) Do glial cell responses to lymphocyte culture supernatants change with glial cell age? The latter two questions were posed because of the particular susceptibility of the immature nervous system to both autoimmune phenomena and persistent viral infection (Miller et al. 1956; Stone and Lerner 1965; Kennedy 1968; Currier et al. 1974; Wolinsky et al. 1976; Lublin et al. 1981) .",

Proliferative responses of equivalent numbers of C2-11 cells to 5 x 106 allogeneic DBA spleen cells were usually 3-to 5-fold less than those observed with DBA glial ceils. Therefore, it is unlikely that the proliferation noted with glial cells was the result of contamination of these cultures by large numbers of hematopoietic ceils.

Since antibodies and T cells respond to different epitopes on MHC antigens (Cairns 1985) , these differences in technique could explain the inability of Hirsch et al. (1983) and Wong et al. (1984) to detect MHC antigens on untreated glial cells. Antigen presentation by astrocytes to lines of sensitized lymphocytes was noted by Fontana et al. (1984) suggesting that functional Class II antigens were present on glial cells even though they could not be serologically detected. Of additional interest is their observation that glial cells exposed to activated lymphocytes became Class II antigen positive. More recently, using both glioma cultures (Takiguchi et al. 1985) and normal brain cultures (Wong et al. 1985) investigators have shown that such cells can activate bulk cultures of allogeneic spleen cells to proliferate in MLC. These effects were increased by treating cells with v-interferon. To our knowledge our observations of the reciprocal effects of 2 \u00b0 SN on Class I and Class II antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation have not been described.",

Therefore, the decreased proliferative responses of a-Class I clones to 2 \u00b0 SN-treated glial cells may be explained in several ways: (1) decreased expression of Class I antigen, (2) decreased production of lymphocyte growth factors necessary for a-Class I clone proliferation, (3) a selective decrease of glial cells expressing Class I antigens, or (4) an enhanced cytotoxic response of a-Class I clones to treated vs. untreated glial cells, resulting in fewer stimulator cells being present. To evaluate the latter possibility we microscopically inspected 2 \u00b0 SN-treated and untreated glial cultures incubated with the a-Class I clones for loss or disruption of the glial cell monolayers. None could be detected. Therefore the lower proliferative responses of a-Class I clones to supernatant-treated glial cells did not appear to be the result of fewer glial cells being present in treated cultures. Experiments to investigate the other possibilities are in progress.",

Recognition of viral antigens by anti-viral cytotoxic cells occurs in conjunction with recognition of Class I MHC antigens (Snell 1978) . If products of lymphocytes activated during a viral infection can interfere with the recognition of this class of MHC antigens in vivo, less efficient killing of virus-infected cells may occur, resulting in incomplete elimination of the virus and possible persistence. Similarly, if products of activated lymphocytes allow recognition of Class II MHC antigens on brain cells not normally expressing them, helper T cells, responsive to antigens in the context of Class II MHC antigens, may be stimulated. Such helper cells are necessary for the induction of antibody responses to thymic-dependent antigens (Snell 1978) , the generation of cytotoxic T cells (Snell 1978) and have been implicated in the development of various autoimmune diseases (Theofilopoulos et al. 1979; Krakauer et al. 1981; Miller and Salem 1982) . Thus functional recognition of Class II antigens occurring as a result of lymphokine release during a CNS viral infection, could trigger an autoimmune response tO brain components. The work of Watanabe and colleagues (1983) , demonstrating acute EAE in recipients of cells from donors having viral encephalitis is indirect evidence in support of this hypothesis.",
