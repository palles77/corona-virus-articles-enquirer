            "text": "a b s t r a c t This study proposes a way of mapping open innovation research structure by quantitatively analyzing open innovation research papers retrieved from Web of Science database. A total of 130 papers are retrieved in this study and 62 papers which contain keywords are chosen for research structure visualization. Open innovation research networks are quantitatively investigated by combining network theory and keyword co-occurrence. Contour maps of open innovation are also created on the basis of networks for visualization. The networks and contour maps can be expressed differently by choosing different information as the main actors, such as the paper author, the institute, the country or the author-keywords, to reflect open innovation research structures in micro, meso, and macro-levels, respectively. The quantitative ways of exploring open innovation research structure are investigated to unveil important or emerging open innovation components as well as to demonstrate visualization of the structure of global open innovation research. The quantitative method provided in this project shows a possible way of visualizing and evaluating research community structure and thus a computerized calculation is possible for potential quantitative applications on open innovation research management, e.g. R&D resource allocation, research performance evaluation, and science map.",

            "text": "For example, Kostoff had a complete and systematic study on literature-related analysis and published a series of papers based on a combination of text mining and statistics from scientific papers. He also proposed a novel and intelligible technique called the Literature-Related Discovery method for linking two or more literature concepts together (Ding, Chowdhury, & Foo, 2001; Kostoff, Eberhart, & Toothman, 1998; Kostoff, Tshiteya, Pfeil, & Humenik, 2002; Kostoff, Tshiteya, Pfeil, Humenik, & Karypis, 2005; Kostoff, Bhattacharya, & Pecht, 2007; Kostoff, 2008) mapped information retrieval research by using coword analysis on papers collected from the Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) from 1987 until 1997 (Baldwin, Hughes, Hope, Jacoby, & Ziebl, 2003; Ding et al., 2001) mapped ethics and dementia research by using keywords (Baldwin et al., 2003; Tian, Wen, & Hong, 2008) used the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) database to measure scientific output in the field of Geographic Information System (GIS) by using keywords (Tian et al., 2008) . Similar approaches have been made to map knowledge evolution in other fields, such as software engineering (Coulter, Monarch, & Konda, 1998) , chemistry (Callon, Courtial, & Laville, 1991) , scientometrics (Courtial, 1994) , neural network research (Noyons & Van Raan, 1998; Van Raan & Tijssen, 1993) , biological safety (Cambrosio, Limoges, Courtial, & Laville, 1993) , optomechatronics (Noyons & van Raan, 1994) , bioelectronics (Hinze, 1994) , adverse drug reactions (Clarke, Gatineau, Thorogood, & Wyn-Roberts, 2007; Rikken, Kiers, & Vos, 1995) , biotechnology (De Looze & Lemari\u00e9, 1997; Rip & Courtial, 1984) , environmental science (Ho, 2007) , condensed matter physics (Bhattacharya & Basu, 1998) , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), tsunamis (Chiu & Ho, 2007; Chiu, Huang, & Ho, 2004) , and Parkinson's disease (Li, Ho, & Li, 2008) . Some studies were enhanced by combining keyword analysis with other forms of analysis. For example, morphology analysis was a conventional method of forecasting future technology and identifying technological opportunities. Yoon and Park (2004) argued that morphology analysis has its limitations because there was no scientific or systematic way of establishing the morphology of technology. Therefore, keyword-based morphology analysis was proposed. An example of thin film transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) was studied to illustrate the detailed procedure of this keyword-based morphology analysis (Yoon & Park, 2005) .",

Each resource exchange is a social network relation or a \"tie\" maintained by social actors at both ends of the \"tie.\" The strength of a tie is a function of the number of resource exchanges, the type of exchanges, the frequency of resource exchanges, or even how close the two connected actors are (Marsden & Campbell, 1984) .",

He surveyed a total of 282 job seekers with regard to the type of ties between the job seeker and the contact person who provided the necessary information. Of those who found jobs through personal contacts, only 16.7% reported seeing their contact person often. This illustrated that social network analysis is a proxy that provides a connection between microscopic analysis and macroscopic analysis. In the late 1990s, collaboration between researchers from different fields through the use of social network analysis had been initiated, and the field became more interdisciplinary. At that time, Barabasi and Albert (1999) demonstrated that the algebraic distribution in the connectivity of a scale-free network was caused by two basic factors in the temporal evolution of the network: growth and preferential attachment (Barabasi & Albert, 1999) . Watts and Strogatz (1998) published a breakthrough paper titled \"Collective dynamics of 'small world' networks,\" (Watts & Strogatz, 1998) , and a book titled \"Six Degrees: The Science of A Connected Age\" (Watts, 2003) which, together with other interdisciplinary works, contributed to the expansion of the \"small world\" concept from conventional neuroscience and bioinformation systems to any natural or human system that can be modeled by a network.",

In social network theory, centrality is used to estimate influence of actors. Centrality as an indicator can be used to understand in what degree an actor is able to obtain or control resources. Brass and Burkhardt (1992) indicated network centrality is one source of influence from the viewpoint of organizational behavior, a person with higher centrality in an organization is always the one with higher influence (Brass & Burkhardt, 1992) . Freeman (1979) suggested three methods of centrality measurement for a network: (1) degree centrality, (2) betweenness centrality, and (3) closeness centrality (Freeman, 1979) . Network properties are calculated by the above three methods in order to understand the power of influence of paper (first author), research organization, and country in the field of open innovation research. A social network can be either a directed network or an undirected network. But networks constructed in this research are undirected networks because no in-and-out concept, e.g. causal relation, position difference, flow, or diffusion, existed behind any linked keywords.",

Each of the three maps shows a big continent and a small island, visually presents the major research trend on the left and the smaller research group on the right, respectively. The colors of the contour plot (Figs. 6-8), indicate the degree of research concentration. Red color indicates high research concentration area where a lot of actors are doing similar researches that can be correlated to each other by their shared keywords. On the contrary, green color area is the area where low research concentration is found. Fig. 6 shows Belgium, Germany, France, Netherlands, Austria are located at the core (red color area) of the big continent. Germany has relatively large number of publications providing more opportunity to be link to other papers so it is easily to be located at the core of the map. However, for countries with smaller number of paper but still can be positioned in core area, such as Belgium (2 paper), France (2 papers), Australia (1 paper), is because keywords they used are also highly cooccurred in other papers and thus more connections to other papers can be expected. Both Finland (Hurmelinna, Kyl\u00e4heiko, & Jauhiainen, 2007) and Norway (Hildrum, 2009 ) form an isolated island on right hand sides of the map, the island is formed Table 7 Papers which form an isolated island in Fig. 6 by two papers listed in Table 7 . This suggests that Finland and Norway were doing researches similar to each other's but differed greatly from the global trend, and that Vietnam was a new entrant in this field.

The isolated island on the right side is formed by Netherlands' \"DSM Venturing & Business Development\" (Kirschbaum, 2005) and Taiwan's \"Aletheia University\" (Li, 2009 ) (Alethia University is located very close to DSM Venturing & Business Development, not shown in Fig. 7 but can be observed once after locally amplifying the isolated island). The detailed paper information are listed in Table 8 . Fig. 8 is global open innovation research map-paper (first author) as actor. Fig. 8 also shows a big continent dominated by Belgium Science Policy Office's Teirlinck, Innsbruck University's Matzler, and some other authors positioned on the red color area on the big continent. The isolated small island is formed by Kirschbaum (2005) and Li (2009) who are also the contributors of the small island in Fig. 7 . The detailed information for the small island are the same as what listed in Table 8 . Ideally, more researches would be desirable in order to build more connections among actors; in this way the knowledge structure of this field could be further enhanced and thus the research gap could be reduced. When it comes to research collaboration or competition, it should be noted that neighboring authors in Fig. 8 signify potential collaborators or competitors because these authors are doing similar research. Fig. 9 is global open innovation research map-keyword as actor. Fig. 9 shows five islands with a bigger one in the middle. Each of the islands is labeled by the most outstanding keyword, i.e. Future Study, Activation, Open Innovation, Connection Dynamics, Virtual Communities (from left to right). These keywords comprised in the five islands are: obtained that open innovation has a lot to do with idea, software and require consideration of technology transfer, IP, commercialization, in order to generate connection and networking which contribute to formation of virtual community and lead to better future environment. However, a more detailed analysis is necessary if a more specific question is to be answered.",

The most highly centralized papers are published by Belgium Science Policy Office, Innsbruck University and University of London, which lead their countries to be highly centralized. Top 10 actors in Tables 3-5 are all from Europe and USA. The three countries outside of Europe and USA in the research community are Korea, Taiwan and China, this might be due to their fast-paced development contexts. The US has the most papers in the field of open innovation but is only ranked Nos. 6-7 in network centralities. This is not very common because the US is easily ranked as the top one country in terms of research performance evaluated by different bibliometric analysis, due to its large number of researchers and research activities in many fields. Europe seems to be the leader of global open innovation research. Taiwan, Korea and China are three Asian countries ranked Nos. 10-14 in different network centralities, this has to do with their face-paced research induced by economic growth.",
