Keshavayya* and V.P. Vaidya pp 1048-1058 A series of 3,6-disubstituted 1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b]-thiadiazoles was synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial, antifungal, antiinflammatory and analgesic activities. Some of synthesized compounds showed moderate antimicrobial activities against tested bacterial and fungal strains. Eight compounds were synthesized as described below: the potassium salt of 2-aminobenzimidazole was first prepared by reaction with powdered potassium hydroxide in acetone at room temperature, and then submitted to the reaction with a slight excess of the alkyl halides to give the desired monoalkylated products.
