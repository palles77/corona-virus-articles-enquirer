Here, we propose that daily population-wide surveys that assess the development of symptoms caused by the virus could serve as a strategic and valuable tool for identifying such clusters to inform epidemiologists, public health officials, and policy makers. We show preliminary results from a survey of over 58,000 Israelis and call for an international consortium to extend this concept in order to develop predictive models. We expect such data to allow: Faster detection of spreading zones and patients; Obtaining a current snapshot of the number of people in each area who have developed symptoms; Predicting future spreading zones several days before an outbreak occurs; Evaluating the effectiveness of the various social distancing measures taken, and their contribution to reduce the number of symptomatic people. Such information can provide a valuable tool for decision makers to decide which areas need strengthening of social distancing measures and which areas can be relieved. Preliminary analysis shows that in neighborhoods with confirmed COVID-19 patient history, more responders report on COVID-19 associated symptoms, demonstrating the potential utility of our approach for detection of outbreaks.

Since then, Israel has gradually imposed several measures aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus (Figure 2 ). On March 9th, 14-day home isolation was extended to individuals arriving from anywhere in the world starting from their date of arrival. Individuals that were in close contact, defined by being within approximately 2 meters (6 ft 7 in) from a COVID-19 patient for more than 15 minutes, were also instructed to be in home isolation for a similar time period. Symptomatic individuals with fever above 38 Celsius and respiratory symptoms (cough or shortness of breath) were instructed to stay home for two days after the fever has dropped down 3 . On March 11th, gatherings were limited to a maximum of 100 people and on March 15th, to 10 people, with attendees advised to keep a minimal distance of 2 m (6 ft 7 in) between one another. On March 19th, a national state of emergency was declared in the country, and Israeli citizens were banned from leaving their homes unless absolutely necessary with the exception of essential services that remained open. On March 20st, the first death of an Isreali citizen as a result of COVID-19 infection occurred.",

Several other symptoms which are not common in patients with COVID-19 infection but are common in other infectious diseases were also included to discern possible COVID-19 patients.. The symptoms that were included are cough, fatigue, myalgia (muscle pain), shortness of breath, rhinorrhea or nasal congestion, diarrhea and nausea or vomiting. In addition, participants were asked about the existence of one of the following chronic health conditions: Diabetes mellitus, Hypertension, Ischemic heart disease, Asthma, chronic lung disease and chronic kidney disease. Participants were also asked to measure their daily body temperature and document it in the questionnaire (Figure 1 ). The number of reported symptoms divided by the number of symptoms in our predefined list. Symptoms in this list were predefined by the Israeli MOH and included: shortness of breath, fatigue, cough, muscle pains and a high fever (body temperature of over 38 degrees celsius).

A new version of the questionnaire was established on March 21 driven by new policies that have been implemented by the ministry of health ( Figure 2 ) and a comprehensive meta-analysis of 14 published papers on patients with COVID-19 symptoms (7 of which were on patients over 18 years old and 7 on patients under).

At the time of writing, only seven days after the survey was published, 54,059 responders have already completed it. As expected, we are also detecting a higher percentage of symptoms among individuals who are in home isolation, compared to those who are not (0.06 and 0.05 respectively, ). Temporal analysis of the e 0 p < 5 \u2212 1 symptoms rate during the first week shows a relatively stable rate in the population at daytime, where response rate is relatively high (Figure 1 ). Although the spread of COVID-19 infection is exponential 7 , and the number of confirmed COVID-19 patients in Israel has increased from 193 cases on March 14th 2020 to 883 patients on March 21th noontime 8 , it has yet to reach the vast majority of Israel's population. We therefore hypothesize that these symptoms may reflect other respiratory infections which are prevalent in Israel during this period (such as infections caused by an influenza virus), as many of these diseases share common symptoms 9 . This is supported by the fact that we detected symptoms which were less prevalent in patients with COVID-19 at a similar rate as those who were common in these patients. For example, cough, which is one of the most common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 infection 6 was present in a similar percentage of responders as rhinorrhea or nasal congestion which is uncommon in this infection (14%) (Table 1, Figure 4 ). If our hypothesis is correct, this rate can be viewed as a baseline rate that will allow us to further detect subtle changes with a high geographic resolution which may reflect a spread of COVID-19 infection.",

We currently provide a colormap of Israel by regions of symptoms ratio (Figure 3) , however, as the daily response rate will increase, enough data will be collected, enabling us to implement prediction models. These we hope would be leveraged by policy-makers to make informed decisions, by utilization of efficient regional prevention strategies rather than a universal approach. Second, it may also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of prevention strategies implemented by public health organizations, such as the various social distancing measures which are currently being employed in many countries, including Israel. This can be done by measuring the effect of different strategies on reducing the number of symptomatic individuals. Third, it may help in understanding the clinical course of COVID-19 infection by tracking the dynamics of symptoms in the population over time.",

Asking participants to fill the survey may raise issues of information privacy related to the collection of medical data, to avoid any privacy issues that may occur, our survey is filled anonymously. Moreover, since our survey is anonymous we cannot link the same responder's daily questionnaires, which can provide an individual trend as we proceed. However, our goal is to provide a macro-management tool which is still feasible. Finally, a main challenge when relying on this data is that it is prone to selection bias. We notice that regions with relatively high response rate are regions associated with higher socioeconomic status. It may also be assumed that people who answer these surveys tend to be more adherent to healthcare protocols and thus less likely to be infected. While some bias may decrease as these surveys become more popular and known and thus better reflect the true population, we intend to model and adjust for different factors such as age and location.",
