            "text": "Over the past four decades, information from diff erent lines of scientifi c inquiry has improved our understanding of antibody-mediated mechanisms that modulate severity of infections by diverse microorganisms. Independent studies of pathogenesis of cellular and host responses to acute and chronic human and animal infectious diseases have generated evidence that cross-linking of immune complexes with Fc\u03b3 receptors increases cellular infection, contributing to disease severity by a mechanism we call intrinsic antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. Intrinsic ADE is distinct from extrinsic ADE, whereby complexes of infectious agents with nonneutralising antibodies lead to an increased number of infected cells. Hawkes 1 made early observations in studies of the neutralisation of Murray Valley encephalitis virus by use of the serum-dilution, virus-constant method. Chick embryo fi broblast monolayers exposed to virus mixed with high dilutions of chicken antisera had more plaques than did those exposed to virus alone. 1 In follow-up studies, 2 this fi nding seemed to result from antibody stabilisation of infectivity by the Murray Valley encephalitis virus. A diff erent explanation emerged when sequential infections with dengue viruses resulted in dengue haemorrhagic fever. 3 When monocytes and macrophages were identifi ed as the main hosts of dengue infection, ADE was implicated. 4, 5 Infection with the Murray Valley encephalitis virus was increased by ADE in the 2% of functional chicken macrophages identifi ed in chick embryo fi broblasts. Because of the conformational requirement that Fc receptors and Fc\u03b3 termini must be of the same phylogenetic class, ADE in chick embryo fi broblasts was reported only when Murray Valley encephalitis virus antibodies were raised in chickens, not in mammals. 6,7",

About 21 of 30 Leishmania species that infect mammals can cause human infection. The disease exists as two major forms: cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic to many parts of the world, and is closely linked to specifi c geographical regions-with villages as little as 15 miles apart having diff erent infection rates. Visceral leishmaniasis, also known as kala-azar, is the most severe form of leishmaniasis and, after malaria, is the second-leading cause of death from parasitic infection, with an estimated 500 000 cases each year worldwide. 10 Some Leishmania species are closely linked to human beings and are commonly reported in cities (eg, L chagasi, L tropica), whereas others are more traditionally associated with animal species and are classifi ed as zoonoses (eg, L major).",

            "text": "Leishmania species are transmitted as promastigotes, motile forms that infect macrophages, and spread within hosts as amastigotes, the obligate parasites of macrophages. In human hosts, the responses to infection vary with Leishmania species and the patients' immune reactions. Patients whose lymphocytes produce high amounts of interferon \u03b3 from Th1-type T cells usually recover from cutaneous infections without treatment; after recovery, these patients are immune to reinfection. 11 Patients infected with visceral forms of the parasite produce high titres of antibodies, which do not contribute to host defence. Without treatment, these patients are not likely to recover from visceral leishmaniasis. 11 Mouse models exist for the study of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. For example, BALB/c mice are susceptible to this disease and develop progressive nonhealing lesions with many intracellular parasites within macrophages. 12 Despite the presence of high concentrations of antiparasite antibodies, these parasites usually disseminate to the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, thus mimicking human visceral leishmaniasis. In-vitro models are also available as promastigote or amastigote infections in cultures of bone marrow or peritoneal macrophages from mice or in human diff erentiated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). 13 During the 1980s and 1990s, several mammalian cytokines were discovered. Among these cytokines was mouse cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor produced by Th2 cells, later renamed interleukin 10. 14, 15 Interleukin 10 is a type 2 cytokine and the fi rst identifi ed member of a family of cytokines that include interleukins 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 29. 16 All these cytokines have similar genomic organisation, bind to receptors with similar structures and, in some cases, shared components, and all activate Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signalling pathways. Interleukin 10 is capable of inhibiting synthesis of proinfl ammatory cytokines such as interferon \u03b3, interleukins 2, 3, and 12, TNF, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Interleukin 10 also has a potent ability to suppress the antigen-presentation capacity of antigen-presenting cells. However, interleukin 10 is not always immunosuppressive. The cytokine can promote survival of natural killer cells and B cells and production of B-cell antibodies. 17 Interleukin 10 is made by macrophages and various T cells, including Th1, Th2, Th17, and T-regulatory cells. 18 Interleukin 10 has important roles in the regulation of immune responses and can also increase host susceptibility to intracellular infections. In a mouse model of cutaneous leishmaniasis, susceptibility to L major is associated with Th2 responses. CD4 T cells from susceptible BALB/c mice produce interleukins 4 and 10 when infected with L major, whereas CD4 T cells from resistant C57BL/6 mice express interferon \u03b3 and interleukin 2. 19 The transient depletion of CD4 cells or the in-vivo neutralisation of interleukin 4 in BALB/c mice promotes death of intracellular parasites and recovery from leishmanial lesions. Interleukin 4 is not the only determinant of susceptibility, however, because susceptible BALB/c mice that do not express interleukin 10 are fully resistant to infection. 20 Furthermore, in people in whom the Th1 to Th2 dichotomy is not as pronounced, interleukin 10 seems to be a major inducer of susceptibility. In people with visceral leishmaniasis, interleukin 10 titres in plasma directly correlate with disease severity. 21 Interleukin 10 is found in lymph nodes taken from patients with visceral leishmaniasis. 11 Furthermore, PBMCs from patients with acute visceral leishmaniasis respond to stimulation with leishmania lysate by producing interleukin 10 mRNA. When added to PBMCs, interleukin 10 suppresses production of interferon \u03b3 and interleukin 2, whereas, after treatment with anti-interleukin 10, PBMCs from patients with acute visceral leishmaniasis have a substantial increase in proliferative response to leishmania lysate. Results of invitro studies of peritoneal and bone marrow macrophages infected with Leishmania species show that the intracellular killing of this organism by macrophages activated by the classic pathway can be inhibited by treatment with exogenous interleukin 10 22,23 or by endogenous macrophage production of interleukin 10. 22 Interleukin 12 has a complementary role to interleukin 10, acting directly on CD4 T cells to enhance priming for interferon-\u03b3 production and to reverse interleukin-4 priming. 24 The most potent cytokine for the induction of leishmanicidal activity in macrophages is interferon \u03b3. 12 The sustained production of interferon \u03b3 in response to infection is commonly associated with the development of specifi c Th1 responses. In mice infected with L major, Review treatment with interleukin 12 increases interferon-\u03b3 production, reduces the severity of disease, potentiates vaccine-derived immunity, and suppresses interleukin-10 production. 25 However, exposure of macrophages from susceptible mice to opsonised leishmania promastigotes suppresses the expression of interleukin 12. 26 In bone-marrow-derived macrophages from BALB/c mice, the production of interleukin 12 in response to lipopolysaccharide is suppressed after ligation of Fc, complement, or scavenger receptors. 27 Both mRNA synthesis and protein secretion are diminished to almost undetectable levels after receptor ligation. TNF production is not inhibited, so suppression is specifi c to interleukin 12. Additionally, the ligation of mouse Fc\u03b3 receptor with immune complexes increases the production of interleukin 10. 28 Stimulation of mouse bone-marrow macrophages by lipopolysaccharide results in some interleukin-10 production, but the addition of red blood cells opsonised with IgG antibodies substantially increases interleukin-10 production. Immune complexes not only induce activated macrophages to produce interleukin 10, but they also induce both macrophages and dendritic cells to stop production of interleukin 12. 27, 29 Interleukins 10 and 12 in macrophages are modulated by diff erent mechanisms. 30 The abrogation of interleukin-12 biosynthesis is a property shared by ligation of several macrophage receptors, the induction of interleukin 10 is specifi c to Fc\u03b3 receptors. Additional evidence for the role of interleukin 10 in promoting chronic infection is provided by the observation that normal BALB/c mice develop progressive non-healing lesions with many L major parasites, whereas BALB/c mice that do not express interleukin 10 control disease progression and have small lesions with 1000-times fewer parasites at the 5th week of infection. 20 Furthermore, in established L donovani visceral infection in wild-type mice, treatment with monoclonal antibodies for either interleukin 10 or interleukin-10 receptor successfully induces intracellular parasite killing within liver macrophages. 31 These fi ndings and those from other studies 32, 33 indicate that amastigotes of leishmania exploit an unusual and unexpected virulence factor: host IgG. When the surface of Leishmania amastigotes are coated with IgG, the resultant immune complexes allow them to ligate Fc\u03b3 receptors on infl ammatory macrophages, preferentially inducing the production of high amounts of interleukin 10. 16 This induction of interleukin 10 by the IgG-amastigotes complex did not occur in macrophages derived from mice that did not have the common \u03b3 chain that signals through Fc\u03b3 receptors 1, 3, and 4, indicating that one or all of these three receptors were involved. 30 Results from subsequent studies that used defi ned immune complexes indicated that all three of the Fc\u03b3 receptors that signal through the gamma chain were capable of signalling for interleukin-10 production in macrophages. 34 Therefore, in some settings, IgG itself seems to bias the immune response towards a Th2-type response. For some species of Leishmania, the persistence of infection depends on whether amastigotes are coated with IgG. 23, [35] [36] [37] Production of interleukin 10 by ligation of Fc\u03b3 receptors is a generic process that does not require a non-microbial antigen. 38 When exposed to ovalbumin alone, lipopolysaccharide-treated BALB/c mouse macrophages develop Th1-biased T-cell responses, characterised by the production of interferon \u03b3. 38 When the same antigen is complexed with IgG anti-ovalbumin, Th2 responses predominate with production of interleukin 4. This Th2 phenotype is stable and retained when T cells are subsequently stimulated again under non-biasing conditions. Mice vaccinated with IgG-opsonised ovalbumin produce high titres of IgG antibody of the IgG1 isotype. 38 The T-cell biasing and its reversal via Fc\u03b3 receptor ligation is also seen in vivo. 38 In macrophages from knockout mice, the production of interferon \u03b3 by T cells is controlled by the macrophage cytokine interleukin 12, and the production of interleukin 4 by interleukin 10. These fi ndings show that the ligation of Fc receptors on activated macrophages reverses Th1 biasing that accompanies innate immune responses to microbial products.",

Ligation of macrophage Fc\u03b3 receptors produces a rapid and enhanced activation of two mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs): extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38. 43 The activation of ERK leads to the phosphorylation of serine 10 on histone H3 on the gene encoding interleukin 10, increasing the accessibility of the promoter to transcription factors generated in response to p38 activation (fi gure 1). Activation of both MAPKs is needed for interleukin-10 synthesis. In addition to ERK activation, an infl ammatory stimulus, such as low-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid from the extracellular matrix, is needed. The combination of these two signals results in the superinduction of interleukin 10. 44 Macrophages that do not have Fc\u03b3 receptors, or macrophages treated with an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (which is activated after Fc\u03b3-receptor ligation) do not activate ERK and fail to produce interleukin 10 after infection with Leishmania species amastigotes. 44",

            "text": "Many bacteria replicate partly or solely in human macrophages. Many organisms that do infect macrophages produce chronic infections. One of the criteria of successful parasitism by microorganisms that produce systemic infections might be the ability to evade microbicidal mechanisms of macrophages. These defensive mechanisms have been much studied. 45 The role of Fc receptors or immune complexes has not been studied exhaustively for most of these organisms. Although studies on resistance to tuberculosis have focused on T-cell immunity, C57BL/6 mice defi cient in inhibitory Fc\u03b3 receptor IIB have improved bacterial control and diminished pathological changes at 30 days but not 20 days after aerosol challenge with M tuberculosis. 46 Mice defi cient in Fc\u03b3 receptor IIB have increased production of the p40 subunit of interleukin 12. Interleukins 12 and 23 have the p40 subunit in common and both promote polarisation of naive CD4 T cells into Th1 eff ectors. 47 Treatment of human macrophages with exogenous interleukin 12 combined with blockade of interleukin 27 reduced the burden of mycobacterial infection. 48 These infections were characterised by large protective interferon-\u03b3 responses that coincided with increased activation of macrophages. In human beings, high concentrations of interleukin 10 are related to the suppression of host defence mechanisms and exacerbation of infection. 49 In a model of reactivation tuberculosis, the presence of macrophage-derived interleukin 10 in the lungs of infected transgenic mice enables Th1 cells to effi ciently express eff ector functions and secrete suffi cient interferon \u03b3 to induce activation of macrophages by the classic pathway, characterised by the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) and interferon-\u03b3 inducible protein member 1 (IRGM1; formerly LRG-47). 50 However, mycobacteria survived and successfully proliferated within mouse macrophages with interleukin-10 production under control of a human CD68 promoter. Macrophage-derived interleukin 10 seems to override interferon-\u03b3-dependent activation of macrophages by the classic pathway and other eff ector mechanisms against M tuberculosis by inducing an alternatively activated phenotype. So far, the specifi c contribution of M tuberculosis-IgG antibody complexes towards modulation of infections in model systems is unknown.",

Some viruses cause immune responses that sensitise hosts as a result of sequential infection by more than one antigenic type or as a result of the rapid evolution of antigenic diversity during the course of a chronic infection (table 1) . Hosts can be sensitised by other viruses that are given as killed vaccines (table 2) .

            "text": "Dengue viruses are a group of four closely related members of the Flavivirus genus that share 60-70% genetic homology and are inoculated by the bite of infected Aedes aegypti. Initial infections raise crossreactive non-neutralising antibodies that can enhance an infection with a diff erent virus type. 82 Data from in-vitro studies in Fc receptor-bearing cells indicate that any specifi city of monoclonal dengue antibodies might form infectious immune complexes, the major requirement being antibody concentration below that needed for neutralisation. 83, 84 In practice, antibodies directed at surface epitopes not involved in virus entry effi ciently produce ADE. 83, 85 The fact that infants might acquire severe dengue disease during a fi rst dengue infection when placentally acquired maternal polyclonal dengue antibodies have diminished to below protective concentrations is a unique example of ADE. 86 Results from studies of human tissues have established that monocytes, macrophages, and immature and mature dendritic cells are major targets for dengue virus infection. 87, 88 In human beings, secondary dengue infections follow a stereotypical course with severe outcomes, such as shock or gastrointestinal haemorrhage, accompanying vascular collapse that results from capillary permeability around the time of defervescence. 89 Indirect evidence suggests that cytokines mediate vascular permeability in patients with dengue infection. Much work has focused on the measurement of blood cytokine concentrations in patients late in the acute phase, just before onset of shock. 90 Elevated viraemia and high concentrations of proinfl ammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines, including interleukin 10, are associated with severe disease. 91 During in-vitro ADE infection of THP-1 cells (a human monocytic Fc\u03b3 receptor-bearing continuous cell line), intracellular dengue virus production is increased as a result of idiosyncratic Fc\u03b3-receptor signalling. 92 Infections with polyclonal antibodies plus dengue virus 2 result in a suppression of innate responses. After ligation of Fc\u03b3 receptor I and Fc\u03b3 receptor IIA, entry of infectious immune complexes activates expression of the negative regulators dihydroxyacetone kinase and the autophagy proteins Atg5-Atg12 of retinoic acid-inducible protein I/melanoma diff erentiation-associated gene 5 (RIG-I/MDA5), resulting in downregulation of the RIG-I/MDA5 signalling pathway and decreased production of type I interferon and interferon-activated antiviral molecules. 93 After ligation of Fc receptors, dengue virus infection activates interleukin-10 production at an early phase of infection. 92 The suppressive role of interleukin 10 during ADE infection has been confi rmed and not only induces Th2 biasing but also inhibits a potent suppressor of the JAK-STAT signalling pathway via the suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) system. 93 As a result of these two suppression pathways, ADEinfected THP-1 cells secrete low concentrations of type I interferon, thus suppressing transcription and translation of interleukin 12, interferon \u03b3, and TNF and facilitating expression and synthesis of anti-infl ammatory cytokines. This pathway of infection also suppressed an innate dengue virus mediator, nitric oxide radicals, by disrupting the transcription of the NOS2 gene transcription factor, IRF-1. Thus, ADE infection not only facilitates virus entry (extrinsic ADE), but also modifi es innate and adaptive intracellular antiviral mechanisms and enhances replication (intrinsic ADE; fi gure 2).",

Mature dendritic cells secreted interferon \u03b2 coincident with peak ADE. Immature dendritic cells are readily infected by dengue virus alone, a process effi ciently mediated by the attachment molecule dendritic cell-specifi c intercellular adhesion molecule-3grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN). 106 Monocytes secreted interleukin 10 during ADE infection at the same serum dilution that produced peak virus (Marovich MA, unpublished). Production of interleukin-10 protein was controlled by interleukin-10 promoter polymorphisms. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms at the 5' fl anking region of interleukin 10 (position -1082 A/G, -819 C/T, and -592 C/A) were studied. Dengue infection rates at enhancement titres were remarkably consistent in primary monocytes (10-15%) from 20 diff erent donors; homozygous GCC haplotype was associated with high interleukin-10 secretion, whereas donors with the ACC haplotype produced an intermediate concentration of interleukin 10, and the ATA haplotype secreted the lowest interleukin-10 concentrations.",

Passive transfer of virus-specifi c antibody at the peak of viral replication results in foci of necrosis around virus-infected cells, a reaction thought to be due to complement-mediated cytolysis. 60 Infectious immune complexes result in increased infection of mink peritoneal macrophages. 61 In one study, inoculation of an experimental killed Aleutian disease virus vaccine did not produce detectable neutralising antibodies, although eight of ten of vaccinated mink, but no control animals, developed the disease on challenge with live virus. 60 PRRS is caused by a member of the Arterivirus genus of the coronavirus family that was fi rst isolated in the Netherlands and classifi ed in 1991. The syndrome was recognised in the USA in the mid-1980s and called mystery swine disease and has also been called blue ear disease. There are two prototype strains of PRRS virus (European and North American) that cause similar clinical symptoms but are distinct viral genotypes whose genomes diverge by about 40%. 56, 117, 118 The genetic variation among the viruses varies geographically, increasing the diffi culty of vaccine development. 119 For reasons not understood, disease presentation varies between one herd and another. For every three herds exposed to PRRS, for the fi rst exposure, one herd will show no recognisable disease, the second might show mild disease, and the third will show moderate to severe disease: the better the health status of the herd, the less severe the disease. 117 Evidence exists that PRRS virus mutates as it multiplies, leading to some strains that are highly virulent and some that are not. 117, 118 PRRS virus has a particular affi nity for macrophages, particularly those in the lungs. 56, 120, 121 The virus multiplies in macrophages and kills these cells.

            "text": "Intrinsic ADE is linked to the immunobiology of interleukin 10, a complex type II cytokine that has a key role in many infectious processes. 16 Results from in-vitro experiments suggest that early production of interleukin 10 in dengue infections might have an important role in promoting ADE, whereas interleukin 10 produced in the latter half of secondary dengue infections might be immunoregulatory. Careful studies that follow up individuals through the course of primary mild and secondary severe dengue infections are needed. Events that simply accompany secondary immune responses should be distinguished from those responses that might contribute to immunopathological changes. 124 Several questions concern the essential and nonessential components of intrinsic ADE. Where, exactly, does interleukin-10 production fi t into this process? Does interleukin-10 production lead to increased infection in the initial infected cell, or does interleukin 10 mainly function on bystander cells? Are there functional diff erences between interleukin 10 of T-cell and macrophage origin? Another profound eff ect of interleukin 10 is to inhibit the production of proinfl ammatory cytokines and mediators from macrophages and dendritic cells. The major infl ammatory cytokines, interleukins 1, 6, and 12, and TNF, are all substantially repressed after exposure to interleukin 10.",

This pathway leads to the activation of transcription factors that have the potential to bind to the interleukin 10 promoter. In resting cells, this promoter is inaccessible to these transcription factors because it is tightly packed in chromatin. (B) The ligation of Fc\u03b3 receptors signals through a diff erent protein kinase, Syk, to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). This pathway leads to the phosphorylation of chromatin, making the promoter accessible to transcription factors. IRAK= interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase. TRAF6=TNF receptorassociated factor 6. I\u03baK=I\u03baB kinase. NEMO=NF\u03baB essential modulator.",

Additionally, interleukin-10 biosynthesis is activated, stimulating members of the suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) family, which results in suppression of the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signalling pathway and bias towards a Th2 response. By contrast, infection by naked virus via virus-specifi c receptor signals through pattern recognition receptor (PRRs) produces intracellular antiviral molecules. ADE=antibody-dependent enhancement.
