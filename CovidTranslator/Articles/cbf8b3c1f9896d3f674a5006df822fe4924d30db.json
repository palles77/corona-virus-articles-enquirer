To evaluate the epidemics and disease spectrum of HCoV-NL63 infection in children in Taiwan, we prospectively screened children admitted to the hospital with respiratory tract infection from May 2004 to April 2005. Every enrolled child had a nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) sample taken. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect 1b gene of HCoV-NL63. A total of 539 NPAs were collected. Seven (1.3%) were positive for HCoV-NL63. All cases were boys younger than 3 years of age and most cases occurred in autumn. Co-infection with other pathogens was observed in three cases. The most common symptoms/signs of HCoV-NL63 infection were cough, fever, and inspiratory stridor. HCoV-NL63 was the most common pathogen (14.7%) in children with croup and was the cause of three cases of croup in October. The odds ratio of croup in children infected with HCoV-NL63 was 43.4 (95% CI 8.1\u223c233.1).",

Apparently, HCoV-NL63 is largely a respiratory tract pathogen, capable of inducing upper and lower RTI, with symptoms considered to be more severe than those caused by HCoV 229E or HCoV OC43 [1] . In this study, we prospectively studied the role of HCoV-NL63 in Taiwanese children hospitalized due to respiratory tract infection. Among the 539 patients, seven cases of HCoV-NL63 infection were identified. Proportionally, 1.3% of children with RTI were infected with HCoV-NL63 in the study period. This rate is lower than those reported for other countries, which ranged from 2-8.8% [1-3, 6, 9, 11, 12] . However, this study recruited only admission cases and would miss children with mild symptoms that were not admitted. Indeed, HCoV-NL63 may be more prevalent in the out-patient than the in-patient group [14] . The majority of infected children were under 3 years old and all male in gender, which is similar to what has been reported previously [1-3, 6, 9, 11, 12] . Dual infections were frequent (43%) in this study. Van der Hoek et al. [14] described a significant difference between the HCoV-NL63 viral loads of singly infected and co-infection groups; however, we did not have similar observations in this study (p=0.229).",

In the present study, HCoV-NL63 was detected using quantitative RT-PCR targeting N gene, while previous studies targeted ORF 1a or 1b by conventional RT-PCR. The seasonality in the present study was in autumn, while in temperate countries it is winter [2, 6, 9, 11, 12] , and summer in Hong Kong [3] . Phylogenetic analysis of partial spike gene showed two lineages of HCoV-NL63 in the world; however, our study could not answer whether there was cocirculation of these two variants in 2004 and 2005 in Taiwan due to the small number of positive cases.",

One striking finding was the frequent occurrence of stridor and diagnosis of croup in patients with HCoV-NL63 infection. Previous studies found that acute bron- chiolitis was a common diagnosis in children with HCoV-NL63 infection (38\u223c67%). The relationship between Kawasaki disease and HCoV-NL63 was suggested in one study [7] , but could not be confirmed thus far in other studies [5, 10] . No children with HCoV-NL63 infection were suffering from Kawasaki disease in this case series. It is interesting to note that croup is a major clinical illness caused by HCoV-NL63. Viral croup accounts for 15% of respiratory tract infections in children [4] and 41,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States [8] .",
