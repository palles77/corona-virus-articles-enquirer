The virus can be transmitted by direct contact as well as by aerosol and is considered a potential bioweapon. Because direct immunization of the respiratory tract should be particularly effective against infection of mucosal surfaces, we previously developed an intranasal vaccine based on replication-competent human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) expressing EBOV glycoprotein GP (HPIV3/EboGP) and showed that it is immunogenic and protective against a high dose parenteral EBOV challenge. However, because the adult human population has considerable immunity to HPIV3, which is a common human pathogen, replication and immunogenicity of the vaccine in this population might be greatly restricted. Indeed, in the present study, replication of the vaccine in the respiratory tract of HPIV3-immune guinea pigs was found to be restricted to undetectable levels. This restriction appeared to be based on both neutralizing antibodies and cellular or other components of the immunity to HPIV3. Surprisingly, even though replication of HPIV3/EboGP was highly restricted in HPIV3-immune animals, it induced a high level of EBOV-specific antibodies that nearly equaled that obtained in HPIV3-na\u00efve animals. We also show that the previously demonstrated presence of functional GP in the vector particle was not associated with increased replication in the respiratory tract nor with spread beyond the respiratory tract of HPIV3-naive guinea pigs, indicating that expression and functional incorporation of the attachment/penetration glycoprotein of this systemic virus did not mediate a change in tissue tropism.",

The virus is transmitted by contact with infected patients or fluids and is thought to enter through breaks in the skin or inoculation of mucosal membranes (Geisbert and Jahrling, 2004; Jaax et al., 1995; Jaax et al., 1996) . The virus also was demonstrated to infect non-human primates by laboratory generated aerosol and is considered a potential biological weapon (Salvaggio and Baddley, 2004) . Development of a vaccine for EBOV is a priority. Two vectored vaccine candidates based on human adenovirus type 5 and vesicular stomatitis virus and a third candidate based on a virus-like particle, all delivered parenterally, were shown to be protective in non-human primates (Jones et al., 2005; Sullivan et al., 2000; Warfield et al., 2007) . We are interested in the general issue of developing vectors for direct immunization of the respiratory tract, which frequently can be a portal of infection by highly pathogenic viruses. The induction of a local immune response in the respiratory tract would be advantageous for prevention of EBOV transmitted by contact with respiratory mucosa or by aerosol.",

HPIV3 is an enveloped RNAcontaining virus of Family Paramyxoviridae that is a common cause of human pediatric disease (Karron and Collins, 2007) . Its genome is a single negative-sense strand of RNA of 15,462 nt that encodes six essential viral proteins, namely the major nucleocapsid protein N, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein P, matrix protein M, fusion glycoprotein F, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoprotein HN, and large polymerase protein L. HPIV3 also encodes accessory C and D proteins from overlapping open reading frames in the P gene, and there is genetic evidence for expression of a third protein, V. HPIV3 replicates primarily in the superficial cells of the lumen of the respiratory tract and remains largely restricted to that site (Zhang et al., 2005) . Using reverse genetics, one or more open reading frames encoding foreign proteins can readily be placed under the control of independent sets of HPIV3 gene-start and gene-end transcription signals and inserted into the HPIV3 gene order (Skiadopoulos et al., 2002) . Infection with HPIV3 induces both systemic and local respiratory tract immune responses to itself and, when used as a vector, to expressed foreign glycoproteins. Direct inoculation of HPIV3/EboGP into the respiratory tract of HPIV3-seronegative guinea pigs (Bukreyev et al., 2006b) and African green monkeys (Bukreyev et al., 2007) resulted in effective induction of EBOV-specific serum antibodies and protection against intraperitoneal challenge with a high dose of EBOV.",

In animals and humans, EBOV typically establishes a systemic infection resulting in high EBOV titers in internal organs and blood whereas, in contrast, HPIV3 is pneumotropic.

            "text": "In addition, we investigated a potential complication of the use of HPIV3 as a vector. Because HPIV3 is a common human pathogen, most of the adult human population has substantial immunity due to prior natural exposure. This prior immunity would be expected to restrict replication of HPIV3/EboGP, although this effect might be offset by the presence of functional GP for which the human population is na\u00efve. Reduction in vector replication could greatly reduce the immunogenicity of the expressed foreign antigen. This problem would not unique for an HPIV3-based vector, since several current human vaccine candidates are based on viral vectors that are common human pathogens (reviewed in Bukreyev et al., 2006a) . For example, comparison of immunogenicity of several vaccinia virus-vectored and human adenovirus type 5-vectored vaccines in pre-clinical trials with rodents and non-human primates and in clinical studies demonstrated that preexisting immunity to the vector can reduce or completely abolish immunogenicity of these vaccines Casimiro et al., 2003; Fitzgerald et al., 2003; Kanesa-thasan et al., 2000; Lemckert et al., 2005; Sharpe et al., 2001; Sumida et al., 2004; Zhi et al., 2006) . In particular, induction of EBOV-specific cellular and humoral responses by a recombinant adenovirus type 5 expressing EBOV GP in mice was reduced due to prior exposure to adenoviral vector (Yang et al., 2003) . In the present study, we evaluated replication and immunogenicity of HPIV3/EboGP in guinea pigs that had recently been infected with HPIV3. We show here that, despite restriction of replication of the vaccine by pre-existing HPIV3-specific immunity, the expressed EBOV GP remained highly immunogenic.",

For both HPIV3-and HPIV3/EboGP-infected animals, viral antigen (stained brown) was detected in bronchi and bronchioles extending into inflammatory alveolar lesions.

This was evaluated in vitro by infecting replicate cultures of A549 cells with HPIV3 or HPIV3/EboGP at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 PFU/cell and, after an 80 min adsorption period, incubating the cultures with medium containing a 1:100 dilution of polyvalent HPIV3-specific antiserum. The cultures were incubated at 32\u00b0C and aliquots of the overlying medium were collected daily for virus titration by plaque assay. In cultures where the antiserum had not been added, each virus replicated efficiently (Fig. 3A, top) . In cultures incubated in the presence of antiserum, HPIV3 was not detected on days 1 -5, and only a very low, barely detectable titer was detected on day 6. In contrast, HPIV3/EboGP was recovered in the presence of anti-HPIV3 antibodies with titers ranging from 3.5 to 4.7 log 10 PFU/ml (Fig. 3A , bottom), although these titers were much lower than that in the cells containing no antibodies (Fig. 3A, top) . To confirm that this represented increased infection of the cell monolayers, cells were harvested on days 3 and 5 and were subjected to Western blot analysis with HPIV3-specific antiserum. This showed that, in the absence of HPIV3-specific antiserum in the medium, there was an abundant level of cellassociated HPIV3 proteins in cultures infected with either HPIV3 or HPIV3/EboGP, as expected ( Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3) . With the inclusion of HPIV3-specific antiserum, the level of intracellular HPIV3 protein was dramatically reduced for both HPIV3 and HPIV3/EboGP, an effect that was greater for HPIV3 than HPIV3/EboGP (Fig. 6 , lane 4 versus 5 and 7 versus 8). Thus, while HPIV3/EboGP was somewhat resistant to neutralization by HPIV3-specific antiserum, multi-cycle infection by either virus was strongly inhibited by HPIV3-specific antibodies.",

This was done by measuring the restriction conferred by prior infection with HPIV3-1, a chimeric HPIV3 virus in which the two surface glycoproteins, HN and F, were replaced with their counterparts from serologically unrelated HPIV1, and which replicates in vitro and in vivo as efficiently as wild type HPIV1 and HPIV3 (Tao et al., 1998) . The HN and F proteins are the only HPIV antigens that induce neutralizing antibodies (Karron and Collins, 2007) , and there is no cross-protection in vivo between HPIV3 and HPIV1 (Tao et al., 2000) ; thus, any HPIV3-specific immunity induced by HPIV3-1 would involve only the internal virion proteins, would not involve neutralizing antibodies, and presumably would primarily involve cellular immunity (Tao et al., 1998) . As a caveat, we cannot exclude the possibility that the internal proteins of HPIV3 might induce antibodies that do not neutralize the virus in vitro but might restrict replication in vivo; such antibodies have been described for several viruses, including rotavirus (Burns et al., 1996; Feng et al., 2002) and Sindbis virus (Mendoza, Stanley, and Griffin, 1988) , although not for HPIV3 thus far.",

Infection with HPIV3 resulted in a reciprocal antibody titer of 11.7\u00b10.4 log 2 , whereas there was no detectable HPIV3-specific response in HPIV3-1-infected or mockinfected animals (reciprocal titer <2 log 2 ). We also analyzed these sera for the ability to neutralize HPIV3 and HPIV3/EboGP using an in vitro plaque reduction assay. This showed that sera from animals infected with HPIV3 completely neutralized HPIV3 and incompletely neutralized HPIV3/EboGP, as previously described (Introduction, and Bukreyev et al., 2006b) , whereas neither virus was neutralized with the sera from HPIV3-1-immunized or mock-immunized animals (data not shown).

In this assay, the threshold cycle (Ct) is the number of cycles required for amplification of a sample into a detectable signal, and thus would be low for samples with high viral titers as determined by TCID 50 assay and would be high for low-titer samples. The results of the N gene-specific assay are shown in Fig. 4B . Similar to the virus titration results (Fig. 4A) , there was no significant difference in Ct between the two challenge viruses (HPIV3 and HPIV3/EboGP) in either of the immunization groups (HPIV3 and HPIV3-1) and at either anatomical location. In addition, the Ct values of the HPIV3-immunized groups were significantly higher than those of the mock groups, and the Ct values of the HPIV3-1 groups were significantly lower than those of the HPIV3 groups, and greater (although not significantly so) than the mock groups. Similar data were obtained with the HN gene-specific assay (not shown).

With regard to the internal proteins, while we cannot exclude a possible contribution by antibodies not detectable by an in vitro neutralization assay, it seems likely that cellular immunity made the major contribution to this effect. In addition, the finding that HPIV3/EboGP was at least as restricted as HPIV3 by prior immunity to HPIV3-1 is a further indication that expression and incorporation of the foreign GP did not confer increased replication or substantial escape from HPIV3-specific immunity, in this case mediated by factors other than neutralizing antibodies.",

This might reflect the somewhat reduced replication of HPIV3/EboGP compared to HPIV3, as was observed in Fig. 1 , as well as a possible reduction of the density of the HN protein on the surface of the viral particles due to incorporation of the GP protein (Bukreyev et al., 2006b) .

Surprisingly, a strong serum antibody response to EBOV was achieved even in animals that were previously infected with HPIV3 (group 2): the EBOV-specific antibody titer achieved in HPIV3-immune animals (group 2) was only slightly less than that achieved in non-HPIV3immune animals (group 4) on day 28 following the second infection, and was essentially equivalent on day 42. These data indicate that, despite the restriction of HPIV3/EboGP replication in HPIV3-immune animals, the vaccine construct was highly immunogenic. In addition, we also observed a significant increase over time in the titer of EBOV-specific antibodies in animals that received a single dose of HPIV3/EboGP on day 0 (group 6): specifically, on days 77 and 91, the titers were increased 2.1-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively, compared to day 42.

We immunized four guinea pigs by the IN route with 4\u00d710 6 TCID 50 of HPIV3/EboGP and another four animals with UVinactivated HPIV3/EboGP.

Twenty-nine days after inoculation, serum samples were collected and analyzed for the presence of serum antibodies specific to HPIV3 or EBOV as above. As in the previous experiments, all of the animals immunized with infectious HPIV3/EboGP developed high titers of serum antibodies specific for both HPIV3 and EBOV (Fig. 6A ). In contrast, three of the four animals immunized with UV-inactivated HPIV3/EboGP remained HPIV3 seronegative while the remaining animal had a low level HPIV3-specific antibodies (titer 1:64).

However, it also was conceivable that, in the HPIV3-immune animals, an antibody-mediated enhancement occurred independent of replication, such as through capture of antibody-virus complexes by dendritic cells and macrophages. To investigate this, we infected or mock-infected groups of guinea pigs by the IN route with 4\u00d710 5 TCID 50 of HPIV3. Forty-two days later, the animals were immunized by the IN route with 4\u00d710 6 TCID 50 of HPIV3/EboGP or with an equivalent amount of UV-HPIV3/ EboGP. In both HPIV3-immune and non-immune animals, HPIV3/EboGP induced strong EBOV-specific antibody responses, as already seen, whereas the response to UV-HPIV3/ EboGP was marginal (like that in Fig. 6A ) and was not different between the immune and nonimmune animals.

To test this possibility, we infected six guinea pigs with HPIV3/EboGP by the IN route, six animals with HPIV3/EboGP by the IM route, and three animals with HPIV3 by IM route, using a dose of 4\u00d710 6 TCID 50 in each instance.

This was not surprising, since IM inoculation with respiratory syncytial virus had previously been shown to induce a titer of neutralizing serum antibodies that was one-third that of the high titer induced by IN infection, apparently reflecting an abortive replicative cycle at the site of IM injection (Prince et al., 1979) . In contrast, IM infection with HPIV3/EboGP resulted in only a low level of EBOV-specific serum antibodies, with the average magnitude of 3.5\u00b10.9 log 2 , that was 114fold lower than that in the control animals immunized through the IN route in the same experiment (Fig. 6B, right panel) . The reduced immunogenicity of HPIV3/EboGP given parenterally was interpreted as an indication that the virus did not efficiently infect cells or did not efficiently replicate following parenteral administration. The substantial response specific to HPIV3 HN detected by the HAI assay may reflect an unusually high immunogenicity of this protein. The lack of significant EBOV-specific response following the IM infection supports the idea that HPIV3/EboGP had a reduced rather than increased capability to replicate systemically, and also is consistent with the idea that the amount of protein contained in the inoculum is insufficient to be significantly immunogenic on its own in naive animals.",

When HPIV3/EboGP was administered IN to non-immune animals, high levels of virus replication occurred and resulted in robust serum antibody responses to both the vector and the insert. The animals were not challenged with EBOV in this particular study, since we previously demonstrated that these levels of EBOV-specific antibodies are associated with a uniform protection against a highly lethal dose of EBOV (Bukreyev et al., 2006b ). In the present study, we also showed that pulmonary replication of HPIV3/EboGP was slightly reduced compared to its HPIV3 parent, and that infectious virus could not be detected in the peripheral blood or in the liver, kidney, and spleen. In addition, parenteral inoculation with HPIV3/EboGP did not induce significant levels of serum antibodies to EBOV. Thus, even though EBOV GP was incorporated into the vector particle and conferred resistance to HPIV3specific antibodies and sensitivity to EBOV-specific antibodies (evidence that it was functional in initiating infection), this did not result in increased pulmonary replication nor did it confer the ability to spread to and replicate detectably in peripheral tissues. This is noteworthy since EBOV GP mediates both viral attachment and entry, and thus would have the potential to alter tropism on its own. Guinea pigs are highly permissive to replication of guinea pig-adapted EBOV (which, as noted above, not require mutations in GP) and are very sensitive to virusinduced disease and death, and thus provided a sensitive test for increased pathogenicity due to EBOV GP. These findings form a precedent that is of general usefulness and relevance with regard to the issue of the biological safety of recombinant vectors the express foreign surface proteins and incorporate these proteins in the vector particle.",

This restriction of replication was mediated by both the antibody and cellular components of the immune response, which was determined using animals that had been immunized with a chimeric HPIV3-1 virus that expresses the \"internal\" proteins of HPIV3 and the surface neutralization antigens of HPIV1. Surprisingly, despite the lack of detectable replication of HPIV3/EboGP in the respiratory tract, its immunogenicity was essentially the same as that observed in HPIV3-naive animals, which is sufficient for protection against EBOV challenge (Bukreyev et al., 2006b) . One caveat is that we did not directly measure cell-mediated responses to HPIV3/EboGP in HPIV3-immune animals, due to a lack of available reagents. Therefore, we cannot rule out the formal possibility that the cellular immune response was substantially reduced in HPIV3-immune animals. However, even without any contribution from cell-mediated immunity, the levels of EBOV-specific serum antibodies that were achieved would be consistent with substantial protection. In the present study, the mean reciprocal ELISA titers of EBOV-specific serum antibodies were approximately 1:3,500 on day 28 and 1:7,500 on day 42. Previous studies showed that passive EBOV-specific antibodies alone can provide substantial protection against EBOV challenge. In one study, guinea pigs were infected intraperitoneally with EBOV and immediately given EBOV-specific passive antibodies by the subcutaneous route. A dose of antibodies that conferred a serum ELISA titer of 1:80 -1:160 when measured two days later provided complete protection against the day 0 infection with 10,000 PFU of guinea pig-adapted EBOV (Jahrling et al., 1999) . In a comparable experiment in mice, a dose of antibodies that conferred a serum ELISA titer of approximately 1 : 6,400 when measured on day 1 provided high level protection against a day 0 challenge with 1,000 PFU of EBOV (Gupta et al., 2001) . This suggests that the response achieved by HPIV3/EboGP in HPIV3-immune animals in the present study would be protective.",

            "text": "Several mechanisms by which HPIV3/EboGP retained its immunogenicity in HPIV3-immune animals can be suggested. One possibility was that the presence of functional EBOV GP in the vector particle conferred increased infectivity and spread in HPIV3-immune animals. In monolayer cell culture, we found that HPIV3/EboGP indeed was more resistant than HPIV3 to neutralization by HPIV3-specific antibodies and had a somewhat greater ability to spread under those conditions. Although this effect was modest under the conditions that were tested in vitro, it might be sufficient to confer increased immunogenicity in vivo. In addition, the IN route of administration might play a role in the ability to immunize despite pre-existing immunity to the vector. Specifically, the effectiveness of host immunity in the respiratory tract characteristically is incomplete due to the short-lived nature of mucosal immunity following a primary infection, the inefficiency by which serum antibodies gain access to the respiratory lumen, and the functional impairment of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the lung (Vallbracht, Unsold, and Ehl, 2006) . In addition, certain respiratory viruses such as the HPIVs and respiratory syncytial virus seem particularly able to partially evade host immunity and establish symptomatic re-infections whereas other respiratory viruses such as influenza virus and adenovirus are more strongly restricted by prior immunity. Although the basis behind the reinfectability of viruses such as HPIV3 is poorly understood, this may contribute to the effect observed here. A recent study showed that, when cotton rats that were immune to respiratory syncytial virus were re-infected with the virus, the level of intracellular viral RNA synthesis during the first 12-24 h of infection was nearly as high as in non-immune animals even though no infectious progeny virus was detected in the immune animals throughout the infection (Boukhvalova, Prince, and Blanco, 2007) . Thus, prior immunity did not seem to restrict infection and the initial viral replicative cycle, which presumably would result in substantial antigen synthesis. In this context, it is noteworthy that a recent study demonstrated that activation of respiratory dendritic cells takes place within the first 24 h after infection of mice with influenza virus (Legge and Braciale, 2003) , which is long before the peak of the virus replication in lungs. After that, respiratory dendritic cells become refractory to stimulation by the virus (Legge and Braciale, 2003) . Therefore, the effective presentation of EBOV antigen may depend more on the initial infectability and initial replicative cycle of the virus and be less dependent on the magnitude of subsequent replication.",

            "text": "We had previously assumed that HPIV3-based vectors would not be sufficiently immunogenic in adolescents and adults due to the prevalence of immunity to this common human pathogen. However, the present study suggests that use of the pneumotropic HPIV3 vector and the topical route of immunization may provide for substantial immunization in immune individuals. Indeed, if the vector is restricted by host immunity but is nonetheless immunogenic, vaccine safety would be increased. However, it will be essential to confirm that HPIV3/EboGP is immunogenic in HPIV3-immune non-human primates, which are anatomically and phylogenetically more closely related to humans. That would be followed by clinical trials, which in the interest of safety would employ an attenuated version of HPIV3 as vector. Several such attenuated versions have been or presently are in clinical trials as pediatric intranasal HPIV3 vaccine candidates . Since non-human primates are less permissive than humans to HPIV3 replication, results obtained in non-human primates using wild type HPIV3 as vector may be comparable to what would be observed in humans using an attenuated derivative as vector. We also are developing chimeric viruses in which the HN and F proteins of the HPIV3 vector are deleted and replaced by GP. This would provide a vector that would not be neutralized by HPIV3-specific antibodies against the major HN and F antigens. While this chimeric virus would remain sensitive to HPIV3-specific cellular immunity directed against \"internal\" HPIV3 proteins, that immune component is much less long-lived than neutralizing antibodies and likely would be less effective in restricting the vector. Finally, use of non-human respiratory paramyxoviruses such as Newcastle disease virus as a platform for intranasal vaccine against EBOV may also be a promising approach .",
