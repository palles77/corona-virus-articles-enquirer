Outbreak response continues to follow nine basic principles: establish the presence of an outbreak, verify the diagnosis, make a case definition, find cases and contacts, conduct basic epidemiology, test hypotheses, institute control measures, communicate the situation and establish ongoing surveillance. Within each of these areas, significant advances have been made over the past 5 years using progress in digital, laboratory, epidemiology and anthropological equipment or techniques. Irrespective of these, future outbreaks of highconsequence are inevitable, and vigilance and preparation must continue in order to prevent significant mortality, morbidity and socio-economic crisis.",

For most outbreaks (LF, plague, Zika, MERS-CoV, monkeypox, Rift Valley fever) vaccines for human use are only available in trials. Ebola vaccination broke the mould: a novel trial design involving ring vaccination with recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine given to contacts of cases demonstrated high efficacy in Guinea, 22 allowing this vaccine to be deployed in DRC in 2018. The need for rapid vaccine development led to the formation of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a public-private partnership which is funding the development of vaccines for MERS-CoV, LF and Nipah viruses.",
