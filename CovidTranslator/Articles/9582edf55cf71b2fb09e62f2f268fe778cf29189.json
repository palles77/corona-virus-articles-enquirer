The structures of both SUD-M (previously determined) and SUD-C (from the present study) are maintained in SUD-MC, where the two domains are flexibly linked. Gelshift experiments showed that both SUD-C and SUD-MC bind to singlestranded RNA and recognize purine bases more strongly than pyrimidine bases, whereby SUD-MC binds to a more restricted set of purine-containing RNA sequences than SUD-M. NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments with observations of 15 N-labeled proteins further resulted in delineation of RNA binding sites (i.e., in SUD-M, a positively charged surface area with a pronounced cavity, and in SUD-C, several residues of an anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet). Overall, the present data provide evidence for molecular mechanisms involving the concerted actions of SUD-M and SUD-C, which result in specific RNA binding that might be unique to the SUD and, thus, to the SARS coronavirus.",

            "text": "The SUD was initially annotated as a continuous polypeptide segment of 357 amino acid residues located in sequence positions 366-722 of the SARS-CoV nsp3. 15 In the meantime, atomic resolution structural studies revealed that the SUD actually contains three distinct globular domains, SUD-N (N-terminal region of SUD), SUD-M (middle region of SUD), and SUD-C (C-terminal region of SUD), with residues 387-524, 527-651, and 655-720, respectively, which are connected by short linker peptide segments. NMR structure determination showed that the 'middle domain' SUD-M forms a macrodomain fold, and biochemical experiments and NMR chemical shift mapping resulted in the identification of a putative RNA binding site on the protein surface. 16 The NMR structure of SUD-M was then used in a molecular replacement approach to solve a crystal structure of SUD-NM, which contains the two domains SUD-N and SUD-M in a construct of residues 389-652. 17 The crystal structure was found to be a dimer of this twodomain construct, with SUD-N also forming a macrodomain fold. The linker peptide between SUD-N and SUD-M was not observed in the protein crystals. With biochemical experiments, it was further shown that SUD-NM forms complexes with G-quadruplexes. 17 This work describes new NMR structure determinations of SUD-C and of a two-domain construct SUD-MC with residues 527-720. Combined with the previous structure determination of SUD-M, 15 these results are used for detailed comparisons of the SUD-M and SUD-C domains in isolated form and in the two-domain construct, and for investigations of the nature of the link between the two domains. We further present NMR data on SUD-N and SUD-NM in constructs comprising residues 387-524 and 387-651, respectively, which supplement the aforementioned crystal structure of SUD-NM with a description of the behavior of this protein in solution. Specifically, biochemical data and NMR experiments define the oligomerization state of SUD-NM and the interactions between the N-and M-domains in SUD-NM. The structure determinations are supplemented with investigations of the RNA binding properties of SUD-M, SUD-C, and SUD-MC based on biochemical data and NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments.",

There are two longer strands, \u03b24 and \u03b25, of residues 682-688 and 691-695, followed by a seven-residue loop, another hairpin of strands \u03b26 and \u03b27 (residues 703-705 and 708-710), and helix \u03b12 (712-719). The seven extended strands form a twisted anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet (Fig. 1b) , with the topology shown in Fig. 1c , where the two short strands \u03b22 and \u03b23 are both paired in anti-parallel fashion with \u03b24. The fold is classified in the SCOP database 19 as 'N-terminal domain of CyaY-like.'",

These assignments were used as input for the analysis of the nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra with UNIO-ATNOS/ ASCAN 20,21 and UNIO-ATNOS/CANDID, 22 which yielded amino acid side-chain assignments and input for the structure calculation with CYANA 23 (for details, see Materials and Methods). The resulting structure ( Fig. 2a and b ) was based on 3750 nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) restraints (916 intraresidual, 954 short range, 767 medium range, and 1113 long range). While there were a small number of NOEs between domain hydrogen atoms and hydrogens in the linker peptide or in the short, chain-terminal tails, no NOEs that would connect hydrogen atoms in the two different domains were observed. In Fig. 2a and b, SUD-M and SUD-C are superimposed independently, and it is apparent that there is a large manifold of possible orientations for the domain that was not used for the superposition, showing that the two domains do not adopt a unique orientation relative to each other. In view of this result, we repeated the last cycle of the structure calculation separately for each domain, using NOE restraints within the two individual globular domains (residues 527-648 and 654-720) that had been measured in intact SUD-MC. The results of these two structure calculations (Table 1) show that the two domains are individually well defined in SUD-MC.",

The linker residues 651-653 that connect the two domains exhibit 15 N{ 1 H} NOE values ranging from 0.2 to 0.4, indicating significant segmental mobility, whereas the mobility of the residues within both globular domains is essentially limited to the overall molecular tumbling of the protein, with 15 N{ 1 H} NOE values of 0.7-0.8.

Structure calculations were performed for the intact construct of SUD-MC and also for the two individual domains of residues 527-648 (SUD-M) and residues 655-720 (SUD-C) using the input measured with SUD-MC, since no medium-range or long-range distance constraints between the two domains were observed. In the table, we only list the statistics for calculations with the individual domains in SUD-MC (PDB codes 2KQV and 2KQW for SUD-M and SUD-C, respectively), since these coincide very closely with the result of a calculation for the intact SUD-MC, as presented by Fig. 2a and b , with backbone RMSDs of 0.23 and 0.21 \u00c5 for SUD-M and SUD-C, respectively. c Isolated SUD-C (PDB code 2KAF). d BB indicates the backbone atoms N, C \u03b1 , and C\u2032; HA stands for \"all-heavy atoms.\" The numbers in parentheses indicate the residues for which the RMSD was calculated. e As determined by PROCHECK. 18 Fig. 3a and b, together with the 13 C \u03b1 and 13 C \u03b2 chemical shift data presented in Fig. 3c and d, further show that there are also no outstanding local differences between the SUD-M and the SUD-C polypeptide backbone folds determined either from data collected with individual domains or from data collected with SUD-MC. The isolated SUD-N formed by the polypeptide of nsp3 residues 387-524 is monomeric in solution, as judged by the two-dimensional (2D) 15 N, 1 H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum ( Fig. 4a and b, blue peaks), which contains 130 of the 133 expected backbone 15 N-1 H correlation peaks and shows line shapes that are typical of a small globular protein. This conclusion is supported by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 5a) , where SUD-N elutes at an apparent molecular mass of 19 kDa, which is close to the actual molecular mass of 15.2 kDa and would be inconsistent with a 30.4-kDa dimer. 16 superimposed for minimal RMSD of the N, C \u03b1 , and C\u2032 atoms of residues 527-648. This bundle has been superimposed with the NMR structure of SUD-M calculated from data collected with SUD-MC, which is represented by the conformer that has the minimal RMSD to the mean coordinates of the bundle of 20 conformers in Fig. 2a (black). (b) Stereo view of the bundle of 20 energy-minimized NMR conformers calculated from data collected with the isolated SUD-C (cyan), superimposed for minimal RMSD of the N, C \u03b1 , and C\u2032 atoms of residues 655-720. This bundle has been superimposed with the NMR structure of SUD-C calculated from data collected with SUD-MC, which is represented by a single conformer as described in (a) (black). (c and d) Chemical shift deviations from random-coil values in SUD-M and SUD-C, respectively. Values of \u0394\u03b4( 13 C \u03b1 ) and \u0394\u03b4( 13 C \u03b2 ) were determined with the program UNIO by subtracting random-coil chemical shifts from experimentally observed chemical shifts. The \u0394\u03b4 i value for each residue is an average value over three consecutive residues i \u2212 1, i, and i + 1, given by 24 Residues in helices typically have positive \u0394\u03b4 i values, while those in \u03b2-strands have negative values. The \u0394\u03b4 i values for the isolated domains are plotted in black, where the data for the isolated SUD-M were taken from Chatterjee et al., 16 and those in the intact SUD-MC construct are shown in red. Above the plots, the locations of regular secondary structures, as determined by PROCHECK, are shown by rectangles (helices) and arrows (\u03b2-strands). SUD-NM was reported to form a dimer in the single crystals used for X-ray structure determination, with a disulfide bond joining the SUD-N and SUD-M domains within each subunit, in addition to the backbone link between these domains. 17 In contrast, we found that SUD-NM is monomeric in solution. The monomeric state is clearly apparent from the NMR data, as the 2D 15 N, 1 H HSQC spectrum (Fig. 4 , red peaks) would be inconsistent with a molecular size of 60 kDa. Independently, size-exclusion chromatography showed that the protein eluted at an apparent molecular mass of 35 kDa, which fits closely with its monomeric size (Fig. 5b) . Based on the similarity of the correlation peaks ( Fig. 4) , we conclude that the globular structures of SUD-N and SUD-M are conserved in the SUD-NM construct. Furthermore, SUD-N and SUD-M are flexibly connected with each other, as evidenced by the close similarity of the peak positions and peak shapes of the isolated domains and the SUD-NM construct (Fig. 4) . Since the resonances of SUD-N have been identified as a group, but not individually assigned, the peaks of the 15 N-1 H moieties of residues 525-526, which form the interdomain linker, had to be assigned by exclusion. There is one 15 N-1 H correlation peak (identified in Fig. 4b and d) that has no counterpart in the spectra of the individual domains and was therefore tentatively assigned to the linker peptide segment. This is one of about 20 peaks in SUD-NM that exhibit 15 N{ 1 H} NOE values smaller than 0.6 ( Fig. S1 ), thus indicating that there is increased mobility in parts of SUD-N and in the linker peptide when compared to the bulk of either of the two globular domains.",

SUD-M does not enter the polyacrylamide gel due to its basic pI (calculated pI = 9.0); therefore, complex formation is inferred by the decrease in free RNA at a 10:1 protein/RNA ratio (Fig. 6c) . SUD-MC has a pI value that is close to neutral (calculated pI = 6.7) and does not enter the gel, but its (GGGA) 5 complex is sufficiently stable and has enough negative charge to enter the gel and to be observed as a discrete band ( Fig. 6b and e) . In contrast, the acidic SUD-C (calculated pI = 5.0) does enter the gel, as shown by the protein staining in Fig.  6h , but we do not observe significant RNA staining at the corresponding position (Fig. 6g ) and thus conclude that SUD-C does not bind to (GGGA) 5 under the assay conditions used.

This is also the case for the new domain structure presented in this work, SUD-C, which has a fold that is named after the N-terminal domain of CyaY, a member of the frataxin family of metal-binding proteins involved in iron homeostasis. 26, 27 Despite the structural similarity, there is only a 10% sequence identity between SUD-C and CyaY, including that only one of the eight residues believed to be involved in iron binding by CyaY is conserved in SUD-C. This makes it unlikely that SUD-C performs the same function. A search of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the program Dali 28, 29 identified several additional structural homologues with Z-scores of \u22644.4 (Table S1 ). These include anthrax edema factor, 30 which has adenylate cyclase activity, and AcsD, which is an adenylating enzyme of which SUD-C resembles the N-terminal dimerization domain. 31 Similar to the comparison with CyaY, SUD-C lacks any apparent conservation of the active-site residues of these proteins; therefore, the observation that two different adenylate-binding enzymes have SUD-C-like folds does not appear to provide a new lead toward the as yet unknown SUD-C function. Among the structural homologues of SUD-C (Table  S1 ), there are also small protein domains that perform regulatory functions for DNA-modifying enzymes. Examples are the N-terminal domain of DNA primase, which is a zinc-binding domain that is responsible for DNA binding and also regulates the activity of the catalytic domain of the enzyme, 32 and double-wing motif DNA-binding proteins such as YjbR and MotA. 33, 34 Although the key DNA-binding residues are in no case conserved in SUD-C, it is interesting that other proteins with SUD-C-like folds bind nucleic acids, especially when considering that nucleic acids were observed to copurify with recombinant SUD-C expressed in Escherichia coli (see Materials and Methods).",

The NMR structure determination of SUD-MC in solution further reveals that the short linker peptide segment of residues 652-654 between SUD-M and SUD-C allows nearly unrestricted freedom of movement of the two domains relative to each other (Fig. 2) , with no evidence for a preferred interdomain orientation detected by the methods used. Similarly, solution studies of the construct SUD-NM, for which crystal structure determination has recently been presented, 17 indicate extensive freedom of motion of SUD-N and SUD-M relative to each other. SUD-NM is monomeric in solution (Fig. 5) , contrasting with the observation of a dimeric form in the crystal structure. 17 The observed flexible linkage of the two domains further indicates that an interdomain disulfide bond that has been reported to link SUD-N and SUD-M in the crystal structure is not present in the reducing solvent milieu used for the NMR studies. Since the eukaryotic cell cytoplasm, where the SUD is expected to be located, 10,25 also presents a reducing milieu, 35 it would appear that the monomeric sulfhydryl form observed in solution, with flexibly linked SUD-N and SUD-M domains, might be closely related to the physiologically relevant form of the protein. There are no significant chemical shift perturbations that would indicate tight transient or static contacts between the two domains, and the SUD-NM 15 N-1 H correlation NMR signals have linewidths narrower than one expects for a compact globular domain with a molecular mass of 29.6 kDa. In view of these observations, the following discussion on nucleic acid binding and on the possible physiological roles of the SUD will be based on an SUD molecular model containing three flexibly linked globular domains.",

This shows that the binding surface of SUD-C does not have the characteristics of a typical RNA binding site, since besides two positively charged residues, of which the histidine in position 658 has the largest perturbation (Fig. 8d) , there are also several negatively charged amino acid side chains (Fig. 9e) . In SUD-MC, the \u0394\u03b4 values of SUD-C residues at a 1:1 A 10 /protein ratio (Fig. 8c) are significantly increased relative to those of the isolated SUD-C. The presence of SUD-M in SUD-MC thus stabilizes SUD-C-RNA interactions, indicating that the coordinated binding of the linked domains might reduce the repulsion of RNA due to the negative surface charge of SUD-C (Fig. 9d) . A putative binding site on SUD-C in SUD-MC is indicated by the fact that the largest \u0394\u03b4 values were seen for H658, H695, T696, E702, G707, and V709 (Fig. 9c) . Except for H658 in helix \u03b11, these residues are all in strands \u03b25, \u03b26, and \u03b27 of the \u03b2sheet (Fig. 1) , or in loops joining these strands, and the set of residues with large \u0394\u03b4 values is somewhat smaller but nonetheless clearly similar to that seen for RNA binding to the isolated SUD-C (Fig. 9e) .",

It thus appears that coordinated action of the two domains in SUD-MC results in greater specificity of RNA binding by SUD-MC than by SUD-M, and may thus lead to binding interactions that are unique to SUD-MC. For example, SUD-MC binds to SARS-CoV TRS(+) (5\u2032-CUAAACGAAC-3\u2032) and to its reverse complement in the anti-genome, TRS(\u2212) (5\u2032-GUUCGUUUAG-3\u2032) (Fig. 6b) . NMR chemical shift perturbations (data not shown) were larger in the presence of TRS(+) than in the presence of TRS(\u2212), and localized to the same site of SUD-M in SUD-MC that was previously identified for A 10 binding (Fig. 9a) . However, in contrast to A 10 binding (Fig. 8a-c) , there was minimal contact of SUD-C with TRS. Since the isolated SUD-M did not bind either to TRS(+) or to TRS(\u2212), this shows that the SUD-C in SUD-MC modifies binding without being directly involved in the ligand interaction. Since TRS(+) and TRS(\u2212) contain six and four purine residues, respectively, the aforementioned larger shift perturbations by TRS(+) again seem to reflect the preference of SUD for purine binding. Poly-A is found at the 3\u2032-end of the viral RNA genome, and these interactions could thus indicate a role for SUD-MC in viral genome or subgenomic RNA transcription.",

Addition of (GGA) 4 resulted in broadening of SUD-M resonance linewidths in SUD-MC with increasing RNA/protein ratio. Thus, at a (GGA) 4 /protein ratio of 0.5:1, most peaks of SUD-M were broadened beyond detection at the contour levels shown in Fig. S2 , whereas those of SUD-C were nearly unaffected. For GGGAGGGAGG binding with SUD-MC, a similar pattern of line broadening was observed at a 1:1 RNA/protein ratio, and both (GGA) 4 and GGGAGGGAGG caused precipitation when added to SUD-M. Eventually, chemical shift perturbations in SUD-MC and SUD-M were measurable only for (GGA) 4 at a 0.2:1 RNA/protein ratio, where the binding of (GGA) 4 involves the same surface residues (Fig. S2c and d) as previously observed for A 10 binding (Fig. 9a) . In all of these experiments, SUD-C NMR signals showed neither sizeable chemical shift perturbations nor line broadening (Fig. S2a-c and e) . We speculate that this indicates the formation of high-molecular-mass aggregates characterized by binding of SUD-M to RNA, with the NMR signals of the flexibly linked SUD-C only minimally affected by this process. These aggregates would involve multiple SUD-MC proteins binding via their SUD-M to the same RNA. Similar to conclusions from the data in Figs. 6-8, in this interpretation, SUD-C would again appear to regulate the specificity of SUD-MC for RNA binding without direct contacts with the ligand, which may be physiologically important in directing the protein only to certain viral or host cell RNA sequences.",

For example, the human macrodomain ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 2 (GDAP2), which is implicated in neuronal differentiation and expressed during brain development, does not bind to poly-ADP-ribose or hydrolyze ADPR-1\u2033-phosphate, but does recognize poly-A RNA. 36 Since we and others have shown that neither SUD-M 16 nor SUD-NM 17 binds to monomeric ADP-ribose, the substrate specificity of SUD appears to be similar to that of GDAP2. No sequence similarity between GDAP2 and SUD-M was detected by BLAST, but a pairwise alignment with FFAS 37 identified about a 15% sequence identity.",

Since the fifth globular domain of nsp3, nsp3e, which is separated from SUD-MC in the nsp3 sequence by a papain-like protease (Fig. 10) , also binds to G-containing and A-containing RNAs, 25 there is also the possibility of a longer-range concerted action with SUD-MC in RNA recognition. Physiologically, this increased specificity is likely to be important in directing nsp3 activity to the desired RNA sequences; binding to a broader range of RNA sequences, as observed for the isolated SUD-M, might affect host cell viability and thus reduce the ability of the virus to replicate.",

SUD-M was previously shown to bind to poly-A RNA, which might relate to a possible function in initiating negative strand synthesis by binding to poly-A tails of the viral genome. 16 It has also been proposed that due to its affinity for G-quadruplexes, SUD-NM could bind to G-quadruplex-containing host cell mRNAs encoding proteins involved in cellular signaling pathways, which could lead to disruption of the host cell environment and could favor viral replication. 17 When we tested (GGGA) 5 binding to SUD-MC in KCl buffer, which favors the formation of G-quadruplexes, the binding was much weaker than that in saline buffer (Fig. 7) , which would argue against a G-quadruplex being the actual molecular structure recognized by SUD-MC. We note, however, that several of the G-rich RNA sequences displayed multiple bands on native gels (Figs. 6 and 7) , which may be due to the presence of different secondary structures, suggesting that variable types of folded RNA structure could indeed be recognized or induced by the interaction with the protein. In the following, we investigate the occurrence of alternative oligopurine sequences in SARS-CoV genomes that could function as additional SUD binding sites.",

Of these eight conserved G 4 sequences, all but one are unique to SARS-CoV, and if these sequences were indeed physiologically relevant substrates for SUD-MC, this would be consistent with the finding that SUD is unique to SARS-CoV. An additional search for the GGGAGG-GAGG sequence in the SARS-CoV Tor2 genome did not result in an exact hit, but we found three nucleotide segments that differed only by one base: nt 1461-1470 on the (+) strand in the nsp2 coding region have the sequence 5\u2032-GGGAGGUAGG-3\u2032; nt 12723-12732 on the (+) strand in the nsp12 coding region have the sequence 5\u2032-GGGAGGUAGG-3\u2032; and nt 25383-25392 on the (\u2212) strand have the sequence 5\u2032-GGGAGUGAGG-3\u2032.

In contrast, the sequence on the (\u2212) strand is not highly conserved among SARS strains.
