Here, A9, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI) of the tyrphostin class, is identified as a robust inhibitor of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection in cell-based assays. Moreover, A9 exhibited potent antiviral activity against the replication of various CoVs, including murine hepatitis virus (MHV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). We further performed a comparative phosphoproteomic analysis to investigate the mechanism of action of A9 against TGEV infection in vitro. We specifically identified p38 and JNK1, which are the downstream molecules of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) required for efficient TGEV replication, as A9 targets through plaque assays, qRT-PCR and Western blotting assays. p38 and JNK1 inhibitors and RNA interference further showed that the inhibitory activity of A9 against TGEV infection was mainly mediated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. All these findings indicated that the RTKI A9 directly inhibits TGEV replication and that its inhibitory activity against TGEV replication mainly occurs by targeting p38, which provides vital clues to the design of novel drugs against CoVs.",

The CoV genome is currently the largest known viral RNA genome, with a total length of 28-30 kb. CoVs consist of four genera: Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and a tentative new genus, Deltacoronavirus (de Groot et al., 2012) . CoVs commonly cause gastroenteric or respiratory diseases in animal hosts as well as in humans. Given that there are currently no approved vaccines or antiviral strategies for many pathogenic CoVs (Ramajayam et al., 2010) , it is increasingly important to identify broad-spectrum antiviral compounds. These compounds will promote quick responses to threats of new or changing pandemics, possibly even without accurate identification of the agents.",

TGEV causes fatal acute diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration, with mortality rates of nearly 100% in suckling piglets less than 2 weeks old (Pritchard et al., 1999) , resulting in severe economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. Approximately two-thirds of the 5\u2032-proximal region of the TGEV genome encodes the replicase gene (rep), which contains two open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b). Polyprotein 1a (pp1a) and polyprotein 1 ab (pp1ab) are translated by rep (Gorbalenya et al., 2006) and are proteolytically processed by virus-encoded proteases into 16 non-structural proteins (nsps), nsps 1-16, many of which have enzymatic activities, such as papain-like protease (PLP or nsp3), 3C-like protease (3CL), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, nsp12) helicase (nsp13). These nsps along with putative cellular factors are believed to form replication/transcription complexes, which play an important role in CoV RNA transcription and replication (Neuman et al., 2014) . As the crystal structures of a large number of viral nonstructural and structural proteins have been solved, targeted drug design has been attempted (Tong, 2009) . Unfortunately, such efforts have not led to advances in antiviral drugs beyond the preclinical stage (Hilgenfeld and Peiris, 2013) . Overall, this target-based approach ignores other possible targets, including host cell signaling pathways or other host factors that are essential for CoV replication. Furthermore, RNA viral genomes typically replicate with low fidelity and undergo rapid evolutionary changes. Thus, targeting cellular factors involved in virus infection provides an excellent strategy for drug development because such treatment is not easily evaded by the high mutation rates in viral genomes (Zhou et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "Protein kinases and phosphatases involve a wide variety of cellular functions. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are a group of growth factor receptors and key components of the biological control networks that regulate many biological processes including cell proliferation and differentiation as well as survival (Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010) . RTKs also play an important role in transforming extracellular and intracellular signals and activating or linking them to downstream signaling pathways, such as the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), PI3K/Akt, and JAK/STAT pathways (Pawson, 1995; Schlessinger, 2000) . As RTKs are both master regulators of normal cellular processes and play a vital role in the development and progression of various cancers, they have been extensively studied as targets for the treatment of many types of malignancies (Roussidis and Karamanos, 2002) . Recently, a growing number of studies has shown that several RTKs and other tyrosine kinases are involved in viral replication. For example, the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL can function as an entry factor for dengue virus and Zika virus (ZIKV) (Meertens et al., 2012; Meertens et al., 2017) . In addition, the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein was shown to block the replication of type-1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), and arenaviruses (Stantchev et al., 2007; Vela et al., 2008; Yura et al., 1993) . PTP1B, the protein tyrosine phosphatase was also shown to be a target for antiviral therapy (Carbone et al., 2012) . Imatinib, an Abelson (Abl) kinase inhibitor, was shown to be a potent inhibitor of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in vitro (Dyall et al., 2014) . Two RTK inhibitors (RTKIs), known as AG879 and tyrphostin A9, can block multiple steps of influenza A virus replication, but both the underlying mechanism of this inhibitory effect and its target are unclear (Kumar et al., 2011a; Kumar et al., 2011b) . The Raf/MEK/ERK pathways downstream of RTKs are involved in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) RNA synthesis (Cai et al., 2007) , and a recent study indicated that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a promoter for TGEV entry (Hu et al., 2016) .",

We identified tyrphostin A9 (A9), a specific RTKI, as having a strong antiviral activity against TGEV. In addition, A9 appears to be a broad-spectrum CoV inhibitor, as it blocked the replication of MHV, PEDV and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) with comparable efficacy. Furthermore, we employed both pharmacological inhibitors and RNA interference to demonstrate that A9 dramatically suppresses viral replication and viral RNA synthesis mainly through the p38 signaling pathway. Our findings provide molecular insight into the potential role of host RTK signaling pathways in promoting the replication of CoVs and suggest that tyrphostin A9 could be developed as a potential anti-CoV therapy.",

Ribavirin has previously been reported to inhibit MERS-CoV replication (Falzarano et al., 2013) and was thus used as a positive control. Compared to the DMSO control, flunarizine and ribavirin were not cytotoxic in PK-15 cells at concentrations up to 10 \u03bcM and 90 \u03bcM, respectively (Fig. 1B) . Subsequent MTT assays showed no cytotoxicity up to 6 \u03bcM A9 (Fig. 1D ). To compare antiviral potencies, PK-15 cells were infected with TGEV at an MOI of 0.1 and then treated with DMSO or compounds at various concentrations, and the virus yield in the supernatants was determined at 36 hpi ( Fig. 1C and E). Compared to the vehicle control (DMSO), both A9 and ribavirin displayed dose-dependent inhibitory activities against TGEV in PK-15 cells. No inhibition was observed by treating cells with 10 \u03bcM flunarizine, a concentration that was not cytotoxic. Note that the strong viral inhibition produced by flunarizine at 30 \u03bcM and A9 at 10 \u03bcM might be due to cytotoxicity at those concentrations (Fig. 1C) . Based on the cytotoxicity and antiviral efficacy results, we chose A9 at 4 \u03bcM for further evaluation in this study. Taken together, these initial studies identified A9 as a specific RTKI that can strongly suppress the TGEV yield.",

Both PK-15 and ST cells were treated with A9 or vehicle control (DMSO) and infected with TGEV at an MOI of 0.01, 0.1, or 1. As peaks of TGEV replication at different MOIs were observed at various time points, the viral yield in the supernatants was quantified at 48 h (MOI = 0.01), 24 h (MOI = 0.1), or 12 h (MOI = 1) post infection. As shown in Fig. 2A and B, A9 strongly inhibited TGEV production in the two cell lines and at all tested virus-to-cell ratios, although some variation between the cell types was observed. In addition, a 1 to > 4 log decrease in infectious progeny was observed in the A9 treatment group compared to that of the DMSO treatment control. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the inhibition of TGEV replication by A9 is not limited to a single cell type and is effective even with relatively high levels of input virus. Compared with its behavior in ST cells, A9 displayed greater inhibition against TGEV in PK-15 cells. One explanation for this difference may be that A9 uptake differs per cell line.",

TGEV infected PK-15 cells were treated with DMSO as a control. The titer of infectious viral particles in the supernatant at 24 hpi was measured by plaque assays. When added at either 4\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C during (0 h) virus infection, A9 displayed relatively slight inhibitory activity against the TGEV infection (Fig. 2D ), suggesting that A9 has a low effect on virus binding and entry. In addition, there was no significant decrease in virus yield compared to the DMSO-treated control when A9 was added before TGEV attachment. Interestingly, when A9 was added 1 h post TGEV infection, the virus yields were reduced by more than 3 logs. These findings indicated that A9 mainly blocks the post-adsorption stage of the TGEV life cycle. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of A9 is likely exerted through cellular mechanisms rather than directly by reducing virion infectivity.",

PK-15 cells were subjected to four different experiments: mock control (untreated), A9 treated, TGEV-infected PK-15 cells (TGEV-infected), and TGEV infection with A9 treatment (TGEV/A9). After the three biological replicates were combined, a total of 868 phosphosites corresponding to 569 phosphorylated proteins were identified in the phosphoproteomic analysis among all groups (n = 3 for each group), of which 444 phosphorylated proteins were quantified (Table S1 ). The proteins that met the criteria of a p < 0.05 and fold-change ratios \u22651.5 or \u22640.667 were considered differentially regulated phosphoproteins (DRPs). Of the 444 phosphoproteins, 12 phosphoproteins were significantly upregulated and 5 were downregulated in the TGEV-infected group relative to those in the untreated control ( Fig. S1A and Table S2 ). Among the 12 proteins with a > 1.5-fold increase over the proteome background, 55.55% are nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins ( Fig. S1B and Table S3 ). Moreover, the levels of phosphorylated MAPK14/p38 and MAPK8/JNK1 were significantly upregulated (by > 10-fold and by > 3-fold, respectively) without any change in overall protein expression in TGEV infected samples compared with that in the mock control ( Fig. S1B and Table S3 ). In contrast, A9 treatment reduced p38 and JNK1 phosphorylation in TGEV-infected PK-15 cells (Fig. S1 C and Table S3 ). Treatment with A9 alone did not affect the overall expression or phosphorylation status of p38 and JNK1 relative to the untreated control (Table S2) . Surprisingly, comparison of the A9-treated group and mock control group showed that the phosphorylation statuses of multiple proteins markedly increased with A9 treatment, including elongation factor Tu (TUFM), 28S ribosomal protein S7 (MRPS7), LETM1, EF-hand domain-containing protein 1 and Delta-like protein (JAG1). In addition, the phospho-signaling of fourteen proteins decreased significantly in the A9-treated PK-15 cells compared with that in the untreated control cells (Fig. S1A and Table S2 ).

Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test (**, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). was assessed. As shown in Fig. S2A and Table S4 , proteins exhibiting differential phosphorylation after A9 treatment are associated with various biological processes, including cell growth, energy pathway, cell communication, protein metabolism and signal transduction. We then investigated the pathways affected by TGEV infection and subsequent A9 treatment. The results indicated that the activity of several kinase-mediated signaling pathways was increased ( Fig. S2A and Table  S4 ); these pathways included EGFR1, IL-2-mediated signaling events and MAPK pathways. We also utilized Motif-X online software (Version 1.2, http://motif-x.med.harvard.edu/) to assess the enrichment of significant motif substrates after A9 treatment, which resulted in the identification of three tyrosine-based phosphorylation motif sequences: YXXXR, KXXXXY, and YXXXXK. According to the results, the most significantly phosphorylated amino acid is tyrosine followed by threonine, YxxxRxx is also the most significant kinase motif, which is consistent with the properties of A9 as an inhibitor of RTKs ( Fig. S2B and Table S5 ). Furthermore, two phospho-motifs, YXXXR and KXXXXY, were enriched during TGEV infection ( Fig. S3B and Table S5 ), indicating that the most significantly phosphorylated amino acid during TGEV infection is tyrosine. The motifs identified above are found in many protein kinase and MAPK family substrates. In addition, TP is the only enriched threonine motif, and it is a substrate that commonly binds to the GSK-3, ERK1, ERK2, and CDK5 kinases ( Fig. S3A and Table  S5 ). The motif analysis along with the results of overrepresentation of phosphoproteins predicted to be substrates of MAPK support an increase in p38 and JNK1 activity during TGEV infection. A protein network related to TGEV/A9-regulated phosphoproteins was assembled by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, versions 1.0 to 4.0), and 57 of the DRPs were recognized and mapped in the predicted network ( Fig. S2C and Table S6 ). MAPK families, especially p38 (MAPK14) and JNK1 (MAPK8), were found to be important nodes that interact with many other proteins and were predicted to play important roles in the interaction network, and their phosphorylation levels were increased and then decreased during TGEV infection and subsequent A9 treatment mentioned above. This interaction network offers clues for further elucidation of the pathogenic mechanism of TGEV.",

Nevertheless, no studies to date have focused on detecting global phosphorylation events in host cells during CoV infection. A9 is an RTKI and we hypothesized that its antiviral effect is most likely its influence on the phosphorylation of molecules downstream of RTKs in cells, which is required for viral replication. In this study, we applied quantitative phosphoproteome analysis to assess changes in cellular phosphoproteins involved in the host response to TGEV infection; 569 phosphoproteins from PK-15 cells and three viral proteins (matrix protein, spike glycoprotein and nucleoprotein) were identified (Table  S1 ). Motif analysis suggested that the most significantly phosphorylated amino acid during TGEV infection is tyrosine (Fig. S3B) , which is consistent with A9 acting as an inhibitor of RTK to inhibit the replication of TGEV. Several CoV N proteins have been shown to be phosphorylated and the phosphorylated sites for TGEV, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and MHV N proteins have been identified (Calvo et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2005; White et al., 2007) . Chen and colleagues reported that phosphorylated IBV N protein presented a higher affinity for viral RNA than for nonviral RNA (Chen et al., 2005) . Phosphorylation also plays an important role in the immunoreactivity and specificity of the SARS N protein (Shin et al., 2007) . The phosphorylation status of the IBV N protein has the greatest impact on initiating the rescue of infectious virus from cDNA (Spencer et al., 2008) . Phosphorylation modification is a unique strategy for CoV N to facilitate the synthesis of longer viral RNAs and subsequent viral progeny production, through the recruitment of cellular DDX1 (Wu et al., 2014) . However, the function of the phosphorylated CoV N protein in viral pathogenesis is unknown, and further investigation is needed to determine whether the spike glycoprotein and matrix protein could be phosphorylated during CoV infection as well as the mechanism(s) by which coronaviral protein phosphorylation functions in viral replication. This study is the first to reveal global phosphorylation events in PK-15 cells induced by TGEV infection using quantitative phosphoproteomics and may therefore provide a basis for better understanding the molecular mechanisms of TGEV pathogenesis in addition to assisting in the development of antiviral drugs targeting TGEV.",

            "text": "phosphorylation of p38 and JNK1 by more than 10-fold and 3-fold, respectively, in TGEV-infected cells compared to that in untreated control cells ( Fig. 4A and B, Fig. S1B and Table S2 ). In addition, p38 and JNK1 were not activated in PK-15 cells exposed to UV-inactivated TGEV (data not shown). These results indicate that activation of p38 and JNK MAPK is due to the actual replication of the virus in cells. However, tyrphostin A9 treatment can block TGEV-induced p38 and JNK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4C and D and E and Table S2 ), indicating that p38 and JNK MAP kinase function downstream of RTKs. We further explored the effects of the downstream mediators of RTKs, p38 and JNK1, on TGEV replication using the specific inhibitors BIRB796 and DB07268, respectively. Our results showed that pretreatment with both BIRB796 and DB07268 significantly reduced TGEV N mRNA and protein levels ( Fig. 5C and D) , with a lower TGEV titer ( Fig. 5A and B) , compared to DMSO-treated control cells. We speculate that the inhibitory activity of A9 against TGEV replication might target multiple host kinases downstream of RTKs. RTKs are the primary mediators of many signals and control many downstream cascades, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), MAPK and Ca2 + pathways (Schlessinger, 2000) . Several studies have shown that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling and STAT3 cascades, which are downstream of RTKs, play important roles in the life cycle of CoV (Hu et al., 2016; Kindrachuk et al., 2015; Mizutani et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2018) . Further studies are required to explore whether these downstream cascades are involved in the inhibitory activity of A9 against TGEV replication. To the extent that A9 might target multiple host components, drug-resistant viral variants are less likely to occur (Kumar et al., 2011a) . Our results showed that the inhibitory effect of DB07268 on virus propagation was relatively weaker than that of BIRB796 (Fig. 5) . Such a correlation suggests that A9 mainly inhibited the replication of TGEV through the p38 pathway. We also used another p38 inhibitor to validate its essential regulatory role in TGEV infection, and the results were consistent with those of BIRB796, which can significantly reduce TGEV replication (Fig. 5E and F) . We also performed RNA interference to further validate that p38 plays an important regulatory role in TGEV replication ( Fig. 6A and B) . As the level of p38 expression was reduced to only 41% (Fig. 6A) , residual p38 would still be phosphorylated during TGEV infection and promote virus replication. Moreover, other pathways also play a role in TGEV replication during A9 treatment, such as the JNK signaling pathway (Figs. 4 and 5) . Therefore, the inhibitory effect of p38 siRNA was not as strong as the effect of the p38 inhibitor on viral replication. Furthermore, the specificities of A9 were tested in wild type and p38-knockdown cells with TGEV infection. Interestingly, the inhibitory activity of A9 against TGEV in p38-knockdown cells was similar to that of NC siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 6C ). All our results suggest that the inhibition of A9 on TGEV replication is mainly via targeting p38.",

            "text": "MAPKs are important cellular signaling molecules that regulate cell growth, apoptosis, metabolism and differentiation under both normal and pathological conditions. The well characterized MAPKs are composed of three major groups: extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2, also known as p42/44 MAPK), p38 MAP kinases and JNKs (Schaeffer and Weber, 1999) . The p38 MAPK pathway can be activated by a variety of CoVs and plays a crucial role in CoV infection. It has been reported that PEDV infection activates p38 MAPK and JNK1/2 and can exploit these molecules for optimal replication (Lee et al., 2016) . Additionally, MHV infection activates p38 MAPK and JNK, which is necessary for its replication (Banerjee et al., 2002) . Activation of p38 MAPK by FIPV regulates pro-inflammatory cytokine production which is a key contributor to the pathological changes observed in cats with FIP (Regan et al., 2009) . p38 MAPK activation is required for human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E) replication and chloroquine inhibits HCoV-229E replication may by suppressing p38 activation (Kono et al., 2008) . Our findings showed that A9 mainly inhibits TGEV replication through the p38 pathway. Moreover, A9 inhibited infectious PEDV, MHV and FIPV replication with similar potencies. Hence, it is reasonable to speculate that A9 may inhibit the replication of other CoVs by the same mechanism. Similar to other findings, tyrphostin A9 treatment inhibited gp120-induced p38 phosphorylation (Anand et al., 2009) . Although the effect of p38 MAPK on viral replication has been studied in a variety of viruses, little is known about the mechanisms by which p38 activation facilitates virus replication. The author of one study discussed that stimulation of p38 MAPK may enhance the transcription of specific viral gene promoters, leading to the promotion of herpes simplex virus type 1 proliferation (Zachos et al., 2001) . In MHV, p38 MAPK activation results in the phosphorylation of eIF4E, which facilitates virus protein synthesis and the subsequent production of infectious virus (Banerjee et al., 2002) . Cencic et al. reported that targeting the eIF4F complex is a strategy for blocking CoV infection (Cencic et al., 2011) . eIF4E is a downstream molecule of p38 MAPK and Fig. 6 . p38 is one of the targets for the inhibitory activity of A9 against TGEV replication. (A) The efficiency of p38 siRNA was evaluated by Western blotting. PK-15 cells in 12-well plates were transfected with the indicated siRNA at 80 pmol using transfection reagent. At 48 h post transfection, the cells were lysed and subjected to Western blotting with an antibody against p38. Protein levels were quantified with ImageJ software and normalized to the amount of GAPDH. (B) Knock down of p38 expression with siRNA inhibited TGEV replication at 12 hpi. PK-15 cells in 12-well plates were transfected with p38 siRNA and NC siRNA at 80 pmol, respectively. At 48 h post transfection, the cells were infected with 0.1 MOI TGEV. Virus yield in supernatants of the cultures were measured at different time points using the plaque assay. (C) The effects of downregulating p38 MAPK on the inhibitory activity of A9 against TGEV replication. PK-15 cells were transfected with p38 siRNA or NC siRNA for 48 h, and then treated with 0.1 MOI TGEV and A9 for 12 h. Cells treated with TGEV and DMSO at 48 h post transfection were used as controls. Virus yield in the supernatants of the cultures was detected by plaque assay. The data shown are mean of three independent experiments (B and C).

A9, an inhibitor of RTKs, initiates a signaling cascade that involves phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase, in turn inhibiting the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK1, which are activated by TGEV infection; the result is a robust decrease in TGEV replication. In conclusion, although the signaling intermediates between TGEV and RTK remain to be elucidated, we identified and validated that p38 MAPK is a main downstream signaling node for the inhibitory activity of A9 against TGEV replication. The findings reported here provide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying TGEV replication and offer new and promising therapeutic possibilities for combating infections caused by CoV. In summary, our findings show that TGEV infection can stimulate p38 and JNK1 phosphorylation and that A9 treatment can attenuate this phosphorylation status, which results in decreased TGEV replication. There has been significant progress in both clinical and preclinical studies of RTKIs as anti-cancer therapy in recent years, which may promote the development of such compounds for use in antiviral therapy.",
