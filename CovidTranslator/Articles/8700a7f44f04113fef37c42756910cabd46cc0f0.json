            "text": "Absorption of water and electrolytes by the small and large intestine was examined using a nonabsorbable marker technique in 3-day-old and 3-wkold pigs. One-half of the pigs in each group were orally infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus; the remaining pigs served as controls. Threeday-old control pigs concentrated the nonabsorbable fluid marker twelvefold along the small and large intestine, indicating an efficiency of about 95% in absorption of the exogenous daily fluid load presented to the intestine. In contrast, the marker concentration in infected pigs showed no change whatsoever along either the small or large intestine, indicating a complete absence of net fluid absorption or secretion in these animals. Three-week-old control pigs concentrated the marker similarly to the 3-day-old group, with the bulk of the fluid absorption occurring in the small intestine. Infected pigs in the 3-wk-old group had marked net fluid secretion in the proximal small intestine, so that about twice the fluid load was presented to the large intestine of the 3-wk-old infected pigs as compared to the 3-day-old infected group. However, in contrast to the 3-day-old infected group, the large intestine of the 3-wk-old infected pigs increased fluid absorption some six times over the control, and this compensatory response prevented diarrhea in these older animals. Analysis of luminal contents indicated that in the older pigs, unabsorbed carbohydrate was almost completely fermented to short-chain fatty acids in the colon, whereas in the younger pigs the carbohydrate passed through the colon unchanged. These results demonstrate that development of microbial digestion, together with rapid short-chain fatty acid absorption, is a primary feature responsible for the colonic compensation in the older pigs with transmissible gastroenteritis.",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is a coronavirus infection of absorptive epithelial cells in the small intestine of pigs. The disease is characterized by atrophy of intestinal villi and acute diarrhea. Swine of all ages are susceptible to this infection. The case fatality rate approaches 100% in pigs that become infected during the first week after birth; however, it is comparatively low (:::;2%) in pigs that become infected when they are older (2:3 wk old). Villous atrophy and diarrhea are less severe and of shorter duration in older pigs than in newborn pigs. The reason for this age-dependent resistance is unclear; it has been ascribed, however, at least in part, to an accelerated rate of epithelial cell replacement in older pigs (1) (2) (3) . Normal newborn pigs require three times as long as normal 3-wk-old pigs to replace villous absorptive cells (4) . The comparatively shortlived villous absorptive cells of older pigs also tend to produce lower titers of TGE virus than those in newborn pigs. Villous absorptive cells destroyed by TGE virus are replaced by cells that migrate from the crypts before they are completely differentiated. Crypt epithelium and the incompletely differentiated cells covering atrophic villi are resistant to attack by the TGE virus (2, 3, 5) .",

On the day of necropsy, the daily feedings were divided into eight equal GASTROENTEROLOGY Vol. 86, No.6 portions and fed at hourly intervals for 3 h and at 30-min intervals for a remaining 2 h. Although Hamilton and Roe (11) had established that a relatively constant concentration of PEG was obtained by 5 h with this schedule by means of a fistula near the ligament of Treitz, it was questioned whether or not steady-state marker conditions would be obtained throughout the digestive tract, especially in the more distal segments. We define the steady state as a constant perfusion of PEG in amount (CV) per unit time (t) throughout the digestive tract, where C is PEG concentration and Vis volume flow. Then, CjV/t = CoValt, where i and 0 refer to the input and output, respectively, to any segment of the digestive tract. Therefore, the flow rate past a sampling point is Volt = Cj V/Cot. These conditions imply that in the steady state, C and V must be constant in any given segment as a function of time. In order to test the assumption that relatively stable PEG concentrations were obtained in each segment, preliminary experiments were conducted with control pigs of each age group. These pigs were fed their meals according to the above schedule and were necropsied in groups of three at 3, 4, 5, and 6 h following the initial morning feeding. This procedure permitted examination of the change in marker concentrations with time in various segments of the bowel. These studies showed that relatively constant marker concentrations were established by 5 h in all segments of the tract examined (see Results), and, therefore, 5 h appeared sufficient to approximate steady-state conditions in the main experiment. The constancy of V is only assumed, but appears reasonable in view of the small, frequent feedings.",

This latter effect appeared to be the result of dilution of the hypertonic gastric contents with a hypotonic fluid, the osmolality of which can be calculated to be ~185 mosmoliL. Thus, these results in the small intestine are consistent with the hypothesis of small bowel malabsorption and fluid accumulation as a result of osmotic forces; however, an active secretory process by the small intestine cannot be entirely ruled out.",

First, it is possible that in the young pigs there may be a defect in colonic transport mechanisms caused directly by the virus. However, this seems unlikely because the virus does not invade epithelial cells or cause histologic changes in the large intestine. Furthermore, a significant fraction of the osmotic activity entering and leaving the colon of these young pigs was in the form of carbohydrate (presumably lactose) which, as such, cannot be absorbed by the colonic mucosa.",

There is now evidence that, in fact, active Na absorption by in vitro pig colonic mucosa reaches very high and near maximal rates by day 1 of life due to high aldosterone secretion rates at this time (18, 19) . Therefore, it is unlikely that the transport capacity of this tissue represents a limiting factor in colonic absorption. However, the colon of these younger pigs is proportionally much smaller in size than in older pigs and the possibility of total surface area or transit time as a limiting factor needs to be explored. Nevertheless, the same argument can be invoked as with the first alternative; namely, a major proportion of the con- GASTROENTEROLOGY Vol. 86.

            "text": "Finally, a most likely explanation of the differences in function concerns carbohydrate metabolism by colonic bacteria. In fact, it is precisely an overactive bacterial fermentation of carbohydrate to shortchain organic acids that has been postulated as being responsible for luminal acidification and osmotic diarrhea involving the colon; i.e., fermentative diarrhea (9) . Fermentation of carbohydrate did produce a degree of acidification and high levels of organic acids in the older pigs, and in the case of the older infected pigs, a proportion of this was in the form of D-and L-lactic acid. If the feed intake had not been restricted, it is likely that large amounts of lactic acid and acidification of the contents would have resulted in an osmotic diarrhea. However, under these experimental conditions, colonic absorption in the older pigs was unimpaired. Thus, the evidence suggests the alternative hypothesis; namely, that the fermentation process itself is the rate-limiting factor in reducing the osmotic load in the younger pigs. A similar conclusion was reached in human studies involving carbohydrate infusions into the intact colon (20) . Figure 8 summarizes the flow of carbohydrate in grams per day into and out of the large intestine together with the amount of carbohydrate disappearing from the colon, presumably fermented to SCF A. Also shown in parentheses is the number of :milliosmoles per day entering and leaving the large intestine that were not accounted for by the product (Na + K) x 2. This osmotic fraction would presumably include carbohydrate and peptides. This fraction was calculated for individual pigs instead of the pooled result for carbohydrate and, thus, may be a more accurate description of unabsorbed carbohydrate. In addition, these values are shown for only the 5 pigs with villous atrophy in the 3-wk-old infected group, whereas the pooled carbohydrate sample includes all pigs.",

            "text": "Clearly, the colon of the older infected pigs was capable of effectively disposing of the unabsorbed carbohydrate, whereas in the younger infected pigs, nearly all of the dietary carbohydrate passed through the colon unchanged. It is now well established that SCF A are rapidly absorbed by colonic mucosa and utilized as a source of energy. Therefore, the microbial process converts unabsorbable and, therefore, osmotically active material to rapidly absorbed SCF A, thereby reducing the effective osmotic pressure of the colonic contents, and salvaging calories which would otherwise be unavailable. In addition, these SCF A, at concentrations observed in the 3-wkold pigs, have been shown to augment Na and water absorption from the colon of several animal species, including humans (21, 22) . The development of microbial digestion, therefore, appears to playa central role in the changes in colonic function observed. It is necessary to point out, however, that the artificial experimental conditions may have delayed the development of microbial digestion in the young pigs. The range of SCF A concentrations observed in the conventional pigs of this same age suggests a more rapid, but wide, variation in the rate of development of the process under those conditions. Thus\" the environment and diet of the animal may be equally or even more critical a factor than age in the inoculation of the bowel or the ability of the resident bacteria to ferment carbohydrate. Further study will be necessary to quantitatively assess the individual contribution of these factors to the development of colonic function.",
