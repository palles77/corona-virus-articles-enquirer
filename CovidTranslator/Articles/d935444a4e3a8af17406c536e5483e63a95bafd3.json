            "text": "This review summarizes the field's major findings related to the characterization of polyomavirus structures and to the characterization of virus receptors and mechanisms of host cell invasion. The four members of the family that have received the most attention in this regard are the mouse polyomavirus (mPyV), the monkey polyomavirus SV40, and the two human polyomaviruses, JCV and BKV. The structures of both the mPyV and SV40 alone and in complex with receptor fragments have been solved to high resolution. The majority of polyomaviruses recognize terminal sialic acid in either an \u03b12,3 linkage or an \u03b12,6 linkage to the underlying galactose. Studies on virus structure, receptor utilization and mechanisms of entry have led to new insights into how these viruses interact in an active way with cells to ensure the nuclear delivery and expression of their genomes. Critical work on virus entry has led to the discovery of a pH neutral endocytic compartment that accepts cargo from caveolae and to novel roles for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associated factors in virus uncoating and penetration of ER membranes. This review will summarize the major findings and compare and contrast the mechanisms used by these viruses to infect cells.",

            "text": "The family Polyomaviridae are classified as group 1 viruses in the Baltimore classification scheme as they contain double stranded DNA genomes. There is a single genus designation within the virus family (Polyomavirus) and this genus contains 14 different species that infect at least 8 different mammalian species. In addition to containing dsDNA genomes all members of this virus family are non-enveloped. The members of the family typically display restricted species and cell type specificity for lytic infection but many can induce the transformation of cells that do not support lytic infection. Host cell and species-specific transcription and replication factors contribute significantly to the restricted specificity displayed by these viruses (Feigenbaum et al., 1987; Lynch and Frisque, 1991; Tada et al., 1989) . Virus-receptor interactions are also known to contribute to cell type specificity and more importantly to pathogenesis in vivo (Caruso et al., 2007; Chen and Atwood, 2002; Dubensky et al., 1991; Freund et al., 1991a; Freund et al., 1991b; Fried et al., 1981) . Like many other virus families the polyomaviruses use multiple and often distinct receptors and entry mechanisms to infect cells. At high enough multiplicities many of these viruses can infect cells using alternative often poorly described mechanisms. The structures of two major members of the family have been solved in complex with receptor fragments and this has given insight into how these viruses recognize host cells (Liddington et al., 1991; Neu et al., 2008; Stehle and Harrison, 1997; Stehle et al., 1994) . A major area of current investigation by several labs is focused on understanding the intracellular trafficking of polyomaviruses in host cells and the mechanisms involved in virus uncoating and delivery of the dsDNA genomes to the nucleus. This paper will overview the field of virus structure and entry from its beginnings to the present. The focus will be on the mouse polyomavirus, on SV40, and on the two major human polyomaviruses, JCV and BKV.",

He noticed that mice inoculated with cell free extracts from leukemias were capable of not only transmitting leukemia to na\u00efve animals but that some of the animals also developed parotid tumors. In classic experiments he found that the \"parotid\" agent could be distinguished from the mouse leukemia virus by filtration. Filters with larger pore sizes allowed both viruses to pass but filters of smaller pore size selectively trapped the leukemia agent indicating Virology 384 (2009) [389] [390] [391] [392] [393] [394] [395] [396] [397] [398] [399] that the parotid agent was smaller than the leukemia virus. In the mid to late 1950s Stewart and Eddy followed up on these observations and found that the \"parotid\" agent was capable of inducing many different types of tumors when inoculated into mice and renamed the virus \"poly\"oma from the Greek for many tumors Stewart et al., 1958) .",

Shortly after virus cultivation a number of groups began examining the interaction of mPyV with host cells using both biochemical and electron microscopy (EM) techniques. Infection of cells by the mPyV was envisioned as a multi-step process that included virus adsorption, virus penetration, and virus uncoating. Morphological studies documented that whole virions were taken up into cells by phagocytosis as membrane bound single particles and membrane bound aggregates (Mattern et al., 1966; Mattern et al., 1967) . Virus particles then appeared between the nuclear membrane but viral particles were not seen within the nucleus at these early times. This led to the conclusion that viral particles uncoat between the nuclear membranes and before they reach the nucleus (as we will see later this interpretation is largely correct with some minor modifications).",

The ability to plaque purify virus preparations allowed for an enrichment of infectious virions and for their separation from empty capsids by density gradient centrifugation. Detailed analyses of these individual populations by EM indicated that empty capsids and light populations of virions (pseudovirions) were endocytosed by two different pathways (Bolen and Consigli, 1979; Mackay and Consigli, 1976) . Virions and pseudovirions were predominantly endocytosed as single membrane-bound particles that trafficked intact to the nucleus. Empty capsids were endocytosed as aggregates into large vesicles that later appeared to fuse with lysosomes, apparently destined for degradation. A model was developed showing these two opposing endocytic routes in the cell (Fig. 1) .",

Only virions and pseudovirions were found to contain species E leading the group to hypothesize that species E was critical for delivering virions and pseudovirions to the nucleus. Antibodies raised against virions that were found to be neutralizing specifically recognized species D, E, and F supporting this hypothesis (Bolen et al., 1981) . The group then went on to attempt isolation of cellular receptors for mPyV by preparing anti-idiotypic antibodies to VP1 (Marriott and Consigli, 1985; Marriott et al., 1987) .

SV40 was thought not to attach to sialic acid as it did not agglutinate red blood cells and neuraminidase treatment of host cells did not reduce infectivity (Clayson and Compans, 1989) . However, SV40 does attach to a sialic acid containing receptor, ganglioside GM1, with sialic acid being the major contact point, but the narrow specificity of SV40 for GM1 prevents it from binding to carbohydrates on red blood cells. In Fig. 1 . Early model of polyomavirus attachment, penetration, and nuclear entry. Open virions represent empty capsids that are found to be internalized in large endosomal vesicles that presumably lead to degradation. Closed virions represent infectious particles and unlike empty capsids these are internalized into monopinocytotic vesicles. Some virions were found in large tubular structures that likely represent the pinching off of these structures from caveosomes described years later by Helenius (see text for detailed descriptions). Modified from information in Mackay and Consigli, 1976 and Maul et al., 1978. addition, the neuraminidase used for treating cells before challenge with SV40 does not cleave the sialic acid off GM1 so that it leaves the receptor intact (Miller-Podraza et al., 1982) . It can even cleave sialic acid off higher order gangliosides to yield GM1. Therefore, neuraminidase treatment did not reduce SV40 receptors on cells and did not abolish infectivity. Early reports in the mPyV system suggested that the sialic acid interactions were largely due to non-specific electrostatic interactions between the virus and these negatively charged cell surface carbohydrates. Subsequent studies by the Paulson group proved this hypothesis to be incorrect (Cahan and Paulson, 1980; Fried et al., 1981) . They showed that mPyV recognized specific sialic acid structures on red blood cells and on mouse cells containing \u03b12,3linked sialic acid. Small and large plaque binding variants of mouse polyomavirus were subsequently shown to have different affinities for a branched compound that additionally contained a second, \u03b12,6linked sialic acid. Large plaque strains bound less well to the branched structure than did the small plaque strain (Cahan et al., 1983) . These data correlated well with an earlier study showing that small plaque viruses adsorb to cells much better than the large plaque strains (Diamond and Crawford, 1964) .",

More importantly these differences in plaque behavior directly translated to their behavior in mouse models of infection (Dubensky et al., 1991; Freund et al., 1991a) . The large plaque strain spread more efficiently in mice and induced a higher frequency of tumors and the tumors were more widespread than those caused by the small plaque strains.

This was found to be mediated by an LDV integrin binding motif present in mPyV VP1 as a specific mutation in this motif reduces JCV is unique in that it initially enters cells by clathrin dependent endocytosis. The virus then traffics to early endosomes and then to caveosomes. BKV, SV40, and mPyV are reported to use caveolae dependent mechanisms of entry that traffic these viruses to caveosomes. SV40 and mPyV can also use non-caveolar but cholesterol dependent mechanisms of entry to access the caveosome and the mechanism used depends on cell type. Once in the caveosome SV40 and mPyV traffic to the endoplasmic reticulum in tubular structures that bud off the ER membrane. It is presumed that JCV and BKV use the same pathway but data on this is lacking. Adapted from Marsh and Helenius, 1989. infectivity (Caruso et al., 2007) . Interestingly, when inoculated into newborn mice, the mPyV displays an altered pattern of infection when compared to wild type (Caruso et al., 2007) . Previous receptor hunting experiments described above would have missed this ligand as the virus apparently needs to undergo a conformational change after binding to sialic acid that then allows it to bind to the integrin receptors as a second step in the entry process. It is not certain whether infection of all cells requires this second step but it is clear that in some cases it is utilized. However, the LDV motif is buried under the receptor binding loops deep within VP1, and the mutation could have affected the structure of the binding site indirectly. Recent studies from both the Benjamin and Rapoport groups clearly delineated a role for the gangliosides GD1a and GT1b in mPyV infection and for the ganglioside GM1 in SV40 infection (Gilbert and Benjamin, 2004; Gilbert et al., 2005; Tsai et al., 2003) (Table 1 ). The Rapoport group used sucrose flotation assays to initially ask whether mPyV would float when mixed with plasma membrane preparations from human erythrocytes, from bacterial membranes or from yeast membranes. They found that when mPyV was incubated with buffer or with either bacterial or yeast membranes the virus fractionated in the bottom third of the gradient. When mPyV was incubated with plasma membrane from human erythrocytes the virus floated to the top of the gradient indicating an association with plasma membrane lipids. Upon treatment of the plasma membranes with neuraminidase the virus failed to float and fractionated at the bottom of the gradient.",

            "text": "This mode of internalization is strikingly similar to the one used by ER directed bacterial toxins of the AB 5 family, such as cholera toxin, whose known receptors are gangliosides. In the case of the toxins, however, trafficking proceeds through the Golgi. Thus far there is no evidence that mPyV or SV40 traffics through the Golgi and instead they appear to traffic through caveosomes to eventually reach the ER where partial uncoating of the viruses take place. Once the mPyV reaches the ER it takes advantage of an unusual member of the protein disulfide isomerase family, ERp29 (Magnuson et al., 2005) (Fig. 2) . PDI family members are oxidoreductases that contain one to several CXXC motifs in their thioredoxin domains (Hebert and Molinari, 2007) . They function to both reduce and oxidize disulphide bonds in newly synthesized proteins. They also isomerize disulphide bonds assisting in the formation of native protein structures. ERp29 is structurally related to PDI proteins but it contains only a single cysteine in its Fig. 3 . Mechanisms used by polyomaviruses to exit the ER and target their genomes to the nucleus. The mouse polyomavirus and SV40 both traffic to the ER and it is presumed but not formally proven that JCV and BKV do the same. Once in the ER mPyV utilizes the unusual PDI family member, ERp29 to induce a conformational change in its coat protein. This may lead to cleavage of the C-terminal arm of VP1 allowing the particle to bind to lipid membranes. The ER retrotranslocation protein Derlin 2 is involved in ER exit. SV40 utilizes the canonical ER oxidoreductases, PDI, and ERp57, to unravel 12 of the vertex pentamers in the virus shell. This unfolded protein is then recognized by components of the ER associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (Derlin 1 and SelL1) to exit the ER. The viruses encounter a low calcium environment in the cytosol that may allow for their further disassembly. Once disassembled the viral protein-mini-chromosome complex is transported across an intact nuclear pore for genome delivery to the nucleus. entire sequence and hence can only function in the isomerization reaction. A role for ERp29 in normal cellular functions has not been established. The Tsai group identified ERp29 as the PDI family member responsible for inducing a conformational change in mPyV VP1 that exposes a trypsin sensitive site in VP1 (Tsai et al., 2003) (Fig. 3) . This conformational change is thought to result in the proteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal arm of VP1. As the C-terminal arm is involved in linking and stabilizing pentamer-pentamer interactions its cleavage would be predicted to destabilize the particle. The cleavage also led to the formation of a virion particle capable of binding and penetrating a lipid bilayer. This is predicted to facilitate the release of a partially disassembled and de-stabilized virion into the cytosol where nuclear localization signals in the VP1 protein could direct it across the nuclear pore (Fig. 3) . Work from the Benjamin lab identified another ER protein as being critical for mPyV infection. In this study shRNAs directed at a protein involved in retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins out of the ER, Derlin 2, was found to significantly impair mPyV infection (Lilley et al., 2006) (Fig. 3) . In related work Helenius and colleagues found that several ER associated factors played critical roles in SV40 disassembly and release from the ER (Schelhaas et al., 2007) (Fig. 3) . Inhibition of PDI, ERp57, and Derlin 1 by siRNA knockdown all inhibited SV40 infection of cells. Knockdown of ERp29, calnexin or calreticulin had no effect on SV40 infection. They found that ERp57 uncoupled the 12 five-coordinated VP1 pentamers of SV40. This led to complete uncoating in the presence of EGTA, which removes the calcium ions that help to anchor the incoming C-terminal arms. The group also demonstrated a role for Derlin 1 and SelL1, two proteins involved in the ERAD retrotranslocation pathway in SV40 infection (Fig. 3) . The model that emerges is one where the virion is delivered to the ER where it is recognized by components of the ER quality control machinery and is subjected to PDI related proteins that isomerize specific disulfide bonds involved in linking pentamers together within the capsid. The destabilized virion is then recognized essentially as a misfolded protein and is retrotranslocated out of the ER where it encounters a low calcium environment in the cytosol. Calcium is critical for viral particle stability and low levels of calcium in the cytosol likely contribute to further destabilization of the virion. Exposure of nuclearlocalization signals in viral capsid proteins that likely remain bound to the mini-chromosome then transport the mini-chromosome across the nuclear pore (Ishii et al., 1996; Kasamatsu and Nakanishi, 1998; Nakanishi et al., 1996; Yamada and Kasamatsu, 1993) (Fig. 3) . It thus appears that at least two polyomaviruses, mPyV and SV40, utilize ER associated degradative pathways for uncoating.",

Hummeler and colleagues followed the fate of SV40 particles in cells by electron microscopy (Hummeler et al., 1970) . They describe the majority of particles becoming rapidly enveloped at the plasma membrane into monopinocytotic vesicles. SV40 particles could be seen as early as 1 h post-infection in the nucleus. Maul and colleagues subsequently investigated the uptake and trafficking of SV40 in permissive and nonpermissive cells (Maul et al., 1978) . No qualitative differences were seen between the two cell types indicating that these steps did not restrict virus infection of cells. Their findings were very similar to those of Hummeler but they described several intervening steps in the entry process including a prominent association of viral particles in tubular membrane structures and of particles associated with rough ER. They did observe particles in the nucleus but these particles were not surrounded by membrane. They proposed a model where the entry of SV40 followed a series of membrane fusion and fission steps eventually liberating virions in the nucleus for uncoating. As they observed some free virions in the cytoplasm and some in the nucleus they proposed that the nucleus must contain an uncoating enzyme not present in the cytosol. As it turns out it appears that the ER contains the necessary factors for uncoating. The tubular structures they observed were likely virions pinching off in large tubular structures from caveosomes as described by Helenius many years later (Pelkmans et al., 2001) . These tubular vesicles are transported to the ER in a microtubual dependent manner (Pelkmans et al., 2001) (Fig. 2) . We now appreciate that most if not all polyomaviruses are trafficked to the ER where uncoating occurs or at least begins.",

Entry is relatively slow and proceeds in a pH neutral manner from caveolae to caveosomes to the ER (Pelkmans et al., 2001) . In addition to the ganglioside GM1, SV40 was also reported to use MHC class I molecules to infect permissive cells (Atwood and Norkin, 1989) (Table  1) .

The 5HT2a receptor is sufficient to confer susceptibility to cells lacking this receptor (HeLa and HEK293A). Infection of 5HT2aR expressing cells is still neuraminidase sensitive indicating a prominent role for cellular carbohydrates in infection. The 5HT2aR protein contains several potential glycosylation sites but it is unclear whether the sialic acid moieties responsible for infection reside on this protein or on other sialic acid containing molecules such as gangliosides. One group has found that JCV can infect human brain microvascular endothelial cells that lack the 5HT2a receptor (Chapagain et al., 2007) . Infection is very inefficient but the results indicate that virus infection can proceed by alternative mechanisms on some cell types.",

            "text": "The polyomavirus capsid consists of 12 five-coordinated and 60 sixcoordinated morphological units that assemble into a T = 7d icosahedral capsid (Klug, 1965) . Icosahedral capsid symmetry allows the virus to construct a container for its DNA from a large number of identical subunits, eliminating the need to encode many different components (Crick and Watson, 1956) . Strict icosahedral symmetry, in which all subunits as well as their interactions with each other are identical, can only apply to capsids consisting of no more than 60 identical subunits. Some exceptionally simple isocahedral virus capsids are indeed constructed from 60 identical subunits and therefore possess strict icosahedral symmetry (Tsao et al., 1991) . However, the need for more complex structures that can package larger genes as well as internal proteins requires for many viruses a capsid that cannot be formed with such a small number of subunits. Therefore, most viruses, including polyomaviruses, build larger capsids constructed from multiples of 60 subunits. In these capsids, subunits must be joined in a quasiequivalent manner, meaning that they do not form the same contacts with their neighbors throughout the capsid, but exhibit flexibility or alternative binding modes to accommodate local symmetry mismatches (Caspar and Klug, 1962) . The quasiequivalence principle postulated that the pentavalent and hexavalent morphological units of such larger icosahedral capsids were pentamers and hexamers of the same subunit. In some cases, this has been proven correct, e.g. for herpesvirus capsids (Zhou et al., 2000) . The T = 7d icosahedral capsids of polyomaviruses were therefore also thought to consist of 420 subunits, grouped into 12 pentamers and 60 hexamers of the major capsid protein VP1 (Finch, 1974) . However, the crystal structure of the mPyV capsid at 22.5 \u00c5 resolution revealed that both the fiveand sixcoordinated morphological units of the capsid were in fact pentamers, a surprising result that appeared to challenge the concept of quasiequivalence as the same pentameric module is able to form both pentavalent and hexavalent contacts (Rayment et al., 1982) . The crystal structure of SV40 at 3.8 \u00c5 resolution, which was determined almost 10 years later finally provided the molecular basis for the unexpected capsid construction of polyomaviruses (Liddington et al., 1991) . It revealed that the interpentamer contacts are primarily mediated by C-terminal extensions of VP1, termed arms, that protrude in different directions from each VP1 monomer and contact neighboring pentamers. Both pentavalent and hexavalent pentamers donate and accept five C-terminal arms to tie the capsid together. The VP1 pentamer cores and the contacts between incoming arm and acceptor monomer are identical throughout the capsid, demonstrating that the polyomavirus capsid also uses a form of quasiequivalence as the basis for its construction. Monomeric VP1 is formed by two antiparallel \u03b2-sheets: a sheet formed by strands B, I, D and G (the BIDG sheet) and a sheet formed by strands C, H, E and F (the CHEF sheet). The two \u03b2-sheets are organized into a jelly-roll fold, a structural motif that is quite often observed in virus capsid proteins but rare in non-viral proteins. Each incoming arm adds one strand (J\u2032) to the edge of the BIDG sheet of a monomer. The J\u2032 strand is then fixed by the N-terminus of the accepting monomer, which acts as a clamp by adding a short helix and a final \u03b2-strand (A) to the sheet next to the J\u2032 strand. The assembled structure is further stabilized by two calcium ions. These findings were confirmed for mPyV and are thought to hold true for the other members of the polyomavirus family as well because of conservation of the key contact residues (Stehle et al., 1996; Stehle et al., 1994) .",

In free pentamers, this part of VP1 forms a \u03b2-strand that aligns with the G strand and contacts residues at the beginning of the C-terminal arm.

The sialylated oligosaccharides used as receptor mimics bound to VP1 in shallow pockets on the outer surface of the pentamers. These sialylated oligosaccharides were later found to be portions of the GD1a and GT1b gangliosides, which are the physiologic receptors for mPyV (Tsai et al., 2003) . The same group also identified the ganglioside GM1 as a receptor for SV40 (Tsai et al., 2003) . The structural and functional characterization of the interaction between SV40 and GM1 was made possible because a wide variety of glycans were available for defining receptor specificity and as the oligosaccharide portion of GM1 was available in amounts sufficient for structural analysis (Campanero-Rhodes et al., 2007; Neu et al., 2008) . As an increasing amount of structural information on viral attachment proteins in complex with sialylated carbohydrate receptors has become available in recent years, we will focus the remainder of this chapter on those findings and their general implications.",

Paramyxoviruses bind to their host cells with their haemagglutininneuraminidase protein that uses the same binding site for attachment to NeuNAc and cleavage of its glycosidic bond (Crennell et al., 2000) . We will, however, focus here on viral proteins that solely NeuNAc is depicted in orange, the protein residues forming hydrogen bonds to NeuNAc are colored green and the residues making van der Waals contacts are colored grey. The viral surface is shown in grey. This figure was prepared with PyMol (DeLano Scientific, Inc.). mediate attachment and do not possess enzymatic activity. Sialic acid binding by catalytically active viral neuraminidases is probably not directly comparable to binding by attachment proteins, as neuraminidase function requires high affinity as well as additional binding energy to distort the sialic acid for catalysis. Neuraminidases thus feature deeply buried binding sites with a higher number of specific contacts than are found in attachment proteins.",

First, in all viral complexes, NeuNAc is the major, and in the case of Ad37 and VP8\u204e the only, point of contact. This distinguishes these complexes from, for example, bacterial toxins, which can also recognize sialylated receptors but form more contacts with carbohydrates attached to sialic acid than with the sialic acid itself (Fotinou et al., 2001; Merritt et al., 1994; Stenmark et al., 2008) . Second, all viral attachment complexes bind NeuNAc in shallow depressions rather than deep grooves on the protein surface. The affinities for these interactions are only in the millimolar range, which is consistent with the exposed binding surfaces (Burmeister et al., 2004; Dormitzer et al., 2002b; Eisen et al., 1997; Neu et al., 2008; Stehle et al., 1996) . A relatively low affinity may in fact be crucial for a productive viral infection as a very tight attachment to the host cell will prevent progeny virus from spreading. Third, the attachment protein complexes all feature NeuNAc in its chair conformation, which is the preferred conformation in solution. Fourth, as detailed in the next section, there are several parallels in the strategies used by attachment proteins to bind sialic acid.",

The mPyV and Ad37 form salt bridges from the positively charged side chains of Arg and Lys residues to the negatively charged carboxylate group (Figs. 4E and C, respectively). By contrast, the other three viruses engage the carboxylate group with two parallel hydrogen bonds. In each case, the carboxylate group accepts two hydrogen bonds from two specifically spaced hydrogen bond donors in the proteins. In the Influenza HA, SV40 VP1 and Rotavirus VP8\u204e complexes, these are either the hydroxyl groups of Ser and Thr side chains or backbone amido groups (Figs. 4B, D, E) . These parallel hydrogen bonds also have similar geometry. For each of them, the angle between the carboxylate C1, the carboxylate O that is engaged and the hydrogen bond donor approaches 120\u00b0.",

The N-acetyl group, situated on the opposite side of the sugar ring as the carboxylate group, can serve as additional \"handle\" on NeuNAc and it provides specificity by additional favourable contacts with the correct ligand. The N5 atom of the N-acetyl group is contacted by a hydrogen bond in each of the complexes. The binding partners are hydrogen bond acceptors in the protein, such as backbone carbonyl groups (Figs. 4B-D) , the side chain carbonyl group of an Asn residue (Fig. 4F ) or the hydroxyl group of a Tyr side chain (Fig. 4E) . The mPyV VP1 also forms an additional hydrogen bond by an Asn side chain, which contacts the carbonyl group of the acetyl function. With the sole exception of mPyV VP1, the binding sites of all proteins also feature a depression into which the methyl group of the N-acetyl moiety inserts. This depression is shallow and rather hydrophobic in the case of Ad37, Influenza HA and Rotavirus VP8\u204e, as it is lined with hydrophobic side chains (Figs. 4B-D) . Interestingly, SV40 VP1 does not feature such a shallow depression to accommodate the methyl group. Rather, it has a substantially deeper pocket that is formed by hydrophobic residues such as Leu65 and Phe75 and lined with hydrophilic side chains of residues Gln62 and Gln278 at its rim (Fig. 4F) . The natural hosts of SV40 are monkeys, in which N-glycolyl neuraminic acid (NeuNGc) is the predominant sialic acid. In contrast to the human NeuNAc, NeuNGc has an additional hydroxyl group attached to the methyl group. The big, partly hydrophilic and likely water-filled cavity in SV40 could likely accommodate the more polar NeuNGc better than NeuNAc (Campanero-Rhodes et al., 2007) , which might account for its shape.",

In addition, most also feature a depression that accommodates the methyl group of the N-acetyl moiety. Since all binding surfaces are exposed, the interactions determining NeuNAc binding lie in the rather polar environment of the protein surface. The polar interactions are therefore probably quite weak. Hydrogen bonds between sialic acid and protein atoms can be replaced by contacts between water molecules and protein atoms without much difference in energy. Salt bridges in aqueous solution also possess less energy than salt bridges that are located in a partially hydrophobic, solvent-inaccessible environment. Likewise, the non-polar van der Waals interactions between carbohydrate and protein are also not very strong as such interactions increase in strength with the area of surface buried in the contact. Most of the contacts described above exclude rather small areas from solvent compared to the extensive interfaces found in protein-protein complexes.",

            "text": "Two of the viruses mentioned before, Rhesus Rotavirus and Ad37, appear to bind NeuNAc relatively indiscriminately, although it is possible that additional carbohydrates may contribute to binding. mPyV, SV40 and different strains of influenzaviruses, however, have distinct specificities for the structural contexts of the sialic acid. mPyV VP1 binds carbohydrates containing a NeuNAc-\u03b12,3-Gal motif that is unbranched at the Gal position (Cahan et al., 1983) . The Gal moiety is recognized by a hydrogen bond between the backbone carbonyl group of Gly78 and the distinctive axial O4 hydroxyl group of Gal (Stehle and Harrison, 1997) . The lack of a side chain in Gly78 also confers binding specificity since the presence of even a small side chain in this position would cause sterical clashes with the Gal and abolish binding. The architecture of the binding site accepts only one conformation of the NeuNAc-\u03b12,3-Gal glycosidic linkage. This conformation is stabilized by an internal hydrogen bond and also occurs in solution, but it could not be adopted by compounds that are branched at the Gal residue due to steric clashes. SV40 VP1 possesses quite narrow specificity for the oligosaccharide part of the ganglioside GM1, which is a branched compound of the following structure: Gal-\u03b21,3-GalNAc-\u03b21,4-[NeuNAc-\u03b12,3-]-Gal-\u03b21,4-Glc. While SV40 still binds the same compound with NeuNGc substituted for NeuNAc, binding is abolished if one of the terminal sugars, i.e. Gal or NeuNAc, are removed or if one of them bears an additional sugar moiety (Campanero-Rhodes et al., 2007; Neu et al., 2008) . Both the Gal-\u03b21,3-GalNAc and NeuNAc branches directly contact the protein, providing binding affinity. The core structure of GM1, i.e. the branching Gal with GalNAc and NeuNAc attached to neighboring atoms is sterically constrained as clashes between GalNAc and NeuNAc could occur in many conformations of the glycosidic linkages. The moiety adopts one dominant conformation in solution (Poppe et al., 1994) , which is bound by SV40 VP1. Specificity therefore arises from SV40 recognizing the correct placement of the two binding arms by a rigid spacer.",

            "text": "Different strains of Influenza A virus infect different species because their HA molecules bind sialic acid in different contexts. The adaptation of avian HAs to human hosts occurs by a switch in binding specificity from avian-like \u03b12,3-sialylated glycans to the longer \u03b12,6-sialylated glycans that are present in the upper respiratory tract epithelia of humans (Russell et al., 2006; Skehel and Wiley, 2000; Stevens et al., 2006; van Riel et al., 2007) . NeuNAc is bound in the same orientation and by the same residues of both avian and human HAs so that specificity is conferred by the residues in contact with additional monosaccharides. Recent data indicate that the different glycan types are not discriminated by contacts with the sugar residue to which the NeuNAc is linked, but that the different overall topology of the glycans is recognized (Chandrasekaran et al., 2008) . Given the preferred torsion angles of the NeuNAc-\u03b12,3-Gal-\u03b21,3/4-GlcNAc motif typical of the recognized \u03b12,3-linked glycans, the Gal-\u03b21,3/4-GalNAc part is fairly linear and can occupy the space delineated by a cone with NeuNAc at its tip. Sugar moieties farther away from the NeuNAc mostly do not interact with the protein in this conformation. The glycans containing \u03b12,6-linked NeuNAc, for which NeuNAc-\u03b12,6-Gal-\u03b21,4-GlcNAc is typical, can also adopt this coneshaped topology. However, these also sample a topology, in which the Gal is relatively fixed with respect to NeuNAc and there is a kink at the Gal position, forcing the GlcNAc and subsequent sugars to point back towards the protein. The space that can be sampled by the glycan therefore resembles an umbrella, with NeuNAc-\u03b12,6-Gal as the stick and the rest of the glycan as the umbrella. For \u03b12,6-linked trisaccharides that can sample both cone-and umbrella-shaped topologies, the cone-shaped one is preferred. However, the longer \u03b12,6-linked glycans that confer infectivity in humans prefer the umbrella-shaped topologies, leading to additional contacts with the protein. If the HA of an influenza strain cannot accommodate these long, umbrella-shaped \u03b12,6-linked glycans, it cannot spread in humans (Chandrasekaran et al., 2008) .",

In the case of SV40, only the correct GM1 receptor bound to the protein. Smaller, unbranched components of the GM1 structure would not have given insight into SV40 receptor binding as they do not bind with detectable affinity (Neu et al., 2008) . Several other viruses, e.g. strains of coronavirus and reovirus, bind sialylated glycans, but structural information about these interactions is currently lacking. The availability of complex glycans and the use of glycan screens to define binding specificity have proven of great importance and will undoubtedly advance the understanding of glycan binding by these other viruses.",

            "text": "The original studies describing polyomavirus host cell interactions depicted infection as involving a series of discrete steps that included virus adsorption, virus entry into membrane bound organelles, and virus trafficking by sequential membrane fusion and fission events. Although there was controversy regarding whether these viruses could penetrate the nuclear envelope intact an early pivotal study demonstrated that the virus capsid only penetrates the outer nuclear envelope. Recent studies on these viruses describe largely the same series of steps but in significantly more detail. We now know and appreciate that the majority of these viruses recognize specific linkages of sialic acid on gangliosides and glycoproteins. These viruses also recognize other cellular components such as the 5HT2a receptor for JCV, \u03b14\u03b21 integrin for mPyV, and the MHC class I protein for SV40, likely as part of a receptor complex with gangliosides or other sialic acid containing structures. There are clear cell type specific and viral strain differences that determine what components of the receptor complex are required to initiate infection. Once bound to cells all of these viruses induce molecular signals that initiate infectious entry. The mPyV, SV40, and BKV all infect cells by caveolae dependent endocytosis. Non-caveolar cholesterol dependent mechanisms can also be exploited by some of these viruses depending on cell type. Downstream of both caveolae and raft dependent mechanisms the viruses traffic to a pH neutral caveosome that lacks markers of other cellular organelles. High resolution video microscopy of virus entry has found that these viruses are trafficked out of the caveosomes in elongated tubular structures that fuse with the ER membrane. This trafficking step is dependent on microtubules. The human polyomavirus, JCV, appears to be an exception and rather than utilizing caveloae to enter cells this virus exploits clathrin dependent mechanisms to initially traffic to early endosomes. In the early endosomes JCV is found to be tightly opposed to the inner leaflet of the endosome and in a pH and Rab5 dependent step traffics from the early endosome to caveosomes. At this point the virus likely follows the fate of other polyomaviruses and travels to the ER. Once in the ER the viruses take advantage of protein disulfide isomerases to rearrange their capsid structure. In the case of SV40, PDI and ERp57 rearrange the 12 five-coordinated VP1 pentamers. The now misfolded structure is recognized by components of the ERAD pathway (Derlin 1, SelL1) and exported to the cytosol. Calcium levels in the cytosol of resting cells are significantly lower (0.1 \u03bcM) than levels in the ER (100-400 \u03bcM). As calcium is required to stabilize polyomavirus virions the low levels of calcium encountered as the destabilized virus exits the ERAD pathway are likely sufficient to further distort and disassemble the virion and prepare it for transport through the nuclear pore. In the case of mPyV a novel PDI like protein, ERp29 acts to unfold VP1 exposing a protease sensitive site in the Cterminal arm of the protein. Once cleaved the destabilized particle can insert into a lipid membrane. The virus may directly escape the ER via this mechanism or it might utilize the retrotranslocator Derlin 2 as inhibition of this protein reduces mPyV infection. It is likely that the two human polyomaviruses use similar mechanisms to escape the ER but this has not been formally demonstrated.",

Subsequent high resolution structural studies provided the molecular basis for this unexpected capsid construction. It revealed that the interpentamer contacts are primarily mediated by C-terminal extensions of VP1, termed arms, that protrude in different directions from each VP1 monomer and contact neighboring pentamers. Both pentavalent and hexavalent pentamers donate and accept five C-terminal arms to tie the capsid together. The VP1 pentamer cores and the contacts between incoming arm and acceptor monomer are identical throughout the capsid, demonstrating that the polyomavirus capsid also uses a form of quasiequivalence as the basis for its construction. Recent high resolution structural studies on viral capsid proteins in complex with receptor fragments has provided a detailed picture of how these viruses engage this component of the receptor complex. This level of detail may provide the basis for the design of small molecular weight compounds capable of antagonizing polyomavirus host cells receptor interactions and may in time lead to novel therapeutic approaches to treat patients with polyomavirus induced disease.",
