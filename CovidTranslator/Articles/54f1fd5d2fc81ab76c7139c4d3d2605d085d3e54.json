Inhibition of coiled coil-mediated interactions using bioactive peptides that replicate an \u03b1-helical chain from the viral fusion machinery has significant antiviral potential. Here, we present the construction of a series of lipopeptides composed of a de novo heptad repeat sequence-based \u03b1-helical peptide plus a hydrocarbon tail. Promisingly, the constructs adopted stable \u03b1-helical conformations and exhibited relatively broad-spectrum antiviral activities against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and influenza A viruses (IAVs). Together, these findings reveal a new strategy for relatively broad-spectrum antiviral drug discovery by relying on the tunability of the \u03b1-helical coiled-coil domains present in all class I fusion proteins and the amphiphilic nature of the individual helices from this multihelix motif.",

            "text": "During the coiled-coil six-helix bundle (6HB) assembly, three N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) regions of viral fusion proteins initially form a central trimeric helix scaffold that becomes temporarily exposed, creating a metastable prehairpin conformation; three C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) regions then pack onto the periphery of the trimeric NHR inner core in an antiparallel orientation. 15 Bioactive peptides derived from the CHR motif of class I viral fusion proteins, designated as Cpeptides, act as decoy \u03b1-helices and are able to bind to their corresponding NHR helical trimers to form a heterologous nonfunctional 6HB structure in a virus-specific manner, thereby antagonizing the refolding of the endogenous CHR region and competitively inhibiting virus\u2212host cell membrane fusion. 16 In 1993, Jiang and colleagues discovered a highly potent HIV-1 fusion inhibitory peptides derived from the CHR region of HIV-1 gp41, designated SJ-2176; in 1994, Wild et al. reported another CHR-peptide, DP-178 (also named T20 later). 17 ,18 T20 (brand name, Fuzeon; generic name, enfuvirtide) was finally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2003 for clinical use as the first fusion inhibitor-based anti-HIV drug. The discovery of these anti-HIV peptides spurred the identification of antiviral peptides against other viruses that utilize class I fusion proteins, including the recently identified MERS-CoV. After the emergence of MERS-CoV infection, Gao's group and Jiang's group independently solved the crystal structure of MERS-CoV's 6HB fusion core. 13, 19 On the basis of the 6HB structure, Jiang's group reported the highly effective anti-MERS-CoV peptide HR2PM2. Most recently, we identified a hydrocarbonstapled short \u03b1-helical peptide that could inhibit MERS-CoV infection at the low micromolar level. 20 Considering the universal 6HB fusion mechanism employed by class I enveloped viruses, inhibition of NHR/CHR coiled coilmediated interactions has significant potential for the development of broad-spectrum therapeutic interventions.",

Structural analysis has demonstrated that a high variability in the primary sequence of CHR motifs within the HIV-1 6HB is allowed as long as the driving force for coiled-coil assembly, i.e., amphiphilic characteristics of the individual helices, is maintained. 26, 27 Accordingly, \u03b1helix-constrained HIV-neutralizing C-peptides, engineered by strategies such as salt bridges, 28, 29 helix-favoring amino acids, 30 and hydrophobic mutations in buried residues, 31 can significantly enhance the bundle stability compared with their corresponding wild-type ligands despite the substitution of approximately half of the parent residues.",

            "text": "Initially, we aimed to establish combinations of foreground a-d residues in the heptad repeat moiety. As previous experiments have indicated that alanine residues are strongly biased toward helix formation in peptides, 38 the design of the novel lipopeptide began with the peptide named AAS (Table 1 ), in which hydrophobic alanine residues were placed at the a and d positions of the heptad, and a small helix-favoring polar residue, i.e., serine, which has been widely utilized in protein functional scanning strategies, 39 was populated at the e positions. To explore the influence of hydrophobic residue contact at \u03b1-helix-mediated coiled-coil interaction sites on antiviral activity, substitutions at the a-d positions of the peptide AAS were made with different hydrophobic residues, including Val, Phe, Tyr, Leu, and Ile. We used our previously developed MERS-CoV S protein-mediated cell\u2212cell fusion assay to test the biological activity of these peptides. 40 As shown in Table 1 , all of the lipopeptides potently inhibited cell\u2212cell fusion mediated by MERS-CoV S protein, with 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) values ranging from 0.1 to >10.0 \u03bcM. Of the six lipopeptides we designed, both LLS and IIS were found to be potent MERS-CoV fusion inhibitors, with EC 50 values of 0.24 and 0.10 \u03bcM, respectively. The possible reasons for this activity include the evolutionary preference for Leu and Ile in the heptad positions a-d for viral fusion glycoprotein sequences and the significance of creating enough hydrophobicity/amphiphilicity to yield a stable coiled-coil structure. 41 Compared to LLS, IIS possessed obviously lower cytotoxicity in Huh-7 cells, which were used as target cells in the cell\u2212cell fusion assay. Therefore, in the next round of analogues, we further mutated residues at the e position of the heptad of IIS with different types of polar residues, including cationic Lys, anionic Glu, and uncharged Gln, as well as aromatic/heterocyclic amino acids such as Tyr, Trp, and His, expecting that these optimizations would provide further improvement in potency and cytotoxicity. Strikingly, Glncontaining IIQ and Tyr-containing IIY had EC 50 values of 0.11 and 0.52 \u03bcM, respectively, even reaching the potencies of the MERS-CoV-specific fusion inhibitor HR2PM2 peptide. 42 In addition, both IIQ and IIY possessed lower cytotoxicity values than the selected lead IIS, with a 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC 50 ) value of >100 \u03bcM. Subsequently, we tested the inhibitory activity of the peptide IIQ on the entry of pseudovirus carrying the wild-type MERS-CoV S protein. As shown in Supporting Information, Figure S1 , IIQ was effective against MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection, with an EC 50 value of 0.13 \u03bcM; this finding was in close agreement with the cell\u2212 cell fusion assay results. These data imply that the de novo designed peptides that are nonhomologous with the naturally occurring MERS-CoV S protein sequence could effectively inhibit MERS-CoV infection by targeting virus\u2212host cell membrane fusion. Moreover, we explored the structural properties of these lipopeptides by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to determine if their propensities to adopt \u03b1helical structure were correlated with anti-MERS-CoV activity. The relationships between the EC 50 s of lipopeptides and their \u03b1-helical content are shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. We found that the potency was not strictly dependent on their \u03b1-helicity (r 2 = 0.2439), suggesting that other factors, such as solubility and target binding affinity and kinetics, may be involved in their biological activity. This phenomena has also been observed in the studies on HIV-1 fusion inhibitors, where several C-peptides exhibited no anti-HIV-1 potency despite they have fully \u03b1-helical structure in solution. 29, 43 The number of 293T/MERS/EGFP cells fused or unfused with Huh-7 cells were countered, and the percentage of inhibition was calculated as described in the experimental section. Data were derived from the results of three independent experiments and are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. b These peptides have an acetyl group at the N-terminus and carboxyamide at the C-terminus.

Surprisingly, one of the lipopeptides, IIQ, displayed potent inhibitory activity toward both strains A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/8/68 (H3N2), with EC 50 values of 1.73 and 0.70 \u03bcM, respectively (Table 2) . Furthermore, none of these peptides displayed a cytotoxic effect against Madin\u2212Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM. The selective index of IIQ was larger than 143, indicating a safe profile for further exploration. The data presented in Table S1 in the Supporting Information show that IIQ was also potent against oseltamivir-resistant strains, including LN/1109 (H1N1) and TJ/15 (H1N1), with EC 50 values of 4.36 and 3.03 \u03bcM, respectively, whereas oseltamivir was much less effective (EC 50 = 21.7 \u03bcM) against LN/1109 (H1N1) and inactive against TJ/15 (H1N1) at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM. In addition, IIQ also exerted remarkable inhibitory activity against B/Lee/40 strain infection with an EC 50 value of 1.87 \u00b1 0.95 \u03bcM. As expected, MERS-CoV HR2PM2 displayed no inhibition effect against A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) and A/ Hong Kong/68 (H3N2) infection at the concentration up to 20 \u03bcM. The life cycle of influenza virus is divided into three steps, i.e., virus entry, viral genome replication, and progeny virion release. 45 Currently, several anti-influenza drugs have been developed for interruption of specific processes in influenza infection. Among them, oseltamivir (Tamiflu) targets neuraminidase (NA) protein, thus preventing release of tethered progeny virus from its host cells. 46 Favipiravir that selectively inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase has been approved in Japan as an inhibitor of influenza virus replication for the treatment of influenza virus infection in 2014. 47 We then asked if the IIQ peptide acts by inhibiting the entry step of IAV into host cells.

In the mini-replicon system, viral RNA polymerase protein expression plasmids mediate the expression of a reporter genome encoding firefly luciferase. Through determination of the normalized firefly luminescence/Renilla luminescence ratio, we found that favipiravir could inhibit influenza replicon activity in a dose-dependent manner, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value of 26.2 \u00b1 3.7 \u03bcM, whereas IIQ and the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir exhibited no significant inhibition at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM ( Figure 2A ). As shown in Figure 2B ,C, neither IIQ nor favipiravir was able to disturb cleavage of the substrate by neuraminidase from the two IAV strains A/Puerto Rico/8/ 34 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/8/68 (H3N2) in the test range. In contrast, oseltamivir could inhibit neuraminidase of these two viruses, with IC 50 values of 1.71 \u00b1 0.2 and 0.51 \u00b1 0.01 nM, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest IIQ may affect the entry stage of viral life cycle to block virus infection. Moreover, using a time-of-addition assay, we found that the viral load at intervals of 0\u221210 h (covering the whole life cycle) and 0\u22122 h (covering the entry step) was reduced by approximately 60%, with the addition of 10 \u03bcM IIQ, as compared with the PBS control, and no antiviral activity was observed for the remaining three time intervals (2\u22125, 5\u22128, and 8\u221210 h). However, favipiravir continued to exert its full effect, even at the interval of 5\u22128 h. These results further confirmed that IIQ targets the entry step in the IAV life cycle ( Figure  2D \u2212F). Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay is wellestablished to determine whether the sialic acid-binding site on HA1 subunit acts as potential drug target; meanwhile, hemolysis inhibition assay is commonly used to determine whether the HA2 subunit can be a possible target. 48 Thus, an HI assay was first performed to determine the potential effect of IIQ peptide on the HA1 subunit sialic acid-binding site. The result showed that no apparent inhibition of influenza virusinduced aggregation of chicken erythrocytes was observed in the test range, indicating IIQ has no effect on the interaction of HA1 subunit with its sialic acid receptor (Supporting Information, Figure S3A ). Moreover, the hemolysis inhibition assay showed that the lysis of erythrocytes caused by the conformational rearrangements of HA2 subunit under acidic condition was decreased compared with the hemolytic effect of virus only (Supporting Information, Figure S3B ). The combined results indicate that IIQ may bind to the HA2 subunit to interrupt the conformational changes in HA2 rather ",

After identifying that the entry/fusion process phase of the life cycle of MERS-CoV and IAV was the point of interference, we explored whether the IIQ peptide would interact with the corresponding NHR region of viral fusion proteins with a mechanism of action similar to virus-specific C-peptides. The first piece of evidence came from native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (N-PAGE) of equimolar mixtures of IIQ plus synthetic peptides containing the NHR segments of the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein S2 subunit, designated as HR1P, 13 and the postfusion structure of the H3N2 hemagglutinin (HA) HA2 subunit, namely N66, 49 respectively. The mixtures of IIQ/HR1P and IIQ/N66 showed new bands at the upper positions in the gel, demonstrating that tightly associated complexes were formed ( Figure 3A ). These findings are consistent with the results obtained from circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, in which the signal of these mixtures was dramatically greater than that of the mathematical sum of the corresponding isolated peptides, suggesting induction of a large \u03b1-helical structure resulting from their interaction ( Figure  3B ,C). 50 Moreover, data from CD analysis indicated that the IIQ/HR1P and IIQ/N66 helical bundles showed strong thermal stability, with melting temperature values of >90 and 83.1\u00b0C, respectively ( Figure 3D and Supporting Information, Table S2 ). In CD analysis, N36/C34 6HB, 31 which has an available crystal structure and is widely used to represent the HIV-1 fusion core, was used as a positive control (Supporting Information, Figure S4 ). Finally, sedimentation velocity analysis demonstrated the heterogeneous 6HB states of the IIQ/HR1P complex and the IIQ/N66 complex (Supporting Information, Table S3 and Figure S5 ). Together, these data suggest that the active IIQ peptide does indeed associate with a site in the NHR region and forms heterogeneous 6HB structures that interfere with the fusion between virus and target cell membrane.",

In comparison, the unconjugated peptide IIQ\u0394, which exhibited no significant inhibitory activity at the concentration up to 40 \u03bcM on both MERS-CoV pseudovirus and A/Puerto Rico/8/ 34 (H1N1) infection, did not show lipid vesicle binding. These observations indicate that IIQ can bind to a lipid bilayer. Although HIV-1-neutralizing CHR peptides provide a classic paradigm for the rational design of fusion inhibitors that interfere with the interaction between the heptad-repeat regions of class I viral fusion proteins, the development of such drugs with novel modes of action against IAV remains a challenge, mainly by the inaccessibility of exogenously added C-peptides to the endocytic compartment, where fusogenic 6HB formation takes place. Thus, we next appended the fluorescent probe nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) to the Nterminus of IIQ via a \u03b2-alanine spacer to generate IIQ NBD and monitored its cellular uptake. IIQ NBD was found to be similar to IIQ in terms of its \u03b1-helicity and inhibitory potency against IAV infection, indicating that the addition of the fluorophore did not dramatically affect the biophysical/ biological properties of IIQ (Supporting Information, Table  S4 ). To demonstrate cellular uptake, MDCK cells treated with IIQ NBD were observed after incubation for 0.5, 1, and 4 h by confocal microscopy. The lysotracker probe specifically fluoresces in acidic vesicles. 52 As shown in Figure 5 , MDCK cells exposed to IIQ NBD for 0.5 h showed that the lipopeptides were distributed on the periphery of the cell membrane.

We found that IIQ inhibited HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion with an EC 50 of 3.63 \u00b1 0.54 \u03bcM and exhibited low cytotoxicity, with CC 50 > 100 \u03bcM, on the TZM-b1 cell that was used for the fusion assay.

To our knowledge, the formation of a hexameric coiled-coil complex is believed to be a common element in type I fusion events. However, the fusion rates vary significantly between viruses from different families, between viruses within a family, and even between isolates of the same species, thus leading to the different window periods during which inhibitory peptides access to the target fusion protein and thereby impacting entry inhibitor efficacy. 5 Furthermore, the stability of the corresponding fusogenic 6HB of different type I viral fusion proteins was also correlated with the inhibitory potency of peptides. 7 Therefore, the engineered lipopeptides with simple repeating units of the heptad in our study could not be effective against all of the class I viruses entry, but first provide a proof-of-concept prototype for broad-spectrum antiviral agents design.

One of the designed peptides showed a high potency against MERS-CoV infection and effectively neutralized H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (influenza A group 1), H3N2 ",

The relatively broad-spectrum antiviral peptides were designed based on the secondary structure at the hexameric coiled-coil complex interface. We anticipate that this approach could also be extended to other pathogenic viruses with class I fusion proteins because they undergo fusion catalysis in a manner similar to that of MERS-CoV and IAVs. to the reactor; the reaction was stirred at room temperature for 60 min. After completion of the coupling reaction or Fmoc removal, the resin was washed with DMF (5 \u00d7 1 min) and DCM (3 \u00d7 1 min). For lipopeptides, the template peptides containing a Dde-protected lysine residue at their C-terminus required a special deprotection step (four 3 min washes of 2% hydrazinehydrate in DMF). This enabled the conjugation of a palmityl moiety, which was performed by the addition of 3 equiv of palmic acid, 3 equiv of HBTU, and 6 equiv of DIEA in DMF to the resin, followed by stirring for 2 h. Conjugation of a fluoride [4-fluoro-7-nitrobenzofurazan (NBD)] fluorescent probe to the N-terminus of the peptide was performed by the addition of 6 equiv of NBD-Cl dissolved in DMF together with 6 equiv of DIEA to the peptide resin, followed by stirring for 12 h. The peptides were cleaved from the resin and deprotected with reagent K, which contained 85% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% thioanisole, 5% m-cresol, and 5% water. The carboxyl termini were amidated upon cleavage from the resin, and the amino termini were capped with acetic acid anhydride, except NBD-conjugated peptides. All lyophilized crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase highperformance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC; Shimadzu preparative HPLC system), and the purity of each peptide was confirmed to be \u226595% by analytical RP-HPLC (Shimadzu analytical HPLC system). Such information is provided in the Supporting Information (Table S5\u2212 Inhibition of Pseudotyped MERS-CoV Infection. Inhibition of MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection was assessed using a previously described method. 42 Briefly, the serially diluted tested peptides were added to a 96-well plate and incubated with MERS-CoV pseudovirus for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Then, the pseudovirus/peptide mixture was added to the Huh-7 cells. Cultures were refed with fresh medium at 12 h postinfection and incubated for an additional 48 h at 37\u00b0C. Fluorescence was determined using a luciferase kit (Promega) and an Ultra 384 luminometer (Tecan).",

The final peptide concentration in each preparation was 75 \u03bcM. Left panel:Peptides were electrophoresed in a 15% native polyacrylamide continuous gel at pH 3.4.

Right panel: Peptides were loaded on a 15% Tris-glycine gel with Tris\u2212glycine running buffer (pH 8.8). IIQ alone showed no band in the gel, probably because the pH of the gel buffer is only slightly higher than the isoelectric point value of IIQ, thus it carries few net charges and cannot migrate into the gel.

Rink amide resin, with a resin loading of 0.44 mmol/g, was selected as the solid support. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), dichloromethane (DCM), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), methanol, piperidine, and other reagents used in the reaction process were anhydrous reagents or dried prior to use. The synthetic steps were as follows:(1)The resin was first swelled in a reaction vessel by the addition of 5 mL of DMF and 5 mL of DCM, followed by stirring for 20 min. (2) The Fmoc protecting group was removed using 20% piperidine/DMF. The deprotection reaction was performed twice; the first reaction was 5 min, and the second reaction was 2 min.(3) The next amino acid was coupled with the addition of 5 mL of amino acid solution (0.25 M), 5 mL of condensing reagents [0.2 M Obenzotriazole-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU)/DMF and 0.2 M 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt)/DMF], and 5 mL of active base solution [0.4 M N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA)/DMF]",

The 293T/EGFP cells expressing only EGFP were employed as negative control cells. Huh-7 cells were plated in 96-well plates (5 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well) at 37\u00b0C for 5 h. Then, serially diluted peptide samples were added, followed by the addition of 293T/MERS/EGPF cells or 293T/EGFP cells (1 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well). After coculturing at 37\u00b0C for 4 h, the 293T/MERS/EGFP cells and 293T/EGFP cells, either fused or unfused, with Huh-7 cells were counted under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti-S).",
