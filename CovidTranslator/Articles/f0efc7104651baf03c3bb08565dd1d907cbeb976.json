Materials and methods: It is a retrospective, observational, and multicenter study conducted in 16 tertiary PICUs in Turkey includes a total of 302 children with viral cause in the nasal swab which required PICU admission with no interventions. Results: Median age of patients was 12 months. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was more common in patients over one year of age whereas influenza, human Bocavirus in patients above a year of age was more common (p <0.05). Clinical presentations influencing mortality were neurologic symptoms, tachycardia, hypoxia, hypotension, elevated lactate, and acidosis. The critical pH value related with mortality was \u22647.10, and critical PCO 2 \u226560 mm Hg. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that patients with neurological symptoms, tachycardia, hypoxia, hypotension, acidosis, impaired liver, and renal function at the time of admission exhibit more severe mortal progressions. Presence of acidosis and multiorgan failure was found to be predictor for mortality. Knowledge of clinical presentation and age-related variations among seasonal viruses may give a clue about severe course and prognosis. By presenting the analyzed data of 302 PICU admissions, current study reveals severity of viral respiratory tract infections and release tips for handling them.",

Besides the known agents, recently new generation viruses including human metapneumovirus (HMPV), coronavirus, and bocavirus have also been lead to cause these manifestations. 4, 5 In this study, it is aimed to bring out the clinical characteristics of patients who had viral infections requiring PICU admission during winter season in Turkey.",

In comparison with the numerical values of multiple groups, ANOVA was used for variables with normal distribution and Kruskal Vallis test was used for variables with no normal distribution. Comparison of categorical variables was carried out by chi-square test and Fisher Exact test. The most effective presenting finding on mortality was revealed with regression analysis. Multivariate regression analysis was performed for determining mortality risk factor. Critical pH and pCO 2 value were found with the ROC curve. ROC analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between blood pH and mortality. The p-value <0.05 was considered as significant.

The median PRISM score was 22 (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) and median PELOD score was 11 (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) in patients with influenza. The median PRISM score was 9 (3-17) and median PELOD score was 10 (1-15) in patients with the viruses other than influenza (p <0.005). The relationships between the indication of PICU admission, organ failures at the time of admission or revealed at follow-up, and species of viruses isolated are shown in Table 4 . Among all, 60.2% of patients received antiviral therapy, 94.3% antibiotic therapy, 15.8% antifungal therapy. 47.4% of patients who died, and 61.6% of the patients discharged received antiviral therapy (p = 0.22). The median duration of stay on MV was 4 (2-5) days, median duration of stay in PICU was 7 (4-15), and median duration of hospital was 15 (10-27) days in patients who received antiviral therapy. The median duration of stay on MV was 3 (2-5) days, median duration of stay in PICU was 7 (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) , and median duration of hospital was 15 days in the patients who did not receive antiviral therapy (p >0.05). It was found that virus species did not affect mortality between patients who received and did not receive antiviral therapy (Table 5) . Of all, 92.3% of patients required respiratory support treatments. Renal replacement therapy was performed in 6.6%, plasma exchange in 5.2%, and ECMO in 1.9% of patients.",

            "text": "Viral respiratory tract infections are the most common infections worldwide. They are the most important cause of mortality in all age groups, particularly in children. 7 This retrospective observational study was conducted in order to analyze the course of seasonal viral infections of respiratory tract in patients hospitalized in PICUs of 16 centers representing the whole country. There are a bunch of studies in literature investigating the relationship between viruses and morbidity, comparison of single-multiple viruses or relationship between diseases and viruses. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Current study is multi-directional and has comprehensively analyzed all these issues in a very large population requiring PICU. Viral respiratory tract infections constitute significant proportion of patients admitted to PICUs in winter, and these patients require advanced intensive care support with high mortality and morbidity rates. In line with this, our study group shows a very high mortality rate as 7.6%, which supports the justification of this multicenter survey. Although respiratory tract viruses commonly cause lower respiratory tract infections, presentation with extrapulmonary clinical manifestations are also likely in children under one year of age. 8, 19 Similarly, the most common cause of hospitalization was respiratory symptoms in our study. Fever, neurological symptoms, circulatory disorders, and shock were more common indications for hospitalization in patients under one year compared to older children (Table 2 ). In patients over one year of age presenting with respiratory symptoms, hypoxia as well as a need for MV were more common. We attributed this situation to RSV, which was more frequently observed in this age group. In the literature, RSV is more prevalent in infancy for PICU admission though influenza and bocavirus that was more common in our patients less than one year of age. 1, 9, 10 We statistically evaluated all initial symptoms (clinical, laboratory, and radiological) and virus species through four parameters (duration of stay on mechanical ventilation (MV), duration of stay in PICU, duration of hospitalization, and mortality). Accordingly, we assessed relationship among presenting symptoms, virus species, and severity of disease. It was observed that presenting symptoms that have an effect on mortality were neurologic symptoms, hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxia. It was also found that liver and renal function test abnormalities, higher lactate values were related with death. Eighty-seven percent of mortalities are presented with acidosis ( Table 1 ). The critical pH value related with mortality and critical PCO 2 was \u22647.10 and \u226560 mm Hg, respectively. In regression analysis, acidosis alone was found to increase mortality by 2.5 folds. In the light of these findings, it can be predicted that patients with neurological symptoms, tachycardia, hypotension, low levels of pulse sO 2 , acidosis, and impaired liver or renal function at the time of admission will have a higher morbidity and mortality.",

We found that antiviral therapy did not affect mortality (Table 5) including the influenza subgroup. Though, there are studies in literature showing that oseltamivir initiated in the early period was effective. [37] [38] [39] However, weakness of our study is that the data we gathered is not capable of differentiating the initiation timing for antiviral therapy. Further studies are needed for this issue. Influenza is already known as the only agent that benefits from oseltamivir. When we separately evaluated the influenza subgroup, we found the median patient age as 41 months and higher PRISM and PELOD scores compared with rest of the viral agents. Influenza was more common in older children and progressed more severely. Therefore, oseltamivir can be preferred in children especially over one year of age and who presented with more severe symptoms because they are more likely to have influenza.",

It was found that acidosis increased mortality by 2.5-folds and MODS by 20-folds. Respiratory symptoms were common and besides respiratory symptoms, incidence of circulatory disorders and shock findings were also high in patients less than one year of age. Fever, tachycardia, neurologic symptoms, the incidence of anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, impaired renal tests, and electrolyte imbalance were high in patients less than one year of age. Consequently, acidosis and MODS at the time of admission or a patient less than one year of age with symptoms mentioned above should alert clinicians for a possible poor prognosis. Although we could not show the relationship of virus type with severity and mortality, RSV, parainfluenza, and influenza were the commonly isolated viruses in the patients who died. Coronavirus was found as the most lethal virus. Although coronavirus is known as the primary agent of upper respiratory tract infection and common cold, this result of our study can be attributed to the incidence of secondary bacterial infections being high in the patients with coronavirus detected. With this context, further studies are needed to investigate the relationship between coronavirus and mortality.",
