While such structures have been actively studied and replicated in the laboratory, it remains unclear whether they can be used for biomedical applications. Here we show a transparent photonic nanostructure inspired by the longtail glasswing (Chorinea faunus) butterfly and demonstrate its use in intraocular pressure (IOP) sensors in vivo. We exploit the phase separation between two immiscible polymers (poly(methyl methacrylate) and polystyrene) to form nanostructured features on top of a Si 3 N 4 substrate. The membrane thus formed shows good angle-independent white light transmission, strong hydrophilicity and anti-biofouling properties that prevent adhesion of proteins, bacteria, and eukaryotic cells. We then developed a microscale implantable IOP sensor using our photonic membrane as an optomechanical sensing element. Finally, we performed in vivo testing on New Zealand white rabbits and show that our Users may view, print, copy, and download text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use: http://www.nature.com/authors/editorial_policies/license.html#termsReprints and permission information is available online at www.nature.com/reprints.",

            "text": "Herein, we seek inspiration from the multifunctional biophotonic nanostructures found on the transparent wings of the longtail glasswing (Chorinea faunus) butterfly to advance the versatility of micro-optical implants whose practical use is often limited by the angle dependency of sensing and readout processes 14, 15 as well as short-and long-term biofouling [15] [16] [17] . We characterised in detail the surface and optical properties of the shortrange-ordered nanostructures found on the C. faunus butterfly wings that could overcome the shortcomings of micro-optical implants. We reveal that C. faunus relies on relatively moderate-aspect-ratio (aspect-ratio \u2248 1) chitin nanostructures to produce (1) transparency that is a unique combination of wavelength-selective anti-reflection and angle-independent transmission resulting from isotropic Mie scattering, and (2) antifouling properties through disruption of cellular growth similar to that observed on high-aspect-ratio (aspect-ratio > 1) structures found in nature 12, 13 . Drawing our inspiration from the C. faunus nanostructures, we created low-aspect-ratio (aspect-ratio < 1) bio-inspired nanostructures on freestanding Si 3 N 4 -membranes using a highly-scalable phase-separation-based polymer-assembly process. Unlike previous high-aspect-ratio bio-inspired nanostructures replicating antireflection 9, 12, 13 , we engineered the pseudo-periodic arrangement and dimensions of nanostructures to control isotropic scattering and enhance omnidirectional optical transmission, which could benefit sensing and readout processes of micro-optical implants. In addition, improving from the anti-biofouling properties of high-and moderate-aspectratio nanostructures that typically rely on physical cell lysis 12, 13, 18 , we engineered the lowaspect-ratio nanostructures to generate strong nanostructure-mediated hydrophilicity and anti-adhesion barrier for proteins and cellular fouling without inducing cell lysis and inflammation.",

We have discovered that the C. faunus wings are distinct from most other transparent wings in nature 9, 11, 22 . They have a rare combination of two transparent regions that transmit light differently: (1) the basal transparent areas close to thorax (indicated by a blue arrow in Fig.  1a) ; and (2) the postdiscal transparent areas further away from the thorax (indicated by a red arrow in Fig. 1a ) of both the forewing and hindwing. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the postdiscal transparent area (Fig. 1c ) reveals dome-shaped nanopillars with moderate aspect-ratios (1.090 \u00b1 0.041; Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. S1 ), compared to other natural transparent wings with higher aspect-ratios (>1) [10] [11] [12] . Interestingly, the basal transparent area is composed of similarly shaped nanostructures at a lower density (Fig. 1d) . The two-dimensional fast Fourier transforms of the SEM images showed ring-shaped distributions (insets of Fig. 1c and 1d ), which confirmed their shortrange-ordered arrangements 11, 23 . The finite diameters of the rings in k-space quantified the average periods of the nanostructures as 140-180 nm and 200-300 nm for the postdiscal and basal areas, respectively.",

The postdiscal area with an average period below 200 nm remains scattering-free and anti-reflective in the ultraviolet (UV)-visible (VIS)-near-infrared (NIR) regime, and this is well-explained by the effective medium theory and the transfer-matrix model as in other anti-reflective subwavelength nanostructures found in nature 11, 24 (Supplementary Fig. S2 ). The basal area with an average period exceeding 200 nm comparable to light wavelengths shows forward narrow-angle scattering due to more sparsely-located, moderate-aspect-ratio low-index nanostructures 25, 26 . Our finite-difference time-domain simulations performed on both groups of nanostructures for 420-nm wavelength produced matching results that confirmed the scattering mechanism of the basal area ( Fig. 1e-f ). Although we used the same structural height and diameter for both groups in the simulations, the nanostructures with a 150-nm period (similar to the postdiscal area) did not alter the transmitted field (Fig. 1e) , whereas nanostructures with a 300-nm period (similar to the basal area) showed forward scattering of the transmitted light (Fig. 1f) . The scattering phenomenon of the basal region is moreover confirmed by the difference observed between the specular transmittance and total transmittance in the VIS-NIR range shown in Fig. 1h .",

On the other hand, the basal area scattered light in the forward direction with scattering angles up to \u00b112\u00b0 and showed negligible changes with incident angle variation, demonstrating its potentially very useful angle-independent scattering property (Fig. 1j) . This scattering property could ameliorate the difficulty of detecting optical signals at wide angles, a commonly observed challenge among many lightbased devices 14 such as implantable IOP sensors 15 (See Supplementary Section SI1 and Fig.  S3-S4 for more details on the biological significance of the multifunctional transparency  and its dual nano-structural basis present on C. faunus wings.) Additionally, the periods of the nanostructures on C. faunus wings also influence the wetting properties, and the static contact angles in the postdiscal and basal areas measured 105\u00b0 and 85\u00b0, respectively. The contact angle in the postdiscal area is larger due to the higher surface roughness 27 .

Such anti-biofouling approaches relying on physical lysis could undesirably damage tissues surrounding implants and elicit inflammation. Supplementary Table S1 shows physical lysis occurs on either natural or synthetic nanostructured surfaces if the aspect-ratio of the nanostructures is 1 or greater. Hence, by keeping the aspect-ratio of the nanostructures at 0.45, the anti-adhesion property was leveraged to prevent biofouling without causing any physical lysis.

The angle independence enhanced by the nanostructure integration improved the stability and accuracy of the optical measurements against potential error sources such as respiratory movements, subtle eye motions, and detector misalignment.

Additionally, matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) was used as an indicator of inflammation for its role in various inflammatory and repair processes 49 . Fig. 5e and 5f show the top views of the z-stacked multi-channel immunofluorescence images of the flat-surfaced and the nanostructured sensors, respectively. Approximately 59% of the flat-surfaced sensor was covered by tissue, and the presence of a vast filamentous Factin network (Fig. 5e , in green) indicates healthy tissue growth at the time of extraction. Additionally, MMP-2 (Fig. 5e , in red) was observed over the membrane of the flat-surfaced sensor, which could have triggered the extensive cell migration towards this region. In comparison, approximately 5% of the nanostructured surface was covered by tissue, which was a 12-fold improvement over the flat-surfaced sensor, and there was no detectable MMP-2 signal, suggesting the cell signalling and migration patterns present on the flatsurfaced sensor were absent on the nanostructured sensor. This indicates no inflammation occurred post-implantation and highlights the promising role of the nanostructures towards significantly improving in vivo biocompatibility of medical implants.",

By tuning the key physical dimensions of the nanostructures, we have engineered structurally-induced scattering that expands an optical readout angle and improved antifouling with supressed inflammation suitable for IOPsensing implants. In Glaucoma, accurate IOP monitoring is the only mainstay of disease diagnosis and management 47 , and optical sensing approaches for IOP monitoring have been promising in terms of miniaturization, energy efficiency and frequency of monitoring 15 ; however they also require improvement in readout angle and biocompatibility for practical use. The integration of the nanostructures on an IOP-sensing implant significantly expanded its detection range while reducing mean in vivo IOP error by 3-folds. Further, the nanostructures effectively suppressed biofouling and inflammation by 12-folds, resulting in a highly practical implant for long-term IOP monitoring. Further development of our bioinspired work, including continuous IOP monitoring using mobile devices with an integration of features such as memory-based tracking 50 , will improve glaucoma treatment outcomes and lower the risk of visual impairment and blindness. With these promising results, we envisage numerous medical technologies and devices will benefit greatly from the multifunctionality of biophotonic nanostructures.",

A layer of water-rich solution is formed at the air solution interface due to the difference in evaporation rate between water and MEK. Water starts to condense from the air into the solution because of the evaporation of MEK, which decreases the temperature on top below the dew point. Because of the high water concentration, a 3-dimensional phase separation occurs between PS/MEK and PMMA/MEK/water.

Upon spontaneous unfolding, the haptics were positioned into the iridocorneal angles. A custom-built hand-held detection system was used for the in vivo IOP measurements from the nanostructured IOP sensor. The system was interfaced with a high-resolution NIR mini-spectrometer (Maya200 Pro, Ocean Optics) and a portable tungsten halogen light source (HL-2000, Ocean Optics). To obtain a single IOP measurement, spectra were captured for a 60-seconds period with an integration time of 10 milliseconds per spectrum, resulting in 6000 spectra. Many of these measurements are influenced by naturally induced respiratory and subtle eye motions of the rabbits, which cause the angle of incidence to deviate from normal and increases error. Hence, 100 representative reflection spectra with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were chosen out of 6000 spectra and used to calculate the IOP. An in-house IOP detection algorithm on MATLAB was used to rapidly calculate the IOP based on the peak locations of the captured reflection spectra (Fig. S15 ). Rebound tonometry was performed using a hand-held off-theshelf system (TonoVet).",

(T1) The top substrate fabrication begins with 2 \u00b5m-thick SiO 2 and 400 nm thick Si 3 N 4 layers deposited on the top and bottom surfaces of a double-side-polished (DSP) Si wafer (thickness: 300 \u00b5m) using thermal oxidation and low pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD), respectively. (T2) The Si 3 N 4 and SiO 2 layers on the top surface of the wafer were completely removed using reactive ion etching (RIE) (Plasmalab System 100 RIE/ICP, Oxford Instruments, Inc.) and buffered oxide etch (BOE). Next, a 300 nm-thick Al oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) layer was deposited using an e-beam evaporator (FC-1800 E-Beam Evaporator, Temescal) and patterned the surface using photolithography and BOE. (T3) Using the patterned Al 2 O 3 layer as a hard mask, the wafer was etched using a Bosch process (Plasmalab System 100 RIE/ICP, Oxford Instruments, Inc.) down to the SiO 2 etch stop at the bottom surface of the wafer. (T4) The SiO 2 layer was removed through BOE to create freestanding Si 3 N 4 -membranes. The nanostructuring process described in the previous section was used to structure the Si 3 N 4 -membrane. (T5) Individual nanostructured membranes were released from the substrate through photolithography and RIE from the backside. (B1) The bottom substrate fabrication begins with a double-side-polished Si wafer (thickness: 300 \u00b5m). (B2) Using a photoresist mask, a precisely controlled 4 \u00b5m recess was created through RIE to generate the FP cavity gap. (B3) Next, a 300 nm-thick Al 2 O 3 layer was deposited using an e-beam evaporator and patterned. (B4) Using a single Bosch process, concentric shallow trenches and a deep trench were etched. The shallow trenches were created to serve as reservoirs during the epoxy bonding process to prevent any of the adhesive from overflowing into the FP cavity. The deep trenches were created for the easy separation of bottom chips (bottom parts of the sensors) from the wafer. (B5) The Al 2 O 3 masking layer was removed in BOE. Finally, a medical grade epoxy was applied along the sides of the top nanostructured membrane chip and the bottom chip to create a hermetically sealed FP sensor implant.",
