He presented with a 3-day complaint of fever of 38 C and a cough that had become productive. A chest film was unremarkable, and he was discharged home. The following day, he visited the hospital's emergency room with the same complaints. The oxygen saturation on room air and chest film was normal, and he was discharged home on oral cefuroxime. Two days later, he returned to the emergency room with worsening dyspnea and required continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to maintain oxygenation. Chest film revealed patchy infiltrates in his right lower lobe. Treatment with parenteral ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and oral oseltamivir were commenced after specimens were collected for diagnostic testing. He became progressively more hypoxic over the next 24 hours. Chest film revealed patchy infiltrates in his right lower lobe. Routine bacteriology, acid-fast bacillus smears, and screening influenza exams were negative. He further deteriorated and required intubation and mechanical ventilation.",

The viruses have crown-like spikes on their surfaces and hence the name coronavirus. Human coronaviruses, enveloped RNA viruses, are not new and were first identified in the mid-1960s. There are four virus clusters within the Coronavirinae subfamily. These are alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, and gammacoronavirus. The fourth cluster is a provisionally assigned new group called delta coronaviruses. All known human coronaviruses belong to the genera Alphacoronavirus (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and Betacoronavirus (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and SARSCoV). 3 MERS-CoV, formerly HCoV-EMC, is the first human coronavirus in lineage C of the Betacoronavirus genus. 3 ",

            "text": "The main infection control measures to prevent the transmission of MERS-CoV include contact isolation, standard precautions, droplet isolation, and airborne infection isolation precautions especially when healthcare workers perform aerosol generating procedures. 20 Droplet precautions include wearing a medical mask when in close contact (within 1 meter) and upon entering the room or cubicle of the patient. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends placing patients with suspected or confirmed MERS-CoV infection in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). 21 If an AIIR is not available, the patient should be transferred as soon as is feasible to a facility where an AIIR is available. Pending transfer, place a facemask on the patient and isolate him/her in a single-patient room with the door closed. 21 Performing hand hygiene in accordance with the World Health Organization's (WHO) 5 moments of hand hygiene is of paramount importance and could not be stressed more. Additional measures include wearing a particulate respirator when performing aerosol-generating procedures in addition to other precautions. In a recent MERS-CoV outbreak in a healthcare setting, there was evidence of person-to-person transmission and the outbreak was aborted by the implementation of infection control measures. 4 ",
