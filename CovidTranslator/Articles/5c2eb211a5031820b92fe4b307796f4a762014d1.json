            "text": "In Saudi Arabia, a beta new coronavirus was isolated for the first time at the end of 2012 from a patient who presented with acute community acquired pneumonia [1] . He died 11 days later from progressive severe respiratory failure and acute renal failure (ARF) and his sputum sample was negative for respiratory viruses commonly tested. Epidemiology of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was expanded after exploring the large hospital outbreak in Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia [2] . Subsequently, the virus was designated as MERS-CoV [3] . The geographic distribution of the cases has been mainly linked to the Arabian Peninsula particularly from Saudi Arabia where most of the cases were reported [4] [5] [6] [7] . However, in some countries in North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia, the disease has been detected in some travelers from endemic countries [3, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . The initial occurrence of MERS-CoV was thought to have particular predominance for male patients and those with comorbid diseases. The male-tofemale ratio was between 2.8:1 and 3.3:1 [2, 6] ; this male predominance might have been related to the nature of the outbreak. Initial cases were reported among elderly patients with a median age of 56 years. MERS-CoV has a very high mortality rate, and complications arising from infection can result in severe respiratory and renal failure [2] . Symptoms of MERS-CoV range from mild upper respiratory symptoms to rapidly progressive severe pneumonia requiring intubation, and multiorgan failure. A significant number of patients may present with nonrespiratory symptoms such as headache, myalgia, and gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting [2, 14] . This study describes the demographic, clinical characteristics, and outcome of MERS-CoV in Al-Madinah region, Saudi Arabia.",

A case was confirmed as having infection if MERS-CoV real-time polymerase chain reaction was positive, using the recommended sampling technique (nasopharyngeal swab and tracheal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage in intubated patients). Extraction of RNA was performed with Roche MagNa Pure LC (RNA viral isolation Kit). Samples were pretreated with lysis according to the manufacturer's instructions [15] . We obtained data about demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, laboratory results, diagnosis, incubation period, smoking history, comorbidities, and history of contact with camels or MERS-CoV positive patients in regions within the Madinah area. We recorded the duration of the patient's illness, microbiological test results, and reviewed imaging and treatments received. We also recorded the following outcomes: duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, and survival during hospitalization until the patient is discharged from hospital.",

In our study, only five healthcare employees acquired infection from documented contact with an infected patient, but another 24 patients were coming from areas around Al-Madinah; the largest number of infected patients was from the Alhenakia area, where camels are prevalent. The second important mode of transmission is person-toperson transmission (travelers returning from the Middle East and close contacts with MERS-CoV cases) [19] . This type of transmission was confirmed by genome sequencing of MERS-CoV [19] and isolates from the Al-Hasa healthcare-associated outbreak [16] . In the UK, MERS-CoV was transmitted to a family member who visited a patient with confirmed infection and another report from France described patient-to-patient nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV. In our study, five (18%) patients had transmission through close contact. Approximately 30% of MERS-CoV patients in our study reported diabetes and CKD, which is similar to those from other observational epidemiological studies in Saudi Arabia [2, 16] . The high mortalities reported early were probably due to a delay in the diagnosis and presence of comorbidities [20] . However, the large number of MERS-CoV cases and CKD might have been based on the Al-Hasa hospital outbreak, which mainly happened in the dialysis center [2] . We may consider the existence of chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, and CKD increasing the risk of acquiring this infection and categorize them as a high risk group for more complications and worse outcome as was revealed [21] also in our study.",

It seems difficult to conclude that one negative sample is enough to rule out MERS-CoV disease when a patient presents with respiratory symptoms and history of exposure. It is also not clear whether nasopharyngeal samples might be superior to throat samples or whether virus is shed more abundantly later in the course of the illness as it is in SARS.
