            "text": "Access to health care based on need rather than ability to pay was the founding principle of the Canadian health-care system. Medicare was born in one province in 1947. It spread across the country through federal cost sharing, and eventually was harmonised through standards in a federal law, the Canada Health Act of 1984. The health-care system is less a true national system than a decentralised collection of provincial and territorial insurance plans covering a narrow basket of services, which are free at the point of care. Administration and service delivery are highly decentralised, although coverage is portable across the country. In the setting of geographical and population diversity, long waits for elective care demand the capacity and commitment to scale up effective and sustainable models of care delivery across the country. Profound health inequities experienced by Indigenous populations and some vulnerable groups also require coordinated action on the social determinants of health if these inequities are to be effectively addressed. Achievement of the high aspirations of Medicare's founders requires a renewal of the tripartite social contract between governments, health-care providers, and the public. Expansion of the publicly funded basket of services and coordinated effort to reduce variation in outcomes will hinge on more engaged roles for the federal government and the physician community than have existed in previous decades. Public engagement in system stewardship will also be crucial to achieve a high-quality system grounded in both evidence and the Canadian values of equity and solidarity.",

Layer one comprises public services (those that Canadians recognise as Medicare): medically necessary hospital, diagnostic, and physician services. These services are financed through general tax revenues and provided free at the point of service, as required by the Canada Health Act. Coverage is universal in this single-payer system. The most important quality of this layer is relatively equitable access to physician and hospital care. 16 Another benefit is cost containment: within Canadian publicly funded insurance plans, administrative overhead is extremely low-less than 2%-because of the simplicity of the single-payer scheme. 17 Layer two services are financed through a mix of public and private insurance coverage and out-of-pocket payments, and include provision of outpatient pre scription drugs, home care, and institutional long-term care. Provinces and territories each have a diverse mix of public programmes in this layer, without any national framework. For example, in some provinces, such as Ontario, all senior citizens older than 65 years have public prescription drug coverage, whereas in others, such as British Columbia, drug coverage is income tested. 18 Layer three services are financed almost entirely privately and include dental care, outpatient physio therapy, and routine vision care for adults when provided by nonphysicians. 3 Approximately 65% of surveyed Canadians have private supplemental health insurance, mostly through their employers. 19 This insurance covers some or all of the costs of layer two and three services, notably outpatient prescription medicines, generally with copayments or deductibles. 20 An additional 11% of people have access to supplemental services through government-sponsored insurance plans. 19 However, many Canadians do not have supplemental insurance, with provincial estimates ranging from a quarter to a third of the total population. 19, 21 These individuals have to pay out of pocket for outpatient medicines, counselling services (when provided by non-physicians), and more. Such spending has been steadily increasing, particularly for low-income Canadians. 14 More than CAN$6\u00b75 billion in household funds was spent on pharmaceuticals alone in 2014. 18 The large number of Canadians who do not have access to supplemental insurance has led to concerns about equity, fuelling calls for public coverage of a wider range of services than are currently available in layer one.",

Currently, these data inform the strategic directions of health ministries and support excellent health services research in most provinces. Unfortunately, their use for operational purposes to drive front-line improvements has been scarce. Data are seldom provided in real time to organisations and providers delivering care because of the prioritisation of privacy, data security, and the difficulties involved in provision of just-in-time data from large administrative databases. 30 The ease of innovation scale-up that should in theory characterise a single-payer environment remains underrealised. 31, 32 In Canada, the rate of adoption of electronic medical records increased from about 23% of health-care practitioners in 2006 to an estimated 73% in 2015. 33 Nonetheless, hospital-based systems and primary care systems are commonly designed in isolation from each other. This separation makes information sharing difficult as patients move through distinct parts of the system that use different electronic tools unlinked to each other, causing further fragmentation of care.",

The Canadian version is the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), an intergovernmental body that provides evidence-informed funding recom mendations as to which drugs and technologies should be publicly covered. However, unlike most international health technology assessment organisations, CADTH's outputs are advisory only. Although regional health plans made coverage decisions consistent with these recommendations in more than 90% of cases between 2012 and 2013, manufacturers must nonetheless navigate 13 provincial and territorial labyrinthine approval processes even after receiving CADTH sanction. 32 Furthermore, 85% of private plans provide coverage for all prescriptions, including those that CADTH rec ommends against, with the result that evidence-informed recommendations do not necessarily cross the publicprivate divide. 34 The context for change",

At present, more than one in five Canadians are foreignborn. 55 Canada welcomed nearly 325 000 immigrants and refugees in 2015, representing just under 1% of the total population. 56 Most immigrants and refugees settle in one of the country's three biggest cities-Toronto, Montr\u00e9al, or Vancouver. 57 Despite the Canadian commitment to multiculturalism and a general historical pattern of strong immigrant integration into Canadian society, the health status of many migrant groups often differs from that of Canadianborn patients. [58] [59] [60] Newly arrived economic immigrants are typically healthier than the general population, but this so-called healthy immigrant effect declines over time, partly because of the stresses of integration, and it is not found across other classes of migrants. 61 Recent immigrants are twice as likely to have difficulty in accessing care than are Canadian-born women and men, and seek primary care less often than either established immigrants or the Canadian-born population. 62, 63 However, with longitudinal data controlling for individual propensity to seek care, immigrants are no more likely to be without a regular doctor or report an unmet health-care need than is the Canadian-born population. 64 For refugees, challenges are more prevalent and complex. 65 Language is the most commonly cited reason for difficulty in accessing care among many categories of migrants, whether they are newcomers or established. 55 Availability of inter pretation services and adequate use of those services, along with appropriate training for health-care providers and increased health and legal literacy for newcomers to Canada, would pave the way for improved access to context-sensitive care (panel 4). 65, 66 Policy challenges",

            "text": "Governments have experimented with wait-time guarantees, focused programmes, and targeted spending in priority areas such as cancer care, cardiac care, and diagnostic imaging, with varying degrees of success. For example, all provinces achieved wait-time benchmarks in radiation oncology in 2016, but long elective MRI wait times remain largely unchanged over the past decade, despite substantial growth in the number of machines purchased and scans done. 73, 74 The high degree of physician autonomy in Canada does little to encourage doctors to join organised programmes to reduce wait times. Successful models exist, such as the Alberta Bone and Joint Health Institute in Calgary, which reduced wait times for consultation for hip and knee replacement from 145 days to 21 days through inno vations including interprofessional teams and centralised referral. 75 However, physicians have competing responsi bilities, and there is no systemic support for their involve ment in system change. If a government or regional health authority wants physicians to participate in such an initiative, it must often rely on exhortation or simply pay its doctors more to gain their involvement. Poor federalprovincial-territorial collaboration also hinders the ability to scale up such successful responses to wait times across provincial borders, hence the characterisation of Canada by at least one former Minister of Health as a \"country of perpetual pilot projects\". 76, 77 Canada's reasonable performance on composite quality metrics such as amenable mortality suggests that these wait times for elective care do not necessarily translate to worse health outcomes. 78 However, for the Canadian public, long wait times for elective care are a lightning rod issue and threaten to undermine support for Medicare. Some groups have turned to the courts as a means of challenging the public-private payment divide. Relying on the constitutional Charter of Rights and Freedoms, major lawsuits in Quebec and British Columbia have argued that various provisions of provincial laws, including those that prevent privately financed care, are at the root of public wait times and threaten the right to security of the person. [79] [80] [81] [82] Little more than a decade ago, the Quebec government responded to the Supreme Court of Canada's Chaoulli decision by allowing private insurance for a few types of surgical procedures, but this outcome did not create a viable private market for a health insurance duplicative of Medicare. 83 A more ambitious lawsuit impugning prov incial Medicare laws was launched in British Columbia in 2016. 84 Unlike the Quebec trial, which sought only to overturn limits on private duplicative insurance, the plaintiffs in the Cambie Surgeries Corporation case in British Columbia seek to also overturn restrictions on user fees and on physician dual practice. 85 In the past decade, Canadian courts have made important judgments on several other major questions of health-care delivery, including the legalisation of safe injection sites, reinstatement of insurance coverage for refugee claimants, and legalisation of medical assistance in dying. [86] [87] [88] These decisions have generally increased access to care for vulnerable people. However, should the court in the Cambie Surgeries Corporation case establish a legal right for Canadians of means who wish to jump the public queue, this case could fundamentally reshape Medicare laws across the country and could threaten equitable access to care. If Canadians are unable to find ways to change the system from within through clinical and political leadership, there is a risk that changes will be forced by the courts, which are a blunt instrument for making policy change.",

In the Canadian case, marginalisation took the forms of Indian Residential Schools, government-enforced relocation, and historically segregated Indian hospitals, to name a few. 93, 94 Three distinct and constitutionally recognised groups-First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis-constitute 4\u00b73% of the Canadian population and experience persistent health disparities relative to the non-Indigenous population, including higher rates of chronic disease, trauma, interpersonal and domestic violence, and suicide, as well as lower life expectancy and higher infant mortality rates. [95] [96] [97] For example, Canada's infant mortality rate dropped by 80% from more than 27 deaths per 1000 livebirths in 1960, to five per 1000 livebirths on average in 2013. 98 However, the estimated rate in Nunavut (the northern territory in which approximately 85% of the population is Inuit) was more than three times the national rate at 18 deaths per 1000 livebirths in 2013. 98 Other far-reaching inequities exist in the social determinants of health that even the best health-care systems cannot redress. Indigenous Canadians face substantial wage gaps of up to 50% compared with non-Indigenous groups, after adjustment for education and age. 99 Persistent racism and social exclusion permeate not only the health-care but also the education and justice systems, with subsequent disparities in high school education rates, incarceration rates, and other factors often driving egregious health statistics. 100 These challenges are not evenly distributed: figure 3 illustrates the proportion of the population that is Indigenous by province and territory. Due in part to higher fertility rates in the Indigenous population than in the general population, by 2036, a projected one in five people will be an Indigenous person in the western provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba. 101 A dizzying array of services in the health-care system, including federal programmes, provincially provided services, and highly bureaucratised add-ons, together continue to fail to meet the needs and constitutional rights of Indigenous people. 102 Indigenous people are covered by provincial Medicare plans, but some onreserve health-care services fall under federal jurisdiction, and many Indigenous people receive supplemental insurance through the federal government.",

Seven of the 94 calls to action in the report refer directly to steps required to address the inequities in health. From recognising and valuing traditional Indigenous healing practices to training Indigenous doctors and nurses and setting measurable goals to close gaps in access to healthcare services, the TRC calls to action address crucial themes, many of which are rooted in self-governance. The newly established First Nations Health Authority in British Columbia, which is self-governed and communitydriven, is an example of the type of emerging model intended to address the demand for self-governance in the administration and delivery of culturally safe and responsive services for Indigenous people in Canada. 103 The remaining TRC calls to action, should they be implemented, would help to reduce disparities in the social determinants of health, leading to better healthcare outcomes.",

At a few key times in Canadian history, the federal government has overcome decentral isation and fragmentation by setting a national vision for health care and investing politically and financially in that vision. In an era in which Canada is reasserting its commitment to progressive values on the international stage, 7 health care represents a key domestic opportunity to recommit to the core Canadian values of equity and solidarity. 104 The movement to expand the scope of the public basket of services is at the heart of this approach, and we support mounting calls for universal prescription drug coverage 105 as well as expanded home care, 106 long-term care, 106 and mental health services 107 to be included in layer one of the financing system. Royal Commissions as far back as the 1964 Hall Commission 108 and as recent as the 2002 Romanow Commission 109 have clearly articulated the need for this expansion. In particular, debates about a socalled Pharmacare system are gaining needed momentum, as multiple economic evaluations have suggested that improved access through an expansion of public coverage is possible at lower overall costs. 110 As the Quebec experience illustrates, it is difficult for any one province to begin alone as Tommy Douglas did in Saskatchewanfederal cost sharing and stewardship will be required at an early stage to achieve the savings as well as the coverage and quality goals of Pharmacare. 111 With respect to wait times, solutions will continue to be based in local innovations, but the infrastructure for national spread and scale-up requires active federal involvement. One possible approach, recommended by a federally commissioned panel on health innovation, would be a Healthcare Innovation Fund intended to accelerate the spread and scale-up of promising innovations. 32 A constructive partnership between the federal government and Indigenous peoples could overcome one of Canada's most difficult challenges-the very poor health outcomes of Indigenous peoples. Newly established principles guiding the relationship between the Government of Canada and Indigenous peoples, as well as the launch of a new federal Ministry of Indigenous Services established in August, 2017, could set the tone for renewed terms of engagement. 112 This commitment to selfdetermination will mean supporting new models of selfgovernance within and beyond the health-care sphere, with a particular focus on healing from inter generational trauma and a strengths-based, wellness-focused approach to enhancing the social determinants of health. Canada's considerable experience with decentralised models of health-care delivery should allow for such innovation, and the opportunity must be seized with more urgency.",

Furthermore, expanded public coverage of prescription medications will necessitate a drive towards more evidence-informed and value-based prescribing. Canadian physicians are well situated to constructively contribute to such efforts to define value and help to shift behaviour. As founders of evidence-based medicine and important contributors to global medical research, Canadian physicians must help to lead the necessary research and debates on change within the health-care system. 117 They are critical partners in ensuring quality, consistency, and availability of services. 27 Medical associations in at least two provinces have recognised the importance of system stewardship in the practice of professionalism and have committed to health system reform in collaboration with governments. 118, 119 The Canadian Medical Association's renewed strategic plan places patients at the core of its mission. 120 And leaders in medical education have embraced a social accountability mandate and are actively working to train the \"right mix, distribution, and number of physicians to meet societal needs\". 121 This approach is a model with potential broad international application.",
