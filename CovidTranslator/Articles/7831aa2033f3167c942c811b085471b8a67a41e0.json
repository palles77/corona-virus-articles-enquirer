Gene targeting studies have distinguished four main effector pathways of the IFN-mediated antiviral response: the Mx GTPase pathway, the 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate-synthetase-directed ribonuclease L pathway, the protein kinase R pathway and the ISG15 ubiquitin-like pathway. As discussed in this Review, these effector pathways individually block viral transcription, degrade viral RNA, inhibit translation and modify protein function to control all steps of viral replication. Ongoing research continues to expose additional activities for these effector proteins and has revealed unanticipated functions of the antiviral response.",

The type II class of IFN comprises the single IFN\u03b3 gene product that binds the IFN\u03b3 receptor (IFNGR) complex, and mediates broad immune responses to pathogens other than viruses. The more recently described type III IFNs include three IFN\u03bb gene products that signal through receptors containing IFNLR1 (IFN\u03bb receptor 1; also known as IL-28Ra) and IL-10R2 (also known as IL-10R\u03b2). So far, little is known about the type III IFNs, although they are known to regulate the antiviral response and have been proposed to be the ancestral type I IFNs 3 . Type I IFNs, which in humans comprise 13 IFNa subtypes, IFN\u03b2, IFN\u03ba, IFN\u03b5, IFN\u03bf, IFN\u03c4 and IFN\u03b4, engage the ubiquitously expressed IFNAR (IFNa receptor) complex that is composed of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. The function of type I IFNs is well characterized and they are known to be essential for mounting a robust host response against viral infection. Accordingly, IFNAR-deficient mice have increased susceptibility to numerous viruses but maintain resistance to other microbial pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes 4, 5 . Similarly, humans with genetic defects in components of the IFNR signalling pathway (STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1), TYK2 (tyrosine kinase 2) or UNC93B) die of viral disease, with the defect in IFNAR (rather than IFNGR) signalling having the more significant role [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

However, relatively few of these ISGs have been directly implicated in instigating the antiviral state. Instead, many of the gene products encode pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect viral molecules and modulate signalling pathways, or transcription factors that form an amplification loop resulting in increased IFN production and protection from virus spread to limit disease. Nevertheless, some ISGs encode proteins with potential for direct antiviral activity, including proteins that catalyse cytoskeletal remodelling, that induce apoptosis, that regulate post-transcriptional events (splicing, mRNA editing, RNA degradation and the multiple steps of protein translation) and proteins that are involved in subsequent post-translational modification. Indeed, several such proteins, ISG15 (IFN-stimulated protein of 15 kDa), the GTPase Mx1 (myxovirus resistance 1), ribonuclease L (RNaseL) and protein kinase R (PKR; also known as EIF2aK2), have been shown to function as antiviral effectors in studies of knockout mice. Mice with mutations or deficiencies in key steps of the pathways that are triggered by these proteins have increased susceptibility to viral infection.",

However, although these four proteins are known to be important in the Nature Reviews | Immunology antiviral response, they do not represent the complete repertoire of antiviral effectors. Additional ISGs that probably also have important roles in antiviral activities include: the deaminases ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific 1) and APOBeC (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide) proteins; the exonuclease ISG20; members of the tripartite-motifcontaining (TRIM) proteins such as TRIM19 (also known as PML); the putative S-adenosyl-l-methionine viperin; and the highly IFN-induced translation regulators IFIT1 (IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1) and IFIT2. All of these ISGs have been reported to function as antiviral proteins in vitro but further investigation using the appropriate gene knockout mouse models is needed for a better understanding of their relative importance in the antiviral response. In addition, responses elicited by IFN-induced microRNAs are just emerging as regulators of viral infection 11 . ISG15, the Mx proteins, the 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (oAS)-directed RNaseL pathway and PKR have varying responsiveness to type I IFNs: ISG15 is one of the most highly induced ISGs and, when coupled to protein substrates, it modulates numerous cellular activities; Mx proteins are also highly induced by type I IFNs and then assemble into oligomers that are constitutively active; oAS proteins are expressed at low levels in unstimulated cells, and are considerably induced by type I IFNs produced in response to viral RNA; and PKR is constitutively expressed as an inactive kinase that is activated by viral RNA, then further upregulated by type I IFNs. This variable responsiveness to IFN also underlies the function of each protein as solely an IFN effector, or as PRRs to enhance the IFN response.",

The equivalent diglycine residues within this motif in ubiquitin are adenylated and conjugated by a thiolester bond to cysteine residues of three enzymes, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and a ubiquitin ligase enzyme (E3), before being transferred to lysine residues on protein substrates. As the ubiquitin E1 enzyme (UBE1) is unable to form a thiolester bond with ISG15, ISGylation was initially thought to require a parallel and distinct pathway 15 . However, having identified the enzymes that catalyse ISGylation, it is now becoming clear that there is direct interplay between ubiquitylation and ISGylation. The enzyme UBE1L (E1-like ubiquitin-activating enzyme) was shown to be the specific ISG15-activating enzyme (Ref. 16) . Challenging this specificity, two E2 ubiquitinconjugating enzymes, UBCH6 (also known as UBE2E1) and UBCH8 (also known as UBE2L6) were also shown to serve as ISG15 carriers 17, 18 . Downregulation of UBCH8 expression by RNA interference indicated that UBCH8 functions as the main E2 ISG15-conjugating enzyme in HeLa cells 19 . Finally, two E3 ubiquitin ligases, HERC5 (homologous to the E6-associated protein and IFNAR2 binds type I IFNs; the interleukin-10 receptor 2 (IL-10R2) associates with IFNLR1 (IFN\u03bb receptor 1) to bind the three IFN\u03bb subtypes; and a tetramer consisting of two IFNGR2 (IFN\u03b3 receptor 2) chains and two IFNGR1 chains binds dimers of the type II IFN\u03b3. Following binding by type I IFNs, signal transduction is initiated by pre-associated tyrosine kinases (JAK1 and TYK2 (tyrosine kinase 2)), which phosphorylate IFNAR1 and leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). STAT heterodimers associate with IFN-regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), or STAT homodimers to form the IFN\u03b3 activation factor (GAF). These complexes translocate to the nucleus to induce IFN-stimulated genes from IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) or GAS promoter elements, for type I and type III, or type II IFN responses, respectively. Divergence from this simplified signalling pathway can occur, for example, type I IFNs are reported to elicit STAT homodimers, and more complicated interplay, with activation of other STAT proteins, occurs than is shown here.

As with ubiquitylation, ISGylation is reversible and several enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of ISG15 (termed deISGylation) have been identified, including ubiquitin-specific protease 18 (USP18, also known as UBP43), USP2, USP5, USP13 and USP14 (RefS 22, 23) .

Unlike ubiquitylation, ISGylation does not promote degradation of the target protein (as occurs following K48-linked ubiquitin), but instead parallels the activating effects of ubiquitylation (mediated by K63linked ubiquitin). Accordingly, ISG15 has been reported to prevent virus-mediated degradation of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), thereby increasing the induction of IFN\u03b2 expression 27 .

            "text": "Consistent with its designation as an antiviral protein, mice deficient in ISG15 have increased susceptibility to infection with several viruses, including the influenza A and B viruses, Sindbis virus, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and murine \u03b3-herpesvirus 33, 34 . In addition, infection of Ifnar1 -/mice with a recombinant chimeric Sindbis virus expressing ISG15 protected against the Sindbis-virus-induced lethality that occurs following infection with wild-type virus 33 . Compellingly, this protective effect of ISG15 expression required the conserved LRLRGG sequence at the C terminus of ISG15 (Ref. 35) . In contrast to these reports, however, a similar chimeric ISG15-expressing Sindbis virus did not rescue Ifnar1 -/mice from Sindbis-virus-induced lethality, although it did provide modest protection in vitro 36 . Ablation of the deISGylation enzyme USP18 in mice increased their resistance to viral infection, notably to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection. However, the expected reciprocal increased sensitivity to VSV has not been observed in either Isg15 -/or Ube1l -/mice 37 . Isg15 -/mouse embryonic fibroblasts were, however, more susceptible to VSV The C-terminal UBL encodes conserved hydrophobic patches, charged pockets (indicated by vertical bars) and diglycine residues similar to ubiquitin and other ubiquitin-like proteins. Accordingly, the C-terminal UBL is sufficient for activation and transfer of ISG15 to E1 and E2 enzymes. However, the N-terminal UBL seems to be necessary for E3-mediated conjugation to protein substrates. b | The distinguishing features of the dynamin protein family of Mx GTPases are the large GTPbinding domain (DYNc) that contains three consensus GTP-binding elements (not indicated) and a self-assembly sequence (SAS), the central interactive domain (CID), and the C-terminal leucine zipper (LZ). The LZ region contains a coiled-coil (CC) domain at its C terminus that forms bundles of a-helices involved in protein-protein interactions. c | The 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), OAS2 and OAS3 proteins contain 1, 2 or 3 copies respectively, of the OAS domains. Duplicated OAS domains in OAS2 and OAS3, and the single domain in OASL (OAS-like) are catalytically inactive (shown in red). The C-termini of all the OAS proteins are variable, with OASL also encoding a unique UBL domain. The OAS domain produces 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylates that activate ribonuclease L (RNaseL). RNaseL has eight N-terminal ankyrin repeats (ANK), which mediate proteinprotein interactions, and two kinase-like domains, a Ser/Thr/ Tyr kinase (STYKc) and a PUG domain that are found in some kinases and several other nuclear proteins. However, neither domain has functional kinase activity. d | Protein kinase R (PKR) contains two repeated RNA-binding motifs (RBMs), which together constitute the N-terminal RNA-binding domain. On binding of viral RNA, steric inhibition of enzyme activity is relieved, leading to the activation of the C-terminal serine/threonine protein kinase domain (S/T-kinase). infection, although this sensitivity was lost after type I IFN treatment, suggesting that circulating IFNs in vivo may obscure some viral resistance mechanisms 27 16, 40 . Finally, several viral proteases from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, equine arteritis virus, porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus, and Sindbis virus have been found to mediate deISGylation [41] [42] [43] .",

RNA degraded by RNaseL can activate the other cytoplasmic PRRs, such as RIG-I and MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5), resulting in the induction of type I IFN gene expression.

OAS1 has two spliced forms in humans (eight in mice) that produce two proteins of 40 and 46 kDa that differ at their C termini by 18 and 54 amino acids, respectively. OAS2 produces four alternatively spliced transcripts that encode two proteins of 69 and 71 kDa. OAS3 encodes a single transcript that produces a 100 kDa protein. These proteins have considerable homology to each other, with oAS1, oAS2 and oAS3 encoding one, two and three oAS domains, respectively (fIG. 2) . The most distinctive of the oAS proteins is oASL. Two OASL transcripts are expressed, which produce two proteins of 30 and 59 kDa. The higher molecular weight oASL protein contains a putative nuclear-localization signal (RKVKEKIRRTR) at its C terminus that probably accounts for its unique distribution in the cell compared with the other oAS isoforms. The oASL protein also has an oAS domain, but mutations at key residues disable its catalytic function. Interestingly, one of the two mouse homologues of oASL retains its 2\u2032,5\u2032-polymerase activity. In addition to the oAS domain, oASL has a unique 160 amino-acid C terminus that encodes a ubiquitin-like domain that is homologous to ISG15. Accordingly, oASL becomes conjugated through ISGylation to cellular proteins following the treatment of cells with type I IFNs 71 .",

The active dimeric enzyme then degrades single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) 80, 81 (fIG. 5) . owing to their perceived common effect on RNaseL, the antiviral function of the oAS proteins has been investigated using RNaseL-deficient mice 82 . These mice show increased susceptibility to RNA viruses from the Picornaviridae, Reoviridae, Togaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, orthomyxoviridae, Flaviviridae and Retroviridae families 78 . An antiviral role for RNaseL against DNA viruses is less directly established, although as these viruses produce dsRNA replicative intermediates they can induce the production of 2\u2032,5\u2032-linked oligomers. However, activation of RNaseL following binding of 2\u2032,5\u2032-linked oligomers is less commonly observed in response to DNA viruses, presumably because of virally encoded inhibitory factors, such as the E3L protein from vaccinia virus 83 .

PKR belongs to a small family of protein kinases that respond to environmental stresses to regulate protein synthesis (the other members are EIF2a\u039a1 (also known as HRI), EIF2aK3 (also known as PERK) and EIF2aK4 (also known as GCN2)). Members of this kinase family phosphorylate EIF2a at serine residue 51, resulting in sequestration of the limiting guanine-nucleotide exchange factor EIF2\u03b2 (Ref. 88 ). This prevents recycling of GDP, halting translation, and therefore allows the cell to reconfigure gene expression. Much of the antiviral and antiproliferative activities of PKR can be attributed to its phosphorylation of EIF2a. Moreover, structural determination of the complex of EIF2a and PKR argues against the existence of alternative substrates 89 . However, there is extensive biological and biochemical evidence for alternative PKR targets, although the consequences of PKR-mediated phosphoregulation of other proteins have not been well characterized. As well as directly regulating proteins by phosphorylation, PKR induces cellular responses by modulating cell-signalling pathways (discussed below).",

Under normal circumstances, PKR is maintained as an inactive monomer, through steric hindrance of the kinase domain by its N terminus 91, 92 (fIG. 2) . This repression is released by activating ligands, including viral RNAs, polyanionic molecules such as heparin 93 or ceramide 94 , and protein activators 95 , which elicit a conformational change that allows binding of ATP to the C-terminal kinase domain. The kinase domain consists of two lobes that separately regulate the interaction between protein monomers and the substrate. The active PKR enzyme consists of a homodimer orientated in a parallel, Figure 5 | The oAS1-Rnasel antiviral pathway. 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) is expressed at low constitutive levels and is upregulated by type I interferons (IFNs). OAS1 protein accumulates in the cell cytoplasm as an inactive monomer. Following activation by viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the enzyme oligomerizes to form a tetramer that synthesizes 2\u2032,5\u2032oligoadenylates that, in turn, activate the constitutively expressed inactive ribonuclease L (RNaseL). The binding of 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylates to RNaseL triggers the dimerization of enzyme monomers, through their kinase-like domains, and this then enables RNAseL to cleave cellular (and viral) RNAs. ISRE, IFN-stimulated response element. back-to-back arrangement, with the active sites of the enzyme facing outwards 89 . Dimerization induces, and requires, autophosphorylation at several key residues [96] [97] [98] . Activation of PKR following dimerization then leads to the phosphorylation of EIF2a to halt translation (fIG. 6) . Direct activation of PKR has been shown with various RNAs by virtue of the two RNA-binding motifs (RBMs) in the N-terminal of PKR. All RBMs that have been tested bind dsRNA independently of sequence, but recognize a specific higher ordered structure. Accordingly, PKR, similar to the oAS-RNaseL pathway, functions as a PRR. Although RBMs have been shown to bind to just 16 base pairs of RNA, longer RNA moieties are required to engage both of the RBMs in PKR and to activate the kinase function 99 . Consequently, dsRNA that is longer than 30 base pairs activates PKR most effectively. Also, ssRNAs of 47 bases that have limited ternary structure activate the kinase if they contain 5\u2032-triphosphates 100 . As cellular RNA transcripts predominantly have 5\u2032-monophosphates, this enables PKR to specifically target viral RNAs.",

            "text": "Given that PKR modulates several signalling pathways, a broader function than that determined solely by regulation of translation would be expected. As mentioned above, PKR is required for TLR4-mediated apoptosis in macrophages. Although PKR-mediated apoptosis is in part attributable to inhibition of translation through EIF2a phosphorylation, alternative signalling through IRF3 is also important 101 . PKR also promotes degradation of the inhibitor I\u03baB, thereby activating the potent transcription factor NF-\u03baB 128 . Regulation of NF-\u03baB by PKR accounts for the diminished expression of nitric-oxide synthase 2 and IFN\u03b2 by PKR-deficient cells 129 . In addition, PKR was shown to be required for LPS-induced STAT-mediated inflammatory signalling 130 . There is also a defect in IFNinduced phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT1 (Ref. 131) , which was shown to be necessary for the basal expression of caspase-3. Accordingly, PKR-deficient fibroblasts are variably resistant to apoptosis that is induced by different stimuli, including dsRNA, LPS and TNF 132 . Conversely, overexpression of PKR in NIH3T3 fibroblasts sensitizes them to apoptosis 103 . PKR may also influence the adaptive immune response by negatively regulating CD8 + T-cell function, as PKR-deficient mice have increased contact hypersensitivity responses and stimulus-dependent T-cell proliferation 133 . PKR has also been implicated in IgE class switching in B cells. This points to a mechanism by which viral infection might induce IgE-mediated disorders, such as allergy and asthma 134, 135 . Surprisingly, these signalling events are not wholly mediated by direct phosphorylation by PKR, suggesting that it might act as a scaffold to bridge signalling pathways from alternative PRRs 136 . The mechanisms underlying these links to adaptive immunity are intriguing but remain to be explained.",

Further details of the mechanisms of action of each of these effectors are still to be elucidated. Considerable work is still required to decipher the processes of ISGylation, to characterize protein substrates and to detail the consequence for the antiviral response. Also, the precise function of the Mx proteins remains uncertain. The contribution of alternative PKR substrates (besides EIF2a) to the immune response is poorly explored, and questions remain about specific roles for PKR in regulating inflammatory responses, in particular whether this requires kinase function or its putative role as an adaptor protein. The precise roles of the different oAS proteins, especially relating to RNaseL-independent antiviral effects, are ill-defined. These alternative functions will be better addressed in vivo by the analysis of mice with more subtle targeted mutations, and in vitro by detailed biochemical analyses (for example, by identification of specific phosphorylation sites on substrates for PKR) and by more detailed structural investigation of the mechanism of activation of each protein.",

It should be noted, however, that many of the mechanisms attributed to virus-evolved avoidance of antiviral effectors and enhanced virulence have not been rigorously proven. An exception to this is the mechanism used by the HSV-1 protein ICP34.5 for targeting PKR. In this case, a virus that has been attenuated by the deletion of ICP34.5 only replicates as efficiently as wild-type virus when it infects PKR-deficient mice. Restoration of virulence was shown to depend on ICP34.5 by using both host and viral mutants 139 . Although this approach is not trivial to replicate, it remains the most valid method for defining effective viral avoidance of type I IFN activity.",

Following stimulation with type I interferons (IFNs), MXA (myxovirus-resistance A) gene expression is induced through an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) in the gene promoter. The MxA protein accumulates in the cytoplasm on intracellular membranes (such as the endoplasmic reticulum, ER) as oligomers formed by association between the leucine zipper (LZ) domain and central interactive domain of the protein. Following viral infection, MxA monomers are released and bind viral nucleocapsids or other viral components, to trap and then degrade them.",

Similarly, ubiquitylation of the HIV-1 proteins Gag and Tsg101 is inhibited by ISG15 (Ref. 39). Ubiquitylation of NEDD4 and Gag or Tsg101 mediate the release of virions from cells. Further corroboration of an antiviral role for ISG15 comes from the identification of viral proteins that have evolved to target different steps of ISGylation. Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza B virus binds ISG15 at the N-terminus and blocks ISGylation",
