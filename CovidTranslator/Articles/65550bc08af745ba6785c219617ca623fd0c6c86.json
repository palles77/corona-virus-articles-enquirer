Previous research has shown that higher temperatures led to lower virus survival rates in the laboratory. We develop a model of survival of HeV in the environment as influenced by temperature. We used 20 years of daily temperature at six locations spanning the geographic range of reported HeV incidents to simulate the temporal and spatial impacts of temperature on HeV survival.",

Survival was higher in microhabitats with lower than ambient temperature, and when environmental exposure was shorter. The within-year pattern of virus survival mirrored the cumulative within-year occurrence of reported HeV cases, although there were no overall differences in survival in HeV case years and non-case years. The model examines the effect of temperature in isolation; actual virus survivability will reflect the effect of additional environmental factors.",

            "text": "Hendra virus (HeV) was first described in September 1994, associated with an outbreak of novel acute respiratory disease in horses in a training stable in Brisbane, Australia Baldock et al. 1996) . It resulted in the deaths of 14 horses and their trainer, and caused a febrile illness in a second stable worker . To date, 90 horses and seven people are confirmed or suspected to have been infected with HeV in 48 reported incidents (http://www.daff.qld.gov.au/animal-industries/an imal-health-and-diseases/a-z-list/hendra-virus/generalinformation/what-is-hendra-virus, accessed 4 December 2013). Fruit-bats of the genus Pteropus (commonly known as flying-foxes) are the natural host of the virus (Halpin et al. 2000; Field 2005) . While the incidence of infection is low in both horses and humans, the high case fatality rate (*80% in horses, *60% in humans) Playford et al. 2010 ) engenders a high level of concern in horse-owners and trainers, veterinarians, para-veterinary professionals and the general public. All human cases have been associated with close contact with infected horses (Playford et al. 2010) , so minimising the risk of infection in humans is predicated on minimising infection in horses. Horses are putatively infected following mucosal contact with infectious flying-fox excreta or body fluids Halpin et al. 2000) . While a vaccine for horses has recently become available (http://www.qldhorsecouncil. com/Hendra-Virus/Hendra-Vaccine.aspx, accessed 4 August 2013), uptake has been limited, with a little over a quarter of the estimated horse population at risk in eastern Australia having been vaccinated to 30 October 2013, notwithstanding encouragement from government, the veterinary profession and the horse industry.

Thus, emphasis remains on reducing horse exposure to infection.",

We used data from this previous study and from our own laboratory study to develop a simulation model of the effect of temperature on HeV survival in the environment. We used the model to explore implications of relative HeV infection risk under a number of practical scenarios-specifically, at different latitudes, in different years, at different times of year and in different microclimates. Additional environmental factors undoubtedly influence HeV survival in the environment, but a lack of empirical data precluded their inclusion in the model.",

We used data from the first 4 days of each month for simulations. The change in temperature was simulated as a cosine wave with the minimum temperature being at 3 a.m. and the maximum at 3 p.m. At each hour, the breakdown rate for that temperature was applied. It is acknowledged that on particular days, the minimum and maximum temperatures may occur at times that differ from this and that there may be departures from a cosine wave during any particular day. However, this simplification is unlikely to alter our results in any meaningful manner. Data on hourly temperature are not readily available for the span of years, nor for the six HeV incident locations which we used in our model (Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton (all Queensland), Murwillumbah and Kempsey, New South Wales- Fig. 3 ).

The general pattern in HeV survival shows a decline over the 4-day simulation period, with the rate of decline being most rapid in summer and least in winter, as illustrated by the Rockhampton data (Fig. 5a) . Other months showed intermediate patterns of decline (data not shown). The ranking of the locations in terms of HeV survival remains the same over the 4-day simulation period (Fig. 5b) .

The monthly pattern of HeV survival in the environment at 24 h after excretion (Fig. 8b) follows the general cumulative monthly occurrence of equine HeV cases reported in eastern Australia (Fig. 8a) . One apparent anomaly is the absence of reported equine cases during March and April, when simulated survival during this period is very similar to that during the October-December period. The other notable feature is that the peak in cases during June-July-August is more pronounced than the increase in survival of HeV at this time of year.

While (for logistical purposes) we limited this study to detailed consideration of six locations, all reported incident locations are effectively within this gradient, thus our findings have broad relevance. The identified between-location trend of increasing virus survival from north to south was not unexpected, given the decreasing mean temperature gradient. Similarly, the seasonal association with virus survival was not unexpected, reflecting the within-year temperature profile. However, the magnitude of within-location temperature variability (and subsequent differences in survival- Table 2 ) over the 20-year period was quite large and may offer a fundamental insight into the spatially sporadic nature of equine HeV cases. Temperatures conducive to substantial HeV survival can occur in any of the locations used in this study and in many/most months of the year.",

However, the difference is surprisingly modest and less than the variation in survival between years for excretion at a single timepoint. This simulation was prompted by a common horse-owner query regarding a 'safe' time to return horses to a paddock where flying-foxes were active overnight. Our findings preclude a definitive answer to this question on the basis of temperature alone. Clearly, exposure risk decreases with temperature over time, but other environmental factors also influence risk. HeV is very sensitive to desiccation (Fogarty et al. 2008) . Multiple environmental factors contribute to desiccation (rainfall, humidity, UV index, microclimate) and undoubtedly influence HeV survival in the environment as well, but a lack of empirical data precluded their inclusion in our parsimonious model. In addition to environmental factors, ecological (Plowright et al. 2008 ) and husbandry factors (Kung et al. 2013 ) may also influence exposure risk.",

If HeV survival in an organic medium (fruit debris, spats, faeces) is greater than in urine, and if these organic media also buffer virus from desiccation [another environmental factor influencing virus survival in experimental studies (Fogarty et al. 2008) ], then such material further prolongs virus survival. This rationale ratifies recommended risk management strategies to remove horse food and water points from underneath trees, to cover horse feed and water points, and to exclude horses from grazing underneath trees in which flying-foxes are feeding.",

The former closely reflects the latter, indicating a strong correlation between lower temperature and infection risk. Such a correlation is biologically plausible, given that lower temperatures extend virus survival time, which in turn increases the 'window of opportunity' of effective exposure for a horse. While the findings of Fogarty et al. (2008) suggested such an association, their experimental study was limited to two temperature points. Our model is based on additional data using real temperature data from real case locations, adding support to that putative association. The absence of reported cases to date in the (Australian) autumn months of March and April, when the temperature profile is similar to that of spring months (in which cases have been reported) can plausibly be explained either by chance, or by the additional negative influence of other seasonal factors on virus survival. The occurrence of the first reported February case in 2013 supports the former, and the likelihood is that cases will eventually be reported in all months. The more pronounced peak of cases June to August is consistent with the presence of additional risk factors at this time, or alternatively may reflect the unprecedented mid-year cluster of cases in 2011.",

We found no consistent difference between case years and non-case years suggesting that, while temperature may be an important factor in virus survival, other factors are needed to constitute sufficient cause for effective transmission to horses. This putative complex causality has been previously discussed in seeking an association between virus excretion prevalence in flyingfoxes and equine cases. They suggest that sufficient cause (in addition to the presence of virus) may include unidentified host, agent and environmental factors.",

The intent was not to illustrate actual survivability, but rather relative survivability and thus relative exposure and infection risk for horses. Figure 5 indicates that theoretically, up to 30% of virus may remain in the environment after 4 days. This projection reflects the effect of temperature in isolation; actual survivability will be much shorter, because actual survivability will reflect the effect of a range of factors in addition to temperature. As discussed earlier, desiccation, pH and substrate are additional factors known to influence virus survival in laboratory studies (Fogarty et al. 2008) . In an environmental context, climate factors such as humidity, rainfall, wind and ultraviolet radiation intensity will undoubtedly contribute to actual HeV survival. There may well be additional, as yet unidentified, factors.",

Our simulation modelling shows, first, that virus survival varies with location and with season, and second, that factors such as the timing of virus excretion during the night and microclimate account for less variation in virus survival than does temperature variation between years. Finally, and importantly, the model shows that the effect of ambient temperature on the survival of virus in the environment mirrors both the annual clustering of HeV cases in the Australian winter, and occasional sporadic cases at other times of year. We do not contend that temperature is the sole or primary driver for infection in horses, nor that temperature alone influences virus survival in the environment, but rather that it constitutes part of a 'sufficient cause' paradigm, as previously proposed ). Further work is required to elaborate other contributing causal components.",
