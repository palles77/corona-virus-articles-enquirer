To date, there is no study from the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia determining the proportion and severity of hMPV infection among pediatric hospitalized patients with respiratory infections. Objectives: The objective of this study is to determine the presence of hMPV antigens in the nasopharyngeal secretions of pediatric patients hospitalized with respiratory tract infections in the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: This prospective, serological hospital-based study included all pediatric patients who were admitted to Aseer Central Hospital, Abha, Saudi Arabia, from July 2016 to November 2017 with upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections. Basic demographics of patients and their clinical data on and after admission were recorded. Direct fluorescent antibody assay was used to detect the presence of hMPV antigens in the obtained nasopharyngeal secretion specimens. Results: During the study, 91 pediatric patients were hospitalized due to upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections, of which 9.9% were positive for hMPV. These patients were aged 9 months to 16 years, were from Abha city or its surrounding localities and were mostly (77.8%) hospitalized during autumn or winter. The most common diagnosis on admission was bronchopneumonia (55.5%) and aspiration pneumonia (22.2%), and some patients also had underlying chronic conditions such as chronic heart disease (22.2%) and bronchial asthma (11.1%).",

            "text": "Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a single-stranded RNA-enveloped virus, recently classified in the order Mononegavirales, family Pneumoviridae, genus Metapneumovirus and species hMPV. It was first isolated in the Netherlands by van den Hoogen et al., [1, 2] and is now a known causative agent of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children and adults. hMPV infections have been reported in Australia, [3] Canada, [4] the United States, [5] the United Kingdom, [6] Hong Kong, [7] South Africa, [8] Mexico, [9] Spain [10] and Peru. [11] However, in the Middle East, there have only been few reports of hMPV infections, mainly as sporadic infections in Egypt, [12] Jordan, [13] Kuwait [14] and Saudi Arabia. [15] Along with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections, hMPV is now recognized as a primary etiologic agent for acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in pediatrics. [16, 17] In a study from Mexico, it was found that the number of hMPV infections increased in children aged 24-36 months as compared with those in younger age groups, whereas RSV infections were inversely proportional to increase in age. [9] Co-infection with both viruses can also occur, resulting in a more complicated and serious clinical disease. [3, 18] In addition to the pediatric population, studies have also found hMPV to infect adults [19] and elderly people. [20] In terms of transmission, hMPV spreads through contact with contaminated secretions, i.e., droplet, aerosol or fomites. Hospital-acquired hMPV infections have also been reported. [5] In young children, infections are usually not asymptomatic, and bronchiolitis, with or without pneumonia, is the most common associated presentation. [18, 20, 21] Other reported conditions include bronchial asthma exacerbation, otitis media, pneumonitis, flu-like illness and community-acquired pneumonia. [9] In adults, hMPV has been associated with bronchitis, pneumonia and exacerbations of both bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. [22, 23] In terms of detection, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a sensitive and commonly used method to detect hMPV. [5] Real-time RT-PCR is also commonly used for detecting hMPV in clinical specimens with many genomic target sequences. [24, 25] A touch-down genomic amplification protocol for the diagnosis of acute viral respiratory tract infections has also been used previously. [26] The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for hMPV diagnosis is a simple and specific serological test for anti-hMPV antibodies detection. [27] Immunofluorescence using specific antibodies is routinely used for detecting hMPV antigens, particularly in epidemiological studies. [28] However, cell culturing techniques have a low sensitivity in detecting hMPV from respiratory tract secretions, as the virus exhibits extremely limited types of cell tropism. [2, 10, 29, 30] In Saudi Arabia, there is a paucity of data regarding the occurrence of hMPV and its role in complicated clinical cases of commonly reported respiratory infections. Therefore, the current study aimed to determine the role of hMPV in the respiratory tract infections' severity and complications among hospitalized children in the Aseer region, where no such study has previously been conducted.",

            "text": "The results of the present study concur with several other studies demonstrating an association between hMPV infection and acute respiratory conditions such as bronchopneumonia and pneumonia. [3, 5] A previous study implicated hMPV as a causative agent for severe and acute respiratory infections among pediatric patients, [34] which is similar to the findings of the current study. Another study found that children with hMPV infection are likely to have immunodeficiency; however, the current study was not able to substantiate these findings as none of the patients were found to be immunocompromised. [13] The prevalence of hMPV infection of the current study (about 10%) was similar to that reported in studies from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. [14, 15] However, other similar studies that used direct immunofluorescence assays for the detection of hMPV antibodies in sera of patients revealed much higher prevalence rates. [35] This suggests that different results can be obtained with different diagnostic techniques for hMPV infection. In the current study, we used DFA with monoclonal antibody, which has previously been shown to have 100% specificity, thereby indicating the reliability of our results. [31] The current study did not find any gender predilection in terms of the infections; these findings are in accordance with that of Bastien et al. [4] and Kahn. [29] In this study, all nine hMPV-positive children were from Abha or its surrounding areas. These areas are known for their high altitude, low temperature and low oxygen tension. It was well known that the prevalence of viral respiratory infections is high in cold and dry areas. [36] In addition, almost 78% of the hMPV-positive cases were in children who had been admitted during the autumn and winter seasons. It is also known that the majority of the viruses responsible for bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia have their peak infectivity during winter and late autumn, with only sporadic cases through other seasons. [37, 38] The hMPV-positive patients in the current study had fever, cough, nasal congestion, cyanosis, stridor and shortness of breath, while some also had underlying chronic illnesses such as chronic heart disease and bronchial asthma; similar hMPV-associated illnesses were observed in another study. [39] Physical examination revealed wheezing and bilateral crepitation and clinically, the most common presentations were bronchopneumonia and aspiration pneumonia. These findings are in line with those of Williams et al., [40] who found significant association between hMPV and wheezing exacerbations and/or bronchiolitis in infants and young children.",
