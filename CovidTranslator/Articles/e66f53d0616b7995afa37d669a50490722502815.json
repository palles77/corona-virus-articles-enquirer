            "text": "Chronic liver disease has multiple etiologies, including viral infection and metabolic disorders. Regardless of initial causes, progression to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis requires an inflammatory component (1, 2) . The fibrogenic process is a continuous wound healing response mediated by hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and interaction between innate and adaptive immune cells (3) . Excessive wound healing due to uncontrolled hepatocyte death upon persistent hepatocellular stress results in pathologic fibrogenesis (4) . Evidence from clinical and animal studies suggests that hepatic macrophages play an important role in all stages of liver disease (5) . An important property of macrophages in liver pathology is their ability to induce hepatocellular apoptosis (6, 7) . During liver injury, resident macrophages, known as Kupffer cells (KCs) are critical in the initial stress response (4) . KCs respond by rapidly producing cytokines, including IL1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1. Inflammatory cytokine release results in leukocyte recruitment (2) . Leukocyte-derived death receptor ligand release propagates hepatocyte apoptosis, contributing to hepatopathology (1, 8) . These death effectors induce apoptosis through engaging TNF receptor superfamily members on hepatocytes (9) . Resulting hepatocyte death is central to liver pathophysiology in common disease models (7, 9) . Through this process, macrophages are known to participate in regulated hepatocyte death, contributing Hepatic fibrosis arises from inflammation in the liver initiated by resident macrophage activation and massive leukocyte accumulation. Hepatic macrophages hold a central position in maintaining homeostasis in the liver and in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic liver injury linked to fibrogenesis. Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) has recently emerged as an important proinflammatory transcription factor involved in macrophage activation under acute and chronic inflammation. Here, we revealed that IRF5 is significantly induced in liver macrophages from human subjects developing liver fibrosis from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or hepatitis C virus infection. Furthermore, IRF5 expression positively correlated with clinical markers of liver damage, such as plasma transaminase and bilirubin levels. Interestingly, mice lacking IRF5 in myeloid cells (MKO) were protected from hepatic fibrosis induced by metabolic or toxic stresses. Transcriptional reprogramming of macrophages lacking IRF5 was characterized by immunosuppressive and antiapoptotic properties. Consequently, IRF5 MKO mice respond to hepatocellular stress by promoting hepatocyte survival, leading to complete protection from hepatic fibrogenesis. Our findings reveal a regulatory network, governed by IRF5, that mediates hepatocyte death and liver fibrosis in mice and humans. Therefore, modulating IRF5 function may be an attractive approach to experimental therapeutics in fibroinflammatory liver disease.",

Traditionally, macrophages are categorized by their terminal differentiation stage: proinflammatory (M1), wound healing (M2), or immunosuppressive (M reg ). This macrophage differentiation is dependent on regulatory cascades controlled by interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) (11) . IRFs are a family of transcription factors involved in immunoregulation and immune cell differentiation through TLR signaling (12) . We have recently documented that the fifth member of the IRFs, IRF5, is expressed in myeloid cells and responsible for M1 macrophage polarization (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) . Through macrophage activation, IRF5 also elicits Th cell type 1 and 17 responses in acute and chronic inflammation (14, 18) . More recently, we demonstrated the metabolic activation of IRF5 in obesity and its involvement in adipose tissue expansion. IRF5 knockout prevents adipose tissue expansion through alternative polarization of macrophage and T cell responses (16) .",

This causal association is confirmed in mice with a myeloid deficiency of IRF5 (IRF5 MKO). IRF5 MKO mice are resistant to liver fibrosis upon carbon tetrachloride-induced (CCl 4 -induced) experimental fibrosis, under a NAFLD-like pathology induced by methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) feeding and due to cholestatic injury through bile duct ligation (BDL). Underlying this protective phenotype is an immunosuppressive polarization of IRF5-deficient liver macrophages. Consequently, hepatocytes are desensitized to death receptor stimulation, in turn ameliorating the initial response to hepatocellular stress.",

Of note, we observed no localization with endothelial cells or HSCs (Supplemental Figure 1B) . Furthermore, IRF5-and CD68-positive staining increased with the extent of liver damage and fibrosis in NASH and HCV ( Figure 1C ). Next, we investigated correlations between IRF5 mRNA levels and main liver function parameters. IRF5 expression correlated positively with plasma transaminases and bilirubin levels, and negatively with prothrombin time, indicating increased expression of IRF5 with markers reflecting liver damage ( Figure 1D ).

Chronic hepatocellular stress is induced by repeated administration of CCl 4 for induction of experimental fibrosis; or MCD feeding or BDL for induction of a NASH-like pathology or cholestatic liver injury, respectively. Following treatments, fibrogenesis was assessed by red picrosirius (RP) staining, structural damage was assessed by H&E staining, and macrophage accumulation was quantified by F4/80 + staining. We confirmed that MCD feeding leads to lipid accumulation, mild fibrosis, and macrophage accumulation; BDL leads to intermediate fibrosis, macrophage accumulation, and parenchymal necrosis, whereas CCl 4 treatment leads to pronounced fibrosis and massive macrophage accumulation (Figure 2 , A and B). In mice treated with MCD, BDL, or CCl 4 , IRF5 expression was significantly increased relative to that in untreated mice, as measured by IHC analysis. Increased IRF5 expression was concordant with severity of liver damage and macrophage (F4/80 + ) accumulation ( Figure 2B ). As we previously reported, expression of IRF5 was not modulated in liver or liver macrophages of mice fed a high-fat diet (16) (Sup-plemental Figure 2, A and B) . Interestingly, IRF5 + staining was localized to the same regions as F4/80 + staining, indicating localization of IRF5 expression to murine liver macrophages. Both IRF5 and F4/80 localized to sinusoidal regions, inflammatory infiltrates, and fibrous septa following MCD, BDL, or CCl 4 treatment ( Figure 2B ). To confirm the induction of IRF5 in liver macrophages, mRNA levels of IRF5 were quantified by qRT-PCR in liver and in hepatic macrophages (F4/80 + cells) from the same animals. IRF5 expression was induced in liver and liver macrophages following MCD, BDL, and CCl 4 treatment ( Figure  2C ). Increased expression was specific to liver macrophages, while no modulation of IRF5 was seen in hepatocytes or F4/80cells (Supplemental Figure 3, A and B) . Furthermore, IRF5 expression in macrophages correlated with several markers of disease progression, namely macrophage accumulation (F4/80 expression), plasma transaminases, and fibrosis (RP staining and Col1\u03b11 expression) ( Figure 2D ).",

Deletion of IRF5 expression in hepatic macrophages of MKO mice was confirmed by IHC, immunoblot and qRT-PCR ( Figure 3A and Supplemental Figure 4A ). We subjected MKO mice and wild-type littermates (MWT) to MCD feeding for 4 weeks, BDL for up to 10 days, and repeated CCl 4 administration for 6 weeks; the resulting hepatic phenotype was analyzed. In all models, livers from MKO mice underwent significantly less structural change (H&E staining) than those of MWT mice ( Figure 3B ). Indeed, quantification of fibrosis (RP staining) revealed decreased accumulation of collagen in MKO mice, accompanied by decreased Col1\u03b11 mRNA expression compared with MWT upon MCD, BDL, and CCl 4 treatment ( Figure 3C ). HSC activation, a major process leading to collagen deposition (20) , was also decreased in MKO mice in both models. This was evaluated by quantification of \u03b1SMA expression by IHC and qRT-PCR analyses ( Figure  3D ). The protected liver phenotype in MKO mice was reflected by decreased plasma transaminase levels in MKO mice relative to MWT mice in both models ( Figure 3B ). These results indicate a lower degree of liver damage and remodeling in MKO mice upon MCD, BDL, and CCl 4 treatment.",

Interestingly, macrophage number was strongly reduced in liver from MKO mice compared with MWT mice under all treatments, as quantified by F4/80 immunostaining and gene expression in total liver ( Figure 4A ). Furthermore, FACS analyses of liver mononuclear cells (LMNCs) revealed decreased accumulation of F4/80 + CD11b + macrophages in liver from MKO mice ( Figure 4B ). Next, we identified the polarization of the hepatic macrophage population through further gating onto the proinflammatory M1 macrophage marker CD11c and the antiinflammatory M2/M Reg macrophage marker CD206. We observed a phenotypic switch in the macrophage population, with a decrease in CD11c + macrophages and an increase in CD206 + macrophages in MKO relative to MWT mice under all treatments ( Figure 4C ). Our findings suggest that downregulation of the IRF5 pathway and subsequent antiinflammatory polarization of MKO hepatic macrophages is implicated in the hepatoprotective phenotype upon MCD, BDL, and CCl 4 treatments.",

Transcriptome analyses revealed ~1,300 differentially expressed transcripts between MKO and MWT mice. Ontological clustering and pathway analyses revealed enrichment of multiple terms among downregulated transcripts regulating apoptosis, cytokine signaling, TLR signaling, and T cell activation (Tables  1 and 2 ). As expected, the TLRs/Myd88/IRF5 pathway was downregulated in hepatic F4/80 + cells from MKO mice ( Figure 5A ). Consequently, proinflammatory genes (IL1\u03b2, IL6, MHC II, TNF) were downregulated, while antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive genes (TGF\u03b21, IL10, ARG1, CD206) were upregulated, corroborating the phenotypic switch seen with flow cytometric analyses.

Apoptosis terms were significantly enriched among downregulated transcripts in the hepatic F4/80 + cells from MKO mice. Thus, we quantified apoptotic and necrotic bodies by TUNEL assay in liver from MWT and MKO mice upon CCl 4 treatment. TUNEL + staining, histologically localized to hepatocytes, was observed in liver from MWT but not MKO mice, confirming downregulation of cell death ( Figure 5D ). Among apoptotic pathways, Fas-linked apoptosis had been highlighted through pathway analyses to be downregulated in hepatic macrophages from MKO mice ( Figure 5A ). We confirmed, by a combination of IHC and qRT-PCR, that FasL expression was reduced in liver sections and in liver macrophages from MKO compared with MWT mice ( Figure 5E ). We also revealed, through flow cytometry, that hepatic F4/80 + CD11b + macrophages from IRF5 MKO mice have defective FasL and TNF release compared with MWT mice ( Figure 5F ). Interestingly, IHC analysis had revealed similar localization of FasL-and TUNEL-positive staining, confirming hepatocytes as targets of Fas-induced apoptosis in MWT mice. These observations were corroborated by decreased expression of Fas (FasL receptor) and increased expression of the antiapoptotic genes BCL2 and BCL-X L in hepatocytes from MKO mice compared with MWT littermate controls ( Figure 5G ).",

Thus, we characterized the acute, 24-hour, response to CCl 4 administration in MWT and MKO mice. Following acute CCl 4 toxicity, we observed disruption of liver structure in MWT mice, the appearance of necrotic/apoptotic regions, and massive hepatocyte ballooning as visualized by H&E staining. This structural damage was minimal in liver from MKO mice, as corroborated by decreased plasma transaminase levels, which were strongly induced in MWT mice ( Figure 6A ). Importantly, IRF5 expression was also strongly induced in MWT after acute CCl 4 toxicity as quantified by IHC and by qRT-PCR analysis of hepatic F4/80 + cells ( Figure 6B ). Along with IRF5 induction in MWT mice, we noticed an increased accumulation of F4/80 + CD11b + macrophages in MWT but not MKO liver ( Figure 6C ). Additionally, in MKO mice accumulation of inflammatory CD11c + macrophages was reduced, while CD206 + macrophage accumulation was significantly increased. Consistent with this finding, liver macrophages from MKO mice were marked by increased expression of antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive genes, namely TGF\u03b2, IL10, and CD206 ( Figure 6D ). We also found a strong induction of TUNEL + apoptotic/necrotic bodies in MWT but not MKO liver. Apoptosis was confirmed to be Fas induced, with increased FasL + staining in MWT but not MKO liver ( Figure 6E ). Indeed, FasL and TNF release by hepatic F4/80 + CD11b + macrophages was decreased in MKO liver ( Figure 6F ), which is concordant with decreased Fas expression in hepatocytes and increased expression of the antiapoptotic genes BCL-X L and BCL2 ( Figure 6G ). Furthermore, analysis of IRF5 recruitment to DNA in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) revealed that IRF5 binds to the upstream region of the FasL gene after stimulation with LPS (Supplemental Figure 6A ). FasL mRNA expression was induced in these cells but not IRF5 MKO cells (Supplemental Figure 6B) .",

In agreement with previous observations, IHC staining and mRNA expression analysis confirmed FasL involvement in the apoptotic liver phenotype under MCD and BDL conditions.

When stratifying patients by etiology, the expression of both FasL and Fas was significantly induced in NASH and HCV but not in fatty liver or in control liver ( Figure 9A ). Similar to the expression of IRF5, the expression of both Fas and FasL increased with increasing fibrosis stage ( Figure 9B ) and was independent of steatosis (Supplemental Figure 7A) . We next investigated the correlation of Fas and FasL with several markers of liver damage and found significant positive correlations with plasma transaminases and bilirubin; in contrast, we observed negative correlations with prothrombin time, which is known to decrease with liver damage (Supplemental Figure , and BCL-extra large (BCL-X L ) mRNA expression in primary hepatocytes from MWT and MKO mice following CCl 4 treatment.

TGF\u03b2 is widely known for its profibrogenic properties; pathological effects of TGF\u03b2 in liver disease have been well documented, with several studies suggesting therapeutic intervention with TGF\u03b2 signaling (27) . However, TGF\u03b2 is also a powerful antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokine; thus, attention is increasingly paid to temporal considerations and cell type-specific effects of TGF\u03b2 signaling (25) . We have previously demonstrated transcriptional regulation of TGF\u03b2 expression by IRF5 in adipose tissue macrophages (16) . The repressive action of IRF5 on TGF\u03b2 expression is reproduced in this study, indicating consistent regulation between tissues, although the effects induced are tissue-specific.

The apoptotic process is mediated by death receptor stimulation and the formation of complexes cleaved at initiator then executioner caspases (33, 34) . Once the terminal caspase is cleaved, apoptosis is underway. Checkpoints, such as BCL2, can inhibit progression to the terminal caspase or maintain cell structural integrity through other means, thus promoting cell survival (35) . Three effector groups are involved in apoptosis: extrinsic factors (viruses, xenobiotics, etc.), immune factors (receptor ligands), and intrinsic factors (bile acids, free fatty acids, etc.) (4) . By the application of metabolic stress (MCD, BDL), toxic stress (CCl 4 ), and direct death receptor stimulation (Jo2), we have demonstrated an effector-independent mechanism that promotes hepatocyte survival through the myeloid deficiency of IRF5. IL10 and its targets are instrumental in the protective phenotype observed in IRF5 deficiency, due to the powerful antiapoptotic and antifibrogenic properties of this cytokine. Other studies have demonstrated that Sham-treated mice: n = 6 per group; Jo2-treated mice: n = 6-8 per group. Scale bars: 100 \u03bcm. Differences between genotypes determined by unpaired 2-tailed t test. All values reported as mean \u00b1 SEM. **P < 0.01,***P < 0.001. mice deficient in IL10 show an aggravated liver phenotype under experimental fibrosis relative to WT mice (36) . IL10 expression per se is sufficient to prevent hepatocyte death from caspase-dependent apoptosis by strong induction of BCL2 family members (35) . BCL2 and BCL-X L are critical factors that promote hepatocyte survival by direct interference with caspase cleavage (25, 34) . Furthermore, BCL2 family members have been subject to numerous loss-and gain-of-function studies demonstrating their requirement to maintain hepatocyte survival (37) . Indeed, under hepatocellular stress in IRF5 MKO, we demonstrate increased hepatocyte expression of BCL2 and BCL-X L concordant with increased IL10 expression from leukocytes.",

We demonstrate that altering macrophage inflammatory polarization is sufficient to ameliorate hepatic response to CCl 4 toxicity and in turn prevents experimental fibrosis. In response to Fas stimulation, IRF5-deficient macrophages undergo antiinflammatory polarization, inducing IL10 secretion from CD4 + T cells and their rapid immunosuppressive differentiation. Furthermore, upon Fas stimulation, macrophage deficiency in IRF5 renders hepatocytes completely resistant to apoptosis; this resistance has been previously demonstrated in mice with global IRF5 knockout (38) . These findings confirm that IRF5 as a key component of the inflammatory process that drives hepatocyte death in mice.",

The Figure 10 . Schematic representation of the role of IRF5 in liver macrophages in response to hepatocellular stress. Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5)-competent liver macrophages undergo proinflammatory activation in response to hepatocellular stress. Proinflammatory activation (M1) induces inflammatory cytokine and death effector release that induces hepatocyte caspase (Casp)-dependent apoptosis. Activated factors include Fas ligand (FasL), TNF, MHC II, IL6, and IL1\u03b2. Proinflammatory activation induces type 1 and type 17 responses from CD4 + T cells. Type 1 and 17 cytokines include IL17 and IFN\u03b3. In IRF5-deficient macrophages, hepatocellular stress leads to immunosuppressive (M Reg ) polarization and secretion of IL10 and TGF\u03b2. TGF\u03b2 expression induces differentiation of CD4 + T cells into CD4 + FoxP3 + T cells, which contribute to IL10 release. Secretion of IL10 in IRF5 deficiency promotes antiapoptotic signaling in hepatocytes mediated by B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family members. This process maintains cell survival under stress.",

For nuclear stains and cytoplasmic epitopes, cells were then stained with appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies in permeabilization buffer (Affymetrix eBioscience) for 20 minutes at room temperature in the dark. Cells were then washed, resuspended in flow cytometry staining buffer, then filtered at 40 \u03bcM before acquisition. LIVE/DEAD Fixable dye (Invitrogen) was used to discriminate between live and dead cells. Acquisitions were made on a BD FACSAria III (BD Biosciences).",

Reads were then aligned against the genome using STAR (version 2.4.0k) (44) , and Ensembl annotation version 81 Alignments from reads matching more than once on the reference genome were removed using the Java version of SAMtools (45) . To compute gene expression, GRCm38.p4 GFF3 genome annotation version 81 from the Ensembl database (http://useast.ensembl.org) was used. All overlapping regions between alignments and referenced exons were counted using HTSeqcount 0.5.3 (46) . The sample counts were normalized using DESeq 1.8.3 (47) . Statistical treatments and differential analyses were also performed using DESeq 1.8.3. The RNASeq gene expression data and raw fastq files are available in the GEO repository (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under accession number GSE82157. For ontological clustering of genes, the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery (DAVID) was used, and for pathway analyses the Panther classification system was used.
