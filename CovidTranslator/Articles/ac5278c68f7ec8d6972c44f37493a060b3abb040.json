In a stratified analysis, there was a trend towards higher association between FluA, hCoV and hBoV with increasing age (especially in patients aged 24-45 years and >65 year old).

This study investigated the association between influenza A viruses co-infection with hBoV and hCoV and severity and the sensitivity of a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for identification of 15 coronaviruses. Methodology Published sequences for the 15 human coronaviruses were used to design a consensus PCR targeting the replicase open reading frame 1b. A previously published PCR targeting the NS1 Gene of all known human bocavirus strains was also utilized. A series of 217 samples from patients aged 37.7 (SD \u00b1 30.4)] with seasonal influenza A viruses (SeasFluA) identified between 06/2011 and 06/2012 in NW England were tested for hCoV and hBoV using RT-PCR. Association between coinfection and disease outcome was assessed using logistic regression. Results The limit of detection of hCoV RT-PCR assay was 2 copies/\u00b5l of human coronavirus RNA template, a sensitivity comparable to a previously published SYBR green assay for human coronaviruses. A total of 12 hCoV and 17 hBoV were identified in the 217 influenza A positive samples. A higher proportion (61.5 %; 8/13) of SeasFluA/hBoV co-infections were identified in patients",

The optimum annealing temperature for the primers was 57 \u00b0C. At this temperature, the wells that contained coronavirus 229E and RNA template; gave the lowest threshold cycle (Ct value), (range 19-38), highest fluorescence signal (range 0.6-19.2), and the PCR product melted at 76.2 \u00b0C, which is within the Tm for coronaviruses PCR products (75.0 and 80.0 \u00b0C). Analytical sensitivity of the PCR assays was tested by seven 1:4 serial dilutions (10 4 -10 0 ) for the hCoV and eleven serial dilution (10 6 -10 0 ) for the hBoV. The hCoV assay was able to detect down to 2.6 copies/\u00b5l, whereas the hBoV was able to detect down to 4.9 copies/\u00b5l. Under optimum conditions, the duplicate samples gave reproducible results and the experiments were repeated three times giving a total number of 21 and 33 replicates. Our results compare well with previously published protocols of hCoV and hBoV. For example a SYBR Green RT-PCR assay for identification of hCoV, published in 2007, Escutenaair et al. [24] reported that their assay was able to detect down to 10 RNA copies/\u00b5l, whereas Vijgen et al. [25] pan-coronavirus assay (published in 2008) was far less sensitive with a lower detection limit of 5.0 \u00d7 10 3 RNAcopies per microliter sample, Adach et al. [26] (1 and 10 genome copies). Further, hBoV assay by Neske et al. [27] was able to detect up to 3.8 \u00d7 10 8 -3.8 \u00d7 10 3 copies/\u00b5l and Lu et al. [28] (10 copies). Our assays were therefore of good analytical sensitivity and could be used in diagnosis of hCoV. Polyacrylamide gel results indicated that the size of the PCR products obtained from the coronavirus 229E and bocavirus was similar to the coronavirus and bocavirus inserts into the pEX-A plasmid vector (a picture of the PAGE result for coronavirus is provided in Fig. 2) .

Therefore the clinical usability of any PCR assay for the identification of all or most coronaviruses depends on its ability to amplify a region which is common to all coronaviruses (both human and human adapted animal viruses), and its sensitivity. The primers for coronavirus we designed target the replicase ORF1b nsp15 (XendoU/NendoU) uridylate specific endonuclease gene, which is highly conserved among all coronaviruses [21, 22] and we confirmed our results with a TaqMan probe. The quality of primers depends, among others, on their ability not to give nonspecific amplifications. Our primers for identification of coronaviruses did not give nonspecific amplifications as indicated by the melting curves. In addition, the hCoV standard curve experiments indicated that the hCoV RT-PCR assay was able to pick up to 2 copies/\u00b5l of human coronavirus RNA template, our assays results compare equally with those of a previously published SYBR green assay for coronaviruses [24] [25] [26] . We are therefore confident that it could be applied for diagnosis of coronaviruses in clinical settings subject to further experiments in statistically significant number of samples.",

In this study, single seasonal influenza A viruses were predominantly in adults >18 years old in agreement with our earlier published study [35] . Similarly a higher proportion of hCoV and hBoV co-infections were in adults 18 to 65 years old. This suggests high prevalence of hCoVs and hBoV among older patients. Comparatively the majority of other respiratory virus co-infections (RSV, RV, hMPV and hPIV1-3) were in children \u22645 years old (Table 2) . Regarding seasonality of the viruses, almost all the respiratory virus single and dual infections in this study were identified in the winter season. This could be because we tested for hCoV and hBoV in samples that were positive for influenza A viruses and influenza viruses are known to circulate mainly during winter season. Our findings are in agreement with other studies [16, 36] , which also reported dual or multiple respiratory virus infections mainly occur during winter season. This study did not find a significant association between seasonal influenza A viruses co-infection with hCoV and hBoV and severe disease. Given the high co-infection rates for bocavirus reported by other studies [3, 12] , probably more bocavirus infections could have been identified if all the 3,804 samples received at the MMPL between June 2011 and June 2012 were tested. A possibility of finding more coronaviruses could also not be ruled out. A review by Schildgen et al. [3] suggested that human bocavirus may be a bystander and not a real pathogen; one of the evidence to this hypothesis being frequently identified co-infecting with other respiratory viruses, and also it is mostly identified in low copy numbers. However, the results of this study indicate a trend towards the hypothesis that hBoV coinfection might promote hospitalization especially among patients >65 years old and >24 \u226445 years old. Further, a number of other factors; age, comorbidities, immune status, and bacterial co-infection, affect disease outcome [37] [38] [39] . However in this study we did not control for these factors as the datum did not have these variables. This may have affected our outcomes and this should be born in mind when interpreting our results.",

For identification of bocavirus the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was used: reaction mixture 10 \u00b5l of Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (2\u00d7), 2.5 \u00b5l forward and reverse primer (20 \u00b5M), 2 \u00b5l RNAse free water and 3 \u00b5l of template in positive control well or sample in test wells. RT-PCR experiments were conducted on the StepOne and StepOne Plus Real Time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems) with cycling parameters for coronavirus of: 48 \u00b0C for 30 min, 95 \u00b0C for 10 min; followed by 40 cycles of denaturing at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 57 \u00b0C for 1 min; and a melting curve of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, 57 \u00b0C for 15 s and 95 \u00b0C for 15 s. The bocavirus PCR used 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min and a melting curve of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, 60 \u00b0C for 15 s and 95 \u00b0C for 15 s. The number of viral copies was calculated using the absolute quantification method published by Brankatschk et al. [23]. Confirmation of positive samples using MGB probes Samples that were positive for coronavirus or bocavirus were confirmed with a TaqMan based RT-PCR. The probe concentrations were first optimized using duplicate preparations of 10, 6.6, 5, 3.3, 0.3 \u00b5M and 0.12 probe concentrations. Each well contained 10 \u00b5l of TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (2X) (Applied Biosystems), 2.5 \u00b5l of probe, 2.5 \u00b5l forward and reverse primer, 2 \u00b5l of RNAse free water and 3 \u03bcl of RNA template. The coronavirus PCR also contained the 1 \u00b5l Multiscribe Reverse Transcriptase (Applied Biosystems) and 1 \u00b5l of RNase inhibitor. The cycling conditions were; for coronavirus experiments: 50 \u00b0C for 2 min, 95 \u00b0C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 1 s and 57 \u00b0C for 20 s; whereas for bocavirus: 95 \u00b0C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 1 s and 60 \u00b0C for 20 s. Polyacrylamide gel (PAGE) electrophoresis Amplicons for coronavirus and bocavirus PCR were visualized using precast 8 % TBE polyacrylamide gel 1 mm 15 well (Applied Biosystems) run on an XCell SureLock\u2122 Mini-Cell Electrophoresis chamber (Invitrogen Novex Mini cell), filled with 200 and 600 ml 1\u00d7 BTE Running Buffer in upper and lower chambers respectively. Ten (10 \u00b5l) of PCR product was mixed with 9 \u00b5l of Deionised water and 1 \u00b5l 5\u00d7 DNA Loading Buffer (Bioline, London) and loaded into the wells and the positive control well loaded with HyperLadder V (Bioline). The loaded XCell Sure-Lock\u2122 Mini-Cell chamber was run at 200 V, 18 mA for 35 min, stained with GelRed Nucleic Acid Stain (Biotium, Hayward, UK) for 30 min, and visualised under UV light on an Alphaimager 2200 machine (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, Calif).",

This was because the pandemic virus did not circulate in high numbers during the 2011/2012 season. The World Health Organisation (WHO) had declared the end of the pandemic on 10th August 2010 [29]. Human coronaviruses were found in 12 of the 217 samples whereas human bocavirus in 17 of the 217 samples. The Ct values for hCoV positive samples ranged from 21.95 to 35.0 (mean 31.3) corresponding to 122 and 75 copies/\u00b5l respectively, whereas for hBoV it ranged from 26.95 to 36.0 with (mean of 32.75) corresponding to 123 and 92 copies/\u00b5l, indicating low viral loads. Previous studies have also reported finding hBoV low and not high viral loads Zhenqiang et al.[12].The same samples used for identification of hCoV and hBoV were also previously tested for other respiratory virus infections: influenza B virus (Flu B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinoviruses (RV), adenovirus (AdV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and human parainfluenza virus types 1-3 (hPIV1-3). When the results of other respiratory viruses are included, 149 (72.0 %) of the 207 seasonal influenza A viruses were single infections, and more than one virus was detected in 58 (28.0 %) cases. Only 1 of the 10 patients with pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection was also infected with human coronavirus and rhinovirus. Of the 34 co-infections between seasonal influenza A and other respiratory viruses; 19 cases were infected with hMPV, 14 with RV, 2 with Flu B, 2 with RSV, and 2 with hPIV3 virus.",
