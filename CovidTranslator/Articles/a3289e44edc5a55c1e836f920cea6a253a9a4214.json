            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved gene regulatory mechanism employed by most eukaryotes as a key component of their innate immune response against viruses and retrotransposons. During viral infection, the RNase III-type endonuclease Dicer cleaves viral double-stranded RNA into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), 21-24 nucleotides in length, and helps load them into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to guide cleavage of complementary viral RNA. As a countermeasure, many viruses have evolved viral RNA silencing suppressor (RSS) proteins that tightly, and presumably quantitatively, bind siRNAs to thwart RNAi-mediated degradation. Viral RSS proteins also act across kingdoms as potential immunosuppressors in gene therapeutic applications. Here we report fluorescence quenching and electrophoretic mobility shift assays that probe siRNA binding by the dimeric RSS p19 from Carnation Italian Ringspot Virus (CIRV), as well as by human Dicer and RISC assembly complexes. We find that the siRNA:p19 interaction is readily reversible, characterized by rapid binding ((1.69 \u00b1 0.07)\u00d710 8 M \u22121 s \u22121 ) and marked dissociation (k off = 0.062 \u00b1 0.002 s \u22121 ). We also observe that p19 efficiently competes with recombinant Dicer and inhibits formation of RISCrelated assembly complexes found in human cell extract. Computational modeling based on these results provides evidence for the transient formation of a ternary complex between siRNA, human Dicer, and p19. An expanded model of RNA silencing indicates that multiple-turnover by reversible binding of siRNAs potentiates the efficiency of the suppressor protein. Our predictive model is expected to be applicable to the dosing of p19 as a silencing suppressor in viral gene therapy.",

            "text": "Over the past decade, RNA interference (RNAi) has become recognized as a benchmark laboratory and potential clinical tool to control gene expression, as well as a highly conserved eukaryotic immune response against viral pathogens or transposons. [1] [2] [3] [4] During viral infection, plant and invertebrate cells are known to activate RNAi where viral RNA is specifically recognized by the cytoplasmic RNase III-type endonuclease Dicer and degraded by an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Dicer cleaves exposed stretches of doublestranded RNA into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) 21-24 nucleotides in length (depending on species). Dicer then delivers the double-stranded siRNA via the RISCloading complex 5 to RISC, 6, 7 where the passenger strand of the duplex is cleaved and released while the guide strand is retained to guide specific cleavage of complementary viral RNA genomes or transcripts. 8, 9 Dicer is thus thought to play a critical dual role in RNAi by both generating virus-specific siRNA duplexes and assembling them with the necessary protein components into active RISC. 10 In mammalian including human cells, artificial siRNAs have been shown to confer antiviral immunity, 11 but only very recently evidence has emerged to suggest that small RNAs including siRNAs are also directly generated from infecting viruses. 12 To subvert the host RNAi response many viruses have evolved small proteins that act as RNA silencing suppressors (RSSs). 13, 14 One of the best characterized RSSs is exemplified in the plant pathogen Carnation Italian Ringspot Virus (CIRV), which encodes a 19 kDa protein termed p19, an important pathogenicity factor that is highly conserved among all tombusviruses. 14 Crystal structures 15, 16 and recent molecular dynamics simulations 17 show that homodimers of p19 bind a single siRNA duplex in a positively charged surface cleft (Fig. 1a) . Pairs of tryptophan residues stack on both terminal base pairs to establish a sequence-independent, caliper-like size selection for siRNA duplexes with 19 base pairs and 2-nucleotide long 3\u2032-overhangs. Sequestration and binding of Dicer-generated siRNAs by p19 has been observed to correlate with reduced viral RNA degradation, systemic symptom spread, and sustainability of the viral phenotype after infection. [18] [19] [20] [21] Previous electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) have suggested that the affinity of dimeric p19 for siRNA is high with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of K P = 0.17 \u00b1 0.02 nM. 15 Such tight binding is consistent with a widely accepted sequestration model wherein the p19 dimer near-quantitatively binds siRNA duplexes to suppress RNAi. 14, 18 Binding of double-stranded RNA is considered to be the most common RSS mechanism, 22 ,23 yet measurements of siRNA binding and dissociation kinetics to better understand sequestration have not been reported to date for any RSS protein.",

If binding were completely irreversible, it would require the virus to generate sufficient quantities of p19 dimer to quantitatively bind all small RNAs produced enzymatically by either Dicer cleavage or the amplification effected in a plant cell through RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. 2 By contrast, facile reversibility of SP complex formation opens the possibility that multiple-turnover may potentiate p19's efficacy as RSS. In particular, if p19 were to disrupt the siRNA:Dicer (SD) interaction via multiple-turnover, it would potently interfere with the role of Dicer as obligatory RISC assembly factor. Consistent with such a mechanism of p19 action, we observe the efficient competition of p19 for siRNA binding with active recombinant human Dicer in the absence of other known RISC components, as well as the prominent disruption of RISC assembly complexes observed in human HeLa cell extract containing the three core RISC-loading complex components Dicer, TRBP, and Ago2. 5 Mathematical modeling demonstrates that the Dicer competition data are only accurately reproduced assuming the formation of a transient ternary complex, siRNA:Dicer:p19 (SDP). Taken together, a multiple-turnover \"catch and release\" mechanism emerges wherein p19 repeatedly promotes dissociation of SD complexes to efficiently suppress Dicer-mediated RISC assembly.",

We found that only the tetramethylrhodamine label was efficiently quenched upon p19 addition (Fig. 1b) . Addition of buffer or other proteins such as recombinant Dicer caused no such quenching ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). To observe a robust quenching signal upon p19 addition, we proceeded to label with both fluorophores together, allowing us to monitor a normalized tetramethylrhodamine:fluorescein (T/F) fluorescence ratio that is insensitive to dilution effects and other perturbations of an otherwise relative fluorescence signal. Next, we tested by EMSA p19 binding of this doubly-labeled siRNA against that of the unlabeled siRNA and detected no interference from the fluorophores (K P = 0.17 \u00b1 0.03 nM in both cases, consistent with earlier EMSA studies 15 (Fig. 1c) . Time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (trFRET) between the two fluorophores revealed only a small increase in fluorophore distance distribution upon p19 addition (with the mean distance increasing from 43.4 to 44.5 \u00c5; Fig. 1d ), indicating that formation of the SP complex leads to only a minor deformation of the siRNA duplex, as expected from X-ray crystallography. 15 We conclude that the doubly-labeled siRNA duplex is a suitable reporter for formation of the siRNA:p19 interaction in solution.",

Previous studies in embryo extracts of the fruitfly Drosophila have shown that p19 suppresses RNA silencing by competing with the Dcr2-R2D2 complex. 18, 22 To determine whether p19 also competes with human Dicer for siRNA, we employed EMSA using radio-labeled siRNA duplexes and an active recombinant human Dicer preparation, devoid of other known RISC proteins ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ) (available as a relatively crude purification of heterologously overexpressed Dicer from Genlantis, see Materials and Methods). We measured the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of the human SD complex as K D = 3.7 \u00b1 0.4 nM ( Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. S3a) . The presence of a low concentration of p19 (0.17 nM), equivalent to the K P of the SP complex, weakened this interaction by >25-fold to ~100 nM ( Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. S3b) . The presence of a saturating concentration of p19 (2.5 nM) weakened the interaction still further by >270-fold to an estimated lower limit of ~1.0 \u03bcM ( Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig.  S3c ). These findings led us to hypothesize that p19 can function to inhibit RNAi in humans by interrupting the SD complex before Dicer can hand off siRNA to RISC. Reciprocal competition experiments showed that the presence of even saturating concentrations (140 nM) of Dicer lowered the apparent affinity of p19 for siRNA only marginally (~4-fold from 0.17 \u00b1 0.03 nM to 0.81 \u00b1 0.06 nM; Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. S3d ,e), further supporting the hypothesis that strong competition with the SD complex is an important mode of action for p19 inhibition of RNAi in human cells.",

            "text": "Previous studies with Drosophila extracts have shown that p19 inhibits RISC assembly while disrupting preassembled RISC to a lesser extent. 22 Our result that p19 disrupts the complex of recombinant human Dicer with siRNA suggests that p19 may also be effective in suppressing RISC assembly in mammals. To test this hypothesis and probe p19's effect on the formation of human RISC-related complexes, we used a modified in vitro RISC assembly assay. 28, 29 Specifically, we incubated radio-labeled siRNA duplex with 15% (v/v) cytosolic HeLa cell extract, which we showed to contain the three core RISC-loading complex components Dicer, TRBP, and Ago2 (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S5), and analyzed the products by EMSA and autoradiography (Fig. 4a,b) . Three distinct siRNAcontaining complexes were observed that correspond to those previously observed, including a slowly-migrating complex D that is thought to contain Dicer, as well as two faster migrating bands termed C1 and C2 18, 30 (Fig. 4b) . The normalized fraction of complex C2 decreases over a 2-h period, whereas the complex C1 and D fractions increase (with estimated rate constants of 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 s \u22121 , 0.8 \u00d7 10 \u22123 s \u22121 , and 0.4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 s \u22121 , respectively, Fig. 4a ). To test for the presence of Dicer we performed supershift assays with anti-Dicer polyclonal antibody and found that only complex D specifically supershifts with this antibody (Fig. 4c) . Similarly, Dicer is detected by Western blot in complex D only ( Supplementary Fig. S5 ). Notably, adding increasing p19 concentrations to the cell extract prior to siRNA addition increasingly impairs the formation of all three siRNA-containing complexes, concomitant with an accumulation of the competing SP complex (Figs. 4d,e). When p19 is added to the RISC assembly assay after 2 h of pre-incubation with siRNA, the formation of particularly the Dicer-containing complex D is inhibited to a lesser extent (Figs. 4f,g). Similar results were obtained at higher HeLa cell extract concentrations and temperatures ( Supplementary Fig S4) .",

            "text": "The mechanism of competition between p19 and human Dicer can be determined from mathematically modeling the two possible modes of competition for a two-protein-singlesubstrate system. First, competition may occur through a dissociative binding mode, where the higher affinity protein shifts the relative equilibrium of the system by binding all available substrate as it dissociates from the competitor, thus establishing a new equilibrium position (Fig. 3c ). In the case of p19 and Dicer, siRNAs are pre-associated with Dicer at the onset, due to their cleavage from longer RNAs, making such dissociative binding by p19 relatively fast only if spontaneous dissociation from Dicer is rapid. Second, competition may occur through formation of a ternary complex intermediate involving siRNA, Dicer, and p19 ( Fig. 3c ). Using the previously determined gel-based apparent dissociation equilibrium constants for p19 (K P = 0.17 \u00b1 0.02 nM) and Dicer (K D = 3.7 \u00b1 0.4 nM), we can discriminate between these two possible modes of competition by calculating the resulting expected siRNA:Dicer and siRNA:p19 complex fractions and comparing them to experiments for a given set of equilibrium conditions. 31 Assumption of the dissociative binding mechanism shows poor correlation with experiment, as evident from the facts that changes upon adding Dicer are consistently overestimated (Fig. 3a) , while changes upon adding p19 are consistently underestimated (Fig. 3b ). This poor correlation suggests that ternary complex formation is needed to explain the observed efficient disruption of the siRNA:Dicer complex in the presence of p19. The inclusion of ternary complex formation into the mechanism creates a thermodynamic cycle that requires the ratio of K D /K SP to equal that of K P /K SD . 32 Rearranging and using the values of K D and K P we find that K SP /K SD = K D /K P = 21.6 and, therefore, K SP = 21.6 K SD . This result suggests that the dissociation of the ternary complex into the binary siRNA:p19 complex is >20-fold more likely than dissociation into the siRNA:Dicer complex, indicating that siRNAs can indeed be effectively shuttled toward the p19 bound state by assuming transient formation of a ternary siRNA:Dicer:p19 complex. The resulting model correlates well with experiment and explains both the weak effect that Dicer addition has on the siRNA:p19 complex and the large effect that p19 addition has on the siRNA:Dicer complex (Figs. 3a,b). A similar result is observed when p19 is placed in the context of the RNAi pathway, as follows.",

            "text": "The small, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of tombusviruses encodes p19, an RSS thought critical for symptom spread and cytotoxicity of this class of plant pathogens 20, 21, 35, 36 through its ability to bind and thus sequester Dicer-generated siRNAs. 14, 18 The proposed use of p19 in therapeutic and research applications including mammalian gene therapy, 37 vaccine production, 38, 39 and as a human retroviral protein homolog 40 motivates the study of p19 outside its natural host environment, across kingdom boundaries. We here have investigated binding of a generic siRNA by CIRV p19 through fluorescence quenching assays in combination with radioactive EMSAs. Noticeable dissociation of an siRNA from p19 (k off = 0.062 \u00b1 0.002 s \u22121 ) is counterbalanced by fast association to yield a solution based dissociation equilibrium constant (K D = 0.37 \u00b1 0.08 nM; Fig. 2 ), within 2.2fold of the high affinity previously deduced in EMSAs. 15 The dissociation of siRNA from p19 is nearly three orders-of-magnitude faster than that observed for many high-affinity nucleic acid-protein complexes with dissociation rate constants on the order of 10 \u22124 s \u22121 . 24, 25, 41, 42 Strikingly, the rate and equilibrium constants for the siRNA:p19 complex resemble those of HIV-1 protein Rev for interaction with Rev Response Element (RRE) RNA (k on = 5.3 \u00d710 8 M \u22121 s \u22121 , k off = 0.14 s \u22121 ), perhaps due to the similarly (primarily) nonsequence specific binding of a small protein to a (partially) base paired RNA duplex. 43 The presence of even low concentrations of p19 dramatically weakens the interaction of recombinant human Dicer with its siRNA product (25-to >270-fold, depending on the p19 concentration, Fig. 3a) , in the absence of other detectable RISC components. Conversely, the presence of saturating concentrations of Dicer only slightly lowers (~4-fold) the affinity of p19 for siRNA (Fig. 3b) , supporting the hypothesis that strong competition with the SD complex is an important mode of p19 action in vivo. Accordingly, assembly assays show that p19 also strongly disrupts RISC-related human siRNA-protein complexes observed in HeLa cell extract that we show to contain all core RISC-loading complex components (Dicer, Ago2, and TRBP; 5 Supplementary Fig. S1d,e) , suggesting that p19 is able to disrupt the SD complex even in the context of the full complement of RISC components (Fig. 4) . Our experimental results inform mathematical modeling of the competition between Dicer and p19 for siRNA, as well as of the steady-state interactions between siRNA, Dicer, p19, RISC, and viral (m)RNA. We determine that the minimal model necessary to achieve the experimentally observed level of competition of p19 with Dicer for siRNA requires the postulation of a transient ternary complex that favors dissociation into the siRNA:p19 complex and free Dicer (Fig. 3) . In addition, an expanded steady-state kinetic model predicts a significant enhancement in viral protein load when the siRNA:p19 interaction is assumed to be reversible, as observed experimentally. Our results thus invoke a multiple-turnover \"catch and release\" mechanism wherein p19, unlike the released siRNA, 6,34 is effectively recycled after successfully competing with Dicer (Fig. 5) . Notably, if the dissociation rate constant of the siRNA:p19 complex were lower and thus closer to that of a slow-release protein, p19 would be more efficient in competing with Dicer for siRNA, but also less efficient in releasing the siRNA to achieve multiple-turnover. It is tempting to speculate that evolution in this way has yielded a p19 with siRNA binding properties optimized for RNAi suppression.",

Strikingly, the estimated 2.2-fold enhancement in RNAi suppression through reversible siRNA:p19 complex formation is similar in magnitude to the typical RNAi effect that microRNAs have on the expression of cellular genes, 9, 44 suggesting that even a modest change in gene expression level as predicted here can have profound biological consequences, in our case on the likelihood of survival of a virus in its host.",

First, in gene therapeutic applications p19 will be required to be effective outside of its natural host environment, where a study of the protein's potential interaction partners so far has been lacking. Here, we observe p19 in the context of human cellular components and find evidence for ternary complex formation between p19, an siRNA and human Dicer. Our experimental data suggest that the observed efficient competition of p19 with the siRNA:Dicer complex (Fig. 3 ) and the resulting Dicercontaining RISC assembly complexes (Fig. 4) targets a particularly critical step on the path to an activated RISC. Recent 3D reconstructions from negatively-stained electron microscopy images of human Dicer complexes depict it as a fist-like shape with a central flat surface that is thought to bind the siRNA. 4, 45, 46 This architecture along with the known binding mode of p19 raises the possibility that p19 could bind the opposite face of the siRNA in a ternary complex with Dicer. Notably, crystal structures of several other viral suppressors also appear to bind only one face of the siRNA, leaving the opposite face open to potentially accommodate proteins such as Dicer. 47 While we did not observe formation of a super-shifted band as indicative of such a ternary complex in our EMSAs with siRNA, p19, and human Dicer (Figs. 4d-g) , the complex may simply be too short-lived or our EMSA too low in resolution for the complex to be detected.",

            "text": "Second, the previously proposed simple sequestration model would require stoichiometric p19 concentrations relative to all siRNA duplexes, native to CIRV or not, that are generated by Dicer, as well as all other small duplex RNAs bound by p19, including defective interfering RNAs, 20 the siRNA amplification products generated in plant and other cells by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity, 2,48 and perhaps miRNA duplexes. 19, 49, 50 We independently confirmed the ability of p19 to bind a human miRNA using the conserved, ubiquitous, and well-studied let-7a miRNA, which has been implicated as a tumor suppressant. 51 Remarkably, we observed that p19 binds the partially mismatched, doublestranded 22-nucleotide let-7a miRNA and our 21-nucleotide siRNA with equal affinities of 0.16 \u00b1 0.02 nM and 0.17 \u00b1 0.03 nM, respectively ( Supplementary Fig. S8 ). Similar to our observations, a recent study used an affinity-capture approach to show that p19 from CIRV retains high affinity for let-7 miRNA, as well as a fluorophore labeled siRNA. 50 These observations further underscore that p19 may face a large background of competitor RNAs while targeting its siRNA substrate, although the specific base pairing patterns of some plant miRNAs may disfavor their binding to p19. 52 Our finding that formation of the high-affinity siRNA:p19 complex is readily reversible (Fig. 2 ) while still interfering with siRNA binding by Dicer and RISC-related assembly complexes in vitro (Figs. 3 and 4) raises the possibility that sub-stoichiometric p19 concentrations may suffice in vivo to prevent siRNAs by multiple-turnover from assembling into RISC. In this fashion, the virus could keep pace with the amplified host response during systemic RNAi self-defense of the plant host against CIRV. 53 Third, while our results have an immediate impact on our understanding of the physicochemical properties and biological function of p19, a more practical consideration also arises from our work. The future of RNAi based strategies may well be dependent on the ability to control and predict the relative intracellular expression levels of RISC components and potential therapeutics. 37,54 Short hairpin RNAs (shRNA), for example, while shown in vivo to efficiently induce gene silencing, in long-term investigations have been found to cause dose-dependent liver injury and ultimately death in adult mice when sustained at high levels, 54 and to cause dysregulation of microRNAs and increased tumorigenesis when marginally dosed. 55 Co-expression with p19 could help ameliorate such toxic effects of shRNAs. In addition, CIRV p19 and other RSS's have been shown to aid in the transfection and difficult over-expression of alpha-, adeno-, and lentiviruses used in gene therapy and in plant based vaccines, through their ability to suppress the intracellular RNAi immune response. 37 For such immunosuppression to be effective, dosing of the RSS is important, analogous to the use of immunosuppressants after organ transplant surgery. In fact, our observation that at least some miRNAs tightly bind to p19 cautions that adverse developmental effects due to a sequestration of essential cellular RNAs has to be carefully avoided. Understanding and modeling relevant biophysical properties of RNAi processes in the presence of RSSs, as advanced here, is thus anticipated to become critical for a broader and safer use of RNAi therapeutics in human disease control.",

S100 cytosolic HeLa cell extract was obtained from Jena Biosciences and the integrity of Dicer in both samples was tested by Western blot analysis ( Supplementary Fig. S1a) . Additionally, we demonstrated biological activity of the recombinant Dicer through cleavage assays using long double-stranded RNA substrates ( Supplementary Fig. S1b ). An estimate of Dicer concentration in the partially purified preparation was derived from Bradford assays to measure the total protein concentration in combination with the 5% purity quoted by Genlantis and verified by Coomassie staining of a denaturing SDS-PAGE gel (Supplementary Fig. S1c ). This estimate is conservative as higher relative purities would only imply that even higher concentrations of Dicer are needed to efficiently compete with p19 for siRNA binding. All RNAs were synthesized by the HHMI Biopolymer/Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at the Yale University School of Medicine, then deprotected and purified as previously described. 27, 56 siRNA sequences were derived from the firefly luciferase gene 26 and were as follows: Sense strand 5\u2032-P-CGU ACG CGG AAU ACU UCG AAA-3\u2032; antisense strand 5\u2032-P-UCG AAG (Fluorescein-dT)AU UCC GCG (Amino C6-dT)AC GUG-3\u2032, where P denotes a 5\u2032phosphate, and Fluorescein-dT and Amino C6-dT denote the phosphoramidites of the same name from Glen Research; the antisense strand was also synthesized with only one or no modification wherein U replaced the modified dT.

Changes in free p19 protein over time depend on terms representing the natural rates of production (r x r t / r dm ), degradation (r dp [p19]), the extent of siRNA binding (k on [siRNA] [P]), and the siRNA:p19 complex dissociation (k off [SP] ). Production of p19 is governed by its transcription rate (rx), its messenger RNA degradation rate (r dm ), and its translation rate (r t ), which are assumed to have reached equilibrium on a timescale faster than that of repression. The p19 protein is degraded by the first-order rate constant (r dp ), leading to: [1] The amount of usable siRNA in the system, i.e., the fraction able to associate with RISC, is reduced by the amount of siRNA bound to p19. Production of siRNA is dependent on the catalytic rate constant of Dicer (k catD ), and siRNA is degraded with a first order rate constant (r ds ). The parameter n is the fraction of siRNA that reenters the RNAi pathway after p19 dissociation, yielding: [2] The time evolution of the viral protein of interest that serves as a reporter of RNAi suppression and p19 enhancement is described as: [3] where (k catR ) is the catalytic rate constant for RISC-mediated cleavage of mRNA. The additional term in the denominator of Equation 3 is a quasi-steady state assumption used in previous work 33, 60 to describe RISC mediated degradation of viral messenger RNA (mRNA). It assumes that the active concentration of siRNA-loaded RISC is approaching its steady-state value with rate constant k catR . This buildup of siRNA-loaded RISC contributes to the rate of degradation of the viral mRNA, as described by the concentrations of RISC and siRNA, as well as the dissociation constant K DR . The proteins not silenced by RNAi are represented at steady-state by unitless constants: [4] [5]",

Substituting Equation 6 into Equation 7 yields two solutions for S, where we choose S 2 as the more biologically relevant one: [9] Substituting S 2 into Equation 8 yields: [10] If p19 binding is assumed to be irreversible (i.e., k off = 0), then V solves to: [11] In the absence of p19 (i.e., P = 0), based on Equations 7 and 8, V reduces to the fully suppressed protein level: [12] The enhancement of viral protein production due to either irreversible (\u03c6 Irr ) or reversible p19 binding (\u03c6 Rev ) is then found to be (see also Fig. 5b ): [13] [14]",

(a) Schematic of our expanded \"catch and release\" mathematical model. A, y, and v describe the efficiencies of Dicer, RNAi in the cell, and p19, respectively. n is the fraction of siRNAs that successfully reenters the RNAi pathway after release from p19. The mature human RISC (with single stranded siRNA bound) may or may not contain Dicer (dashed outline). (b) Enhancement of viral protein load over unsuppressed protein level, assuming reversible and irreversible p19 binding (\u03c6 Rev and \u03c6 Irr , respectively). The fraction of siRNA:p19 complex over free p19, a, will increase as the efficiency of p19 (v) increases. The enhancement in the level of viral protein due to reversible p19 binding will therefore fall within the range (grey area) determined for a ranging from 0.1 (upper bound) to 200 (lower bound). ",
