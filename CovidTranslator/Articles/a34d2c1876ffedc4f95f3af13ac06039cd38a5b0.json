Collecting detailed epidemiological information from a closed population such as the quarantined Diamond Princess can produce a more comprehensive description of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases and their subsequent outcomes. Using data from the Diamond Princess, and adjusting for delay from confirmation-to-outcome and agestructure of the ship's occupants, we estimated the IFR and CFR for the outbreak in China. As of 3rd March 2020, there have been 92,809 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with 3,164 deaths [1] . On 1st February 2020, a patient tested positive for COVID-19 in Hong Kong; they disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship on the 25th January [2, 3] . This patient had onset of symptoms on the 19th January, one day before boarding the ship [2] . Upon returning to Yokohama, Japan, on February 3rd, the ship was held in quarantine, during which testing was performed in order to measure COVID-19 infections among the 3,711 passengers and crew members onboard. Passengers were initially to be held in quarantine for 14 days. However, those that had intense exposure to the confirmed case-patient, such as sharing a cabin, were held in quarantine beyond the initial 14-day window [3] . By 20 th February, there were 634 confirmed cases onboard (17%), with 328 of these asymptomatic (asymptomatic cases were either self-assessed or tested positive before symptom onset) [3] . Overall 3,063 PCR tests were performed among passengers and crew members. Testing started among the elderly passengers, descending by age [3] .

We can therefore estimate the true denominator for the CFR (i.e. the number of cases with known outcomes) by accounting for the delay from confirmation-to-death [5] . We assumed the delay from confirmation-to-death followed the same distribution as estimated hospitalisation-to-death, based on data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, between the 17 th December 2019 and the 22 th January 2020, accounting right-censoring in the data as a result of as-yet-unknown disease outcomes ( Figure 1 , panels A and B) [6] . As a sensitivity analysis, we also consider raw \"non-truncated\" distributions, which do not account for censoring; the raw and truncated distributions have a mean of 8.6 days and 13 days respectively. To correct the CFR, we use the case and death incidence data to estimate the number of cases with known outcomes [5] :",

As our corrected cCFR for Diamond Princess was 2.3% (0.75% -5.3%), this suggests we need to multiply the nCFR estimates in China [7] by a factor 46% (95% CI: 15-105%) to obtain the correct value. As the raw overall nCFR reported in the China data was 2.3% [7] , this suggests the cCFR in China during that period was 1.1% (95% CI: 0.3-2.4%) and the IFR was 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2-1.2%).

Deaths only occurred in individuals 70 years or older, so we were not able to generate age-specific cCFRs; the fatality risk may also be influenced by differences in healthcare between countries.
