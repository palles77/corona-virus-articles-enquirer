However, nucleocapsid (N) protein of two arteriviruses, porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus and equine arteritis virus, has been observed to localize in the nucleus and nucleolus of virus-infected and N-gene-transfected cells in addition to their normal cytoplasmic distribution. In the present study, the N protein of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice was examined for nuclear localization. The subcellular localization of LDV-N was determined by tagging N with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) at the N-and C-terminus. Both N-EGFP and EGFP-N fusion proteins localized to the nucleus and nucleolus of gene-transfected cells. Labeled N also accumulated in the perinuclear region, the site of virus replication. The LDV-N sequence contains a putative 'pat4'-type nuclear localization signal (NLS) consisting of 38-KKKK. To determine its functional significance, a series of deletion constructs of N were generated and individually expressed in cells. The results showed that the 'pat4' NLS was essential for nuclear translocation. In addition, the LDV-N interacted with the importin-a and -b proteins, suggesting that the LDV-N nuclear localization may occur via the importin-mediated nuclear transport pathway. These results provide further evidence for the nuclear localization of N as a common feature within the arteriviruses.",

LDV shows limited in vitro replication, which is restricted to specific murine primary macrophages and presents a low level of virus production in culture [2, 3, 20, 33] . LDV is an RNA virus with a diameter of 62-80 nm that belongs to the family Arteriviridae, a family of viruses whose members contain a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome and which includes three other member viruses: porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), equine arteritis virus (EAV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) [31] . The family Arteriviridae is grouped in the order Nidovirales along with the family Coronaviridae. Arteriviruses infect macrophages in the host animal and are responsible for a number of important diseases such as abortion and respiratory disorders in pigs by PRRSV, persistent viremia in mice by LDV, abortion and arteritis in horses by EAV, and hemorrhagic fever in monkeys by SHFV [15, 18, 32] .",

However, the N protein of PRRSV, EAV and the coronaviruses avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) localize to the nucleolus [25, 35, 40] . An interesting exception is the N protein of SARS-CoV. One study showed that SARS-CoV N protein is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm [28] , while other studies have reported that the SARS-CoV N protein is present in the both the cytoplasm and the nucleus/nucleolus [43, 44] . These findings suggest that localization of N to the nucleolus may not be a general property for all nidovirus N proteins. Once in the nucleus, the PRRSV and IBV N proteins interact with fibrillarin and nucleolin and may be involved in the cell cycle regulation [5, 40, 42] . For nuclear proteins, trafficking between the cytoplasm and the nucleus occurs through the nuclear pore complexes (NPC). While small molecules enter the nucleus by diffusion through NPC, large molecules enter the nucleus by an energy-dependent pathway using a nuclear localization signal (NLS) [8] . The NLS on the cargo protein interacts with importin proteins in the cytoplasm, which are then shuttled across the NPC and into the nucleus. Three types of NLSs have been identified. A ''pat4''-type NLS is a stretch of four basic amino acids such as 'KKKK'. A second type is ''pat7'', which is a string of amino acids starting with proline (P) followed by any other two amino acids, followed by four amino acids of which at least three are basic residues. The third type is a bipartite form. The bipartite NLS has two areas of basic residues separated by 10-12 amino acids. The first group of basic residues includes two basic amino acids, and the second group contains five amino acids, consisting of at least three basic residues [16, 26] . In this report, we examined the N protein nuclear localization of LDV and identified a functional 'pat-4' signal sequence essential for N protein translocation into the nucleus.",

The data showed that two 'K's at positions 38 and 40 are important for nucleolar localization of LDV N, and the residues at positions 38, 40, and 41 play a crucial role for this function (Table 2; Fig. 4 ). The mutant in which all four 'K's were substituted with 'G's became exclusively cytoplasmic and did not localize to the nucleus or the nucleolus (Fig. 5a) . This confirms that the predicted 'pat-4' motif was indeed the functional NLS for nuclear localization of the LDV-N protein. Since LDV is a murine virus and HeLa cells were used for this study, the NLS function of LDV-N was further confirmed in mouse cells using the same constructs (Fig. 5b) . NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with either wild-type or NLS-null mutant LDV-N and their fluorescence patterns were examined. As expected, the PRRSV N protein was found in the nucleus and nucleolus in the murine cells. For LDV-N, the nucleolar localization was evident for the wild-type N protein, whereas the NLSnull mutant protein was cytoplasmic without distinct nuclear staining, indicating that the LDV-N nuclear localization is not cell-type-dependent but is rather a natural property of the N protein.

Nidoviruses also replicate exclusively in the cytoplasm of infected cells [1] , but the N protein has been shown to localize in the nucleus and nucleolus for PRRSV, EAV, IBV, MHV and TGEV [6, 10, 25, 35, 40, 45] . The N protein of PRRSV contains two putative NLS motifs, 'pat 4' and 'pat 7', and the ''pat 7'' located at positions [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] has been shown to be the active and primary NLS for N [27] . In the present study, we showed that the LDV-N protein localized to the nucleus and nucleolus in cells transfected with the N-EGFP gene, and using mutant constructs, we showed that the nuclear localization of N was dependent on a 'pat-4' motif located at positions 38-41 (Figs. 2a, 3) . The location of the 'pat-4' motif in LDV-N is similar to the region where the functional 'pat 7' motif is located in PRRSV N. We further identified two lysine residues at positions 38 and 40 in LDV-N that form core residues for nuclear transport of N. For PRRSV N, amino acids at positions 43 and 44 are critical residues for nuclear localization [14, 21, 27] . For a protein to localize in the nucleus, the cellular chaperone importin-a recognizes the NLS on the cargo protein, and subsequently, importin-b binds to the importin-a/cargo protein complex, transporting the complex in the presence of Ran-GDP to NPC on the nuclear membrane [8, 17] . We found that LDV-N binds to importin-a (Fig. 6, lane 8) , which is consistent with the utilization of the classical pathway for nuclear transport. It is interesting to note that LDV-N also binds to importin-b (Fig. 6, lane 10) . PRRSV N also binds to both importin-a and importin-b [27] , and several other viral proteins have been reported to interact with both importin-a and -b. The polyomavirus capsid protein requires interaction with both importin-a and -b to enter the nucleus [23] , and SV40 VP3 also interacts with both importin proteins for nuclear translocation [17] . The HIV Rev protein binds both importin-a and -b, but its binding to importin-a is NLS-independent, while importinb binding is NLS-dependent [9] . For PRRSV, two nucleolar proteins, nucleolin and B23, have been shown to bind to N (unpublished data), and thus a possible mechanism for LDV-N nuclear transport is the use of an importin-dependent pathway with a 'piggy-backing' mechanism, in which N binds to a nuclear-targeted cellular protein in addition to importin proteins.",

            "text": "Since N proteins of PRRSV, EAV, and LDV all localize to the nucleus and nucleolus, the nuclear role of N during infection is of major interest. The core protein of hepatitis C virus is believed to modify cellular function by preventing translocation of host cell proteins to the nucleus [12, 34] , and the N protein of TGEV has been suggested to play a role in the disruption of cell division [40] . For PRRSV N, disruption of NLS does not affect virus replication in cell culture, but in pigs, NLS-null viruses are attenuated in their virulence [14, 21] . The NLS motif of PRRSV N was associated with strong selective pressure for reacquisition of the nuclear function in vivo, suggesting the involvement of N nuclear localization in viral pathogenesis. N proteins of several member viruses in the order Nidovirales colocalize and interact with fibrillarin and nucleolin in the nucleolus, supporting the hypothesis that N modulates host-cell ribosomal biogenesis and cell cycle progression [5, 11] . In summary, we show that LDV-N contains a functional 'pat-4'-type NLS at positions 38-41 and localizes in the nucleolus of cell via the importin-mediated pathway. The nuclear localization of the capsid protein may be a common feature of members of the family Arteriviridae and may play a common role for replication and pathogenesis of this group of viruses. ",

Cells on the coverslips were visualized by fluorescence microscopy (model AX70, Olympus). a HeLa cells without transfection; b HeLa cells with the pEGFP-N1 empty vector; c PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells stained with the N-specific MAb SDOW-17; d PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells stained with bovine coronavirus spike-protein-specific MAb; e HeLa cells with PRRSV-N gene stained with SDOW-17; f HeLa cells with PRRSV-N-GFP; g HeLa cells with LDV-N-EGFP; h HeLa cells with EGFP-LDV-a and importin-b genes were cloned into pGEX-3X (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) and expressed as glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-importin-a and GST-importin-b fusion proteins. One ml of Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 lg/ml of ampicillin was inoculated with 1/100 of an overnight culture. When the optical density of the culture reached 0.6 at 600 nm, IPTG (isopropyl-b-Dthiogalactopyranoside) was added to a final concentration of 1 mM, and the culture was incubated further for 3 h. Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 10 min 4\u00b0C (Avanti J30I, Beckman) and resuspended in 10 ml of PBS. The bacterial suspension was sonicated on ice three times (model W-385; Ultrasonics Inc.), each time for 30 s with 2-s intervals. The suspension was incubated with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4\u00b0C with occasional agitation and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to remove the insoluble fractions and cell debris.
