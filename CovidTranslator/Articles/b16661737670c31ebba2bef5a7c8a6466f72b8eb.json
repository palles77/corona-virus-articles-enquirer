For more than 60 years a highly effective live attenuated vaccine has been available, its widespread use resulting in a dramatic decrease in the number of cases. On rare occasions, YF vaccine can cause mild to severe disease and rare adverse vaccine-associated events have been reported. Additionally, an average viremia of 3-5 days after administration of the YF vaccine has been published. Here we present a case where YF vaccine was isolated in cell culture from a respiratory swab collected from a patient presenting with influenza-like illness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report finding replicating YF vaccine in the respiratory sample of a post inoculated individual.",

The use of culture to detect respiratory pathogens became increasingly common in clinical virology laboratories during the last 50 years with the commercial availability of cell cultures. However, with the introduction of commercially manufactured and FDA-approved molecular assays, including multiplexed PCR assays, the preference for testing viral pathogens using cell culture systems is diminishing [2] . In this case study we describe the utility of cell culture followed by electron microscopy (EM) to identify an unknown pathogen causing ILI in a healthy 19 year old woman.
