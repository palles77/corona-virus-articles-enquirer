            "text": "The discovery of a novel coronavirus (CoV) as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has highlighted the need for a better understanding of CoV replication. The replication of SARS-CoV is highly dependent on host cell factors. However, relatively little is known about the cellular proteome changes that occur during SARS-CoV replication. Recently, we developed a cell line expressing a SARS-CoV subgenomic replicon and used it to screen inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication. To identify host proteins important for SARS-CoV RNA replication, the protein profiles of the SARS-CoV replicon cells and parental BHK21 cells were compared using a quantitative proteomic strategy termed \"stable-isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture-mass spectrometry\" (SILAC-MS). Our results revealed that, among the 1,081 host proteins quantified in both forward and reverse SILAC measurements, 74 had significantly altered levels of expression. Of these, significantly upregulated BCL2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) was selected for further functional studies. BAG3 is involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, including cell survival, cellular stress response, proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Our results show that inhibition of BAG3 expression by RNA interference led to significant suppression of SARS-CoV replication, suggesting the possibility that upregulation of BAG3 may be part of the machinery that SARS-CoV relies on for replication. By correlating the proteomic data with these functional studies, the findings of this study provide important information for understanding SARS-CoV replication.",

Virus-host interactions are crucial determinants of virus host range, replication, and pathology. Studies of virus-host interactions have advanced understanding of viral and cellular function and can provide targets for antiviral development. One area in which the importance of host factors is increasingly emerging is the replication of positive-strand RNA [(\u03e9) RNA] viruses. (\u03e9) RNA viruses are the largest genetic class of viruses and include significant human pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), hepatitis C virus, and West Nile virus. Defining the host factors that govern the replication of (\u03e9) RNA viruses will enhance our general understanding of their molecular biology and may have important implications for the development of novel antiviral control strategies. Whereas recent studies show that host factors are critical for (\u03e9) RNA virus genome replication and mRNA synthesis and are targeted by (\u03e9) RNA viruses to modulate host gene expression and defenses (1, 33) , identifying such factors remains difficult.",

The SARS-CoV genome encompasses 29,727 nucleotides, and the genome organization is similar to that of other coronaviruses. The genome is predicted to contain 14 functional open reading frames (ORFs) (41, 60) . SARS-CoV genome translation yields two large replicase polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) that are autoproteolytically cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1 to -16) by proteases residing in nsp3 and nsp5 (21, 23, 53) . These 16 SARS-CoV nsps include RNA-binding protein (nsp9), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), helicase (nsp13), RNA synthesis proteins (nsp8 and nsp14), and several transmembrane proteins (nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6), etc. (69) . They are the primary constituents of the replication/transcription complex (RTC), which is believed to be associated with characteristic double membrane vesicles (DMVs) derived from modified host cell membranes (57, 62) . RNA replication is believed to occur on DMVs and uses host proteins as part of their replication strategies (57) . Thus, identifying such host factors and their contributions has long been recognized as an important frontier.",

            "text": "Recent advances in molecular profiling technologies have allowed for advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of cellular responses to the SARS-CoV infection. Analysis of gene expression profiles during viral infection is one of the powerful approaches to probe potential cellular genes involved in viral infection and pathogenesis (37, 59) , but ultimately protein expression and posttranslational modification (PTM) determine virus replication. Thus, the molecular analysis of viral infection would greatly benefit from a proteomics approach that combines the advantages of high-throughput analysis and the focus on protein levels and modifications. Proteomic techniques as a powerful research tool have recently become available for large-scale protein analysis, and stableisotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) is one of the most effective methods for the simultaneous detection of diverse changes in protein expression (49) . With SILAC, the entire proteome of a given cell population is metabolically labeled by heavy, nonradioactive isotopic variants of amino acids, thus making it distinguishable by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Thereafter, two or more distinctly SILAClabeled cell populations can be mixed and analyzed in one MS experiment, which allows accurate quantitation of proteins from the different cellular states (49) . Because of its properties of being simple, inexpensive, and accurate, SILAC is being used in the life sciences more and more extensively (4, 9, 30, 58) . To date, a small but increasing number of studies have used proteomics approaches to investigate various aspects concerning the infection and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV and the virus-host interactions (24, 67) . In spite of these data, it is important to establish a comprehensive catalogue of the cellular factors interacting with the virus RNA that may regulate the SARS-CoV replication.",

The workflow in this study is outlined in Fig. 1 . To obtain reliable results, we carried out both forward and reverse SILAC experiments. After cell lysis, SDS-PAGE fractionation, in-gel digestion, LC-MS/MS analysis, and the database search, we were able to identify 1,801 proteins, among which 1,480 could be quantified.

Together, this gives quantifiable results for 1,081 proteins (data not shown). Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were selected based on a predefined threshold of 2.0-fold change (the ratio of BHK21 to SCR-1 expression was greater than 2.0 or less than 0.5). Among the quantified proteins, 43 were upregulated and 31 were downregulated in SCR-1 cells. The quantification results for the proteins with significant changes are summarized in Table 1 . (Detailed information about the quantified proteins and ratios for each experiments was obtained [data not shown].) Functional categories of DEPs. In order to understand the biological relevance of the changes in protein expression in response to SARS-CoV replication, PANTHER classification system was used to classify the 74 DEPs according to their functions. The PANTHER classification system revealed that the DEPs can be classified into 23 groups according to their functional properties (Fig. 2) . These proteins are implicated in a broad range of cellular activities (Fig. 2) . Proteins involved in nucleic acid binding account for the largest portion (27%). There are also a significant number of proteins involved in regulatory molecule (13%), chaperone (10%), and kinase (9%) activities. Among these DEPs, of particular interest are upregulated chaperones and downregulated host translational machinery. We expect that these host factors play important roles in SARS-CoV replication.

The apoptosis and cell growth assay revealed that reduction of BAG3 had no significant influence on Vero cell growth or apoptosis (data not shown). The resulting cell lines were tested for the ability of SARS-CoV to replicate using real-time PCR and plaque reduction assay. Reduction of BAG3 levels resulted in a significant decrease in SARS-CoV RNA and virus titer compared to the parental Vero E6 and Vero-NC cells (Fig. 5B and C) . To evaluate BAG3's specificity for SARS-CoV replication, we asked if growth of another coronavirus, IBV, was altered in the Vero-KD cells. In contrast to SARS-CoV, plaquing efficiency of IBV was unaffected by decreased BAG3 levels (Fig. 5C ). Thus, our data indicate that BAG3 is a host protein that is specifically required for efficient replication of SARS-CoV and not IBV.",

Increasing evidence emphasizes comparative proteomics to screen the differentially expressed proteins associated with host cellular pathophysiological processes of virus infection (42, 54, 63) . From the literature, very few studies have been performed to analyze the interaction between CoV and host cells using proteomics analysis. This study is the first to employ the SILAC technique to globally search for the dysregulated host proteins in SARS-CoV replicon cells. In the present work, a total of 74 differentially expressed host proteins were identified and differential expression levels of nine DEPs were confirmed by Western blotting and densitometric analysis. The PANTHER classification system revealed that the proteins can be classified into 23 groups according to their biological process or molecular functions (Fig. 2) . Based on the identified proteins in the present work, we obtained an overview of the altered protein expression of host cells responding to SARS-CoV replication.",

            "text": "By comparison with the previous genomic study that analyzed the SARS-CoV-infected cells using mRNA microarray approaches (37), among 74 proteins identified in the current study, 14 of them were also found to be altered at the mRNA level, namely, Rps10, Rps19, Laptm4a, Rac1, Ctsl, Rpl27a, Myst2, Rpl36, Rps18, Trit1, Ppp1r10, Rpl18, Hspa1a, and Clasp1. Most of the remaining identified proteins are newly discovered. The limited overlap between two studies is expected to reflect, at least in part, the different effects between viral infection and replicon RNA on the host cell. In addition, the poor correlation between proteomic and genomic results was not unexpected, as previous studies showed that there exists an approximately 60 to 80% discordance between mRNA and protein abundances (47, 64) . This lack of correlations could be the result of mRNA degradation, alternative splicing, and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. Therefore, the current proteomic study represents a complementary strategy for studies of mechanisms that underlie the replication of SARS-CoV. Among all DEPs, significantly upregulated BAG3, a member of the BAG cochaperone protein family, was selected for further functional studies. Our results demonstrate that BAG3 knockdown results in greatly diminished virus replication, suggesting the possibility that upregulation of BAG3 may be part of the machinery that SARS-CoV relies on for replication. However, the mechanisms by which BAG3 regulates SARS-CoV replication remain unknown. BAG proteins participate in a wide variety of cellular processes, including cell survival, cellular stress response, proliferation, migration, and apoptosis (14, 25) . BAG3 is implicated in the pathogenesis of neoplasia via its ability to regulate stress-induced apoptosis in a prosurvival fashion. This regulation occurs at a number of levels, including cytochrome c release, apoptosome assembly, and others (5, 55) . Other cellular signaling molecules that have been reported to be regulated by BAG3 include Raf-1, cyclindependent kinase 4 (CDK-4), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (13) , as well as focal adhesion kinase (27) . Notably, there is increasing evidence that BAG3 is required for efficient growth of different viruses, including varicella-zoster virus (VZV) (35) , polyomavirus JC (3), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (66), herpes simplex virus (HSV) (36) , and HIV (56) and depletion of BAG3 by small interfering RNA results in inhibition of virus replication (35) . Recent evidence implicates an additional function of BAG3 in the regulation of the autophagy pathway. These findings indicate that autophagosome formation and turnover may depend on BAG3 and BAG3 can stimulate autophagy processes (7, 8, 18) . Autophagy is a cellular stress response that functions to recycle proteins and organelles and an intracellular catabolic transport route conserved among all eukaryotic cells (22, 65) . One of its functions is to act as an immune mechanism against intracellular pathogens (38, 50) . Bacteria and viruses targeted for destruction are sequestered into large doublemembrane vesicles (DMV) called autophagosomes and subsequently delivered to the lysosomes, where they are degraded by hydrolases. However, it has become clear that the autophagy pathway is often exploited by viruses to facilitate their entry or replication (29, 32) . Importantly, the laboratory of Mark Denison has shown that the DMVs induced by infection with SARS-CoV and the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) could be autophagosomes, while MHV infection appears to induce autophagy and inhibition of autophagy leads to suppression of MHV growth (52, 53, 68) . Their results demonstrate that the autophagy pathway is required for formation of a viral replication complex and for efficient viral growth. The significant conservation of replicase gene organization and probable functions of SARS-CoV and MHV replicase proteins further suggest that SARS-CoV may share with MHV the strategy of induction and use of the autophagy pathway for efficient replication (53) .",

The 14-3-3 proteins have emerged as critical regulators of diverse cellular responses in eukaryotic organisms (2, 17, 46) . In mammalian cells, seven different isoforms have been identified (, \u2424, \u2425, \u03b5, , , and ), with each isoform having distinct tissue localization and function. Through interactions with more than 400 target proteins identified so far, these 14-3-3 proteins are known to be involved in widespread biological processes such as signal transduction, cell cycle control, apoptosis, cellular metabolism, proliferation, cytoskeletal regulation, transcription, redox regulation, stress response, etc. (11, 61) . Interesting evidence has been reported indicating that 14-3-3 might be important for host translational shutoff, the shutoff of minus strand synthesis, or other processes that are time dependent in virus-infected cells (12) . Recently, it was also reported that 14-3-3 proteins are involved in the activation of signaling cascades during viral infection (48) . Therefore, the increase in 14-3-3 protein expression is likely part of the cell's response to SARS-CoV replication and appears to represent a homeostatic mechanism for cell defense.",

Further studies will determine more directly how implicated host factors affect the virus and how such effects illuminate cellular functions and pathways.",
