In this study, several monoclonal antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein have been generated to examine distribution of the nucleocapsid in virus-infected cells and to study antigenic regions of the protein. Confocal microscopic analysis identified nucleocapsids packaged in vesicles in the perinuclear area indicating viral synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The monoclonal antibodies bound to the central and carboxyterminal half of the nucleocapsid protein indicating prominent exposure and immunogenicity of this part of the protein.",

Predictions of antigenicity using mathematical modelling based on hydrophobicity analysis of SARS nucleoprotein could not be confirmed fully. Antibody binding to discontinuous peptides provides evidence that amino acids 274-283 and 373-382 assemble to a structural unit particularly rich in basic amino acids. In addition, amino acids 286-295, 316-325 and 361-367 that represent the epitope recognised by monoclonal antibody 6D11C1 converge indicating a well-structured C-terminal region of the SARS virus nucleocapsid protein and functional relationship of the peptide regions involved. Alternatively, dimerisation of the nucleocapsid protein may result in juxtaposition of the amino acid sequences 316-325 and 361-367 on one nucleoprotein molecule to amino acid 286-295 on the second peptide. The monoclonal antibodies will be available to assess antigenicity and immunological variabilities between different SARS CoV strains.",

This was followed at the beginning of 2003 by worldwide spreading of the infection. The SARS-causing agent was identified as a coronavirus (CoV), probably of animal origin. The SARS outbreak was brought under control after 6 months except for a few sporadic cases diagnosed in the following months (Peiris et al., 2004) . However, since until today the source of the virus is unknown and the virus may still exist in animals, there remains the risk of a new outbreak.",

The genome of the SARS CoV comprises 29,751 nucleotides and contains 15 partly overlapping open reading frames (ORF). The ORFs 1a and 1b encode the viral transcriptase. Four other ORFs are assigned to viral structural proteins, the spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid (N) protein (Marra et al., 2003) . In infected cells, the nucleocapsid protein is the most abundant of the viral proteins (He et al., 2004) . In the virion, nucleoprotein molecules associate with viral RNA forming the helical nucleocapsid (Davies et al., 1981; Nelson et al., 2000) . The protein contains both nuclear localisation and export signals (Rowland et al., 2005; Timani et al., 2005; You et al., 2005) suggesting shuttling of the protein between the nuclear and the cytoplasmic compartment in virus-infected cells. Electron microscopy, conventional immunofluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopic analyses demonstrate that the N protein is located in the cytoplasm of infected cells. In addition, in cells transfected with expression plasmids that contain the nucleoprotein gene, the N protein was observed in the nucleus (Chang et al., 2004; Ksiazek et al., 2003; You et al., 2005) . Moreover, nucleolar localisation of the SARS nucleoprotein in transfected cells was reported . However, inconsistent data were obtained with respect to the presence of the N protein in the nucleus of virus-infected cells with some studies seeing no evidence of nuclear localisation (Qinfen et al., 2004; Rowland et al., 2005; Timani et al., 2005; You et al., 2005) .",

The structure of an N-terminal portion of the nucleoprotein (amino acid residues 45-181) of the virus comprising a putative RNA-binding domain has been analysed by NMR spectroscopy. The protein fragment consists of a five-stranded antiparallel \u2424-sheet. An additional \u2424-hairpin connects \u24242 and \u24243. The \u24243-strand contains the amino acid sequence FYYL-GTGP that is conserved among all coronaviruses (Huang et al., 2004) . The structure of the central and C-terminal portions of the protein has been less well-characterized. Computer modelling by Tang et al. (2005) identified a region around amino acids 250-360 that exhibits a distinctively ordered structure. In addition, there is a lysine-rich region (amino acids 362-390) of unknown function possibly involved in RNA-binding (He et al., 2004) or nuclear localisation .",

In fact, these peptides contained two epitopes recognised by four of the mAbs in this study. However, an additional five epitope peptides recognised by the antibodies were only partially or not represented by the predicted peptides. Similarly, computer modelling by the method of Kolaskar and Tongaonkar predicted 16 antigenic peptides in the central and C-terminal part of the N protein (He et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2003) . A comparison of the peptide sequences with the epitopes identified in this study showed that none of the epitopes associated with a B-cell immune response contained any of the 16 peptides predicted in the semi-empirical model. This indicates that the specificity of the B-cell response to SARS nucleoprotein in mice is poorly amenable to predictions based on hydrophobicity analysis.",

            "text": "The structure of an N-terminal portion of the nucleoprotein (amino acid residues 45-181) of the virus has been determined by NMR spectroscopy and a putative RNA-binding domain has been identified (Huang et al., 2004) . In contrast, the structure of the central and C-terminal part of the SARS CoV nucleocapsid protein has not yet been clarified. Identification of conformational epitopes in the C-terminal area permits postulations on the protein configuration. For instance, to be accessible to the antibodies, the epitope sequences must not be covered by other parts of the molecule. Furthermore, comparison with predictions of the tertiary structure indicates that the converging amino acids 286-295, 316-325, 360-370 recognised by antibody 6D11C1 are located in or close to different helical sequences. Moreover, a major conformational epitope in this area provides experimental evidence for the highly ordered structure of the region around aa 250-360 that has been previously predicted (Tang et al., 2005) . Biochemical studies demonstrate that aa 270-370 comprise a dimerisation domain of the nucleoprotein which is analogous to a dimerisation domain in the nucleoprotein of other coronaviruses (Fan et al., 2005) . Recent crystal structure analysis of this region in both the SARS coronavirus (Yu et al., 2006) and of the structural homolog in infectious bronchitis virus (Jayaram et al., 2006) demonstrate that epitope residues aa 316-325 and 360-370 recognised by antibody 6D11C1 are in close proximity in the monomeric form of the N protein. In contrast, aa 286-295, which represent part of the antibody epitope, are distantly located. Dimerisation of the protein results in juxtaposition of aa 286-295 of one nucleoprotein molecule to aa 316-325 and 360-370 of the second peptide molecule. Thus, the epitope identified independently supports the structural analysis results reported by Jayaram et al. (2006) and Yu et al. (2006) and suggests that the monoclonal antibody 6D11C1 cross-links two nucleocapsid protein molecules. It would be interesting to examine whether cross-linkage of SARS nucleoprotein dimers by the monoclonal antibody affects infectivity of the virus.",
