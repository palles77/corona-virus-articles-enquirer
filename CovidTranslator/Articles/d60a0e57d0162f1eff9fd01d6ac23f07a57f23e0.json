New infectious diseases will always emerge and old threats can appear again. However, the concern is that climate change will accelerate this dynamic. Any such 'ramping up' of disease emergence offers a range of possible outcomes, from little overall impact to the occurrence of potentially catastrophic, collective disease events (del Rio Vilas et al., 2013) .",

Under conditions of climate change, such system 'features and forcings' are unlikely to act on a single disease. However, not all diseases will reach the threshold required for global spread. We know that climate change will decrease the threat of some diseases, while having little impact on others. It is possible that conditions, on balance, will support, rather than inhibit, collective disease events. As such, we are working from the hypothesis that climate change will nudge synergies and interactions between drivers, and between diseases themselves, forging a 'cascade effect' that may ultimately result in MEIDs. While a cascade builds energy and momentum over time, similarly climate change may forge conditions for MEIDs. If so, this raises a variety of questions. Firstly, can we identify, a priori, the cascade of factors that might alter the composition and/or frequency of occurrence of such collective disease events? Secondly, can we calculate the related risk? Finally, on a broader level, will such cascades provide warning signs of wider systems change?",

An R0 > 1 supports an epidemic, while R0 < 1 predicts that a disease will die out. In this manner, R0 is a threshold, as opposed to a scale or strength, value. For vectors and some parasites, R0 refers to 'the average number of female offspring produced throughout the lifetime of a mature female . . . which themselves achieve reproductive maturity, in the absence of density-dependent constraints' (Gumel and Lenhart, 2010). Calculations of R0 are then linked to general habitat conditions such as the normalised difference vegetative index (NDVI), surface hydrology and temperature data, the latter via remote sensing (RS) and geographical information systems (GIS) (Mas-Coma et al., 2008) . The parameters are applied to simulation models to create predictions/scenarios of a vector population and, hence, dynamics of a particular vector-borne disease under conditions of climate change.

In relation to the systems concept of a tipping point, calculations of R0, which estimate infectiousness, may be viewed as 'bifurcation' measures, where a single disease 'tips' from one state to another. However, the calculation offers little insight into the 'tipping elements' (here the 'forcings' of the system or the inter-relationship of factors driving such change). On the face of it, R0 may be a better 'outcome' than 'predictive' measure. Recently, it has been hypothesised that R0 < 1 can still be important in contributing to the conditions required for the emergence of an epidemic (Antia et al., 2013) .

As such, for vector-borne diseases, R0 may lack the characteristics required to be either a 'bifurcation' or 'outcomebased' measure of the disease or system. Clearly the aggregate of individual disease R0 values could offer at least an approximate indicator of the collective epidemic/panzootic potential in any given geographical area.
