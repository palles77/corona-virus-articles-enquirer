The protective efficacy of IgY against Stx2 was determined by in vitro and in vivo experiments. The results show that IgY was able to recognize Stx2B and Stx2 in denatured conditions, attached to a solid-phase and free in solution. The anti-Stx2B IgY could effectively block the biological activity of Stx2 on Vero cells and protect mice from Stx2 challenge. The data suggest that immunization of hens with Stx2B could be a strategy to obtain at low cost a relatively high concentration of anti-Stx2 egg yolk IgY, able to neutralize Stx2 lethal activity. IgY technology could be an useful tool for research, diagnosis and therapy of EHEC infection.",

Transmission is most frequently associated with the consumption of contaminated food or unpasteurized dairy products and infections can also be acquired through person-to person contact (Griffin, 1995) . The clinical manifestations of EHEC infections range from watery diarrhea, or hemorrhagic colitis (HC), to the most severe outcome, the life threatening hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) (Nataro and Kaper, 1998) . HUS occurs in about 5-10% of individuals, primarily very young and elderly subjects (Rivas et al., 2010) . Although EHEC infections are a serious problem in developed countries, Argentina has the highest incidence of HUS in the world, with approximately 500 new cases observed each year in children under 5 years of age (Rivas et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "STEC also referred to as verotoxin producing E. coli (VTEC), produce cytotoxins structurally related to those produced by Shigella dysenteriae type 1. Shiga toxins (Stx1 and Stx2) are the main virulence factors involved in the pathogenesis of HUS and belong to the class known as AB5 toxins composed of one A subunit and five identical B subunits. The A subunit (32 kDa), possesses enzymatic RNA N-glycosidase activity that hydrolyzes the N-glycoside bond of adenosine of the 28 S rRNA of 60 S ribosomes, and hence inhibits protein synthesis; B subunits (7 kDa) are mainly involved in receptor binding (Jeong et al., 2010) . STEC strains produce Stx1, Stx2 (or their variants), or both of these toxins. Although the mechanisms of action of Stxs are thought to be similar, cytotoxicity of Stx2 may be stronger than that of Stx1; the 50% lethal dose in mice of purified Stx2 is 1 ng, whereas Stx1 has a 50% lethal dose of 400 ng (Tesh et al., 1993) . Additionally, epidemiological data indicate that Stx2 producing strains are more frequently associated to severe illnesses such as HUS than Stx1 producing strains (Karmali et al., 1985) . Due to their extreme toxicity, Shiga toxins are classified in category B of bioterrorism agents by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2009) .",

            "text": "Immunoglobulins are widely used for a variety of purposes, such as in diagnostic tests, purification columns, and passive immunotherapy (Kim et al., 2010) . Therefore, research and diagnostic community constantly demand new alternatives and procedures to produce cost-effective antibodies. The use of laying hens to produce polyclonal antibodies is an alternative to the use of mammals, such as rabbits and, since more than two decades, egg yolk antibodies (IgY) are a low cost and ethical alternative (Schade et al., 1996; Schade and Chacana, 2007) . Compared with the stressful bleeding of mammals to obtain serum, IgY can be easily obtained non-invasively from the egg yolk. From the economical point of view, the amount of antibodies produced by a single hen is similar to that of a large mammal such as a sheep or goats, whereas maintenance costs are much lower (Schade et al., 2005; Zhang, 2003) . IgY from serum is actively transferred into the yolk by a receptor -mediated process (Schade et al., 2005) and the amount of the immunoglobulin varies between 100 and 250 mg per egg (Schade et al., 1996) . Thus, a substantial amount of antibody can be produced from just one hen (up to 40 g of total IgY per chicken per year), of which 1-10% is expected to be specific to the antigen of interest (Mine and Kovacs-Nolan, 2002) . In contrast to mammalian IgG, IgY antibodies do not activate mammalian complement, do not cross-react with Fc receptors, mammalian rheumatoid factor, or human anti-mouse antibodies, thus eliminating false-positive results in serological assays (Schade et al., 2005) . Also, chickens are able to develop a better response against mammalian antigens, due to the phylogenetic distance between mammals and birds (Schade et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "In this work, significant levels of specific antibodies were measured by ELISA after 25 days of initiating immunization, showing that Stx2B (w11 kDa) is immunogenic for chickens. However, in some other mammal species as human (Ludwig et al., 2001) and mice (Imai et al., 2004) , Stx2B was found to be a poor immunogen. Marcato et al. (2001) reported that high specific antibody titers against Stx2B in rabbits could only be achieved including endotoxin in the antigen preparation. So it can be hypothesized that a selective pressure to minimize a long-term immunity against the B subunit was favored in host species (Johannes, 2002) . Although a high antibody response was achieved at the beginning of immunization, ELISA results from chicken sera showed that levels of specific antibodies were not constantly maintained in the immunized birds, in contrast to the results of Pauly et al. (2009) . It is possible that conjugation of Stx2B with a carrier may be necessary (Marcato et al., 2005) although Wang et al. (2010) obtained a high titer of specific antibodies against B subunit from Shiga toxin type 1 without conjugation to a carrier and the response remained constant over one year. This suggests a possible negative effect of B subunit from Shiga toxin type 2 in laying hens. To the best of our knowledge, there is no information available regarding to this fact, though it has been reported that the Stx holotoxin and the B subunit have harmful effects, including lethality, in different mammal species (Huang et al., 2010) . Early studies have established that chickens tend to be more resistant against toxins than other species (Bengtson, 1924) .",

However, to obtain 4 mg of specific anti-Stx2B antibody from one hen the collection of only 5 eggs was enough, while to reach the same amount of specific IgG, the exsanguination of one rabbit was necessary. Total IgY yield per egg was 8.4 mg although Gassmann et al. (1990) described a yield of 64 mg IgY per egg. However, there was less difference in the amount of specific antibodies per egg: 0.67 mg from this work and 2 mg from Gassmann et al. (1990) . Another group (Bizhanov and Vyshniauskis, 2000) reported a recovery rate of 2-10 mg of anti-Sendai virus IgY per ml of egg yolk.",

Therefore, alternative therapeutic approaches, such as inhibiting Shiga toxin activity or absorption from the intestine, are required. Oral administration of IgY has proved successful for treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal infections, such as bovine and human rotaviruses, bovine coronavirus, Yersinia ruckeri, C. difficile, Salmonella spp., Edwardsiella tarda, Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas, (Mine and Kovacs-Nolan, 2002; Schade et al., 2005) . Chicken egg yolk has previously been used as an inexpensive and effective source of IgY antibodies for the passive immunization or treatment of piglets suffering enterotoxigenic F4(K88)\u00fe (Marquardt et al., 1999) and F18ab\u00fe (Imberechts et al., 1997) E. coli infections, dental caries due to Streptococcus mutans in humans (Smith et al., 2001) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection in piglets (Kweon et al., 2000) . Therefore, anti-Stx IgY could be an economic alternative for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of EHEC infections or Stx exposure, either alone or combined with other products. Furthermore, therapeutic use of IgY in primates was effectively studied by LeClaire et al. (2002) using neutralizing IgY antibodies against the highly toxic staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB).",

Since Stx plays a role in both colonization and systemic disease, passive administration of anti-Stx antibodies to reduce or prevent EHEC infection in people has also been proposed (Krystle et al., 2010) . This was demonstrated in mouse models with anti-Stx2 antibodies administered before infection (Donohue-Rolfe et al., 1999) . In subsequent evaluations of the efficacy of such passive therapy, anti-Stx antibodies were shown to provide protection against STEC-mediated illness and death even when administered up to 4 days after bacterial challenge (Donohue-Rolfe et al., 1999; Yamagami et al., 2001) . Besides, IgY is widely used in many applications ranging from immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, immuno-enzyme techniques (ELISA), Western blotting and immunoelectrophoresis (Lee et al., 2002; Tini et al., 2002) . These antibodies are capable to detect multiple bacterial and parasitic organisms such as Acanthamoeba spp., Helicobacter pylori (Shin et al., 2002) , microsporidia (Young et al., 2007) , E. coli O157:H7 (Sunwoo et al., 2006) .",
