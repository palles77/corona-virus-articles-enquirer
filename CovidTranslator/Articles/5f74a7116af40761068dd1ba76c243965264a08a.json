            "text": "Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is a positive strand RNA virus ubiquitous in multi-cat environments such as breeding catteries, rescue shelters, cat sanctuaries and large cats in zoos, but rare in stray and feral cats. ( FCoV is primarily a pathogen of the gastrointestinal tract of domestic cats, replicating in the intestines and is spread by faecal-oral transmission from cats that are either persistently or transiently infected (Addie et al, 2001 ; Addie et al, 2003) . FCoV infections are often subclinical, but may result in a number of problematic conditions such as acute and chronic diarrhoea, stunting of kittens or transient upper respiratory signs in newly infected kittens and cats, and faecal incontinence in persistently infected carrier cats (Addie and Jarrett, 1992; Kipar et al., 1998) . FCoV RNA was found in five of 14 cats with chronic caecocolic disease , although it was unclear if FCoV was the cause of the lesions (Hahn et al, 2017) . Some cats that acquire the infection, typically 7-14% (Addie et al., 1995) develop feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), until recently considered to be an almost uniformly fatal disease. However, in a major advance, Pedersen et al. (2019) found recently that FIP can be cured by the parenteral administration of GS-441524, a novel antiviral nucleoside analogue. While this drug has yet to be licensed for veterinary use, several products, some specifically described as GS-441524, and others with proprietary names, are being sold through the internet to cat guardians who treat their own cats suffering from FIP.",

There is an urgent need of methods to prevent cats in high density environments such as breeding and rescue catteries becoming infected with FCoV. An FIP vaccine is licensed in some countries, but the first dose is administered at 16 weeks (Gerber et al., 1990) which is too late to protect kittens, that are usually infected when maternally derived antibody wanes at between 5-7 weeks of age (Addie and Jarrett, 1992 ; Pedersen et al, 1981) . At present, therefore, the major way to prevent FIP is to prevent exposure to the virus by quarantine and rigorous hygiene. FCoV transmission is faecal-oral; sharing litter trays with a FCoV shedder and fomite transmission are the major risk factors for uninfected cats. In dry indoor environments, FCoV can survive up to seven weeks in fomites (Scott 1988) .",

Some cat guardians have considered whether the drugs shown to cure FIP might also stop asymptomatic FCoV-infected cats shedding virus, thereby preventing them acting as a source of infection and providing a means to establish households of cats that are free of the virus. Mutian\u00ae X (Nantong Mutian Biotechnology Co. Ltd. China) is one of those products, it is formulated in capsules containing nicotinamide mononucleotide, Crocin I, S-Adenosylmethionine, Silymarin and Mutian X, which is a novel synthetic adenosine analogue (patent pending in China), exhibiting broadspectrum activity against RNA viruses (Tony Xue, CEO of Nantong, personal communication). Nucleoside analogues function by replacing adenosine, thus terminating replication of the RNA virus genome. Mutian X is efficacious by the oral route unlike previously described anti -coronavirus drugs, which must be given by painful injection, often causing severe inflammatory responses (Pedersen et al., 2019) , which is of concern for the development of feline injection site sarcoma.",

We present an observational study of cat guardians who were using Mutian X to stop their cats from shedding virus, and have defined a protocol which optimises and minimises its use. Furthermore, we hope that by stopping cats shedding FCoV, especially in purebred cats, the prevalence of FIP will reduce, which will further reduce the use of unlicensed drugs.",

We ask those holding such views to consider the following: first that this drug is already being used for the purpose of virus elimination by cat guardians and surely it is better that a proper protocol has been developed, rather than that they are left to do trial and error themselves? Second, we have found that an intensive four day course stopped virus shedding while cats being treated for FIP have higher virus loads (Kipar et al, 2006) and require a longer course of treatment, up to 12 weeks (Pedersen et al, 2019) , which surely is more likely to allow resistant virus strains to develop? Indeed, virus resistance to a nucleoside analogue was documented in a cat being treated for FIP (Pedersen et al, 2019) . Anti-virals are used prophylactically in other viral infections: there is precedent for this approach.",

The virus is highly contagious, and if cats are sharing litter trays, they will be rapidly re-infected, as was the experience in Households C and E, with large numbers of cats, even though they were kept in small groups. In Household C, re-infection of cat C6 occurred in less than 9 days: she was housed with one cat who had failed to clear the virus on a 2mg/kg dose of Mutian X; the cat litter used was sawdust based. It could be argued that Cat C6 was shedding virus intermittently, but she was housed in a group who had failed to clear virus at the2mg/kg dose, thus she was far more likely to have been re-infected than latently infected.",

The aim of this scatter plot was to determine whether cats that were shedding a higher amount of virus required more days of anti-viral treatment than cats with a lower virus quantity. Daily monitoring of faeces was available for 14 cats (there are 4 results at C T 23, two are overlaid which gives an appearance of 13 samples). Although there was a slight incline in the trendline, there was no correlation between starting FCoV RNA C T and days to a negative result (R=0.0048). prior to this study (immunohistochemistry was not performed to confirm diagnosis). FIP was suspected in a second cat (E14) and Mutian treatment was begun; but he had multicentric lymphoma, so the anti-viral drug was stopped. Cats were divided into three groups of up to eight cats. 10 cats became infected during the study period despite clumping bentonite-based cat litter being used.",

Cat A1 had effusive FIP diagnosed by a positive FCoV RT-qPCR test on ascites(Herrewegh et al, 1995;Longstaff et al., 2017). Cat A1 ceased virus shedding following treatment with FeIFN\u03c9, itraconazole, and GC376 protease inhibitor injections(Pedersen et al., 2018).Cat A1 was kept isolated from the other 3 cats and they were tested for FCoV shedding prior to reuniting them, in order not to re-infect Cat A1. Cat A2 stopped shedding virus subsequent to 7 injections of GC376 given because FIP was suspected, but his condition was a urinary tract infection which resolved with antibiotics. Thus Mutian X was only required for Cats A3 and A4. Dr Elsey Cat Attract cat litter was used and Cat A2 remained uninfected despite continued sharing of litter trays with cats A3 and A4.All four cats tested FCoV negative five months after their first negative faecal tests. Cat B1 was in contact with Cat B2 who was treated for FIP using Mutian X injections and tablets prior to this study. Cat B1 was shedding FCoV. Cats were routinely tested because this was a breeding cattery wishing to eliminate FCoV, and therefore FIP. Eight FIP deaths had occurred prior to testing beginning.At the start of the Mutian X treatment, 14 of 24 cats were shedding FCoV; one FCoV shedding cat (C10) was introduced during the study period (the breeder having confidence in her ability to stop Cat C10 shedding virus using Mutian X). Cats were kept in small groups of up to three cats. Sawdust based cat litter was used. Two of 10 negative cats became infected during the study period, bringing the total treated to 17. Cat D2 had effusive FIP diagnosed by a positive FCoV RT-qPCR test on ascites but was not shedding virus in the faeces. D1 was the housemate cat found to be shedding FCoV and was treated to avoid re-infecting cat D2. A 21 day itraconazole course had failed to stop Cat D1 shedding virus. One cat died of histopathologically suspected FIP J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

Then 3 days of 4mg/kg then negative. ** Cat C18 faecal sample was C T 38 at Day 6 and so the cat was re-treated for 3 days and subsequently became negative. This cat had vomited some of the capsules.This table shows the duration of 29 FCoV shedding cats either not treated, or treated with itraconazole, or FeIFN\u03c9 and probiotics, compared with duration of virus shedding on Mutian X treatment. Cats are organised according to their groups in their homes. Cats C6, C8 and C10 are listed twice. Although none of 25 cats for which pre-treatment records were available stopped shedding virus during the control period, this table does not show the virus shedding of untreated cats, two of which became negative in Household C prior to the study.",
