            "text": "Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) is the major causative agent of acute hepatitis in developing countries. Its genome has three open reading frames (ORFs)-called as ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3. ORF1 encodes nonstructural polyprotein having multiple domains, namely: Methyltransferase, Y domain, Protease, Macro domain, Helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In the present study, we show that HEV-macro domain specifically interacts with light chain subunit of human ferritin (FTL). In cultured hepatoma cells, HEV-macro domain reduces secretion of ferritin without causing any change in the expression levels of FTL. This inhibitory effect was further enhanced upon Brefeldin-A treatment. The levels of transferrin Receptor 1 or ferroportin, two important proteins in iron metabolism, remained unchanged in HEV-macro domain expressing cells. Similarly, there were no alterations in the levels of cellular labile iron pool and reactive oxygen species, indicating that HEV-macro domain does not influence cellular iron homeostasis/metabolism. As ferritin is an acute-phase protein, secreted in higher level in infected persons and HEV-macro domain has the property of reducing synthesis of inflammatory cytokines, we propose that by directly binding to FTL, macro domain prevents ferritin from entering into circulation and helps in further attenuation of the host immune response.",

Functional characterization of individual domains has been done by cloning, partial purification, and in vitro biochemical assays. Amino acid (aa) region 1-979 of the pORF1 has been shown to be responsible for capping of HEV genomic RNA [5] . Protease domain, aa 433-592, deubiquitinates both RIG-I and TBK-1 proteins, and ubiquitination is known to be a key step in the activation of these proteins for poly (I:C)-induced type I interferon (IFN) synthesis [6] . Macro domain, aa 775-960, binds to poly (A) and poly ADP-ribose and catalyzes hydrolysis of ADP-ribose1 00 -phosphate [7] . Helicase domain, aa 960-1204, hydrolyzes nucleotide triphosphates and unwinds RNA duplexes with 5 0 overhangs. It also possesses RNA 5 0 -triphosphatase activity [8, 9] . The RdRp domain, aa 1207-1693, can bind to 3 0 end of HEV genomic RNA and has the ability to synthesize complementary RNA strand [10] . Although these proteins are functionally characterized, their role during virus replication and pathogenesis are still not well defined.",

It is then reduced to ferrous ion (Fe 2? ) form and transported across endosomal membranes by a divalent metal transporter protein (DMT1), also known as Ferroportin (Fpn) and becomes part of the Labile Cell Iron (LCI) pool. Free iron can be utilized for metabolism, stored in oxidized form (Fe 3? ) in ferritin, or released back to extracellular space.

Level of secreted ferritin in cell culture supernatant was determined by ELISA. HEV-macro domain showed significant reduction in the secretion of ferritin in normal, iron-supplemented as well as irondepleted cells (Fig. 5) . These results indicate that irrespective of the labile iron levels in cells, HEV-macro domain has inhibitory effect on ferritin secretion. This effect was further enhanced when cells were treated with Brefeldin-A, suggesting a different mechanism of inhibition by macro domain than Brefeldin-A-mediated inhibition, which occurs due to blockade of classical secretory pathway. To see whether inhibitory effect of macro domain on ferritin secretion is also seen during HEV replication, we used HEV subgenomic replicon expressing Renilla luciferase reporter gene (pSK-E2-Luc). Huh-7 (S10-3) cells were transfected with in vitro synthesized RNA transcripts and virus replication was monitored for up to 6 days by performing dual luciferase assay.

Among total interacting cDNA clones, human FTL clones were abundant (30 % of the interacting cDNA clones). As we know that, Y2H screening has a tendency to show false-positive protein-protein interactions, we confirmed HEV-macro domain-FTL binary interaction by repeating the Y2H experiment.

By sequestering free iron in cells, ferritin serves dual function of iron detoxification and storage. It is composed of 24 subunits of light (FTL) and heavy (FTH) chain polypeptides with different proportion in different tissues [35] . Liver ferritin is mainly composed of light chain subunits of 175 amino acids [36, 37] . Viral macro domain proteins are known to bind to ADPR/poly ADPR moieties. As none of the amino acid residues in FTL are known to be ADP ribosylated, interaction between FTL and HEV-macro domain was intriguing. It indicated possible significance of this interaction in cellular iron metabolism. Iron metabolism is controlled at different levels [38] [39] [40] and involves more than 100 genes with interlinked pathways [41] . In the current study, it was observed that though macro domain directly interacted with FTL, it did not alter the expression of key proteins of iron metabolism such as FTL, TfR1, and Fpn. Macro domain also did not affect cellular levels of labile iron or reactive oxygen species (data not shown) suggesting other role of macro domain-FTL interaction. However, a quantitative proteomics study of liver tissues of HEV-infected swine has shown altered expressions of proteins related to iron metabolism [42] .",

Iron plays an important role during viral infection. This element is required by both host and virus for their survival [44] . Alteration in expression of iron regulatory proteins during viral infections are reported [45] [46] [47] [48] . Ferritin has been reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of certain viruses. It protects shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei from white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection by inhibiting virus replication, presumably by reducing iron availability [49] . Protein kinase 1 of WSSV interacts with shrimp ferritin and prevents it from iron loading, and thus stabilizes the cellular labile iron pool. This may be an assault mechanism of WSSV to counteract the host cell's iron-withholding defense mechanism [50] . Ferritin synthesis has been reported to be increased in mengovirusinfected cells to combat with the increased levels of free iron after virus infection [51] .

However, it has ability to inhibit secretion of ferritin. Cytokines seem to play an important role in ferritin turnover. Ferritin levels are known to increase in viral infections. Our study suggests that by directly interacting with FTL, HEV-macro domain inhibits its secretion and possibly suppresses innate immune response. Further, this interaction may also help in keeping the free iron level in cells, probably required for HEV genome replication. It may be a survival strategy of the virus. As indicated by the interactions of pORF1 domains with other proteins in iron metabolism, the viral intervention in the cellular iron metabolism could be complex and needs to be studied in an efficient cell culture model.
