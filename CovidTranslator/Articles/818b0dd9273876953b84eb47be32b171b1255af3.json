In January 2016, clinical diarrhea similar to that of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) with a lower mortality rate was reported on a swine farm in Lao PDR. Intestine samples were collected from 3-day-old pigs with clinical diarrhea and assayed for the presence of swine enteric coronaviruses. The PCR results were positive for PDCoV but negative for PEDV and TGEV. A phylogenetic tree demonstrated that PDCoV from Lao PDR was grouped separately from PDCoV isolates from China and the USA, but was more closely related to the Chinese isolates than to the US isolates. The full-length genome sequence of the novel PDCoV isolate P1_16_BTL_0116 was determined.",

The herd was a farrow-to-finisher herd with an inventory of 1,200 sows. The breeding herd had four breeding-gestating rooms and six farrowing rooms. Farrowing houses operate an all-in/all-out system on a weekly basis. Clinical abnormalities including vomiting and watery diarrhea were observed in early January 2016 in a litter of 3-day-old pigs. Diarrhea was then observed in 33 of 59 litters in the room within 12 hours. Two hundred fifty-seven of 603 pigs died 3 days later, and the consulting veterinarian ordered a planned exposure with intestines from pigs with diarrhea. All sows in the herd were orally administered infected intestine (feedback) for 3 consecutive days. The sow herd status resumed to normal approximately 3 weeks after feedback, and the breeding herd started to rear pigs with no clinical disease. A total of 637 pigs were lost in the outbreak.",

The full-length genome sequence of the isolate is 25,402 nucleotides (nt) in length. Its genome organization resembles to that of all previously sequenced PDCoV genomes, with the gene order 5 0 -ORF1a/1b-S-envelope (E)-membrane (M)-nonstructural protein 6 (Nsp6)-nucleocapsid (N)-nonstructural protein 7 (Nsp7)-3 0 . The lengths of ORF1a/1b, S, E, M, and N genes are 18,786 nt, 3,477 nt, 249 nt, 651 nt, and 1,026 nt, respectively. To determine the evolutionary relationships between P1_16_BTL_0116 and other PDCoVs available in GenBank, phylogenetic analysis was carried out based on the full-length genome sequence. The results of the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the P1_16_BTL_0116 isolate belongs to a new group of PDCoVs that are separated from both the Chinese and US groups (Fig. 1) Based on the S gene, the P1_16_BTL_0116 isolate is closely related to Chinese PDCoVs, with 95.7-96.9 % and 98.5-99.1 % nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity, respectively. It also shared sequence similarity with the US PDCoV isolate, with 96.2-96.5 % and 98.2-99.1 % identity at the nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively. Twentythree and 25 amino acid substitutions were observed in the Laos PDCoV isolate when compared to Chinese and US PDCoV isolates, respectively.
