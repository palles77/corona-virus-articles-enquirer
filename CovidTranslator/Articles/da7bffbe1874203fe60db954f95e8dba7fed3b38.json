            "text": "I. General mechanisms of neutropenia consist of decreased bone marrow production and tissue utilization exceeding marrow production and release (Box 65-2). II. Neutropenia can be secondary to increased margination, sequestration, hemophagocytic syndrome, and immunemediated damage to circulating neutrophils or granulocytic precursors in the bone marrow. III. Neutropenia can be a negative prognostic indicator associated with increased mortality; the more severe the neutropenia, the greater the risk of infection (Aroch et al., 2005) . IV. Neutropenia resulting from tissue utilization in excess of marrow production can occur with severe, localized bacterial infections involving body cavities, the uterus, the respiratory or gastrointestinal (GI) tracts, or during generalized septicemia. V. Neutropenia can be associated with neutrophil toxicity. VI. Marrow suppression resulting in decreased leukocyte production may arise with the following: A. Total body ionizing radiation B. Myelosuppression with chemotherapeutic agents (see Chapter 72) 1. Examples include cyclophosphamide, daunomycin, dimethyl myleran, doxorubicin, 6-thioguanine, azathioprine, cisplatin, carboplatin, chlorambucil, melphalan, methotrexate, mitoxantrone, and combination therapy with vincristine and Lasparaginase. 2. The marrow neutrophil proliferation-mitotic pool is most sensitive to chemotherapeutics. a. Differentiated cells in the maturation-storage pool are unaffected, so release of mature neutrophils continues for 5 to 10 days. b. A neutropenic nadir often occurs during these 5 to 10 days as a result of decreased marrow production and the short (6-hour) lifespan of the circulating neutrophil. 3. Chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia occurs in 1 to 2 weeks (circulating lifespan of platelets is 10 days). 4. Anemia is uncommon. C. Estrogen toxicosis in dogs 1. Sources of estrogen exposure include the following: a. Diethylstilbestrol or estradiol cyclopentylpropionate therapy used for mismating, urinary incontinence, or infertility in females may be a cause. b. With exogenous estrogen therapy for perianal gland tumors in males, pancytopenia can occur with the neutropenia. c. Excessive endogenous estrogen with interstitial and Sertoli cell tumors (males) and granulosa cell tumors (females) can also be associated with pancytopenia. 2. Sequential hematological abnormalities in canine estrogen toxicosis consist of the following: a. Immediate leukocytosis followed by rapid leukopenia b. Thrombocytosis followed by rapid thrombocytopenia c. Slow development of anemia and pancytopenia within 1 month D. Prolonged (14 to A. Hematology fi ndings consist of cytopenias involving two or more of the hematologic cell lines and circulating fragments of erythrocytes. B. Bone marrow aspirate reveals increased numbers of macrophages containing phagocytized hematopoietic precursors, and predominantly erythroid precursors, with fewer neutrophils and platelets. X. Uncommon causes of neutropenia include the following:",
