Within the framework of the Sino-French Cooperation Agreement on Emerging Infectious Diseases Prevention and Control (2) signed in October 2004, China constructed its first BSL-4 laboratory, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory (Level 4) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 2015. During construction, prospective BSL-4 laboratory staff members visited France, the United States, or Australia for BSL-4 training and capacity building. After 2 years of testing and commissioning, Wuhan BSL-4 laboratory passed a series of assessments, and the China National Accreditation Service for Conformity Assessment certified it as meeting the highest biosafety standard in January 2017 (3) . In August 2017, the National Health Commission of China approved research activities involving Ebola, Nipah, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses at the Wuhan BSL-4 laboratory (4) .",

Many recorded laboratory accidents are related to personnel error. Qualified staff ensure the efficacy and safety of a high-containment laboratory. Developing an appropriate and rigorous BSL-4 laboratory user training system is an essential prerequisite for ensuring the safety of laboratory workers, operations, and the environment (5,6). We designed a training program for BSL-4 laboratory users that follows local, national, and international guidelines and regulations. Our program ensures the safety and security of staff involved in research at the Wuhan BSL-4 laboratory.",

Before being admitted to the training program, applicants must demonstrate proficient work experience in lower containment level laboratories, particularly BSL-3, and undergo medical examinations and security checks. We constructed a realistic training laboratory with bioseal doors, pressure sensors, a chemical shower room, air connection ports, biosafety cabinets (BSCs), an autoclave, and general laboratory Figure, panel A) . In this laboratory, trainees gain experience wearing a positive-pressure suit ( Figure, panel B) and become familiar with working in the BSL-4 environment without actually handling microbes. To ensure documentation of all training, we developed online training management software, which supports registration, staff pre-assessment, needs assessments, a theoretical examination, record keeping, and analysis of training efficiency. The training team is composed of existing trained staff or outsourced qualified mentors. Currently, we include 3 categories of trainees according to their duties: laboratory managers or biosafety professionals, operations or maintenance staff members, and researchers or technicians who work with infectious agents in vitro or in vivo.",
