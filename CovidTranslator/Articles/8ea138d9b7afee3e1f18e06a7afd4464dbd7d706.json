To evaluate the mechanisms behind this event, we investigated the roles of SARS-CoV proteins in the regulation of IL-6. Results showed that the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein activated IL-6 expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Promoter analyses suggested that NF-\u03baB binding element was required for IL-6 expression regulated by N protein. Further studies demonstrated that N protein bound directly to NF-\u03baB element on the promoter. We also showed that N protein activated IL-6 expression through NF-\u03baB by facilitating the translocation of NF-\u03baB from cytosol to nucleus. Mutational analyses revealed that two regions of N protein were essential for its function in the activation of IL-6. These results provided new insights into understanding the mechanism involved in the function of SARS-CoV N protein and pathogenesis of the virus.",

In particular, N protein binds to a defined packaging signal on viral RNA, leading to the formation of the helical nucleocapsid (Narayanan et al., 2003) . A similar function of N protein has been found in other viruses, in addition to coronaviruses (Myers and Moyer, 1997) . However, the mechanism by which N protein facilitates virus replication is not established. The N protein of SARS-CoV is 422 amino acids long, sharing only 20-30% homology with the N proteins of other coronaviruses (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . However, it contains a short lysine-rich sequence (362-KTFPPTEPKKDKKKKTDEAQ-381) near the carboxyl terminus, a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal that has not been found in the N proteins of any other known coronavirus (Marra et al., 2003) , suggesting the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein might have novel functions in pathogenesis. The SARS-CoV N protein has been reported to activate the activator protein 1 (AP1) signal transduction pathway (He et al., 2003) and to induce actin reorganization in COS-1 cells (Sutjit et al., 2004 ) by forming a dimmer by self-association (He et al., 2004) .",

IL-6 Virology 365 (2007) 324 -335 www.elsevier.com/locate/yviro expression is known to be affected by a variety of cytokines and growth factors. It has been reported that activation of IL-6 expression is controlled by the activity of several transcription factors with known consensus sequences in the IL-6 promoter region, including IRF-1 (\u2212 267 to \u2212 254), AP-1 (\u2212 283 to \u2212 277), C/EBP (\u2212 158 to \u2212 145 and \u2212 87 to \u2212 76), Sp1 (\u2212 123 to \u2212 119 and \u2212 108 to \u2212 104), and NF-\u03baB (\u2212 75 to \u2212 63) binding sites (Akira and Kishimoto, 1992; Yan et al., 1995) . NF-\u03baB belongs to the Rel family of transcription factors that form homo-or heterodimers through the Rel homology domain (Akira and Kishimoto, 1997; Sen and Baltimore, 1986) . In most cells, NF-\u03baB is present in the cytoplasm bound to a member of the I\u03baB family of inhibitors (Verma et al., 1995; Carlotti et al., 2000) . Upon activation of the cells by cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1, viruses, bacteria, or mitogens, I\u03baB is phosphorylated and then rapidly degraded allowing the translocation of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus where it binds to specific DNA binding sites. High serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in the acute stage (cytokine storm) associated with lung lesions were found in SARS patients (Hsueh et al., 2004) . However, the molecular mechanisms behind this event remain to be determined. In this study, we investigated the roles of SARS-CoV structural proteins in the regulation of IL-6 expression in human lung epithelial cells (A549). In addition, transcription factor involved in the regulation of IL-6 by the viral N protein was also studied. This study partially explains the clinical observation of dramatic cytokine storm and inflammation responses in SARS patients and provides new insights into our understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the functions of SARS-CoV N protein and pathogenesis caused by the SARS-CoV.",

Nuclear extracts were prepared from transfected cells and EMSA was performed with 4 \u03bcg of nuclear extract in binding buffer. To assure the specific binding of transcription factors to the probe, unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide competitors were added prior to the addition of labeled probe (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 5) . To determine whether N protein was specific bound to the promoter, rabbit anti-N polyclonal antibody (Fig. 5A, lanes 1 and 4) or normal rabbit polyclonal antibody (rabbit IgG) (Fig. 5A , lane 8) was incubated with nuclear extracts before adding the binding buffer. DNA probes used in this study were specific for the NF-\u03baB recognition Tag2B -N and pIL6luc-651 followed by the treatment with MG-132 at different concentrations as indicated for 24h.

Immunoprecipitated complexes were collected, subjected to PCR amplification, and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The IL-6 promoter regions (\u2212 225 to +13) and (\u2212 76 to +13) were amplified by PCR using specific primers (IL-6-225U and IL-6-651D or IL-6-76U and IL-6-651D), respectively.

We also demonstrated that N protein activates the IL-6 promoter (Fig. 1D ) and induces IL-6 protein production (Fig. 1E) in A549 cells. These results were consistent with previous clinical findings (Hsueh et al., 2004) and further demonstrated that N protein is, at lease partially, responsible for the induction of IL-6 gene expression. Studies of other coronavirus have reported that the nucleocapsid proteins have a variety of functional activities (He et al., 2004) . It has been suggested recently that N protein is a twodomain protein, with the N-terminal from amino acids 50 to 150 as the RNA-binding domain. Our recent results indicated that N protein activates COX-2 gene expression by binding either directly or indirectly to NF-\u03baB and C/EBP regulatory elements on COX-2 promoter (Yan et al., 2006) . Previous studies of the IL-6 promoter indicated optimal IL-6 activation correlated with the NF-\u03baB sites both in vivo and in vitro. IL-6 gene activation involves the rapid transport of preexisting p65 to the nucleus after release from a complex with I\u03baB in the cytosol (Lieberman and Baltimore, 1990) .",

In this study, we demonstrated that NF-\u03baB regulatory element was essential for N protein function in the induction of IL-6 expression since mutation of such binding site eliminated the activation of IL-6 induced by N protein (Fig. 2) . Such mutation of IL-6 promoter also abolished the effect of p65 (a subunit of NF-\u03baB) and/or N protein on the activation of IL-6 promoter (Figs. 3B and C). In addition, results from electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) (Fig. 5A ) and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) (Fig.  5B ) demonstrated that SARS-CoV N protein could bind directly to NF-\u03baB regulatory elements on IL-6 gene promoter.",

In this study, we further demonstrated that the viral N protein is required for the activation of NF-\u03baB in the regulation of IL-6 expression. Our results revealed that the activity of IL-6 promoter induced by N protein was eliminated by the presence of NF-\u03baB inhibitor, MG-132 (Fig. 3A) . In addition, we also showed that the viral N protein and the host transcription factor p65 protein had a synergetic effect on the activation of IL-6 (Figs. 3B and C), such effect was abolished when NF-\u03baB recognition site was mutated (Fig. 3B) . Finally, we found that N protein facilitates the translocation of p65 from cytosol to nucleus (Fig. 4A) . However, the detailed mechanisms involved in the activation of IL-6 expression regulated by the viral N protein and the transcriptional factor NF-\u03baB need to be further investigated.",

Monolayer of A549 cells (70% confluent) was incubated for 24 h after transfection, and then formaldehyde was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1%. The cells were then washed twice in PBS, scraped, and lysed in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM PMSF, 50 mg/ml of both aprotinin, and leupeptin) for 10 min on ice. The lysates were sonicated on ice and the debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. One-fourth of the supernatant was used as DNA input control. The remaining supernatant was diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mM NaCl) and incubated with antibody against N protein overnight at 4\u00b0C. Immunoprecipitated complexes were collected using protein A/G agarose beads. The pellets were washed with dialysis buffer (2 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Samples were incubated at 67\u00b0C for 5 h to reverse formaldehyde crosslink. DNA was precipitated with ethanol and extracted three times with phenol/chloroform. Finally, pellets were resuspended in TE buffer and subjected to PCR amplification using IL-6 promoter specific detection primer (Table 1 ). The PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis.",

The crude nuclei were collected by centrifugation for 30 s; pellets were rinsed with buffer A, resuspended in 1 packed cell volume of buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 420 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, and 1.0 mM DTT), and incubated on a rocking platform for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. Nuclei were clarified by centrifugation for 5 min, and the supernatants were diluted 1:1 with buffer C (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mM DTT). Cocktail protease inhibitor tablets were added to each type of buffer. Nuclear extracts were frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at \u2212 70\u00b0C until use. NF-\u03baB oligonucleotides were synthesized by Takara (Takara Biotech Co. Ltd., Japan) based on the cognate human IL-6 promoter sequence (Table 4 ). The complimentary oligonucleotides were annealed and purified according to the manufacture's protocol. Each probe was end-labeled with [\u03b3 32 P] ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara biotech). EMSA was performed by incubating 2 \u03bcg of nuclear extract with a labeled probe (15,000 cpm, 10 fmol) in binding buffer (4 mM Tris-HCl, 12 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 60 mM KCl, 12% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT) containing 1 \u03bcg of poly(dI \u2212 dC) for 25 min at room temperature. To assure the specific binding of transcription factors to the probe, the probe was chased by 100-fold molar excess of cold wild-type. For supershift experiments, 2 \u03bcg of purified polyclonal antibody was incubated with nuclear extracts on ice for 30 min before adding to the binding buffer. Samples were electrophorased on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with running buffer (0.25\u00d7 TBE containing 22.5 mM Tris-borate, 0.5 mM EDTA), and the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography.",
