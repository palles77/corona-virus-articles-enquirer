            "text": "Tunicamycin has different effects on the glycosylation of the two envelope glycoproteins of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus. Unlike envelope glycoproteins of other viruses, the transmembrane glycoprotein El is glycosylated normally in the presence of tunicamycin. This suggests that glycosylation of El does not involve transfer of core oligosaccharides from dolichol pyrophosphate intermediates to asparagine residues, but may occur by O-linked glycosylation of serine or threonine residues. Synthesis of the peplomeric glycoprotein E2 is not readily detectable in the presence of tunicamycin. Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation of E2 by tunicamycin either prevents synthesis or facilitates degradation of the protein moiety of E2. Radiolabeling with carbohydrate precursors and borate gel electrophoresis of glycopeptides show that different oligosaccharide side chains are attached to El and E2. The two coronavirus envelope glycoproteins thus appear to be glycosylated by different mechanisms. In tunicamycin-treated cells, noninfectious virions lacking peplomers are formed at intracytoplasmic membranes and released from the cells. These virions contain normal amounts of nucleocapsid protein and glycosylated El, but lack E2. Thus the transmembrane glycoprotein El is the only viral glycoprotein required for the formation of the viral envelope or for virus maturation and release. The peplomeric glycoprotein E2 appears to be required for attachment to virus receptors on the plasma membrane. The coronavirus envelope envelope glycoprotein El appears to be a novel type of viral glycoprotein which is post-translationally glycosylated by a tunicamycin-resistant process that yields oligosaccharide side chains different from those of N-linked glycoproteins. These findings suggest that El may be particularly useful as a model for studying the biosynthesis, glycosylation, and intracellular transport of O-linked glycoproteins.",

Oligosaccharides may also be Olinked to serine or threonine residues of the polypeptide chain by a process which is less well understood (Sharon and Lis, 1981) .

These viruses cause a variety of respiratory, enteric, or neurological diseases in animals and man (Andrewes et & 1978) . The virions of the A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus contain three structural polypeptides: a phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein N, and two glycoproteins El and E2 which have several interesting properties (Sturman, 1977; Sturman and Holmes, 1977; Sturman et cd, 1980; Sturman, 1981) . The glycoprotein E2 forms the large petal-shaped peplomers characteristic of the coronavirus envelope. E2 is a 18OK-dalton glycoprotein which can be cleaved by trypsin to yield two 90K components. The glycoprotein El appears to be a transmembrane molecule with three domains: A glycosylated domain projects from the envelope, a second domain lies within the membrane, and a third domain appears to interact with the nucleocapsid inside the viral envelope.

Tunicamycin, an analog of UDP-Nacetylglucosamine, interferes with the formation of dolichol pyrophosphate-hracetylglucosamine which acts as a carrier for N-glycosidic linkage of core oligosaccharides to asparagine residues on glycoproteins. Tunicamycin interferes with the cotranslational glycosylation of glycoproteins (Takatsuki et al, 1971; Lehle and Tanner, 1976; Schwarz et al, 1979) . We have demonstrated that tunicamycin inhibits formation of the E2 glycoprotein of MHV, but does not prevent synthesis or glycosylation of the transmembrane glycoprotein El, formation of virions, or release of virions from cells. Our evidence indicates that the unique El glycoprotein of the coronavirus may be an O-linked glycoprotein, and thus could be a particularly useful model for studying the synthesis, glycosylation, and intracellular transport of O-linked glycoproteins in mammalian cells.",

Without tunicamycin, a 15-min pulse label with rH]leucine 8 hr after virus inoculation showed synthesis of the three structural polypeptides El, N, and E2 ( Fig. 1 , channels l-8). No high-molecular-weight polyproteins were detected. Thus each structural polypeptide appears to be translated inedpendently, as also shown by in vitro translation studies with isolated MHV mRNAs (Siddell et c& 1980; Rottier et cd, 1981) . During successive chase periods, no shift in the molecular weight of the nucleocapsid protein N or the peplomeric glycoprotein E2 was observed. Since the E2 glycoprotein is known to be extensively glycosylated (Sturman, 1977; Sturman and Holmes, 197'7) , this suggests either that glycosylation of E2 is a cotranslational event and/or that the glycosylated and nonglycosylated E2 are not resolved in this region of the gradient slab gel. Pulsechase experiments with labeling at 6,8, or 10 hr after infection show that El is synthesized as a 20K species and then chased up to a broad band of up to 23K (not apparent in Fig. 1 , channels 7 and 8 due to overexposure). Double labeling studies of intracellular viral polypeptides demonstrated that the 20K form of El is not glycosylated whereas the 23K species can be labeled with PHlglucosamine (data not shown). Antibody against El purified from NP40-disrupted virions by sucrose density gradient sedimentation immunoprecipitates the broad band of El from 20K to 23K (Sturman et cd, 1980) . Similar pulse-chase radiolabeling studies were performed on cells infected with MHV, treated with 0.5 pg/ml of tunicamycin, and labeled with [8H]leucine ( Fig.  1 , channels 9-16). Synthesis of the nonglycosylated nucleocapsid protein N was not affected by tunicamycin.",

This glycoprotein can be purified in large amounts from virions released from tunicamycin-treated cells. Thus, the coronavirus glycoprotein El may be a useful model for analysis of the synthesis, gly-cosylation, and intracellular transport of O-linked glycoproteins.",
