However, the role of lncRNAs in 26 antiviral innate immune responses remains largely unexplored. Here, we identify an 27 uncharacterized human lncRNA from influenza A virus (IAV) patients, antivirus and activate 28 neutrophil (AVAN), that is significantly up-regulated upon virus infection. Mechanistically, 29 nuclear lncRNA-AVAN positively regulates the transcription of forkhead box O3A (FOXO3a) 30 by associating with its promoter and inducing chromatin remodeling to promote neutrophil 31 chemotaxis. Furthermore, we also found that cytoplasmic lncRNA-AVAN directly binds 32 tripartite motif containing 25 (TRIM25) and enhances the association of TRIM25 and 33 Retinoic acid inducible gene-1 proteins (RIG-I) and the ubiquitylation of RIG-I, thereby 34 promoting TRIM25-and RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immune signaling. More 35 importantly\uff0cwe enforced the expression of AVAN in transgenic mice and found that it 36 significantly alleviated IAV virulence and virus production. Collectively, these findings 37 highlight the potential clinical implications of lncRNA-AVAN as a key positive regulator of 38 the antiviral innate immune response and a promising target for developing broad antiviral 39 therapeutics. 40 41",

Previous studies have shown that lncRNAs 50 exert their roles in regulating chromatin accessibility, mRNA stability and protein activity by 51 interacting with chromatin DNA, mRNAs or proteins (15-18). With the discovery and 52 characterization of an increasing number of lncRNAs, several mechanisms of these lncRNAs 53 in virus-host interactions have been elucidated (19, 20) , however, many others remain 54 uncharacterized. recovery-stage counterparts (FC>2, p<0.05) and subjected them to a cluster analysis ( Fig 1B) . 100 To investigate the association between lncRNAs and IAV infection, in silico analysis 101 identified 26 novel lncRNAs candidates with notably aberrant expression (Fig 1C) . To 102 confirm the expression of these lncRNAs, we separated the neutrophils and monocytes from 103 healthy volunteers and infected the cells with influenza virus A/Beijing/501/2009 (abbreviated 104 as IAV-BJ501 or BJ501) for 12 h and found that XLOC_040025 (AVAN) was most 105 significantly up-regulated after IAV-BJ501 challenge (Fig 1D, E) . We also infected human 106 alveolar epithelial cells (A549) with IAV-BJ501 and measured the expression of the 26 lncRNAs and found that AVAN was most strongly up-regulated after IAV-BJ501 infection (Fig   108   1F ). 109 110 AVAN is preferentially up-regulated following virus infection 111 We then performed qRT-PCR to quantify AVAN expression in the RNA-Seq samples and 112 found that the results were consistent with the RNA-Seq data ( Fig S2A) . Thus, AVAN was 113 chosen for subsequent investigation. To further confirm the expression of AVAN in 114 IAV-infected patients, we collected blood samples from 63 additional IAV-positive patients 115 and measured the expression of AVAN, which was significantly up-regulated in the neutrophils 116 of these patients (Fig 2A; Table S1 ). Similarly, AVAN was up-regulated in A549 cells after 117 infection with multiple sub-strains of IAV ( Fig 2B) and several other RNA viruses, including 118 Sendai virus (SeV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) \uff0c but not the DNA virus, adenovirus 119 (ADV) (Fig S2B) . In addition, Poly (I:C), IFN-\u03b2 also could significantly stimulate the 120 expression of AVAN ( Fig S2B) . Moreover, AVAN expression was significantly up-regulated 121 upon IAV-BJ501 challenge in a time-and dose-dependent manner in A549 cells (Fig 2C, D) . 122 Absolute copy number measurement showed that AVAN was expressed at relatively low 123 levels without infection, with 11 or 14 transcript copies in per neutrophil or A549 cell 124 respectively ( Figure S2 ). Additionally, AVAN expression was also significantly up-regulated in 125 a time-and dose-dependent manner in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL60), 126 which is often a substitute for neutrophils, upon IAV-BJ501 challenge (Fig S2B, C) . 127 Subcellular fractionation followed by qRT-PCR in IAV-BJ501-infected A549 cells revealed labeling-probes was weaken (Fig S2E) . AVAN exhibits no protein-coding potential according 135 to ORF finder (33) and the coding potential calculator (34) (Fig S2F) . Only one transcript 136 variant (approximately 500 nt) of AVAN was found in A549 cells, and it was found to be 137 up-regulated upon IAV-BJ501 infection using northern blot analysis ( Fig 2G) . The exact 138 transcript length (517 nt) of AVAN was confirmed by 5' and 3' RACE (Table S2) , which 139 revealed that AVAN is polyadenylated (Fig S2G) . Taken together, lncRNA expression profiling Table S3 -S8), suggesting that AVAN participates in innate antiviral immunity. To 149 identify the functions of AVAN, we generated AVAN-overexpressing A549 cells ( Fig 3A) and 150 found that viral replication was strongly inhibited (Fig 3B) . In contrast, virus titer was up-regulated following AVAN knockdown with two specific siRNAs (Fig 3H, I (Fig 3C) . To confirm this result, we performed ELISA to measure IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 protein 160 expression and found that IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 were strongly up-regulated in 161 AVAN-overexpressing A549 cells during IAV-BJ501 infection ( Fig 3D) . Conversely, these 162 phenomena were abolished by knocking down AVAN (Fig 3J, K) . 163 The above GSEA data and GO analysis showed that the genes related to AVAN were also 164 significantly enriched in chemotaxis and immune cell activation (Fig S4A, Table S9 , S10), the 165 main components of innate immune responses. To explore the role of AVAN in chemotaxis, we 166 collected culture supernatants of AVAN-overexpressing A549cells and performed neutrophil 167 transwell assays, which revealed that AVAN overexpression significantly up-regulated 168 neutrophil chemotaxis during IAV-BJ501 infection (Fig 3E) . These phenomena were disrupted 169 by knocking down AVAN (Fig 3L) . The chemokines interleukin-8 (CXCL8, IL-8) is potent 170 neutrophil chemoattractant (38) and is released by a variety of lung cells, including 171 macrophages and epithelial cells as well as neutrophils themselves (39). IL-8 primarily 172 attracts neutrophils and induces them to release lysosomal enzymes, triggering the respiratory 173 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

In contrast, AVAN knockdown abolished these changes (Fig S7E,   285 right). To test whether AVAN enhances the IFN-mediated antiviral innate immune response 286 through TRIM25 and RIG-I signaling, we performed qPCR analysis measuring 287 IFN-alpha/beta upon AVAN transfection, and then individually knock down RIG-I or TRIM25. 288 The results showed that knock down RIG-I or TRIM25 abrogated AVAN-induced effects on 289 IFN-alpha/beta expression during IAV-BJ501 infection (Fig 6M, N, Fig S7F, G) .

Pathologic examination by HE attaining revealed that histopathlogic 307 alterations improved in TG mice ( Fig 7F) . Subsequently, we detected FOXO3a expression 308 levels and found that FOXO3a expression were undetectable in TG mice (data not shown), 309 likely due to low AVAN homology in humans and mice. Striking, we found that AVAN also 310 bind to rodent TRIM25 through RNA pull-down using TG mice tissue ( Fig 7G) and promote 311 type I IFN expression in vivo (Fig 7H) . Similarly, we constructed an AVAN-containing 312 AAV2/9 vector and a control vector, which were then delivered into 4-week-old C57L/B6 313 mice via intranasal (i.n.) administration. We found that AVAN was ectopically expressed in the 314 lung of AAV2/9-AVAN treated mice ( Fig S8A) . Strikingly, after IAV-BJ501 infection, the 315 groups pretreated with AAV2/9-AVAN exhibited significantly increased survival rates and 316 reduced body weight loss at 10 days post-infection compared with the control group ( Fig S8B,   317 C). Furthermore, lung edema, measured as the wet-to-dry ratio of whole lung, was 318 ameliorated (Fig S8D) , and improved lung histopathology was observed in infected mice 319 pretreated with AAV2/9-AVAN (Fig S8E, F) . Moreover, the virus titer from the lungs of 320 infected mice was also significantly reduced in AAV2/9-AVAN-treated mice compared with 321 that in control mice (Fig S8G, H) . In addition, AAV2/9-AVAN promote type I IFN expression 322 in vivo (Fig S8I) . Taken together, these observations indicate that expression of lncRNA AVAN The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/623132 doi: bioRxiv preprint association between TRIM25 and RIG-I and enhances RIG-I ubiquitylation, thereby 393 promoting IFN expression. It is worth noting that AVAN binds TRIM25 and facilitates IFN 394 expression in mice. In addition, we explored the impact of AVAN overexpression or 395 knockdown in IFN induction, chemo attraction of neutrophils or expression of cytokines and 396 chemokines (Fig 3) , speculated that lncRNA AVAN is critical in the IFN induction pathway. 1/4 volume of 5\u00d7 loading dye.

Increasing evidence 60 suggests that neutrophils are also prominent components of the inflammatory and immune 61 responses during virus infection. Neutrophils are rapidly recruited to sites of infection during 62 the innate immune response to IAV (25-27).

Previous studies have described several lncRNAs that are differentially expressed 330 during viral infection, including in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 331 (SARS-CoV)-infected mice, IAV-infected human lung cells and enterovirus 71 332 (EV71)-infected rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells (53-55). However, little is known about the 333 lncRNA profile of influenza patients. In this study, we profiled the transcriptome of 334 neutrophils isolated from IAV-infected patients via RNA-Seq technology for the first time. 335 Through a comprehensive analysis of these data, we identified 404 differentially expressed 336 mRNAs and 433 differentially expressed noncoding RNAs in neutrophils of influenza patients. 337 Among these highly expressed genes, we found an lncRNA named AVAN that plays a pivotal 338 role in antiviral responses. 339 Several studies have shown that differentially expressed lncRNAs function as negative or 340 positive regulators in various critical steps of the antiviral response (56). For example, BISPR 341 lncRNA can regulate the antiviral IFN response through the induction of the expression of the 342 genomically neighboring gene BST2 in cis. Another IAV-associated intronic antisense 343 lncRNA, negative regulator of antiviral response (NRAV), modulates antiviral responses by 344 suppressing ISG transcription via altered histone modifications (52). A recent study show that 345 lnc-Lsm3b can compete with viral RNAs in the binding of RIG-I monomers and involve in 346 RIG-I-mediated antiviral response (57). In contrast, Herein, our data displayed that AVAN acts 347 as a positive regulator in the antivirus response through two different mechanisms. I-mediated antiviral innate immune signaling. In the other hand, nuclear lncRNA-AVAN 351 positively regulates the transcription of forkhead box O3A (FOXO3a) in nucleus by 352 associating with its promoter and inducing chromatin remodeling to enhance a member of the Forkhead box O (FoxO) family of transcription factors, 355 which is a PTEN/PI3K/AKT effector functioning in diverse cellular activities such as the 356 induction of cell-cycle arrest, stress resistance, apoptosis, differentiation, and metabolism 357 (58-60). FOXO3a reportedly functions as a major transcriptional regulator in the maintenance 358 of neutrophil activation during inflammation (61). However, little is known about the function 359 of FOXO3a during the immune response in epithelial cells. Previous research demonstrated 360 that FOXO3a repressed cytokine expression induced by LPS or bacteria (47). In this study, 361 FOXO3a plays a different function during IAV infection. FOXO3a promotes IL-8 expression 362 in IAV-BJ501-infected A549 cells, which additionally enhances neutrophil chemotaxis. AVAN 363 is located 1449-bp upstream of FOXO3a. We found that lncRNA-AVAN can markedly 364 increase FOXO3a expression through chromatin remodeling in A549 cells. Additionally, 365 AVAN can enhance neutrophil chemotaxis by upregulating the expression of IL-8. However, 366 knockdown FOXO3a blocked the upregulation of IL-8 by AVAN. In the other hand, to confirm 367 how much of the rise in the level of FOXO3a after AVAN overexpression is the result of 368 enhanced IFN response, as opposed to a direct impact by AVAN on FOXO3a locus, we also 369 used HL60 cells to evade IFN effects (data not shown here). Meanwhile, as seen in Figure mutant AVAN that can induce IFN response similar to WT AVAN but can't bind the 373 FOXO3a promoter or change its expression level in subsequently studies. In addition, our 374 results exhibited that neutrophils were isolated from fresh peripheral blood and were infected 375 in vitro with influenza virus does not mimic their actual status in vivo. How and where AVAN 376 is induced in neutrophils need to be further investigated. Thus, we propose that AVAN may 377 enhance neutrophil chemotaxis through the regulation of FOXO3a expression. -inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) play a well-known role in 381 RNA virus recognition (62). Previous reports have shown that RIG-I is the main host sensor 382 involved in recognizing cytoplasmic viral RNA and subsequently initiating immune responses 383 to eliminate infection. TRIM25, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is critically important in the RIG-I 384 signaling pathway. TRIM25 interacts with the CARD1 region of RIG-I and enhances RIG-I 385 polyubiquitylation to initiate RIG-I-mediated antivirus responses (50). A previous study found 386 that viruses have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to evade the host immune response 387 through regulating the role of TRIM25. IAV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) specifically 388 inhibits TRIM25-mediated RIG-I CARD ubiquitination, thereby suppressing the RIG-I 389 signaling pathway (63). Our results demonstrated that the host can also regulate TRIM25 to 390 increase the immune response. AVAN can directly bind with the B box/central CCD of 391 TRIM25 in A549 cells.
