Based on activity, the strains Probio-38 and Probio-37 were selected as potential probiotics and identified as Lactobacillus plantarum Probio-38 and Lactobacillus salivarius Probio-37 respectively by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Supernatants of these strains inhibited TGE coronavirus in vitro in ST cells, without any cytopathic effect even after 72 h of incubation. Both the strains exhibited high survival in synthetic gastric juice. The strains were resistant to 5% porcine bile and exhibited antimicrobial activity against all the 13 enteric bacterial pathogens tested. These strains also exhibited resistance to most of the antibiotics analyzed. The inhibition of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus and enteric bacterial pathogens as well as the bile tolerance, high survival in gastric juice, and the antibiotic resistance indicate that the two isolated bacterial strains are ideal probiotic candidates for animal application after proper in vivo experiments.",

Several agents including viruses, bacteria, and protozoans have been suggested as possible causes of diarrhea in growing pigs (Jacobson et al. 2003) . Among these, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) caused by coronavirus is a highly contagious enteric disease resulting in a mortality of nearly 100% (Pritchard 1987) . It is a major cause of viral enteritis and fetal diarrhea in swine; it is most severe in neonates, with mortality resulting in significant economic loss . TGE virus is a member of the Coronaviridae family of the order Nidovirales (Cavanagh et al. 1997) . TGEV replicates in both the villous epithelial cells of the small intestine and in the lung cells of newborn piglets (Enjuanes and Van der Zeijst 1995) . Enteric bacterial infections are also among the most common and economically significant diseases affecting swine production with clinical signs of diarrhea, reduced growth rate, weight loss, and death of preweaned, weanling, grower finisher, and young and adult age breeding animals (Moxley and Duhamel 1999) .",

            "text": "Lactobacillus species have been widely used in both humans and animals to prevent or treat gastrointestinal disorders (Drago et al. 1997; Ouwehand et al. 2004) . Lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, which lowers the pH of the intestinal content and helps to inhibit the development of invasive pathogens such as Salmonella spp. or strains of Escherichia coli. Lactobacillus species are reported to have beneficial effects in the gastrointestinal tract in experimental rats (Mangell et al. 2002) . Weaned piglets fed with diet supplements of different lactic acid bacteria (LAB) complexes, comprising combinations of Enterococcus faecium 6H2, Lactobacillus acidophilus C3, Pediococcus pentosaceus D7, Lactobacillus plantarum 1K8, and L. plantarum 3K2 were less affected by diarrhea than piglets fed the control diet, suggesting that the LAB complexes tested have probiotic properties in weaned piglets (Giang et al. 2010) . Besides its antibacterial activity, many researchers reported the antiviral activity of Lactobacillus species against different human and animal viruses. Studies found that L. acidophilus has significant immunopotentiating effects and recommended for use as safe oral adjuvant for rotavirus vaccines in pigs (Van Niel et al. 2002; Zhang et al. 2008) . Oral administration of Lactobacillus assists vaccination efficiency against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and also provides higher bodyweight gain following PRRS infection (Kritas and Morrison 2007) . In the present study, we screened 310 bacterial isolates from porcine gastrointestinal tract against TGE coronavirus and enteric bacterial pathogens to select the potent probiotic species.",

Bacterial isolates were tested for TGE corona virus inhibition in vitro in ST cells. Viral inoculum was prepared as follows: The virus suspension was allowed to adsorb for 30 min onto a monolayer of ST cells washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were incubated in serum-free minimal essential medium Eagle (MEM) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO 2 until there is cytopathic effect (CPE) in 70% of the cells. The cells along with the medium were frozen and thawed twice, and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was stored at \u221270\u00b0C until use. This supernatant was used for the estimation of viral titer in 96well microplate cultures of ST cells. Ten-fold serial dilutions of the viral inoculum were prepared, and each dilution was inoculated into 10 wells. Control wells devoid of the inoculum were also maintained. After 72 h, CPE was observed ( Fig. 1 ) and tissue culture infectious dose, TCID 50 /mL, was calculated according to the method of Reed and Muench (1938) . For the antiviral assay, bacterial supernatant was prepared from 24-h-old culture of bacterial isolates grown in MRS medium. Supernatant collected by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min was incubated at 70\u00b0C for 5 min and filter-sterilized using cellulose acetate membrane (0.22 \u03bcm). The viral inoculum was diluted with serum-free MEM, and 90 \u03bcL was added to each well of 96-well monolayer culture of ST cells immediately followed by the addition of 10 \u03bcL of bacterial supernatant so that the final viral titers were 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 TCID 50 /0.1ml. Quadruplicate wells were maintained for each concentration of the virus. Control cells with viral inoculum (1 to 1,000 TCID 50 / 0.1ml) but without bacterial supernatant, with bacterial supernatant but without viral inoculum, and with serumfree MEM alone were also maintained. The plate was observed for CPE at 24, 48, and 72 h, and the absence of CPE was regarded as presence of antiviral activity.",

Both the strains showed the maximum resistance at 5.0% and formed cloudy zones of precipitate in the growth media by producing bile salt hydrolase (Dashkevicz and Feighner 1989) . The antibiotic sensitivity assay showed that both the strains exhibited resistance to broadly used antibiotics (Table 3) . However, L. plantarum Probio-38 was highly sensitive to ampicillin, carbencillin, and erythromycin, whereas L. salivarius was also sensitive to cephalothin along with other three antibiotics.",

(2010) reported the potential antiviral activity of LAB using animal and human intestinal, and macrophage cell line models of non-tumor origin, and the various strains tested were found to exhibit moderate to complete monolayer protection against viral RV or TGEV disruption; the highest protection effects being recorded with the known probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus casei Shirota against both RV and TGEV. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported antiviral activity of L. plantarum and L. salivarius strains against TGE coronavirus.",

            "text": "An ideal probiotic bacterium must survive the harsh environments in the stomach having low pH and in the intestinal tract containing bile acids. Because of the bile tolerance, both the strains can grow and survive in the upper small intestine, where bile salt hydrolase activity of such lactobacilli may play a role in the enterohepatic cycle (De smet et al. 1995) . The broad antimicrobial activities exhibited by both the strains are beneficial for the maintenance of intestinal microflora, which is one of the important properties expected from probiotic bacteria. Pascual et al. (1999) reported the great capability of L. salivarius CTC2197 to reduce S. enteritidis C-114 colonization in vivo, together with its ability to colonize the gastrointestinal tract of chicken after a single inclusion in the feed mixture. Angelis et al. (2006) selected many potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces to be used as additives in pelleted feeding. L. plantarum have been reported to possess excellent probiotic properties (Cebeci and Gurakan 2003) , and Wullt et al. (2003) reported L. plantarum 299v for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficileassociated diarrhea. In the genus Lactobacillus, several bacteriocins have been partially purified and characterized from strains of L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus brevis, L. casei, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus helveticus, L. plantarum, and Lactobacillus sakae (Klaenhammer 1993) . Corr et al. (2007) reported that L. salivarius UCC118 tractable probiotic strain of human origin produces a bacteriocin in vivo that can significantly protect mice against infection with the invasive food borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. Further studies are required to determine on the bacteriocin production by the present strains to differentiate them from other bacteriocins described previously. Antibiotic resistance has become a serious problem in treatment of infections caused by a variety of microorganisms due to the indiscriminate use of antibiotica in human and veterinary medicine, as well as in animal growth promoters (Mattila-Sandholm et al. 1999) . The present results suggest that both the strains, as probiotics, could be able to colonize in the gastrointestinal tract in spite of antibiotic treatments. Probiotic feeding may represent an important antibiotic alternative therapy for animal and human subjects to prevent the enteropathogen infections. This is particularly important in the case of piglets, where the large use of antibiotics to prevent their frequent intestinal infections may have serious consequences on human health, due to the possible presence of antibioticresistant bacteria in pig food products and in animal wastecontaminated environments (Smith et al. 2002) . The results of the present study indicates that both the isolated strains Probio-38 and 37 with their pH and bile tolerance, activity against enteric pathogens, and TGE coronavirus and with antibiotic resistance are ideal probiotic candidates for animal application after the proper in vivo experiments.",
