In the case of health care providers, we have the added responsibility for the safety of our patients, staff members and families. In the past 30 years, we have responded to a litany of diseases and organisms with exotic names, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV); human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); hantavirus; Lyme disease; variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and prion diseases; severe acute respiratory syndrome/coronavirus; avian influenza (bird flu); West Nile virus; human papilloma virus; Escherichia coli O157:H7; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; and, of most recent concern, 2009 H1N1 influenza. There also are potential threats from deliberate exposures with uncommonly seen yet virulent agents such as anthrax, plague, tularemia and viral hemorrhagic fevers. In these circumstances, it is almost impossible for a clinician to stay fully informed about the variety of signs, symptoms, routes of transmission, virulence and other important factors related to risk of transmission.",

            "text": "It is worth noting that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently posted regulatory controls that health care employers should be using to protect workers from exposure to the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus. 2 These general principles are intended to follow CDC guidance. In addition, CDC 3 recently posted specific guidance for dental health care: dEncourage all dental health care personnel to receive vaccinations for seasonal influenza and 2009 H1N1 influenza. dUse patient-reminder calls to identify patients reporting influenzalike illness and resched-ule nonurgent visits until after the patient is free of fever for 24 hours without the use of feverreducing medicine. dIdentify patients with influenzalike illness at check-in; offer a face mask or tissues to symptomatic patients; follow respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette 4 and reschedule appointments for patients needing nonurgent care; separate ill patients from others whenever possible if evaluating for urgent care. dUrgent dental treatment can be performed without the use of an airborne infection isolation room because transmission of 2009 H1N1 influenza is thought not to occur across longer distances through the air, such as from one patient room to another. dUse a treatment room with a closed door, if available. If not, use one that is farthest from other patients and personnel. dWear recommended personal protective equipment before entering the treatment room. dDental health care personnel should wear a disposable N95 respirator fit-tested by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health when entering the operatory and when performing dental procedures in patients with suspected or confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza. dIf N95 respirators and/or fit testing is not available despite reasonable attempts to obtain them, non-fit-tested disposable N95 respirators or surgical face masks can be considered as a lower level of protection for personnel at lower risk of exposure or lower risk of experiencing complications resulting from influenza until fit-tested N95 respirators are available. dMinimize spray and spatter should be treated as infectious. These were designed to prevent transmission of HIV, HBV and other bloodborne pathogens in all health care settings. In 1996, CDC expanded this guidance into \"Standard Precautions,\" a standard of care designed to protect health care personnel and patients from pathogens that can be spread by blood or any other bodily fluid, excretion or secretion. Standard Precautions are the foundation of a comprehensive infection control program and include a group of infection control practices that apply to all patients, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection status, in any setting in which health care is delivered, including dental settings.",

Exposure to 2009 H1N1 influenza virus occurs in household, community and occupational settings, and transmission is thought to occur through droplet exposure of mucosal surfaces; through indirect contact, usually via the hands, with respiratory secretions from an infectious patient or contaminated surface; and through inhalation of small-particle aerosols in the vicinity of the infectious person. In theory, any measure that limits the dispersal of respiratory droplets should reduce the opportunity for transmission. An important element added to Standard Precautions in 2007 was respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette. 1 Basic principles of this etiquette include the following: dEducate staff members, patients and visitors regarding the importance of containing respiratory secretions to help prevent the transmission of influenza and other respiratory In theory, any measure that limits the dispersal of respiratory droplets should reduce the opportunity for transmission of infection. when possible (for example, use a dental dam and a high-volume evacuator).",
