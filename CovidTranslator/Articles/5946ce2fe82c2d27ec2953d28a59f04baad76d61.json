Apgar scores were 9 both at 1 and 5 min. The mother did not have significant past medical history of respiratory infection for last one month. She did not recall any contacts with ill individuals and denied recent travel. Mother and baby were discharged from hospital on next day of delivery. Baby was looked after by his mother and was exclusive breast fed up to day 4. However, mother developed severe dehydrating diarrhea and admitted to another hospital on day 5. Baby was at home and developed fever, occasional cough and vomiting on that day. Baby became lethargic and developed respiratory distress on day 6 for which he was admitted to the hospital on day 7. On physical examination, the baby was weighed 1 800 g and had high grade of fever (39 \u66df ) with respiratory distress. Respiratory rate was 66/min and respiration was mainly Horizontal transmission of H1N1/09 virus infection is very common however; transmission through this route has not been reported in newborns. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of newborn who acquired infection of novel H1N1/09 virus horizontally through asymptomatic family members or hospital staff during epidemic period in Kolkata, India. Baby recovered without antiviral therapy but received antibiotic for bacterial co-infection.",

Extraction of viral RNA from the clinical samples was carried out using commercially available QiaAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Onestep Real-time RT-PCR assay was performed using TaqMan Influenza Assay Kit (Part No. 4401512, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) and AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Part No.4387391, Ambion, Austin, USA) for diagnosis of pandemic H1N1. Each sample was subjected to four reactions testing for influenza A matrix (M) gene, pandemic H1N1 nucleoprotein (NP), pandemic H1N1 hemagglutinin (HA1) gene and human gene RNase P as an internal control [6] . After receiving positive result of H1N1/09 of the baby, nasopharyngeal swabs of both the parents and grandparents were also examined which were negative for H1N1/09. The baby was put on intravenous antibiotics (cefotaxim and amikacin) empirically. Fluid and electrolyte balance was maintained intravenously and subsequently by nesogastic feeding till the baby became breast fed. Baby was on supportive therapy with moist oxygen supplementation and paracetamol. However, temperature continued till day 14 but repeat examination of nasopharyngeal swab showed elimination of pandemic H1N1/09. Due to continued fever, blood sample was collected aseptically to detect bacterial pathogen on day 15 using standard technique. Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) was grown in blood culture after 24 h of incubation. The antimicrobial susceptibility of this isolate was determined by Kirby Bauer's disc diffusion method using a panel of commercially available discs (Beckton Dickenson, MD, USA). Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) of the antibiotics for this isolate were determined by E-test strips (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) according to manufacturer's recommendations. E. coli ATCC 25922 was used as a reference strain for quality control checking. Results were interpreted as per Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute guidelines [7] . The isolate was susceptible to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, amikacin, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, imipenem and meropenem but resistant to the following antimicrobials with their MICs: ampicillin (>256 \u6bfa L/mL), piperacillin (>256 \u6bfa L/mL), co-trimoxazole (>32 \u6bfa L/mL), cefotaxime (>256 \u6bfa L/mL), ceftazidime (>256 \u6bfa L/mL), ceftriaxone (>256 \u6bfa L/mL), cefpodoxime (>256 \u6bfa L/mL), cefipime (>256 \u6bfa L/mL), cefixime (>256 \u6bfa L/mL), azithromycin (>256 \u6bfa L/mL), aztreonam (>256 \u6bfa L/mL). The isolate was shown to be positive for Extended Spectrum of Beta Lactamase (ESBL) by phenotypic test. We changed the antibiotics to meropenum (60 mg/kg/d in three divided doses) on day 18 as the isolates of K. pneumonia was susceptible to that drug and continued for 12 d. No antiviral drug was given. On day 23, baby became afebrile and respiratory distress subsided without any complication. Baby was stable, had breast milk and gained weight during hospital stay. Baby was discharged from the hospital on day 30. The baby was also doing well during subsequent follow up visit at the age of two months.",

However, mother developed severe dehydrating diarrhea in later half of postnatal period but her nasopharyngeal swab was negative for H1N1/09 which negated the possibility of H1N1/09 related diarrhea in mother and possibility of transmission of infection to the baby. During pandemic, a good proportion of pediatric inpatients were positive for H1N1/09 in USA but none was in neonatal age group [12] . Neonates suffering from respiratory infection were screened for H1N1/09 infection during the epidemic period in Hong Kong which showed that H1N1/09 did not appear to be the prevalent respiratory virus in neonates [8] .",
