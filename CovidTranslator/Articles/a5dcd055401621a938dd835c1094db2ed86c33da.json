            "text": "A number of techniques are available for detection and characterization of influenza viruses and RSV including conventional methods such as cell culture, enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and immunofluorescence (IF) . Recent advances in molecular techniques enable detection of pathogens based on the nucleic acid sequences of genetic material isolated from viruses or bacteria in clinical specimens. Notably, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular methods have been used widely and are well accepted for laboratory diagnosis of pathogens due to their rapidity, sensitivity and high throughput capability (Fredricks and Relman, 1999; Louie et al., 2000; Weinberg et al., 2002; Yang and Rothman, 2004) . In the past few years, several multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) methods have been developed for the detection of influenza viruses, RSV and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), etc. (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Coiras et al., 2003; Grondahl et al., 1999; Stockton et al., 1998; Syrmis et al., 2004) . In these methods, analysis of PCR products relies either on agarose gel electrophoresis or more time-consuming enzyme-linked assays and many of them include a nested PCR step to enhance sensitivity. However, none of the published methods provide quantitative results. More recently, real-time RT-PCR assays for detecting influenza and RSV have been developed and used successfully in testing clinical specimens (Boivin et al., 2004) .",

The primers for influenza A viruses were selected from the nucleotide sequences encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) gene as follows: for A/H1 subtype, 5 -atgcagacacaatatgtataggc-3 (HA1-forward [F]) and 5 -gatactgagctcaattgctc-3 (HA1-reverse [R]); for A/H3 subtype, 5 -gagctggttcagagttcctc-3 (HA3-F) and 5 -gtgacctaagggaggcataatc-3 (HA3-R). The primers for influenza B viruses were selected from the nucleotide sequences encoding the nucleoprotein (NP) gene as follows: 5 -gaagtaggtggagacggaggg-3 (NP-F) and 5 -gtaaacacccacattccaaacg-3 (NP-R). The primers for RSV were selected from the nucleotide sequences encoding the nucleocapsid protein (NP) gene as follows: for RSV-A, 5 -cagaggtacaccgaggaatcaa-3 (RSVANP-F) and 5 -gctgatgtttgatagcctct-3 (RSVANP-R); for RSV-B, 5 -tagaggtacgccaagaaaccag-3 (RSVBNP-F) and 5 -gttgattctttatggcttcc-3 (RSVBNP-R). The PCR assay was evaluated by testing primer pairs against various laboratory virus stocks. Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from 70 l influenza and RSV virus stocks or respiratory specimens using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Viral particle counts were determined by electron microscopy (Advanced Biotechnologies Inc., Columbia, MD) as previously described (Hu et al., 2003) . Multiplex RT-PCR was carried out in a 9600 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) using the Titan One Tube RT-PCR kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) in a total volume of 50 l with 5 l RNA and 2 l master primer mix. The master primer mix comprised 75 l A/H1, 50 l A/H3, 60 l B, 50 l RSV-A and 50 l RSV-B primers (including both forward and reverse sequences). All stock primer concentrations were 160 ng/ml. The PCR program was 48 \u2022 C for 15 min, 52 \u2022 C for 30 min and 94 \u2022 C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 \u2022 C for 1 min, 60 \u2022 C for 30 s and 68 \u2022 C for 1 min. Final extension was carried out at 68 \u2022 C for 5 min. The amplification products were analyzed by DNA 500 LabChip using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, 1 l PCR reaction was loaded into one of 12 sample wells on a LabChip containing 5 l DNA 500 Markers and run for 30 min under appropriate settings.",

            "text": "This mRT-PCR assay was utilized to evaluate 56 nasal swab specimens obtained from Asian children (6-36 months old) with respiratory symptoms, who were enrolled in an experimental influenza vaccine trial conducted in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and India during the winter of 2000 and 2001. Among these specimens, the mRT-PCR detected 10 influenza A/H1, 6 influenza A/H3, 8 influenza B positive and 1 RSV (A/B) positive sample (Table 1) , whereas culture confirmation identified 14 influenza A and 7 influenza B positive samples. No RSV culture was performed for these specimens. The PCR detected all culture-positive specimens with the additional benefit of distinguishing A/H1 and A/H3 subtypes. In addition, three culturenegative samples tested positive by the mRT-PCR method, one each from influenza A/H1, A/H3 and B groups, respectively. Despite the relatively small sample size, we further validated the results using a real-time RT-PCR assay performed on the same specimens. The results confirmed all the PCR positives and showed that compared with the culture-positive specimens, the three culture-negative specimens that were positive by PCR contained relatively low copy numbers of the viruses, ranging from 22 to 721 copies per reaction (data not shown). Respiratory viruses are conventionally diagnosed based on cell culture or antigen detection such as EIA and IF, which can be time-consuming or have limitations in sensitivity and specificity. Although real-time PCR may have higher sensitivity than conventional PCR, the latter is usually more economical for clinical laboratories that are not equipped with expensive realtime PCR instruments. In addition, the optimal of multiplicity for real-time PCR is currently limited to three due to a limited number of fluorophores (S. Cheng, unpublished). The method reported in this study, which primarily targets influenza A/H3, A/H1 and B viruses and RSV A and B, is carried out in a singlestep reaction with minimal opportunity for contamination since no secondary or tertiary nested PCR is needed as in previous methods (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Coiras et al., 2003; Grondahl et al., 1999; Stockton et al., 1998) . The PCR amplicons in this method range from 133 to 390 bp, which are relatively small in size that can increase the assay sensitivities. For analyzing PCR products, the DNA LabChip platform of Agilent Technologies was utilized to replace conventional agarose gel electrophoresis or more time-consuming enzyme-linked hybridization assays. The LabChip assay not only consumes smaller sample volumes (1 l per reaction) but also enhances sensitivity to as low as 0.5 ng/ l DNA. The LabChip provides unambiguous, consistent and semi-quantitative results, which permits ease of quality control and quantity estimation for any downstream analysis, such as DNA sequencing for strain determination. It also provides information such as relative abundance of viruses in the case of mixed infections. Our results showed that the mRT-PCR assay could easily detect specimens containing low virus copy numbers as well as cases of virus co-infection (e.g. 2 cases of A/H1 and A/H3 and 2 instances of A/H1 and B), which were not detected by culture confirmation. One of the limitation of this method is that the size of the PCR products for RSV A and B are not distinguishable; however, a separate assay designed to address this limitation was developed later (Hu et al., 2003) .",

The assay can be easily performed by local laboratories for determination of the causative viral agent(s) of respiratory illness during suspected outbreaks of newly emerging pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, and potential avian flu H5N1 virus, by eliminating common viral pathogens, thus facilitating local disease management and global surveillance.",
