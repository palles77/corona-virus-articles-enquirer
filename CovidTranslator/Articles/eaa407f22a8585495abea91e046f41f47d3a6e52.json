            "text": "RNA interference, mediated by short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), has been shown to have activity against a wide range of viruses and is a promising new antiviral therapy. Using multiple siRNAs that target conserved areas of the genome allows for increased chances of antiviral activity against different viral strains and also helps to prevent the emergence of escape mutants. In this study, four siRNAs were designed to target areas of conserved sequence between divergent strains of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV). A pool of these siRNAs inhibited the replication of all six strains of VEEV tested. A single nucleotide mismatch at the extreme 3 end of one of the siRNA sense strands did not affect antiviral activity but other mutations were not tolerated. Two strains of VEEV were tested for their abilities to overcome the inhibitory effects of RNA interference following 10 consecutive incubations in the presence of siRNAs. One strain remained susceptible throughout the course of the experiment but the other strain became resistant to the activity of siRNAs. Sequence analysis of the siRNA target sites in this strain showed that no mutations had been generated, indicating that the virus may had become resistant in some other manner. In the absence of effective antiviral drugs and vaccines to combat VEEV infection, these siRNAs offer a potential new therapeutic approach but, as with all antimicrobial agents, caution needs to be exercised with respect to the generation of resistance.

The genome is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of approximately 11.4 kb, capped at the 5 end and polyadenylated at the 3 end. The 5 two-thirds of the genome encodes for four nonstructural proteins (nsp1-nsp4) which are required for RNA replication. The subgenomic (26S) messenger RNA, equivalent to the 3 one-third of the genome, encodes for three structural proteins (capsid, E1 and E2) and two small cleavage products (E3 and 6K) (Strauss and Strauss, 1994) . On infection, the non-structural proteins are translated directly from the genomic RNA, which also acts as a template for the synthesis of the negative-sense strand. The negative-sense strand then provides the template for the synthesis of both genomic and subgenomic RNA (Strauss and Strauss, 1994) . The release of * Tel.: +44 1980 614947; fax: +44 1980 613284.

RNA interference is an evolutionary conserved mechanism within eukaryotes and its functions include endogenous gene regulation, viral defence and the maintenance of genomic stability (Fountaine et al., 2005) . It has yet to be proven that mammals use RNA interference as a viral defence mechanism but in the laboratory, the introduction of siRNAs into mammalian cells can be used to inhibit the expression of viral genes. RNA interference has been shown to be active against many human pathogenic viruses (Geisbert et al., 2006; Reuter et al., 2006; Tan and Yin, 2004) , including the alphaviruses Semliki Forest virus (Caplen et al., 2002) and O'nyong-nyong virus (Keene et al., 2004) . The efficient and sequence-specific nature of RNA interference has raised the possibility of using siRNAs as an antiviral therapy. Here, the ability of a pool of four siRNAs to specifically inhibit the replication of six human pathogenic strains of VEEV is described.",

As RNA viruses have high mutation rates, there is a strong probability of VEEV escaping the inhibitory effects of RNA interference by introducing mutations in the siRNA target sites. To determine the ability of VEEV to overcome RNA interference, strains TrD and BeAn8 were subjected to 10 consecutive incubations in the presence of siRNA 2, Lamin A/C siRNA, the pool of non-targeting siRNAs or the VEEV siRNA pool (Fig. 8) . Individual siRNAs were used to test whether resistant mutations arose more readily in the presence of single siRNAs compared to pools of siRNAs. However, in the case of VEEV strain TrD, resistance to the siRNA pool was observed after four exposures, whilst resistance to siRNA 2 alone was observed after seven exposures ( Fig. 8A and B) . In contrast, VEEV strain BeAn8 remained susceptible to either the individual siRNA or the pool of siRNAs throughout the experiment ( Fig. 8C and D) .",

As the only siRNA to inhibit strain BeAn8 replication, siRNA 2 is responsible for the activity of the VEEV siRNA pool against this virus. Additional siRNAs could be designed against strain BeAn8 (and Mena II) for inclusion in the siRNA pool. All the individual siRNAs found within the pool inhibit the replication of VEEV strain TrD, although siRNA 3 was on average the least effective. Huesken et al. (2005) have recently described preferences for nucleotides at certain positions in the anti-sense strand of active siRNAs. siRNAs 1 and 2 have four of the preferred bases (at positions 7, 10, 17 and 19 and positions 2, 10, 17 and 19, respectively) and siRNA 4 has three of the preferred nucleotides (at positions 1, 2 and 19). However, in siRNA3, only one of the base preferences is present (at position 17), perhaps explaining it's lack of effectiveness compared to the other siRNAs. Combining the four siRNAs did not cause a large increase in antiviral activity against strain TrD and this is in accordance with the results of others (Schubert et al., 2005; Yuan et al., 2005) . It can be envisaged that using multiple siRNAs may lead to a saturation of RISC, thereby reducing the incorporation of individual siRNAs into the complex and decreasing their activity. However, this does not appear to have taken place with the VEEV siRNA pool.",

However, the evidence to date indicates that short synthetic siRNA duplexes can only be detected by TLR7 (located in the endosomal membrane of immune cells such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells) and recognition requires the presence of specific motifs (Hornung et al., 2005; Judge et al., 2005) .

            "text": "Long-term silencing of viral protein expression by siRNAs has been reported to result in the emergence of viruses resistant to RNA interference (Das et al., 2004; Gitlin et al., 2005) , an issue that will need to be addressed if siRNAs are to be used therapeutically. Resistance was caused by the generation of mutations in the siRNA target site. This problem is particularly relevant for RNA viruses that exhibit increased genetic variation due to error-prone replication. To ensure siRNAs remained effective, viral RNA sequences that are conserved, and normally invariant between different strains, have been targeted (Chang et al., 2005; Dave and Pomerantz, 2004) or several viral sequences have been simultaneously targeted (Chang et al., 2005; Geisbert et al., 2006; Gitlin et al., 2005) . The work described here utilizes both these approaches and it was successful against VEEV strain BeAn8 but resistance to RNA interference was observed with strain TrD. The mechanism of siRNA resistance in strain TrD is uncertain. Mutations did not occur in the siRNA target sites, indicating that escape mutants do not readily arise when these particular conserved areas of sequence are targeted. Silent mutations, which alter the nucleotide sequence but do not affect the encoded amino acid, have the potential to prevent recog-nition of the target RNA by the siRNA but even these did not occur. A number of mammalian viruses have been shown to express proteins that function as suppressors of RNA interference (for reviews see Kok and Jin, 2006; Zheng et al., 2005) . These viral proteins bind double stranded RNA and are able to protect messenger RNA from degradation by sequestering siR-NAs and preventing the formation of an active RISC. The capsid protein of VEEV contains regions that bind specifically to RNA (Strauss and Strauss, 1994) . Mutations may have occurred in this protein that led to an increased ability to sequester siRNA and therefore an increased resistance to RNA interference. It has been reported that an additional mechanism for suppressing RNA interference is the production of RNAs that subvert host cell functions, including the inhibition of the RNA interference pathway (for a review see Sarnow et al., 2006) . However, this type of RNA has so far only been found in viruses with DNA genomes making this an unlikely explanation for siRNA resistance in VEEV.",

The high level of viral inhibition induced by the VEEV siRNA pool suggests that the siRNAs may be active in vivo and this is currently being examined. Although the level of inhibition induced by the siRNA pool was substantial, the transient nature of the inhibition suggests that a single administration of siRNAs could not be used to cure VEEV infection. Using multiple doses of siRNAs should be avoided as it risks inducing viral resistance. However, the temporary inhibition of viral replication may allow the infected host enough time to develop an immune response capable of overcoming VEEV. Alternatively, siRNAs could be used therapeutically in combination with other antiviral compounds to successfully treat the infection. With a disease such as VEEV, it may be necessary to deliver siRNAs to the brains of infected individuals. Direct injection of siRNAs into the brain has been effectively used to target a wide range of genes (Fountaine et al., 2005) but ideally siRNAs would be administered systemically and then be able to cross the blood-brain barrier. It has been shown that intravenous injections of pegylated immunoliposomes connected to targeting monoclonal antibodies are able to deliver siRNAs across the blood-brain barrier to successfully treat intracranial brain cancer (Zhang et al., 2004) . Alternatively, it may be possible to link siRNAs to appropriate lipid molecules for delivery across the blood-brain barrier. This approach was shown to be effective at delivering cholesterol-conjugated siR-NAs to the liver and jejunum (Soutschek et al., 2004) .",
