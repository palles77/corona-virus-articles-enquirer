            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infects ciliated epithelial cells in the chicken respiratory tract. While some IBV strains replicate locally, others can disseminate to various organs, including the kidney. Here, we elucidate the determinants for kidney tropism by studying interactions between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral attachment protein spike from two IBV strains with different tropisms. Recombinantly produced RBDs from the nephropathogenic IBV strain QX and from the nonnephropathogenic strain M41 bound to the epithelial cells of the trachea. In contrast, only QX-RBD binds more extensively to cells of the digestive tract, urogenital tract, and kidneys. While removal of sialic acids from tissues prevented binding of all proteins to all tissues, binding of QX-RBD to trachea and kidney could not be blocked by preincubation with synthetic alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids. The lack of binding of QX-RBD to a previously identified IBV-M41 receptor was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), demonstrating that tissue binding of QX-RBD is dependent on a different sialylated glycan receptor. Using chimeric RBD proteins, we discovered that the region encompassing amino acids 99 to 159 of QX-RBD was required to establish kidney binding. In particular, QX-RBD amino acids 110 to 112 (KIP) were sufficient to render IBV-M41 with the ability to bind to kidney, while the reciprocal mutations in IBV-QX abolished kidney binding completely. Structural analysis of both RBDs suggests that the receptor-binding site for QX is located at a different location on the spike than that of M41. IMPORTANCE Infectious bronchitis virus is the causative agent of infectious bronchitis in chickens. Upon infection of chicken flocks, the poultry industry faces substantial economic losses by diminished egg quality and increased morbidity and mortality of infected animals. While all IBV strains infect the chicken respiratory tract via the ciliated epithelial layer of the trachea, some strains can also replicate in the kidneys, dividing IBV into the following two pathotypes: nonnephropathogenic (example, IBV-M41) and nephropathogenic viruses (including IBV-QX). Here, we set out to identify the determinants for the extended nephropathogenic tropism of IBV-QX. Our data reveal that each pathotype makes use of a different sialylated glycan ligand, with binding sites on opposite sides of the attachment protein. This knowledge should facilitate the design of antivirals to prevent coronavirus infections in the field.",

            "text": "Binding to host tissues is the first step in the viral life cycle of IBV and therefore a critical factor in determining tissue tropism. Tissue tropism differs based on the amino acid composition of the spike protein as shown by recombinantly produced proteins (15) (16) (17) and infection assays with recombinant viruses (18) . The spike of IBV is posttranslationally cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2, where S2 is anchored in the virus membrane and important for membrane fusion. S1 comprises the head domain of spike and is responsible for host receptor binding (19) . Using recombinantly expressed M41-S1 proteins, alpha-2,3linked sialic acids were identified as the IBV receptor on a glycan array, where specific binding to the ligand Neu5Ac\u24232-3Gal\u24241-3GlcNAc was observed (19) . Recently the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the M41 spike has been resolved (20) , indicating that the S1 subunit consists of two independent folding domains, the N-terminal domain (NTD) (amino acids 21 to 237) and C-terminal domain (CTD) (amino acids 269 to 414), with a proposed receptor-binding site in both domains. Experimental evidence using recombinantly expressed spike domains has indicated that amino acids 19 to 272 of the M41 spike are sufficient for binding to trachea as well as binding to alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids (15) . This domain thus contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and can be used to study the biological implications of genetic variation in circulating IBV genotypes.",

Each protein was assessed for binding using trachea and kidney tissue slides. Binding to trachea tissue was observed using M41-ED, S1, and RBD but not CTD to ciliated epithelium of the trachea, specifically located at the base of the cilia (Fig. 1) , confirming previous observations (15, 19, 21) . None of the proteins bound kidney tissue, which is shown by a representative picture using M41-RBD (Fig. 1B) . Binding affinity to the known ligand (Neu5Ac\u24232-3Gal\u24241-3GlcNAc) in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was observed using M41-RBD, M41-S1, and M41-ED, not significantly different when compared to each other but significantly higher compared to those of M41-CTD and turkey coronavirus (TCoV)-S1 (Fig. 1C) . These results indicate that ligand binding of M41-RBD is not significantly different compared to that of M41-S1 and M41-ED, suggesting no additional ligand-binding motifs are present in S1 and ED; thus, in the remaining experiments, we used M41-RBD, as the tissue tropism of the virus is reflected using this recombinant protein.",

To this end, we allowed both proteins to bind to tissue microarray slides containing 28 different chicken tissues (24) . Binding of M41-RBD was primarily found on the ciliated lining of the epithelium of the proximal and distal trachea ( Fig. 1 ), but additional staining was observed in the epithelial lining of the colon, cecal tonsil, ureter, oviduct, and conjunctiva (Table 1) . QX-RBD bound to the same tissues as M41-RBD, but additional binding was observed in gizzard, ileum, and cloaca of the digestive tract, as well as liver and kidneys (Table 1 and Fig. 2D ), reflecting that observed in vivo for replication of both genotypes. Detailed analysis of staining present in the kidney showed that binding of QX-RBD was restricted to the parietal epithelium of Bowman's capsule in the glomerulus (Fig. 2D) . No binding to the glomeruli was observed when using M41-RBD in three independent experiments using different protein batches. Taken together, QX-RBD shows a markedly broader binding profile than that of M41-RBD, which is in line with the reported broader tissue tropism in vivo (2). QX-RBD binds to sialic acids on chicken tissues. To investigate whether the expanded tropism of QX-RBD can be explained by binding with similar specificity, but higher affinity, to the previously identified M41 receptor (19) , we preincubated both RBD proteins with the synthetic Neu5Ac\u24232-3Gal\u24241-3GlcNAc before applying them to trachea and kidney tissue slides. As expected, binding of M41-RBD to the trachea was completely prevented (Fig. 3A , middle column) in the presence of the synthetic M41 ligand. In contrast, QX-RBD still showed strong binding to the ciliated epithelium of the trachea and glomeruli of the kidney. To confirm the loss of binding of QX-RBD to Neu5Ac\u24232-3Gal\u24241-3GlcNAc, a solid-phase ELISA was performed, in which Neu5Ac\u24232-3Gal\u24241-3GlcNAc was coated.

TCoV-S1 was used as a negative control in equal molar amounts. ELISA was performed in triplicate with all proteins; average is shown with standard deviations. expected, no binding of QX-RBD to this particular glycan was observed at any of the protein concentrations, which is comparable to that of the negative control TCoV-S1 (only binding longer branched galactose-terminated glycans [25] ), while M41-RBD bound to Neu5Ac\u24232-3Gal\u24241-3GlcNAc in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3B) .",

Chimeric RBD proteins were generated by dividing each wild-type RBD into three domains and mixing them to get six different combinations (schematic representations in Fig. 4A ). These chimeras were then applied to trachea and kidney tissue slides. (Fig. 4B) . Like wild-type RBDs, binding of all chimeric proteins was dependent on the presence of sialic acids, as pretreatment of host tissues with AUNA abrogated binding (data not shown). M-M-Q, Q-M-M, and Q-M-Q proteins had reduced affinity for Neu5Ac\u24232-3Gal\u24241-3GlcNAc (Fig. 4C) , potentially explaining the reduced staining of these proteins to trachea tissue (Fig. 4B) . None of the RBD proteins containing the middle QX sequence (Q-Q-M, M-Q-Q, and M-Q-M) had affinity for this glycan in the ELISA as expected based on tissue staining ( Fig. 4B and C) , which is in line with the hypothesis these proteins are dependent on binding to the QX receptor instead of the known M41 receptor.

In the ELISA, both M41-SGS and M41-KIP demonstrated a decreased affinity for alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids compared to that of M41-RBD, while introduction of both triplets SGS and KIP (M41-SGS-KIP) completely abolished binding to this glycan (Fig. 5C ). Taken together, these results suggest that a receptor-binding site critical to establish kidney binding requires amino acids KIP at position 107 to 109 in M41-RBD.",

Finally, we modelled QX-RBD based on a structural overlay with the recently resolved cryo-EM structure of the M41 spike (20) and focused on the amino acids allowing kidney binding. The overall structure of both proteins is comparable (Fig. 6A , green ribbon, M41; blue ribbon, QX); however, the loop consisting of HVR 2 is slightly larger in QX-RBD as expected, as there are two additional amino acids present (Fig. 6A, SGS100 -102 for QX-RBD versus Y99 in M41-RBD). Interestingly, this loop was predicted to be involved in sugar binding (20) , which we showed to be true for QX-RBD but not for M41-RBD. In detail, the tyrosine (Y99) in the M41 structure (Fig. 6A , beige) occupies more space than serine (S in QX) and can be seen reaching toward a neighboring loop. Furthermore, the 110 -112KIP sequence identified in QX-RBD (Fig. 6A , dark blue) places a positive charge at the protein surface, which is not present in 107-109MLQ in M41-RBD (Fig. 6A, light blue) . Previous in silico docking analysis performed with potential alpha-2,3-linked ligands to the M41-RBD protein identified amino acids S87, N144, and T162 to potentially be involved in receptor binding (17) . When we highlighted these amino acids predicted to be involved in binding to alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids (Fig. 6B, red spheres) the different ligands recognized by M41 and QX are on different sides of the protein (Fig.  6B) . Furthermore, when these amino acids were highlighted in the full cryo-EM resolved structures of M41 (Fig. 6C) and QX (Fig. 6D) , it clearly shows that the potential ligandbinding site of M41 is at a different location compared to the QX ligand-binding site ( Fig.  6C and D) .",

Unfortunately, no binding was observed using our RBD proteins. This may be explained by the usage of RBD proteins instead of the full S1, as used previously (19) , or by the composition and fine structure of the glycans present in both arrays. On the arrays used, most glycans contain the linkage found in mammals (Gal\u24241,4GlcNAc), while the minority contain a Gal\u24241,3GlcNAc linkage.

Sequence alignment of this amino acid triplicate (100 to 102 in QX-RBD) varies in nephropathogenic IBV genotypes from SGS/SGT for clade GI-19 (IBV-QX), NQQ/SQQ for clade GI-13 (IBV-793B), and SGA for clade GI-14 (IBV-B1648) at that position.

Previous in silico predictions of the interaction with alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid ligands in M41-RBD pointed toward three amino acids, S87, N144, and T162, which are in close proximity to four essential N-glycosylation sites (N33, N59, N85, and N160) (17) . Although the amino acid sequence of S87, N144, and T162 is conserved between M41 and QX, one of the essential N-glycosylation sites is at a different position (N59 in M41 and N58 in QX). This may result in a different conformation of the ligand-binding site, thereby preventing QX-RBD wild-type binding to the M41 ligand, which was supported by experimental evidence using the chimeric M41-RBD protein where this glycosylation site was replaced, resulting in loss of binding to trachea tissue (data not shown). Furthermore, in the publication where the cryo-EM structure of M41 was resolved, the loop consisting of amino acids present in HVR 2 of the spike was proposed to be required for receptor binding (20) . Our data points toward involvement of the unglycosylated loop containing HVR 2 for recognition of the QX glycan ligand but not the M41 ligand. Furthermore, the cryo-EM structure of the M41-CTD predicts other putative receptor-binding motif loops in M41 spike (20) . In Fig. 1 , we demonstrated that no binding to trachea and kidney tissue was observed using our recombinantly expressed M41-CTD, in contrast to their published results. As binding of QX-RBD reflects the tissue tropism of QX-infected birds, we speculate whether these loops (in the CTD) are necessary for initial receptor recognition and are involved in QX infection.",

The expression plasmids containing the codonoptimized M41-ED (amino acids 19 to 1091 [21] ), M41-S1 (amino acids 19 to 532 [19] ), M41-RBD (amino acids 19 to 272 [15] ), and M41-CTD (amino acids 273 to 532 [15] ; GenBank accession number AY851295) sequences followed by a trimerization domain (GCN4) and strep-tag (ST) were described previously (15) . The codon-optimized sequence of QX-RBD (amino acids 19 to 275; GenBank accession number AFJ11176), containing upstream NheI and downstream PacI restriction sites, was obtained from Gen-Script and cloned into the pCD5 expression vector by restriction digestion as previously described (19) . Fragments to generate chimeric RBD proteins were created by splice overlap extension PCR using the primers in Table 2 and cloned into the pJET vector (Thermo Scientific, USA). The sequences were verified by automated nucleotide sequencing (Macrogen, The Netherlands) before cloning each fragment into the pCD5 expression vector. Mutations up to 9 nucleotides (nt) were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the primers listed in Table 2 , and the sequences were subsequently verified by automated nucleotide sequencing (Macrogen, The Netherlands).",

In short, cells were transfected with pCD5 expression vectors using polyethylenimine (PEI) at a 1:12 (wt/wt) ratio. Cell culture supernatants were harvested after 6 days. The recombinant proteins were purified using Strep-Tactin Sepharose beads as previously described (19) .

Circular dichroism. Recombinant IBV RBD proteins were exchanged into buffer containing 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.75, and diluted to 0.06 mg/ml. CD spectra were collected on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter with a Peltier thermostatted fluorescence temperature controller module by accumulating 4 scans from 285 to 190 nm with a scanning speed of 10 nm/min, digital integrated time of 1 s, bandwidth of 1 nm, and standard sensitivity of 25\u00b0C. A thermal melt was done from 25\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C with a ramp rate of 1\u00b0C per minute. A full CD scan was collected at 95\u00b0C. After lowering the temperature to 25\u00b0C, the protein was allowed to refold for 20 min at 25\u00b0C, and a third CD scan was taken at 25\u00b0C to measure recovery. Secondary structure calculations for the CD data collected at 25\u00b0C before the thermal melt were processed by DichroWeb (23) using the CDSSTR (32), Selcon3 (33) , and ContiLL (34) algorithms with protein reference set 7. Results from the 3 algorithms were averaged and plotted in Fig. 2C .",
