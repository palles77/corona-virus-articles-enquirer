Viruses are nonliving entities that replicate only when they are inside host cells, often using the molecular machinery of the host genome to replicate. The viral genome consists of either ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which can be comprised of a single or double strand of either nucleic acid. Viral capsids are polyhedral structures composed of proteins that enclose the nucleic acid of the virus. Viruses can also have an envelope which is derived from phospholipids and proteins of the host cell membranes. Electron microscopy (EM) was once used as a method of identification and some viruses have a distinct morphology which will be discussed in their sections [1, 2] . This chapter discusses the following points which are necessary when diagnosing an infection and providing adequate antibiotic treatment:",

On one hand, a virus represents an inert biochemical complex of macromolecules, since it cannot replicate outside of a living cell. However, viruses are known to infect all living organisms. Indeed, a broad array of viruses contribute to manifestations of human disease. The extent of infection and related disease state depends upon the number of virions infecting the host, as well as specific host responses that contribute to associated manifestation of pathology. Diagnosis can be made by serology, growth in cell culture, cytopathic effect (CPE) including presence of intranuclear or intracytoplasmic inclusions and immunohistochemical staining of tissue biopsies or molecular methods.",

HSV-1 is typically associated with orolabial recurrence while genital recurrence is usually caused by HSV-2. However, genital infections caused by HSV-1 are becoming more common. Neonatal herpes can occur during vaginal delivery. Risk of infection is higher with mothers who have a primary infection. Disease can range from localized infection in the skin, eyes, and mucosa to manifestations that can at times occur as CNS or disseminated disease. HSV can cause central nervous system (CNS) disease in an immunocompromised host. HSV encephalitis can be fatal in about 70% of cases without therapy. With therapy this is reduced to about 20%. HSV meningitis is usually self-limiting and may be seen as sequelae to genital herpes. HSV meningitis may recur in up to 25% of cases after an asymptomatic period of months to years.",
