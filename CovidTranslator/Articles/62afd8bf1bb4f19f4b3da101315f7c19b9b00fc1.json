Briefly, exposure of the nasal mucosa to allergen in a sensitized individual leads to the release and further production of inflammatory mediators and the release of cyt~kines.~ These released cytokines activate endothelial cells, thereby inducing expression of adhesion receptors on the cell surface and initiating a cascade of events that facilitates transendothelial migration of inflammatory cells. T lymphocytes also are activated by these cytokines. Within a given tissue, specific patterns of cytokines are released, dependent on the dominant subset of local T lymphocytes.

            "text": "The basis of immune functional heterogeneity is the ability of T lymphocytes, in response to the protein antigens of microbes (or allergens or tumor cells), to differentiate into subsets of effector cells that produce distinct sets of cytokines2 and elicit distinct effector functions ( Fig. l ) . I Thus, specific populations of CD4' helper T lymphocytes (TH) can be distinguished on the basis of their secreted cytokines. According to the paradigm of Mosmann et a1,68 undifferentiated or naive T helper cells, THO cells, under appropriate conditions, may differentiate along distinct pathways to become either TH1 or TH2 lymphocytes. Which pathway is followed is determined by the type of stimulation (especially the local cellular and cytokine milieu produced at the time of antigen recognition). ' The major function for differentiated TH1 cells is regulation of cellmediated defense against tumor cells and infections, particularly defense against viral, fungal, mycobacterial, and intracellular pathogens. The most significant cytokine elaborated by differentiated TH1 cells is interferon-y (IFN-y). This cytokine stimulates microbicidal activities of phagocytes, increases class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule expression, activates neutrophils, stimulates cytolytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells, and activates vascular endothelial cells, thereby promoting T lymphocyte adhesion and extravasation. Importantly, IFN-y promotes CD4' T-cell differentiation to the T H 1 subtype and inhibits differentiation of TH2 cells, promoting T,1 dominance. Thus, the net effect of IFN-y production is the promotion of macrophage-rich inflammatory reactions, and inhibition of IgE-dependent, eosinophilmediated reactions. TH1 cells also produce interleukin-2 (IL-2), a cytokine known to stimulate proliferation and differentiation of CD8' T cells, aiding in the development of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) and produc- tion of lymphotoxin (LT), which promotes recruitment and activation of neutrophils and endothelial cells.",

            "text": "Conversely, cells of the TH2 subtype seem to function as physiologic regulators of immune responses, inhibiting potentially damaging TH1 responses. The major cytokines produced by activated TH2 cells are IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13. IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 mediate allergic reactions and the defense against helminthic infections; IL-4, IL-lo, and IL-13 antagonize the actions of IFN-y, thereby suppressing macrophage activation. IL-4 stimulates differentiation of antigen-stimulated T cells to the TH2 subset?l leading to an interesting conundrum; differentiated TH2 cells are the major source of IL-4, yet this cytokine is obligatory for TH2 differentiation. Current thinking suggests that antigen-stimulated T cells (including NK-T cells, 6y-T cells) and mast cells secrete small quantities of IL-4; in the context of persistent antigen stimulation, IL-4 concentrations locally increase. If the inflammation does not trigger IL-12 production, the result is increasing differentiation of the TH2 subset of T cells.82 Thus, the so-called key determinant of the TH2 profile may be persistent or repeated T-cell stimulation with little inflammation or macrophage activation. Other possible explanations include the production of IL-4 by other cell types or genetic factors that influence an individual's sensitivity to IL-4. Excessive or uncontrolled TH2 proliferation is associated with deficient cell-mediated immunity, particularly to infections by intracellular microbes (e.g., mycobacteria).' Support for this conceptual model of allergic inflammation can be found in several experimental observations. In an in vivo study, Linden et a158 challenged 10 allergic rhinitis subjects with birch pollen and 20 normal subjects with coronavirus. Ten of the 20 normal subjects inoculated developed upper respiratory infections (URIs). In contrast to patients with allergic rhinitis, subjects who developed URIs had increased levels of IFN-y (P < 0.05) in nasal lavage fluids that correlated with symptoms ( P < 0.001). These authors clearly showed that distinct cytokine profiles are expressed in viral URIs and allergic rhinitis, thereby supporting the concept that T,1 cytokines (especially IFN-y) are present in viral infection. Schwartz et als6 measured the T-cell cytokine response (IFN-y) in two adult patients who were mildly atopic but had extremely elevated IgE levels (4000-6000 IU/ mL). Compared with cells obtained from a control subject, the peripheral blood monocytes obtained from these patients and cultured in the presence of IFN-y were refractory to TH1 stimuli (IL-2, tetanus, phytohemaglutinin). The authors concluded that these elevated IgE levels represent an overly dominant T-cell commitment to the TH2 cytokine pattern, and speculated that such patients may have a defect in TH1 /TH2 regulation. Tavernier et alg3 attempted to discern whether the differences between atopic and nonatopic individuals were the result of proliferative responses of stimulated T cells or of the cytokine profile elicited by these cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 12 atopic and 10 nonatopic subjects were stimulated in vitro with house dust mite, cat, and dog allergens, and cell culture supernatants were assayed for IL-4, IL-5, and IFN-y. No differences in either Tcell proliferation or IFN-y levels were detected in the atopic versus nonatopic subjects. Significantly higher IL-5 levels, however, were detected among mite-sensitive subjects after stimulation with mite extract and in cat-sensitive subjects stimulated with cat extract. Similarly, IL-4 levels were significantly higher among cat-sensitive subjects stimulated with cat extract and dog-sensitive atopic subjects stimulated with dog extract. Such results point to differences in elicited cytokine profiles by stimulated T cells, rather than to differences in their ability to proliferate in response to allergen stimulation.",

Yabuhara showed that in atopic subjects, at least with respect to the inhalant allergen house dust mite, TH2 polarization probably is established in infancy and early childhood; by the time these subjects reached 2 years of age, the atopic (TH2) cytokine profile had become evident.'\" Further support comes from the finding that children with lower respiratory infections without wheezing have lower levels of IgE after, compared with before, their wheezing episodes, and higher levels of IFN-y. Such results suggest that lack of IFN-y may predispose to IgE production.62, 63, 71 This view is supported by recent investigations that documented significantly elevated IgE levels at the time of the first wheezing episode in subjects who went on to develop persistent wheezing symptoms, relative to levels found in patients who did not wheeze and nonatopic patients who wheezed.@ Similar relationships between infections and atopy were found in population studies among Japanese (tuberculosis) and West African (measles) childrens7, =; in each case, results prompted the investigators to speculate that by tipping the balance toward TH1 responses, early infection may confer protection from the development of atopy. This also may explain the greater prevalence of atopy and allergic disorders among single or older children than among younger siblings or among young children in day-care Stated another way, the improvements in control of infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, may help to explain recent rises in the prevalence of allergy and asthma in many countries worldwide.",

Thus, IL-4 acts to inhibit TH1 differentiation and to promote TH2 differentiation, and is a necessary signal for the latter.\" Interestingly, IL-4 does not have any selective growth effect on TH1 or TH2 cells when they have matured; once acquired, the pattern of cytokine production remains stable and is no longer influenced by the presence or absence of IL-4.2 In the context of asthmatic inflammation, IL-4 also seems to be crucial to the recruitment of TH2 cells to the lung20 and the migration of eosinophils from lung tissue into the airways. 21 In addition to its role in T-lymphocyte differentiation and cellmediated immune responses, a critical role for IL-4 in humoral immune responses has been well established (Box 1). IL-4, also known as B-cell stimulatory factor 1: 8 is the cytokine responsible for regulating the switch in immunoglobulin heavy chain isotype production (from IgGl to IgE) by B lymphocytes (Fig. 2) .

            "text": "For all of these reasons, IL-4 became an early focus for investigations of the role of cytokines in allergic responses. In 1988, Finkelman et a132 showed that IL-4 is critical to the generation and sustenance of IgE responses in vivo by demonstrating that early administration of large quantities of anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibodies were capable of inhibiting IgE responses, and that when these monoclonal antibodies were given at the peak of the response, declines in serum IgE were hastened. Based on their observations, the authors speculated that regulation of IL-4 production or activity may be an appropriate therapeutic target in allergic disorders. Subsequent studies in the mouse model and in humans have corroborated and expanded these observations, and numerous investigations have attempted to discern the mechanisms and molecular interrelationships that underlie these events. During antigen-specific T-B cell interactions, IL-4 released by the T cell binds to IL-4 receptors on the B cell, resulting in isotypic switching to IgE production. The binding of IL-4 to its receptor on resting B lymphocytes also induces the expression of another cell surface molecule, CD23, the low-affinity IgE receptor,27 which is postulated to be involved in regulation of IgE production. FccRI, the high-affinity IgE receptor is expressed on the surfaces of mast cells and basophils, and also is increased by IL-4. Binding of antigen to IgE molecules on these effector cells and subsequent cross-linking of the cell-bound IgE triggers degranulation and mediator release.\" IFN-?/ strongly inhibits CD23 induction by IL-4 as well as IL-4-dependent IgE prod~ction.~~, 70 In the context of allergic inflammation, IL-4 has several other effects (Fig. 3) : it directly upregulates the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) on the surfaces of vascular endothelial cells, which selectively promotes eosinophil adhesion and migration into 69, 85, 98 One report has suggested that the expression of a high-affinity IL-4 receptor on human lung fibroblasts may recruit and activate these cells and thereby induce the airway remodeling characteristic of asthma. associated with higher levels of expression of CD23 and enhanced signaling. Among a population of 50 adults, the R576 allele was found in 13 of 20 subjects with atopy, but only five of 30 nonatopic subjects (P = 0.001). Moreover, three of three patients with hyper-IgE syndrome and four of seven patients with severe atopic dermatitis carried the mutation.",

These effects were similar to those produced by intraperitoneal injection of monoclonal anti-IL-4 antibody. Interestingly, delivery of sIL-4R by way of the airways (nebulized) proved to be a more potent modulator of airways hyperresponsiveness and was also effective in inhibiting hypersensitivity responses-leading the authors to speculate that the soluble receptor may be an effective therapy for allergic responses to aerosolized allergens. A study using intraperitoneal or intranasal sIL-4R in allergen-challenge in a mouse model of asthma recently has been completed. As anticipated, aerosol delivery of soluble receptor effectively blocked aspects of the late-phase pulmonary response (personal communication, W. Henderson, May 1999). Results from these two studies indicate that sIL-4R can be effective when given based on reduced exhaled nitric oxide, significant anti-inflammatory effects were demonstrated in the active treatment group relative to placebo ( P < 0.05). Although allergic rhinitis symptoms were not improved significantly following a single inhaled dose, these data suggest a potential therapeutic role for nasally administered sIL-4R in allergic rhinitis. Supporting the potential therapeutic use of sIL-4R in allergic inflammation is a recent report by Benson et al.*O Using ELISA and ultrasensitive immunoassay, the investigators ascertained the relative levels of cytokines and soluble cytokine receptors in the nasal lavage fluid of 60 schoolchildren with allergic rhinitis before and during pollen season. They found that the levels of TH2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6) correlated with the observed increases in eosinophil numbers and IgE levels, but the levels of T,1 cytokines (IFN-7 and IL-8) did not. In addition, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), IFN-y, IL-lp, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6 levels seemed to correlate with those of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). Soluble IL-6 receptor correlated significantly with eosinophils and soluble IL-4 receptor with IgE levels (P < 0.0001). In most cases, positive correlations between cytokines and their soluble receptors could be demonstrated. Such results imply that the release of soluble cytokine receptors occurs in vivo and that their presence has a modulatory effect on the various cytokines.",
