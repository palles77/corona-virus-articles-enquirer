Two conserved sequences that flank the hypervariable region I (HVR I) in the N-terminus of S1 protein gene were chosen as primers. Sequences of 228-231 base pairs (bp) were amplified by PCR from 25 Taiwan isolates and 4 reference strains (H120, Conn, JMK, Holte). PCR products were digested with 5 restriction endonucleases, BsoFI, DdeI, MboII, AluI, RsaI, and different IBV isolates were grouped according to their RFLP patterns. The RFLP patterns of the 4 reference strains in this study matched the published sequences in GenBank. Except 1 vaccine strain, the other 24 Taiwan isolates were different from these 4 and 18 other IBV strains whose sequences were published. The data from PCR-RFLP and sequencing of IBV genomes showed that the 24 Taiwan isolates can be divided into 2 distinct groups, I and II. Seven RFLP patterns are identified in group I and only 1 in group II. 1678 C.-H. Wang and C.-T. Tsai",

The isolation and identification of IBV isolates throughout Taiwan are important, because vaccines are selected based on the serotypes of IBV in specific geographic areas. Traditionally, IBV serotypes are identified by the virus-neutralization (VN) test which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. However, ambiguous results are sometimes obtained using a serological approach [8, 17] . Recently, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequencing have offered more sensitive and specific methods for identifying IBV strains [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 16] . All known IBV viruses contain three major virus-encoded structural proteins which include the surface projection glycoproteins, the membrane protein, and the nucleocapsid protein [9, 10] . The VN",

In this study, we report a set of olignucleotide primers that is capable of hybridizing to the genome of all known IBV strains. The primers have now been used successfully on 4 known strains and 25 Taiwan isolates. These primers were intended to amplify a portion of the IBV genome that encodes the viral coat protein providing the antigenic determinations. This region of the S1 gene is hypervariable and apparently mutates often enough to thwart efforts to create a universal effective vaccine. The 24 isolates are related distinctly and are different from all known strains of IBV (Mass, American, European and Dutch).",

In the past, the 22 published IBV strains have been divided into 4 groups, i.e. Mass, American, European and Dutch [15] . The results from this study are entirely consistent with that classification. The strains within the Mass, European and Dutch groups are at least 95% homologous. The C2U-C3L region (PCR oligonucleotide primers in Materials and methods) was chosen for the study reported here because phylogenetic results from the sequences in this region match those from the whole S1 gene. The 24 Taiwan isolates differ from those published foreign strains and are, therefore variant strains. Since the 24 isolates have been divided into 8 RFLP patterns it is unlikely that the IBV isolates in Taiwan have evolved from the same origin. However, the nature of their evolution is totally unknown and remains to be studied. For this, it will be necessary to type foreign IBV isolates by PCR-RFLP using the same primers (C2U-C3L) so that they can be compared to the Taiwan isolates.",

PCR-RFLP is a convenient method to classify new isolates, since the C2U-C3L primer set detects all Taiwan isolates. It is necessary to survey whether the prevalent IBV isolates are similar to or different from current vaccine strains. The pathogenicity and immunogenecity of different RFLP patterns of the Taiwan isolates needs further study.
