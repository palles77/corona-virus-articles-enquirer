Thus, far, fly ash has received much attention but less attention has been paid to bottom ash. In this study, bottom ash samples were collected from a typical MW incinerator, and typical pollutants including heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the ash were examined. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy results indicated that CaO, SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 were the main components of the bottom ash. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy showed that the ash contained large amounts of heavy metals, including Zn, Ti, Ba, Cu, Pb, Mn, Cr, Ni and Sn. Most of the heavy metals (e.g., Ba, Cr, Ni, and Sn) presented in the residual fraction; whereas Mn, Pb and Zn presented in Fe-Mn oxides fraction, and Cu in organic-matter fraction. Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure tests indicated that the leached amounts of heavy metals were well below the limits. The sum of 16 US EPA priority PAHs ( PAHs) varied from 10.30 to 38.14 mg kg \u22121 , and the total amounts of carcinogenic PAHs ranged between 4.09 and 16.95 mg kg \u22121 , exceeding the limits regulated by several countries. This research provides basic information for the evaluation of the environmental risk of MW incinerator bottom ash.",

In recent years, many MW incineration facilities have been established in China. Although incineration can reduce the weight of waste by more than 70%, large amounts of combustion residues, especially bottom ash, still remained after incineration. In some densely populated big cities, disposal of the waste ash is becoming increasingly difficult, owing to high cost, diminishing land availability, more stringent regulation, and frequent public opposition to the sifting of new landfills. Bottom ash is not included in the List of Hazardous Waste published by the Environmental Protection Agency of China, thus, this type of material has the potential to be recycled and reused in the interests of achieving sustainable development. When reused, the leachability of toxic metals is the most concern. A recent paper reported that metals, such as Pb, Cr, Cd, Cu and Zn in bottom ashes from a medical waste incinerator were with high leachability [1] . The useful ways to get is, to put ashes in construction materials, or in cement, or to solid waste landfills.",

Previous studies have shown that bot-tom ash from incineration of municipal solid waste (MSW) might be a valuable resource because it can be used as a secondary aggregate in roads and construction materials [3, 4] . Due to the chemical compositions of MW ash and MSW ash are similar, MW ash might be reusable in the same way [5, 6] . However, MW bottom ash has some special characteristics that must be taken into consideration before it can be reused. MW contains large amounts of disposal metallic or plastic materials. Therefore, the bottom ash from MW incineration may contain a large proportion of toxic metallic elements or organic compounds that might hinder its reuse. Previous studies have indicated that MW bottom ash contains higher amounts of heavy metals such as Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn than does MSW bottom ash [5, 7] . In addition, a recent report shows that even though bottom ash is regarded as a non-hazardous material, its TCLP and PBET leachate also showed biotoxicity [8] .",

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are formed during incomplete combustion and are present in bottom ash [11, 12] , persist in the environment, have low biodegradability and are highly carcinogenic to humans [13] . A study of bottom ash from medical waste incineration in Taiwan found that the sum of the amounts of PAHs ( PAHs) ranges from 162 to 3480 g kg \u22121 [14] , and in a study of bottom ash obtained from a clinical waste incinerator, the sum of the amounts of 11 PAHs was found to be 449.3 g kg \u22121 [15] . Currently, there are large amounts of low-standard medical waste incinerators are being operated by some rural and urban medical institutions in China, which are lack of air pollution control devices and without secondary combustion chamber [16] and burning temperature are usually not so high. On the other hand, Chinese medical wastes are collected without sorting, this lead to the large variation in both calorific value and composition. All these factors contribute to uncompleted combustion of medical waste. Thus, the composition and distribution of toxic elements in bottom ash from these incinerators may quite different from that generated from well equipped large incinerator.",

Taken together, the other metal oxides made up about 21% of the ash. Non-metallic elements (P, S and Cl) accounted for approximately 12%. Of the non-metallic elements, Cl was present in the largest quantity, perhaps because increasing amounts of Polyvinyl chloride polymer (PVC), e.g., disposable infusion devices, are used in MW. Moreover, NaCl is reportedly used more frequently in medical treatment in China than in other countries, which might also contribute to the high Cl content in the ash. In this study, the Si/Ca ratio was <1, which is lower than the ratio reported in other studies of MSW incineration ash (Si/Ca > 3) [25, 26] . This result indicates that the compositions of MW and MSW differ in some cases; the MW we studied contained more calcium than silicon, whereas the opposite is true for MSW. Table 2 lists the metal concentrations in the MW bottom ash obtained by ICP-OES. The data indicate that the ash was enriched with various metallic elements. The major metal elements in the ash were Ca, Fe, Al, Mg, Na and K. There were also large amounts of heavy metals such as Zn, Ti, Ba, Cu, Pb, Mn Cr, Ni, Sn, Sr and Ga. Other metals, such as Li, Co, Ag and Bi, were present in very small amounts. The most toxic heavy metals (e.g., Cd and Sb) were below the detection limit in the ash; these elements and their compounds are generally easily volatile and thus, may have ended up in the fly ash. Compared to values reported in other literature for medical waste incinerator ashes, it is found that Ba concentrations in this study are significantly higher [25, 28] . The possible reason is different compositions of raw MW. Hospital wastes in China usually contain high amount of plastic matter, while Ba are usually used as additive in these plastics.",

Elliot et al. and Sukandar et al. reported that the metal content in the exchangeable and carbonate fractions (the mobile fractions) is indicative of the potential availability and leaching of metals [29, 30] . Therefore, the amounts of the various metals in these two fractions indicate that Zn has the highest leaching potential and Ni the lowest. The percentages of metals associated with the Fe-Mn oxides fraction (F3) in the bottom ash were in the 0.41-57.22% range. The percentages of the metals bound to the Fe-Mn oxides fraction decreased in the order Zn > Mn > Pb > Ni > Cr > Cu > Ba > Sn. Metals associated with the Fe-Mn oxides fraction cannot undergo chemical reaction immediately, but their mobility and availability could be affected by changes in environmental conditions [18] . Thus, Zn, Mn and Pb in MW bottom ash may leach into the environment. The percentages of metals bound to the organic fraction (F4) in the bottom ash were low, except for Cu, and accounted for 50.92% of the total. Residual fractions (stable fractions) are generally less mobile, and thus, the metals in them are difficult to leach out into the environment. The proportions of Ba, Cr, Ni and Sn bound to the residual fractions (F5) were much higher than those of the other metals (84.74-97.99%).

(Table 4) . Literature values for carcinogenic compounds in MSW ash range from 89 to 438 g kg \u22121 in bottom ash [11] . Clearly, both the total PAHs and the levels of carcinogenic compounds in our study were much higher than the literature values. This result may be due to differences in the operating conditions for the incinerators (such as combustion temperature and input MW composition) that are suitable for PAHs formation. The operating temperature of the incinerator in this study is around 700-800 \u2022 C, while combustion temperature reported in other literature is over 1000 \u2022 C, promoting complete decomposition of PAHs.",
