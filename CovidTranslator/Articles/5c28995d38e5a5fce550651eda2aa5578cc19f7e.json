Currently available polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines are mainly T cell dependent and are usually ineffective in weakened immune systems. In this study, laminarin, a well-characterized \u2424-1,3-glucan, was conjugated with a prokaryotically expressed recombinant fragment (amino acids [aa] 39 to 272) of calreticulin (rCRT/39 -272), which exhibits extraordinarily potent immunogenicity and adjuvanticity in experimental animals. The resultant conjugate reserves the immunostimulatory effect of rCRT/39 -272 on na\u00efve murine B cells and is capable of eliciting anti-\u2424glucan IgG (mostly IgG1) responses in not only BALB/c mice but also athymic nude mice. Laminarin-CRT-induced mouse antibodies (Abs) are able to bind with Candida albicans and inhibit its growth in vitro. In addition, vaccination with laminarin-CRT partially protects mice from lethal C. albicans challenge. These results imply that rCRT/39 -272 could be used as an ideal carrier or adjuvant for carbohydrate vaccines aimed at inducing or boosting IgG responses to fungal infections in immunodeficient hosts.",

            "text": "C andida albicans is a commensal fungus that colonizes different areas of the human body such as the gastrointestinal tract, pharynx, and vaginal mucosa. It is usually not harmful to the hosts but can become pathogenic and cause local or systemic infections in immunocompromised subjects. For example, neutropenia is a hallmark risk factor for development of disseminated candidasis, while human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are known to be more susceptible to mucosal candidiasis (1, 2) . Despite the fact that cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in antifungal defense, accumulating evidence suggests that antibodies (Abs), particularly IgG, specific for cell surface glycan epitopes of fungi are also indispensable (3) (4) (5) . As one of the major components of the cell wall of C. albicans, \u2424-glucans (\u2424-1,3-glucan backbone with \u2424-1,6-linked branches) have been targeted in antifungal vaccine designs by many laboratories (6) (7) (8) (9) . Like other polysaccharides, \u2424-glucans are T-cell-independent type 2 antigens (Ags) that stimulate only short-lived B cells and drive the production of IgM Abs in vivo (10) . Chemical conjugation of polysaccharides to protein carriers such as tetanus toxoid (TT) and diphtheria toxoid (DT) enhances their immunogenicity and enables them to elicit production of anti-polysaccharide IgG Abs in vivo (11, 12) . Unfortunately, traditional protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines are unable to elicit carbohydrate antigen-specific IgG responses in T-cell-immunodeficient hosts (13, 14) . Furthermore, most of the experimental glycoprotein vaccines require strong adjuvants (e.g., complete Freund's adjuvant) to achieve sufficient immunogenicity, while these adjuvants are usually incompatible with human use (15, 16) . Xin et al. have recently reported a TTcoupled self-adjuvanting glycopeptide vaccine (17) ; whether such a vaccine could also overcome the requirement for T-cell help remains to be tested. Thus, better adjuvant and/or carrier proteins are needed as a necessary component(s) in vaccines for the control of fungal infections in weakened immune systems.",

Although structurally unique, CRT exhibits certain functions similar to those of heat shock proteins (HSPs) (21, 22) . Consequently, CRT is considered a member of the HSP family that possesses potent immunostimulatory activities (23) . We have recently reported that a recombinant fragment (amino acid residues 39 to 272) of mouse CRT (rCRT/ 39 -272) exhibits a robust B-cell-stimulating effect and also that a protein resulting from fusion between rCRT/39 -272 and recombinant enhanced green fluorescent protein (rEGFP) is able to induce anti-EGFP IgG Abs in not only BALB/c mice but also athymus nude mice (24) . Furthermore, CRT has also been tested as an adjuvant for various vaccines against different viruses with promising results, as reported by previous investigators (25, 26) . Our group also demonstrated that a protein resulting from fusion between CRT/39 -272 and a fragment consisting of residues 450 to 650 of the spike protein (S450 -650) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus was also able to induce S450 -650-specific IgG in mice (27) . On the basis of these data, we wondered if CRT/39 -272 could be used as an effective carrier or adjuvant for carbohydrate antigens and assist the production of glycotope-specific IgG Abs in healthy as well as immunocompromised hosts.",

Sodium cyanoborohydride was added to achieve a final concentration of 20 mg/ml, and the mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 days. When the conjugation was complete, sodium borohydride (10 mg/ml) was added to reduce any remaining free aldehyde groups. The conjugate was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Novagen) and judged by the use of Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels. The carbohydrate content of the conjugate was determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid method, and the protein was verified with a Micro bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Bio-Rad). All antigen preparations were filtered through a 0.2-m-pore-size sterile syringe filter (Corning) and passed twice through a polymyxin B column (Sigma-Aldrich), and the endotoxin levels were less than 1 ng/mg, as determined by the use of Endospecy (Seikagaku Kogyo Ltd.).",

Analysis of Ab subtypes revealed that anti-laminarin IgG Abs elicited by LAM-CRT were mainly of the IgG1 subtype (Fig. 2D) . By comparing titration curves of the two groups (Fig. 2E) , it can be estimated that the titers of laminarinspecific IgG1 Abs in mice immunized with LAM-CRT were approximately 16-fold higher than that of the LAM-EGFP-immunized group.

            "text": ". T-cell-deficient athymic nude mice are unable to mount IgG responses to carbohydrate or protein antigens, as T-helper cells are normally indispensable for class switching of the responding B lymphocytes (31) . We have previously shown, however, that rCRT/39 -272 was able to assist IgG production against covalently linked Ags in nude mice (24) . Groups of nude mice were s.c. immunized twice with laminarin, LAM-EGFP, or LAM-CRT and monitored 2 weeks thereafter for laminarin-specific serum IgG by ELISAs. Only LAM-CRT, but not laminarin or LAM-EGFP, was able to induce laminarin-specific IgG responses (Fig. 3A to C) . Laminarin-specific memory B cells seemed to be generated by LAM-CRT immunization in nude mice, since an elevated response to a booster dose was seen (Fig. 3C) , although additional analyses of the phenotype of the responding B cells are needed for a concrete conclusion. These data suggest that the LAM-CRT conjugate could elicit polysaccharide-specific IgG responses in a manner independent of T-cell help in vivo. wild-type BALB/c mice (Fig. 4A ) and nude mice (Fig. 4B ) was analyzed by using ELISAs based on carbohydrate antigens, including dextran, pustulan, linear \u2424-1,3-glucan, laminarin, mannan, alginic acid, and heparin. Laminarin and unbranched linear \u2424-1,3-glucan, but not other carbohydrate Ags tested here, were recognized by IgG Abs in the LAM-CRT-induced antisera. \u2424-Glucan-specific IgG Abs were then affinity purified from the antisera using a laminarin column. The resultant Abs were able to bind with yeast particles, as evidenced in ELISAs as well as in flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 5) . Specificity of the binding was further confirmed by nearly complete blocking by soluble laminarin, but not dextran, in ELISAs ( Fig. 5A and B) .",

However, results from animal experiments completed thus far suggest that this is unlikely to occur. First, despite the facts that CRT/39 -272 was cloned from a mouse source and can be considered a true self-antigen to mice and also that CRT-specific IgG Abs are relatively easily induced in rodents (including BALB/c, C57/BL6N, and C3H mice and Sprague Dawley rats) and rabbits by immunization with rCRT/39 -272 or fusion protein containing rCRT/39 -272, no signs of autoimmune damage were observed throughout the 6-month period after the antigen inoculation (W. J. Li, H.-L. Dong, and C. Hong, unpublished observation). Second, we have recently found that intraperitoneal administration of rCRT/39 -272 effectively modulated cell-mediated immunity (delayed type hypersensitivity [DTH]) and suppressed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in 100 g/mouse, 6 per group) and boosted with 50 g of the same Ag preparations 2 weeks later. Antisera collected on day 28 from each group were pooled, diluted 1/200, and dispensed in triplicate wells that had been precoated with dextran, pustulan, linear \u2424-1,3-glucan, laminarin, mannan, alginic acid, and heparin for ELISAs. HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was employed as a detection Ab followed by development with OPD. Wells not precoated with any Ags (None) were included as a control.

The affinity-purified IgG Abs from BALB/c (C) and nude (D) mice were further analyzed for the ability to bind C. albicans by flow cytometry.

Presumably, LAM-CRT can activate B cells via both B-cell receptors (BCR) and CRTbinding proteins in a synergistic manner, thereby inducing IgG production in the absence of T-cell help. Its binding with cognate BCR selects target Ag-specific B cells, while its contact with CRTbinding proteins on the cell surface drives the activation and class switching of the responding B lymphocytes. CD91 (35) , CD59 (36) , and scavenger receptors (37) have been shown to bind CRT and to facilitate CRT recognition and endocytosis by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Unlike B cells, purified murine T cells were unresponsive to stimulation with rCRT/39 -272 or LAM-CRT (Fig. 1B) . Given that APCs play pivotal roles in T-cell activation, we also tested B-cell-depleted mouse splenocytes (containing T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells as APCs) for responsiveness to stimulation with LAM-CRT and rCRT/39 -272, but no positive response was observed (not shown). It should also be emphasized that, apart from its potent adjuvanticity, rCRT/39 -272 can also function like ordinary carrier proteins in assisting IgG responses to target Ags in a T-cell-dependent fashion. This finding is supported by the fact that the titer of anti-laminarin IgG in LAM-CRT-immunized BALB/c mice was approximately 4-fold higher than that seen with nude mice (compare Fig. 2E and 3D ). In a previous study, we were able to establish CD4 \u03e9 helper T-cell lines using draining lymph node cells from mice s.c. immunized with rCRT/39 -272 (27) , suggesting that rCRT/39 -272 could be presented via the class II antigen-processing pathway.",
