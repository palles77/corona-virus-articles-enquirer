These were compared with previously published sequencing data of other IBV strains, as well as other coronaviruses, in order to correlate the serological and evolutionary relationship of coronaviruses. IBV nucleotide sequence alignment shows that overall the sequences are highly conserved, with homologies from 91.1 to 96.5%. However, there are also two regions (730 to 800 and 1138 to 1166) that appear to be even more highly conserved. Overall, the nucleocapsid protein is highly variable both in size and composition between coronavirus major antigenic groups but is conserved within these groups. A phylogenetic tree of the nucleocapsid protein of various coronaviruses indicates that the coronaviruses fall into distinct groups that correspond to the three major antigenic groups; however, a phylogenetic tree of the IBV nucleocapsid shows that this does not hold true for the type specific antigenic groups of IBV.

The nucleocapsid protein is produced in especially large quantities during replication @need et al., 1989) and has also been shown to be recognized by T-cell hybridomas in association with the MHC II (Boots et al., 1991) . As such, the nucleocapsid protein may be a useful component of a synthetic vaccine. The nucleocapsid protein of coronaviruses is closely associated with the RNA genome, has been shown to be involved in transcription of MHV, and may be involved in translation (~ompton et al., 1987) .",

At least two clones of each strain were obtained and these were sequenced in both directions. Resulting sequences were analyzed using the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group programs. Nucleotide sequences were processed using the Seqed program and the corresponding nucleocapsid protein amino acid sequences were derived by the Translate program. Comparisons of nucleotide and amino acid sequences were made using Gap and Bestfit. Sequences were aligned using Pileup, with the output being displayed either as a sequence alignment using the program Publish, or as a phylogenetic tree using the Macintosh program PAUP version 3.0. The sequencing data in Fig. 1 include the entire nucleocapsid genes of Gray, Ark99 and Ho1152 aligned with the published sequences of Beaudette, Mass41 and KB8523. This alignment indicates that overall the sequences are highly conserved with some regions showing no variation at all. Table 1 shows that the percent similarity of the nucleotide sequences encoding the nucleocapsid protein ranges from 90.9 between Mass41 and Ho1152, to 96.5% between Ark99 and Gray.",

Unlike many of the other coronaviruses, the IBV nucleocapsid gene does not appear to have a large internal ORF. The alignment of the amino acid sequences shows that there is a large region of absolute identity between residues 238 and 293 (Fig. 2) which corresponds to a highly basic region. It also appears that the protein is more conserved in the central region than at the ends. Two-way comparisons among the nucleocapsid proteins of these 6 strains of IBV indicate that the similarities range from 94.4 to 98.3%, with Beaudette and Ho1152 having the least similarity, and Gray and Ark99 the most (Table 1) .",

Overall sequence similarities classify IBV with the other coronaviruses but the degree of divergence indicates that IBV clearly represents a distinct group. Serological studies have shown that coronaviruses fall into three antigenic groups (Dea et al., 1990) . These antigenic groups are defined by cross-reactivity among the structural proteins. Corresponding coronavirus groups can also be distinguished in the phylogenetic tree in Fig. 3 , suggesting a co-evolution of the nucleocapsid protein with the other components that define the antigenic groups. BCV, TCV and HCV-OC43 all appear to be genetically closely related when looking at the nucleocapsid protein and clearly fall into the same antigenic group as MHV, that is group II; however, MHV appears to have diverged away from the other members of group II. Within group I there appears to be a wide evolutionary distance separating HCV-229E from FIP and TGEV.",

This suggests that Gray and Ark99 may have diverged more recently from a common lineage. This correlates with the observation that the Gray and Ark99 strains have both appeared more recently in the USA, and they are more closely related to each other than to the other strains of IBV. However, the Ho1152 and Beaudette strains have the lowest similarity scores (Table 1 ) even though they are in the same serotype, suggesting that recombination may be occurring within the IBV groups. Nucleotide sequencing of the spike gene has also indicated that recombination is occurring between serologically distinct IBV serotypes (personal observations, E.W. Collisson and L. Wang).",

The close correlation between antigenic grouping from serotyping and from nucleocapsid sequences implies that the spike and nucleocapsid proteins are evolving parallel to each other within distinct major antigenic groups. Thus, classification of major coronavirus groups may actually be determined on the basis of either spike or nucleocapsid protein and presumably, this grouping could also apply to the other coronavirus genes. If recombination is naturally occurring as is expected (Cavanagh and Davis, 19881 , it would seem to be occurring within these major antigenic groups, such as is seen with poliovirus (Agut et al., 1987) .

Therefore, any highly conserved regions may be worth considering as potential vaccine components, especially if such determinants can be recognized by either B-or T-cells. Although the nucleocapsid protein is variable among the different coronaviruses, it is generally highly conserved among strains within a species, such as IBV in chickens.
