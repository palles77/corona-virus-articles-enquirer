The virome with the human-infection potential is far from complete. Novel viruses have been discovered at an unprecedented pace as the rapid development of viral metagenomics. However, there is still a lack of a method for rapidly identifying the virus with the human-infection potential. This study built several machine learning models for discriminating the human-infecting viruses from other viruses based on the frequency of k-mers in the viral genomic sequences. The k-nearest neighbor (KNN) model could predict the human-infecting virus with an accuracy of over 90%. Even for the KNN models built on the contigs as short as 1kb, they performed comparably to those built on the viral genomes, suggesting that the models could be used to identify the human-infecting virus from the viral metagenomic sequences. This work could help for discovery of novel human-infecting virus in metagenomics studies.",

Many viruses may remain undiscovered, even if they have already entered into human populations (Rosenberg 2015) . Traditional diagnostic methods such as polymerase chain reaction, immunological assays and pan-viral microarrays are limited in their ability to identify novel viruses with the potential to infect humans. Rapid development of viral metagenomic sequencing in recent years provides a powerful high-throughput and culture-independent means to identify new viruses, which leads to accumulation of new viruses at an unprecedented pace (Alavandi and Poornima 2012) . The Global Virome Project (GVP), which was proposed and initiated in the beginning of 2018, estimated that there were over 1.67 million yet-to-be-discovered viruses in animal reservoirs, and between 631,000 to 827,000 of these unknown viruses have the capacity to infect humans (Carroll, Daszak et al. 2018) .

As far as we know, this study for the first time attempted to discriminate the human-infecting virus from non-human-infecting virus in the perspective of virome.The human-infecting virus used here has different ability of infecting humans. Some of them are human viruses and have been circulating in human populations for a long time, such as the human papillomavirus(Baseman and Koutsky 2005) and yellow fever virus(Akondy, Monson et al. 2009); while some of them were zoonotic and only infect humans rarely, such as the avian influenza virus and coronavirus. As was shown in numerous studies, the zoonotic viruses are very likely to cause epidemics or even pandemics after adaptive mutations. The most recent example is the Zika virus.It rarely caused wide-spread epidemics in humans, even in highly enzootic areas, in the 20 th century. However, a few mutations on the viral genome facilitated its rapid spread in human populations. The virus has caused epidemics in more than 50 countries and has infected more than one million people since 2014 (Prevention and Control 2016, de Oliveira Garcia 2019). Taken together, it is difficult to distinguish between viruses with different extent of infecting humans. Therefore, the human-infecting virus with varying ability of infecting humans were considered equally in the modeling.There are some limitations to this study. Firstly, the human-infecting virus is far from complete when compared to that estimated by the GVP. But they covered viruses of 30 families in all groups of the Baltimore classification, which was similar to that estimated by the GVP. Besides, the machine learning models had excellent performances in discriminating the human-infecting virus from other viruses. They could help much in discovering novel human-infecting viruses. infect humans after adaptive mutations. Secondly, the number of human-infecting virus is much smaller than that of other viruses. Such a large imbalance may hinder accurate modeling. Here, the under-sampling method was used to deal with the imbalance problem. The KNN",
