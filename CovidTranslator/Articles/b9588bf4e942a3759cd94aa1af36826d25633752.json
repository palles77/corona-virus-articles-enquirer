            "text": "he genus enterovirus is a member of the family picornavirus, a historically ancient virus species. Enteroviruses includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses A and B, echoviruses, and recently identified enteroviruses [1, 2] . Most enteroviruses enter the body through the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract and usually cause mild diseases; however, they can cause encephalitis, paralysis, and myocarditis [3] . Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is one major pathogen of viral myocarditis, a condition that may evolve into dilated cardiomyopathy. The pathogenic mechanisms of CVB3-induced myocarditis include directly attacking the heart tissue and those involving the host immune response to CVB3 infection [4] . The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential organelle of eukaryotic cells responsible for protein folding and modification, lipid biosynthesis, and calcium homeostasis [5] . When circumstances change, such as with glucose deprivation, hypoxia, aberrant Ca 2+ regulation, and pathogen invasion, the unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, resulting in ER stress [6] . In response to ER stress, an intracellular adaptive mechanism called the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated. UPR recovers ER homeostasis by attenuating protein synthesis, upregulating protein folding and trafficking machinery, and activating the ER-associated degradation system. However, when ER stress is so prolonged and severe that ER function cannot be restored, UPR will removes the damaged cells by activating apoptosis [7] . ER stress and ER stress-induced UPR play important roles in the course of virus infection [8] . Many plus-strand RNA viruses, including CVB3, Japanese encephalitis virus, dengue virus, and hepatitis C virus, may modify the ER membrane, exploit the ER, or reduce the ER calcium concentration during their infection. Then viral infection leads to imbalance of ER function and, subsequently, actives ER stress [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

Autophagy alleviates ER stress by removal of the aggregated protein and the portions of the expanded ER [5, 6] . Additionally, several forms of virus-activated ER stress subsequently regulates autophagy [20] [21] [22] . Previous studies have shown that CVB3 infection activates ER stress and autophagy [9, 23] , but the relationship of ER stress and autophagy is still not completely understood. In our study, we have demonstrated that CVB3 infection activated all 3 pathways of ER stress contributing to autophagy.",

Western blotting showed that more PERK (phosphorylated PERK) migrated at a higher molecular weight in CVB3-infected cells than in mock-infected cells ( Figure 4A) , which was consistent with previous researches indicating the phosphorylated PERK shifts slower in polyacrylamide gels than the latent form of the kinase [30, 31] .

Therefore the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II is a key step in autophagy [23] . To determine whether autophagy was induced by CVB3 infection, we first measured the expression level of LC3-I and LC3-II by Western blot assay at 6, 8, and 10 h postinfection. As shown in Figure 5A and 5B, CVB3 induced the conversion from LC3-I to LC3-II, and the expression of LC3-II reached its highest level at 10 h postinfection, which demonstrated that CVB3 infection induced autophagy. To further confirm the above results, we examined the distribution of LC3 in CVB3-infected HeLa cells using confocal microscopy. The results showed that CVB3 infection contributed to the obvious accumulation of green fluorescent dots from GFP-LC3 expression (Figure 6) , which again showed that CVB3 infection increased formation of autophagosomes.",

In CVB3-infected cells, p62 expression gradually decreased and reached a minimum level at 10 h postinfection ( Figure 5A and 5C).

            "text": "Ongoing studies demonstrate that ER stress regulates autophagy and ATF6, IRE1, and PERK signal pathways of ER stress participate in the activation of autophagy in various ways. Under ER stress, PERK-eIF2\u03b1 upregulates the expression of transcription factor ATF4, which activates another transcription factor, CHOP. ATF4 and CHOP translocate to the nucleus to regulate autophagy-related gene expression [5] . IRE1 interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-2 and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 to activate Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) [6] . Then, the activated JNK phosphorylates Bcl-2 to free Bcl-2 from the Beclin-1/Bcl-2 complex, which contributes to the nucleation of autophagy. Meanwhile, IRE1-mediated XBP1 splicing also promotes autophagy through transcriptional activation of autophagy-related genes [40, 41] . Proteolytic ATF6, as an activated transcription factor, participates in regulation of the expression of GRP78 and AKT to induce autophagy [42, 43] . In our study, inhibition of IRE1, PERK, or ATF6 signaling pathways of the UPR sensor decreased the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I in CVB3-infected HeLa cells, which demonstrated that CVB3 infection triggered autophagy through the IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 signaling pathways. mTOR is a negative regulator of autophagy. mTOR1 inhibits autophagy through regulation of unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) complex, which composed of ULK1, autophagy-related gene 13 (ATG13), and focal adhesion kinase familyinteracting protein of 200 kD (FIP200) in mammals [44, 45] . In our study, CVB3 infection decreased the expression of total mTOR. A possible explanation is that CVB3 2A or 3C protease may cleave mTOR and decrease the expression of mTOR. Because there are many enterovirus protease cleavage sites on mTOR, which were predicted by NetPicoRNA 1.0 Server [46] . Several kinases, including PERK, protein kinase double-stranded RNA-dependent (PKR), general control non-derepressible-2 (GCN2), and heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) may phosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 to prevent protein synthesis and regulate stress-related gene expression. These kinase are respectively activated by ER stress, virus infection, uncharged tRNAs, and heme depletion [47] . One report showed that CVB3 infection triggered activation of PKR, not PERK, to phosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 [9] . However, our results first demonstrated that both PERK and PKR (data not shown) were activated during CVB3 infection.",
