            "text": "Connexins, the proteins that form gap junction channels, are polytopic plasma membrane (PM) proteins that traverse the plasma membrane bilayer four times. The insertion of five different connexins into the membrane of the ER was studied by synthesizing connexins in translation-competent cell lysates supplemented with pancreatic ER-derived microsomes, and by expressing connexins in vivo in several eucaryotic cell types. In addition, the subcellular distribution of the connexins was determined. In vitro-synthesis in the presence of microsomes resulted in the signal recognition particle-dependent membrane insertion of the connexins. The membrane insertion of all connexins was accompanied by an efficient proteolytic processing that was dependent on the microsome concentration. Endogenous unprocessed connexins were detectable in the microsomes used, indicating",

            "text": "that the pancreatic microsomes serve as a competent recipient in vivo for unprocessed full length connexins. Although oriented with their amino terminus in the cytoplasm, the analysis of the cleavage reaction indicated that an unprecedented processing by signal peptidase resulted in the removal of an amino-terminal portion of the cormexins. Variable amounts of similar cormexin cleavage products were also identified in the ER membranes of connexin overexpressing cells. The amount generated correlated with the level of protein expression. These results demonstrate that the connexins contain a cryptic signal peptidase cleavage site that can be processed by this enzyme in vitro and in vivo in association with their membrane insertion. Consequently, a specific factor or condition must be required to prevent this aberrant processing of connexins under normal conditions in the cell. C rIANNEL-forming membrane proteins, similar to other plasma membrane (PM) t proteins, are usually synthesized on ribosomes bound to the ER membrane and inserted cotranslationally into this membrane. Subsequently, the proteins are transported to the PM passing through the classical secretory pathway of the cell (Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987) . For translocation into the ER membrane, the proteins need a signal specific for ER membrane targeting that is encoded in the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide chain, either as a cleavable signal sequence on the NH~ terminus and processed by signal peptidase, or as an internal signal anchor sequence (Blobel, 1980; Walter et al., 1984) . After insertion into the ER membrane, the polypeptide domains fold into their final conformation, and they eventually oligomerize most likely with the help of different chaperones, folding enzymes, and metabolic energy (Rothman, 1989; Hendrick and Hartl, 1993) . It can be concluded that connexins follow the secretory pathway based on subcellular connexin distribution studies presented in this paper and from studies reported by other investigators. Studies performed with wild-type connexin-expressing cells isolated from rat liver (this study; Rahman et al., 1993) and dog pancreas (acinar cells, this study), as well as tissue culture cell lines naturally expressing connexins (normal rat kidney fibroblasts [NRK 49F], Musil and Goodenough, 1991) , or transfected with connexin cDNAs (BHK cells; this study) showed connexin proteins in the ER membranes, the Golgi membranes, and in the plasma membranes isolated from these cells.",

            "text": "In this study, we analyzed the translocation and the transmembrane organization of the gap junction (GJ) proteins (connexins) in the membranes of the ER. Connexins, together with other aqueous channel-forming membrane proteins, represent specialized polytopic transmembrane proteins that are distinguished by the localization of charged amino acid residues within their transmembrane regions. At present, 12 different connexins have been cloned and sequenced from mammals. All represent structurally conserved, nonglycosylated members of a multigene family (Kumar and Gilula, 1992) . Connexins traverse the PM bilayer four times oriented with their amino and carboxy termini located in the cytoplasm (Ncyt-C\u00a2~ orientation). This membrane topology was suggested by hydropathy analyses of the primary amino acid sequences (Milks et al., 1988) , and it is supported by various topological analyses of the connexin protein structure, such as site-directed antibody localizations combined with immunoelectron microscopy (Hertzberg et al., 1988; Milks et al., 1988; Laird and Revel, 1990; Rahman and Evans, 1991; E1 Aoumari et al., 1992) , protease digestions of isolated GJ structures (Zimmer et al., 1987; Hertzberg et al., 1988) , or the analysis of intramolecular disulfide bridges (Rahman and Evans, 1991) . The NH2terminal cytoplasmic domain of the connexins consists of a short stretch of 22-23 amino acid residues, and no cleavable signal sequence is present within the NH2-terminal region. Consequently, the first and/or one of the other transmembrane hydrophobic regions must function as an internal signal anchor sequence(s). After their membrane integration, connexins must oligomerize to form a functional GJ hemichannel (Makowski et al., 1977) . At the PM, two hemichannels, one provided by each of two neighboring cells, associate to form a double-membrane hydrophilic channel that creates a cytoplasmic continuity.",

Protease inhibitors N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TICK), Nt~-p-tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), E-64, and lenpeptin were added to individual aliquots to a final concentration of 1 mM from 10x stock solutions and incubated for 10 re_in at 30\u00b0C before synthetic RNA was added. To modify reaction conditions from more reducing conditions (small amounts of DTT are present in the [35S]methionine and in the microsome preparations) to oxidizing conditions that allow posttranslational S-S bridge formation, oxidized glutathione was added in variable amounts from 0.1 to 5 mM final concentration to the translocation reactions, according to Marquardt ct al.

Fluorographs of the translation products after SDS-PAGE are shown. Full-size polypeptides are indicated as c~1,/~t,/3z,/33, and a3.

Translation reactions showed the first detectable synthesis of full-size GJ protein after ,07 min in the presence of microsomes (shown for cq GJ protein, lane 6). The faster migrating GJ protein product is generated after the same translation time. Aggregates of GJ polypeptides not entering the separating gels were especially prominent after long reaction times and in absence of microsomes. A schematic representation of the overall membrane topology for cormexins is shown on the right. The connexins mainly differ from each other in the length of their COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The cytoplasmic and the lumenal/exoplasmic sides of translocation assays supplemented with canine pancreatic microsomes (Walter and Blobel, 1983) have been found to integrate several type I, II, and III membrane proteins with a relevant membrane topology (e.g., Lipp and Dobberstein, 1986b; Spiess and Lodish, 1986; Zerial et al., 1986; Mayer et al., 1988) .

The faster migrating translation products were generated with all connexin cRNAs translated in these assays (Fig. 1,   lanes 3 -10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20, and 22) . This finding was surprising because no general connexin modification has been described that could account for the observed increase in electrophoretic mobility. Endogenous ~1 GJ proteins isolated from mammalian tissues correspond in their electrophoretic mobility to the full-size translation products (compare Fig. 3 A) . Translocation reactions incubated for very short time periods always showed equivalent amounts of modified and unmodified translation products in the individual reactions, even at time periods when the translation of connexin polypeptides was still continuing (Fig. 1, lanes 3-8; shown for c~ GJ protein only). This result indicates that the processing occurred cotranslationally or, at least, in close relationship to the translocation reaction.",

Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. At pH 7.0, as well as at pH 11.5, the faster migrating processed GJ proteins (c~' and/3,~ were primarily abundant in the pellet fractions (lanes 2 and 4, 14, and  16) , while the unprocessed full-size products (a~ and/3~) were primarily abundant in the supernatant fractions (lanes 1 and 3, and 13 and  15 ). The integral membrane protein acetylcholine receptor subunit c~7 (AChR c~7, lanes 5 and 6, and 17 and 18), the secretory proteins preprolactin (pPL, lanes 7 and 8, 19 and 20) and yeast a-factor (co-factor, lanes 9 and 10, 21 and 22), and the cytoplasmic protein/~-globin (lanes 11 and 12, 23 and 24) were analyzed in parallel. These proteins gave the expected results, namely the B-globin was completely located in the supernatant (lanes H and 23) , and the mature, glycosylated integral membrane protein AChR c~7\" (lane 18), but not the mature secretory proteins PL and a-factor* (lanes 20 and 22), was resistant to alkali treatment. the connexins was obtained by characterizing the conditions that promoted the specific cleavage reaction in more detail. Fig. 6 A shows that the proteolytic cleavage of the connexins occurred only if the membrane vesicles were added cotrans-lationaUy ( Fig. 6 A, lane 2) . The cleavage was completely abolished when the microsomes were added after translations were blocked by the addition of RNase (Fig. 6 A, lane  3) . The proteolytic activity was restricted to the lumen of the microsomes as indicated by the fact that only microsomes (Fig. 6 A, lane 5) , and not microsomal supernatants derived from pelleted microsomes (Fig. 6 A, lane 4) , efficiently processed the GJ proteins. Preincubation of the translocation reactions with the serine and cysteine protease inhibitors TPCK, TLCK, E-64, leupeptin, and DFP (each 1 mM final concentration) before the addition of synthetic RNAs had no effect on the cleavage reaction (Fig. 6 B, lanes 3-7) . The potential dependence of the connexin cleavage on the signal recognition particle (SRP) was determined by using microsomes depleted from SRP by a high salt wash in combination with purified SRP. In translation reactions supplemented with SRP-depleted microsomes, only uncleaved connexins were detected (Fig. 6 C, lanes 3 and 7) , while cleaved connexins were generated if the depleted microsomes were supplemented with purified SRP (Fig. 6 C, lanes  4 and 8) . In summary, all of these results indicated a specific, but atypical, proteolytic processing by signal peptidase.

Immunoprecipitations were analyzed on SDS-protein gels, allowing the resolution of small polypeptide fragments. Polypeptides were visualized by fluorograpby.

Since the amount of connexin polypeptides present in the ER membranes is relatively low in normal connexin expressing cells (rat hepatocytes, dog pancreatic acinar cells, Fig. 3 ), making such an analysis relatively difficult, we expressed higher levels of the ot~ and/~ GJ proteins for this analysis by using heterologous eukaryotic protein expression systems (yeast, baculovirus, BHK cells, Fig. 8 A) . Expressed connexins were analyzed either by immunoblot analyses or by the immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled proteins. Analysis of the expressed proteins showed that connexins with a processed NH2-terminal domain, similar to the products found in vitro, were detectable in all cell types analyzed (Fig. 8 A, left panel: ~1 GJ protein-transfected yeast cells, lanes 1, 3, 5; middle panel: insect cells infected with an Otl GJ protein expressing baculovirus, lanes 10 and 11; right panel: BHK cells stably transfected with c~ or/3~ GJ protein, lanes 18, 19, 25, 27, 29, and 30) . While yeast transfectants generated nearly equal amounts of processed and full-size connexins, the majority of the connexin protein generated in the infected insect cells, and especially in the transfected BHK cells, appeared to be the unprocessed full-size protein. Using the transfected BHK cells that allow the expression of variable amounts of protein (the connexin cDNAs are inserted behind a heavy metal inducible promoter), it was possible to demonstrate that the generation of the NH~-terminally processed cormexin products correlated with the level of connexin expression (Fig. 8 A, right panel) . Under moderate expression conditions (50 #M zinc), only intact c~t or/3t GJ protein was detectable (Fig. 8 A, lanes 14-16, and 22 and  23) , while conditions of intermediate (100 #M zinc, Fig. 8  A, lanes 24 and 25) or high connexin protein expression (125-150 #M zinc, Fig. 8 A, lanes 17-19 and 26--30) resulted in the synthesis of increasing amounts of NH2-terminally cleaved (c~1' and/30, as well as intact cormexin proteins.",

The cleaved connexin products were only detectable in the ER membrane containing fractions (Fig. 8 B, lanes 1, 5, and 9 ). This result indicates that the NH2-terminally cleaved connexin product generated in the transfected BI-IK cells was similar to the product generated in the in vitro translocation assays, and for example, was not related to the degradation of PM GJ structures. A small amount of processed connexin protein present in the PM fraction prepared from/3, GJ protein expressing cells (Fig.  8 B, lane 6 ) was most likely related to a slight contamination of this subcellular fraction with some ER derived membranes. This was indicated by the presence of some PDI, an ER specific marker protein in the PM fraction (Fig. 8 C) . Only the intact connexin product was detected in the Golgi fractions ( Fig. 8 B, lanes 3, 7, and 1/) . Additional, slower migrating protein products present in Fig. 8 , A and B, (also in Fig. 3 A) represent oligomerized connexin proteins (especially in Fig. 8 A, lanes 3 and 5; Fig. 8 B, lanes 5-8; Fig.  3 A, lanes 4 and 5) and some other nonspecifically detected cellular proteins (especially in Fig. 8 B, lanes 1-4 and 9; Fig.  3 A, lane 3) .",

            "text": "The results presented in this report provide direct evidence of the cotranslational membrane integration of connexin polypeptides into the ER membrane. The integration occurred in an SRP-dependent manner. The membrane integration was accompanied by an unprecedented and efficient proteolytic processing of the connexins when translocated in vitro into ER-derived microsomes, removing an aminoterminal portion of all connexins analyzed. Furthermore, the microsomes used in this analysis contained endogenous uncleaved full-length /5~ connexin, indicating that the pancreatic microsomes generated from the ER during isolation were competent to integrate connexins correctly when the cells were intact. An analysis of connexins generated in beterologous eucaryotic expression systems indicated that this proteolytic processing occurred also under in vivo c~nditions of elevated connexin expression when connexin polypeptides were translocated into the ER membrane. The expression of ot~ and/31 GJ protein consistently resulted in the generation of variable amounts of processed cormexin polypeptides ( Fig. 8 A) , independent of the expression system. Subcellular fractionation provided evidence that the ER membranes contained both the processed and full-length connexin polypeptides, while the Golgi membranes and the PM contained only full-length connexins (Fig. 8 B) . BHK cells expressing different amounts of connexin protein also showed that the generation of the processed polypeptides correlated with the level of protein expression (Fig. 8 A) . GJ protein cDNAs were cloned into eucaryotic protein expression vectors and expressed in yeast, baculovirus, or stable transfected BHK cells, respectively. Yeast proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis with the cormexin-specific anti-peptide antibodies GAP 10, ill J, and ~/IS. Nontransfected yeast cell lysates were analyzed as controls. Cormexins expressed in the presence of [35S]methionine in baeulovirus-infected cells and BHK cells, respectively, were immtmoprecipitated from complete cell lysates using the anti-peptide antibodies Bt 1-6, cqJ, c~lS (at GJ protein), or BtB, BiJ and BtS (Bi GJ protein), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by fluorography. Synthetic cormexin RNAs translated in the absence (-) or presence (+) of microsomes were analyzed in parallel as controls. In all three systems, the NH2-terminally processed, faster migrating cormexins (cC and /~13 were detected together with the unprocessed full-size connexins (c~1 and/~l). The BHK cell expression system allows the expression of variable amounts of connexin protein, since the connexin eDNA is inserted behind a heavy metal inducible promoter. Increasing the induction conditions (0.05, 0.1, 0.125, and 0.15 mM zinc) resulted in an equal increase in connexin expression for both full-size and NH2-terminally processed connexins (lanes 14-19 and 22-30) . (B) Highly induced BHK cells expressing c~ or ~1 GJ protein were separated into subeellular #actions containing either rER membranes, Golgi membranes, or PM, respectively, as described in Materials and Methods. Subcellular fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis with GJ protein-specific anti-peptide antibodies GAP 10,/3tS and cqS. Complete cell lysates were analyzed in parallel as controls. Full-size (at,/~) and NH2-terminally processed GJ proteins (~', ~t') were detected in the fractions as marked. (C) The presence of PDI using an antibody raised against bovine PDI was determined to verify the purity of the subcellular membrane preparations derived from fl~ GJ protein-expressing BHK cells.",

            "text": "However, a proteolytic processing of the connexin proteins by signal peptidase is indicated by the results in this study. All the following properties of the connexin processing are indicative of a cleavage by signal peptidase. First, the connexins were proteolytically processed in proximity to their NH2 terminus, removing the NH2-terminal portion of the proteins. This processing appears very similar to the cleavage of cleavable ER target signal sequences (Blobel, 1980; Walter et al., 1984) . Second, the cleavage occurred concomitant with the insertion into the ER membrane, also typical for the processing of cleavable signal sequences (Fig. 1) . Third, the proteolytic cleavage reaction was restricted to the lumen of the ER vesicles (Fig. 6 A) . Signal peptidase is known to be present and active in the microsomes used in our studies (Evans et al., 1986) . Finally, the cleavage was not affected by efficient serine protease inhibitors (Fig. 6 B , DFP, TPCK, and TLCK), a property described for signal peptidase and attributed to its unusual cleavage mechanism (Daibey and yon Heijne, 1992) . Taken together, a potential proteolytic processing of connexin proteins by signal peptidase is indicated by the findings in this study, raising the question, what prevents this cleavage in vivo? Some examples of an internal signal peptidase processing on \"cryptic sites were previously reported for type I (cytochrome P 450) and type II membrane proteins (invariant chain [I'y], asialoglycoprotein receptor H1 subunit) after modifying the structure of the NH2-terminal domains of those proteins that altered their overall charge (Lipp and Dobberstein, 1986a; Schmid and Spiess, 1988; Szczesna-Skorupa et al., 1988) . However, these examples clearly differ from our findings in that the connexins were translated as noumutated, wild-type proteins.",

In previous studies, this protease protection assay has been used extensively to analyze the membrane insertion of proteins and to determine the membrane orientation of different types of membrane anchored proteins (Lipp and Dobberstein, 1986b; Spiess and Lodish, 1986; Zerial et al., 1986; Mayer et al., 1988; Chavez and Hall, 1992; Skach et al., 1994; Gafvelin and yon Heijne, 1994) . We found that the intracellular loop domain of the/31 connexin was protected from proteolytic degradation when trypsin or proteinase K were added exogenously to the microsomes, while it was degraded when the microsomes were permeabilized with detergent before the addition of protease (Fig. 7) . This result indicates that either the intracellular loop domain was located inside the vesicle lumen, suggesting an inverted membrane topology for the NH2-terminaily processed connexins (hypothesized in an earlier report, Falk et al., 1994) , or that the intracellular loop was resistant to proteolytic degradation under the conditions applied. An inverted membrane topology would be consistent with the processing of a cryptic signal peptidase cleavage site motif (small, uncharged amino acid residues in positions -3 and -1; von Heijne, 1983) that exists in connexins in front of transmembrane region M1. Proteolytic processing at this site is suggested by the mobility shift of 2-2.5 kD observed on the protein gels.",

            "text": "However, an inversion of the transmembrane orientation of connexins is not simple to explain, and several observations argue against an inverted membrane topology. First, an inversion of the membrane topology of connexins would suggest that their COOH-terminal domain would also be located in the vesicle lumen, and thus is protected from proteolytic degradation. No such connexin fragments were precipitated in the protease protection assays using the COOH terminus-specific antipeptide antibodies/31S (Fig. 7) , indicating that the COOH terminus was correctly located outside the microsomal vesicles. Second, protease digestions of isolated PM-derived GJ structures indicate that the intracellular loop domain of/31 GJ protein is accessible to proteases, but it seems to be relatively resistant to a complete proteolysis (Milks et al., 1988) . In digests peformed with endoproteinase Lys-C, the intracellular loop was only cleaved on its COOH-terminal side, while the NH2-terminal side resisted degradation. Therefore, it seems likely that the t31 GJ protein fragments that were precipitated in the protease protection assays with the ~lJ antibodies were generated by an incomplete degradation of the intracellular loop, rather than by its protection from proteolysis by the lipid bilayer of the membrane vesicles. Third, preliminary amino acid sequencing results obtained from radiolabeled NH2-terminally processed/31 connexin indicates that the potential signal peptidase cleavage site is located beyond the transmembrane region M1, suggesting that the extracellular loop E1 is correctly located in the lumen of the microsomes (unpublished results). Finally, in this context, it is also interesting to mention a study by Sipos and von Heijne (1993) that shows that the distribution of positively charged amino acid residues in the regions flanking the first transmembrane region of/31 connexin is consistent with its proposed transmembrane topology in the PM. Based on the distribution of positively and negatively charged amino acid residues flanking the transmembrane region, some models have been developed to predict the membrane orientation of bitopic membrane proteins (von Heijne and Gavel, 1988; Hartmann et al., 1989) . Recent data obtained in Escherichia coli suggests that these models could also apply for polytopic membrane proteins (Andersson and von Heijne, 1994; Gafvelin and von Heijne, 1994) to predict their transmembrane topology. Additional experiments and other approaches will be required to determine unequivocally the actual transmembrane orientation of the connexin proteins in the ER membrane. The results of this study demonstrate that the connexins contain a \"cryptic\" signal peptidase cleavage site that can be processed by this enzyme in association with their membrane insertion. What then prevents this proteolytic cleavage under normal conditions in vivo? One possibility is that an additional factor exists that permits the connexin polypeptides to obtain a proper localization within the membrane bilayer, thus preventing their cleavage. A factor binding to cytoplasmic domains of the connexins is possibly indicated by the results obtained with the proteolytic degradation of connexins. Although potentially accessible to proteolytic degradation, the NH2-terminal domain and the intracellular loop region of cormexins were found to be highly resistant to protease digestion (Zimmer et al., 1987; Milks et al., 1988; this study) . Recently, Musil and Goodenough (1993) reported the oligomerization of or1 cormexin after its exit from the ER in a cell culture line. Consequently, it seems plausible to propose that a factor that may prevent the oligomerization process in the ER may also be involved in the integration of connexins into the ER membrane.",
