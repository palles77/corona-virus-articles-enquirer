Chronic HCV causes liver disease and is linked with liver cancer. Viral innate immune evasion strategies and human genetic determinants underlie the transition of acute HCV infection to viral persistence and the support of chronic infection. Host genetic factors, such as sequence polymorphisms in IFNL3, a gene in the host interferon system, can influence both the outcome of infection and response to antiviral therapy. Recent insights into how HCV regulates innate immune signaling within the liver reveal a complex interaction of patient genetic background with viral and host factors of innate immune triggering and control that impart the outcome of HCV infection and immunity.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major public health problem that infects approximately 170 million people worldwide 1 . Infection occurs within hepatocytes, the chief parenchymal cell of the liver. HCV typically causes a chronic infection, and is a major cause of liver disease, liver transplantation, and liver cancer 2 . The first line of immune defense against HCV relies on cell-intrinsic innate immunity within hepatocytes. This innate immune response serves to recognize HCV as non-self and induces local antiviral defenses in the infected cell and liver tissue which can function to recruit and modulate the actions of immune cells of the adaptive immune response. Hepatic innate immunity is therefore essential for controlling the outcome of HCV infection and immunity. However, the majority of those infected with HCV fail to mount a productive immune response that clears infection. Underscoring this problem is that HCV has evolved multiple mechanisms to regulate and evade innate immunity, thus providing a foundation for chronic infection. The standard of care therapy for HCV infection has been treatment with pegylated IFN-\u03b1 plus ribavirin. As an antiviral cytokine, IFN is an innate immune therapeutic but is very unpleasant for the patient and for those infected with the difficult to treat HCV genotypes (1 and 4) it is only curative 40-50% of the time 3 . While first-generation direct acting antiviral drugs are now being introduced into the clinic, they are applied in combination with IFN to enhance efficacy and reduce chances for viral resistance breakthrough [4] [5] . Moreover, underlying HCV infection outcome are polymorphisms in IFNL3 (also referred to as IL28B), a human gene of the host system of innate antiviral defense, and these polymorphisms can influence both the outcome of infection and response to therapy [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Understanding how HCV regulates hepatic innate immune responses is essential for guiding the improvement of HCV therapy, developing effective vaccine applications, and designing new therapeutic strategies to control infection and suppress liver disease. In this perspective, we will describe how both virus and host control of innate immune factors contribute to HCV persistence in the liver and how these virus/host interactions impact the outcome of infection, immunity, and current IFN-based antiviral therapy.",

After entry into hepatocytes, the virus uncoats and the viral genome is translated into a single polyprotein that is co-and post-translationally processed into structural and nonstructural proteins by a combination of host peptidases and two viralencoded proteases. The HCV nonstructural proteins assemble as a replication complex onto modified intracellular membranes to replicate the HCV genome.

The resulting virus is released from the hepatocyte in association with host lipoproteins, such that in the blood HCV is present as a lipoprotein-coated virus 11 . During the viral replication process HCV is sensed as non-self by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) in the host cell that identify and bind to pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) motifs within viral products, leading to coordinated activation of the innate immune response and adaptive immune responses. Both the innate and adaptive arms of immunity, including cross-talk between liver-resident and infiltrating cells, such as hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, pDCs, natural killer (NK) cells, and other immune cells, contribute to the host's ability to resolve HCV infection [12] [13] [14] . However, despite these immune defenses HCV infection becomes chronic in about 70-80% of those who are acutely infected 2 . This outcome is due to a combination of host and viral factors that regulate the intracellular innate immune response against HCV. Importantly, inactivation of this intracellular innate immune response by HCV may also result in a non-functional adaptive immune response. Indeed, PRR signaling (specifically MAVS) is required for functional innate and adaptive responses during infection with West Nile virus, a related virus of the Flaviviridae family 15 . While outside of the scope of this perspective, a functional adaptive immune response is also critical to resolving HCV infection (reviewed in 14, 16 ).",

            "text": "A variety of PRRs sense viruses as foreign invaders within the host cell through specific PAMP recognition to activate innate immune signaling. The RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation antigen 5 (MDA5), are cytosolic PRRs that sense RNA viruses. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) mediate virus sensing from within endosomal compartments to signal innate defenses, while Nod-like receptors (NLRs) serve to sense cytosolic viral products or viral metabolites to drive inflammatory responses. Activation of these PRRs drives the innate antiviral and proinflammatory responses that limit virus replication and spread while also serving to recruit adaptive immune cells and enhance their effector actions at the site of infection. A variety of other nucleic acid binding proteins can also serve as putative PRRs where their engagement of viral nucleic acid results in their interaction with and regulation of specific PRR signaling pathways. Protein kinase R (PKR) is an example of these nontraditional PRRs, as its dsRNA binding activity promotes its interaction with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) impart PRR signaling of innate immunity [17] [18] We have shown that HCV is recognized by RIG-I within hours of infection and activates downstream signaling prior to extensive viral protein synthesis 19 . RIG-I signaling during HCV infection is initiated upon its binding of PAMP RNA that includes an exposed 5' triphosphate and the 3' non-translated region of the HCV genome RNA rich in poly U/UC ribonucleotides [20] [21] . This multi-component PAMP motif presents a non-self RNA signature that is detected by RIG-I to activate innate immunity. While the 5' triphosphate and poly U/UC region are at opposite ends of the viral genome, known intra-genome interactions between the 5' and 3' ends of the RNA 22 can bring both into proximity for RIG-I binding and activation by HCV replication intermediates. HCV PAMP could be presented to RIG-I either from incoming genomes after viral uncoating or during HCV genome amplification. HCV RNA binding induces a RIG-I conformational change that promotes oligomerization and translocation from the cytosol into intracellular membranes [23] [24] [25] . This process requires interactions with the chaperone protein 14-3-3\u03b5 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25, which together with RIG-I comprise a translocon that facilitates the interaction of RIG-I with the signaling adaptor protein MAVS 24, 26 . The RIG-I/MAVS interaction promotes the formation of a MAVS signalosome that propagates activation of downstream effector molecules, including the transcription factors IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB, and a variety of proinflammatory cytokines 27 (Fig. 1 ).",

Whereas synthetic dsRNA ligands of TLR3 can induce IRF-3 dependent signaling in cells expressing ectopic TLR3 within 24 hours 28 , HCV infection in these cells activates this signaling, including cytokine production, at later times (3-4 days) after infection 28, 32 . The TLR3 ligand of HCV has recently been identified as HCV dsRNA replication intermediates that accumulate late during HCV replication and interact with the dsRNA binding domain of TLR3 32 . It is unlikely that incoming viral genomes or early replication products serve as TLR3 ligands, as TLR3-based cytokine production requires several days to be induced. Instead, the HCV ligands of TLR3 are probably present either following uptake of extracellular HCV dsRNA (either from dying cells or from the extracellular milieu) by scavenger receptors on nearby uninfected cells 33 or by accumulation of dsRNA viral replication intermediates exposed to TLR3 in either the endosome or autophagic vesicles 34 . Therefore, during HCV infection TLR3-mediated signaling could serve as a secondary innate immune detection or surveillance system for uninfected cells after initial RIG-I detection of HCV, possibly involved in setting up an antiviral state within regions of the liver or chemokine induction for recruitment of T cells to the liver during HCV infection 32 .",

PKR is a dsRNA binding protein whose kinase activity can be induced by binding to HCV dsRNA to phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1) to suppress host mRNA translation, but not HCV translation because HCV uses an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) translation mechanism that is insensitive to the levels of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation that suppress Cap-dependent translation of host mRNAs [36] [37] [38] [39] . It is now known that PKR binding to HCV dsRNA also activates a kinase-independent signal transduction cascade that drives induction of specific ISGs and IFN-\u03b2 production by signaling through MAVS, TRAF3, IRFs, and NF-\u03baB, all prior to RIG-I activation [17] [18] 35 ( Fig. 1 ). The HCV ligand for PKR is the structured RNA at the IRES of the HCV RNA 35, 39 . While the mechanisms governing PKR and RIG-I signaling cross-talk are still being defined, these studies reveal a role for PKR as a PRR that can cooperate with RIG-I to drive downstream gene expression that mediates antiviral defenses.",

However, despite the effective non-self detection of HCV by RIG-I, TLR3, and PKR to trigger innate immune programs, as many as 80% of people with acute HCV infection do not effectively control the virus and develop a chronic infection 2 . This high frequency of chronic infection reflects the fact that HCV has evolved several mechanisms to evade and suppress innate immunity, resulting in HCV progression to chronicity (reviewed in 42 ) . The viral NS3/4A protease is a central component of the HCV innate immune evasion strategy. The multifunctional NS3/4A protease is required for HCV replication, during which it processes the HCV polyprotein at several sites to liberate the viral NS proteins 44 . The NS3/4A protease complex is anchored to intracellular membranes through the NS4A transmembrane domain and an amphipathic \u03b1-helix at the NS3 amino terminus that facilitates membrane association and cleavage of membrane-anchored substrates [45] [46] . NS3/4A can block RIG-I signaling, because in addition to proteolytically processing the HCV polyprotein, NS3/4A targets and cleaves MAVS from intracellular membranes to prevent signal transduction 19, [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] (Fig. 2) . As MAVS must be anchored to membranes for downstream signaling, this cleavage event prevents activation of the RIG-I pathway during acute infection, abrogates IFN induction, and supports the progression to chronic infection. However, we note that other hepatotropic viruses, including hepatitis A virus (HAV) and GB virus B (GVB-B), encode proteases that also cleave MAVS [52] [53] . While GVB-B can mediate a chronic infection in marmosets 54 , HAV does not generally become chronic. Thus MAVS cleavage is probably necessary but not sufficient for viral chronicity.",

However, we now know that the MAVS transmembrane domain also anchors the protein at diverse sites within an intracellular membrane network at peroxisomes and on mitochondrial-associated membranes (MAM), an ER membrane subdomain residing at junctions between the ER and mitochondria [57] [58] . The NS3/4A protease complex localizes to all of these membranes during HCV infection 58 . However, rather than cleaving MAVS from the outer mitochondrial membrane, NS3/4A targets and cleaves the MAM-localized MAVS. This process abrogates RIG-I signaling despite a level of intact MAVS remaining on the mitochondria 58 . Therefore, during HCV infection, the MAM-resident MAVS likely transduces RIG-I pathway signaling. Cleavage of MAVS during HCV infection has also been shown in vivo in the liver of patients with chronic HCV infection 19, 59 . Importantly, patients with cleaved MAVS exhibited lower levels of IFN pathway activation 59 . Thus, MAVS cleavage by the HCV NS3/4A protease disrupts RIG-I signaling of innate antiviral immunity and attenuates IFN production.",

PKR-mediated translational suppression of host mRNAs during HCV infection and IFN therapy can inhibit translation of host factors important for HCV replication and cellular growth (PKR functions as an antiviral molecule) but it also can inhibit translation of ISGs and IFN (PKR functions as a proviral molecule) [36] [37] . Furthermore, PKR-kinase independent signaling during HCV infection to activate specific ISGs and IFN-\u03b2 would be considered to be antiviral. We know that HCV has several PKRinactivation strategies, both at the level of PKR/PRR signaling (NS5A/E2 direct actions on PKR; NS3/4A cleavage of MAVS) and at the level of PKR-regulated translational inhibition (NS5A/E2 [62] [63] [64] ) that likely contribute to viral persistence and/or IFN therapy responses, but the exact mechanisms, timing, and how they would support this viral persistence are still unclear (Fig. 2) . It is possible that NS5A and E2 inactivation of PKR-translational suppression could function only at specific times during infection (for example, after NS3/4A suppression of MAVS-dependent signaling) to ensure the requisite synthesis of host factors required to maintain cellular growth, while supporting an environment for persistent HCV replication.",

IFN is an antiviral cytokine that induces the expression of hundreds of ISGs, many of which have antiviral or immunomodulatory activities that can limit virus replication and spread, as well as prime the adaptive immune response to HCV infection 65 . In fact, in acutely-infected patients, IFNtherapy is extremely successful at preventing chronic infection 66 . However, in chronically infected patients, the response to IFN-based therapies is variable, and many patients maintain high levels of HCV viremia in spite of IFN treatment. We propose that the low effectiveness of IFN therapy in those chronically infected with HCV is attributed to a combination of viral and host factors that contribute to regulation of IFN action and treatment-induced clearance (Fig. 3) . The viral factor that most highly predicts IFN treatment response is the viral genotype. There are 6 major HCV genotypes defined by their sequence conservation and variation that further divides them as subtypes and viral quasispecies 67 . Interestingly patients infected with different HCV genotypes have differential therapy responses. Patients infected with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 exhibit the highest response rates to therapy, with 70-80% of these patients achieving a sustained virologic response (SVR) while only 45-60% of patients with HCV genotype 1 or 4 infection achieve SVR (summarized in 68 ). Indeed, HCV genotypes 1 and 4 induce high levels of hepatic ISG expression in the infected patient liver before therapy resulting in an IFN-insensitive phenotype that attenuates treatment responses [69] [70] [71] .",

Further, why does HCV persist in the liver in spite of high levels of IFN signaling and elevated hepatic ISGs, many with known antiviral actions? Within the HCV-infected hepatocyte, HCV proteins, including Core, could be antagonizing IFN signaling through Jak-STAT pathway inactivation (reviewed in 42 ) or suppression of specific ISGs that could otherwise limit HCV infection (Fig. 3) . Additionally, there are known genotypic differences in HCV-mediated immune regulation that likely contribute to the observed differences in therapy responses. For example, NS5A and E2 from different genotypes differentially bind and regulate PKR, with the IFN-resistant viral genotypes being better able to block PKR function [62] [63] [64] . Importantly, the viral sequences encoding E2 (PePHD/PKR inhibitory domain) and NS5A (PKR binding domain) show the most evolution between HCV genotypes, supporting the idea that E2 and NS5A are potential determinants of genotype-specific clinical outcome 68 . In addition, differential levels of MAVS cleavage among HCV genotypes were found in the livers of HCV patients in which those with fully cleaved MAVS (genotypes 2 and 3) exhibited lower levels of pre-therapy ISG expression 59 . Interestingly, higher pre-therapy genetic variability of HCV within the major genotypes, especially within the sequences of Core, NS3, and NS5A, correlates with a more successful therapy outcome 72 . Taken together, this data suggests that alterations in the sequences of these viral regulatory factors lead to increased immune regulation during HCV infection. This increased immune regulation, while beneficial to the virus, would be predicted to prevent pre-therapy induction of ISGs and thereby make this virus more susceptible to HCV therapy.",

These SNPs associate with altered mRNA expression of IFNL3, which encodes the antiviral cytokine IFNL3, suggesting that IFNL3 expression levels are likely associated with HCV clearance and response to therapy [6] [7] 70 . We note that while several early studies failed to find altered mRNA expression of IFNL3 associated with these SNPs 74, 76 , as the specificity of real-time PCR primers for IFNL3 (that differentiate between IFNL3 and the closely related IFNL2) has increased, it is now clear that these identified SNPs in the IFNL3 locus do impact the expression of IFNL3 within the liver, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and whole blood [6] [7] 70, [77] [78] , with the minor/unfavorable allele/haplotype resulting in less in IFNL3 expression.",

The locations of the current candidate casual SNPs within the IFNL3 gene suggest possible regulatory mechanisms (see Fig. 4 ). As the SNPs in IFNL3 do appear to impact IFNL3 expression [6] [7] 70, [77] [78] 82 , it is unlikely that these SNPs are simply in linkage disequilibrium with some other gene involved in HCV pathogenesis. Defining how IFNL3 polymorphisms enhance HCV therapy response rates will be important for the development of new therapeutic strategies to suppress HCV through treatment with recombinant IFN-\u03bb and to better understand the role of IFNL3 in the host response to HCV infection. A recent study showed that patients with the unfavorable IFNL3 genotype have depressed innate immune function, particularly with respect to NK cells 83 , suggesting the decreased expression of IFNL3 affects immunity and therefore clearance of HCV.",

As IFNL4 only shares 29% homology with the other IFN-\u03bb genes and functions in a slightly different manner 84 , we will limit our discussion here to IFNL1-3. These cytokines have antiviral and immunomodulatory activity, similar to the type I IFNs. IFN-\u03bb signals through a receptor consisting of the IL10R2 and IFNLR1 subunits that converges on the Jak/STAT pathway, induces similar ISG profiles as type I IFN, and can inhibit HCV replication in vitro (reviewed in 86 ). However, the cellular producers and receptor proteins for type III IFN have a more limited distribution than type I IFN 87 , suggesting a more localized role for type III IFN in immunity. Interestingly, the kinetics of ISG induction varies between these cytokines, with IFN-\u03bb inducing a more sustained expression of ISGs than IFN-\u03b1 88 . Further, unlike IFN-\u03b1 IFN-\u03bb signaling does not become refractory to repeated applications 89 , and it can function cooperatively with type I IFN to impart enhanced ISG induction and antiviral activity 90 . Therefore, we could speculate that in the innate immune response to HCV, IFN-\u03bb provides a localized, sustained activation of ISGs in specific cell types in the infected liver, and primes an effective immune response, both at the innate and adaptive levels, for HCV clearance. In fact, IFN-\u03bb has emerged as new candidate for HCV therapy with lower side effects than IFN-\u03b1 treatment 86 , likely due to its restricted receptor distribution. It is still not clear why the genetic polymorphisms associated with natural and therapy-induced control of HCV are found specifically in IFNL3 (and now IFNL4), and not within the IFNL1 or IFNL2 loci, and why IFNL3 specifically would play such a key role in the host response to HCV. More studies aimed at understanding how these very similar genes are activated and regulated during HCV infection, as well as determining both the cell types of production and the mechanism of induction of the IFN-\u03bb cytokines during HCV infection are needed. In particular, new studies need to continue to carefully discriminate between the virtually indistinguishable IFNL2 and IFNL3 genes, both at the protein and mRNA levels. Moreover, there is a need to actually demonstrate the expression IFNL4 (both protein and mRNA levels) and its regulation in patients, as well to understand the relationship of IFNL4 on impacting levels of IFNL3. Only then will we have a foundation of understanding of the role of the IFN-\u03bb cytokines in HCV immune control and response to therapy in the liver.",

Therefore, other factors must contribute to a successful outcome of therapy. In fact, the strongest predictor of response to therapy is dictated by the pretreatment expression pattern of ISG mRNA within the liver [69] [70] 91 . Patients with pre-therapy induction of ISG mRNA in hepatocytes achieve the lowest therapy response rates. While we do not know why this correlates to lower therapy response rates, it is possible that the pre-therapy induction of ISGs prevents further induction of ISG levels by IFN-\u03b1 during therapy due to activation of negative regulators leading to refractoriness to signaling 89 , or that PKR translational suppression of ISGs prevents their effector function, precluding effective therapy responses 37,89 (see Fig. 2 ). Interestingly, in Kupffer cells, the resident liver macrophages, the pre-therapy induction level of ISGs is also a strong predictor of therapy response 71 . In Kupffer cells, the phenotype is opposite of that seen in hepatocytes, with virtually all nonresponders lacking pre-therapy induction of ISGs, while responders have strongly-induced ISGs 91 . This suggests that during HCV infection, Kupffer cells (activated to induce ISGs, either by cytokine signaling or through phagocytosis and sensing of viral products 75,92-93 ; Fig. 5 ) may play a key protective role for the host in both therapy responses and HCV clearance. Understanding how macrophages are activated and interact with hepatocytes for immune control during HCV infection and treatment will play a key role in determining the mechanisms driving this phenotype, as well as HCV pathogenesis.",

It is known that host genetic differences, as well as HCV-induced ISG expression profiles in liver cell subtypes can predict therapy responses. However, they are often independent predictors of therapy responses meaning that the patient IFNL3 genotype cannot definitively predict the hepatic ISG activation state 70, 91, 94 . Thus, the ISG expression profile of hepatocytes and macrophages is still the single best predictor of therapy response, where virtually all patients that lack pre-induced hepatic ISGs respond to therapy while those who lack pre-induced macrophage ISGs fail therapy 91 . Therefore, the host genotype at IFNL3 or other host loci and viral genotype likely predispose the HCV infected patient to a particular therapy response outcome but it is a combination of factors, including cross-talk between liver cell subtypes and environmental factors (such as age, race, sex), which ultimately dictates the response to therapy (Fig. 3B ).",

            "text": "The hepatic pre-therapy ISG mRNA expression profiles of some patients with chronic HCV infection indicates that IFN (either Type I or Type III) is being produced endogenously during infection. The cell type of Type I or Type III IFN production could be the infected cell as well as bystander cells responding to virus exposure 33, 75, 95 . Importantly, the fact that patients with the favorable IFNL3 SNPs generally have higher levels of IFNL3 and lower pre-therapy hepatic ISG levels, but higher macrophage ISG levels 91 , suggest that other cell types within the liver besides the infected hepatocytes could be producing the IFN. Further, production of Type I and/or Type III IFN or response to the IFN at the level of the receptor or downstream signaling in the infected hepatocyte is likely regulated by HCV infection itself. We know this is the case for Type 1 IFN, and it is quite possible that this is also true for IFNL3 (see Figs. 2 and 3) . Here, we propose a number of virus/host interactions in the context of the liver that could drive the hepatic production of IFN and proinflammatory cytokines (Fig. 5) . Before viral proteins accumulate during infection, HCV activation of RIG-I and/or PKR actions in hepatocytes can stimulate IRF-3 activation, leading to an early, albeit transient, induction of IFN-\u03b2 and ISG expression [35] [36] 96 . HCV can also induce type III IFN in primary liver cultures [97] [98] . Resident or infiltrating liver myeloid cells, including plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and Kupffer cells, could produce type I or III IFN after stimulation by viral products from neighboring infected hepatocytes. In particular, exosomal transfer of HCV RNA from hepatocytes to neighboring pDCs can stimulate high level type I and type III IFN production through TLR7, as well as through RIG-I signaling 95, 99 , while Kupffer cells may be able to phagocytose HCV 92 to stimulate local type I and III IFN production. While this local production of IFN could serve an obvious antiviral function for suppression of acute HCV infection, the chronic production of IFN (particularly IFN-\u03b1) also regulates ISG expression and antiviral function that limits the efficacy of both the local hepatic IFN and IFN therapy 69, 89 . During HCV infection, cytokines produced by pDCs, Kupffer cells, and infected hepatocytes within the liver could also impact the recruitment of immune cells to the liver, including myeloid cells, NK cells, and T cells. HCV regulation of this cytokine induction could play a key regulatory role in dictating activation of these immune cells for an effective adaptive immune response to HCV, resulting in changes in HCV-induced pathogenesis and varying outcomes of IFN therapy 14 . This cross talk between liver cell subtypes would be expected to be influenced by the patient IFNL3 genotype, with those with the favorable genotype having increased immune cell function and better viral clearance, as has been suggested 83 . Understanding the cross talk between liver cell subtypes is now key to defining the complex nature of both type I and type III IFN actions, priming of the adaptive immune response, especially generation of virus-specific CTLs, therapy outcome, and HCV suppression.",

            "text": "While the immune response can clear HCV 43 , virus exposure often carries forward into a chronic infection. Chronic HCV is linked to dysregulation of innate and adaptive immune signaling and viral-induced cytotoxicity/apoptosis in the hepatic environment which together affect infection outcome, response to therapy, and likely contribute to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. HCV accomplishes this immune dysregulation by evading the host innate immune response at multiple points, to prevent the initial coordination of innate immunity that primes the entire immune response, including adaptive immunity, leading to increased viral replication and contributing to viral persistence. Within the liver microenvironment, multiple cell types contribute to the immune response towards HCV, and interruption of any aspect of the innate response by HCV could lead to an unbalanced, ineffective immune response, both in natural and treatment-induced HCV clearance, that could drive the progression to liver disease. A full understanding of how viral immune modulation imparts infection outcome requires us to define the spectrum of antiviral and immunomodulatory cytokines that govern the cross-talk between the various cell types within the complex liver tissue. For example, how do IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb responses crosstalk to one another and with hepatic responses to proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IP10, and others, implicated in hepatic inflammation? What are the key producer cells for these cytokines in the infected liver, and how is production of these cytokines stimulated and/or regulated during HCV infection? There may also be a role for hepatic stellate cells in mediating some of these processes as they have recently been implicated in driving inflammatory responses during HCV-infection of hepatocytes 100 .",

The activation of these cells is required to prime the adaptive immune response to HCV, which plays a major role in eventual viral clearance 16 . Both type I and type III IFN can act on uninfected hepatocytes to induce an antiviral state that limits virus spread. In the infected cell, HCV can evade IFN induction through viral-mediated processes, including NS3/4A-mediated cleavage of MAVS and TRIF, impacting HCV outcome of infection and disease progression. Cross-talk between hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells during HCV infection has also been shown to induce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (not depicted here) 100 .",
