            "text": "Prion diseases are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by an aggregation of abnormal prion protein (PrP Sc ) 8 . Since PrP Sc itself seems to be an infectious agent and the protein is host-encoded, acquired immunity against prion disease should not be possible. Conversely, we previously demonstrated that IRF-3 plays a crucial role in the host's defense mechanism against prion infection. Disrupted IRF-3 genes developed prion diseases earlier compared to wild-type mice after inoculation. Overexpression of IRF-3 significantly reduced the amount of abnormal prion protein in persistently infected cells, indicating that IRF-3 expression levels are closely related to the anti-prion state of the host cell 9, 10 . Although the innate immune responses against prion invasion are insufficient to stop disease progression, involvement of IRF-3 inducible factors such as IFN-I may be one of the reasons why prion infection shows an extremely long incubation period. It would be of great benefit to understand how IRF-3 inducible factors inhibit prion infection and how prions avoid this host-defense system. Lowther et al. reported that a sufficient basal promoter activity of human IRF-3 was found in the upstream region (nucleotides: nt; -113 to -1) of the transcription start site 11 , however, the mechanism of the transcriptional regulation of IRF-3 remains largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed murine IRF-3 promoter activity in detail and its relationship to prion infection, and have shown that the octamer-binding transcription factor-1 (Oct-1) positively regulates murine IRF-3, and the expression levels of Oct-1 decreased in prion-infected cells.",

As shown in Fig. 1 , a plasmid containing nt -1000 to -1 relative to the transcription start site (pGL3 -1000/-1) showed approximately 33-fold (in N2a cells) and 6-fold (in 3T3 cells) activity compared with the control (pGL3 Basic), while plasmids containing nt -2000 to -1001 (pGL3 -2000/-1001) and nt -1000 to -524 (pGL3 -1000/-524) completely lost their responsiveness. Plasmids containing nt -523 to -1 (pGL3 -523/-1), nt -340 to -1 (pGL3 -340/-1) and nt -119 to -1 (pGL3 -119/-1) maintained similar levels of their promoter activity with the full-length promoter (pGL3 -1000/-1), suggesting that nt -119 to -1 was responsible for the promoter activity.",

The significantly reduced promoter activity in ScN2a58 cells increased after continuous treatment with Congo red (CR, 10 mM) or pentosan polysulfate (PPS, 20 mg/ml), which are both known as anti-prion drugs 12 (Fig. 2c ; CR: 3.8-fold and PPS: 3.4-fold).

We identified putative transcription factor binding sites in nt -119 to -1 with the software TFSEARCH ver.1.3 (http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/ TFSEARCH.html) and found that this region contains a potential Oct-1 binding site (59-ATTTGCAT-39, nt -42 to -35) and an acute myeloid leukemia 1 protein (AML1) binding site (59-TGCGGT-39, nt -49 to -44). In addition, an E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) binding site (59-TTTCCCAC-39, nt -116 to -109) was also conserved in murine (Fig. 3a) . To determine whether the Oct-1 site is important for promoter activity, an original and two different mutated plasmids from the Oct-1 site (M1 and M2) were prepared (Fig. 3b ) and the transiently transfected into N2a and 3T3 cells. After 24 h, we evaluated their respective promoter activity by reporter assay. The activities of pGL3 -119/-1 (M1) were also significantly reduced compared with the original promoter activities in N2a and 3T3 cells ( Fig. 3c and 3d ). The activities of pGL3 -1000/-1 (M1) and pGL3 -523/-1 (M1) were also significantly reduced ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). We obtained similar results in the second mutated plasmid pGL3 -119/-1 (M2) where activity was also significantly reduced in N2a and 3T3 cells ( Fig. 3e and 3f) . These results indicate that the Oct-1 site might play a crucial role for murine IRF-3 promoter activity. We next determined whether the E2F1 site was important for the promoter activity. The original plasmid pGL3 -119/-1 and the E2F1 site mutated plasmid (M3: Fig. 3g ) were transiently transfected into N2a and 3T3 cells. After 24 h, we evaluated their respective promoter activity by reporter assay. The activities of pGL3 -119/-1 (M3) were not significantly different compared to the original plasmid promoter activity in N2a and 3T3 cells ( Fig. 3h and 3i) , indicating the E2F1 is not an important determining factor for the regulation of murine IRF-3 promoter. Since two different mutations in the AML1 site (M4 and M5: shown in Supplementary Fig. S4a ) had little effect on the promoter activity in N2a58 cells (N2a cells overexpress wild-type prion protein), indicating the AML1 is not also important ( Supplementary  Fig. S4b ).",

Furthermore, to investigate whether the promoter activity is affected by Oct-1, pcDNA Oct-1-HA and pGL3 -119/-1 were co-transfected into N2a cells. Ectopically Oct-1 overexpression significantly increased the original promoter activities (pGL3 -119/-1 1 mock vs pGL3 -119/-1 1 pcDNA Oct-1-HA), while Oct-1 expression had no effect on the mutated promoter activities [pGL3 -119/-1 (M1) 1 mock vs pGL3 -119/-1 (M1) 1 pcDNA Oct-1-HA], indicating exogenous Oct-1 functions in the promoter region (Fig. 4b) .",

We intracerebrally inoculated 22L or FK-1 prion strains into ddY mice and analyzed the levels of Oct-1 protein in their brains after becoming terminal, respectively. Of note, the levels of Oct-1 protein in the two distinct prion strains-infected mouse brains significantly decreased, suggesting that prion infection might repress endogenous Oct-1 expression ( Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. S6c ).

It has been shown that E2F1 negatively regulates human IRF-3 gene expression 13 . Although the E2F1 site was also present in the murine promoter, the E2F1 site mutation had little effect on promoter activity ( Fig. 3h and 3i ). Mach et al. have shown that Oct-1 also bound to the human IRF-3 promoter 14 . Importantly, the putative transcription factor binding sites in 59 flanking region are very similar between human and murine IRF-3 promoter (Supplementary Fig. S5 ). However, the contribution of Oct-1 in human IRF-3 promoter remains controversial and elusive. In our experimental study, mutations in the Oct-1 binding site lost their promoter activity (Fig. 3c to 3f) and exogenous Oct-1 enhanced the activity (Fig. 4b) . In conclusion, Oct-1 positively regulates the IRF-3 promoter activity, while E2F1 and AML1 are not involved in murine IRF-3 gene regulation. Intriguingly, Oct-1 expression was significantly reduced in two distinct prion strains-infected cells and mice brains ( Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S6 ). Although we are not able to exclude yet the possibility that the accumulation of abnormal prion protein may directly impair the function of Oct-1, prion infection might alter the expression of Oct-1 as a result of its destructive effect on protein synthesis in the host cell. It has recently been reported that prion infection could impair the host's ability to synthesize protein by means of inhibition of double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-dependent eIF-2a phosphorylation 15, 16 . Another study revealed that the global alteration of gene expression has occurred in prion-infected mouse brains by unknown mechanisms 17 .",
