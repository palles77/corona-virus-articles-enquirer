Multiple types of stress decrease parkin protein levels, an effect that may be relevant to sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), but the mechanism(s) involved in this loss remain largely unclear. We sought to elucidate these mechanisms using a PD-relevant stressor, L-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine, which forms reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as toxic quinones via auto-oxidation. We find that L-DOPA causes parkin loss through both an oxidative stress-independent and an oxidative stress-dependent pathway. Characterization of the latter reveals that it requires both the kinase PINK1 and parkin's interaction with phosphorylated ubiquitin (phospho-Ub) and is mediated by proteasomal degradation.",

During stress induced by the oxidative stressor hydrogen peroxide or the metabolic uncoupler CCCP, parkin degradation also requires its association with phospho-Ub, indicating that this mechanism is broadly generalizable. As oxidative stress, metabolic dysfunction and phospho-Ub levels are all elevated in PD patients, we suggest that these changes may lead to the loss of parkin expression in PD.",

Though most cases of PD appear to be \"sporadic\", a minority of cases have a clear autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance pattern [2] . The most common known cause of autosomal recessive PD is homozygous inactivation of PARK2, which encodes the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin [3] . Parkin has been demonstrated to promote cell survival in many different contexts [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . There is also evidence that parkin loss may play a role in the pathogenesis of sporadic PD [21] [22] [23] . As such, strategies aimed at upregulating parkin levels or maintaining it in an active state hold therapeutic promise for sporadic PD [16] , [24] [25] [26] .",

This loss is generally thought to be linked to the process of parkin-mediated mitophagy [36] [37] [38] [39] , though one study has suggested that parkin's autoubiquitination leads to its degradation and prevents mitophagy following mitochondrial depolarization [40] . The degree to which parkin loss from mitochondrial depolarization aligns mechanistically with parkin loss from other stressors is uncertain. One possible contributor in common is the mitochondrial kinase PINK1, that parkin's association with phospho-Ub generated by other stressors also leads to parkin degradation, suggesting that this mechanism is broadly-generalizable. Surprisingly, we find that parkin loss downstream of its association with phospho-Ub does not appear to require canonical mitochondrial parkin activity or mitophagy.",

To test whether conversion of L-DOPA to dopamine is required for its effect on parkin, we used carbidopa to block the activity of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), the enzyme responsible for this conversion. As anticipated, 200 \u00b5M L-DOPA treatment alone for 16-24 hours significantly increased intracellular dopamine levels (to 3.0 \u00b1 0.4 fold over control levels, p = 0.02, N = 5) (Fig. 2B ). Co-treatment with carbidopa robustly diminished this effect (to 1.1 \u00b1 0.3 fold over control levels, p = 0.02 vs. L-DOPA alone, N = 5) but did not impact the loss of parkin from L-DOPA treatment (30.9 \u00b1 5.9% parkin loss with L-DOPA alone vs. 31.4 \u00b1 4.7% loss with L-DOPA + carbidopa, p = 0.9, N = 4) (Fig. 2C) . These results suggest that autoxidation of L-DOPA itself, rather than its conversion to dopamine, is the source of the oxidative stress that leads to parkin loss following L-DOPA treatment in our system. Consistent with this possibility, we observed \"browning\" of the cell culture medium after 8 24 hours of exposure to L-DOPA, even in the absence of cells (Fig. S6) , which has been shown to be a result of quinone formation from L-DOPA autoxidation [61] , [64] [65] [66] .",

To assess this, we examined S65-phosphorylated ubiquitin (phospho-Ub) as a readout of PINK1 activity. At baseline, phospho-Ub is present at very low or undetectable levels in cells [69] , [70] . Following mitochondrial depolarization, PINK1 becomes stabilized on the outer mitochondrial membrane and activated, leading it to phosphorylate ubiquitin and resulting in an accumulation of phosphorylated poly-ubiquitin chains (phospho-poly-Ub) that is detectable by Western blotting [69] , [70] . As expected, we observed little phospho-Ub in untreated PC12 cells (Fig. 3C) . As a positive control for PINK1 activation and phospho-Ub induction, we treated cells with the protonophore carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), which is widely used as a mitochondrial depolarizing agent [71] . Following CCCP treatement, we observed the appearance of high molecular weight phospho-Ub ladders, consistent with formation of phosphopoly-Ub chains (Fig. 3C ). Treatment of cells with L-DOPA also led to formation of phosphopoly-Ub (Fig. 3C) , although the strength of the L-DOPA-induced phospho-poly-Ub signal was about 10 times weaker than that induced by CCCP (p = 0.04, N = 3 for L-DOPA and 4 for CCCP) (Fig. 3C,D) . We did not observe the formation of unconjugated mono-phospho-Ub after L-DOPA treatment (Fig. 3C) . Knockdown of PINK1 strongly attenuated the phospho-poly-Ub signal from CCCP exposure (to 27.5 \u00b1 5.1% of sh-ctrl, p = 0.003, N = 4), and caused a similar downward trend in the L-DOPA-induced phospho-poly-Ub signal (to 40.5 \u00b1 16.3% of sh-ctrl, p = 0.07, N = 3), indicating that PINK1 indeed appears to be involved in generating this signal ( Fig. 3E ,F). Together, these results indicate that L-DOPA exposure leads to PINK1 activation, albeit to a lesser extent than CCCP exposure, and that this activation contributes to parkin loss.",

We reasoned that parkin phosphorylation, parkin binding to L-DOPA-induced phospho-Ub, or both of these events may underlie PINK1-mediated parkin loss. To determine the relative importance of these events, we introduced several point mutations in the \"moderately\" overexpressed exogenous parkin construct described above (Fig.   S4A ). To test the importance of parkin phosphorylation, we generated a S65A parkin mutant. To test the importance of phospho-Ub binding to parkin, we generated parkin mutants H302A and K151E. Both of the latter mutations significantly abrogate the interaction between parkin and phospho-Ub, although K151E has been demonstrated to be more effective in this regard [47] . We delivered the parkin mutants to PC12 cells via lentiviral transduction and tested their responses to L-DOPA treatment. Although the viral titers between constructs varied slightly due to inherent variability in the viral production process, we found that all parkin mutants used in this study were expressed at similar levels (i.e. ~8-fold higher than endogenous parkin) in cells when controlling for titer (Fig. S7 ).",

This suggests that the contribution of PINK1 to L-DOPA-mediated parkin loss may be fully accounted for by parkin's interaction with PINK1-generated phospho-Ub. In agreement with this, the S65A parkin mutant was not at all protected from L-DOPA-induced loss compared to wild-type parkin (S65A: 36.8 \u00b1 3.6% loss, N = 4, p = 0.82) (Fig. 4A,B) , indicating that PINK1-mediated parkin phosphorylation is not .

            "text": "The above findings indicate that parkin's interaction with phospho-Ub is required for a portion of its loss following L-DOPA treatment, while parkin phosphorylation appears to be dispensable. However, one potential reservation for this interpretation is that our mutant parkin constructs have an N-terminal tag to differentiate them from endogenous parkin, and such tags have been reported to disrupt parkin's autoinhibited conformation by opening the Ubl domain [80] . Because parkin phosphorylation is also reported to open the Ubl domain [45] , [73] , [81] [82] [83] [84] , we wished to ensure that the effect of parkin phosphorylation was not made functionally redundant by the presence of the tag. To do so, we took advantage of the finding that parkin phosphorylation is required for full parkin activation in response to CCCP [49] , [77] . We compared the levels of CCCP-induced phospho-poly-Ub in cells transduced with either wildtype or S65A parkin. We reasoned that since parkin phosphorylation contributes to its activation and since such activation leads to phospho-poly-Ub formation following mitochondrial depolarization [50] , we would expect to see decreased levels of phospho-poly-Ub in CCCP- 4A) suggest that parkin loss from L-DOPA treatment occurs via two distinct pathways, and that oxidative stress and PINK1 activity each play a role in only one of these pathways. To determine whether the oxidative stress-dependent (glutathione-sensitive) and the phospho-Ub-dependent mechanisms of parkin loss are in the same pathway, we investigated whether glutathione can abrogate the phospho-Ub signal induced by L-DOPA. Given that the majority of this signal is present in high molecular weight phospho-poly-Ub conjugates, we examined the effect of glutathione on phospho-poly-Ub. We found that glutathione prevented L-DOPA-induced phospho-poly-Ub formation almost completely (no treatment: 28.6 \u00b1 7.8% phospho-poly-Ub relative to L-DOPA treatment, p = 0.002, N = 5; L-DOPA + GSH: 37.6 \u00b1 5.6% relative to L-DOPA treatment, p = 0.002, N = 5) (Fig. 4C) . Additionally, hydrogen peroxide exposure induced phospho-poly-Ub formation (Fig. 4D) . These results indicate that oxidative stress from L-DOPA exposure leads to PINK1 activation and that this in turn leads to the formation of phospho-Ub, its association with parkin, and parkin loss.

            "text": "In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which stressors, L-DOPA in particular, decrease cellular levels of parkin protein. We found that L-DOPA causes parkin loss via two distinct pathways: an oxidative stress-dependent pathway driven by L-DOPA autoxidation and an oxidative stress-independent pathway, each of which is responsible for about half of parkin loss (Fig. 11 ). We conclude that oxidative stress plays a role in only one of these pathways because parkin mutants deficient in binding phospho-Ub were only partly protected from L-DOPA-induced loss, whereas they were fully protected from loss induced by the oxidative stressor hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, exposure to the antioxidant glutathione, which is critical for neuronal defense against ROS [105] , only attenuated L-DOPA-induced parkin loss by half. Although glutathione lacks membrane permeability [106] , [107] and does not react efficiently with all kinds of ROS [108] , glutathione treatment has been previously shown to be effective at completely preventing the autoxidation of both L-DOPA and the dopamine analog 6hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to their respective quinones [109] , [110] . Additionally, glutathione treatment has been found to completely prevent cell death induced by L-DOPA [109] , 6-OHDA [110] , dopamine [111] [112] [113] , hydrogen peroxide [110] , and the oxidant nitric oxide [114] . In support of glutathione's capacity to prevent L-DOPA-induced oxidative stress in our hands, we observed an almost complete abrogation of L-DOPA-induced phospho-poly-Ub formation upon glutathione treatment. Nevertheless, it's possible that not all aspects of L-DOPA-induced oxidative stress were fully neutralized by glutathione in our model, which would have led us to underestimate the contribution of oxidative stress to parkin loss.

The finding that S65A parkin was not protected from loss induced by any of the stressors we used was unexpected because phosphorylation of S65 increases the binding affinity of parkin for phospho-Ub [46] , [47] , [79] , [81] . Given the importance of phospho-Ub binding for parkin loss, we anticipated that S65A parkin would exhibit greater protection from stressinduced degradation due to a lower affinity for phospho-Ub. On the contrary, both wild-type and S65A parkin were equally depleted under the conditions of our studies, though we cannot rule out the possibility that wild-type parkin is lost more rapidly in response to stress than the S65A",

One possibility is that the conformational change in parkin that occurs upon binding phospho-Ub [45] [46] [47] , [81] , [115] makes it vulnerable to degradation. If this is the case, the conformational change must be specific to phospho-Ub binding and not to that induced by parkin phosphorylation, because we show that only phospho-Ub binding is important for parkin loss. Both events have been proposed to release parkin's Ubl domain from its interaction with the RING1 domain [45] [46] [47] , [81] , [116] , and both have also The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/484857 doi: bioRxiv preprint been shown to facilitate the access of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to parkin's E2 binding site [46] , [74] . Accordingly, neither of these effects is likely to be the crucial conformational change involved in parkin degradation. Instead, a conformational change that may promote parkin loss is movement of the IBR domain away from the Ubl domain. This movement has, thus far, only been attributed to phospho-Ub binding [47] , [115] , [117] , [118] , raising it as a plausible candidate trigger for parkin loss. Alternatively, instead of inducing a critical conformational change, parkin's association with phospho-Ub may cause parkin loss by bringing it into proximity with proteins that promote its degradation.",

As such, finding ways to uncouple parkin's association with phospho-Ub from its degradation may be an attractive therapeutic avenue for PD treatment.

In time-course analyses, unpaired t-tests at each time point followed by Holm-Sidak's multiple comparisons test were used. For analysis of differences between parkin mutants, one-way ANOVA of stressor-treated mutants was performed, followed by Holm-Sidak correction for multiple comparisons. Differentiated PC12 cells were transduced for 3 to 6 days with lentiviral vectors carrying the indicated parkin mutants and bicistronically expressed GFP before cells were harvested for Western immunoblotting. Representative blots are shown. To compare relative expression levels of the different parkin mutants, parkin levels for each construct were normalized first to ERK1 and 2 to control for loading differences and then to GFP to control for variability in viral titer. The results of this quantification are shown on the right. Error bars show SEM from 5-10 independent experiments; * p \u2264 0.05 relative to WT by paired t-test with Holm correction for multiple comparisons. Figure 5 . Association with phospho-Ub leads to parkin loss from CCCP treatment A,B. Differentiated PC12 cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying the indicated parkin mutants. Three to five days after infection, cells were treated with 10 \u03bcM CCCP for 6 (A) or 12 (B) hours before harvest for Western immunoblotting and assessment of parkin protein levels. Representative immunoblots and quantifications of parkin levels are shown. The level of each parkin mutant after CCCP treatment was normalized to the level of the same mutant after control treatment, which was set to 1 in each case. The latter is represented by the leftmost gray bar in the quantifications.

Model of L-DOPA-induced parkin loss L-DOPA decreases parkin via two pathways: oxidative stress-dependent and -independent. The mechanism of the latter pathway remains unclear. The former pathway results from L-DOPA autoxidation, which induces PINK1 stabilization on the mitochondrial outer membrane. PINK1 phosphorylates polyubiquitin chains in both the cytosol and on mitochondria, though it's unclear to which substrate protein(s) these poly-ubiquitin chains are conjugated (indicated by single question marks in the model). Parkin associates with these phospho-poly-Ub chains, but does not itself build ubiquitin chains on mitochondrial proteins. Following its association with phospho-poly-Ub, parkin is degraded via the proteasome independently of autoubiquitination and mitophagy.

These results parkin phosphorylation plays a functional role in the CCCP model and is not made redundant by the presence of an N-terminal tag. In light of this, our observation that the S65A parkin mutant is not at all protected from L-DOPA-induced loss indicates that parkin phosphorylation status does not impact this loss. Instead, PINK1-mediated ubiquitin phosphorylation is required for PINK1-dependent parkin loss downstream of L-DOPA exposure. L-DOPA-induced oxidative stress-and phospho-Ub-dependent mechanisms of parkin loss are in the same pathway The findings that glutathione treatment, PINK1 knockdown, and mutation of parkin's phospho-Ub binding site all rescued L-DOPA-induced parkin loss by about 50% (Figs. 2A, 3B,",
