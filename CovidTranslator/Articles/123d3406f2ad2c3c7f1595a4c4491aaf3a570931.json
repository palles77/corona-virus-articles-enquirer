            "text": "S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was recently identified as a new clinical entity (1) . SARS likely originated in the Guangdong Province of People's Republic of China (2) and subsequently spread worldwide as infected persons traveled. During the 2003 outbreak, SARS was primarily transmitted by person-to-person contact between healthcare workers or household members and ill patients (2) . Community transmission also occurred in several of the most affected areas, and an explosive outbreak from a common source occurred in Amoy Garden in Hong-Kong (3) . As of June 2003, a total of 8,477 probable cases and 811 deaths had been reported from 32 countries (4) . A novel coronavirus has been identified as the cause of SARS (5) (6) (7) . Based on current knowledge, SARS is transmitted from symptomatic patients by close direct or indirect contacts through respiratory droplet secretions (2) . In specific situations, other modes of transmission, such as airborne spread, may be possible (8) . The incubation period ranges from 2 to 10 days, allowing SARS to spread over long distances by infected persons who travel (8, 9) .",

After performing clinical and Introduction of SARS in France, March-April, 2003 biologic evaluation and chest x-ray, the attending clinician notified the Institut de Veille Sanitaire through a unique telephone number. On the basis of the results of the initial and subsequent evaluations, each notified case was either discharged, kept as a suspect case, or classified as a probable case using the WHO SARS case definition (10, 11) . Probable and suspected case-patients were kept in isolation until recovery or until the diagnosis was changed, respectively. For this investigation, a probable case of SARS was defined as previously described (12) .",

RNA extraction and RT-PCR mixes were prepared in designated rooms. RT-PCR procedures included appropriate negative and positive controls in each run: two negative controls for the extraction procedure and one water control and one positive control for each PCR run. Two RT-PCR, either both nested or one nested and one real-time, were performed for each sample. Real-time RT-PCR, using the SARS-CoV detection kit from Artus (Germany), included an internal control that detected PCR inhibitory substances. One-step nested RT-PCR targeting either the Bernhard Nocht Institute (BNI) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) fragment of the polymerase gene was used (7, 13) . When real-time RT-PCR was performed, which targets the BNI fragment, the other RT-PCR was the nested RT-PCR targeting the CDC fragment of the polymerase gene. The real-time and nested RT-PCR, which targeted the BNI fragment reliably, detected 10 copies of RNA in the assay corresponding to 800 RNA molecules per milliliter of specimen.",

RT-PCR on nasal and pharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV.

Therefore, all casepatients were identified early in the course of the disease and placed under isolation, which contributed to reduction in the risk of secondary transmission and diffusion (16) . Only four of the five probable cases were confirmed either by RT-PCR or serologic testing, although all five met the probable SARS case definition. Although specific, the sensitivity of the RT-PCR-based detection technique remains to be fully evaluated (7) . In addition, the time at which respiratory specimens were taken could account for the fact that virus shedding remained undetected for one patient (patient D).",

Four contacts of SARS cases had an episode of transient, mild or low-grade fever without other signs, including three healthcare workers of the hospital where patient D had been admitted and the passenger seated next to patient A during the AF171 flight.

For patient B, we cannot formally exclude an unrecognized community exposure in Hanoi during the 10 days before departure. However, the fact that the SARS outbreak was controlled quite rapidly (17) , without any formal documentation of community transmission, a large unrecognized community transmission most likely did not occur. Patient B, in addition to sitting within two rows of patient A, had contact with patient A when he moved to and from the lavatory (at least four close contacts while going and coming at least twice from the lavatory). Although a precise date of fever onset is not available for patient A, it appears that he was already symptomatic in the plane and was likely infectious. This finding is based on the following evidence: 1) some persons who had met him in Hanoi before his departure reported that he had fatigue and fits of cough; 2) the passengers closest to him on the plane reported that he was dyspneic; and 3) his initial evaluation at admission to hospital on March 23 showed bilateral extended interstitial pneumonia and hypoxemia. The last strongly supports the hypothesis that his illness was ongoing for 3 to 8 days (1, 5, 8) .",

He had been traveling to Thailand, a country where local transmission has never been reported by WHO (18). Although airborne transmission on the plane cannot be ruled out, a possible hypothesis is an undocumented direct or indirect contact with patient A while boarding or on the plane. Our investigation also indicates that the risk for acquiring SARS after a contact with a symptomatic case is very heterogeneous, since prolonged contact does not necessarily result in transmission and, conversely, a brief or distant exposure might be sufficient. Factors that may explain this observation are the following: 1) the virus excretion varies over time, 2) the susceptibility to the SARS-CoV may vary among persons exposed, and 3) exposure results in asymptomatic infection.",

Numbers and letters in bold indicate seat lanes and rows, respectively. Patient A occupied seat 26L (next to the window). Seats of close passengers who were followed-up for 10 days are indicated by an X. They included two passengers who sat in the row ahead (25K and 25J, there was no seat at 25L), two passengers who occupied seats 26K and 26J, and three passengers who sat in the row behind (27J, 27K, and 27L). A row with no seats separated row 27 from row 28; a partition separated row 25 from the rest of the cabin. Consequently, passengers seated in rows 28 and 24 were excluded. The lavatories are indicated (WC). Patients A and B used the front lavatory (WC 1 ) while patient C used the one in the back (WC 4 ).
