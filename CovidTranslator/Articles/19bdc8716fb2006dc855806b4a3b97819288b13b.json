The most frequently documented causative pathogens of CAP are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Legionella pneumophila. 1e3 Evidence of viral infection has been detected in 15%e56% of cases, mainly by influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses and adenovirus. 4 Notably, CAP was one of the most frequent complications of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 infection during the pandemic period. In addition, it was associated with high morbidity and mortality. 5, 6 The reported incidence of pneumonia in hospitalised patients with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 infection was 23%e66%, 7e9 with primary viral pneumonia being the main cause of admission to intensive care units. 10, 11 Similarly, bacterial co-infection was associated with worse prognosis. 7, 12 Knowledge of the predominant microbial patterns in CAP is the basis for initial decisions about its empirical antimicrobial treatment. 3 Importantly, influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 continues to circulate as a seasonal virus after the pandemic period. It is therefore crucial to determine the microbial patterns and outcomes in CAP in the post-pandemic influenza seasons. 13 In addition, although Bewick et al. 14 developed a scoring system for identifying patients with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09-related pneumonia, this has not been validated to date.",

A multivariate logistic analysis, including significant variables in univariate analysis and clinically important variables, was performed to detect factors associated with severe disease. The relative risks were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI. The possibility of multicollinearity among variables was measured by means of correlation coefficient matrix. A value of 0.75 or higher among variables were considered as multicollinearity. Calibration of the model was evaluated by the goodness-of-fit according to the Hos-mereLemeshow test.

We also found a relatively high percentage of Gram-negative bacilli (2.2%) and Staphylococcus aureus (1.5%) among the pathogens involved. However, it should be noted that 13.3% of our cases were immunosuppressed. Mixed infections were relatively frequent (most commonly involving S. pneumoniae together with a respiratory virus). Moreover, we also documented a high percentage of viral CAP, which may be mainly attributable to the high number of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09-related pneumonia cases. In this regard, according to surveillance reports, influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 was the predominant virus causing illness in Europe and the Middle East during the 2010e2011 winter season. 22, 23 In Spain, there were 4747 detections of influenza viruses during the 2010e11 winter season. Of the total virus detections, 71.9% were influenza A viruses, mainly influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (97%), 27.8% influenza B and 0.3% influenza C. 24 Our study identified factors associated with severe disease in hospitalised patients with CAP during the first post-pandemic influenza season. These factors are markers of more severe pneumonia at hospital admission (impaired consciousness, septic shock, tachypnea, hyponatremia, and hypoxemia) and have been described as prognostic factors in previous CAP studies. 3 Interestingly, we also documented that influenza A (H1N1)pdm09-related pneumonia was independently associated with higher risk of severe disease. Compared with other aetiologies, influenza A (H1N1) pdm09-related pneumonia had a three times greater risk of ICU admission and in-hospital mortality. This explains the higher morbidity and mortality found in patients with viral pneumonia in the present study. Recently, it was documented in England, Greece, Spain and Taiwan 22, 23, 25, 26 that, in December 2010 and January 2011, there was a sharp rise in influenza-related hospitalisations, ICU admissions and fatalities than in the 2009-2010 season. Increasing age and certain comorbidities, as well as a delay in the administration of antiviral treatment, have been reported as causes of higher morbidity and mortality from influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 infection during this period. 26, 27 Moreover, as recently reported by Guti\u00e9rrez-Pizarraya et al., 28 we also documented an unexpected severity of cases of influenza B infection in patients that required hospitalisation during the first post-pandemic influenza season. Interestingly, we did not find comorbidities as independent risk factor for severe disease. However, it is extensively known that influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 affected mainly younger patients without comorbid conditions. 5, 29 In addition, we documented that the frequency of comorbid conditions was higher in patients with bacterial CAP.",

Similarly, patients with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09-related pneumonia presented more frequently with rhinorrhoea, sore throat, arthralgia and headache, but less commonly tachycardia and pleuritic chest pain. Laboratory findings showed that these patients also had high alanine aminotransferase more often, but leucocytosis less frequently.

Thus, a course of antiviral therapy guided solely by the application of the model would have left 2.5% (including those with bacterial co-infection) of the patients with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09-related pneumonia without specific coverage (score of 0 or 1), and would have led to CAP, community-acquired pneumonia; IQR, interquartile range; PSI, pneumonia severity index. a Patients were stratified into the following risk classes according to their PSI score: low risk ( 90 points, classes I, II and III) and high risk (>90 points, classes IV and V). b Patients were stratified into the following risk classes according to their CURB-65 score: low risk (0e1 point) and high risk (>1 point). administration of an unnecessary antiviral regimen to 58.2% of patients classified with scores of 4 or 5. In addition, the model was unable to distinguish between influenza A (H1N1)pdm09-related pneumonia and other aetiologies in most cases, because 41% of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09related pneumonia cases and 51.6% of cases with other aetiologies fell into the values of 3 and 4.

Thus, this cohort is representative of patients hospitalised with a pneumonic illness during the first post-pandemic period. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, no prior study has evaluated microbial patterns and outcomes in CAP during this period. Moreover, nearly 90% of patients underwent viral PCR and 95% underwent one or more bacterial identification tests. However, our study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, we did not compare our cohort of patients with those of other epidemiological periods to explore for differences in outcomes. Secondly, PCR testing was mainly performed on samples obtained via a nasopharyngeal swab. Evidence suggests that the yield of positive PCR results from nasopharyngeal swabs in patients with confirmed positive lower respiratory tract samples is nearly 80%. However, sampling was repeated when clinical suspicion was high in some cases in the present study. Thirdly, as serologic methods were not used to determine antibodies against atypical agents, these microorganisms are underrepresented. Lastly, hospital and ICU admission criteria were not standardized. However, to detect factors associated with severe disease, we performed a multivariate analysis to control for confounding factors. In addition, a post hoc analysis was performed considering ICU admission and intubation as dependent variable. Notably, the usefulness of biomarkers to predict prognosis was not evaluated in the present study.",
