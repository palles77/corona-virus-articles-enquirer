            "text": "The activation of somatic mutations conferring sensitivity to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been widely used in the development of advanced or metastatic primary lung cancer therapy. Therefore, identification of EGFR mutations is essential. In the present study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method was used to identify EGFR mutations, and its efficiency was compared with the Therascreen quantitative PCR assay. Using LAMP and Therascreen to analyze surgically resected tissue samples from patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutations were observed in 32/59 tumor samples (LAMP) and 33/59 tumor samples (Therascreen). Notably, the LAMP assay identified one tumor as wild-type, which had previously been identified as a deletion mutation in exon 19 via the Therascreen assay (Case X). However, the direct sequencing to confirm the EGFR status of the Case X adhered to the results of the LAMP assay. Further experiments using Case X DNA identified this exon 19 deletion mutation using both methods. In addition, a novel deletion mutation in exon 19 of the EGFR was identified. Overall, the present study shows that the LAMP method may serve as a valuable alternative for the identification oncogene mutations.",

Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer, accounting for 70-85% of cases and is primarily treated using systemic chemotherapy (3) . However, NSCLC treatment has evolved due to the development of therapy targeting the activation of mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (4) . EGFR activation is caused by genetic mutations, conferring susceptibility to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment, and was first reported in 2004 (5). EGFR mutations of pulmonary adenocarcinoma are present in 5-15% of the Caucasian population and 40-55% of the East Asian population (6) (7) (8) . Clinical trials have shown that patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma with an EGFR mutation exhibit clinical responses to orally administered EGFR inhibitors (5, 7, 9) . In 2016, Lin et al (4) reported that 20/137 (14.6%) patients with EGFR-mutant metastatic lung adenocarcinoma had a survival time of 5-years (4) . Therefore, detection of EGFR mutations is an important step in the treatment-decision pathway for patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma.",

Next-generation sequencing has improved the efficiency of oncogene testing by high-throughput sequencing, which can detect dozen of mutations at the same time, but the high-cost of this technique limits its clinical usage (13, 14) .

The tumor tissues were surgically resected from 189 consecutive patients diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma by the expert pathologist at The Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center (Kumagaya, Japan) between January 2016 and October 2017. All pathological diagnosis was determined on the basis of the WHO classification version 8 (19) by an expert pathologist, who normally makes a diagnosis using HE-stained slides using light microscope (Nikon Co., ECLIPSE Ni-u) from a low magnification to a high magnification. The inclusion criteria were as follows: i) Surgically resected tissue of primary lung cancer; ii) pulmonary adenocarcinoma; iii) enough volume materials for molecular testing; and iv) informed written consent from patients. Conversely, cases with no informed consent or less volume sample were excluded. Clinical characteristics of the 59 patients are presented in Table I . The mean patient age was 69.6 years and included 28 males and 31 females. All samples were fixed with 10% buffer formalin at room temperature (24-36 h) to create formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor blocks at Department of Pathology in Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed by the standard method using Tissue-Tek Prisma (Sakura Finetek Japan Co., Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Prior to DNA extraction, the tumor content of each sample was assessed using light microscopy at x10 and x100 magnification, to ensure efficient PCR amplification. After sections were deparaffinized with xylene and hydrated through a graded series of ethanol (100, 100, 85 and 70% ethanol), DNA from the tissue blocks was extracted using the QIAampTM DNA FFPE Tissue kit \u00ae (Qiagen, Inc.) and analyzed using a QIAcube Robot \u00ae (Qiagen, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocols (20) .",

Hence the identification of EGFR mutations has become a standard analysis in the treatment pathway of patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Although there are a number of methods available, there is no standardized approach to satisfy the practical clinical requirements of simplicity, rapid and cheap. Several PCR based methods have previously been used as a routine test for the detection of EGFR status in United States, European Union, Japan and China, including the Scorpion Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) \u00ae (22) , such as Therascreen PCR assay. This method was approved by the FDA as a standard approach for EGFR gene analysis in lung cancer (fda. gov/medical-devices/recently-approved-devices/therascreenr-fg fr-rgq-pcr-kit-p180043); however, although stable and reliable, this approach has procedural complexities, including complex settings and controls for the temperature at several times using a (24) and Cycleave PCR\u2122 (25) , have been developed in Japan and are commercially used in centralized laboratories. The sensitivity of the PNA-LNA PCR clamp is >97% with 100% specificity (26) and the accuracy of Cycleave PCR is 96.7% (27) , so it was the same for our results as it was those. LAMP is a new PCR method and is considered to be a robust approach for gene analysis as it does not require sophisticated or expensive equipment, such as a thermal cycler necessary for PCR (15) . Therefore, the LAMP method may have potential to decrease the costs of gene analysis. Previous studies have demonstrated the value of LAMP in field of bacteriology and virology (15, 17, 28, 29) ; however, few studies have reported the value of LAMP in oncology. Ikeda et al (30) used LAMP assays to detect EGFR mutations in NSCLC, demonstrating the value of LAMP, but only the L858R mutation was studied. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate other EGFR mutations, including those in exon 19, exon 21 and other minor mutations using LAMP assays.",

To evaluate the sensitivity of these two assays, a genetic analysis was performed to investigate the minimum concentration of EGFR mutation detection in both methods. The minimum concentration for LAMP was 4.8% and there were no detection under 1.0% in the Therascreen assay. Therefore, the minimum concentration for the LAMP assay is ~50 times higher than 4.8% in the Therascreen assay. With almost equal efficiency, detection of the exon 19 mutation in Case X using the Therascreen method suggested that LAMP, as well as direct sequence methods, could identify false negatives. However, additional experiments investigating Case X tumor tissues demonstrated the presence of deletion mutations in exon 19. The direct sequence method has reported low sensitivity (31, 32) , whereas the Therascreen method was generally recognized as a promising method (11, 12) . However, the identified mutation should be simplified, and an improved, faster and cheaper method of identification should be developed for its clinical application.",

The LAMP amplicons were denatured at 95\u02daC for 5 min, followed by hybridization at 37\u02daC for 5 min. Subsequently, the temperature was gradually raised to 80\u02daC and the fluorescent intensity was measured 7 times per 1\u02daC increment. The obtained data were analyzed by the LightCycler 480 \u00ae software (version 1.5.1.62; https://lifescience.roche.com/global_en/products/lightcycler14301-480-software-version-15.html) to calculate melting peak.Sensitivity of LAMP and Therascreen assays. In order to evaluate the analytical sensitivity, an artificial gene harboring an EGFR L858R mutation (c.2573T>G) as a plasmid DNA was obtained from Eurofin Genomics. The plasmid DNA that had been linearized using EcoR V and Xho I were extracted and purified from 1% agarose gel after 40 min electrophoresis with 100 V. The agarose gel was stained by 0.5 \u00b5g/ml ethidium bromide (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.; https://www. tcichemicals.com/eshop/en/jp/commodity/E0370/) for 30 min and observed by LuminoGraph 2 (ATTO Corporation; https://www.atto.co.jp/eng). Then, this DNA fragment was added to human pooled genomic DNA (Promega Corporation) to prepare several spiked-in samples with different concentrations for a validation of lower limit of detection. Genetic analysis of each of these samples was conducted three times using PCR and LAMP.Direct sequence method. Direct sequencing of EGFR exon 19, S7681 and G719X regions were conducted by using BigDye \u00ae Direct Cycle Sequencing Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and a ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer \u00ae (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) to confirm the EGFR mutation status in Case-X.
