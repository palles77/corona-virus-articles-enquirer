            "text": "An intracellular defective-interfering (DI) RNA, DlssE, of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) obtained after serial high multiplicity passage of the virus was cloned and sequenced. DlssE RNA is composed of three noncontiguous genomic regions, representing the first 864 nucleotides of the 5' end, an internal 748 nucleotides of the polymerase gene, and 601 nucleotides from the S'end of the parental MHV genome. The DlssE sequence contains one large continuous open reading frame. Two protein products from this open reading frame were identified both by in vitro translation and in DIinfected cells. Sequence comparison of DlssE and the corresponding parts of the parental virus genome revealed that DlssE had three base substitutions within the leader sequence and also a deletion of nine nucleotides located at the junction of the leader and the remaining genomic sequence. The 5' end of DlssE RNA was heterogeneous with respect to the number of UCUAA repeats within the leader sequence. The parental MHV genomic RNA appears to have extensive and stable secondary structures at the regions where DI RNA rearrangements occurred. These data suggest that MHV DI RNA may have been generated as a result of the discontinuous and nonprocessive manner of MHV RNA synthesis.",

The negative-stranded RNA then serves as the template for the synthesis of six subgenomic and a genomic-sized mRNA Lai et a/., 198213) . These mRNAs are arranged in the form of a 3' coterminal \"nested\" set, i.e., the sequence of each mRNA is contained entirely within the next larger mRNA (Lai et a/., 198 1; Leibowitz et al., 1981) . In addition, each mRNA has a common leader sequence, which is derived from the 5' end of the genome (Lai et a/., 1982a (Lai et a/., , 1983 Spaan et al., 1983) . Several pieces of evidence demonstrated that MHV utilizes a novel mechanism of leader RNA-primed transcription, in which a free leader RNA species derived from the 5' end of genomic RNA is utilized as a primer for the transcription of subgenomic mRNAs (Baric eta/., 1983 (Baric eta/., , 1985 Makino et a/., 1986b) .",

In DIinfected cells, the synthesis of most of the standard viral mRNAs is inhibited. Instead, three distinct virusspecific RNA species could be detected (Makino eta/., 1985) (Fig. 1 ). The first species, DlssA, is equivalent to Dl virion RNA in length and is eventually incorporated into virus particles. This RNA differs from the standard virus genome in that it contains multiple deletions distributed throughout the genome, except for the 5' and 3' ends of the genomic RNA (Makino et a/., 1985) which encode RNA polymerase (gene A) and nucleocapsid (N) protein, respectively. Surprisingly, DlssA RNA can replicate by itself in the absence of helper virus infection, suggesting that DlssA codes for functional RNA polymerases (Makino et a/., 1988) . Thus, DlssA is not a defective RNA in a strict sense. The second major RNA species found in DI-infected cells is indistinguishable from the mRNA 7 made by the standard virus. The synthesis of this mRNA and its product N protein is not inhibited in DI-infected cells. The third RNA species is a novel single-stranded polyadenylated DI RNA species of varying size. Oligonucleotide fingerprinting studies suggest that it represents se-quences derived from various noncontiguous parts of the genome. The size of this RNA varies with the DI passage level (Makino et a/., 1985) . One of these RNAs, DlssE, which is the smallest DI RNA detected, has been analyzed in greater detail (Makino et al., 1988) . In contrast to DlssA, DlssE RNA synthesis requires helper virus coinfection (Makino et al,, 1988) . Only a trace amount of it is incorporated into virus partcles to serve as a template for RNA replication (Makino et a/., 1988) . Thus, it may lack packaging signals. On the other hand, since it is efficiently replicated in DIinfected cells, DlssE RNA must contain the sequences essential for viral RNA replication.",

To understand the complete 5' end sequence of DlssE, we performed primer-extension studies on DlssE RNA using a specific primer (5'~AATGTCAGCACTATGACA-3') complementary to nucleotides 123-140 from the 5' end of the genome of MHV-JHM . The Ei'end-labeled primer was hybridized to gel-purified DlssE RNA and extended with reverse transcriptase. Primer extension products were then analyzed by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 M urea. As shown in Fig. 4A , two cDNA products of 136 and 131 nucleotides were obtained, indicating heterogeneity at the 5'end sequence of DlssE. These primerextended products were sequenced by the Maxam-Gilbert method. The sequences of both cDNA products were identical except that the faster migrating cDNA products contained three UCUAA repeats at the 3'end of the leader sequence, while the slower migrating species contained four UCUAA repeats (Fig. 4B ). In addition, the 5'end sequences of DlssE and MHV-JHM genomic RNA showed several differences. Within the leader sequence, 3 bases were substituted in DlssE RNA (Fig. 4B , asterisks) and nine nucleotides (UUUAU-AAAC) were deleted in DlssE at the junction between the leader RNA and the remaining genomic sequences. The significance of the heterogeneity in the number of UCUAA repeats and of the nine-nucleotide deletion will be discussed below.",

The discrepancy between the predicted and observed molecular weights of the translation products of DlssE could be due to post-translational modification of the protein or aberrant migration of the protein. A small amount of p28 was immunoprecipitated with anti-p28 antibody in MHV-JHM-infected cells (Fig. 5B, lane 5) . However, this protein was hardly detectable in DI-infected cells (Fig. 58, lane 6) .

Since all MHV-specific subgenomic mRNAs contain the leader sequence, yet only genomic-sized RNA is efficiently packaged into virus par-ticles, the packaging signal is probably located in gene A but not in leader sequence. The present study indicates that DlssE RNA has a nine-nucleotide (UUUAU-AAAC) deletion at the junction between the leader RNA and the remaining genomic RNA sequence. However, this deletion is not likely to account for the failure of efficient DI RNA packaging into virus particles since DlssA and the genomic RNA of a mutant MHV-JHM, both of which are packaged into virus particles, also have similar nine-nucleotide deletions (S.

Furthermore, the sizes of these RNA products correspond to the lengths between the 5' end and the sites of hairpin loops (Baric et al,, 1987) , in agreement with the notion that transcription pauses at these hairpin loops. Thus, the potential hairpin loops present in the genomic RNA at the DI RNA rearrangement sites could have interrupted RNA transcription. The incomplete RNA tran-script may join the RNA template at the downstream rearrangement sites and create deleted RNA as a result. However, there is no consensus sequence at the sites of RNA deletion and reinitiation. It is not known how the reinitiation of RNA synthesis occurred.",

It is interesting to note that the UCUAAAC, which is the consensus sequence for the leader RNA binding is imperfectly repeated (UAUAAAC) at nine nucleotides downstream . It is these nine nucleotides which were deleted in DlssE RNA. Similar nine-nucleotide deletions have also been noted in the genomic RNA of DlssA, and that of an MHV-JHM mutant virus (S. Makino, unpublished data) . This RNA structure suggests that RNA synthesis may pause at the first repeat, and then reinitiate at the second repeat because of the binding of the incomplete RNA transcript to the second repeat. Finally, the heterogeneity in the number of UCUAA repeats in DI RNAs also supports the discontinuous nature of coronavirus RNA replication. Similar heterogeneity has been noted in the genomic RNA of several different MHV strains (S. Makino and M. M. C. Lai, manuscript in preparation) . Thus, DI RNA may be a product of discontinuous, nonprocessive RNA replication of coronaviruses.",

This difference could be due to unusual configurations affecting electrophoretic migration, or due to the presence of phosphorylation, since the N protein is phosphorylated (Stohlman and Lai, 1979) and protein translated in vitro could be phosphorylated (Chattopadhyay and Banerjee, 1987) . A similar difference between the predicted and actual molecular mass of the N protein has previously been noted . The relationship between the two protein species is not clear. The N protein has also been shown to consist of multiple species (Robbins et al., 1986) . It is not clear whether these proteins play any functional roles in DI-infected cells. Typically, DI RNAs do not synthesize any protein; however, in the Sindbis virus system, translation products have been detected from a DI RNA (Migliaccio et al., 1985) .",

We have previously demonstrated that the presence of stable secondary structure at the 5' end noncoding regions of the polymerase gene reduced the amount of polymerse protein synthesized in vitro . Also, as discussed previously, the presence of the small ORF encoding eight amino acids (Fig.  3 ) may reduce the number of ribosomes reaching the downstream optimal translation site . Since DlssE RNA has a 5' end structure similar to that of genomic RNA, the DlssE RNA may provide a tool to better our understanding of the mechanism of translational control of MHV RNAs. Furthermore, the fusion protein synthesized by DlssE RNA may be useful for understanding the functional and structural domains of the MHV polymerase and N protein.",
