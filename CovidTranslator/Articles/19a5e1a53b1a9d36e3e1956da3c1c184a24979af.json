PBMC of DF convalescent patients were stimulated in vitro with dengue virus-derived peptides, which were prepared based on the prediction of dengue virus-specific CD4 + T-cell epitopes by using RANKpep online software. Subsequently, the frequency of IFN-\u2425 producing T cells and percentage of IFN-\u2425 + CD4 + T cells were measured by using ELISPOT assay and ICS assay (intracellular cytokine straining), respectively. The positive response of PBMC by ELISPOT showed that the numbers of SFC (spots forming cells) ranged from 50 to 310 SFC/1 \u00d7 10 6 PBMC. The positive response of PBMC by ICS assay showed that the percentage of IFN-\u2425 + CD4 + T cells ranged from 0.03 to 0.27%. As a result, C 45-57 (KLVMAFIAFLRFL), E 396-408 (SSIGKMFEATARG), NS3 23-35 (YRILQRGLLGRSQ), and NS3 141-155 (NREGKIVGLYGNGVV) were identified as dengue virus-specific CD4 + T-cell epitopes.",

Currently, many studies suggested that dengue-specific T-cell immune response are hypothesized to play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of DHF during a secondary DEN virus infection, and induction of immunopathology by T lymphocytes may occur by various mechanisms, including cell-mediated cytotoxicity and/or cytokine production (Miskovsky et al., 1994; Vergelli et al., 1997) . In addition, other study showed that DHF is associated with high levels of T-cell cytokines such as IFN-\u2425 and TNF-\u2423, and evidence of marked T-cell activation (Libraty et al., 2002) . Recently, immunopathogenesis in DHF has been proposed. The evidence is that both dengue-specific CD8 + and CD4 + lymphocytes have been implicated in pathogenesis and natural immunity to dengue viruses Lei et al., 2001) . How T cells contribute to this process is incompletely defined, however, since only a few studies have directly examined T-cell responses during acute disease and few DEN-specific T-cell epitopes have been identified (Green et al., 1999; Mongkolsapaya et al., 2003) . Therefore, the establishment of a library of defined T-cell epitopes from dengue viruses will help to explore the role of T cells in immunity and disease pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Initially, the viral T-cell epitopes were identified either by sequencing of eluted peptides bound to MHC molecules (Major Histocompability Complex) or by screening panels of overlapping peptides derived from the viral protein. However, these two methods have their shortcomings. The former is cumbersome and needs sophisticated equipments (such as mass spectrometer or peptide sequencer). The latter needs synthesis of a series of the overlapping peptides and massive experiments to identify which peptide is epitope, making it an extensive and time-consuming process (Drabner et al., 2002) . At present, a novel strategies that utilize computer-based T-cell epitopes prediction methods combined with in vitro/in vivo studies was established to predict potential T-cell epitopes and are becoming increasingly popular as the amino acid sequences of pathogenic proteins are available in database (Huang et al., 2004; Turcanov\u00e1 and H\u00f6llsberg, 2004) . Epitope-prediction program RANKpep was developed by the \"molecular immunology foundation\" by P.A. Reche et al., which uses position specific scoring matrics (PSSM), cleavage model and predicts MHC binding peptide from an input protein based on their similarity to a set of peptides known to bind to a given MHC molecule (Reche et al., 2004) . Among epitopes-prediction programs, RANKpep prediction algorithm has higher sensitivity and specificity and represents a quick and effective way to identify T-cell epitopes (Drabner et al., 2002; Gomez-Nunez et al., 2006; Reche et al., 2002 Reche et al., , 2004 . Recently, ELISPOT assay and ICS assay were extensively used to measure the frequencies of memory T cells. Compared with other in vitro methods, ELISPOT assay and ICS assay own the higher sensitivity and the latter have the advantage of defining the phenotype of the cytokine secreting cells (Waldrop et al., 1997; Butz and Bevan, 1998; Pala et al., 2000) . Therefore, the combination of ELISPOT assay and ICS assay is necessary to identify T-cell epitopes.",

            "text": "Up to date, studies identified some DEN-specific CD4 + T-cell epitopes, which are mainly located in NS3 protein or C protein Fig. 2 . Frequencies of IFN-\u2425 + CD4 + T cells in PBMC of subjects. Numbers on the upper right hand corner of each panel indicate IFN-\u2425 + CD4 + T cells as percentage of CD4 + T cell. Data acquisition was performed on a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD bioscience) using CellQuest software. The number of events collected for each sample varied between 100,000 and 300,000, depending on the donors. CD4 + /CD8 + cells were gated and analyzed for cytokine expression. (Kurane et al., 1995 (Kurane et al., , 1998 Gagnon et al., 1996; Mangada et al., 2004) . However, most of these epitopes are only conserved in DEN-4 or DEN-3 or DEN-2, 3, 4 and the epitope which is highly conserved in DEN-1 had not been identified. Furthermore, the low sensitive methods/technologies (the limiting dilution method and cytotoxic assay) limited general laboratories to identify T-cell epitopes. In this study, we measured a higher frequencies of DEN peptide-specific IFN-\u2425 responding CD4 + T cells by using ELISPOT assay and ICS assay and then identified four DEN-specific CD4 + T-cell epitopes. More importantly, among the 10 DF convalescent patients, as for each peptide, the breadth of the positive response ranged from 7 to 8 subjects. This suggested that these epitopes could be the immunodominant epitopes and restricted by the high-frequency HLA alleles of human population. Of course, future experiments would be performed to determine the HLA restriction of these epitopes. Among these four epitopes, C 45-57 and NS3 141-155 contains the sequence that was previously characterized as DEN-specific CD4 + Tcell epitopes (C 47-55 and NS3 146-154 , respectively) (Kurane et al., 1995; Gagnon et al., 1996) . Therefore, our results indicated that C 47-55 and NS3 146-154 could be the minimal sequence recognized by MHC-II molecule. Interestingly, NS3 146-154 was previously identified as HLA-DR15-restricted epitope (Kurane et al., 1995) while the putative HLA allele of NS3 141-155 by RANKpep is HLA-DR15. In addition, C 47-55 was HLA-DPw4restricted epitope (Gagnon et al., 1996) while the restricting HLA alleles of C 45-57 by RANKpep include DPw4. Therefore, these information suggested that the restricting HLA alleles of C 45-57 and NS3 141-155 could be closely related with DPw4 and DR15, respectively. In this study, E 396-408 and NS3 23-35 are two novel identified CD4 + T-cell epitopes. Since E protein is the important structural protein in DEN infection and immunity, more researchers aimed to identified T-cell epitopes located in this protein and defined some T-cell epitopes Simmons et al., 2005; Bashyam et al., 2006) . However, to our knowledge, E 396-408 is the first CD4 + T-cell epitopes identified in human population. Importantly, E 396-408 is only highly conserved in DEN-1 strains. Therefore, the identification of E 396-408 would help to explore the role of T-cell immune response induced by E protein in DEN infection or immunity. Previous study shown that NS3 protein appears to be the most immunogenic antigen for cellular responses to DEN and there exist many T-cell epitopes in NS3 200-324 (Mathew et al., 1996) . Consequently, most research focused on identifying T-cell epitopes located in this region (Kurane et al., 1995 (Kurane et al., , 1998 . In this study, the identification of NS3 23-35 suggested that the other region of NS3 could also contribute to T-cell immune response.",
