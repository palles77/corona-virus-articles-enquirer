We investigated the effect of increasing temperature on Conalbumin (CA) and induced aggregation at 65 \u2022 C. The enhanced Thioflavin T (ThT) and ANS (1-anilinonaphtalene 8-sulfonic acid) fluorescence intensity, show no shift on Congo red binding, additionally, transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM) (SEM) reveal amorphous morphology of the aggregate. Our investigation clearly demonstrated that polyols namely Glycerol (GL) and Ethylene glycol (EG) are so staunch to inhibit amorphous aggregates via restoring secondary conformation. Addition of polyols (15% GL and 35% EG) significantly decrease the turbidity, Rayleigh scattering ThT and ANS fluorescence intensity. The dynamic light scattering (DLS) data show that hydrodynamic radii (R h ) of the aggregates is \u223c20 times higher than native CA while nearly similar for GL and EG protected CA due to condensation of core size with little difference.",

Such conformational aberrations are highly linked with many pathological disorders [1, 2] . The hydrophobic and hydrophilic forces established between solvent and protein molecules possess a principle impact on the conformation stabilization of proteins.",

The establishment of novel interactions in the protein molecule occurs due to enhanced exposure of thiol groups or hydrophobic patches to thermally induced aggregation [4] . The cataract disease for instance is a result of aggregation of a \u2425D-crystalline protein which has been categorized as amorphous in nature [5] , similarly Fanconi syndrome [6] , light-chain deposition disease (LCDD), and myeloma nephropathy [7] . While, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, spongiform encephalopathies, and type II diabetes mellitus [1, 2, 8] are amyloid aggregates. In the production of bacterial recombinant proteins, the formed inclusion bodies are also classified as amorphous aggregates. It is an outcome of the accumulation of excessively produced polypeptides followed by the unavailability of sufficient chaperons to govern the folding process to rescue from aggregation and restoration of nascent peptides [9, 10] . In a similar vein in liquor industry, the amorphous aggregate formation takes place in the form of protein haze during the course of white wine production [11] . Thermally induced aggregation is one of the most studied factors where several proteins have been reported to have undergone the process of aggregate formation at elevated temperature but the effective temperature and duration of incubation fluctuates from protein to protein. (apoPhb) of rabbit origin [12] , while Aquaporin 0 (AQP0) aggregates at 60 \u2022 C [13] , bovine hemoglobin aggregates at \u223c70 \u2022 C [14] , recombinant human interferon alpha2b (rhIFN\u24232b) aggregates at 50 \u2022 C [15] while SARS-associated corona virus (SARS-CoV) protein aggregates at most extreme condition i.e. boiling temperature [16] . Thermal and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide [14] , NaCl [17] , acidic pH [18] , metal [19] , atheronal-A, atheronal-B, cholesterol [20] , Rosin modified surfactant, (QMRAE) [21] , non-fluorinated and fluorinated cosolvents [22] are few examples of physical as well as chemical inducer where protein unambiguously forms amorphous aggregate. While, cationic surfactant like CTAB induce amyloid fibrils in stem bromelain [23] .",

In such trend, that dual function has been displayed by quercetin for the conformation conservation of insulin, which inhibits the fibril formation and also shows disorganizing ability by amyloid fibril (ordered structure) conversion into amorphous aggregates (unordered structure) [25] . In this series, clofazimine inhibits as well as destabilize the fibrils of hen egg white lysozyme [26] . Moreover, Aspartate-\u2424-semi aldehyde dehydrogenase forms aggregates, via soluble to insoluble polymerization as function of concentration and time. Lumry-Eyring with nucleated polymerization (LENP) model revealed that increasing concentrations of glycerol inhibits the formation of insoluble, high molecular weight aggregates by delaying the polymerization [27] . The weak polarity-reducing property of ethylene glycol curtails the interaction between hydrocarbon spacer arm mediated nonspecific interaction of N 6 -(6-Aminohexyl)-AMP and functional hydrophobic sites present on the pig heart lactate dehydrogenase. The low concentration of ethylene glycol achieves high retrieval of enzymatic activity along with increased yield of enzyme during chromatographic elution within the concentration range of 20-30% (v/v) [28] . Fat as additive used for prion, fetches the more trifling condition for its inactivation, while, glycerol provides stability to the prion 27-30 or prion rods during heat treatment by shielding the peptide backbone [29] . An earlier study on reversing the impact on mutant archetype of Familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) H187R, has confirmed that glycerol effectively diminishes the PrP187R accumulation in lysosomes of transfected cells followed by transportation up to the cell surface [30] .",

During the temperature increase, the loss in MRE 215nm continuously increased (Fig. 3A inset) . The augmentation of CD signals and transformation of single trough into two negative minima at 208 and 222 nm was investigated by the addition of initial GL concentration, 3% (v/v). The effect of GL continues in accordance with the gradual increase and nearly native-like secondary structure (Fig. 3B) was restored by final addition used, 15% (v/v). A similar stabilizing behavior of polyols has been established by gradual increase in the EG concentration added to CA.

The native protein has a minimum exposure of hydrophobic cluster to the solvent and produce very low intensity upon its excitation at 380 nm. Following its exposure to more heat, CA unfolds and the level of exposure increases up to the 65 \u2022 C, at which protein undergoes unfolding followed by polymerization and within 1 h CA gets aggregated and fluorescence intensity is enhanced by \u223c13 fold than native (Table 1) . At the temperature range 75-85 \u2022 C, the ANS shows a decrease in the fluorescence intensity but the intensity remains significant (Fig. 4D ). The addition of polyols decreases the ANS fluorescence intensity as a function of increasing concentration by mediating the protein stabilization and regulating the exposure of hydrophobic patches (Fig. 4E-F) . At the highest added concentrations of GL 15% (v/v) and EG 35% (v/v), the slightly significant signals of ANS fluorescence suggest the presence of some little hydrophobic pockets on the surface of the induced secondary structure which provide site for ANS interaction (supplementary Fig. S2 ), (Table 1) . It was also observed that the ANS itself strongly interacts with both of the polyols and its fluorescence intensity is enhanced as the concentration of GL and EG are increased (data not shown), so the resulting effect of the polyols addition on the exposed hydrophobic patches was obtained by subtracting the blank.",

The R h of CA at neutral pH was observed to be 5.1 nm (Fig. 5A) , which is compatible with reported value [39] , but it drastically increased to be 103 nm at 65 \u2022 C (Fig. 5B) , confirming that the CA has undergone aggregation followed by polymerization. The heat treatment prior to the GL 15% (v/v) and EG 35% (v/v) pre-incubation, managed to keep the CA in its monomeric form and the R h was found to be 5.4 and 5.6, respectively (Fig. 5C-D) , which is slightly greater than its native value.

The same pattern was also observed at neutral pH (close to isoelectric point) as denaturation occurs in the pI range of CA 6.0-6.8 [53] . The reduction in turbidity and Rayleigh scattering is due to the interaction of polyols with CA which nearly quash the impact of heat treatment. The change in max was investigated to evaluate the refolding or unfolding of CA when processed during the experimental condition. We observed the neutrality of temperature range 25-45 \u2022 C on the max , while above this, a dramatic change with red shift of 9 nm was observed. The movement of Trp residues toward more hydrophobic region was accompanied by blue shift of 5 nm, when CA was incubated with increasing concentration of GL and EG.",

Similarly, the pre-incubated CA with GL and EG, decrease the Congo red spectra (supplementary Fig. S3 ). The DLS data divulge the difference of hydrodynamic radii (R h ) of aggregated CA which is nearly 20 times (103 nm) than native (5.1). GL 15% (v/v) and EG 35% (v/v) preserves CA at monomeric form even at 65 \u2022 C and prevent oligomerization (Fig. 5) but interaction of CA with polyols slightly increase the hydrodynamic radii (R h ) as well as apparent molecular weight ( Table 1 ). The collective consideration of all data obtained, GL is found to be more effective than EG. The effect pro-duced by EG for the conformational restoration of CA is achieved by the addition of nearly half of the concentration of GL. The ability of ethylene glycol for weakening the hydrophobic interaction amid sorbent and protein, serves itself as admirable mobile phase for the protein purification method involving hydrophobic interaction chromatography [59] . In which, ethylene glycol serves itself as excellent mobile phase by declining the hydrophobic interaction between sorbent and protein molecule.",

In this mechanism monomer, primarily with low proclivity of reversible association, undergoes conformation transformation via unfolding which enables the strong association under physical strain. The thermal stress cause the destabilization of CA and the unfolded state followed by display of hydrophobic patches which allow the hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction for finally aggregation. For the protection of CA conformation and anti-aggregation activity, the protection of CA monomer is a prerequisite. The pre-incubation of CA with GL 15% (v/v) and EG 35% (v/v), allows their interaction with CA monomers and hamper the thermal stress to produce unfolded population, hence, unavailability of such unfolded precursor cannot lead the aggregation (Fig. 7) .",

The osmolytes mediated stabilization of protein depend on the osmolytes-water interaction as double resolution model suggest that TMAO interact with two or three water molecule which prohibit the closeness of TAMO with protein via exclusion from the locality of protein [61] . The exact mechanism of structural modulation triggered by addition of cosolutes remains ambiguous, although adequate works are available, proposing various models like, enhanced surface tension, Wyman binding function, preferential hydration, and excluded volume [62, 63] . Increases in polyols concentration modulate the hydrophobic patches by pushing them towards the interior of proteins which causes compactness in proteins. Further, this compactness of protein hinder the hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction (the main culprit of aggregation of protein) and thus inhibition of protein occurs as reported in previous literatures [64, 65] .",

The little expansion in the radius but condense the core size of conalbumin occurs upon the interaction with GL and EG. For the overall conformational restoration, GL was found to be more effective than EG as it requires 15% (v/v) as compared to EG 35% (v/v). It would be very significant in future studies to investigate how polyols are further affecting the activity of pre-incubated proteins on thermal or other destabilizing stress. In case of successful restoration of enzymatic activity of proteins upon the addition of low concentrations of polyols will provide excellent lead against the harsh conditions encountered by protein in industries as well as transportation. The inhibition is due to hindrance of hydrophobic interaction (responsible for aggregation) that is caused by compactness of proteins as a result of shifting of hydrophobic patches in the inner side of proteins.
