            "text": "It is generally agreed that most patients with refractory VT or VF often have underlying structural heart disease, 1 often associated with acute ischemia, reperfusion after transient ischemia, worsening heart failure, medications, underlying primary arrhythmia syndromes, hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, and hyperthyroidism, among other factors. 3 A common pathway in patients with risk factors is the enhanced sympathetic catecholaminergic overdrive, which can augment and perpetuate the arrhythmia itself. 1 The management of electrical storm requires a basic knowledge of the arrhythmia mechanism and possible reversible etiologies, along with the implementation of aggressive abortive interventions. 1 Polymorphic VT, such as in this case, may result from acute ischemia or reperfusion, prolonged QT (both congenital and acquired), Brugada syndrome, CPVT, acute myocarditis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and medications, among other causes. When seen in patients with a normal heart, VF is generally triggered by closely coupled monomorphic PVCs, bradycardia, and hypokalemia. 1 It is well accepted that myocardial ischemia is one of the most prevalent etiologies of polymorphic VT and VF. In this particular case, after a thorough evaluation of the causative factors, it appears that a combination of profound electrolyte disarrangements, ventricular ectopy, and mild myocarditis were responsible for the patient's clinical arrhythmias. Ischemia, in turn, though part of the differential, was less likely the culprit, as evidenced by the negative successive cardiac biomarkers, as well as preserved EF and absence of wall motion abnormalities seen on initial evaluation with echocardiography.",

Especially in this case, against the backdrop of Fanconi syndrome and stage IV chronic kidney disease, the patient's profound hypokalemia was thought to be a major determinant of the recurrent arrhythmias. Despite the aggressive repletion of potassium in the setting of acute or chronic renal insufficiency, serial blood draws showed a downward trend in serum K 1 levels, which made the arrhythmia resistant to treatment. Animal studies have demonstrated that hypokalemia-induced arrhythmogenicity stems from prolonged ventricular repolarization, slowed conduction, and abnormal pacemaker activity. 4 Intravenous beta blocker administration is also indicated in a variety of situations of incessant VT, including acute myocardial ischemia and long QT syndrome (LQTS), and has been used with favorable results and mortality improvement. 1 In this case, initial intravenous propranolol use in the emergency department was precluded by periodic bradycardia episodes that consistently deteriorated into VT and VF. However, after placement of a temporary pacemaker, concomitant use of beta blockers is feasible, as was seen in our patient. Amiodarone may also be effective in suppressing and controlling malignant VT storm episodes. 5 Ultimately, ECMO placement along with sedation and intubation, stellate ganglionic blockade, antiarrhythmic drug therapy, rapid ventricular pacing, and aggressive electrolyte replacement succeeded in decreasing the arrhythmia burden and attaining hemodynamic stability.",

The prolonged QT interval seemed to be a consequence of severe hypokalemia secondary to Fanconi syndrome; however, a congenital LQTS could not be fully excluded. It was deemed less likely, however, since congenital QT syndromes present infrequently as VT storm. This distinction is important since therapy of acquired LQTS differs from that of inherited LQTS. Specifically, using catecholamines, including isoproterenol, should be avoided in most inherited syndromes because of its proarrhythmic effect. 1 Intravenous magnesium, overdrive pacing, and isoproterenol are recommended for acquired LQTS.",

            "text": "Endomyocardial biopsy and histopathologic studies revealed a mild myocarditic process as evidenced by interstitial lymphocytic inflammation and edema. Cardiotropic viral exposure and genetic predisposition may play a role, but still less than 10% of infected subjects develop a histologically confirmed myocarditis. 1 In our case, the patient tested positive for a possible recent infection with coxsackievirus B6 (1:32 titers). Arrhythmia development in these patients may stem from autoimmune response-induced cellular injury. 1 Different hypotheses have been put forward to explain the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia in these cases, including, but not limited to, myocardial fibrosis and secondary hypertrophy that may favor regional slowing of action potentials resulting in reentry circuits. 6 Additionally, there are some limited data that suggest that specific myocardial channelopathies may be linked to ventricular arrhythmias in the setting of myocarditis. 7 Our case also illustrates how histology remains the gold standard for diagnosis of myocarditis, and how its role should not be undermined. The initial ECG did not reveal any of the hallmarks of myocardial necrosis in our patient. Cardiac biomarkers, as previously stated, remained negative, but these have a sensitivity ranging from 34% to 53%. 8 Echocardiography is also key in suspected myocarditis, as impaired myocardial contractility may become evident. The precipitous drop in EF in this patient is believed to have resulted from myocardial stunning and rapid overdrive pacing rather than a fulminant myocardial process. Yet, it is fair to mention that left ventricular contractility, along with the patient's overall clinical condition, improved after intravenous immunoglobulin infusion.",

The TRDN protein plays a role in muscle excitation-contraction coupling as part of the calcium release complex in association with the ryanodine receptor. 9 Homozygous TRDN mutations have been reported in associated with autosomal recessive forms of long QT and CPVT, whereas from a renal perspective, TRDN mutations have been linked with IgA nephritis and renal failure. 10 In CPVT, point mutations are responsible for the instability and future degradation of the protein. 11 Since our patient was heterozygous for a previously unreported variant in TRDN, a primary genetic basis for her arrhythmias is extremely unlikely. However, we cannot exclude that the heterozygous carrier state may interact with specific conditioning circumstances and make an individual more susceptible to lethal arrhythmias in the appropriate setting. Though evidence is limited to case reports and small series, it appears that some cases of therapeutically challenging electrical storm have been successfully managed with endocardial and epicardial radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA), even with myocarditis as the working diagnosis. 12 In chronic Chagas myocarditis, RFCA can be effective in decreasing VT recurrence, although the targeted VT is typically monomorphic. In non-Chagasic myocarditis patients, RCFA may be an effective intervention in VT storm; nonetheless, the long-term efficacy in this clinical setting remains unclear. 13 For this particular patient, it appears that RCFA may not have been the most appropriate intervention, given the polymorphic nature of the ventricular arrhythmias, the lack of an obvious triggering PVC (multiple morphologies seen on ECG), and the relatively acute resolution of arrhythmias. 14 ",
