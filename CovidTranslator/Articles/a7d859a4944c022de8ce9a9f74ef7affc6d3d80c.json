            "text": "Methods This study was a phase 1, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation study of GLS-5300 done at the Walter Reed Army Institute for Research Clinical Trials Center (Silver Spring, MD, USA). We enrolled healthy adults aged 18-50 years; exclusion criteria included previous infection or treatment of MERS. Eligible participants were enrolled sequentially using a dose-escalation protocol to receive 0\u00b767 mg, 2 mg, or 6 mg GLS-5300 administered by trained clinical site staff via a single intramuscular 1 mL injection at each vaccination at baseline, week 4, and week 12 followed immediately by co-localised intramuscular electroporation. Enrolment into the higher dose groups occurred after a safety monitoring committee reviewed the data following vaccination of the first five participants at the previous lower dose in each group. The primary outcome of the study was safety, assessed in all participants who received at least one study treatment and for whom post-dose study data were available, during the vaccination period with follow-up through to 48 weeks after dose 3. Safety was measured by the incidence of adverse events; administration site reactions and pain; and changes in safety laboratory parameters. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT 02670187) and is completed. Findings Between Feb 17 and July 22, 2016, we enrolled 75 individuals and allocated 25 each to 0\u00b767 mg, 2 mg, or 6 mg GLS-5300. No vaccine-associated serious adverse events were reported. The most common adverse events were injection-site reactions, reported in 70 participants (93%) of 75. Overall, 73 participants (97%) of 75 reported at least one solicited adverse event; the most common systemic symptoms were headache (five [20%] with 0\u00b767 mg, 11 [44%] with 2",

The most common unsolicited adverse events were infections, occurring in 27 participants (36%); six (8%) were deemed possibly related to study treatment. There were no laboratory abnormalities of grade 3 or higher that were related to study treatment; laboratory abnormalities were uncommon, except for 15 increases in creatine phosphokinase in 14 participants (three participants in the 0\u00b767 mg group, three in the 2 mg group, and seven in the 6 mg group). Of these 15 increases, five (33%) were deemed possibly related to study treatment (one in the 2 mg group and four in the 6 mg group). Seroconversion measured by S1-ELISA occurred in 59 (86%) of 69 participants and 61 (94%) of 65 participants after two and three vaccinations, respectively. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 34 (50%) of 68 participants. T-cell responses were detected in 47 (71%) of 66 participants after two vaccinations and in 44 (76%) of 58 participants after three vaccinations. There were no differences in immune responses between dose groups after 6 weeks. At week 60, vaccine-induced humoral and cellular responses were detected in 51 (77%) of 66 participants and 42 (64%) of 66, respectively.",

Animal challenge studies have shown protection for several vaccines; [8] [9] [10] [11] however, clearly discriminating between binding antibodies, neutralising antibodies, and T-cell responses as the determinant of protection is not possible. Both humoral and cellular immunity probably play a substantial role in viral clearance and mitigation of human clinical disease. MERS coronavirus infection induces neutralising antibodies that persist for several years. [12] [13] [14] Passive transfer of either monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal serum samples has the ability to lower viral loads and reduce pathology in the lungs of several animal models. [14] [15] [16] However, the concentrations of MERS coronavirus neutralising antibodies do not always correlate with viral clearance, survival, or disease severity. 12, 14, 17, 18 A study in Saudi Arabia showed that CD8 T-cell responses directly correlated with shorter stays in hospital intensive care units and lower viral load in the respiratory tract. 14 Given the uncertainty in defining a correlate of protection, a vaccine candidate that generates both humoral and cellular immune responses is desirable.",

Compared with vaccine-induced humoral and cellular responses, antibody titres following natural infection were significantly higher in the acute phase in MERS-infected participants but were not different than vaccine for S1-ELISA or neutralising antibodies in convalescent samples (appendix p 6).

The most common intramuscular injection and electroporation. 21 The vaccine was immunogenic, inducing seroconversion and T-cell responses in most participants. S1-ELISA binding antibody seroconversion and T-cell responses were rapid. Vaccine induced immune responses were durable, as most participants maintained detectable S1 binding antibodies and had cellular immune responses at almost 1 year after the last vaccination. The vaccineinduced antibody and cellular immune responses were similar to those in the convalescent phase from samples in patients who recovered from natural MERS coronavirus infection. Finally, GLS-5300 vaccination induced polyfunctional CD8+ T-cell responses that have been shown to correlate with less severe disease and lower MERS coronavirus shedding. 14 Immune responses to GLS-5300 were dose-independent across a nearly 10-fold dose range (0\u00b767 mg to 6 mg per vaccination) suggesting further dose reductions might be possible. A lower dose could extend the vaccine supply in an outbreak situation. GLS-5300 is the first MERS coronavirus vaccine to advance into human trials. Among vaccine candidates in development, 22 four have started or will soon start phase 1 testing, including measles-vectored, 9,23 chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored, 24 and modified vaccinia Ankaravectored vaccines, all expressing full-length S-glycoprotein. [25] [26] [27] DNA vaccines and viral-vectored vaccines use recombinant technology that allows for rapid vaccine design in response to emerging infectious diseases. DNA vaccines have additional advantages in rapid manufacture and avoidance of potential toxicities that might occur in live viral-vectored vaccines. Underscoring the potential for rapid deployment of DNA vaccines, GLS-5300 was advanced into the clinic within 9 months of pre-clinical vaccine candidate selection.",
