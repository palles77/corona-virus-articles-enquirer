            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly recognized illness that spread from southern China in late 2002/early 2003 to several countries in Asia, Europe and North America . SARS usually begins with a fever greater than 38 8C. Initial symptoms can also include headache, malaise, and mild respiratory symptoms. Within 2 days to a week, SARS patients may develop a dry cough and have trouble breathing. Patients in more advanced stages of SARS develop either pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome. In the initial outbreak, there were 8098 cases worldwide, with an overall mortality of 9.6% (http:// www.who.int/csr/sars/en/). A previously unrecognized coronavirus (CoV) has been demonstrated to be the cause of the new disease (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003) . In a remarkably short period of time, the entire genetic sequences of several strains of the novel SARS-CoV were determined and the virion receptor identified . Similar CoV have been isolated from civets and other animals that are trapped for food or medicine at live animal markets in Guangdong province China, the presumed epicenter of the outbreak . SARS-CoV or a closely related CoV also infects animals in the wild and appears to have entered the human population in the past (Zheng et al., 2004) .",

Therefore, to develop better treatment strategies for future outbreaks, it is imperative to understand the relationship between the 0042-6822/$ -see front matter D 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.virol.2004.08.011 virus and the host immune system. Type I IFNs (IFN-a and IFN-h) and type II IFN (IFN-g) are important components of the host immune response to viral infections. IFN-a and IFN-h are produced by most cells as a direct response to viral infection, while IFN-g is synthesized almost exclusively by activated natural killer (NK) cells and activated T cells in response to virusinfected cells (Pfeffer et al., 1998) . Both types of IFNs achieve their antiviral effects by inducing the synthesis of several proteins that interfere with viral replication (Goodbourn et al., 2000) . Several studies have examined the anti-viral effects of IFNs against SARS-CoV. Although results from clinical studies using IFN-a are inconclusive (Haagmans et al., 2004; Loutfy et al., 2003) , in vitro studies strongly suggest that IFN-h at concentrations greater than 1000 U/ml can marginally inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV Hensley et al., 2004; Spiegel et al., 2004; Stroher et al., 2004) . Likewise, analysis of cytokine levels in SARS patients suggests that the presence of IFN-g at the early stages of disease onset correlates with resolution of the viral infection (D. Kelvin and M. Cameron, personal communication); however, IFN-g has little antiviral effect against SARS-CoV in vitro Spiegel et al., 2004) . Recent studies examining the anti-viral effects of IFNs against both RNA and DNA viruses have shown that when used in combination, IFN-g synergizes with the innate IFNs (IFN-a and IFN-h) to inhibit the replication of viruses such as herpes simplex virus type-1 (Sainz and Halford, 2002) , hepatitis C virus (Larkin et al., 2003) , Lassa virus (Asper et al., 2004) , and cytomegalovirus (Sainz et al., unpublished data) . To further test this principle, we examined the antiviral effects of recombinant IFN-h and/or IFN-g against SARS-CoV replication in vitro.",

Vero E6 cells were pre-treated for 12 h with 100 U/ml of IFNs separately or in combination, infected with SARS-CoV (Urbani or HK strain) at a MOI of 0.01 PFU per cell, and culture supernatants were titered for infectious virus at 24, 48 and 72 h p.i. In cultures treated with 100 U/ml of IFN-h or IFN-g, Urbani and HK replication was significantly inhibited (P b 0.001) at 24 and 48 h p.i., with the greatest level of inhibition observed in IFN-h treated cultures ( Figs (Fig. 2D) , and 5-and 2fold in HK-infected cultures, respectively (Fig. 2E ). As with our plaque reduction assays, we observed a potent inhibitory effect when Vero cultures were treated with both IFN-h and IFN-g. Compared to viral titers of greater than 1 \u00c2 10 5 PFU/ml in vehicle-treated cells, in cultures treated with 100 U/ml each of IFN-h and IFN-g, Urbani replicated to titers of 55, 11 and 6 PFU/ml at 24, 48 and 72 h p.i., respectively ( Fig. 2A) , and HK replicated to titers 324, 79 and 17 PFU/ml at 24, 48 and 72 h p.i., respectively (Fig.  2B) . The inhibitory effect achieved with combination IFNh and IFN-g treatment was consistently greater than 3000fold at all time points tested and reached levels of greater than 1 \u00c2 10 5 -fold at 72 h p.i. relative to vehicle treated Vero E6 cells (Figs. 2D, E) . In contrast, when tested against MHV-A59, combination IFN-h and IFN-g treatment showed only a 8-10-fold increased antiviral effect when compared to cultures treated with IFN-h or IFN-g separately (Figs. 2C, F). Similar results were obtained on 17CL-1 cells (data not shown). Although this result would suggest that the synergistic antiviral effect observed in cultures treated with both IFN-h and IFN-g is specific to SARS-CoV, we cannot exclude the possibility that the effect observed with regards to MHV plaque formation and replication is cell type-specific.",

For example, a synergistic relationship would exist if the level of inhibition achieved with 100 U/ml of IFN-h plus 100 U/ml of IFN-g were significantly greater than the level of inhibition achieved with 200 U/ml of either IFN-h or IFN-g separately. The plaque reduction data presented in Table 1 support this inequality and suggest a synergistic antiviral relationship between type I and type II IFNs with regards to SARS-CoV plaque formation. Likewise, the fold-inhibition data presented in Fig. 2 strongly supports the hypothesis that IFN-h and IFN-g synergistically inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV. Specifically, if the observed effect were additive, then the level of inhibition in viral replication predicted for cultures treated with 100 U/ml of both IFN-h and IFN-g would be equal to the sum of the level of inhibition achieved in culture treated with 100 U/ml of IFN-h and IFN-g separately. For both Urbani and HK (Figs. 2D, E) , the level of inhibition achieved in cultures treated with 100 U/ml of both IFN-h and IFN-g was approximately 1000 times greater than the sum of the foldinhibition achieved in cultures treated with 100 U/ml of IFNh and IFN-g separately (Pb0.001).

We hypothesize that the difference in CPE may be reflective of the different IFN pathways used by each IFN respectively, and may be an essential factor when considering the mechanism by which IFN-h and IFN-g synergistically inhibit SARS-CoV replication. Type I IFNs (IFN-a and IFN-h) and type II IFN (IFN-g) activate distinct but related Jak/STAT signal cascades resulting in the transcription of several hundred IFN-stimulated genes (Goodbourn et al., 2000) . Although similar genes are activated by all three IFNs, Der, et al. have identified numerous genes differentially regulated by IFN-a, IFN-h or IFN-g using oligonucleotide arrays (Der et al., 1998) . In particular, IFNh stimulation resulted in the identification of twice as many genes as compared to IFN-g. This differential regulation of IFN-induced genes may explain in part the synergistic effect achieved with both IFN-h and IFN-g. It remains to be determined, however, the profile of different IFN-stimulated genes present in cells treated with both type I and type II IFNs.",

It is unknown, however, whether these draconian containment measures can be sustained with each appearance of the SARS-CoV in humans. The immune response to SARS-CoV infection appears capable of clearing the infection in most individuals. By reducing SARS-CoV load it may be possible to extend the window of time during which an effective immune response could arise. Thus, treatments that reduce SARS-CoV load by several logs in infected individuals could enable more individuals to control, eliminate and survive SARS-CoV infections. Combination IFN treatment therefore warrants further consideration as a treatment for SARS.",
