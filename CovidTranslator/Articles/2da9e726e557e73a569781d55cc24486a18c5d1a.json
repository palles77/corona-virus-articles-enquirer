CPMV was first isolated from an infected cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) plant in Nigeria in 1959. Subsequently, it has been found to occur in Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, Japan, Surinam, and Cuba. While its natural host is cowpea, it can infect other legumes, and Nicotiana benthamiana has proven to be an extremely valuable experimental host. In nature, CPMV is usually transmitted by leaf-feeding beetles, especially by members of the Chrysomelidae. CPMV has also been reported to be transmitted by thrips and grasshoppers. The beetle vectors can acquire the virus by feeding for as little as one minute and can retain and transmit the virus for a period of days or weeks. The virus does not, however, multiply in the insect vector. Experimentally, CPMV is mechanically transmissible.",

Overall, the virions are icosahedral, with 12 axes of fivefold and 20 axes of threefold symmetry, and resemble a classic T \u00bc 3 particle. The two coat proteins taken together consist of three distinct b-barrel domains, two being derived from the L and one from the S protein. Thus, in common with the T \u00bc 3 viruses, each CPMV particle is made up of 180 b-barrel structures. The S protein, with its single domain, is found at the fivefold symmetry axes and therefore occupies a position analogous to that of the A-type subunits in T \u00bc 3 particles (Figure 2 ). The N-and C-termini domains of the L protein occur at the threefold axes and occupy the positions equivalent to those of the C-and B-type subunits of a T \u00bc 3 particle, respectively ( Figure 2 ). This detailed analysis confirmed the earlier suggestion that CPMV particles are structurally homologous to those of picornaviruses, with the N-and C-terminal domains of the L protein being equivalent to viral protein VP2 and viral protein VP3, respectively, and the S protein being equivalent to viral protein VP1 ( Figure 2 ). However, CPMV particles are structurally less complex than those of picornaviruses. The L and S subunits lack the extended N-and C-termini found in VP2, VP3, and VP1 of picornaviruses and there is no equivalent of VP4. Moreover, CPMV subunits lack the relatively large insertions between the strands of b-sheet, sequences that form the major antigenic determinants of picornaviruses. No RNA is visible in either the M or B components of CPMV, in contrast to the situation found with BPMV where segments of ordered RNA could be detected in middle components.",

Both genomic RNAs have a small basic protein (VPg) covalently linked to their 5 0 termini and both are polyadenylated at their 3 0 ends. The elucidation of the overall structure of the RNA segments once more underscored the similarity between CPMV and picornaviruses. However, unlike picornaviruses, the VPg is linked to the viral RNA via the b-hydroxyl group of its N-terminal serine residue rather than via a tyrosine.

A combination of in vitro translation and protoplast studies has unraveled the basic mechanism of gene expression of the virus. Both RNAs of CPMV are expressed through the synthesis and subsequent cleavage of large precursor polyproteins. This was the first example of a plant virus using this strategy for the expression of its genome, a strategy that was subsequently shown to be used by a number of other plant viruses. On RNA-1, initiation of translation occurs at the first AUG encountered on the sequence (at position 207) and results in the synthesis of a protein of approximately 200 kDa (the 200K protein). This initial product undergoes rapid cotranslational autoproteolysis to give proteins with apparent sizes of 32 and 170 kDa (the 32K and 170K proteins). The 170K protein undergoes further cleavages to give the range of virus-specific proteins shown in Figure 3 . In vitro translation studies using mutant RNA-1 molecules have shown that all the cleavages occur most efficiently in cis. The 170K product can initially be cleaved at three different sites to give three different combinations of secondary cleavage products, 58K \u00fe 112K, 60K \u00fe 110K, and 84K \u00fe 87K.",

This double initiation phenomenon, which occurs as a result of 'leaky scanning', is found with the RNA-2 molecules of all comoviruses. In the case of CPMV, synthesis of the 105K protein is initiated from an AUG at position 161 while initiation from an AUG at position 512 directs the synthesis of the 95K protein. CPMV RNA-2 has an additional AUG (position 115) upstream of both these initiation sites but this feature is not conserved in the RNA-2 molecules of other comoviruses. Both RNA-2-encoded primary translation products are cleaved by the RNA-1-encoded proteolytic activity to give either the 58K or the 48K protein (depending on whether it is the 105K or 95K protein that is being processed) and the two viral coat proteins. Processing of the RNA-2-encoded polyproteins, at least at the site between the 48K and L coat protein, has been shown to require the presence of the 32K protein as well as the 24K proteinase.",

In the case of RNA-1, the 32K protein, which is rapidly cleaved from the N-terminus of the 200K primary translation product, is a cofactor which modulates the activity of the virus-encoded protease. As described earlier, the presence of the 32K protein is required for the cleavage of the RNA-2-encoded 105K and 95K proteins but is not essential for the cleavage of the RNA-1-encoded 170K protein. It does, however, seem to play a role in determining the rate at which cleavage of the 170K protein occurs. When mutant RNA-1 molecules carrying deletions in the region encoding the 32K protein are translated in vitro, the rate of processing of the 170K protein is greatly increased, indicating that the 32K protein acts as an inhibitor of processing. This inhibition may be achieved through the interaction of the 32K with the 58K domain of the 170K protein.

The 24K protein is the virus-encoded proteinase that carries out all the cleavages on both the RNA-1-and RNA-2-encoded polyproteins. Its proteolytic activity has been shown to be expressed in a number of the processing intermediates that contain its sequence. Indeed, it is not known whether the free form of the protein has any biological significance. Although the proteinase contains a cysteine at its active site, it is structurally related to serine proteases, such as trypsin, rather than cellular thiol proteases, such as papain. In this regard, it is similar to the 3C proteinases of picornaviruses. All comoviral cleavage sites identified so far have glutamine (Q) residue at the -1 position.

Tubules extending into the culture medium can also be seen in protoplasts either infected with CPMV or transiently expressing the 48K protein. Virus particles can be seen within these tubules when protoplasts are infected with CPMV but not when only 48K protein is expressed. At present, no definite role has been assigned to the 58K protein, which is produced by processing of the 105K protein. Mutants in which translation of the 105K protein is disrupted replicate poorly, if at all. In light of these observations, it has been suggested that the 105K protein may play a role in the replication of RNA-2. Apart from containing many hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids, the approximately 10 kDa of protein present in the 58K but absent from the 48K protein is not conserved between comoviruses.

Members of this superfamily are all nonenveloped positive-strand RNA viruses with 3 0 polydenylated genomic RNAs, which have a protein (VPg) covalently linked to their 5 0 ends. All members of the supergroup have a similar mode of gene expression, which involves the synthesis of large precursor polyproteins and their subsequent cleavage by a virus-encoded proteinase. The members of the superfamily all contain similar gene order, membrane-bound protein-VPg-proteinase-polymerase (see Figure 3 ) and share significant amino acid sequence homology in the membrane-bound proteins, the proteinases, and polymerase coding regions. Comovirus capsids are also clearly structurally related to those of picornaviruses ( Figure 2 ).",

When injected into experimental animals, CVPs can elicit the production of antibodies against the inserted epitope and in a number of instances can confer protective immunity against the pathogen from which the epitope was derived.

Jenner described the clinical signs of cowpox in both hosts, and how infection in man with Variolae vaccinae ('known by the name of the cowpox') provided protection against smallpox. At that time, smallpox was responsible for between 200 000 and 600 000 deaths each year in Europe and about 10% of all deaths in children. Jenner's discovery, despite the concern of some over the consequences of inoculating bovine material into man, soon led to the establishment of smallpox vaccination schemes around the world. However, not until Pasteur's work c. 100 years later was the principle of immunization used again. In fact, it was Pasteur who suggested that all such immunizations be called vaccines in honor of Jenner's work.Although Jenner's first vaccines probably came indirectly from cattle, later vaccine material was often derived from horses, and the origin(s) of modern vaccinia virus (VACV) the smallpox vaccine, remain unknown. That cowpox virus (CPXV) and VACV are different was first published in 1939, since when further biological and genetic studies have confirmed that VACV represents a species in its own right, and is not simply a mutant of CPXV or a recombinant of variola virus (VARV) and CPVX.Even Jenner seems to have had difficulty finding cowpox cases, and CPXV is not endemic in cattle. Rather, it is endemic in rodents, and cattle and man are merely accidental hosts. The domestic cat is the animal diagnosed most frequently with clinical cowpox in Europe.",
