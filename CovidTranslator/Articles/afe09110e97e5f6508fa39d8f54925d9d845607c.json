The viscous forces of molecules and viruses dominate at considerably low Reynolds numbers. This study developed three microfluidic devices, that is, T type, U type, and W type devices, to control the flow movement, which can increase the adhesion density of viruses on the surface of the sensor. The linker 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (11-MUA) and Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) were used in this study and measured by a confocal microscope. Fluorescent intensity and coverage of 11-MUA and TYMV were used to identify the adhesion density quantitatively. Results indicate that 11-MUA layers and TYMV disperse randomly by the dipping method. Attachment tests for T-, U-, and W-type devices demonstrated average fluorescence intensities of 1.56, 2.18, and 2.67, respectively, and average fluorescence coverage of 1.31, 1.87, and 2.55 times those of dipping techniques, respectively. The T-type device produced the lowest fluorescence coverage uniformity (10%-80%), whereas the W-type device produced the highest fluorescence coverage uniformity (80%-90%). Fluorescence intensity correlates positively with flow within a specified flow range; however, the exact relationship between fluorescence intensity and flow requires further study. Attachment tests for TYMV virus samples indicated that the W-type device produced an average fluorescence intensity of 3.59 and average fluorescence coverage of 19.13 times greater than those achieved through dipping techniques. Traditional immersion methods achieved fluorescence coverage of 0%-10%, whereas that of the W-type device reached 70%-90%. V C 2012 American Institute of Physics. [http://dx.",

Each antibody can be distinguished and bound by its matched antigen, and the function is commonly used to detect the presence of viruses in a sample. A known quantity of captured antibodies is first bounded on the surface, and antigen-containing viruses are subsequently washed over the surface to bind the viruses to the surface. After the viruses are affixed on the surface, primary antibodies and enzyme-linked secondary antibodies are applied to bind specifically to the viruses. The secondary antibodies are linked to enzymes that can convert to detectable signals. For fluorescence ELISA, antigen/antibody complexes fluoresce when light of the appropriate wavelength is shown on the sample. The amount of antigens in the sample can be inferred through the magnitude of the fluorescence.",

            "text": "Western blotting is the other commonly used method in the study of viruses. In Western blotting (Burnette et al., 1981; Towbin et al., 1979) , the virus samples are separated by using gel electrophoresis, such as SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and subsequently transferred to a membrane (typically nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene fluoride, PVDF). The membrane is dipped into a buffer liquid with primary antibodies to target viruses. The membrane is exposed to secondary antibodies after it is rinsed to remove unbound primary antibodies. The secondary antibodies are linked to biotins or to reporter enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase. In the last step, a sensitive sheet of photographic film is placed against the membrane. The sheet is exposed to the light to create images of viruses. However, ELISA and Western blotting require several experimental steps, longer processing times, expensive detection equipment and well-trained expertise. The sensitivity is occasionally not satisfied for real-time detection. Researchers must duplicate large numbers of viruses to satisfy the sensitivity of the sensor. However, these steps substantially increase the total processing times and may risk the health of researchers.",

Another advantage of these methods is the ease with which they can be integrated with microchannels, and thus, form a pathogen diagnosis and analysis system (Lee et al., 2009a (Lee et al., , 2009b Julich et al., 2011) . Li and Su (2006) applied traditional ELISA theory with the microchannels formed by silicon and glass to detect Escherichia coli 0157:H7. Gao et al. (2005) used electrokinetically driven actuators combined with the indirect ELISA theory to detect various antigens from Helicobacter pylori and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (control group). The lowest detected concentration was 1 ng/ml, and the higher the concentration of H. pylori, the stronger the detected fluorescence signal. Eteshol and Leckband (2001) applied the PDMS microchannel to the theory of heterogeneous sandwich ELISA to detect the Sheep IgM antigen in the test solution; and the detected concentration of the antigen was as high as 15 ng/ml. Niemeyer and Ceyhan (2001) used the scanometric approach to detect proteins. Specific antibodies for target proteins were immobilized on a surface. After the target proteins were bound to the capture antibodies, antibody-labeled gold nanoparticles were bound to the proteins to generate a sandwich system. The use of either spectrophotometrically or a scanner resulted in a detection limit of approximately 200 pM, which is comparable with ELISA.",

Several recognized layers (for example, self-assembled monolayers, specific linkers, and antibodies) were first deposited on the surface of the biosensor, and impedance of the biosensor was measured before and after adhesion of biological agents. Edwards et al. (2001) applied a microchannel with two electrodes within a fixed pitch. The presence of pathogens in the test solution can be detected by measuring electrical changes when pathogens pass the pitch between the electrodes. Chang et al. (2005) first modified an RGD-C peptide on an electrode to increase the amount of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells adhering to the electrodes to facilitate electrical measurement. In other studies on electrical measurement, the link action between antibody and antigen was also used to fix the pathogens in the test solution in the target area (Suehiro et al., 2006; Javanmard et al., 2007) . Yun et al. (2007) used highly aligned multiwalled carbon nanotubes as electrodes to develop a label-free immunosensor. Anti-mouse IgG was subsequently covalently immobilized on the nanotube electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to measure the binding of mouse IgG, and a detection limit of 200 ng/ml was obtained.",

            "text": "Regardless of whether optical or electrical measurement methods were used, the measurement signals were occasionally too weak and difficult to judge when the volume of microorganisms in the sensing area was considerably low. Traditional biological detection methods are generally based on the principle of soaking the antigen-antibody and fixing the microbial molecules to the sensor area. Because of the influence of Brownian motion, for microbial molecules in static liquid, relying on diffusion movement to attach the biological molecules to the sensing area requires considerable time, and the likelihood of successful dispersion on the sensing area is low. Tabeling (2005) argued that when a fluid flows through a square-shaped downward concave slot, the fluid causes a degree of swirling flow in the corner of the slot, and the side length ratio of the square-shaped slot influences the flow state of the fluid in the slot. Bruus (2008) also observed that the fluid created a swirling flow in the corner of the square-shaped slot when the Reynolds number of the microchannel increased. The effect turn on vortices was also investigated in the literature recently. Tsai and Wu (2011) developed a planar micromixer based on multidirectional vortices in a curved channel. They demonstrated that the C-shaped microchannel with several inner micro-barriers could enhance the efficiency on mixing two different fluorescent solutions. Buchegger et al. (2012) presented an enzymatic bioreactor using a millisecond microfluidic flow mixer. A novel passive T-mixer was developed to reduce mixing time at low Reynolds number. The formation of fluid layers enabled fast mixing and enhanced the reaction of enzymatic bioreactors. Jiang et al. (2011) used an optical detection technique using twophoton fluorescence imaging microscopy to depict two-dimensional maps of mixing dynamics by chaotic advection in microdroplet. The chaotic advection inside microdroplets introduced by the periodic flow in terms of two symmetric or asymmetric vortices inside microdroplets moving through a serpentine channel was measured experimentally and matched well with theoretical and computational results. Static mixers are also an alternative way to produce high vortical shear. Cheng and Chang (2011) designed a mixer with a special pattern to mix two types liquid (H \u00fe and OH \u00c0 ) to adjust pH value in the microchannel. They demonstrated electrokinetic control of fluid pH and generation of stable pH gradients across flow chambers.",

The succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) could conjugate with the linker which has the amino group derived from lysine. After the reaction, the maleimide-activated linker can link to the thiol group of TYMV particle. Quantum dots with modified amino group on the surface can be linked with the same function. These amino groups can be easily linked with antibodies and quantum dots. Alexa 594 was applied to the TYMV with the amino groups to examine the virus distribution under a confocal microscope. The other type of fluorescent was NCD-4 (N-Cyclohexyl-N-4-Dime-thylamino naphthyl carbodiimide), and it can also be linked with TYMV by the carboxy groups on the TYMV. The selfassembled monolayers (SAMs) and the linker were used to affix the virus to the sensing surface in the microfluidics channel. The type of SAMs used in this paper was 11-MUA. At one end of the chemical structure of 11-MUA are thiol groups, which can be attached on the gold film of the sensing surface. At the other end of the 11-MUA is a carboxyl functional group. This functional group can form a connection between the linker and 11-MUA. The linker layer was EDC (1-Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide Hydrochloride) and NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide). The TYMV were captured by the designed SAMs after EDC interacted with 11-MUA. The compound NHS was used to prevent EDC layer hydrolysis. Therefore, we achieved a connection between the virus and the sensing surface. After the virus with quantum dots was anchored to the sensing surface of the microfluidics channel, a confocal microscope was used to monitor the surface of the silicon membrane. A laser beam with a wavelength of 615 nm was passed through an aperture and was focused by an objective lens onto a small focal volume on the sensor surface. A mixture of emitted fluorescent lights (594 nm) and reflected laser lights from the quantum dots were subsequently re-obtained by the objective lens.

Random molecular motion results in an uneven response. High soaking concentrations result in molecular aggregation. When small molecules become large molecules, the diameters increase in conjunction with the Reynolds numbers of particles. When the inertia force (gravity) is greater than the viscous force of the fluid, the random movements result in macromolecules depositing on the wafer surface, leading to a reaction of local aggregation.

The design was based on extending the flow path as an extension of the U-type microchannel. The reduction of the cross-sectional microflow area increased the flow resistance. For the respective input flows, the fluid pressure for a specific channel wall is greater than in other microchannel structures. Most of the fluid molecules in the reaction zone followed the 12 mm basic flow path. The W-type devices have more uniform flow rates and denser flow line in the channel in the results of finite element simulation. If viruses or antibodies are distributed uniformly in the flow, more uniform flow rates, and the denser flow distribution indicates that more viruses or antibodies will be carried in the reaction zone. We assume that W-type microchannel differs from other structures because it exhibits superior flow distribution in the reaction zone. In the rest paragraph of the article, we also find the W-type microchannels exhibited regional fluorescence coverage of 80% to 90% which is the best results among dipping method, U-type device and T-type device. Although the deviation from the central axis of the entrance is specified, the flow rate can be maintained at a certain level.

The advantage of photolithography is its high precision; however, the disadvantages are the manufacturing complexity and low reusability of the mold. Based on the requirements of this study, we used micromachining systems to simplify the process and created a reusable master pattern. First, stainless steel or brass was processed by a computer numerical control (CNC) milling machine to produce the inserts designed in the study.

Compared to traditional immersion methods, this approach considerably improved the attachment efficiency in the samples. Attachment tests for NCD-4 fluorescence for T-, U-, and W-type microchannels revealed average fluorescence intensities of 1.56, 2.18, and 2.67, and average fluorescence coverage of 1.31, 1.87, and 2.55 times that of traditional immersion techniques, respectively. The T-type microchannels produced the lowest fluorescence coverage uniformity (10-80%), whereas the W-type microchannels produced the highest fluorescence coverage uniformity (80%-90%). Within a specific flow range, fluorescence intensity correlated positively with flow; however, the exact relationship between fluorescence intensity and flow requires further study. Attachment tests for TYMV virus samples indicated that the W-type microchannel produced an average fluorescence intensity of 3.59 and average fluorescence coverage of 19.13 times greater than those achieved through traditional immersion techniques. Traditional immersion methods achieved fluorescence coverage of 0% to 10%, whereas that of the W-type microchannel reached 70% to 90%.",
