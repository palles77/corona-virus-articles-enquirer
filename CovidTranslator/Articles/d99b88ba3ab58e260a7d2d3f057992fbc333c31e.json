            "text": "The in vitro tests most commonly used to determine the target of action of anti-HIV drugs are assays measuring the activity of the following viral enzymes: reverse transcriptase (RT) (polymerase and RNaseH activity) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , integrase 8, 9 and protease 10 . The advantage of these enzymatic assays in the test tube is that they are straightforward to perform, do not require any special safety infrastructure and produce clear interpretable results. However, if there are no previous indications of the presumed target of a new drug, it is difficult to know with which assay to start. In that case, viral resistance is selected against the inhibitor and the target of action is then needed to be determined by sequence analysis, which is time-consuming and cumbersome. Currently, many other test-tube assays have been described for measuring the distinct interactions (protein-protein, RNA-protein) that are essential for viral replication, and new assays are being developed 11,12 . However, on the basis of test-tube studies of mechanisms of action, several compounds have been mistakenly ascribed to inhibit a certain target that, upon further study in cell culture, appeared to inhibit an off-site target. For example, suramin was first found to be a very potent inhibitor of the retroviral reverse transcription process in the test tube and to block the in vitro infectivity and cytopathic effect of HIV 3, 13 . It was not only the first antiviral drug to be shown in vitro to block HIV infection but was also the first to be proven effective in suppressing HIV replication in HIVinfected patients 14 . Although suramin was originally pursued for its anti-HIV potential because of its RT-inhibitory capacity, it has since become clear that, in cell culture, suramin primarily targets the viral adsorption step 15 involving the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 (ref. 16) . Another example is the Tat inhibitor CGP64222 (ref. 17 ), shown to target viral entry in cell culture 18 . Yet another example is l-chicoric acid and its derivatives, which counteract HIV-1 integrase activity in vitro but in cell culture block virus entry 19, 20 . Therefore, tools to characterize the mechanism of action of virus inhibitors in cell culture are required to define their correct targets of action 21 .",

For example, by comparing the activity of a compound on acutely 1 versus persistently or latently infected cells [22] [23] [24] , it can be easily determined whether an inhibitor targets a pre-or a postintegrational step of the viral replication cycle 25 . A drug blocking the production of a new virus from persistently infected cells presumably targets a postintegrational event because in the persistent infection system all preintegrational steps, such as virus binding, reverse transcription and integration, are omitted. Alternatively, for several steps in the HIV replication cycle (e.g., virus binding 26 , integration 21 , transcription 27 and viral budding 28 ), there exist specific tests in cells that can be performed to study the effect of a potential inhibitor of this target. For example, if one presumes that a newly discovered inhibitor interferes with virus binding, a virus-binding assay 26 can be performed. However, none of these assays combine all these properties in just one test that covers a full replication cycle.",

A single round of HIV-1 replication takes ~24 h (Fig. 1) . Therefore, the standard protocol of a TOA experiment is based on the bulk infection of susceptible cells for 1 h; this is followed by removing the unbound virus and subsequent dispensing of the infected cells in a 96-well tissue culture plate and adding test compounds at 0, 1, 2, 3,\u2026, 24 h after virus infection. Further, the extent of virus replication is monitored at 31 h after infection. To synchronize the infection in all conditions, it is a prerequisite to wash out all unbound virus at 1 h after infection. The distinct steps of the procedure are detailed in Figure 2 . Key to the success of the experiment and to obtaining a maximal viral output that can be reliably measured is the use of: a highly susceptible cell line, e.g., the human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-transformed MT-4 cell line; a high multiplicity of infection (0.5-1); and an optimal harvest time. For HIV, the newly produced virus is harvested 31 h after infection (Fig. 1) to ensure that only one replication cycle has been completed.",

Fusion of the viral envelope with the cellular membrane ensues, and the viral core penetrates into the cytoplasm. The single-stranded RNA genome of the virus is copied into a double-stranded linear DNA molecule by the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase. Next, the DNA is transported to the nucleus as a nucleic acid-protein complex (the preintegration complex) and is integrated into the host cell's genome by the action of a second viral enzyme, integrase. The covalently integrated form of viral DNA, which is defined as the provirus, serves as the template for transcription. The viral Tat protein stimulates transcription, and retroviral RNAs are synthesized, processed and then transported with the support of the viral protein Rev to the cytoplasm, where they are translated to produce the viral proteins. The proteins that form the viral core, encoded by the gag and pol genes, initially assemble into immature particles together with two copies of the full-length viral RNA. As these structures bud through the plasma membrane, they become enveloped by a lipid bilayer from the cell membrane that also harbors the viral Env glycoproteins in the form of trimers. Concomitantly with virus assembly and budding, the viral protease cleaves the Gag and Gag-Pol precursors to release the structural core proteins and pol enzymes in their final processed forms, resulting in a fully matured and infectious virus particle. an insufficient inhibition of viral replication. Moreover we recommend checking the solubility of the compound in aqueous medium at the intended concentration, as precipitation reduces the final concentration of the compound.",

            "text": "This protocol enables the target of action of newly discovered antiviral drugs to be determined in cell culture. For example, the RT inhibitor AZT is able to inhibit the replication of HIV-1 when it is present within the first 3 h of infection (Fig. 3b) ; on the contrary, when it is added at 4 h after infection or later, it is unable to inhibit the viral replication because its target of action (the reverse transcription process) has already occurred and the target is no longer of importance for the further replication of the virus in a single round of infection. It should be pointed out that it is imperative to include control drugs with a known and well-characterized target of action in each experiment. When a drug with an unknown target of action shows a similar profile to the established anti-HIV agent, it strongly suggests that this drug targets the same process or at least targets one that is operative at the same time. Most notably, using this assay makes it possible to discriminate between an RT inhibitor of the nucleoside RT inhibitor type (NRTI) versus NNRTI type (Fig. 3) . Indeed, we have consistently observed in all experiments that NRTIs (2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxynucleoside (ddN) analogs) lose their antiviral activity exactly 1 h before that of any NNRTI. This is most likely because of the fact that ddN analogs need to undergo phosphorylation by cellular enzymes before becoming active, as chain terminators, in the RT reaction. One should keep in mind that for drugs with a dual target of action, i.e., one molecule targeting two distinct steps within the replication cycle, always the last occurring target in the viral replication will be revealed by this experiment, as this is the last step at which replication can be blocked by the inhibitor. To illustrate this point, several combinations of two wellknown HIV inhibitors were combined in one experiment (Fig. 4) . In the case of dextran sulfate (an inhibitor of viral entry) combined with AZT (an RT inhibitor), the TOA assay only reveals reverse transcription as a target for this combination. For AZT combined with L-870,810 (an integrase inhibitor), only the integrase is revealed as a target. A special example of drugs with a dual mechanism of action are polysulfonate dendrimers, which at low concentrations in cell culture inhibit the viral adsorption but when added at higher concentrations also target a process coinciding with the viral reverse transcription (Fig. 5) 34 . This can be explained by both the extent of cellular uptake of the drug(s) at different concentrations and their differential potency against different processes. Therefore, in a TOA experiment, it is advised to test compounds at different concentrations.",

Even when no complete inhibition of viral replication can be established with a certain compound, a satisfactory and reliable result could be obtained in this TOA assay. In this case, one can expect to see a residual amount of p24 at time points occurring before the target of the compound that is not zero (only reached when there is a 100% block of viral replication) but lower than in the control without the compound. It is also possible that sometimes a slight slope in loss of activity will be observed instead of a clear jump. This can be because of toxicity of the compound or because the compound is targeting a step in the viral replication that involves an iterative process that takes place for several hours. Many variations of the TOA experiment can be envisaged, e.g., a so-called negative TOA experiment can be performed for drugs that need time to be processed by the host cell to become active in the cells. In such an experiment, the compound is added at different time points before the virus infection takes place. A similar approach can be used when the mechanism of action of a compound is based on the down-or upregulation of a cellular co-factor involved in viral replication. In addition, shorter time periods between compound addition (15 or 30 min) can be used instead of the 1-h interval. Figure 5 | Result obtained with a polyanionic dendrimer targeting two steps in the viral replication depending on the concentration tested. At low concentrations, the BRI2923 blocks virus entry, whereas at higher concentrations, it also targets the viral reverse transcription process. Dextran sulfate and AZT were included as reference compounds for virus entry and reverse transcription.",

Next, infected cells were incubated for different time periods as indicated, and the produced (released) virus in the supernatant was quantified by monitoring the virus-associated Gag core p24 antigen. From 26 h after infection, an exponential increase in virus released in the supernatant of the infected cells was observed, demonstrating that one round of virus replication roughly encompasses 1 d.",

A well is scored positive if any trace of cytopathogenic effect is observed, as compared with the uninfected control. The CCID 50 is calculated using the Reed and Muench method43 as follows: M = inv log{x 1 + [(x 2 \u2212 x 1 ) ((y 1 \u2212 50)/y 1 \u2212 y 2 )]}. In this equation, y 1 is the percentage of wells scored positive closest to but higher than 50% at a certain virus dilution; y 2 is the percentage of wells scored positive closest to but lower than 50% at a certain virus dilution; x 1 is the log from the dilution of the virus in which y 1 was observed; x 2 is the log from the dilution of the virus in which y 2 was observed; and M is the dilution of virus stock that results in 1 CCID 50 . The amount of virus required for a time-of-addition experiment is expressed as multiplicity of infection, which refers to the number of infectious virus particles (or plaque-forming units, PFUs) per cell during infection. If 50 infectious particles (50 PFUs) are added to 100 cells, the multiplicity of infection is 0.5. The CCID 50 is defined as the virus dose that is able to infect 50% of the cell cultures. Therefore, a virus stock would be expected to contain half of the number of infectious particles (PFUs) as CCID 50 . However, the distribution of virus in an infection occurs by a Poisson distribution. Therefore, a better estimate to convert CCID 50 to PFU is by multiplying the CCID 50 by 0.7 to predict the PFU: 1 CCID 50 equals 0.7 PFU or 1.43 CCID 50 is 1 PFU. proceDure sample preparation \u2022 tIMInG 35 min 1| Prepare a solution of the test compounds at, preferentially, 1,000-fold their IC 50 in complete medium.

For 7 compounds + 1 no-compound control and 11 time points, 8 \u00d7 11 = 88 wells are needed, this yields a total of 88 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 4 = 8.8 \u00d7 10 6 cells. Virus A multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 is required, meaning that one in two cells should be infected. Thus, for 10 \u00d7 10 4 cells, the addition of virus at 7.2 \u00d7 10 4 CCID 50 is needed (see Box 2). The CCID 50 of a virus stock is determined by titration and by using the Reed and Muench method 43 . For a protocol on how to titrate virus, see Box 2 and reference 1. For example, if the CCID 50 of the virus stock is 8 \u00d7 10 5 , an 11-fold dilution of the stock is needed to reach a CCID 50 of 7.2 \u00d7 10 4 in the experiment. Thus, the final volume in the wells is 222 \u00b5l (200 \u00b5l cells and virus + 22 \u00b5l compound suspension) and there are 88 wells for an experiment with 7 compounds + 1 no-compound control and 11 time points, yielding a total volume of 19,536 \u00b5l. Virus stock dilution is 11-fold as calculated above; this means 1,776 \u00b5l (19,536 \u00d7 1/11) of virus stock is necessary. The required number of cells, 8.8 \u00d7 10 6 cells, are pelleted by centrifugation, the supernatant is removed by decanting and the cells are resuspended in 17,600 \u00b5l (88 wells \u00d7 200 \u00b5l) \u2212 1,776 \u00b5l (the volume of virus suspension) = 15,824 \u00b5l of complete medium.
