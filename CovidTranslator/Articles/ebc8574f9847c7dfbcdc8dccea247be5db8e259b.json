In the current study, sodium pentaborate pentahydrate and triclosan are applied to cotton fabrics in order to gain antimicrobial and antiviral properties for the first time. The antimicrobial activity of textiles treated with 3 % sodium pentaborate pentahydrate, 0.03 % triclosan, and 7 % Glucapon has been investigated against a broad range of microorganisms including bacteria, yeast, and fungi. Moreover, modified cotton fabrics were tested against adenovirus type 5 and poliovirus type 1. According to the test results, the modified textile goods attained very good antimicrobial and antiviral properties. Thus, the results of the present study clearly suggest that sodium pentaborate pentahydrate and triclosan solution-treated textiles can be considered in the development of antimicrobial and antiviral textile finishes.",

Also, several sulfated polysaccharides and copolymers of acrylic acid with vinyl alcohol sulfate have been demonstrated to have antiviral activity against human cytomegalovirus (CMV) [31] . However, there is lack of knowledge and study about antiviral textile products so far. Occurrence of polio and vaccinia virus on wool and cotton fabrics has been investigated previously. These viruses were recovered up to 20 and 14 weeks, respectively, from wool fabrics that were exposed to the virus, but they persisted for shorter periods of time on the cotton fabrics [10] . Imai et al. investigated the effect of cotton textiles treated with copper ion-exchanged zeolites on the inactivation of avian influenza virus (AIVs), and they showed that highly pathogenic H5N1 and low pathogenic H5N3 viruses were inactivated on the copper ion-exchanged zeolite textile materials even after short incubations [16] .",

Triclosan amount attached to the surface of the fabric was determined as 0.0243 %. Figure 2 shows the HPLC chromotogram for triclosan recovered from treated textile surface. HPLC chromotogram represents the triclosan peak relevant to the active compound for the retentition time at 2.97 min. Known concentrations of triclosan standards were overlayed with textile samples, and triclosan amounts of samples were obtained. Unfortunately, the mechanism of action of boron compounds against microorganisms is not totally understood, but previous reports support the antimicrobial activity. Remarkable antimicrobial activity against a wide range of microorganisms including bacteria (both gram positive and gram negative), fungi, and yeast have been stated [7, 9, 15] . Due to the large surface area and ability to retain moisture, textiles become a favorable medium for the growth of microorganisms on the fabric. Thus, scientists study antimicrobial textiles to control microbial growth, to prevent odors and discolorations caused by microorganisms and moreover to diminish the threat to public health [41] . Despite antimicrobial activity of boron compounds being reported in a few studies, there is no study about antimicrobial textile goods treated with boron compounds up to now.",

In the current study, the Triclosan has no or weak antimicrobial effect against Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger. However, due to the strong antimicrobial effect of SPP against these microorganisms, SPP + T combination-treated cotton textiles have shown remarkable inhibition zones around textile goods. As mentioned above, the antiviral tests were performed with AV-5 and PV-1. Initial AV-5 and PV-1 virus titers were both 5 log [10]/ml. Collected viral stocks that passed through the treated and untreated textiles were serially diluted and inoculated into HEp-2 cells. After 72 h, the antiviral effects were determined by the 50 % tissue culture-infected dose (TCID 50 ) and the virus-induced cell death was recorded by analyzing cell Table 3 ). Rate of decline in virus titers between wells was calculated by observing cell deaths. Figures 3 and 4 showed the view of death and viable cells at 72 h of AV-5 and PV-1 virus titers that were passed through the fabrics and serially diluted in 10-fold increments and the control groups. Even though antiviral activity of triclosan against a number of viruses has been studied previously [8, 17, 22] , there has not been any study about the antiviral activity of triclosantreated textile products so far. Just like triclosan, boron-containing compounds' antiviral activity has been indicated in a few studies. The boron-containing antibiotic, boromycin, was found as an antiviral agent against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strain in in vitro conditions [20] . Also, boronic acid antiviral activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been indicated previously [40] . However, there is no study that reveals the antiviral activity of textile materials treated with boron compounds, up to now.",

From this aspect, combination of 0.03 % T and 3 % SPP applied on textile materials should be effective against enveloped and non-enveloped DNA viruses such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), and they are assumed to be effective against enveloped and non-enveloped RNA viruses such as HIV, HCV, Ebola, MERS, and SARS. Further studies should be conducted for other types of woven and non-woven textile products. ",

Modified cotton textile fabrics showed antiviral activity against adenovirus type 5 and poliovirus type 1 and reduced both virus titers 60 %, while untreated fabrics cause no decline in viral titers. This formulation may be used not only in medical applications but also for manufacturing textile products of daily use and technical textiles. In the future, newly developed antimicrobial textiles are recommended for use in the military, health care, work/uniforms, home fashions and domestic products, and sports apparel. With these new technologies, the growing needs of the consumer in antimicrobial textile related to safety, human health, and environment are fulfilled.",
