In a recent report, proteasome inhibitor MG132 has been shown to completely inhibit IBDV-induced apoptosis. This raises the possibility that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may be used by the virus to promote viral replication. In this study, we examined the interplay between IBDV replication and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in cultured cells. Treatment of DF-1 cells with the proteasome inhibitors MG132 or lactacystin significantly decreased virus release in the supernatant and prevented virus-induced cytopathic effect. Inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway did reduce markedly viral RNA transcription and protein translation but not affect virus internalization. We also demonstrated that IBDV activates caspase pathway via triggering the efflux of cytochrome c in mitochondria into cytosol of infected cells. This activity was dose-dependently reduced by proteasome inhibitor treatment. Taken together, our data suggest that proteasome inhibitor reduces IBDV replication through inhibition of viral RNA transcription and protein synthesis, and thus preventing IBDV-induced apoptosis.",

The virus replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells and targets the precursors of antibody-producing B cells in the bursa of Fabricius (BF). Infection by this virus leads to a severe immunosuppression characterized by the destruction of B cells present in the BF. The induced immunodepression increases susceptibility to other pathogens [1] . Two distinct serotypes (I and II) are recognized for IBDV. The serotype I virus strains differ markedly in virulence, classic and very virulent IBDV strains cause hemorrhagic inflammation of the BF, whereas variant strains cause rapid bursal atrophy without evoking an inflammation response [1, 2] . In contrast to the serotype I, the serotype II viruses are naturally avirulent for chickens [3] . IBD is one of the most important diseases affecting the poultry industry worldwide.",

Segment A has two partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). The smaller ORF encodes VP5, a nonstructural protein of 17 kDa, which is not required for viral replication [4] . The larger ORF encodes a 110-kDa polyprotein precursor in the order NH 2 -pVP2-VP4-VP3-COOH. The polyprotein appears to be cotranslationally processed through the proteolytic activity of the viral protease, VP4, to generate pVP2, VP4, and VP3 [5] [6] [7] . pVP2, the VP2 precursor, is further processed at its C terminus to become VP2 through the cleavage of three alanine-alanine bonds and an alanine-phenylalanine bond [8] . VP2 and VP3 are structural proteins forming the virus capsid [6] . Segment B encodes VP1 which is known as a multifunctional protein with polymerase and capping enzyme activities [9, 10] .",

            "text": "To successfully infect a host, viruses have to both exploit the cellular resources and at the same time avoid defense reactions of the host organism. One of the common obstacles facing a virus is the overwhelming stoichiometric imbalance of the target proteins over those encoded by the virus. To overcome this, many viruses have evolved the ability to utilize the host protease machinery to direct cellular protein degradation for their survival and replication [11] . 26S proteasome is a large multi-subunit complex that selectively degrades intracellular proteins. It is involved in a wide variety of proteolytically mediated intracellular processes, such as cell cycle progression, apoptosis, metabolic regulation, and transcriptional control [12] . The majority of proteins that target the proteasome are tagged with polyubiquitin, which serves as a signal for their degradation. In the process of protein degradation, substrates are first tagged by ubiquitin by three enzymes, ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1 enzyme), ubiquitin-conjugation enzyme (E2 enzyme), and ubiquitin ligase (E3 ligase) [13] . The polyubiquitinated proteins are then rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Recent studies have implicated that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway might play key roles in virus infection and facilitates activities required for various aspects of the virus life cycle, from entry [14] through replication [15, 16] and enhanced cell survival [11] to viral release [17, 18] . In addition, proteasome inhibitors reduce the replication or progeny release of several viruses, including coxsackievirus B3 [19] , human cytomegalovirus [20] , human immunodeficiency virus type 1 [21] , and Sendai virus [22] .",

Therefore, in subsequent experiments, we treated infected cells with proteasome inhibitors for 6 h. To determine whether IBDV production was dose-dependently reduced by proteasome inhibitor treatment, DF-1 cells were infected with IBDV strain LM and then treated with various concentrations of proteasome-specific inhibitors. At 6 h after infection, the input proteasome inhibitors were removed and replaced by growth medium without these inhibitors. Supernatants were collected 21 h p.i., and the amount of progeny virus was determined by titration using TCID 50 assays on DF-1 cells (Fig. 1A) . IBDV replication in untreated cells resulted in the generation of a viral titer of 10 6.5 TCID 50 /0.1 ml after 21 h p.i., whereas proteasome inhibition reduced the titer of released virus in the supernatant in a dose-dependent manner.

DF-1 cells were infected with IBDV and MG132 (20 lM) was added and kept in the media for three different intervals, as shown in Fig. 3A . The cells were incubated until 18 h p.i., and the supernatants were collected for virus titration. Treatment for 0-6 h resulted in significant reduction of virus yield (3log-unit reduction compared to the titer of the no-treatment control). The virus titer of the group treated for 6-12 h was 1 log unit lower than the titer of the control sample. For virus accumulate from 12 to 18 h p.i., only a slight reduction of the virus titer was observed. The virus titers from the 0 to 6 h, 6 to 12 h, and 12 to 18 h treatment groups were compared to that of the no-treatment control, indicating that MG132 does not have significant effects on the late steps of the viral life cycle. The result suggests that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is most likely involved at an early step in the virus life cycle, since the inhibitory effect of MG132 was seen primarily in the 0-6 treatment group. As described above, the proteasome inhibitor has an inhibitory effect on IBDV infection at the early step. To further reveal the possible mechanism of inhibition by MG132, the virus internalization assay was performed. After 3-h pretreatment with MG132, the cells were incubated with IBDV at 4\u00b0C for 1 h to allow virus binding and then incubated at 39\u00b0C for an additional hour to allow virus internalization. Afterwards, the fresh medium without MG132 was added and the cells were further incubated at 39\u00b0C until 18 h p.i. The supernatants were collected for virus titration. There was no difference in virus titer in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 3B) .

As shown in Fig. 6 , IBDV induced the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm of infected cells. Level of cytochrome c thus rose in cytosol fractions of the infected cells (Fig. 6) , whereas they could only be sequestered in the mitochondria of the mock-infected cells (data not shown). However, the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol was dose-dependently decreased in the IBDV-infected cells when treated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 ( Fig. 6 and data not shown). Therefore, the results indicate that IBDV could trigger the efflux of cytochrome c in the mitochondria into the cytoplasm after infection, which activates series of caspases in turn induces apoptosis. Furthermore, this apoptotic activity induced by IBDV could be strongly reduced by proteasome inhibitor which is due to their inhibition to viral replication.",

            "text": "Recently, several viruses were found to require active proteasomes. Retroviruses require the proteasome for budding from cells [33] [34] [35] , the human cytomegalovirus for inducing cell cycle progression [36, 37] , the simian virus 5 and human parainfluenza virus type 2 for blocking IFN signaling [38, 39] , Epstein-Barr virus and herpes simplex virus 1 for regulating viral latency [40, 41] , minute virus of mice for nuclear translocation [42] , and murine coronavirus for its transfer from endosome to cytoplasm during viral entry [43] . Adenovirus requires active proteasomes to promote late gene expression [44] and coxsackievirus for viral RNA transcription and protein synthesis [19] . In the present study, we showed that the proteasome inhibitor decreased IBDV replication via suppression of viral RNA transcription (Fig. 4A ) and protein translation (Fig. 4B, C) , and further showed that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in an early step of IBDV replication but does not block virus internalization (Fig. 3A, B) . However, whether the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway-mediated IBDV replication is related to ubiquitination process and/or the proteasome degradation is not clear. We examined the proteasome activity following IBDV infection and to determine the effect of proteasome inhibitor on its activity. 26S proteasome activities were unchanged in IBDV-infected DF-1 cells, whereas proteasome inhibitor MG132 dramatically inhibited proteasome activity in both mock-and IBDV-infected cells (data not shown). In addition, we also observed a significant accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins after MG132 treatment by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Therefore, the ubiquitination process may play a role in the ubiquitinproteasome pathway-mediated IBDV replication or protein degradation. In a recent report, Liu and Vakharia [28] demonstrated that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 at 50 lM was completely able to inhibit NF-jB activity as well as IBDVinduced DNA laddering and caspase-3 activation, and thus suggested that MG132 prevents IBDV-induced apoptosis via strong inhibition of NF-jB activity required for IBDVinduced apoptosis. However, the IBDV RNA transcription and protein synthesis in the infected cells in the presence of MG132 was not available in the study [28] . In this study, IBDV RNA transcription and protein synthesis were significantly inhibited in the IBDV-infected cells after treatment with MG132 at 50 lM ( Fig. 4A-C) , and activations of caspase-9 and caspase-3 were dose-dependently reduced after treatment with various concentrations of MG132 (Fig. 5) . Therefore, we suggested that proteasome inhibitors decrease IBDV infectivity and the anti-apoptotic effect of the proteasome inhibitor may be due to reduced viral replication.",

In this study, we for the first time demonstrated that the cytochrome c was also located in the cytoplasm of IBDV-infected cells as assayed by Western-blotting (Fig. 6) . Furthermore, levels of cytochrome c in cytosol fractions were dose-dependently reduced after treatment with various concentrations of MG132 (Fig. 6) . Released cytochrome c activates caspase-9 in concert with the cytoplasmic factors dATP and Apaf-1, as a result, leading consequently to activation of caspase-3 [46] .
