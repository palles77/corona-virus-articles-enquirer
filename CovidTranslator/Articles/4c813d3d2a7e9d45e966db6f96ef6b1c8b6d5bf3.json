This article reports a study investigating hand and environmental contamination levels when health care workers (HCWs) followed two different methods of removing gloves at two distances from the rubbish bin. Methods: Fifty HCWs performed a personal or causal glove removal method (pretest) and a Centers for Disease Control (CDC)recommended glove removal method (posttest) at distances of 2 feet and 3 feet from the rubbish bin after the application of fluorescent solution (the simulated contaminant) onto their gloved hands. Results: The incidence of the small patch of fluorescent stain (,1 cm 2 ) on the front of the doffed gloves was significantly lower in the posttest than in the pretest. The incidence of small and large patches (.1 cm 2 ) on the front of the doffed gloves and on the cover of the rubbish bin was significantly lower at 3 feet than at 2 feet. Health care assistants had significantly higher levels of contamination than other HCWs in the pretest but not in the posttest. There was no significant difference in hand contamination rate between pretest and posttest based on distance from the rubbish bin and type of HCW. Conclusion: The impact of the glove removal procedure and the distance to the bin in which used gloves are discarded should be taken into consideration on a daily basis, along with the supervision of infection control measures by minor staff.",

            "text": "The consequences of bioterrorism and the threat of emerging infectious diseases, such as smallpox, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and a recent new type of influenza A (H1N1), have become a reality for frontline health care workers (HCWs). [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended for optimal protection from cross-infection among patients and other HCWs. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Gloves are not only necessary for contact precautions, but also essential for preventing the transmission of infectious bacteria, viruses, and microorganisms that can spread by direct or indirect contact with an infected person or contaminated environment. [7] [8] [9] Gloves also reduce the transmission risks posed by the presence of excessive wound drainage, fecal incontinence, or other bodily discharges. 10 Despite the recommendations, the risk of health care-associated infection through transmission of microorganisms from contaminated gloves to HCWs' hands remains, however. [11] [12] [13] Pittet et al 14 and Boyce 15 reported finding bacteria from patients on the hands of 30% of HCWs who had worn gloves for each patient contact. Pittet et al 14 found that HCWs who wore gloves during patient contact experienced hand contamination at an average rate of 3 colony-forming units (CFU) per minute of patient care. Bacteria and viruses can be passed to HCWs' hands through gloves or by contamination of hands during glove removal. 12, [16] [17] [18] [19] The possibility of contamination considerably increases the potential risk to HCW's hands, which can become infected by contact with a glove at the time of removal. In addition, because latex gloves are elastic and stretchable, certain areas of a working environment might be contaminated by the stretching motion during glove removal. 20 Thus, unpredictable contamination could stain the clinical environment. Most previous studies have identified hand contamination 9, 21 and the  permeable effect of gloves 22,23 as problematic; however, few studies have explored the possible environmental contamination caused by the stretching  motion during glove removal. Recent studies noted that some HCWs became infected with SARS despite wearing full PPE (gloves, gown, and N95 respirator). 2, 24, 25 This ''through precautions'' transmission might be caused by contamination during the removal of protective clothing. 26, 27 A study examining self-contamination rates in HCWs wearing two personal protective systems found that the anterior neck, forearms, wrists, and hands were the likeliest zones for contamination during removal of protective systems. 28 This points to the importance of properly removing PPE, including gloves, which may minimize self-contamination, contamination of the working environment, and possibly contamination of patients.",

However, to date no studies have examined the effects of the CDC-recommended method on the preventing contamination by comparing the contamination rates associated with the CDC's glove removal method and personal or causal glove removal methods (ie, those predominately used in daily practice). Given the vital need to prevent contamination from gloves, this study had 2 purposes. The study set out to examine the hand contamination rates and environmental contamination levels when (1) different methods of glove removal were followed, including personal or causal methods (pretest) and the CDC's recommended method (posttest), and (2) the distance to the bin varied between 2 feet and 3 feet (customary distances used by HCWs in Hong Kong), measured in the common gown down areas (ie, designated areas for HCWs to gown down their PPE) in the fever and cohort wards (wards for patients with epidemiological and clinical information suggestive of a similar diagnosis to share rooms, and with a spatial separation of at least 1 meter from one another) of a public hospital in Hong Kong. In the posttest, all of the subjects had to follow the CDC's glove removal steps. For the pretest, subjects could remove gloves however they wished, which differed considerably from the CDC method. We hypothesized that (1) different methods of glove removal have different effects on hand contamination rates and environmental contamination levels; (2) contamination levels differ between the 2 foot and 3 foot distances from the rubbish bin; and (3) following the CDC's glove removal method may significantly decrease contamination of HCWs and the environment.",

The environmental contamination would be greatly reduced by increasing the distance by about 1 foot when discarding used gloves. And (3) small patches are the more frequent form of contamination. Our findings support the validity of our first two hypotheses proposed earlier in the article. Our results also verify the third hypothesis as well. There were significantly fewer small patch of fluorescent stain on the front of the cloth and on HCA's gowns after the CDC glove removal demonstration. These observations show that the CDC glove removal method significantly decreased the rate of contamination of the environment and HCWs, indicating that the CDC recommendations can help eliminate contamination of the area between the HCW and the environment. These findings need to be shared with HCWs to emphasize the importance of evidence-based practice to their daily practice. Most HCWs have learned the CDC glove removal steps after the SARS outbreak of 2003, and many attend infection control lectures periodically to refresh their practice. Nonetheless, some of the subjects had forgotten the CDC glove removal steps before watching the video for this study. Our hospital has many posters reminding frontline HCWs about hand hygiene and the sequence for removing PPE, yet none of these HCWs followed the CDC glove removal procedure. As far as the results of this study are concerned, the CDC glove removal procedure is certainly essential to prevent cross-infection in daily practice. Thus, we recommend posting related information and continue reminding HCWs about infection control measures through lectures, talks, pamphlets, posters, and supervisory interactions.",

Our data fill this research gap and suggest many helpful implications for infection prevention and control. Our findings suggest that HCWs should avoid standing in front of a patient, other HCWs, or clean areas such as the nursing station while removing gloves. Such measures may be included in the usual infection control measures that facilitate the prevention of cross-infection and environmental contamination. Likewise, the placement of the rubbish bin is also an important point, given that most HCWs remove their gloves in front of the bin. We recommend not placing the rubbish bin under the sink used for hand hygiene. Standing in front of the sink while removing gloves could result in contamination of the edge of the sink. Contamination and recontamination on the front side of their working clothes also might occur when HCWs approach the sink for hand hygiene afterward. Thus, we recommend that the rubbish bin be placed at least 2 feet away from the sink. In this study, HCAs had a significantly higher level of contamination compared with RNs, Ens, and TUNSs in the pretest period. HCAs might lack systemic knowledge of nursing science, especially in the area of infection control because they were only trained for 1 month in such basic nursing procedures as measuring urine output, emptying urine bags, providing tube feedings, and changing napkins before they were employed. Their use of a personal or causal glove removal procedure in their daily practice might have led to higher rate of environmental contamination. This findings indicates that minor staff should pay more attention to infection control as an essential part of their daily practice, and that closer supervision should be provided. The HCAs did demonstrate decreased environmental contamination after viewing the CDC glove removal video and demonstration; therefore, there were no differences in ranking in the posttest period. This finding supports the importance of training and supervision for minor staff on proper glove removal.",
