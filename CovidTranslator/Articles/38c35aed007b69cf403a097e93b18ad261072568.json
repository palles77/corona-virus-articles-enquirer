Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load 28 data collected from the same specimen (throat / nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal / 29 sputum / tracheal aspirate), we compare within-host dynamics for patients infected in 30 the current outbreak with analogous dynamics for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV 31 infections. Our quantitative analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics 32 are more severe than those for mild cases of MERS-CoV, but are similar to severe 33 cases, and that the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV infection are similar to those of 34 MERS-CoV in mild cases but not in severe case. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 35 generates infection dynamics that are more severe than SARS-CoV. Furthermore, 36 we used our viral dynamics model to predict the effectiveness of unlicensed drugs 37 that have different methods of action. The effectiveness was measured by AUC of 38 viral load. Our results indicated that therapies that block de novo infections or virus 39 production are most likely to be effective if initiated before the peak viral load (which 40 occurs around three days after symptom onset on average), but therapies that 41 promote cytotoxicity are likely to have only limited effects. Our unique mathematical 42 approach provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, which 43 are useful for development of antiviral therapies. 44 Keywords: 45 SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, mathematical model, antiviral therapy 46 All rights reserved.

This demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 100 causes infection more effectively than in mild cases of MERS-CoV, but a general 101 SARS-CoV-2 infection follows infection dynamics that are similar to severe cases 102 due to MERS-CoV. In addition, as a median estimate, 65% inhibition of the initial 103 virus expansion is required to prevent the establishment of SARS-CoV-2 infection 104 (we provide a detailed analysis later).

For example, a 141 SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody has been reported to cross react 142 with SARS-CoV-2 (14). We conducted in silico experiments with varying drug 143 efficacy (considering inhibition rates from 10% to 100%, i.e. 0.1 \u2264 \u2264 1) and with the 144 timing of initiation of therapy from 0 days (i.e., post-exposure prophylactic use of 145 antivirals) until 5 days after symptom onset (i.e., 0 \u2264 * \u2264 5) (see Methods). Our 146 results show that early initiation of therapy (especially within two to three days) with 147 even a relatively weak drug (inhibition rates as low as 50%) might effectively reduce 148 the area under the curve of viral load (AUC) and prevent significant reductions in the 149 numbers of target cells because of cytopathic effects due to cell invasion. A therapy 150 of this type initiated four days after symptom onset, on the other hand, is not 151 predicted to induce a clear antiviral effect (Fig. 3AD) . This suggests that blocking de 152 novo infections is not likely to be effective unless the intervention is initiated before 153 the peak viral load. Hence, appropriate initiation timing (i.e., before or very soon after 154 symptom onset) is an important factor for suppressing viral load in addition to the 155 therapy having the potential for antiviral effects. 156",

Including a random effect amounts to a partial pooling of the data 323 between individuals to improve estimates of the parameters applicable across the 324 population of patients. By using this approach, the differences between viral 325 dynamics in different patients were not estimated explicitly, nor did we fully pool the 326 data which would bias estimates towards highly sampled patients. In this method of 327 estimation, each parameter estimate (= \u00d7 ) depends on the individual where 328 is fixed effect, and is random effect with an assumed Gaussian distribution with 329 mean 0 and standard deviation \u03a9. Population parameters and individual parameters 330 were estimated using the stochastic approximation expectation-maximisation 331 algorithm and empirical Bayes' method, respectively. Individual estimated 332 parameters and initial values for patients are summarized in Table S1 . Using parameters were compared and tested using the bootstrap t-test. Due to the small 340 sample size for viral loads in sputum/tracheal aspirate for MERS-CoV, we assumed 341 the fixed effect was the same for mild and severe MERS-CoV cases. Otherwise, the 342 process was exactly the same as that described for the throat swab data. 343",
