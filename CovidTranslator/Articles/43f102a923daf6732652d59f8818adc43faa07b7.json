A method of hybridizing RNAs on the surface of the streptavidin-coated (SA) sensor chip to study RNA-protein interactions was described in this paper. In our study, it has been shown that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has a high binding affinity for the leader sequence of SARS-CoV genome. Effect of temperature on the RNA-DNA hybridization was also examined. This method can provide the affinity of interactions with high sensitivity. Therefore, it will be useful in screening binding candidates for a given RNA target motif with one chip.",

SPR is an optical detection technology to measure the changes in the refractive index near a sensor surface that offers kinetic analysis of biomolecular interactions in real time [4] [5] [6] [7] . Molecular binding is monitored by a change in SPR angle, which is reported as resonance units (RU). One RU corresponds approximately to a surface concentration of 1 pg/ mm 2 for an average protein. However, it should be emphasized that the relationship between RU and pg of the materials varies with the refractive index of the bound molecule, and, thus, nucleic acid is different from protein [6, 7] . If the molecule does not bind to a target on the chip surface, it will give zero RU of response. A limitation of the method is that the sensor surface is not well-suitable to the small molecules analysis (\\200 Da). Also, the mass transfer problem should be reduced by optimizing the flow rate and the amount of bound molecules.",

The SA sensor chip carries a dextran matrix of immobilized streptavidin which is used for capturing the biotinylated ligand, especially biotinylated nucleic acid. In our method, biotinylated DNA instead of biotinylated RNA was used to fix on the chip, as DNA is more stable than RNA. The 106-nt ss-RNA containing a sequence domain complementary to the captured DNA probe was immobilized on the sensor chip. An increase in RU indicated the hybridization between RNA and fixed DNA when a transcribed RNA was injected as shown in Fig. 2a- ii. Under the same experimental condition, a non-complementary RNA probe was injected and no hybridization was detected as expected (data not shown). This data indicated that the RNA hybridization was specific. Non-covalently captured ligands usually dissociate partially during the analysis cycle. Therefore, the average dissociation rate of the RNA immobilized on DNA 7.71 9 10 -5 s -1 at 37\u00b0C was obtained, which resulted in a loss of less than 5% of the RNA within 5 minutes. The interaction between the RNA and the pre-immobilized biotinylated DNA has a high affinity.

The consistency of RNA-protein binding capacity should be tested before proceeding to next stages to ensure whether the RNA is useful. After the RNA hybridization, the chemically synthesized DNA CR complementary to part of the RNA was injected, giving rise to a 170 RU increase (Fig. 2a-iv) . Because DNA CR was 30 nt and the transcribed RNA was 106 nt in length, the additional 170 RU suggested that the captured RNA should be 170 9 106/ 30 = 601 RU (a 1:1 binding analyte binding stoichiometry). Comparing with the captured RNA RU 630 (Fig. 2a iii) before the injection of DNA CR, the RNA was about 95% active. When a non-complementary DNA oligo dT was injected, no significant change in response units was detected on the sensorgram (Fig. 2a-v) . The result indicated that about 95% of the RNA had a real binding activity; therefore, the responses detected were that as expected.",

The buffer conditions used for RNA hybridization were also suitable for RNA-protein binding as determined in previous studies [10, 17] . Three different temperatures 25, 30 and 37\u00b0C were evaluated in the RNA-DNA hybridization. The same RNA sample was injected for 200 s, and the system was washed with running buffer. Temperature increase clearly enhanced the RNA-DNA hybridization (Fig. 2b) . When the temperature was kept below 25\u00b0C, the hybridized RNA was hardly detectable. DNA CB complementary to the pre-immobilized DNA was also injected at three different temperatures (Fig. 1b) . The hybridization of DNA CB at 25\u00b0C could reach about 50% of the level achieved at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 2c) . This observation could be explained by the fact that longer single-stranded oligonucleotides can easily generate hairpins at lower temperature. Therefore, incubations at higher temperature may help to unfold the secondary construct especially in RNA molecules.",

At the same time, the position of the RNA-protein complex also moved to that of high molecular weight complexes (Fig. 3a) . No significant difference could be detected by gel electrophoresis when the binding was performed at different temperatures of incubations. When ssDNA and dsDNA were incubated with N protein, the binding activity could not be observed even after one hour incubation (data not shown). This data indicated that N protein specifically bound to RNA. SPR detection relies on the affinity of the interaction between a molecule and the ligand attached to the sensor surface [4] [5] [6] [7] 18] . N protein was loaded onto the RNAhybridized sensor chip to measure the binding affinities of RNA-protein interaction. To examine the binding specificity, BSA protein was used as a negative control, and was injected at the same concentrations used for N protein (Fig. 4-iii) . Binding between BSA and RNA was not detected whereas N protein gave a capture of 170 RU Fig. 4-iv) , indicating that the detection of the binding between N protein and RNA was specific. The binding affinity between N protein and the target RNA at 37\u00b0C has an average Kd 4.60 \u00b1 0.3 nM (Fig. 3b) .

We have shown that the binding temperature was essential to optimize RNA hybridizations (Fig. 2b) . The data indicated that binding conditions were appropriate for RNA-DNA hybridizations and the binding was specific. In practice, the maximum response observed (the effective binding capacity) was affected by the activity of the ligand. Theoretically, the capture of 600 RU of 106-nt RNA only needs 600 9 33/106 = 187 RU of biotinylated DNA because biotinylated DNA was 33 nt in length. However, when we immobilized 200 RU of biotinylated DNA, the activity of captured RNAs was very low and was quickly [17] . We calculated that the average binding affinity between SARS-CoV N protein and the target RNA was 4.60 nM at 37\u00b0C .These differences may be a reflection of the intrinsic property of different coronavirus N proteins and RNAs or of the different kinetic measurement and condition used. The binding sensorgrams at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 3b . Some degree of difference in the bound protein amount observed by increasing the temperature showed that this approach is more sensitive than the EMSA.",

Since the maximum attainable binding capacity to capture a ligand is always lower than that of a direct immobilized ligand and the RNA should be captured at the beginning of each analysis cycle, we suggest to immobilize the maximum amount of biotinylated DNA probes. The total captured RNA can be controlled by changing the volume of the injection. Considering that RNAs are easily degraded in common conditions, we have selected a higher temperature in order to ensure a rapid RNA hybridization. Although occasional background noise signals might be increased when the temperature is higher than 30\u00b0C, this noise can be minimized by improving the injection technique and by using highly purified analytes.Nelson  et al. obtained a Kd of 14 nM of the binding affinity for MHV N protein with RNA [13] and Chen et al. determined that the binding affinity for IBV N protein to the IBV leader was 2.82 nM",
