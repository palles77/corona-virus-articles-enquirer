            "text": "Gap constraint SPM (or gap constraint sequence pattern mining) can avoid finding many useless patterns by setting gap constraints, while repetitive SPM 25 cannot [20, 21] since it does not set gap constraint. Gap constraint SPM is also different from frequent substring mining [22] and n-gram text mining [23] , since the latters mine the pattern without gaps. One key issue of gap constraint SPM is to calculate the support (the number of occurrences) of a pattern in a sequence, which is pattern matching problem [24, 25, 26] . Thus, gap constraint 30 is also called a wildcard gap or flexible wildcards [27, 28] in pattern matching fields. If a pattern has many gaps that are the same, the pattern is called a pattern with periodic gaps [29] , described as P =p 1 [a, b]p 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 p m\u22121 [a, b]p m , where a and b (0\u2264a\u2264b) are the minimum and maximum gap constraints, respectively, and m indicates the pattern length [30] . The size of gap constraints can be flexi- 35 bly set by users, which leads to various applications, such as correlation analysis between DNA and diseases based on gap constraints [29] . Li et al. [31] proposed an effective method to mine the patterns with gap constraints that can be used for feature extraction for sequence classifications [32] . However, introducing gap constraints not only makes the mining method more flexible but also makes the 40 results more complex because the number of patterns increases exponentially as the pattern length increases. To solve this problem, the nonoverlapping condition [33] was proposed, which allows the same sequence letter to match and rematch pattern letters at different positions. Introducing the nonoverlapping condition not only reduces the number of occurrences but also makes the unique Example 1. Given a sequence database SDB ={S 1 =AATCATCA, S 2 =AATGACTACTCAA, 50 S 3 =ATCAGATCAG}. Pattern P =A[0,2]T[0,2]C[0,2]A is a periodic gapped pattern. To make it easier to describe, an occurrence will be described in the form of a sequence landmark. For example, the first occurrence of P in S 1 is s 1 s 3 s 4 s 5 , which can be written as <1,3,4,5>. In this way, the other 2 occurrences of P in Similarly, there are four occurrences of P in both S 2 and S 3 . If we ignore the repetition, the support of P 1 in SDB is 3. If we take the repetition into consideration, the support is 3+4+4=11. The latter method considers occurrences in detail. However, this method also encounters some problems. For example, there are three occurrences for pattern Q= A[0, 2]T in sequence S 4 = 60 AAATCCC, but there are nine occurrences for its super-pattern Q = A[0, 2]T[0, 2]C. This example shows that the number of patterns increases exponentially with increasing pattern length, which does not satisfy the Apriori property [19] .",

            "text": "Agrawal et al. [36] proposed SPM. Based on this research, many achievements have been made, such as high utility mining [37] , contrast SPM [38, 39] , and closed SPM [40, 41] . Closed SPM can effectively compress the frequent patterns [42, 43] . For example, assuming that the supports of patterns \"A\", 110 \"AT\", and \"ATC\" are equal, then patterns \"A\" and \"AT\" are called redundant patterns. Hence, patterns \"A\", \"AT\", \"ATC\" can be compressed into \"ATC\" without losing support information. Besides closed pattern mining, there are other methods to achieve pattern compression, such as generator mining [44] and maximal pattern mining [45] . Generator mining aims to find the set of 115 patterns with minimal length, while closed pattern mining focuses on finding the set of patterns with maximal length. Maximal pattern mining finds the set of patterns whose super-patterns are infrequent. Closed SPM has become a research hotspot because of its impressive compression performance [46, 47] and has been widely used in many essential fields, such as recommendation systems 120 [48], clustering analysis [49, 50, 51] , genetic engineering [52] , disease diagnosis [53] , and software engineering [54, 55] . However, these studies ignored the repetitions that may contain more relevant information in long sequences. Noticing this disadvantage, Ding et al. [33] proposed the CloGSgrow algorithm, which studied the repetitive occurrences of patterns. CloGSgrow calculates the occur- Another important branch of SPM is gap constraint SPM. This method aims to discover subsequences from sequences that satisfy the gap constraints and support threshold. Existing studies are based on three types of conditions, no-condition [29, 56] , one-off condition [8, 57] , and nonoverlapping condition [33, 34, 58] . The no-condition allows sequence letters to be reused by patterns 135 for an unlimited time. Zhang et al. [29] first proposed SPM under no-condition in DNA sequences. However, pattern mining under no-condition does not satisfy the Apriori property, which means it is necessary to expand the search space to mine all frequent patterns [19] . The one-off condition allows the sequence letters to be matched no more than once [59] . In Example 1, there is only one 140 occurrence <1,3,4,5> with the one-off condition. Pattern mining under the oneoff condition was applied to biological sequence mining [8] , which is an NP-Hard problem, since its computational complexity is the same as that of an iterative shuffle problem [60] . Therefore, heuristic strategies are applied to calculate the pattern support. Hence, pattern mining under the one-off condition belongs to 145 approximate mining. The nonoverlapping condition allows the sequence letters to be rematched by the different pattern letters and to be matched no more than once by the same pattern letter. Although the nonoverlapping condition is more complex than the other two, our previous studies have demonstrated that the pattern mining under thee nonoverlapping condition is not only a complete 150 mining method with the Apriori property but can also discover more valuable patterns than the other two conditions [34, 35] . Consequently, pattern mining under the nonoverlapping condition outperforms those of the no-condition and one-off condition. A comparison of the related research work is shown in Table   1 . As can be seen from Table 1 , Reference [34] is the closest to this paper. The differences between Reference [34] and this paper are as follows. To obtain the maximum pattern support, NETGAP prunes the invalid nodes after obtaining a nonoverlapping occurrence [34] . Hence, the time complexity of NETGAP is",

            "text": "Given a sequence and a pattern with gap constraints, all occurrences can be 215 represented by a Nettree [65] which is an extended tree structure with multiple roots and parents. Since the nodes with the same label can appear on a Nettree for multiple times, n i j is used to represent node i in the j-th level. A path from a root to a leaf in the Nettree corresponds to an occurrence of the pattern in the sequence. The problem of calculating the support of pattern P in sequence S with 220 the nonoverlapping condition means that all Nettree nodes cannot be reused in the same level [34] . The above properties make Nettree the most suitable for representing the nonoverlapping occurrences of a pattern. In our previous work [34] , NETGAP was proposed employing Nettree, which is a complete method to calculate the nonoverlapping occurrence. However, the weakness of NETGAP 225 is the lower efficiency since NETGAP must prune the invalid nodes after obtaining a nonoverlapping occurrence. Based on the above reasons, we propose the BackTr algorithm, which is of superior efficiency. Examples 5 and 6 will illustrate the principles of NETGAP and BackTr, respectively. a Nettree can be created as shown in Fig. 2 . The first step of NETGAP is to prune the invalid nodes which are n 5 2 , n 12 1 , and n 14 1 . Then NETGAP selects the first root node and finds a root-leaf path employing the leftmost child strategy. In Fig. 2 , it is easy to obtain the first root-leaf path <n 1 1 , n 2 2 , n 4 3 , n 7 4 >, marked in yellow. The corresponding occurrence is <1,2,4,7>. Then, NETGAP 235 deletes nodes n 1 1 , n 2 2 , n 4 3 , and n 7 4 . After that, NETGAP finds the invalid nodes in the new Nettree. It is clear that there are no invalid nodes at that time.",

The experiments verify that NetNCSP employs the inheriting, predicting, and determining strategies, which improve the mining efficiency significantly. Hence, NetNCSP outperforms NetNCSP-noinh and NetNCSP-nocheck.455 2. The BackTr strategy is significantly effective. According to Figs. 3-5, Net-NCSP and NetNCSP-netgap have the same closeness determination times and support calculation times, but the running time of NetNCSP is less than that of NetNCSP-netgap. For example, in Fig. 3, the running time of NetNCSP and NetNCSP-netgap are 679.0 and 1140.3 s in Ebola virus, The reason is that NetNCSP employs the BackTr strategy, and reduces the running time by pruning invalid nodes, thus reducing the time complexity from O(m\u00d7m\u00d7n\u00d7W ) to O(m\u00d7n\u00d7W",

            "text": "The results are shown in Figs.6-8.    To compare the mining capability of algorithms in different databases, six sequences are included to mine closed patterns with length 5, which are DNA1,485 DNA3, DNA6, AX829174, Potato virus, and Ebola virus. The parameters are len=[1,1000], gap=[0,100], and minsup=1200. The results are shown in Figs. Pattern number with different pattern length Running time and ATC with different pattern length 1. NetNCSP outperforms NOSEP since NetNCSP not only compresses the pat-490 terns effectively but also achieves higher efficiency. For example, in Fig. 6, when the pattern length is 7, NOSEP gets 1864 patterns, while NetNCSP gets 1188. The running time of NOSEP and NetNCSP are 431.1 and 351.8 s, respectively. Similar phenomena can be discovered in different databases. For example, in Fig. 10, the running time of NOSEP and NetNCSP are 495 263.8 and 189.6 s in AX829174, respectively. The reasons are as follows. Firstly, NetNCSP adopts a more efficient backtracking strategy in calculating pattern support, and reduces the time complexity from O(m\u00d7m\u00d7n\u00d7W ) to O(m\u00d7n\u00d7W ). More importantly, NetNCSP adopts three effective pruning strategies. The predicting and inheriting strategies prune the redundant 500 unclosed patterns before calculating support of candidate patterns, Support calculation times with different pattern length Pattern number with different databases determining strategy determines the closeness of frequent patterns avoiding the generation of candidate pattern of longer length. Hence, NetNCSP outperforms NOSEP. 2. NetNCSP outperforms CloGSgrow since NetNCSP mines more closed pat-505 terns and is more efficient in terms of ATC (Average mining Time per Closed pattern). For example, in Fig. 6, when the pattern length is 5, NetNCSP mines 282 closed patterns and CloGSgrow only gets 15. Although Fig. 7 shows that when the pattern length is 5, the running time of NetNCSP and CloGSgrow are 64.1 and 5.6 s respectively, the ATCs of NetNCSP and CloGS-510 grow are 64.1/282=0.2 and 5.6/15=0.4 s, respectively. Similar phenomena can be discovered in different databases. For example, in Figs. 9 and 10, CloGSgrow takes 83.3s to get 33 closed patterns in Ebola virus, Running time and ATC with different databases Support calculation times with different databases",

First, NetNCSP, as a complete algorithm, mines the complete closed patterns. Thus, more closed patterns can be discovered. Second, NetNCSP adopts three pruning strategies to reduce the running time effectively. As a result, NetNCSP outperforms CloGSgrow. 3. NetNCSP can compress the patterns effectively. For example, in Fig. 6, NOSEP and NetNCSP find 399 frequent patterns and 282 closed patterns with length 5, respectively. Thus, the compression rate is (399-282)/399= 29.3%. In Fig. 9, NOSEP and NetNCSP mine 1364 frequent patterns and 912 closed patterns in Ebola virus, respectively. Thus, the compression rate is 33.1%. The reason is that NOSEP mines the complete set of the frequent 25 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f patterns which contains redundant patterns, while NetNCSP mines a subset of the closed patterns according to three closeness determination pruning strategies.4. NetNCSP reduces the support calculation times effectively. For example,Fig. 8shows that when mining patterns with length 7, NetNCSP calculates the support for 1443 times, while NOSEP needs 2134 times. Similar phenomena can be found in different databases. For example,Fig. 11shows that Net-NCSP calculates support for 932 times in Ebola virus, while NOSEP needs 1364 times. The reason is that NetNCSP adopts the predicting and inheriting strategies to prune the redundant patterns, thus, reducing the support calculation times. As a result, NetNCSP reduces support calculation times.",
