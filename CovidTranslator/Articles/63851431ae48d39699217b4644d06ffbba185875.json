The high mutation rates of viruses, coupled with short generation times and large population sizes, allow viruses to rapidly evolve and adapt to the host environment. This has important implications for the pathogenesis of viral infections. In the course of the chapter, we will address a number of questions about virus evolution: (1) How are mutation rates defined and what are substitution rates? (2) Why are mutation rates so high? How do they differ for RNA and DNA viruses? (3) How are these rates measured and what are the shortcomings of standard measures? (4) Why is multiplicity of infection so relevant to the accumulation of mutations? (5) What are phylodynamics? What is a molecular clock and how is it estimated? (6) What drives virus evolution? What role does the host response play in virus evolution? How does this impact pathogenesis? Do viruses evolve to a benign relationship with their hosts? This chapter sets forth the basic tenets that govern the evolution of viruses: mutation rates, population size, selection, and the MOI. We will explore how viruses evolve within a host, during transmission to novel susceptible hosts, and establish infections in new host species.",

            "text": "Virus evolution is further characterized by additional layers of complexity. One unique characteristic of viruses is their MOI, which is the ratio between the number of viruses and the infecting cells. MOI has several consequences for evolution that are discussed in a later section, and these are subject to the constantly changing size of the virus population. The typical view of viral evolution is that viruses create huge population sizes within the infected host. However, this huge population size is punctuated by frequent bottlenecks during host-to-host transmission, and population structure within an infected host, where different organs and tissues may support different independently replicating populations. These differences in population size will affect both the selection-drift balance mentioned above, and the MOI of different virus subpopulations. In the rest of this chapter, we discuss the different factors affecting the virus population, and how these factors intertwine to shape virus evolution. Mutation rate is typically defined as the average number of errors created in genomes of viral progeny, per base, per replication cycle (mut/nuc/rep). Viruses possess mutation rates that are orders of magnitude higher than any other replicating entity (Table 1) . These rates range from approximately 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mut/nuc/rep in the RNA bacteriophage Q\u03b2 (Batschelet et al., 1976) to \u223c10 \u22128 mut/nuc/ rep in the DNA virus Herpes simplex (Drake and Hwang, 2005) . These examples highlight the interesting difference between RNA viruses, which replicate with their own RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), and DNA viruses which replicate with either their own or the cellular DNA-dependent DNA polymerase. RdRps all lack the proofreading capabilities present in DNA polymerases, and thus RNA viruses have much higher mutation rates than DNA viruses. Strikingly, it has been found that both increasing and decreasing the mutation rate of a virus leads to reduced virulence of the virus population (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005; Vignuzzi et al., 2006) . This suggests there is a close link between the mutation rate of a virus, the diversity created in a virus population, and pathogenesis in an infected host.",

            "text": "While mutations create raw genetic diversity, it is the coupled action of mutation and selection that will determine which mutations will persist in the viral population. The rate at which mutations fix in a population is termed the substitution rate, or evolutionary rate, which is measured by comparing the genomes of different isolates of a virus collected at several different time points (Duffy et al., 2008) . Once again, RNA viruses possess much higher substitution rates than DNA viruses, ranging from 0.01 substitutions per site per year (sub/site/yr) in the RNA poliovirus type 1 to 7 \u00d7 10 \u22127 in the DNA virus monkeypox. As suggested by theory, in most viruses substitution rates correlate well with mutation rates (Table 1 ). This suggests that the short-term mutation rate is an important determinant of the rate of long-term molecular evolution. However, for the fastest mutators (mostly RNA viruses), there appears to be an upper limit to the rate of evolution. This is due to the exceptionally high load of deleterious variant viruses in these small RNA viruses, which slows down their rate of molecular evolution. This high load dictates a threshold beyond which populations may go extinct. Indeed, it has been shown that by artificially increasing the mutation rate of different RNA viruses, the population will collapse through a process termed lethal mutagenesis. This finding has led to the development of therapeutic drugs that induce lethal mutagenesis, which are used to treat a variety of viral infections such as Hepatitis C and West Nile virus (Beaucourt and Vignuzzi, 2014 ).",

Mutation rates refer to the rate of mutation per site per genome replication, or to the rate of mutation per site per round of viral replication (Duffy et al., 2008; Sanjuan et al., 2010) . Critically, these two measures can differ when viruses use stamping machine replication versus geometric genome replication ( Figure 1 ). During stamping machine replication one single virus genome is used as the template for replication, leading to linear accumulation of mutations. With geometric genome replication, progeny strands can become templates for replication themselves, and thus there is an exponential (or geometric) increase in progeny genomes. This will lead to a completely different distribution of mutations in the progeny genomes. Classically, the mutation rate of an organism is determined in one of the two ways: the Lurie-Delbruck fluctuation test or measurement of mutation accumulation. We describe both methods, their caveats, and present a novel sequencing technique, which has the potential to alleviate some of these problems.",

Next, a selective environment is used to measure a given phenotype caused by a single mutation (e.g., resistance to phage).

Since mutations arose spontaneously in the parallel clonal populations, it is possible to use the mutant frequency to backtrack the mutation rate. If the number of rounds of replication can be estimated and the number of initial input genomes is known, it is possible to obtain a mutation rate per site per round of replication. There are several caveats in this assay leading to a biased estimation of the mutation rate: Mutations at multiple sites may alter the mutant phenotype; or the number of rounds of replication may be incorrectly estimated when the mode (stamping machine versus geometric) of genome replication is unknown.",

(2014) could accurately record the frequency of lethal mutations, which are expected to be present in a population at a frequency equal to the basic unbiased mutation rate ( Figure 2 ). Applying this method to Poliovirus 1 populations confirmed a mean mutation rate of 3.97 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , consistent with previous measurements. However, these results yield a level of detail previously less appreciated: different pairs of bases are replaced at different rates. A further intriguing study has shown that measurements of viral mutation rates vary substantially when measured across different cell types.

In stamping machine replication, a single virus genome is used as the template for replication, leading to linear accumulation of mutations. With geometric genome replication, progeny strands can become templates for replication themselves, and thus there is an exponential increase in the number of mutations in the genomes of newly synthesized virions. Frequent recombination may lead to more efficient selection, allowing the efficient removal of deleterious alleles and the incorporation of adaptive alleles. High rates of recombination/reassortment may also lead to the emergence of strains with a more virulent phenotype, as is thought to occur in cross-species transmission events of influenza virus. However, high MOI may also have contrary effects, whereby inferior genotypes are rescued, and maintained in the population, by products of superior genotypes. Complementation at high MOI also leads to propagation of defective particles. Thus under high MOI conditions, the beneficial effect of adaptive alleles may be masked (Stern et al., 2014) .",

Such studies represent a collaboration between epidemiology and evolutionary biology, and the term phylodynamics has been coined to describe them. Phylodynamic methods are rooted in the powerful methodologies of phylogenetics, which emphasize the phylogenetic tree as key to investigating evolutionary processes. The ever-increasing availability of viral sequences has fueled this field and has made it possible to address a range of questions such as: \"when did a virus emerge?,\" \"what is the progenitor strain of a circulating epidemic?,\" and \"what is the timing of the spread of a virus across countries and continents?\" The phylodynamic approach has yielded remarkable insights into viral evolution.",

This will be true when most nucleotide substitutions are neutral, and are driven directly by the mutation rate. Phylogeny provides a practical method to calibrate the molecular clock. When a viral phylogeny is reconstructed, it furnishes the distance between an ancestral sequence and an extant sequence in units of nucleotide substitutions. When the nucleotide difference (from the ancestral sequence) of each extant sequence is plotted against time, it is possible to infer the rate of nucleotide substitution and thus track back the date at which the ancestral sequence emerged. As an example, Kew et al. (1995) collected a set of isolates of poliovirus from a 10-year sequential infection chain in South America, and used this to determine the number of mutations per year (9 \u00d7 10 \u22123 nucleotide substitutions per site per year for a 150 nucleotide window within the \u223c7500 nucleotide genome) (Figure 3 ). Most of these changes were synonymous mutations that would have little, if any, influence on the biological properties of the virus.",

Two notable examples are escape from the host immune response and from antiviral drugs. Immune escape mutants. A large armamentarium of effective viral vaccines have been developed over the last 75 years (see Chapter 19, Viral vaccines). These vaccines are based on \"ancient\" isolates (often at least 50 years old) of viruses which induce homologous neutralizing antibodies. Since these vaccines continue to provide protection against currently circulating viral strains, it must be concluded that the cognate viruses cannot evolve antibody-escape mutants that are sufficiently \"fit\" to survive and replace the original circulating strains. There are two notable exceptions to this general rule, influenza and HIV viruses. In both instances, antibody-escape mutants can survive to circulate in the population. For this reason, influenza virus continues to \"drift\" and new virus isolates must be used each year to produce protective vaccines. HIV has resisted the development of an effective vaccine mainly due to the difficulty of inducing \"broadly neutralizing\" antibodies that are effective against the population of escape mutants that have evolved over the last 30 years. In both instances, there is a structural explanation. Neutralizing antibodies to HIV and influenza viruses are not necessarily directed at the receptor-attachment site on the viral envelope, so neutralization escape mutants can still attach to cellular receptors, replicate, and persist ( Figure 5) . Antiviral drugs. A vast experience with antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV has shown that the virus swarm contains about 10 \u22125 variants that will resist any single drug. Many such mutants will be produced each day in an HIV-infected patient (see Chapter 20, Antiviral therapy and Chapter 15, Mathematical modeling). For this reason, it has been found that effective control of HIV infections in humans usually requires the simultaneous use of at least three drugs, each of which requires a different set of mutations to escape drug control. The frequency of three escape mutations in a single genome is so low (\u223c10 \u221215 ) that the drug combination will suppress HIV replication.",
