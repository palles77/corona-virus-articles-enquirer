            "text": "With the development of society and the progress of technology, the competition among cities and regions grows more and more fierce. In this process, resources can play an important role. Thus, against the globalization background, a city needs to size up the situation from the angle of globalization, utilize new resources; meanwhile, it also needs to develop and create local resource for improving competitiveness [1] .As illustrated in the definition from the report 'Our Common Future' [2] : \"Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generation to meet their own needs\". Krized and Power [3] argue that sustainable development was a global vision although it had been taken up by planners in the U.S. and other developed countries. According to Hopwood[4] , the concept of sustainable development is seen to be the result of the growing awareness of the global links between mounting environmental problems, socioeconomic issues dealing with poverty and inequality, and concerns about a healthy future for humanity. It does not mean having less economic development, on the contrary, a healthy economy better able to generate the resources to meet people's needs, and new investment and environmental improvement often go hand in hand [5] . In the view of Couch and Dennemann [6] , while economic development may be a legitimate policy goal, to be sustainable it must be achieved within the context of reducing the ecological footprint. The central value of sustainable development can be boiled down to a balance among the three 'E's: environment, economy, and equity [7] . As illustrated in Godschalk [8] , sustainable development seeks to reconcile the conflicts among economic development, ecological preservation, and intergenerational equity; three conflicts exist among sustainable development value. The 'property conflict' between economic growth and equitable sharing of opportunities arises from competing claims on uses of property as both a private resource and a public good; the 'resource conflict' between economic and ecological utility arises from competing claims on the consumption of natural resources and the preservation of their ability to reproduce; the 'development conflict' between social equity and environmental preservation arises from competing needs to improve a lot of poor people through economic growth while protecting the environment through growth management. (See Fig.1 It is clear that resources are a strategic factor in the process of sustainable development and the resource conflict exists between ecology and economy. Some resources, such as mineral products and oil, are non-renewable; they will be used up one day, so it is necessary to find new resources to replace them. By contrast, tourism resources, including natural landscape as well as historical and cultural resources, are renewable and can be redeveloped and utilized if they are well managed, maintained, and developed. As a tertiary industry, the sustainable development of the tourism industry is thought to be of paramount importance for urban development; its development relies mainly upon the sustainable utilization of tourism resources.",

            "text": "There are more than 600 cities in China; their culture resources are not only produced by historical accumulation of their own but also affected by their location factors. As a complex of signs and signification, 'culture' meshes into codes of transmission of social values and meanings that have a 'material effect' on urban growth and decline [11] . Generally speaking, the propagation of culture among regions mainly depends on their communication with each other. Fig.2 illustrates the production mechanism of the 'exotic culture' resource. According to the situation of China, regional relationships can be classified into two types: border-type and approach-type. The cities that have the border-type regional advantage are border cities, such as Dandong city, Ji'an city, Yanji city, and Tumen city; they not only have their local cultures but also fuse exotic cultures. The cities that have the approach-type regional advantage are mostly coastal cities such as Dalian, Qingdao, and Weihai. These cities have built trade relationships with Korea and Japan; companies and factories from those countries locate in these cities, which improves economic development and culture exchanges. However, this kind of 'exotic culture' resource provided by trade connections is easily ignored, although it is actually important. From Fig. 2 , it is clear that the exotic culture resource is produced through communication (trade, tourism, culture, business, etc.) between the objective city and foreign cities, but the resource is usually undeveloped. Thus, with the local culture often well utilized in tourism, the exotic culture resource should also be developed so as to make local and exotic cultures combined organically and fulfill the sustainable development of tourism resources.",

In 1998, it received an award as one of the best tourist cities in China. Weihai has such excellent tourism resources that a large number of domestic and foreign tourists visit there each year, which not only promotes tourism development but also promotes the development of correlated industries. The detailed situation of international tourists is shown in Table1. In 2009, the number of Korean tourists visiting Weihai was 255,042, accounting for the biggest proportion of all international tourists, increasing 12.85% from 2008. Japan was second in the number of tourists visiting Weihai in 2009 with 28,775, and Russia was third with 13,009. Obviously, Korean tourists are the main group of international tourists. Because Weihai is near Korea, many Korean enterprises locate in Weihai in order to develop Chinese markets; meanwhile, there are increasing numbers of Korean tourists who would like to travel to Weihai, which is famous as a summer resort. Visits by Korean tourists will not only promote the tourism development, but also improve the cultural communication between China and Korea. This communication produces Weihai's 'exotic culture' resource-Chinese and Korean culture. So it is necessary for the government to make full use of both its regional advantages and the opportunities of trade development between the two countries so as to develop new tourism resources for sustainable development.

A full 150 questionnaires were sent and 134 were returned and completed. The survey results are shown in Fig. 4 . Obviously, domestic tourists were very satisfied with the environmental level of Weihai. In comparison, they were very dissatisfied with goods; they thought that the convenience and service were just OK; and they were dissatisfied with transportation and facilities. In addition, the respondents thought that Weihai lacked characteristics that set it apart from other coastal cities. Korean Commercial Building. It found that the layout of the building's interior was confusing, and the stores seemed to be monotonous; meanwhile, the fire control facilities were not adequate to create a safe shopping environment. In addition, not all the items had price tags, and the price of some products was ten times higher than their value. It was also hard to distinguish between truth and false product claims, which resulted in the information asymmetry between sellers and buyers; the prestige of the commercial building was negatively affected as a result. From the in-depth survey, the study found the following problems for Weihai's tourism industry. First, Weihai's tourism started relatively late, and the supporting facilities are not sufficient, so its attraction to tourists is limited. Second, Weihai, like other coastal cities, only focuses on the 'sea' as a tourist resource in the process of making a development strategy; the seashore will perhaps attract some tourists but it lacks a characteristic of its own. Third, although there are many tourist spots in Weihai, they are scattered, and the inconvenient transportation system causes inconvenience to visitors. Fourth, the integration and management of tourism are not adequate; as a result, there are few tourism products that have been developed to an adequate scale. Finally, environmental protection in some areas has been ignored, and rich ecological resources are being destroyed in developing tourism resources.",

The detailed elements of Korean culture in Weihai are shown in Fig. 5 . The existence of Korean culture is a valuable resource for Weihai's tourism. On one hand, Korean culture elements of Weihai are formed naturally with trade, business, and education communication between Weihai and Korea; thus, urban managers only need to recognize their development potential and manage and utilize them effectively.

First of all, Korean tourism lays great stress on providing quality service and respecting tourists, which can surely brighten tourists' mood. Next, some scenic spots are built up as unique national features for attracting tourists to study their history and culture. In addition, the urban and natural environment of Korea is good enough to make tourists feel relaxed and happy. Meanwhile, the Korean government has paid more attention to building the city image (CI), and almost all cities have their own brand and slogan. Finally, Korea provides the disabled with convenient facilities and services. It is clear that the tourism management model seems to be more important than the tourism resource itself. So Weihai should also take into account improving service for tourists and optimizing the tourism management model.",

Additionally, a new 'Korean culture experience' region should be planned and built near to Korean Town; all the elements of Korean culture will be concentrated there, so that a real Korean culture town that concentrates living, dining, leisure, amusement, and shopping together can be available. In order to mange this town effectively, it is necessary for the government to offer a training program to shop owners of Korean culture town, instructing them on real Korean culture and improving their service level so that the tourists who come there will feel the exotic culture too; this is called 'implantation of cultural core'. On the basis of this scheme, combining Korean culture resources and local tourism resources (nature, environment, history, culture, etc.) will be an important consideration for urban managers because it will maximize the value and utilization of tourism resources.",

According to the survey, it was found that many tourists were interested in Korean culture, and they thought that Korea was worth visiting, yet their dream could not come true because of limited time and money. Clearly, the market for Korean culture tourism is huge, and once it is exploited, there will be boundless prospects. According to Kotler [12] and Oh [13] , city market is the space where government and visitors communicate with each other, and buyers are the market for urban products. It can be said that people who are interested in tourism products will be the market. So, on the basis of utilizing its local resources, Weihai needs to develop a definite market positioning for its exotic culture resource targeted at those who would like to experience 'Korean culture' and buy 'Korean products'.",

As for tourism resources, whether they are used in a sustainable manner or not are the key point. So this study promotes a sustainable development system of urban tourism for Weihai, while offering the above macro suggestions. As shown in Fig. 6 , urban resources are generally composed of four kinds: natural resources, historic resources, cultural resources, and other resources. In order to fulfill a sustainable development program, the government needs to protect natural and historic resources. It also needs to combine urban and tourism landscapes for the reasonable utilization of natural resources and to combine general buildings with historic buildings. As an important tourism resource, culture may become the most attractive point for tourists. As Weihai has the regional advantage of being near Korea, the local culture and Korean culture are both the main cultural resources, and the communication of the two kinds of cultures will enable them to develop sustainably. In addition, there are probably other resources that have not been developed yet; perhaps they need to be uncovered and developed by the government in order to provide sustainable development. ",

            "text": "tourism. This article has taken Weihai city as an example, analyzed the developing state of tourism, and found some existing barriers, using a questionnaire and field survey. The study found that Weihai should develop a new tourism resource, exotic culture, offered by its regional advantage of being near Korea, in order to change the situation of having no competitive tourism advantage compared with other coastal cities in China and achieve sustainable development of urban tourism. For this purpose, the article performed an analysis of the value of Korean culture in Weihai, and it also illustrated the advantages of the Korean tourism model. Through analysis of the Korean culture resource potential in Weihai, this research proposed the following schemes: 1) utilize Korean culture resource reasonably; 2) position the market for Korean culture; 3) make tourism marketing scientific; 4) cooperate with the Korean government in tourism development; and 5) build a sustainable development system of urban tourism, by means of which Weihai's tourism will be able to develop sustainably.Our research team will keep a close watch on projects related to Korean culture resources promoted by the Weihai city government and distribute questionnaires and field surveys periodically in order to evaluate the situation of Weihai's tourism development of Korean culture resources.",
