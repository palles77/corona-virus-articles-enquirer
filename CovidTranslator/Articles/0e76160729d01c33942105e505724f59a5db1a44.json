Coexpression of SCoV S protein and E, M and N proteins of mouse hepatitis virus in 293T or CHO cells resulted in the efficient production of chimeric VLPs carrying SCoV S protein. Balb/c mice inoculated with a mixture of chimeric VLPs and alum twice at an interval of four weeks were protected from SCoV challenge, as indicated by the absence of infectious virus in the lungs. The same groups of mice had high levels of SCoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, while mice in the negative control groups, which were not immunized with chimeric VLPs, failed to manifest neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that SCoV-specific neutralizing antibodies are important for the suppression of viral replication within the lungs. Despite some differences in the cellular composition of inflammatory infiltrates, we did not observe any overt lung pathology in the chimeric-VLPtreated mice, when compared to the negative control mice. Our results show that chimeric VLP can be an effective vaccine strategy against SCoV infection.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged disease caused by SARS coronavirus (SCoV). SARS originated in Southern China in 2002 and spread to five different continents causing >8000 infection and >700 deaths before its apparent eradication as a human infection in 2004 [1] . Healthcare systems in affected areas were severely stressed and additional economic costs in trade and travel were very high. It is not known if the virus will be reintroduced into the human population but ancestral coronaviruses are widely distributed in bats and are thought to have adapted to civets and then to humans in recent time periods [2, 3] . Because emerging viruses tend to reemerge as conditions change [4] , it is highly desirable to develop safe and efficacious vaccines and/or antivirals to prevent SCoV infections.",

Coronavirus S protein is responsible for virus adsorption to susceptible cells through a specific virus-receptor interaction and induces membrane fusion between viral envelope and host cell membrane [5] . S protein is a main player for determining coronavirus tissue tropism, host specificity and viral pathogenicity [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Because most coronavirus neutralizing antibodies recognize S protein [1, 13] , it is not surprising that most of the current SCoV vaccine candidates are either the S protein subunit itself or those carrying S protein [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Furthermore, prophylactic administration of monoclonal antibodies directed at the SCoV S protein protects animals against subsequent SCoV challenge [20] [21] [22] [23] . These studies point out that neutralizing antibodies that recognize SCoV S protein are sufficient to prevent or decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with SCoV infection by primarily suppressing replication of the challenge virus.",

The assay for virusspecific neutralizing antibodies was performed on serial 2-fold diluted samples of each serum beginning at a dilution of 1:5 using 2% FBS-DMEM as the diluent in 96-well tissue culture plates (Falcon 3072); the final volume of the serially diluted samples in each well was 60 l. After addition of 120 TCID 50 of SCoV in 60 l into each well, the samples were incubated for 45-60 min at room temperature. Then 100 l of these mixtures, containing 100 TCID 50 of SCoV, were transferred into duplicate wells of confluent Vero E6 cells grown in 96-well microtiter plates. After 72 h incubation, when the virus control wells exhibited advanced virus-induced CPE, the neutralizing capacity of individual serum samples was assessed by determining the presence or absence of virusinduced CPE. SCoV-specific neutralizing antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the last dilution of serum that completely inhibited virus-induced CPE.",

The number of mice used for (B) and (C) were: 7 for placebo, SCoV, and 2 g chimeric VLP with PBS; 6 for 2 g chimeric VLP with alum; 5 for MHV VLP with alum and 1 g chimeric VLP with alum; 4 for 0.5 g chimeric VLP with alum; and 3 for all other groups. was detectable in the lungs of any of the mice given live virus i.n. or two doses of 2 g chimeric VLP mixed with alum. The mean lung virus titers for the latter two groups were statistically different from the mean pulmonary SCoV titer seen in the placebo control group when these means were compared using a non-parametric ANOVA test (both p values being <0.01). Overall, the virus levels in these animals generally correlated inversely with those of SCoVspecific neutralizing antibodies present in the sera of the mice.",

The bronchial epithelium appeared to be the main affected target with prominent cellular cytoplasmic swelling and blebbing. Extensive accumulation of cellular debris and necrotic epithelial cells, accompanied by inflammatory infiltrates, occurred in some bronchioles (Fig. 4A) . We also observed a moderate infiltration of mononuclear cells around peribronchiolar and perivascular regions of infected tissues and a mild-to-moderate thickening of the bronchiolar interstitial tissues and alveolar walls with mononuclear cell infiltration (Fig. 4B) . IHC staining demonstrated the presence of SCoV N protein within bronchiolar epithelial cells, but not within cells of alveolar lining (Fig. 4C) . In contrast to the prominent pathology and viral replication in the lungs of the control animals, mild interstitial pneumonia was found, upon viral challenge, in the mice previously immunized with mixtures of either chimeric VLP and PBS, or chimeric VLP and alum, and in those infected with live SCoV (Fig. 4D, E, G, H) . Specifically, cytopathology, i.e., swelling and blebbing, was rarely observed in bronchiolar epithelial cells, despite the presence of some desquamated cells within the airway lumen. Additionally, the thickening of bronchiolar interstitial tissues and the alveolar wall and cellular infiltration were less prominent when compared with those of the control groups. There was no big difference in the lung pathology between mice inoculated with VLP and PBS and those inoculated with VLP and alum. We noticed that inflammatory mononuclear cells seemed to be the main, if not only, cellular component of the cellular infiltrates around the peribronchiolar and perivascular regions of mice initially primed with live SCoV.",

It appears that chimeric VLPs produced from mammalian cells in this study were more immunogenic than were SCoV VLPs produced by using a baculovirus-expression system [38] ; immunization of the mice four times with 100 g of the baculovirus-derived SCoV VLPs in each immunization elicited neutralizing antibody titers that were no longer higher than those obtained in the present study. Use of inactivated SCoV as a SCoV vaccine is a similar vaccine strategy that was explored in the present study. Others reported that immunizing mice twice with 1 g of double-inactivated SCoV with alum elicited high titers of neutralizing antibodies [50] . A major negative aspect of the use of inactivated SCoV vaccines is that extreme care must be taken to completely inactivate infectious SCoV in the vaccine preparations. In contrast, a VLP-based vaccine strategy eliminates this safety concern.",

Accordingly, we were surprised to find the efficient production of chimeric VLPs carrying SCoV S protein and MHV-derived N, M and E proteins. The present data suggest that the endodomain of SCoV S protein interacted efficiently with MHV M protein and assembled into VLPs. The endodomain of coronavirus S proteins has two partially overlapping sub-regions, a N-terminal, \u223c18-residue-long, cysteine-rich region and a C-terminal, \u223c27-residue-long, charge-rich region (Fig. 5) . MHV lacking the very C-terminal 12-amino-acid segment of the S protein endodomain is viable and replicates well in cell culture, suggesting that the removal of 12 carboxy-terminal residues does not inhibit interactions between the mutant S protein and the M protein [25, 26] . In contrast, replication is severely impaired in MHV mutants lacking the very C-terminal 22 amino acids or 25 amino acids of the S protein endodomain, i.e., constituting the majority of the charge-rich region [26] . Furthermore, a single point mutation of a charged amino acid to alanine in the charge-rich region of the endodomain has no detectable effect on the incorporation of a heterologous protein containing MHV S endodomain into virions, whereas mutants containing multiple charged residues-toalanine significantly reduce the incorporation of the protein into virions [26] . These data suggest that the charge-rich region of the endodomain plays a key role in the selective inclusion of the S protein into the virion. We noted that there were 6 charged residues between the transmembrane domain and the C-terminal 12 amino acids in both SCoV and MHV, while only 3 charged residues are found in feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) (Fig. 5) . FIPV S protein is not assembled into VLPs or viruses that carry MHV M, N and E proteins [25] . Accordingly, the presence of the same number of charged residues at the region of the endodomain, which is considered to be important for S protein assembly into virus particles, in both SCoV and MHV implies that both viruses had a similar structure in this portion of the endodomain, allowing them to interact with MHV M protein.",

The lack of heterologous protection confirmed that the SCoV S protein is the relevant constituent of the chimeric VLPs. As has been observed in other VLP systems [61, 62] , the particles themselves are immunogenic after 1 or 2 injections and provided protection when challenge was carried out after the second i.m. injection of only 2 g. Addition of alum adjuvant enhanced induction of neutralizing antibodies, and indeed titers reached those post-infection after two injections of 2 g. All VLP groups had significant protection as evidenced by reduction in lung viral titers 2 days after virulent virus challenge, the optimum time to detect replication in the Balb/c mouse [23] . Higher neutralizing antibody titers correlated with lower virus content, and the 2 g plus alum groups had no detectable virus. Overall, our data were in agreement with past reports revealing the importance of SCoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, most of which recognize S protein, for curbing SCoV replication in the lung [21, [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] .",

In this regard, chimeric VLPs carrying MHV N protein or those lacking N protein (unpublished data) could eliminate the possible induction of SCoV N protein-induced immunopathology. The efficient production of chimeric VLP from CHO cells as we report in this study is promising as a new strategy for preparing VLP-based SCoV vaccine from mammalian cells; its suitability for preparing large quantities of VLP-based vaccine against SCoV remains to be determined. Further improvements of chimeric VLP production, e.g., codon-optimization of the SCoV S gene and MHV N, M and E genes in the expression plasmids and development of an inexpensive transfection reagent and/or procedure, would be required for the substantial enhancement of chimeric VLP production.",

It has been reported that antibodies that neutralize most human SCoV isolates enhance entry of a SCoV isolate from the civet in the cell culture level [74] , but it is unclear whether ADE occurs in animals that are immunized with SCoV vaccine candidates. We did not observe signs of ADE in our study; the mice that were immunized with chimeric VLPs or initially inoculated with SCoV efficiently suppressed challenged SCoV replication. S protein in chimeric VLPs was derived from a SCoV Urbani strain, which was also used as the challenge virus, and VLPs induced antibodies that readily neutralized SCoV in vitro. In this regard, it is worth noting that immunization of mice with a Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon carrying S protein of the Urbani strain showed only limited protection against heterologous SCoV that contained S gene from the human GD03 isolate [68] .",

Staining with SCoV monoclonal antibody to N protein, we also found SCoV antigen within bronchiolar epithelial cells after challenge of unimmunized mice. Consistent with the SCoV titers in the lungs, no viral antigen was detected in the lungs of the mice inoculated with chimeric VLPs. The absence of SCoV antigen in the lungs of VLP-immunized mice or mice pre-exposed to live virus, as indicated by the results of IHC staining (Fig. 4B) , strongly argue for the efficacy of chimeric VLPs in protecting against SARS-CoV infection. SCoV-induced histopathological changes that were detected in unimmunized mice in our study appeared to be similar or slightly more severe, especially with respect to the changes in the bronchioles, than those described in the report of Subbarao et al. [23] . After SCoV challenge, the mice immunized with chimeric VLPs showed mixed peribronchiolar inflammatory infiltrates and a slight thickening of the peribronchiolar interstitium and alveolar walls. These lesions in immunized mice were milder than seen in unimmunized mice, demonstrating the effects of chimeric VLP immunization in suppressing SCoVinduced cytopathological changes in the lungs. The mice immunized with a mixture of chimeric VLP and alum had higher neutralizing antibody titers than did those immunized with a mixture of the chimeric VLP and PBS, while both groups of the mice showed similar levels of SCoV-induced lung cytopathology, suggesting neither alum nor neutralizing antibody titers were sole determinant of the severity of inflammatory responses. Possible cellular immune responses against chimeric VLP proteins were suggested by the observation that the mice inoculated with a mixture of chimeric VLPs and PBS and that of chimeric VLPs and alum, but not other groups of mice, showed infiltration of neutrophils and eosinophils around the bronchioles and blood vessels. In contrast, it has been reported that immunization of mice with a mixture of inactivated SCoV with adjuvant MF59 primary elicited humoral immune response [75] . Further investigation, using not only Balb/c mice but also other SCoV susceptible mice [41, 76, 77] and other animal models [78, 79] , will be necessary to evaluate the implications and impact of cellular immune activities, including pulmonary infiltration of neutrophils and eosinophils, as well as the utility of chimeric VLPs as a SCoV vaccine.",
