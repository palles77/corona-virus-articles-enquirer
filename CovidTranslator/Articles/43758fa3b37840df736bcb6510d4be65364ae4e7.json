Public transportation is not only a bridge through which infections travel from one location to another but also a place where infections occur since individuals are typically in close proximity to each other due to the limited space in these systems. A mathematical model is constructed to study the spread of an infectious disease through such systems. A variant of the next generation method is proposed and used to provide upper and lower bounds of the basic reproduction number for the model. Our investigation indicates that increasing transportation efficiency, and improving sanitation and ventilation of the public transportation system decrease the chance of an outbreak occurring. Moreover, discouraging unnecessary travel during an epidemic also decreases the chance of an outbreak. However, reducing travel by infectives while allowing susceptibles to travel may not be enough to avoid an outbreak.",

For example, Sattenspiel and Dietz [18] investigated the spread of infectious disease among discrete geographical regions with the assumption that people travel between them. Using demographic analysis adapted from [18] , Arino and van den Driessche proposed a multi-city SIS epidemic model and found explicit bounds on the basic reproduction number R 0 [2] . Hyman and LaForce modeled the disease spread among multiple cities using a system of deterministic differential equations and analyzed the reproductive number and the sensitivity of the model [12] . Numerical simulation results of the model were also compared with the CDC influenza data. An n-patch SIS model with immigration of susceptible and infective individuals was proposed by Wang and Zhao [22] and a threshold which determines the persistence and extinction of the epidemic was obtained. This model was further investigated by Jin and Wang [13] , and Zhang and Zhao [25] ; the latter assumes that some coefficients in the model proposed in [22] are periodic with a common period. Recently, Yang et al. [24] studied both SIR and SIS epidemic models with bilinear incidence and migration between two patches (locations). They obtain the basic reproduction numbers, which govern the stabilities of the disease-free equilibrium. These studies investigated the spatial spread of different kinds of diseases among two or more locations.",

We consider a disease spreading between multiple locations (nodes) through a transportation system with a single hub, ignoring any connections between this sub-system and the rest of the global transportation system. Understanding how the epidemic spreads through this sub-system is fundamental to studying the disease spread through the world-wide transportation network. In order to appreciate the effect that the transportation system may have on the epidemic spread, we also ignore any other transportation connections between these locations (nodes) and the hub (in particular, we assume there is no direct connection between any two nodes). Here we consider an SIRS disease model. That is, for each location, the population is divided into susceptibles, infecteds and recovereds. Modifications based on other standard epidemiological factors (e.g. exposed classes) or the effect of specific travel routes can be incorporated into the model, but that lies beyond the scope of the current work.",

Aerosolized viruses and germs can originate from a patient's mouth and nose through sneezing, coughing, laughing or speaking [9, 14, 17] . After leaving the human body, these pathogens can remain suspended in the air contained in aerosol particles or tiny droplets, or stay on surfaces for an extended period of time [3, 14, 17] . Recent investigations indicate that the SARS coronavirus can survive on a surface for up to 3 days [4] , while influenza A and B viruses are capable of remaining contagious on a surface for up to 48 h [3] . By touching such a surface, even without being close to the infectives, the susceptibles may become infected [3, 4] .",

In fact, even when no infectives travel (i.e. a \u00bc 0), a disease can still spread by means of the transportation system when the disease-free equilibrium is asymptotically stable in each isolated city ( Fig. 1(d) ). In this case, the disease initially spreads from infected people within the transportation system (so I T \u00f00\u00de > 0) dispersing to the cities. 2 To control the disease in these circumstances, infected people in the transportation system must be prevented from infecting people in the cities when they return there. For example, if infected people leaving the transportation system can be identified, then they could be placed in quarantine. The health condition of the public transportation system as measured by b T also has significant influence on the epidemic spreading through such systems. On one hand, the limited room in these systems means passengers in the system are typically in close proximity to each other. On the other hand, shared facilities in the public transportation system increases the chance of indirect transmission. Thus, the transmission rate in the public transportation is potentially higher than that in a city. However, this transmission rate can still be decreased by regularly disinfecting the public transportation system environment, installing ventilation equipment, and maintaining and cleaning vehicles regularly. 2 However, if both I T \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0 and a \u00bc 0, the disease will die out.",

With fewer infectives entering the public transportation system, infection within the system will decrease. As a result, epidemic spread in the cities will decrease accordingly. However, as shown in Fig. 1(d) , decreasing a by installing clinical thermometers at the entrances of the inter-city public transportation system does not always return the system to a stable disease-free equilibrium, even when the disease would die out in isolated cities.

However, in a cleaner public transportation system, the effect of decreasing a is more pronounced in decreasing the spread of the disease.

Instead, even if the disease would die out in isolated regions and infectives are prevented from travelling, an epidemic could be maintained by an infective population within the transit system. Here, infective travellers still conclude their travel like everyone else, but on average infect enough susceptibles during their normal travel that an outbreak occurs. This possibility requires transmission to be relatively easy within the transit system (i.e. b T or / is large, or p is small) and also requires infectives to be already within the transit system before control measures are put in place to prevent them from entering. (For a model with an exposed or latent phase, this may not be the case.) In the case where the cities or regions differ in size and the contact rate takes the general form, the basic reproduction number R 0 is estimated (Theorem 1). A condition on the parameters, which guarantees the stability of the disease-free equilibrium, is given, as is another condition, which guarantees its instability.",

Potentially, early detection of outbreaks may benefit from focusing resources on the more populated regions, especially if the transmission rates are small enough that the disease cannot spread in the isolated cities. Further studies should be performed to explore the validity of this notion in a range of meta-population models.",

Thelogarithm of the basic reproduction number log Rs0 of system (34) is shown as (a) p is varied from 0:5 to 1 and / is varied from 0 to 0:002; (b) b T0 is varied from 0:7 to 0:8 and a is varied from 0 to 1. The solid curve denotes the points where the basic reproduction number Rs0 \u00bc 1 (i.e., log Rs0 \u00bc 0). The disease-free equilibrium is stable for parameter values corresponding to points under this curve and unstable for those above.",
