Sixty herds with a herd size of \u2265160 cows were visited once between December 2005 and March 2006. Thirty herds were known to have low mortality (LM) and 30 were known high mortality herds (HM). Upon the visit, data about housing and management was collected from interviews with personnel responsible for the calves. The herd status regarding the calves' passive transfer (total protein), levels of \u2423-tocopherol, \u2424-carotene and retinol, and excretion of faecal pathogens (Cryptosporidium spp., Escherichia coli F5, rota and corona virus) was evaluated based on targeted sampling of high risk calf groups; in each herd, blood and faecal samples were collected from calves 1-7 and 1-14 days old, respectively. Similarly, the herd status regarding clinical respiratory disease in calves and history of respiratory virus exposure was evaluated based on lung auscultations and blood samplings of calves 60-90 days old. The median calf mortality risk (in calves 1-90 days of age) among HM herds was 9% (Range: 6-24%) and among LM herds 1% (Range: 0-2%). LM and HM herds were compared using five logistic regression models, covering potential risk factors within different areas: \"Disease susceptibility\", \"Factors affecting the gastrointestinal tract\", \"Factors related to transmission of infectious disease\", \"Hygiene\" and \"Labour management\". The percentage of calves, 1-7 days old, with inadequate serum concentrations of \u2423-tocopherol and \u2424-carotene were significantly higher in HM herds compared to LM herds and also associated with higher odds of being a HM herd (OR = 1.02; p = 0.023 and OR = 1.05; p = 0.0028, respectively). The variable \"Average number of faecal pathogens in the sampled target group\" was significantly associated with higher odds of being a HM herd (OR = 4.65; p = 0.015), with a higher average in HM herds. The percentage of calves with diarrhoea treated with antibiotics was significantly higher in HM herds and was associated with higher odds of being a HM herd (OR = 1.08; p = 0.021). The median age at death of calves in the age interval 1-90 days that died during a oneyear period was significantly lower among HM herds (13 days) than in LM herds (24 days) (p = 0.0013) The results indicate that gastrointestinal disorders may be an important cause of calf mortality in large Swedish dairy herds. Furthermore, our study provides additional indications that fat soluble vitamins might play an important role for calf health.",

Inadequate vitamin status has been associated with higher calf mortality during the first week after birth (Lotthammer, 1979) . Several authors have reported an association between high calf mortality and increasing herd size (Speicher and Hepp, 1973; Hartman et al., 1974; Lance et al., 1992; Nielsen et al., 2002) , whereas other studies found no (Jenny et al., 1981) or little correlation (James et al., 1984) . Swedish dairy herds are rapidly getting larger. Between 1997 and 1998, the average dairy herd size was 35 cows, but had increased to 55 cows between (Swedish Dairy Association, 2008 . In 2009, 5.4% of the herds affiliated to the Swedish official milk recording scheme had a herd size of 150 cows or more (Swedish Dairy Association, 2010) .",

Jugular blood samples were therefore collected in each herd using this approach. If fewer than three calves in the age interval were available in the herd, no samples were collected from that herd.

This age group was targeted because we wanted to characterize the herds with respect to the presence of infectious agents causing diarrhoea and affecting neonates, with focus on E. coli F5, Cryptosporidium spp., BCV and rota virus. The objective was not to assess within-herd prevalence of the agents, but rather to assess whether agents were present or not. The underlying assumption was that if there were a significant problem with any of these agents, the prevalence within the group of interest (calves 1-14 days of age) would be at least 50%. We estimated the expected maximum number of calvings over a two-week period to be 30 (based on the largest herd in the study). In herds with five or more calves in the age group, we needed to sample 5 calves to detect the presence of the agents at the design prevalence, with a confidence of 95% and assuming a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 90% (Cameron and Baldock, 1998) . If there were fewer than five calves present, all available calves in that age group were sampled. A sensitivity of 0.9 will possibly be an overestimate for some of the four assays used (see below) (and an underestimate for others), but the decision to work with one design prevalence and one overall sensitivity estimate was made on practical grounds. To further increase the likelihood of detecting the presence of the agents, we adopted a risk-based approach and prioritized sampling of diarrhoeic calves. If no diarrhoeic calves were present, the youngest calves in the age group were sampled; once again to maximize the likelihood of detecting the agents, given they were present.",

For the two variables last mentioned, only a small number of observations were missing (<5%), but for the other five variables up to 13 herds had missing values. In these herds there was a lack of calves to sample at the visit, most often because bull calves had been sold at four days of age. In multivariable regression analyses, records with missing observations are automatically omitted, which may introduce serious bias (Rubin, 1987) . It is therefore important to address this issue. In this study, another specific reason for concern was the limited sample size, where loss of data also would lead to a decreased power of detecting differences between the groups. Therefore, the missing values for these seven variables were imputed. Multiple imputation (MI) by chained equations as suggested by van Buuren and Knook (1999) was used. Five sets of data with imputed missing values were created using all candidate variables for the model in question as predictors.",

An increased risk of diarrhoea during the first week after birth in calves born to dams deficient in \u2424-carotene and in calves with low serum levels of \u2424-carotene has been shown (Lotthammer, 1979; Puls, 1994; Sivula et al., 1996a; Kume and Toharmat, 2001) . Furthermore, several studies have reported that the serum levels of \u2423-tocopherol are important for the immune system of the calf, e.g. by stimulating immune cell function (Reddy et al., 1986; Rajaraman et al., 1998; Higuchi and Nagahata, 2000) . The immune defense is essential for the resistance to infectious diseases. \u2423-Tocopherol can also act as an antioxidant (Bendich, 1993) . Only very small amounts of \u2423-tocopherol and \u2424-carotene are transferred from cow to calf via the placenta (Van Saun et al., 1989; Nonnecke et al., 1999; Zanker et al., 2000) . Therefore, it is essential that the calf is supplied with adequate amounts of \u2423-tocopherol and \u2424-carotene via colostrum. If the vitamin status of the dam is low before and at calving the concentration in colostrum will also be low, resulting in less vitamins for the calf. For best effect, the vitamins should be supplemented via colostrum within 6-7 h after birth (Zanker et al., 2000) . In our study, a correlation between FPT and inadequate levels of \u2424-carotene or \u2423-tocopherol at herd level was not identified, which indicates that the reason for differences is inadequate levels of immunoglobulin and vitamins in colostrum rather than inadequate feeding of colostrum. Our results imply that evaluating calves' vitamin status can be of clinical value in herds with high mortality problems.",

The data was collected at the herd visits and reflects the herds' management strategies rather than being a direct measure of the percentage calves treated. The result might be due to farmers in HM herds being less reluctant to use antibiotics to treat their diarrhoeic calves since they have lost many calves, or to diarrhoeic calves showing more severe clinical signs in HM herds. The latter explanation is supported by our finding of an association between average number of faecal pathogens in the sampled target group and type of herd in the model \"Hygiene\". The result may also be due to antibiotic treatment causing an imbalance of the gastrointestinal flora, making the calves more susceptible to pathogens (Roy, 1980) . Sivula et al. (1996a) reported increased enteritis morbidity in farms where healthy calves were given prophylactic antibiotic injections. In a recent study, Berge et al. (2009) found that calves treated prophylactically with antibiotics had higher incidence of diarrhoea compared to calves that were treated only when showing clinical signs of diarrhoea with fever or depressed attitude. Sawant et al. (2005) reported that the most common indication for antibiotic usage in dairy calves was enteritis and that 70% of 113 Pennsylvanian farms fed medicated milk replacers. In Sweden, prophylactic use of antibiotics is prohibited and the farmers need a prescription by a veterinarian to get antibiotics for treatment of clinical disease. Ortman and Svensson (2004) reported that diarrhoea was the second most common cause for treatment with antimicrobial drugs (next to respiratory disease) and that 86.4% of such treatment was given within 90 days of age. A reflection is that in our study, only one sample out of 287 was positive for E. coli F5, i.e. contained a bacterial pathogen against which antibiotics could theoretically be effective. Instead Cryptosporidium spp. and rota virus were the most common pathogens, indicating that overall, the beneficial effect of antibiotics should be limited.",

It was therefore surprising that a higher number of animals housed in the same building as calves 4-30 days of age decreased the odds of being a HM herd, as the opposite was expected. A similar effect was seen with the percentage calves 60-90 days of age with antibodies to BRSV, which also decreased the odds of being a HM herd. However, maternal antibodies to BRSV can be detected for long periods and the higher percentage of BRSV positive calves in LM herds might be an indirect reflection of the mothers' BRSV status (Elvander, 1996) and/or an effect of better colostrum routines. Consequently, one interpretation could be that calves in LM herds are better protected in case of a challenge with BRSV, and develop less severe clinical response with fewer deadly outcomes.",

In our study, calvings in HM herds tended to occur more frequently in free stalls (>10% of calvings) (p = 0.051). This was not used as a practice; it was accidental when it happened. It is possible that calving in free stalls results in a greater number of calves that are abandoned, or that cross-suckling occurs, which can lead to reduced colostral intake making calves more susceptible to pathogens. In other studies, where most calves were born in free stalls, the suckling frequency was reduced and calf mortality in the first week of life was significantly increased (Streit and Ernst, 1992; Kjaestad and Simensen, 2001) .",

The low median age at death among the HM herds in the present study (13 days) as compared with LM herds (24 days) therefore indicates that diarrhoea might be a cause of the elevated mortality risk in HM herds. In a study carried out on 63 Dutch dairy farms, the median age at occurrence of diarrhoea was 8 days (Perez et al., 1990) . Waltner-Toews et al. (1986a) and Svensson et al. (2003) reported that the incidence of calf diarrhoea peaked during the second week after birth.",

With only two bulk milk samples with antibodies positive for Salmonella Dublin or Salmonella Typhimurium, one in each group, the higher calf mortality risk in HM herds is not likely to be explained by Salmonellosis. However a possible limitation of antibody tests on bulk milk from large dairy herds is that antibodies from a few infected cows may be diluted causing falsely negative results. In many countries, BVDV is endemic , and can be a major cause of impaired calf health (de Verdier Klingenberg et al., 1999) . Due to the successful Swedish BVDV eradication programme, BVDV is, however, no longer a major contributor to calf mortality in Sweden. In the present study, two LM herds were positive for BVDV. They were not excluded from the study as they had a consistently twelve-month herd level calf mortality risk from the period September 2003-2006.",

Of course, one weakness with this approach is that it was not possible to control for/investigate joint effects of the variables that were significant in the respective models.
