This \"down-up-down\" regulation of RNA synthesis distinguishes different viral stages: primary translation, genome replication, and finally viron assembly. Regarding the nsp8 as the primase in RNA synthesis, we confirmed that the proteolysis product of the primase (nsp8) contains the globular domain (nsp8C), and indentified the resectioning site that is notably conserved in all the three groups of coronavirus. We subsequently crystallized the complex of SARS-CoV nsp8C and nsp7, and the 3-D structure of this domain revealed its capability to interfuse into the hexadecamer super-complex. This specific proteolysis may indicate one possible mechanism by which coronaviruses to switch from viral infection to genome replication and viral assembly stages.

However, in the light of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome sequencing, bioinformatical studies have predicted the function of nsp12 (RNAdependent RNA polymerase), nsp5 (main protease), nsp13 (endo-ribonuclease), nsp14 (helicase), nsp15 (exoribonuclease) and nsp16 (methyltransferase), and domains of nsp3 (ADRP and papain-like protease) (Prentice et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2003) . These analyses also indicate that the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV nsp8 contains an RNA binding motif that is widely shared by helicases, telomereassociated proteins and other single strand nucleotide binding proteins (Imbert et al., 2006) . Nsp8 can also interact with nsp7, presumably for stabilization purposes, and the crystal structure of the nsp7-nsp8 super complex provided the first glance into the machinery of SARS replication and transcription complex (Zhai et al., 2005) . The ability of the nsp7-nsp8 complex to bind nucleic acid was first characterized by Zhai et al. (2005) , using random RNA and DNA sequences as substrates. In the same study, mutagenesis experiments targeting several positively charged residues demonstrated that the end of the extended substrate tail is crucial for nucleic acid affinity. Subsequent experimental assays concerning RNA with different sequences (Imbert et al., 2006) confirmed the role of the long helix motif of nsp8 in nucleic acid binding.",

The cellular factor poly(rC) binding protein (PCBP2, also known as HnRNP K2) is reported to participate in both the initiation of translation and RNA replication (Graff et al., 1998) . In addition, the mechanism of switching from viral protein synthesis to RNA replication was found to occur via proteolysis of the key regulator PCBP2 (Perera et al., 2007) . As a result of the action of the 3CD proteinase, the third domain of PCBP2 is truncated and viral translation is thus switched off. For coronaviruses, viral development in infected cells can follow similar stages subsequent to virus entry (Stertz et al., 2007) . By analyzing the viral RNA synthesis, it is reported that the plus strand synthesis of SARS-CoV in cells declines to undetectable levels by 12 hours post-infection (h.p.i.) (Sawicki et al., 2007) , when the infection stage moves from RNA synthesis to viral assembly.",

Based on primase assays and structure comparison, Imbert and colleagues identified this nsp7-nsp8 complex as a second RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in SARS-CoV, generating 6 nt RNA primers for further elongation carried out by the major RdRp, nsp12 (Imbert et al., 2006) . The indispensability of this secondary RdRp/nsp8 was subsequently confirmed by Deming et al. (2007) .

Nsp2 has an isoform that is 15 kDa shorter than the predicted full-length protein, while nsp8 has a second band that is 8 kDa shorter.

Unfortunately, due to the scarcity of viral nsp8 in infected cells, the precise position of resectioning under physiological conditions is unknown. However, we were able to make predictions from the molecular weight, immunological mapping results, nearphysiological studies and structural clues, as discussed below. Coronaviruses include members from three groups: group 1 (e.g., human coronavirus 229E), group 2A (e.g., human coronavirus HKU1) and 2B (e.g., SARS-CoV), and group 3 (e. g., avian infectious bronchitis virus). We aligned the nsp8 sequences from all of these groups and discovered features, including a \"resectioning marker\" (R-Loop), which is notably conserved in one of the most variable parts of the entire nsp8 sequence (Fig. 2) . Based on this, we hypothesized that proteolysis of nsp8 might occur in the cells infected by CoVs from other groups.",

Only half of the nsp8s (termed nsp8II, or \"bent golf club\") possess such loops, while the four straight nsp8s (nsp8I, or \"regular golf club\") molecules adopt a straight helical \"shaft\" in the corresponding region. The unstructured loop presumably indicates instability. We hypothesized that resectioning might first occur at these regions, and then by compromising the integrity of the channel, nsp8I could be destabilized thereafter.

(2006) the gross fold of C-terminal domain of the nsp8 resembles the structure of hnrnp A1 (PDBID 2UP1), which is a single nucleotide binding protein (Fig. 5B ) in human cells.

The replication of coronaviruses can be divided into two steps: replication of the genome and virus assembly. The regulatory tilting point between the two steps is ambiguous; however, we here propose a possible mechanism by which the virus could regulate the switching point. The amount of viral RNA is directly related to the RNA polymerization reaction that requires both the primase and RdRp. After proteolysis, nsp8C may regulate RNA synthesis through remodeling the components of primase.",

Proteosome-and endosome-based protein degradations are two of the major pathways for the cell to process the relevant proteins. However, proteases in these pathways usually degrade proteins to oligo-peptides or single residues. In addition, apoptosis-related caspases are responsible for a large amount of protein degradation but in a more sequence-specific manner. To determine the relevance between the host caspase and nsp8 processing, we performed a series of experiments in which infected cells were incubated with the presence of caspase 3 inhibitors in media. However, no inhibition of nsp8 resectioning was detected, suggesting that the caspase pathway may not directly cause nsp8 proteolysis (Supplemental Fig. 1) . Further experiments are required to evaluate other possible proteolytic agents. However, it should be noted that the in vitro degradation of nsp8 in the absence of known protease indicates that the inherent instability of nsp8 itself should not be neglected. ",
