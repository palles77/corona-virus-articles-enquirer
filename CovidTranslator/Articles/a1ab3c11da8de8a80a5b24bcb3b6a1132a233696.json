Reaction of (R)-propanediol carbonate with 2,6-diaminopurine afforded exclusively (R)-9-(2-hydroxypropyl)-2,6-diaminopurine which was subsequently used for introduction of a phosphonomethyl residue using TsOCH 2 P(O)(OiPr) 2 or BrCH 2 P(O)(OiPr) 2 followed by deprotection of ester groups. All minor ingredients and by-products formed during the process were identified and further studied. The final product was obtained in high yield and its high enantiomeric purity (>99%) was confirmed by chiral capillary electrophoretic analysis using b-cyclodextrin as a chiral selector. Antiretroviral activity data of (R)-PMPDAP and its diverse prodrugs against HIV and FIV were investigated. Akin to (R)-PMPDAP, both prodrugs inhibit FIV replication in a selective manner. Compared to the parent molecule, the amidate prodrug was 10-fold less active against FIV in cell culture, whereas the alkoxyalkyl ester prodrug was 200-fold more potent in inhibiting FIV replication in vitro.",

This nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) can be used by itself (Viread\u2122) or in combination with other antiretroviral agents (Truvada\u2122, Atripla\u2122). The highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) based on treatment using combinations of several antiretroviral drugs is now preferable and over the past decade it has led to significant declines in HIV-associated morbidity and mortality. 5 In 2008, the same compound, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was also approved for the treatment of hepatitis B as a drug operating on inhibitory effects towards HBV polymerase. 6, 7 At present, tenofovir has become the most commercially successful drug for the treatment of HIV and HBV infections. Surprisingly, the 2-amino congener of tenofovir, 9-[2-(R)-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]-2,6-diaminopurine ((R)-PMPDAP), prepared by Hol\u00fd almost 20 years ago has not been thus far sufficiently studied, despite the fact that it is 10-fold more potent against HIV-1 compared to PMPA in vitro and in vivo. 8, 9 On the other hand, initiated by the development of HIV drug resistance, there is a necessity to continue the search for new antiretroviral, especially anti-HIV, compounds. This resistance has developed despite the number of available drugs on the market or the effective Global Strategy for HIV Drug Resistance Prevention worked out by WHO. 10 In this work, we describe an optimized effective methodology for a large scale-preparation of (R)-PMPDAP, a promising future drug candidate for the treatment of HIV and/or other retroviral infections. Eventual clinical development of the compound can be supported also by our recent progress in the development of prodrugs. Preparation of prodrugs can improve bioavailability of the parent compound as well as pharmacological properties in general.",

The first method is the stepwise approach starting from the isobutyl ester of D-(\u00c0)-lactic acid. It can be converted to the tetrahydropyranyl derivative, reduced to (R)-2-(2-tetrahydropyranyloxy)propanol and tosylated. Synthesis of (R)-PMPDAP is based on alkylation of 2,6-diaminopurine with thus obtained (R)-2-(2-tetrahydropyranyloxy)propyl tosylate followed by removal of 2-tetrahydropyranyl and etherification of the free hydroxy group with diisopropyl tosyloxymethanephosphonate. 1a This process was also patented. 1b However, the total yield of the key intermediate, 9-(R)-(2-hydroxypropyl)-2,6-diaminopurine, is only 38% and the introduction of a phosphonomethyl residue followed by deprotection of ester groups via transsilylation reaction with bromotrimethylsilane and hydrolysis proceeds in the total yield 47%. The second method is based on condensation of 2,6-diaminopurine with the appropriate chiral synthon, that is, (R)-2-[bis(2-propyl)phosphonomethoxy]propyl]-p-toluenesulfonate ['(R)-PMP-synthon'], the compound prepared from (R)-1-benzyloxy-2-propanol by a multi-step process involving chloromethylation, Arbuzov reaction with triisopropyl phosphite, catalytic hydrogenation and final tosylation. 2 This method is appropriate for laboratory scale syntheses.",

The advantage of this starting material is its commercial accessibility in high optical purity together with its better reactivity and higher yields compared to above mentioned (R)-2-(2-tetrahydropyranyloxy)propyl tosylate. 1 Despite the fact that (R)-propanediol carbonate is involved in industrial synthesis of tenofovir, 12 not many synthetic details using other nucleobases are described. A short communication was published regarding its use for synthesis of (R)-PMPA but this work does not contain any experimental details. 13 Recently, another more detailed paper on the industrial synthesis of tenofovir was issued but description of by-products in this synthesis is focused mostly on the final synthetic step, that is, preparation of the prodrug form (tenofovir disoproxil) and to analytical methods for their quantification. 14 In our case, base catalyzed reaction of (R)-propanediol carbonate with 2,6-diaminopurine proceeded to form the desired (R)-9-(2-hydroxypropyl)-2,6-diaminopurine (1) in high yield (above 80%) and regiospecificity to the position N-9 (Scheme 1). As a side effect, formylation of one of the amino groups occurs, always to the N 2 position. The formylated by-product 2 can be easily transformed to 1 in aqueous alkali. Other by-products, bis(hydroxyalkyl) derivatives 3 and 4 and the elimination product 5 are formed after longer reaction time; their total quantity in the mixture is very low (<3%) and they are easily removed.",

            "text": "Introduction of a phosphonomethyl residue was performed using diisopropyl tosyloxymethanephosphonate or diisopropyl bromomethanephosphonate. 15 The first possibility does not require any protection of amino groups. Reaction performed under basic conditions in dimethylformamide afforded the desired phosphonate ester 6 accompanied by a small amount of N 2 and N 6 formyl derivatives, bis(phosphonomethyl) derivative 9 and also by a small amount of compound 5 as in previous step (Scheme 2). Both formylated products 7 and 8 could be transformed by basic hydrolysis to the desired intermediate 6 which was subsequently deprotected to the final product, (R)-PMPDAP by transsilylation reaction with bromotrimethylsilane followed by hydrolysis. 1,2 The yield of this final deprotection step leading to (R)-PMPDAP is in a range 60-80% which is in agreement with previously published data (79%). 2 An alternative method of preparation of phosphonomethyl derivatives is based on utilization of diisopropyl bromomethanephosphonate. This approach usually requires protection of amino groups. In our case, we selected a protection step with dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal. This reaction leads preferentially to mono-substituted product 11a (Scheme 3). Its further reaction with diisopropyl bromomethanephosphonate can be realized without necessity to isolate intermediates. This fact belongs to the main advantages of this process. Its particular disadvantages include complicated monitoring of the reaction course due to the presence of decomposition products originating from dimethylaminomethylene compounds and also a lower yield. Similarly as all other ANPs, (R)-PMPDAP has a highly polar character due to the presence of a free phosphonic acid function and, hence, unfavorable pharmacological properties can be expected. A phosphonate group subjected to the physiological pH deprotonates and an ionized drug molecule is mostly impermeant to the cellular membrane unless pinocytosis is involved. In addition, a phosphonate based drug can be thus absorbed by gastrointestinal tract in a limited scope which disqualifies the drug for oral applica-tion. In order to achieve oral bioavailability and intracellular delivery of ANPs, their transformation to appropriate prodrug form is highly advisable. 16 In our case, we decided to transform (R)-PMP-DAP to two structurally different types of prodrugs: an alkoxyalkyl (hexadecyloxypropyl) monoester and an amidate prodrug. The first type was synthesized by reaction of tetrabutylammonium salt of (R)-PMPDAP and hexadecyloxypropyl bromide in DMF. The reaction afforded neutral diester 13, which was subsequently transformed in alkaline conditions to hexadecyloxypropyl monoester 14 (Scheme 4 to a procedure developed originally in our laboratory: 17 an appropriate phosphonate ester (ethyl or diisopropyl) is treated with bromotrimethylsilane, followed by reaction with amino acid ester hydrochloride in a presence of triphenyl phosphine and bis(2pyridinyl)-disulfide (Aldrithiol) under basic conditions (Scheme 5). Methodology of preparation of (R)-PMPDAP utilizing (R)-propanediol carbonate enabled achievement of the final product of extraordinary optical purity. Despite the diverse manners of introduction of a phosphonomethyl group or work up of reaction mixtures, an enantiomeric purity of (R)-PMPDAP was always higher than 99%. Chiral analysis of the product was performed by capillary electrophoresis (CE) with b-cyclodextrin (b-CD) chiral selector. 18 Fast (ca. 11 min) separation of (R)-and (S)-enantiomers of PMPDAP was achieved by CE using 30 mM sodium tetraborate, adjusted by NaOH to pH 10.0 as background electrolyte (running buffer) and 20 mg/mL b-CD as chiral selector, see Figure 2a . Average enantiomeric purity degree of the analyzed samples (three batches, A-C) is given in Table 1 . High enantiomeric purity of the synthesized (R)-PMPDAP, batch B, is shown in Figure 2b .",

The reaction was completed by evaporation and heating of the residue with 2 M NaOH (10 mL) for 2 h at 110\u00b0C. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was neutralized with acetic acid to pH 6, diluted with water and the product crystallized in refrigerator. The product was collected by suction, washed with water (250 mL) and recrystallized from boiling methanol. Additional recrystallization from ethanol afforded pure product 14 as white crystals in yield 940 mg (49%). Additional portion of 14 was obtained from mother liquours by chromatography on silica gel performed in system ethyl acetate/acetone/ethanol/water, first in combination (18:3:1:1, elution of the rest of diester 13), followed by the same system in ratio (13:3:4:5) to give additional 120 mg (6%) of 14.",

Crandell Reese Feline kidney (CrFK) cells were grown in Dulbecco minimum essential medium (DMEM, Life Technologies) containing 1% sodium bicarbonate (Life Technologies) and 5% fetal calf serum (FCS, Biochrom). In a 96-well plate, a total of 5000 CrFK cells were pre-seeded and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 . Subsequently, the cells were washed with 100 ll phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 50 lg/ml DEAE-dextran and inoculated with 100 CCID 50 FIV in the presence of a serial dilution series of the test compound. Following 2 h of incubation, the supernatant was removed and the cells were washed with PBS. The infected cells were subsequently overlaid with 5% FCS containing DMEM to which a serial dilution series of the compounds was added. Infected cells without compounds were included as positive controls (virus controls) and uninfected cells were included as negative controls (cell controls). The plates were incubated for six days at which time viral supernatant was collected and analyzed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection FIV p24 antigen. A total of 100 ll supernatant was incubated for 10 min in 0.1% TritonX100 and applied on a maxisorp plate (Nunc) that was pre-coated overnight with monoclonal anti-p24 antibody (11C7C7C1) and blocked with 5% FCS in PBS. Subsequently, the amount of FIV p24 was detected by a monoclonal biotinylated antibody (5E6D11) followed by a colorimetric reaction which is based on extravidin peroxidase (Sigma) and OPD substrate (Sigma). The absorbance was read at a wavelength of 492 nm (OD 492 ). EC 50 -values were determined as the compound concentration that inhibited 50% of FIV p24 antigen detection as compared with virus controls. Cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined by incubating CrFK cells in the presence of a serial dilution series of the compounds at 37\u00b0C and under humidified conditions. After 3 days of incubation the viability of the cells was measured using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Assay (Promega) as per manufacturer's protocol. CC 50 -values were determined as the compound concentration where 50% of the cells were death as compared with cell controls.",
