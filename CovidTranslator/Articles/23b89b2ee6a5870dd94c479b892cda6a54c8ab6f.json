To identify carrier vesicles involved in regulated and constitutive secretion, PC12 pheochromocytoma cells were labeled with [33S]sulfate to identify markers for the two secretory pathways, then mechanically permeabilized and incubated in vitro. Small constitutive secretory vesicles, containing mostly sulfated proteoglycans, accumulated during an in vitro incubation with ATP In the presence of M EMBRANE traffic between compartments involves carrier vesicles that bud from a donor compartment and fuse with the acceptor compartment . To explain how membrane proteins are sorted to different organelles, we need to know how the carrier vesicle selects a subset of the proteins present in the donor membrane compartment and how it fuses exclusively with the acceptor. With these questions in mind, considerable effort has been expended in identifying carrier vesicles involved in ER to Golgi transport, intra-Golgi transport and post-trans-Golgi",

            "text": "In regulated secretory cells, there are two types of carrier vesicles that leave the TGN and fuse with the plasma membrane, the constitutive secretory vesicle and the regulated secretory granule (for review see Kelly, 1991) . The two carrier vesicles differ in the types of protein they transport and whether or not their fusion with the cell surface is regulated by cytoplasmic second messengers. Isolation ofthe two types of carrier vesicles ought to help clarify how protein sorting and regulated fusion are mediated. The pioneering study of suggested that isolation of the two classes of vesicles might be possible. To label secreted proteins in PC12 cells, they were pulse labeled with [11S]sulfate. Radioactive sulfate is incorporated into the intermediate phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate (PAPS), which is transported into the lumen of the Golgi network (Milla and Hirschberg, 1989 ) then transferred to carbohydrate chains (Rod\u00e9n, 1980) and to tyrosine residues of proteins (Huttner, 1982) . Since tyrosine sulfation of proteins occurs concomitant with or after sialic acid addition in hybridoma cells, it is thought to occur in a late trans-Golgi compartment (Baeuerle and Huttner, 1987) . The site of sulfation of proteoglycans is less well localized. showed that intact cells, labeled briefly with [3IS]sulfate, secreted only three major \"S-labeled species. Two tyrosine sulfated proteins, secretogranin II and chromogranin B, are markers for the regulated pathway while sulfated proteoglycans are a marker for the constitutive . When isolated membranes were incubated in the presence of ATP, sulfatelabeled vesicles budded from the Golgi fractions . Although vesicles containing the constitutive marker largely overlapped vesicles containing the regulated protein markers on equilibrium density gradients, enough separation was achieved to suggest that sorting was indeed occurring in vitro.",

            "text": "In principle it should be possible to explore both the formation of secretory vesicles and their docking and fusion with the plasma membrane using gently permeabilized, semi-intact cells. In semi-intact cells from the growth hormone-secreting GH3 line, mature secretory granules of the regulated pathway do not leave the cells, but release their contents when calcium levels are raised (Martin and Walent, 1989) . To use semi-intact cells to study vesicle formation, it is essential that post-Golgi carrier vesicles be able to leak from the cells (Bennett et al., 1988) . To determine if intermediates in the secretory pathway would escape from semiintact cells, we examined the release of [ 35 S]sulfate-labeled vesicles from PC12 cells . We obtained evidence that two classes of vesicles escaped, constitutive secretory vesicles and precursors of mature secretory granules. Their formation and properties were dependent on ATP, GTP, and the time between labeling and permeabilizing the cells. The small constitutive vesicles resembled the carrier vesicles released from yeast and other cells in their homogeneous sedimentation behavior. The precursors in the regulated pathway, free to diffuse out of the permeabilized cells, were much larger and may still be engaged in the sorting process as has been suggested for exocrine cells (von Zastrow and Castle, 1987) . Cell Culture, Labeling, and Pulse-Chase Experiments Five separate clones of the rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell line (Green and Tischler, 1976) were tested during the course of these experiments, and gave similar results. PC12 cells were cultured in 10% C02 in DME H21 containing 10% horse serum, and 5% FCS. Six to eight 15-cm dishes of confluent PC12 cells were washed in warm PBS, then dislodged from the plates in 10-12 ml PBS by pipetting, and transferred to a 15-ml polypropylene test tube . Cells were centrifuged 2 min at 200 g, then washed once more in PBS and centrifuged as above. The cells were resuspended in 5 ml 355042labeling medium (DME H21 without cold sulfate containing 1-2 MCi/m1 35 SO42-that had been preequilibrated at 37\u00b0C and 10% C02) . The cell suspension was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 min, then either placed on ice or centrifuged for 2 min at 200 g at room temperature, resuspended in warm DME H21 plus 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, and 1 mM MgSO4, and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for various chase periods . To examine the kinetics of secretion, the cell suspension was placed on ice, then cells and media separated by centrifugation at 1,300 g for 10 min . Media samples were centrifuged 5 min at 14,000 g and the supernatant precipitated in 10 % TCA for analysis by PAGE . Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 mM Tris, pH 9.5, 20 mM DTI', and protease inhibitor cocktail (0.1 kg/ml each pepstatin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin added from a 1,000X stock in DMSO ; 1 mM PMSF, 10 AM benzamidine, and 1 Pg/ml O-phenanthroline added from a 100x stock in ethanol) . After freezing and thawing three times, samples were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 10 min and the supernatants added to an equal volume of 2x sample buffer for PAGE. We found that 80% of proteoglycans (total of media and cells) was secreted constitutively by 1 h, while a smaller fraction of secretogranin II was secreted constitutively (30% of total by 1 h) .",

In B, or if no reaction was performed after pulse labeling (not shown), the PIM fraction contained at least 80 % of the total 35 S-cpm, without background subtraction . The arrow in C points to the vesicles released in the presence of ATP. The Sl and PIM material was fractionated on sucrose velocity gradients for 1 h at 100,000 g. velocity gradient fraction ferase is not released (Fig. 2 A) . Furthermore, the equilibrium density of the released vesicles was lower than the membranes in the cell ghosts from which they are derived (Fig. 3) . The labeled membranes from cell ghosts peaked at an equilibrium density of -1.18 g/ml before (not shown) and after warming with ATP (Fig. 3, PIM) . In contrast, the peak of radioactivity in Sl vesicles was at 1.13-1.14 g/ml (Fig. 3 , SI) . Note that there was a significant tail of labeled material in Sl membranes of higher density, in contrast to synaptophysin (p38) immunoreactivity, which peaked symmetrically at 1.133 g/ml (Fig. 3) . Thus, sulfate-labeled vesicles emerging from permeabilized cells are mostly of a single density, although a minor population are more dense. To determine ifthe sulfate-containing vesicles released from the semi-intact cells were derived from the regulated pathway, the constitutive pathway, or both, we examined the distribution of sulfated markers in the velocity and equilibrium gradients. Gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and each sulfated marker, as well as synaptophysin, was quantified . The distribution of proteoglycans across the velocity and equilibrium gradients (Fig. 4) was very similar to that of radioactivity (Fig. 2 , B and C, and Fig . 3 crose velocity gradients sedimented more rapidly than synaptic vesicles (Fig. 4 A) and had an equilibrium density of 1.13-1 .14 g/ml (Fig. 4 D) . Since proteoglycans are secreted mainly by the constitutive pathway, we tentatively conclude that the small proteoglycan-rich vesicles that accumulate in vitro are constitutive secretory vesicles . Constitutive secretory vesicles derived from the TGN have been difficult to detect in vivo, presumably because they fuse with the cell surface soon after synthesis . Ifthe vesicles were indeed constitutive in origin then their content of labeled proteoglycans should disappear rapidly during a chase . However, we found that incorporation of 35S042-into the major labeled secretory proteins, proteoglycans, chromogranin B, and secretogranin II (the sum of the amount ofeach marker in the media and cells) increased linearly for the first 15 min of the in vivo chase (Fig. 5 A) . 15 min is probably the time that is taken to deplete intracellular pools of 3sS-PAPS. Consistent with this possibility, when cells were permeabilized without chasing, the addition ofcold PAPS to the in vitro reaction reduced by 20% the amount of TCA-precipitable radioactivity in ATPreleased membranes as well as in the Golgi fractions associated with the cell ghost membranes . Incorporation into proteoglycans and secretogranin II was equally reduced by cold PAPS.",

The new peak that appeared in GTPyS had a density close to 1 .19 g/ml, suggesting coated intermediates similar to those purified by Malhotra et al . (1989) . We conclude that three separate classes of vesicles containing proteoglycans can be detected . (a) A homogeneous population of small vesicles whose accumulation depends on an in vitro incubation with ATP, which we call constitutive secretory vesicles ; (b) a small, dense class that accumulated in vitro in the presence of ATP and GTPyS, tentatively classified as coated constitutive vesicles ; and (c) a minor class of heterogeneous rapidly sedimenting vesicles that were released without an in vitro incubation with ATP and that changed their sedimentation rate with time.

            "text": "The selective sorting of secretogranin II into heterogeneous vesicles larger than the constitutive vesicles suggests that the large vesicles are precursors of regulated secretory granules . The putative immature secretory granules differ from constitutive vesicles in several ways . The addition of GTPyS to the in vitro incubation only slightly reduced the amount of secretogranin II-containing vesicles formed in vitro, and did not have a dramatic effect on their density (data not shown) . The release of immature secretory granules from the semi-intact cells thus appeared to be less sensitive to GTPyS than was the release of constitutive secretory vesicles. A second difference is that after in vivo chases of 15 and 60 min, release of secretogranin II-rich vesicles was largely ATP independent . Their velocity and equilibrium density characteristics were determined during the same pulse-chase experiment used to characterize constitutive vesicles . We found that after 15-and 60-min in vivo chases, permeabilized cells released secretogranin II-labeled vesicles without need of an in vitro incubation (Fig . 7 , B and C, no reaction) . With or without an in vitro incubation, the released vesicles had a sedimentation velocity that increased with time of chase (Fig . 7 A-C) . The immature secretory granules released from the cells also increased in density with time of chase (Fig . 7 D-F and Fig . 8 A) . To determine the density of mature secretory vesicles, cells were labeled with [35 S]sulfate for 12 h and chased for an additional 12 h . The secretogranin II-containing vesicles were associated with the cell ghosts (PIM) and had an average density of 1 .20 g/ml (Fig . 8 A) . Thus, the secretory granule precursors that are released by semi-intact cells did not reach the density of mature granules by 60 min . Despite the differences between constitutive vesicles and immature secretory granules, the radioactivity recovered in both vesicle types peaked at 15 min of chase . Because ofthe major difference in their sedimentation velocities, it has been possible to resolve experimentally constitutive vesicles from immature secretory granules and compare their properties. Constitutive vesicles were rich in sulfated proteoglycans and not detectable unless permeabilized cells are incubated with ATP Their size, density, and ratio of secretogranin II to proteoglycans remained constant, independent of chase time (Fig. 8) . The sulfate-labeled Golgi membranes from which they may arise do not leak out of the permeabilized cells. The density ofthe Golgi peak fractions (1.178 t 0.002 g/ml) and the ratio ofsecretogranin II to proteoglycans (0.08 f 0.01) also remained constant during the chase. Immature secretory granules containing secretogranin II only showed ATP-dependent release immediately after pulse 60 min chase constitutive labeling. As the chase time increased, any ATP dependent release was presumably concealed by the release of preexisting immature secretory granules from cytoplasmic pools . The density of the immature granules was less than that of the Golgi membranes immediately after the pulse (Fig. 8 A) . The immature secretory granule fractions (4-12, Fig . 7 , A-C) contained 55-85 % of the released \"S-secretogranin II, but also a minor fraction (30-40 %) ofthe released 'SS-proteoglycans . The ratio of secretogranin II to proteoglycans (0.05 t 0.02) immediately after the pulse was not significantly different from that of the Golgi fractions . Unlike the Golgi fractions, however, or the constitutive vesicles, both the density and the ratio of secretogranin II to proteoglycans in the immature granule fraction increased during an in vivo chase (Fig. 8) . little labeled proteoglycans and were denser than immature granules (Fig. 8) .",

In yeast, the GTP-binding protein SARI is required for budding from the ER and the nonhydrolyzable analogue, GTPyS, slows but may not block the budding completely (Oka et al ., 1991; Rexach and Schekman, 1991) . In mammalian cell preparations, GTPyS inhibited the formation of both regulated and constitutive carrier vesicles, but only by -50% . The fusion process also involves GTP and can usually be completely inhibited by GTPyS in ER to Golgi, intra-Golgi, and Golgi to cell surface transport (Baker et al., 1988; Ruohola et al ., 1988; Beckers and Balch, 1989; Melangon et al., 1987; Miller and Moore, 1991; Rexach and Schekman, 1991; Segev, 1991) . Nonclathrin-coated vesicles that are involved in intercisternal Golgi transport accumulate in the cell in the presence of GTPyS (Malhotra et al., 1989) . When budding from the TGN ofPC12 cells was examined in the presence of GTPyS, fewer constitutive vesicles were formed and their sedimentation velocity and equilibrium density were increased, consistent with the retention ofa coat. The partial inhibition of constitutive secretory formation (Fig. 6 A constitutive vesicle fusion has an absolute requirement for GTP hydrolysis (Miller and Moore, 1991) . The second class of vesicles released from permeabilized cells contained secretogranin II, a marker for the regulated secretory pathway. Although the secretogranin 11-rich and proteoglycan-rich vesicles could be separated by density, velocity sedimentation allowed more complete resolution (Figs. 4 and 7) . This resolution has revealed several aspects of the sorting process . Immediately after a pulse label, the release of the vesicles is ATP dependent, consistent with their formation in vitro during the incubation . They are significantly lighter than Golgi fractions and have a secretogranin II to proteoglycan ratio 2-3 times the constitutive vesicles (Fig . 8 B) . After a long chase, any ATPdependent formation of the secretogranin II-rich vesicles is obscured by ATP-independent release of pre-existing secretogranin II-rich vesicles. The density of the vesicles that accumulate during the chase is greater than that of vesicles generated in vitro, about the same as the donor Golgi membranes (Fig . 3) , but still not as dense as mature secretory vesicles. Their content, however, has a secretogranin II to proteoglycans ratio that is twice that of the Golgi at 15 min chase and four times that of the Golgi at 60 min chase . The latter ratio is 15 times greater than constitutive vesicles, and approaches that of mature vesicles (Fig . 8 B) . Such properties would be predicted for immature secretory granules but are less easy to reconcile with other possibilities such as fragmented Golgi membranes.",

Proteoglycans are represented by the branched tree, and the regulated secretory proteins (chromogranin B and secretogranin II) by the shaded diamonds and shaded core of secretory granules on the lower right . In the model, the secretory granule precursor after formation is large and light in density. During maturation it loses membrane to become more dense. Maturation by budding might also improve the sorting efficiency by removing material that is excluded from the condensed core. If such budding does occur, the vesicles could return to the Golgi, fuse with the cell surface, or both. As the vesicles mature, they become associated with the cytoskeleton and cannot escape from the cell . (Kelly, 1985 ; von Zastrow and Castle, 1987; von Zastrow et al ., 1989 ) . If small vesicles bud off, they should contain soluble proteins excluded from the proteinaceous core (Fig .  9) , and the ratio of the regulated marker, secretogranin 11, to the constitutive one, sulfated proteoglycan should increase in the granules during granule maturation . Consistent with the latter prediction, the ratio of the two markers does increase during a chase (Fig . 8 B) . Although the model outlined in Fig. 9 is consistent with the data, alternative explanations cannot be eliminated . In particular, it is important to show that newly synthesized proteoglycans and secretogranin II are actually in the same membranous intermediate .",

From their analysis of the types of protein secreted in the early phase they concluded that sorting involves condensation and continues after the formation of immature granules from the TGN . Both their model and Fig . 9 raise the issue of whether the late sorting compartments should be considered part of the TGN, or an immature secretory granule . We are experimentally classifying components that stay with the cell ghosts as Golgi associated and those intermediate vesicles that escape as immature or precursor secretory granules . Chung et al . (1989) have suggested that sorting of regulated proteins involves a receptor that recycles between the TGN and a low pH compartment that is analogous in some ways to the prelysosomal or late endosome compartment . The fraction we call immature secretory granules could in principle be such a sorting compartment in which ligand dissociates from receptor at low pH. The crucial difference be-tween the two models is whether condensation precedes sorting ( Fig . 9 ) or vice versa Tooze et al ., 1987) .",
