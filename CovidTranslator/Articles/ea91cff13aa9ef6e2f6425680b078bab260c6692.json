Monoclonal antibodies specific for IFN-y, CD4 and CDS molecules were administered in vivo to deplete selectively the IFN -y synthesized or the appropriate subset of T cells. The animals were then infected with MHV3 and the course of infection was followed by studying different parameters, such as, the mortality, the virus growth in the tissues and the IFN-y synthesis in sera and peritoneal exudates. After MHV3 infection, a full resistance of control A/J mice was observed, in contrast to the high mortality rate observed among the depleted animals, where higher virus titers were found in different tissues. The IFN-y synthesis in sera and peritoneal exudates of depleted mice, after MHV3 infection, drastically decreased when compared to that detected in control mice. The data presented are consistent with the hypothesis that IFN-y plays an essential role in the resistance of A/J mice to MHV3 infection.",

These mice have macrophages that are very sensitive to IFN -y in order to develop an anti-MHV3 state and are capable of producing reasonable amounts of IFN-y in the course of the immune response against MHV3. Thus, soon after initiation of infection, the virus particles could be neutralized and the infection cleared in a few days. Alternatively, susceptible BALB/c mice have macrophages that are not sensitive to IFN -y in order to develop an anti-MHV3 state, and despite high concentrations of IFN -y produced during the first days of infection, the macrophages cannot display a restriction of virus multiplication and these animals die 5 to 6 days after infection (6) .",

Since one of the features of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes is to produce and release IFN-y, it was of interest to investigate whether AI] mice treated with monoclonal antibodies against CD4 or CD8 molecules, in such a way that a depletion of CD4 or CD8 T lymphocytes occurred, could be rendered susceptible by an inhibition of IFN-y synthesized during the course of the infection by MHV3.",

The effect was due to the treatment with specific antibodies against IFN-y, CD4 or CD8, since mice treated with normal rat antibodies behave like those only infected with MHV3, showing that nonspecific effects of control antibodies were not involved. The finding that depletion of either CD4 or CD8 T cell subsets showed the same effect on the inhibition of IFN-y synthesis, mainly in the sera, after MHV3 infection is rather surprising and has been one of the subjects of our present investigations.",

The virus titers increased gradually to a peak of 10 4 to 10 5 PFU/ ml or g after 4 to 6 days of infection, when the mice died of acute hepatitis. In control mice, the virus titers increased during the first 2 days of infection and then decreased, with no virus being found after 5 days of infection.Thekinetics of IFN-o./~ and IFN-y synthesis in the serum and peritoneal exudate of control or specific antibody treated AI] mice infected with MHV3 are shown in Figure 2 and 3. It can be seen that the treatment with antibodies against IFN-y, CD4 and CDS cells was able to neutralize or inhibit the synthesis of IFN-y that was observed in control AI] mice during the MHV3 infection. On the other hand, no significant inhibition of IFNo./~ synthesis during the infection was observed in treated mice. The neutralizationl inhibition of IFN -y synthesis observed in the treated AI] mice during the infection, correlated with the lack of resistance showed by these animals to MHV3 infection. ::::::~:~;:::;~~:::;;;i;;::::; 0~~~--~--~--~--5 L-~ t~ ~ ~:::::: :::;~~: ~~:: :::~:;: :::; o~--L---~--~--~--5~~ DAYS DAYS",
