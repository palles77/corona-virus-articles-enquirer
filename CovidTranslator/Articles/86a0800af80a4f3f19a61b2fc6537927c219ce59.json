There are currently no vaccines or small molecule therapeutics available for the treatment or prophylaxis of norovirus infections. Norovirus 3CL protease plays a vital role in viral replication by generating structural and nonstructural proteins via the cleavage of the viral polyprotein. Thus, molecules that inhibit the viral protease may have potential therapeutic value. We describe herein the structure-based design, synthesis, and in vitro and cell-based evaluation of the first class of oxadiazole-based, permeable macrocyclic inhibitors of norovirus 3CL protease.",

            "text": "Human noroviruses belong to the genus Norovirus in the family Caliciviridae. 1 They are the primary cause of sporadic and epidemic nonbacterial gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. [2] [3] [4] [5] Norovirus infection is associated with high morbidity among the elderly and young, as well as immunocompromised patients. 6 The mortality rate among children in developing countries is estimated to exceed 200 000 annually. 7 Of the six norovirus genogroups (GI-VI), GI and GII are associated with human infections, with the GII.4 cluster accounting for 70-80% of norovirus outbreaks worldwide. 8 Devising prophylactic and/or therapeutic interventions for norovirus infection presents a challenge due to the high transmissibility, genetic diversity, environmental stability, and prolonged virus shedding displayed by noroviruses. 9,10 Furthermore, human noroviruses do not robustly grow in cell culture and only low levels of human norovirus are reported to grow in human B cells. 11 Lastly, there is currently no optimal animal model of the disease; consequently, many aspects of norovirus biology and pathogenesis are poorly understood. 12 The norovirus RNA genome (7.4-7.7 kb) is a positive-sense single stranded genome comprising three open reading frames (ORF1-3) of which ORF1 encodes a 200 kDa polyprotein that is proteolytically cleaved to generate at least six nonstructural proteins: p48, RNA helicase/NTPase, p22, VPg, 3C-like protease (3CLpro), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). 1, 13 ORF2 and ORF3 encode the norovirus capsid (VP2) and a small basic protein (VP1), respectively. Processing of the polyprotein is effected by the norovirus 3CLpro, a cysteine protease having a chymotrypsin-like fold, an extended binding cleft, and a Cys-His-Glu catalytic triad. [14] [15] [16] The preferred substrate recognition sequence for 3CLpro is -F/Y-X-L-Q-G/A-corresponding to -P 4 -P 3 -P 2 -P 1 -P 1 \u2032 -, 17 where the P 1 Gln residue determines the primary substrate specificity of the enzyme and X is H, Q, or E. [18] [19] [20] The S 3 subsite displays a degree of plasticity and, therefore, can accommodate a P 3 Gln, His, or Glu. Because processing of the polyprotein by 3CLpro is essential for viral replication, inhibition of 3CLpro is envisaged to be a fruitful avenue of investigation for the discovery of norovirus-specific antivirals, an approach that has been successfully used in the discovery of therapeutics for other viral diseases. 21, 22 We have recently described an array of inhibitors of 3CLpro, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] including the demonstration of in vivo efficacy by a dipeptidyl inhibitor using a murine norovirus model. 28 We report herein the results of structural, biochemical, and antiviral studies of a novel series of oxadiazole-based cell permeable macrocyclic inhibitors (I) (Figure 1 ) of norovirus 3CLpro.",

            "text": "There are several disadvantages associated with peptide-derived drugs, including high conformational flexibility, susceptibility to proteolytic degradation, poor membrane permeability, and low oral bioavail-ability. 29, 30 These shortcomings are frequently mitigated through depeptitization. An effective way of depeptitizing a linear peptide is through macrocyclization. [31] [32] [33] [34] The preorganization and structural rigidity that characterize macrocyclic inhibitors frequently enhance pharmacological activity by reducing the entropic penalty associated with binding and, furthermore, increase proteolytic stability. 34 The effect of macrocyclization on cellular permeability and oral bioavailability is less predictable; however, these parameters are expected to be augmented when a macrocycle can engage in intramolecular hydrogen bonding. 35, 36 On the basis of these considerations, we hypothesized that tethering of the P 1 Gln residue, the preferred primary substrate specificity residue of norovirus 3CLpro, with the P 3 residue side chain in an appropriate linear peptide using a 1,3,4-oxadiazole linker would yield a macrocyclic scaffold (I) (Figure 1 ) potentially capable of participating in intramolecular hydrogen bonding via the ring oxygen or nitrogen atoms, depending on the orientation assumed by the heterocyclic ring. Additional design considerations included ensuring that the ring size of the macrocycle would be optimal in terms of allowing the macrocycle to assume a \u03b2-strand conformation, a structural motif recognized by proteases. 37, 38 This is of paramount importance, since a \u03b2-strand conformation would allow proper docking/positioning of the inhibitor to the active site which, in turn, would orient correctly the side chains of the P 1 and P 2 residues, thereby maximizing hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic binding interactions. Lastly, the length of the linker and the position of the heterocyclic ring were also anticipated to influence permeability and potency by impacting the conformation of the macrocycle (vide infra).",

Fragments 4a-f were synthesized by coupling an appropriate Z-protected carboxylic acid with tert-butyl carbazate using EDCI to yield the Boc-protected hydrazides 1a-e. The Boc protective group was removed via treatment with dry HCl/dioxane, and the resulting hydrazine was coupled to (L)-Boc-glutamic acid \u03b1-methyl ester using EDCI/HOBt/DIEA/DMF to yield hydrazides 2a-f. Reaction with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride/DIEA in dry CH 3 CN yielded 1,3,4-removal of the Boc-group to yield 5, which was then coupled to (L)-Boc-Leu using EDCI/ HOBt/DIEA/DMF to form fragment 6. Coupling of fragments 4a-f and 6 generated leucinesubstituted intermediates 7a-c and 7e (Scheme 2). The corresponding cyclohexylalaninesubstituted compounds 7d and 7f-h were prepared by coupling compounds 4a-f to (L)cyclohexylalanine methyl ester to give esters 13a-d which were hydrolyzed to the corresponding carboxylic acids 14a-d (Scheme 3). Coupling of the acids with (L)-Glu(OBzl) methyl ester yielded compounds 7d and 7f-h. Treatment of compounds 7a-h with H 2 /Pd-C furnished acyclic precursors 8a-h. Subsequent macrolactamization 40 yielded compounds 9a-h which, upon reduction with lithium borohydride, generated the corresponding alcohols 10a-h. Oxidation to aldehydes 15-22 was accomplished using Dess-Martin periodinane, and the synthesized compounds are listed in Table 1 .",

These binding interactions, as well as the flexible backbone of the T123-G133 loop, are postulated to play a critical role in enzyme recognition. 42 The lack of cellular permeability of inhibitor 22 is supported by the absence of any intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the oxadiazole ring; however, permeability involves the interplay of many factors besides intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Notably, interactions between inhibitor 21 and Thr134 were not observed, since the loop of NV 3CLpro spanning Gly133-Pro136 was consistently disordered. Thus, it seems that the macrocycle ring size may play a role in forming optimal hydrogen bond interactions with NV 3CLpro. Surprisingly, decreasing the macrocycle ring from 21 atoms (inhibitor 22) to 20 atoms (inhibitor 21) results in more disorder of the inhibitor and nearby residues of NV 3CLpro. In order to gain insight and understanding into the structural determinants that impact potency and cellular permeability, herculean efforts were expended in obtaining high resolution X-ray crystal structures of permeable inhibitors 18-20, albeit without success. Although crystals were obtained for NV 3CLpro cocrystallized with inhibitors 18-20, these samples only yielded weak X-ray diffraction properties even after optimization of the crystallization conditions. Finally, the crystallographic data indicate that the oxadiazole-based macrocyclic inhibitors weaken all H-bonding prospects for this pharmacophore element.",

            "text": "In an effort to correlate the crystal structures with the data provided in Table 1 , the structures of NV 3CLpro were superimposed using secondary structure matching with GESAMT. 43 Not surprising, the overall structures of the NV 3CLpro were very similar to an rmsd of 0.54 \u00c5 between C\u03b1 atoms (158 residues). In order to conduct a more direct analysis of the inhibitors, the disordered portion of the macrocycle for inhibitor 21 was modeled in an idealized position and compared with inhibitor 22 ( Figure 6 ). Notably, the shorter ring size of inhibitor 21 appears to move the inhibitor slightly away from the loop containing Thr134 which precludes formation of a hydrogen bond and disorder of residues Gly133-Pro136 in the nearby loop. However, inhibitor 22 is able to stabilize this loop region by formation of a hydrogen bond with Thr134 due to the larger ring size. This perhaps explains the observed difference in the IC 50 values (Table 1 ), as inhibitor 22 is able to form an extra hydrogen bond relative to the other inhibitors. Further shortening of the macrocycle ring size (inhibitors 15-20) would likely move the inhibitor further away from Thr134 and prevent formation of hydrogen bonds with the loop and result in disorder of these residues. This may also explain why the crystals obtained with inhibitors 18-20 produced poor diffraction, as the dynamic conformations of the nearby loop could potentially prevent formation of wellordered crystals. Conversely, the shorter macrocycle ring size appears to be more conducive to permeability, although binding to the NV 3CLpro target is slightly weakened.",

            "text": ",28,41Antiviral AssaysEach compound was evaluated for anti-3CLpro effects up to 100 \u03bcM. For the cell based assay, 1 day old HG23 cells (NV replicon harboring cells) were treated with various concentrations (1.0-100 \u03bcM) of each compound and incubated for 48 h. Then total RNA was extracted from cells for qRT-PCR for norovirus and \u03b2-actin. The EC50 and EC 90 (the 50% and 90% inhibitory concentration in cell based assay, respectively) of each compound were calculated by the % reduction of RNA levels to Mock-treated cells after normalization with \u03b2-actin levels. Each compound was also tested against MNV-1. Confluent RAW267.4 was inoculated with MNV-1 at a MOI of 0.05, and at the same time, various concentrations (1.0-100 \u03bcM) of each compound were added to the medium. Virus infected cells were further incubated for 72 h until extensive cytopathic effects (CPE) progress. The EC 50 of each compound was determined by 50% inhibition of CPE progress (cell death) by each compound at 48 h using a CytoTox96 nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cell cytotoxicity for each compound in HG23 cells was also measured by the cytotoxicity assay kit with serial dilution up to 100 \u03bcM. The CC 50 (the 50% cytotoxic concentration) was determined for each compound. The IC 50 , EC 50 , or CC 50 values were determined by at least two independent experiments.X-ray Crystallographic Studies. Crystallization and Data CollectionPurified norovirus 3CL protease (3CLpro) in 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM PBS, pH 7.2, 1 mM DTT at a concentration of 10 mg/mL was used for the preparation of the enzyme:22 complex. Stock solutions of 100 mM 21 and 22 were prepared in DMSO and the 3CLpro:inhibitor complex was prepared by mixing 7 \u03bcL of the inhibitors (3 mM) with 243 \u03bcL (0.49 mM) of 3CLpro and incubating on ice for 1 h. The buffer was exchanged to 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, using a Zeba spin desalting column (MWCO = 7 kDa, Life Technologies), and the sample was concentrated to 10.0 mg/mL for crystallization screening. All crystallization experiments were conducted using a Compact Jr. (Rigaku Reagents) sitting drop vapor diffusion plates at 20 \u00b0C and equal volumes of protein and crystallization solution equilibrated against 75 \u03bcL of the latter. Crystals were obtained from the from the Index HT screen (Hampton Research). Prismatic crystals of NV 3CLpro:21 were obtained in 2 days from condition E9 (30% v/v pentaerythritol ethoxylate (15/4 EO/OH), 50 mM Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 50 mM ammonium sulfate). Crystals of NV 3CLpro:22 displaying a needle morphology were obtained in 2-3 days condition H12 (30% (w/v) PEG 2000 MME, 150 mM potassium bromide). Samples were cryoprotected in a fresh drop crystallant for NV 3CLpro:21 and 80% crystallization solution/20% glycerol for NV 3CLpro:22, before storing in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source beamline 17-ID using a Dectris Pilatus 6M pixel array detector.",
