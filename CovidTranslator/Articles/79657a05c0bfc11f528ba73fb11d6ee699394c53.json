Signaling from TLRs leads to upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules for better priming of T cells and secretion of inflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells 1-4 . Lymphocytedeficient hosts often die of acute infection, presumably owing to their lack of an adaptive immune response to effectively clear pathogens. However, we show here that an unleashed innate immune response due to the absence of residential T cells can also be a direct cause of death. Viral infection or administration of poly(I:C), a ligand for TLR3, led to cytokine storm in T-cell-or lymphocyte-deficient mice in a fashion dependent on NK cells and tumor necrosis factor. We have further shown, through the depletion of CD4 + and CD8 + cells in wild-type mice and the transfer of T lymphocytes into Rag-1-deficient mice, respectively, that T cells are both necessary and sufficient to temper the early innate response. In addition to the effects of natural regulatory T cells, close contact of resting CD4 + CD25 \u2212 Foxp3 \u2212 or CD8 + T cells with innate cells could also suppress the cytokine surge by various innate cells in an antigen-independent fashion. Therefore, adaptive immune cells have an unexpected role in tempering initial innate responses.",

            "text": "To study the early innate response, we infected nude mice and wild-type mice with MHV-A59, a coronavirus that primarily infects mouse liver and brain 5,6 . Nude mice died at a sublethal dose of virus as compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 1a) . We presumed that lack of T cells might permit vigorous progression of the viral infection, enough to kill the host. To our surprise, the virus titer in the liver was not significantly higher in nude mice than in wild-type mice (Fig.  1b) . To determine the cause of death, we collected liver and brain tissues and assessed them by H&E staining, but we did not observe any major pathology (data not shown). As a functional readout for organ damage after infection, we measured the concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), but we detected only mild increases in nude mice as compared to wild-type mice, insufficient to explain the elevated death rate of the former (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). This raised the intriguing possibility that the immunocompromised mice might actually die due to cytokine storm. To test that, the sera of mice were collected and cytokine levels were determined on days 2 and 4. Higher abundances of proinflammatory cytokines were detected in T cell-deficient mice than in wild-type mice (n = 16) on both day 2 ( Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2 ) and day 4 (data not shown).",

            "text": "MHV-A59 is an RNA virus that can target TLR3, and RNA virus-related poly(I:C) is a noninfectious ligand for TLR3 (ref. 7) . To analyze susceptibility to TLR3 stimulation independent of infectious particles, we used the poly(I:C) compound to ensure that both wildtype and immunocompromised mice were exposed to similar levels of TLR3 stimulation. Notably, all nude mice rapidly died in 12-24 h after receiving a sublethal dose of poly(I:C) (Fig. 2a) . As seen in MHV-A59 infection, various proinflammatory cytokine levels were much higher in nude mice than wild-type mice at 2 and 6 h after treatment ( Fig. 2b and Supplementary  Fig. 3a) . It is likely that this rapid death of the mice could be attributable to cytokine storm, similar to that caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or superantigens [8] [9] [10] . To study whether other immunocompromised mice have similar sensitivity to poly(I:C), we used Rag-1 knockout mice, which lack functional lymphocytes. Like nude mice, Rag-1 knockout mice also showed hypersensitivity to poly(I:C) and died within 12-24 h after treatment with a sublethal dose of the compound (Fig. 2c) . Again, cytokine levels were much higher in the Rag-1 knockout mice than in wild-type mice ( Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 3b ). To further determine whether T cells are essential to control the early innate response, we depleted wild-type mice with antibodies to CD4 and CD8 before poly(I:C) treatment, and found that the depleted mice produced more inflammatory cytokines than the control mice (Fig. 2e) . To assess whether T cells are sufficient to control the overzealous cytokine response, we adoptively transferred lymphocytes to Rag-1 knockout mice, and after 2 d treated them with poly(I:C). The reconstituted mice produced lower levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in 2 h, and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 in 6 h, than control mice (Fig. 2f) . It is possible that low-grade infection in these immunodeficient mice might cause more activation of innate cells. To examine whether T cells are sufficient to temper the initial cytokine surge of innate cells from the same source, we divided splenocytes from wild-type mice into non-T and T cell populations. Non-T cells in culture responded vigorously to MHV-A59 or poly(I:C) to produce high levels of cytokines, whereas T cells did not. Notably, addition of T cells to non-T cells efficiently prevented this cytokine surge ( Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 4 ). This suggests that constant monitoring by T cells is required to temper the innate response. To further test which subset of T cells is more important, we separated T cells into CD4 + and CD8 + populations. When either population of T cells was mixed with non-T cells, cytokine production was reduced (Fig. 3b ).",

Either cellular population could control the cytokine surge, suggesting that the tempering of the innate response is likely to be antigen independent. Because cell-cell contact could still be important in this process, we used a Transwell system, with non-T cells stimulated with poly(I:C) in the lower well and T cells in the upper well, and found that the inhibitory effect was greatly reduced (Fig. 3d) . Therefore, T cell-mediated inhibition of the innate response is dependent on cell-cell contact. To determine whether contact-dependent functions of T cells are mediated by TCR-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) recognition, CD4 + cells were added into non-T cells from MHC class II knockout mice and the cells were stimulated with poly(I:C) overnight. These class II-deficient non-T cells were only weakly inhibited by CD4 + T cells, whereas CD4 + T cells from the same source robustly inhibited wild-type non-T cells ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). The impaired inhibition of class IIdeficient non-T cells by CD4 + cells is consistent with the similarly weak inhibition seen in the Transwell study. Therefore, the inhibition by T cells is mainly mediated by cell-cell contact and is MHC dependent.",

The Treg-depleted T cell population still efficiently inhibited the cytokine surge, much as the whole population of T cells did. Next, we tested the effect of depleting Foxp3 + cells by using FoxP3(GFP) knock-in mice 13 , whose Foxp3 + cells have bright green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence and can be readily removed by sorting. We isolated GFP-negative (non-Treg) T cells and GFP-positive (Treg) T cells from the FoxP3(GFP) knockin mice and found that both populations were capable of inhibiting innate responses (Fig. 3f) .

To further refine our understanding of the cellular mechanism of T cell mediated inhibition of the innate response, we stimulated innate cells with poly(I:C) and analyzed cytokine production by NK1.1 + , CD11b + or CD11c + cells, with or without T cells. The presence of co-cultured T cells led to a decrease in TNF production by CD11b + or CD11c + cells and decreased IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells after poly(I:C) stimulation (Fig. 4a) . To determine which cells are sufficient to respond to poly(I:C), we further separated non-T cells into CD11b + and NK 1.1 + cell populations and stimulated them with poly(I:C). Upon direct stimulation, CD11b + cells produced TNF, but NK cells alone did not produce IFN-\u03b3. Furthermore, the addition of NK cells to the CD11b + culture enhanced TNF production, suggesting that once NK cells are activated, they can in turn further activate CD11b + cells in a positive feedback loop. Under these conditions, the addition of T cells attenuated the production of TNF and IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 4b) . Therefore, it is likely that poly(I:C) stimulates CD11b + and CD11c + cells, which subsequently stimulate NK cells; T cells primarily inhibit antigen-presenting cells, which then block the positive loop of NK-cell activation.",

TNF seems to be more essential for cytokine-induced death, as TNFR-hIg treatment rescued these mice, whereas anti-IFN-\u03b3 did not protect them (Fig. 4c-e and Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Because NK cells can enhance TNF production by innate cells, we sought to determine the necessity of NK cells in the poly(I:C) response. Rag-1 knockout mice were treated with anti-NK1.1 or anti-asialo-GM-1 antibodies before poly(I:C) injection. After NK-cell depletion, the survival rate of Rag-1 knockout mice was increased to 72%, and their levels of proinflammatory cytokines were corresponding lower (Fig. 4f,g) . TNF and NK cells seem to have essential roles in poly(I:C)-induced sudden death of Rag-1 knockout mice. To test whether T cells also inhibit other TLR-mediated stimulation on innate cells, we stimulated non-T cells with LPS, a potent stimulator of TLR4, and determined their cytokine levels. Cytokine production by non-T cells was also controlled by addition of T cells (Supplementary Fig. 7) . Therefore, T cells control innate cells under various conditions.",

The unrestrained innate immune response itself, owing to the lack of supervision by T cells, can be the direct cause of death from acute infection. In addition to natural regulatory T cells, large numbers of naive T cells might be needed to efficiently temper the deadly TLR response at the initial phase of infection. These studies confirm our hypothesis that the adaptive immune system suppresses the innate system in the early phase of viral and nonviral challenges and that lack of T cells might result in excessive innate responses to TLR stimulation. The concept of an unleashed innate response in the absence of adaptive modulation may also lead to new diagnosis and treatment for individuals with congenital or acquired immune deficiency.",
