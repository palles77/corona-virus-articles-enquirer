Over the past few decades, Japanese immunologists have been involved in many important discoveries at the forefront of immunological research, yet, when it comes to the translation of new discoveries into clinical innovations and new therapies, Japan's track record seems more modest.",

Even though the new approaches of 'evidence-based medicine' and 'translational research' have also arrived in Japan, a recent study indicates that whereas research output in the biomedical sciences in Japan has increased considerably over the past two decades, the same is not true in many clinical fields 2 . For example, a literature study finds evidence for only one randomized, controlled trial in the field infectious diseases in Japan between 1991 and 2000 (REF. 3 ). Although this might understate the reality, it is true that the proportion of case-controlled and cohort studies from Japan is indeed smaller than from other countries.",

With the increasing resistance to antibiotics, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and West Nile Virus, we have been reminded that the eradication of infectious disease is unlikely to occur. At the same time, the prevalence of allergies has been rising rapidly in many industrialized countries.

In Japan's cooperative regulatory system, regulatory decision making is highly dependent on the relationship between ministries and their 'clients' in industry or the general public 10 . For the health ministry, the JMAa powerful lobby group with tight connections with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) -remains perhaps its most important client. The JMA has repeatedly taken the position that there can be no separation between medical therapy and medical research, and that any kind of activity carried out with the eventual goal of helping patients should be labelled as medical, rather than as research. The JMA has also taken an increasingly aggressive stance towards privacy protection in medical research 11 . One practical implication of such Although the focus at the RCAI is on basic research, its political patrons have also bestowed a more practical mission on the centre -to contribute actively to the development of new therapies for common allergic conditions, such as Japanese cedar pollen allergy 5 . In some sense, the RCAI is an exemplary case. After two decades of unprecedented growth in research funding for life sciences, today, scientists in Japan are increasingly asked to deliver research results that are socially 'relevant' and the time seems ripe to initiate a debate on how to better link biological research to clinical applications.",

Here , I argue that the lack of cooperation between scientists, who work in basic research, and clinicians is largely the result of the reaction to a given set of incentives and circumstances, rather than a conscious choice. For scientists working towards a professorship and a research career at a large national university, there are few real incentives to engage in translational research, whereas for clinicians, to engage in clinical research at the 'cutting edge' of science typically means little more than inflated risks without much prospect for additional merits. Yet, over the next few years, to engage more aggressively in translational research could turn out to be crucial for basic immunologists in Japan to maintain funding and perhaps also research productivity.",

Bloom argued in this year's presidential address at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the United States healthcare system seems ill-prepared to reap the benefits of the present advances in biological research 6 . The same is true with respect to Japan. As a former health ministry official observed in a comparative study on medical research policy published in the early 1990s, the health-care policy in Japan has never been integrated with science policy 7 . Despite a number of changes, numerous reports and policy documents, this remains true today. There are several reasons for this fact. First, research has not been high on the agenda of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), which also manages Japan's national health insurance and pension systems -two of the largest budget items for the government. The MHLW also regulates drug approval and decides prizes for new pharmaceuticals; however, research is at best a minor occupation for the ministry. In fact, there are numerous cases in which health ministry officials have actively opposed more aggressive moves by other ministries to support innovation in medical science and technology 8 .",

Although rising healthcare costs in Japan are as much an issue of debate as elsewhere, it remains a fact that at barely 8% of gross domestic product (GDP), Japan spends much less on healthcare than most other Organization for Economics Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries -and so has less to spend on clinical research 9 .

The highly hierarchical structures that are still prevalent in medical research, in some cases, further impede innovative research 13 .

However, as the violent clashes over genetically modified organisms in Europe remind us, regulations can be important tools for building public confidence in science 18 . In contrast to the arcane rules and regulations that have governed technology transfer practices in Japan, there have been relatively few attempts, so far, to regulate the content of research. Instead, the regulation of biomedical research in Japan has followed a rather cautious path and, if anything, regulators have tended to favour permissiveness rather than restriction. Perhaps the only real exception is a somewhat unusual bill that outlaws human cloning, eventually introduced in 2001, and that some scientists would prefer to see revised and replaced by more flexible regulations 19 .",

In controversial areas of research, such as xenotransplantation, the health ministry has simply postponed decisions, or in effect delegated them to Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), knowing that university IRBs are incapable of handling a complex regulatory decision such as the safety of xenotransplantation. The outcome has been that, while not forbidden, clinical trials with xenotransplantation seem highly unlikely in Japan until the ministry drafts some sort of safety guidelines. A negligent approach to bioethics rules can backfire too, and the introduction of the principle of informed consent is a typical example 20 . It was only after the international harmonization of pharmaceutical approval procedures that informed consent practices became enforced in Japan, in 1996. The effects were predictable. During the 1990s, enrolment in clinical trials in Japan declined steadily. In fact, in areas where regulation remains unclear, such as the harvesting of human cells and tissues for research use, the result has often been paralysis rather than 'anything goes' 21 .",

In the case of immunobiology, scientists in Japan have shown considerable achievements in basic science, yet efforts to translate these findings into therapeutic innovations seem to have been much less prevalent, let alone fruitful. If leading immunologists in Japan have not chosen to pursue clinical development more aggressively, this can be explained by several external factors including; the organization of medical research in academia; research policy and research funding practices; a clinical environment that is hostile to therapeutic innovation; a peculiar technology transfer regime; regulatory uncertainty, as well as a lack of expression of society demands on research. What is needed is not only a better physical infrastructure for biomedical research, as opposed to biological or medical research and clinical studies, but also more marked changes in Japan's research funding regime and in Japanese academic institutions to provide scientists with the right incentives to engage in clinical and translational research activities.",

The name of the institute and its affiliation with Japan's foremost basic research organization are indicative of a political compromise; scientists behind the centre, as well as its main advisor, Kimishige Ishizaka, had stressed the importance of funding curiosity-driven basic research. However, some of the centre's political patrons saw it more as a step towards accomplishing their political crusade to overcome pollinosis and other allergies. The result of this compromise is a mix of unconditional support for basic science and efforts to accelerate the pace of discovery and innovation through common facilities, and a focus on research technologies to facilitate the transfer of new findings to the clinic. A major research focus of the centre is on regulatory lymphocytes and other cells with regulatory functions, such as natural killer T (NKT) cells 27 , regulatory T cells 28 or regulatory dendritic cells (DCs) 29 . The centre also supports research on developmental immunobiology 30,31 , cell signalling 32 and autoimmune diseases 33 . Laboratories directed by younger investigators are specializing in various topics, including the role of impaired phagocytosis in inflammatory disorders or autoimmune diseases 34 , the role of IgA in mucosal homeostasis 35 , regulation of the T helper 1 (T H 1)/T H 2-cell balance by DCs, the link between innate and adaptive immunity 36 , cytokine signalling that controls the T H 2/IgE balance 37 and chaperones involved in antigen processing-degradation pathways. These research activities are supported by groups that specialize in developmental genetics and techniques for embryo manipulation, genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics, forward-genetic approaches, single-molecule studies and nano-imaging (FIG 2). Programmes on fundamental research technologies are undertaken in cooperation with other organizations -such as the Kazusa DNA Research Institute or the RIKEN Genomic Sciences Centre -and various public hospitals. More applied topics studied at the centre include the mechanisms that control T-cell activation in immune dysfunctions, elucidation of the mast-cell transcriptome and strategies to combat Japanese cedar pollen allergens.",
