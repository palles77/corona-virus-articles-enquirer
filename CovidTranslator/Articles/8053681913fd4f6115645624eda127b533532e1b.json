            "text": "Effective interventions to interrupt transmission of infection in hospitals should be based on knowledge of the relevant transmission mechanisms involved. Unfortunately there is a lack of evidence-based knowledge of such transmission mechanisms, with much \"fact\" established by retrospective observation and anecdote. Most infections will have multiple routes of potential transmission and some will have an airborne route as one of those routes of transmission. A true airborne route (i.e. solely transmission by a particle so small that it has neutral buoyant density and will remain airborne for long periods) is currently thought to be rare. Aspergillus spp. constitute one group of pathogens thought to be transmitted primarily by aerosols and are present in the hospital environment. 1 However, most pathogens will be transferred by direct or indirect contact, or by larger temporarily airborne particles (>10 mm \"droplets\") that will fall to the ground within 2 metres of their point of generation. 2 The acute hospital environment Infection control teams (ICTs) should be consulted for their input on any building project in a hospital [www.pef.scot.nhs.uk/guest/SHFN30/ SHFN30V2.pdf]. When building isolation rooms, the ICT's input should be to provide specifications of isolation rooms together with the estimated number of rooms required by defining indications of use, and infection hazards, such as the aspergillus risk to highly immunocompromised patients, from the building work itself. [3] [4] [5] [6] In construction projects, experience shows it is important for the ICTs to work together with both the project team (e.g. an independent commercial contractor) and the management of each individual unit.",

For example, these include increased distances between beds due to the requirements for patient hoists, an increase in the proportion of beds in single rooms as well as the proportion of single rooms with en suite toilets and showers, and a decrease in the numbers of beds in bays. All these improvements are due to the requirements for patient safety, such as nosocomial infections, and patient comfort and privacy during their hospital stay.",

            "text": "The isolation of patients is not an abrupt jump from no isolation to full isolation. There is an incremental process from a basic set of infection control measures (general or standard precautions) meant to prevent dispersion or acquisition of unknown infectious agents, through to increased precautions on the ward as infection or colonisation becomes known or suspected (particularly if there are no single rooms available). In addition there is cohorting on wards or in bays, to the use of nonspecialist single rooms (preferably with their own toilet and bathing facilities) and finally the use of specially-engineered isolation rooms if there is an airborne element to transmission. 7 Interest in the use of airborne isolation rooms has increased due to the occurrence of new emerging diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 8 avian influenza 9 and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). 10 The recognition of the possibility of pandemic outbreaks of influenza has required authorities to put in place \"emergency planning\" for dealing with infected patients that may require isolation, 10, 11 although with influenza, airborne isolation is not thought to be an issue unless specific \"aerosol-generating procedures\" are occurring such as bronchoscopy or sputum induction. Isolation rooms can be used to constrain the spread of small-particle aerosols, which some evidence suggests may play a role in all these diseases. 12 In order to maximise the use of such specialist facilities there can be financial issues for these rooms to be multifunctional, i.e. to be used as non-specific pressure (low risk normal use), negative pressure (protection of healthcare workers and visitors in the room, and healthcare workers and patients outside the room) or positive pressure (highly immuno-compromised patient protection from inhalation of fungal spores if the incoming air is filtered by a \"High Efficiency Particulate Air\" filter [HEPA-filtered]). Isolation rooms which can be switched from one functional type to another such as changing a positive-pressure room into a negative-pressure room are highly hazardous and should be avoided due to the possibility of use at the incorrect pressure regime. If multifunctional facilities are to be used staff must be trained correctly, rooms must have written operating and auditing procedures, and in addition electronic warning systems and alerts must be in place.",

The US Department of the Army 21 specifies an exhaust flow of 20% greater than supply for their isolation rooms. Both CDC and the UK recommend the use of alarmed pressure devices to provide continuous monitoring of the negative pressure. 18 However, infection control considerations only require that the air flows inwards through gaps in the room's fabric (hence \"negative pressure\"). The value of this pressure, given a robust difference between extract and supply rates, is irrelevant. However, the number of air changes per hour should be calculated as this allows the time in which the air is \"cleaned\" from a pathogen to be calculated.",

The value of such pressure is relatively unimportant as long as the direction of airflow it signifies is clearly indicated. This should be monitored in such a way that the users of the ward are instantly aware of any failure. However, remote building management systems (BMS) may cause a considerable delay in ward staff becoming aware of a system failure. Any system must measure the desired parameter (negative pressure) directly or it is prone to failure. Hoffman et al. in 2004 24 reported an unnoticed failure where the fans in an air-handling unit were monitored and working but an inadvertently closed ductwork damper prevented any actual extract airflow, resulting in a \"negative-pressure\" room being at positive pressure although the BMS did not indicate the failure. This demonstrates that dampers and pressure stabilisers have a role in generating flow stability and also provide a visual indication (as the damper moves in a particular direction) that air is flowing in the intended direction.",

[31] [32] [33] This technique has been used to assess the effectiveness of containment laboratories and is measured in terms of the laboratory protection factor (LPF), which is the ratio of KI particles generated within the laboratory to those detected outside the laboratory. The same technique has been used to measure the performance and operator protection factor (OPF) of microbiological safety cabinets where a protection factor of 10 5 is regarded as being adequate. 17 BL-3 laboratories without an anteroom were found to provide an LPF of approximately 10 4 whilst the provision of an anteroom increased the LPF approximately tenfold. There was no direct relationship between the magnitude of negative pressure and LPF. However, the authors did find a direct relationship between the in-flow velocity and LPF. In terms of flow, a volumetric in-flow of 10 m 3 /min into a laboratory through an anteroom gave an LPF of greater than 10 5 . The significant findings of the study are that the LPF, a measure of containment, is dependent on the laboratory in-flow and of the magnitude of the pressure differential. 30 Since negative-pressure rooms are normally designed only on the basis of the pressure-differential magnitude, this finding has major implications for the design of containment laboratories and isolation rooms.",

In such circumstances single rooms may add an element of quality assurance to staff behaviour. 38, 39 However, there are patients with profound or prolonged neutropenia, typically bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients, to whom inhalation of fungal spores presents a risk of infection. 40, 41 Fungal spores generally originate outside the hospital and will be part of the hospital air, as this air is not filtered. In particular, their aerosolisation may be associated with demolition or renovation/construction work. 42, 43 They can also originate inside the hospital but this requires prolonged damp conditions in the patient's proximity or renovation/construction work. 44 In addition to the prevention of infection by direct and indirect contact, it has to be ensured that all the air available for these patients to breath has had the fungal spores filtered from it. This is done by supplying air filtered by HEPA filters that can remove fungal spores with very high efficiency to the patient's environment and ensuring that this is the only air available for them to breath. 1, 45 As there will inevitably be gaps in the patient's room, for example via cable and pipe entry points and around the door, if the room is at positive pressure, the clean air leaking outwards will prevent unfiltered air from leaking inwards. These areas cannot have opening windows. This type of isolation is generally known as \"positive pressure\", but the filtration of the air is more important; positive pressure by itself will not achieve safety.
