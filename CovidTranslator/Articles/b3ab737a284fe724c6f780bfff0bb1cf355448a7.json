Three of these 22 sense mutations resided in VP0, 6 exists in VP1, one exists in VP3, 3 exists in 2A2, 3 exists in 2C, one was detected in 3B and 5 was in 3D. These results suggested that VP0, VP1, 3D, and 5 0 /3 0 UTR may contribute to the attenuation of DHV-1 in chicken/ duck/embryos.

            "text": "Duck hepatitis virus type 1 (DHV-1) was first described on Long Island in 1949 [1] . Subsequently, outbreaks were reported from England, Canada, Germany, Japan and elsewhere. In 1963, the virus reached the mainland of China, although it was not identified until 1984. DHV-1 causes a highly contagious disease in young ducks often associated with liver necrosis, hemorrhagic, and high mortality, so it was thought as one of the most important viral disease for ducks industry, which is an important part of the animal husbandry in Asia. Currently, control of the disease is based upon the use of modified live virus (MLV) vaccines, which was attenuated through series passage in duck/chicken embryo [2] . But the attenuated mechanism is still not clear. Clues to the genetic basis of pathogenicity can be gleaned from comparison of the nucleotide sequence of a virulent parent viral strain with that of the duck/chicken embryos-passaged attenuated variant. One such pair is the prototype south-east of China isolate, strain SY5, and ZJ-A, its chicken embryos adapted attenuated descendent. In this article, we report the complete nucleotide sequence of both strains of DHV-1 and have deduced and characterized their nucleotide and protein differences. Several key amino acid changes between parental and vaccine strains were identified using this approach, but many other nucleotide and amino acid changes also occurred in genomic regions of unknown function. The nucleotide sequences were also compared to other attenuated DHV-1 strains, and some consistent difference was found in these reference strains, indicating that these amino acids may be related isolate attenuation.",

Genomic RNA was extracted from the viral suspension with RNeasy (Qiagen, Germany), and used immediately for cDNA synthesis. cDNA synthesis was performed with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (RT) (Invitrogen) and specific RT primers. To determine the complete sequences of SY5 and ZJ-A, a total of five fragments covering the complete genome were PCR amplified with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene) and using specific primers (Table S1 ) at several positions along the template RNA based on the published DHV-I sequence.

The nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities between SY5 and ZJ-A were 91.3 and 95 %, respectively. VP1 has been showed to be a very important protein in picornaviruses as it is responsible for attachment to the host cell and contains the primary neutralization epitope. On the other hand, its diversity among isolates is usually high and it seems probable that its variation is linked to host adaptation. Here, our results suggest that there was strong evidence for systematic differences between the field isolates (including SY5) and those that had become tissue-adapted (including ZJ-A). In particular, sequence alignments demonstrate two amino acid substitutions (E 129 ? V 129 and A 142 ? S 142 ) between SY isolates and ZJ-A. The carboxyl terminal region was generally the most variable and here the four attenuated Chinese isolates of group S1 showed six consistent differences from the field isolates (S 181 ? L 181 , H 183 K 184 ? R 183 G 1841 , N 193 ? D 193 , E 205 ? K 205 , R 217 ? K 217 , N 235 ? D 235 ) (Table1). These data strongly suggests that ZJ-A has adapted to tissue culture and was attenuated.

There were seven mutations occurred in the 5 0 -end of the DHV-1 during attenuation of strain SY-5 to ZJ-A, and their relative roles in attenuation must be further investigated. Though there were two changes occurred in the 3 0 -end of the DHV-1 genome, these mutations were also found in other attenuated DHV-1 isolates (data not shown); therefore, we think that they may be also related to the virulence of DHV-1. Viruses may also acquire attenuated phenotypes as a result of mutations in viral proteases, protease cleavage sites, within the polymerase gene, by altering viral proteins to decrease virion stability or to interfere with the virushost interaction, as well as by other mechanisms. The comparison of SY5 to its vaccine correlate, ZJ-A, revealed that the possibility exists for one or more of these mechanisms to be involved in attenuation, especially in 2A2, 2C, and 3D, because we found some consistent mutations among these proteases, which were also exist in other vaccine strains of DHV-1(data not shown).",
