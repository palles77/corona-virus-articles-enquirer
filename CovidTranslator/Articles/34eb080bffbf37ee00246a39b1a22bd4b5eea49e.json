Ribosome biogenesis is overactivated in p53-inactivated cancer cells, although involvement of p53 on ribosome quality is unknown. Here, we show that p53 represses expression of the rRNA methyl-transferase fibrillarin (FBL) by binding directly to FBL. High levels of FBL are accompanied by modifications of the rRNA methylation pattern, impairment of translational fidelity, and an increase of internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation initiation of key cancer genes. FBL overexpression contributes to tumorigenesis and is associated with poor survival in patients with breast cancer. Thus, p53 acts as a safeguard of protein synthesis by regulating FBL and the subsequent quality and intrinsic activity of ribosomes.",

            "text": "FBL Expression Is Inversely Associated with p53 Activity in Cell Lines and Human Breast Cancer Samples Fibrillarin (FBL) is an indispensable, highly conserved protein essential in the processing of pre-rRNAs (Newton et al., 2003; Tollervey et al., 1993) . In eukaryotes, it is the only known methyltransferase that performs the specific 2 0 -O-ribose-methylation directed by a large family of small trans-acting guide RNA (box C/D antisense snoRNAs). Because abnormal rRNA methylation could influence translational control and because p53 regulates rRNA transcription, we explored whether FBL expression was associated with p53 activity. We measured FBL mRNA and protein levels in different cell lines in which p53 expression and/or activity was modulated by different strategies. In immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HME), p53 activity was impaired either by reducing its expression using an shRNA approach (HME-shp53) or by inactivation using an SV40 T/t antigen trapping strategy (HMLE; Elenbaas et al., 2001) . In response to p53 knockdown or inactivation, there was a significant increase in FBL expression: 1.5-fold for the mRNA and 2-fold for the protein (Figures 1A-1D ; Figures S1A and S1B available online). As expected, we observed a decrease in the expression of CDKN1A, which encodes p21, and MDM2, two p53 target genes, which validated the reduction in p53 activity in these cellular models ( Figures 1B, 1D , S1A, and S1B). The inverse correlation between FBL and p53 expression was confirmed in a second series of immortalized HMEC lines (Figures S1C and S1D) and in an isogenic human HCT-116 colorectal cellular model: HCT-116-p53 +/+ cells that express wildtype p53 protein and HCT-116-p53 \u00c0/\u00c0 cells that lack p53 protein expression (Bunz et al., 1998) . FBL mRNA and protein levels were increased in HCT-116-p53 \u00c0/\u00c0 cells compared to those of HCT-116-p53 +/+ cells ( Figures 1E, 1F , and S1E), demonstrating that the increase in expression of FBL in response to p53 inactivation is not restricted to mammary cell lines.",

In this condition, increased FBL expression at the mRNA and protein levels correlated with the inhibition of p53 expression (Figures 2A and 2B ). Taken together, these results exclude the possibility that the changes in FBL expression levels resulted from an off-target effect and firmly link FBL expression to p53 expression. Additionally, to investigate the impact of p53 activation on FBL expression, we treated HME cells with the topoisomerase inhibitors doxorubicin and camptothecin, which are prominent activators of p53. The results showed that the expected p53 induction in response to treatment was accompanied by a decrease in FBL mRNA and protein levels ( Figures 2C and 2D) . Quantification of the western blots demonstrated a significant association between the increase of p53 protein levels and the decrease of FBL protein levels ( Figures S2C-S2E) . The expression of endogenous FBL in the indicated cell lines was analyzed at the mRNA level by RT-qPCR (A, C, and E) and at the protein level by western blot (B, D, and F).

To determine whether FBL expression is associated with p53 mutation status independently of other genetic variations in cell lines, we analyzed the FBL expression levels in a panel of three wild-type p53 breast cell lines and five mutant p53 breast cancer cell lines. High levels of FBL mRNA and protein were significantly associated with the expression of mutant p53 (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3) . This result prompted us to investigate the clinical correlation between the p53 mutation status and FBL expression. We analyzed the FBL mRNA expression levels by RT-qPCR in relation to the p53 mutation status in a cohort of 80 randomly selected primary breast tumors (Table S1 ). Consistent with the results obtained in cell lines, FBL mRNA levels were significantly higher in mutant p53 tumors compared to wild-type p53 tumors ( Figure 3C ). We also performed a retrospective statistical analysis of the gene expression array data described by Miller and colleagues (Miller et al., 2005) . FBL mRNA levels were significantly higher in mutant p53 tumors (n = 58) than in wild-type p53 tumors (n = 193; p < 10 \u00c04 , t test). Altogether, these results show a significant and reproducible inverse association between the p53 level and/or activity and the expression of FBL at both the mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that p53 can repress FBL expression in cellular models of breast and colon cancer as well as in human breast tumors.",

Based on these predictions, we developed a luciferase reporter (pFBL-Luc) assay to assess whether p53 regulates FBL promoter activity. HCT-116-p53 \u00c0/\u00c0 cells were cotransfected with pFBL-Luc and a plasmid expressing either wild-type or mutant p53 protein at Endogenous FBL expression was analyzed in HME cells at the mRNA level by RT-qPCR (A and C) and at the protein level by western blot (B and D) . The p53 expression is modulated by using an siRNA (A and B) or by treating or not (NT) with 2 mg/ml doxorubicin or 1 nM camptothecin (C and D). The p21 lanes in (D) were spliced together from discontinuous lanes of the same blot as indicated by dotted lines.

The coexpression of wild-type p53 significantly decreased the luciferase activity by 80%, while no significant variation in luciferase activity was observed after co-expression of any p53 mutant. Similar results were observed in HME-shp53, the coexpression of wild-type, but not mutant, p53 protein reducing the luciferase activity ( Figure 4C ). These results suggest that p53 represses promoter activity through intron 1 of FBL in both breast and colon cellular models.",

We analyzed the change of rRNA methylation at 18 sites distributed along the 5.8S, 18S, and 28S rRNAs that are known to be methylated. These sites include those localized within key functional domains of rRNAs, i.e., the decoding center (DC) in the 18S rRNA, and the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) and the helix 69 (H69) of 28S rRNA. In general, most of the sites were significantly more frequently methylated in HME-shp53 than in HME cells ( Figures  5A and S5A ). This overall increase in the site-specific rRNA methylation pattern is consistent with our finding that FBL expression level is higher in HME-shp53 than in HME cells, and suggests that methylation could be regulated in a site-by-site manner.",

This showed that the amount and/or activity of the rRNA methylation machinery was sufficient to sustain the global rRNA methylation rate following the increase in rRNA synthesis after p53 inactivation. In addition, because selection of site methylation is ensured by guide C/D-box snoRNAs that complex with FBL, we verified whether snoRNA expression levels were altered in p53-inactivated cells. Northern blot analyses revealed a modification of snoRNA levels according to p53 levels, suggesting that p53 could also be involved in the regulation of some C/D-box snoRNA as is the case for some H/ACA snoRNP (Figures S5D-S5F; Krastev et al., 2011) .

We first analyzed two different examples of translational fidelity, nonsense suppression and amino acid misincorporation (Belin et al., 2009) . The bypass of a premature stop-codon (Figures 5B-5D) and the misincorporation of amino acids (Figures 5E-5G) were both significantly increased after p53 inhibition or inactivation in different cell lines. This suggested that the translational alteration could be due to p53-mediated increase of FBL expression level. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed the misincorporation of amino acids in response to knockdown of FBL expression. As shown in Figure 5G , reduction of FBL expression in HCT-116-p53 \u00c0/\u00c0 prevented the increase in amino acids misincorporation, demonstrating that the decrease in translational quality control in response to p53 inhibition is dependent on FBL overexpression. In contrast, the ability of ribosomes to induce a \u00c01 frameshift from a severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-1 programmed ribosome frameshift signal was similar in the three cell lines (Figures 5H-5J ). These results suggest that p53 inactivation could decrease translational fidelity in an FBL-dependent manner. (B) Quantification of FBL protein expression analyzed by western blot.

At this stage of the study, we focused our analysis on IGF1R due to its role in tumorigenesis and because IGF1R possesses the longest GC-rich 5 0 UTR that contains a well-identified IRES among all human transcripts yet characterized (Giraud et al., 2001; Pollak et al., 2004) . Using a bi-cistronic luciferase assay, we observed a significant increase in the global luciferase activity in the p53-inactivated HME-shp53 and HCT-116-p53 \u00c0/\u00c0 cells compared with cells expressing wild-type p53 ( Figure 6A ). This increase was due to a preference to initiate IRES-dependent translation. Indeed, the translation of the firefly luciferase driven by the IRES of IGF1R was significantly increased, while no significant variation was detected for the renilla luciferase driven by a CAP-dependent mechanism ( Figures S6A and S6B) . Similar results were obtained in other HME-derived cell lines (Figures 6B, white bars; Figures S6C and S6D , sc bars). Moreover, HME and HMLE cells expressed similar levels of firefly luciferase mRNA and renilla luciferase mRNA independently of variations in p53 protein levels, which supports the hypothesis of IRES-mediated translational regulation rather than transcriptional regulation of IGF1R expression ( Figure S6E ).

The polysomal fraction corresponds to mRNA bound to more than one ribosome and therefore contains actively translated mRNA. As shown in Figure 6D , a significant 12-fold polysomal enrichment in IGF1R mRNA was observed in HME-shp53 compared with HME cells. In addition, a significant increase in the IGF1R protein level was observed in p53-inactivated HMLE cells compared to HME cells independently of any variation in IGF1R mRNA levels ( Figures To investigate whether this p53-mediated translational control is restricted to IGF1R mRNA, we analyzed translational control of several other known cellular and viral mRNAs containing IRESs, including MYC, FGF1, FGF2, and VEGFA that play key roles in oncogenesis (Dang, 2012; Turner and Grose, 2010; Carmeliet and Jain, 2011) and encephalomyocarditis virus. Bi-cistronic luciferase assays and mRNA polysomal profiling assays showed an increase of translational efficiency of these mRNA in p53 inactivated cells compared to p53 wild-type cells (Figures S6G-S6I ).

Our data showed that p53 inactivation is sufficient to alter rRNA methylation patterning. In addition to regulating FBL expression, the role of p53 in optimizing the rRNA functional quality is reinforced by our observations that the level of some C/D-box snoRNAs is modulated according to the p53 status and that p53 is involved in the assembly process of the other major family of snoRNP (H/ACA box; Krastev et al., 2011) . Deciphering the mechanisms by which p53 inactivation alters the site-specific rRNA methylation pattern through FBL induction will require biochemical and structural studies dedicated to the understanding of formation, dynamics, and activities of the rRNA methylation complex. However, we can hypothesize that the improper induction of FBL expression observed in cancer cells leads to an alteration of the coordination between pre-rRNA production and the rRNA methylation enzymatic machineries.",

Indeed, the depletion of methylation of several rRNA methylation sites in yeast and human cells has been associated with a decrease in translation fidelity (such as an increase in nonsense suppression, frameshifts, and amino acid misincorporation; Baxter-Roshek et al., 2007; Baudin-Baillieu et al., 2009) . Moreover, modulating rRNA methylation by RPL13a depletion in HeLa cells modified the control of the translation initiation by IRES (Basu et al., 2011) . Modification in the rRNA methylation pattern in breast cancer cells exhibiting an induced aggressive phenotype was also associated with the alteration of IRES activity of key factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and p53 (Belin et al., 2009 ). In the present study, we demonstrate that the repression of FBL expression by p53 is accompanied by an increase of IRES-dependent translation initiation, affecting cellular as well as a viral IRES-containing mRNAs. These data are consistent with previous reports showing that the FGF2 mRNA translation is inhibited by p53, whereas the FGF2 mRNA IRES is aberrantly activated in transformed cells when p53 is inactivated (Galy et al., 2001) . It remains to systematically explore the effect of methylation sites, individually and as a pattern, in the intrinsic activity of the ribosome.",

The inhibition of rRNA methylation altered the IRES translation initiation by impairing the association of the 40S and 60S subunits (Basu et al., 2011) . Moreover, structural and biochemical studies showed that ribose methylation modifies the conformational state of the RNA backbone, stabilizes the RNA loops, and influences the overall structure of the modified RNA regions. Ribose methylation helps maintain the tertiary structure of rRNAs and potentially the rRNA-mRNA, rRNA-tRNA or rRNAprotein interactions (Blanchard and Puglisi, 2001; Liang et al., 2009) . Consistently, several 18S rRNA regions promote structural modifications when a viral IRES is bound to the 40S subunit (Spahn et al., 2004) and the efficient translation of IGF1R mRNA results from its IRES directly contacting an 18S rRNA domain through a Shine-Dalgarno-like interaction (Meng et al., 2010) . These data support the notion that rRNA methylation could participate in translational control by regulating IRES translation initiation.",

Elevated expression levels of FBL were previously reported in primary and metastatic prostate cancers compared with normal prostate epithelium and in squamous cell cervical carcinoma compared with normal cervix samples (Choi et al., 2007; Koh et al., 2011; Su et al., 2013) . Furthermore, we have shown the direct contribution of FBL overexpression in tumorigenesis. The maintenance and progression of cancer phenotype induced by FBL-mediated enhanced translation may involve several key cancer proteins whose synthesis is dependent upon IRES-containing mRNA. As shown here, (E) Impact of FBL overexpression on drug response was investigated by determining the IC 50 of doxorubicin using MTS assays. Error bars represent SD. The p values have been determined by a Mann-Whitney W test. (F and G) Kaplan-Meier analysis of relapse-free survival rates (event = relapse) (F) and of breast cancer-specific survival rates (event = death related to breast cancer disease) (G) according to FBL mRNA level in primary breast tumor samples. The data are dichotomized at the upper quartile value into high and low expression groups. See also Figure S7 and Table S2. these proteins may include IGF1R, which is involved in tumor progression, cell survival, and response to chemotherapy (Pollak et al., 2004) , c-Myc, which exhibits pleiotropic pro-oncogenic functions (Dang, 2012) , FGF1/2, which are involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Sakuma et al., 2012) , and VEGFA, which is involved in tumoral angiogenesis (Carmeliet and Jain, 2011) . Thus, high levels of FBL observed in human samples could have a role in tumor progression and could affect the clinical outcome of patients through alteration of translational regulation.",

In this model, p53 alteration in pathological cells results in the production of ribosomes with decreased translational fidelity and increased translation of the IRES-containing mRNAs selectively. Thus, the p53-mediated ribosome alterations could be in part responsible for the ''translational instability'' of cancer cells and contribute to the expression of the continuously In cells expressing functional p53 (top), p53 negatively regulates RNA Pol I activity to control ribosome quantity and FBL expression levels to control ribosome quality. This regulation would aim to coordinate the methylation of ribosomes and the rate of ribosome production according to the cell needs. These quality-controlled ribosomes allow a high translational fidelity together with a correct control of the balance between CAP-and IRES-dependent initiation of translation. In cells expressing a mutant or nonfunctional p53 (bottom), loss of the repression of RNA Pol I activity leads to an increase in rRNA synthesis. In parallel, p53 inactivation leads to an increase in FBL expression levels, resulting in a modification of the rRNA methylation patterns. Ribosomes with modified rRNA methylated translate mRNA with a lower fidelity (bypass of stop codon, amino acid misincorporation) and are more likely to initiate translation through IRES of mRNA coding for pro-oncogenic, anti-apoptotic, and survival proteins.",
