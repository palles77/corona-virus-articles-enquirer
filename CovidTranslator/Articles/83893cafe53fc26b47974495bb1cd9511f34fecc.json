            "text": "Background: A barrier to influenza vaccination is the misperception that the inactivated vaccine can cause influenza. Previous studies have investigated the risk of acute respiratory illness (ARI) after influenza vaccination with conflicting results. We assessed whether there is an increased rate of laboratoryconfirmed ARI in post-influenza vaccination periods. Methods: We conducted a cohort sub-analysis of children and adults in the MoSAIC community surveillance study from 2013 to 2016. Influenza vaccination was confirmed through city or hospital registries. Cases of ARI were ascertained by twice-weekly text messages to household to identify members with ARI symptoms. Nasal swabs were obtained from ill participants and analyzed for respiratory pathogens using multiplex PCR. The primary outcome measure was the hazard ratio of laboratory-confirmed ARI in individuals post-vaccination compared to other time periods during three influenza seasons. Results: Of the 999 participants, 68.8% were children, 30.2% were adults. Each study season, approximately half received influenza vaccine and one third experienced !1 ARI. The hazard of influenza in individuals during the 14-day post-vaccination period was similar to unvaccinated individuals during the same period (HR 0.96, 95% CI [0.60, 1.52]). The hazard of non-influenza respiratory pathogens was higher during the same period (HR 1.65, 95% CI [1.14, 2.38]); when stratified by age the hazard remained higher for children (HR 1\u00c171, 95% CI [1.16, 2.53]) but not for adults (HR 0.88, 95% CI [0.21, 3.69]). Conclusion: Among children there was an increase in the hazard of ARI caused by non-influenza respiratory pathogens post-influenza vaccination compared to unvaccinated children during the same period. Potential mechanisms for this association warrant further investigation. Future research could investigate whether medical decision-making surrounding influenza vaccination may be improved by acknowledging patient experiences, counseling regarding different types of ARI, and correcting the misperception that all ARI occurring after vaccination are caused by influenza.",

Additionally, immunologic interference related to vaccination may modify the risk of ARI in potentially different ways. For example, lack of viral interference has been hypothesized to increase the risk of ARI after influenza vaccination while temporary nonspecific immunity has been hypothesized to decrease the risk of ARI after influenza vaccination [8] [9] [10] .",

The end dates of each season varied to capture all cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza in the cohort. For this sub-analysis, children 6 months to 17 years of age were eligible if they had any vaccines recorded in the NewYork-Presbyterian (NYP) Immunization Registry and/or the New York Citywide Immunization Registry (CIR). Children who received two doses of influenza vaccine were excluded from the analysis of the season in which they received two doses due to potential challenges with interpreting events occurring during the partially vaccinated window between vaccinations. Because there is not a citywide registry for adult vaccinations, adults !18 years of age were eligible if they were patients at NYP, an academic health care delivery system that includes an ambulatory care network which provides primary care to New York City's underserved communities, and had !1 primary care visit or hospitalization between October 1 and the end of the study season of interest. Eligibility criteria were applied in order to ensure confidence in the collection of influenza vaccine information and were applied to each individual study season. Individuals were included for the duration of their active participation in the study.",

The frailty model includes a random variable in the Cox model in order to adjust for potential unmeasured confounders [19, 20] . All models were adjusted for season using a time-varying covariate (Autumn: September-November, Winter: December-February, Spring: March-May/ June) and three time-independent covariates: age (categorized by years: 4, 5-17, 18-49, and !50), gender, and prior diagnosis of chronic respiratory condition (collected as reported asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and/or chronic inhaler use).

            "text": "In this cohort study assessing the risk of ARI in post-vaccination risk periods during three influenza seasons, the hazard of ARIs caused by influenza was not higher in individuals during the immediate 14-day post-vaccination periods compared to individuals unvaccinated. This finding is consistent with the implausibility of acquiring influenza from inactivated vaccines. Similarly, consistent with randomized controlled trials, ARI symptoms without a detected pathogen was not higher in individuals during the immediate 2 days following vaccination compared with individuals unvaccinated [17, 21, 22] . Unexpectedly, among children <18 years, but not adults, there was a higher hazard of ARIs caused by non- influenza pathogens during the 14-days post-vaccination and other vaccinated days compared to unvaccinated children during the same time periods. Despite a higher hazard, the absolute number of vaccinated individuals who experienced ARI in the postvaccination risk period was low ( 3%). Potential explanations postulated include bias in reporting among vaccinated individuals and a nonspecific decrease in immunity to other respiratory pathogens among vaccinated individuals [9, 10] . While the latter hypothesis is biologically plausible, it should be validated in future studies. Patients' experiences of increased respiratory illness after influenza vaccination may be supported by our finding of an increased rate of laboratory-confirmed non-influenza respiratory infections in the 14 days following vaccination. However, the results of the current study should not be interpreted as a reason to change the recommendation for universal vaccination for prevention of influenza, a potentially severe illness with complications such as pneumonia, bacterial infections, hospitalizations, and death [1, 12, 21] . The influenza vaccine has demonstrated reduction in morbidity and mortality across age groups and baseline health statuses [21, 23] . Additionally, others have also suggested that interference can occur between respiratory viruses that may offer protection, including against influenza infection [6, 24] . For example, epidemiologic studies have shown that when peak incidence of one major virus occurs, other major viruses are absent [25, 26] . During the 2009 H1N1 epidemic, high circulation of rhinovirus was associated with reduced likelihood of H1N1 in France and Sweden [18, 27] . Prior studies have shown conflicting results in the postinfluenza vaccination risk of ARI. Similar to our findings, two studies found an increased risk of laboratory-confirmed non-influenza infections in vaccinated children compared to unvaccinated children in the months following vaccination [9, 10] . However, in two large vaccine safety studies researchers did not find an increased risk of medically attended illness in the two weeks following vaccination compared with control periods before and after vaccination [28, 29] . The limited periods evaluated in some of these studies and the outcomes of medically attended illness may not capture the true incidence of ARI post-vaccination [13] . Studies conducted during a single influenza season may have limited generalizability because of heterogeneity among circulating respiratory viruses and influenza vaccine-virus antigenic matches in different influenza seasons [9] [10] [11] . Our study attempted to overcome some of these limitations as it was conducted over three consecutive influenza seasons, included non-medically attended events, and examined an extended post-vaccination period. Our study design also minimized recall bias as ARI outcomes were collected through year-round surveillance using text-messaging and at-home nasal swab collection independent of exposure to the influenza vaccine. In support of our study design, we found expected results for the association of participant characteristics and seasonality with laboratory confirmed ARI. For example, children had a greater hazard than adults for non-influenza ARI throughout the study seasons [30] . The associations between chronic respiratory conditions and Spring with ARI without detectable pathogens may be suggestive of seasonal allergies [31, 32] .",

Our inclusion criteria were designed to minimize misclassification of vaccination status. Because there is no city registry for adult immunizations, it is possible that some adults included in the study had missing vaccination data if they were vaccinated outside of the hospital system. However, in our sensitivity analysis including only vaccinated adults we did not find a difference in the relative hazards of ARI compared to the estimates including all adults.
