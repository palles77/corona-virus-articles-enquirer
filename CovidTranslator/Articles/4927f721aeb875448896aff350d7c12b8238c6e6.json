According to WHO data, patients with atypical pneumonia appeared in 29 countries throughout the world by mid-2003. By June 2003, the total number of affected persons reached 8435, including 789 lethal cases [1] . The SARS causative agent was found to be a virus from genus Coronavirus of the Coronaviridae family [2] . Members of genus Coronavirus have been known for a long time. These are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that cause human and animal diseases [3, 4] . However, such a severe coronavirus infection have been previously extremely rare in humans. Because of the high risk of atypical pneumonia epidemic, the properties of SARS virus, a new member of this genus, are being studied extensively [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

To study specific reproduction of SARS virus, it was cultivated in the transpantable cell lines Vero, 293, and 4647, as well as in the diploid cell line L-68 at a multiplicity of inoculation of 1 : 10. Changes in the monolayer depended on the cell line. In the cultures of Vero and 4647, the cells became round-shaped, and the monolayer slipped down on the second and third days after the inoculation, respectively. Similar cell damage has was described previously, when coronavirus was isolated from a colt [9] . The virus cultivation in cells 293 and L-68 led to changes in the monolayer on the third day, specifically, the disruption of the monolayer because of local cell lysis. Virus reproduction in cells was monitored by the RT-PCR method. Amplification was conducted as described previously [7] using the BNIinS and BNIi-nAs primers developed in the Institute of Tropical Medicine (Hamburg, Germany) [7] . The samples taken from all passages of the cells studied were found to contain the SARS-virus RNA.",

Virion accumulation was also observed in the perinuclear space and smooth-membrane vacuoles. In cells of the Vero culture, the content of viral particles was significantly higher than in cells of line 293. In the culture medium, spherical viral particles 80-90 nm in size with specific surface projections forming a \"crown\" were revealed by negative staining (Figs. 1b, 1c) .

The rate of virus reproduction in Vero cells was also higher. The cell cultures L-68 and 4647 are approved for the use as substrate cultures for manufacturing vaccine preparations; line 293 is currently undergoing evaluation at the Tarasevich Institute of Certification and Control. None of the cultures used in this study contained contaminating viruses, mycoplasmas, and bacteria, and were not tumorigenic. Species affiliation of these cultures was confirmed by karyological analysis. Nevertheless, virus adaptation to these cell cultures, selection for nutrient media and cultivation conditions are required to develop an anti-SARS vaccine.",

The original diagnostic primers for a region of polymerase orf1b gene were used in this reaction. Alignment of the DNA sequences for all known variants of SARS virus was conducted. Using Oligo 6.31 software (Molecular Biology Insights, Inc. 2000), the following primers were selected in the regions containing no nucleotide substitutions: A 518-bp PCR-fragment was obtained using the pair of primers SARS(18076)F and SARS(18594)R. A 502-bp PCR-fragment was obtained using another pair of primers, SARS(15122)F and SARS(15624)R. Sequencing of both amplified fragments using a Beckman CEQ2000XL DNA Analysis System (Beckman Coulter) was conducted as recommended by the manufacturer. Comparison of nucleotide sequences of the amplified products showed that the fragment of SARS viral genome studied did not differ from the sequences previously included into the GenBank (GenBank-Ay 291315). Thus, the isolated RNA belong to SARS virus, and the above primers were used in positive control for the test-system VectoSARS-RNA-ampli-100 developed in the Vector State Center of Virology and Biotechnology. In addition, the obtained data testify to the genetic stability of the viral genome region that encodes polymerase orf1b during at least three passages of the virus.",
