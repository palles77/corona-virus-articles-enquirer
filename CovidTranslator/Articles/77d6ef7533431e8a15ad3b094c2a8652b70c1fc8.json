The presence of obfuscation is investigated in annual and interim reports and prospectuses, and is defined as the simultaneous use of writing with (a) low reading ease and (b) high readability variability. This is a new and more rigorous approach to the detection of obfuscation. This article offers one of three alternative explanations. Either management endorses the use of such a writing technique to permit deliberately a certain level of opacity from period to period so as to lessen investor anxiety about organizational impacts from environmental changes, or it seeks in some way to mislead by misrepresenting or concealing unpleasant facts; finally, obfuscation may occur because different people write different sections of corporate reports, or even different sections of one part of a report. There may of course be a mix of these explanations. The study examined external reporting documents of 60 Hong Kong public companies, and found reading ease to be difficult and variability to be pervasive. The study sought associations between obfuscation and corporate profitability, age, complexity and location of hardest to read passages. Management should note that obfuscation does occur in corporate communications, and that steps should be taken to eliminate or minimize any unintended writing of this nature. q",

            "text": "Public corporations report their affairs to stakeholders more or less continuously using diverse channels. Annual and interim corporate reports and prospectuses are augmented by 0890 Internet Web pages. In addition, there are regular news releases, proxy documents, newspaper reports, business magazines, newsletters from financial intermediaries, conference calls, television commentary, and radio programmes. Collectively, these sources supposedly provide sufficient information to enable rational investor resource allocation decision-making. However, the concern of this paper is not about the quantity of information but whether its presentation facilitates or impedes investor belief formation and revision. Communication of corporate disclosures embodies three elements: content (what), timing (when), and presentation (how). Effective communication requires that content be relevant to user needs. Determining the precise set of relevant information for all users remains an on-going issue despite extensive and protracted research and argumentation into what constitutes decision-useful information. Studies into the timing of information release have spawned an enormous capital markets literature. Presentation of information encompasses media (e.g. annual reports and the Internet), layout and format (e.g. general organization, fonts and margins), and technique (e.g. photographs, graphics, animation, tables and prose), each of which involves research exponents.",

Simplistically argued, unless information is presented in a manner which can be comprehended, arguments supporting the 'what' and the 'when' of corporate disclosures are less compelling. While narrative disclosures are only one form of informational disclosure, they are an important complement to the traditional financial statements and visual disclosures. Narrative communication is impaired unless there is clarity in writing. Distorted and confusing writing impedes a reader's fluent comprehension of intended messages, especially if it uses unnecessary and unfamiliar polysyllabic words and long sentences. Polysyllabic words do serve a useful role when they enable a compression of words and the expression of complex or ambiguous concepts. While a direct linkage between specific corporate narrative disclosures and investment behaviour has not been definitively established, any impairment is likely to impede a reader's ability to accurately interpret these messages and thereby hinder belief formation and revision.",

            "text": "This paper focuses on a specific issue of presentation, namely, obfuscation. The word obfuscation is used to describe a narrative writing technique that obscures the intended message, or confuses, distracts or perplexes readers, leaving them bewildered or muddled. Vague and unclear writing clouds straightforward issues. Such obfuscation can arise through the use of esoteric or obscurantist vocabulary and/or gobbledegook, extraneous and non-relevant information, long sentences with complex grammatical structures and/or high variability in reading ease, and convoluted and/or spurious argumentation. Obfuscation may be used as a form of impression management or perception engineering (Courtis, 2002) , and/or as a means for the deliberate inclusion of misinformation or disinformation in a text. For example, if negative information is to be reported, management might use obfuscation to mask and deflect attention to reduce the impact on readers' perceptions. While the employment of obfuscation may be subtle, its deliberate use is designed to be manipulative: the greater the subtlety, the more the manipulation may succeed. Seeking to be manipulative is not in itself necessarily sinister: putting the best gloss on fair and balanced information is a form of manipulation, and arguably an integral feature of all corporate reports and releases. The typical reader of reports may be expected to approach them anticipating such rhetoric. At the same time, manipulation may aim to misrepresent or conceal unpleasant or damaging facts. If obfuscated narrative disclosures distort perceptions, potential exists for misinterpretation and consequent belief revisions and adverse investment allocations.",

In the first case, management endorses the use of a writing technique to permit deliberately a certain level of opacity, and in this sense obfuscation is a contrived reporting phenomenon. Such a contrivance may include some non-malicious intention to enhance 'the story' and calm or reduce investor uncertainty, but it will also include a malicious intention to misrepresent, distort and deceive investors. In the second case, obfuscation may occur because different people write different sections of the report, or even different sections of one part of the report. An imbalance in writing ability and style plus a certain lack of fluency and co-ordination in content can leave an impression of obfuscation, and in this sense it is a reporting artefact. In summary, there are three explanations for obfuscation's presence, and what is all the more difficult for the reader is that all three may be present to more or less degree in any one report. The reader needs to be especially vigilant in detecting malicious obfuscation because of its potential investment loss-causing implications. Maintaining a healthy cynicism in reading may not be unwise. The non-malicious and multiple-author behaviours add noise to communication and are censurable for their nuisance value. The difficulty for the researcher is to identify the presence of obfuscation, separate deliberate intent from artefact and then, if needed, separate the non-malicious intent from the malicious.",

Corporate reporting seeks to capture an interpretation of economic reality on a routine basis whatever the current vagaries of economic conditions. Management is sensitive to the fact that they are unable to control all economic conditions, and they are acutely aware that not all economic conditions are always favourable. The economic environment is a dynamic one. It seems reasonable therefore, that management will build hedging into all of their interpretations and wordings, because they know that circumstances can change quickly, sometimes 1 Prior annual report readability studies over a 50 year period in several countries consistently find that readability levels fall within the difficult to read category of literature and that for fluent comprehension to occur the reader would need to possess a reading level equivalent to at least undergraduate.

If its presence is deliberate, it may indicate that management has something to hide, avoid close scrutiny, minimize or trivialise. In such cases management would use this tool to direct reader perceptions by masking the true nature of some problem. However, obfuscation is not a uniform phenomenon. It may occur in an extreme form, or appear very slight, and it may constitute a mixture with a malicious section craftily embedded within non-malicious sections. The detection of all of these possibilities requires constant vigilance on the part of the reader.",

            "text": "At the same time, not all advantages lie with report writers. Extreme deliberate obfuscation runs the risk of being detected with adverse publicity that would tarnish managements' image and send a negative signal to the capital markets. This would be especially the case for malicious obfuscation with its sensationalist journalistic appeal, investor litigious potential and regulatory authority censure. Given the unfavourable reputational and capital market effects that could result, it is hard to imagine management undertaking this course of action lightly. Extreme malicious obfuscation is not ruled out, but the possibility of punishment through adverse consequences is likely to limit its incidence, although when it does occur its consequences can be devastating for the investment community. 4 Hence, we are left with two more probable reasons for the presence of obfuscation as a matter of routine. The first is a mild form of deliberate but non-malicious obfuscation, not to deceive per se, but to give management some leeway from report to report to level the impact of their (optimistic and less optimistic) messages. Management does not want to promote investor uncertainty and cause volatility in the equity markets by exhaustively and precisely detailing every transitory economic condition. The second reason for obfuscation is tied to the manner in which narrative disclosures are written. Obfuscation is most probably linked to companies that use teams to prepare their external corporate documents (such as the annual report), with variability in writing styles inadvertently causing the problem. The use of teams of one kind or another can be expected in any complex entity issuing annual reports with the various parts experiencing diverse authorships. The issue is not whether multiple-authorships exist, but rather how material an effect this practice may have on obfuscation. 5 From this discussion, the basic research question is not so much whether obfuscation is present in annual reports but what level of obfuscation is present. The second question is what is the most likely explanation, or mix of explanations, for its occurrence? Depending upon the definition employed, a traditional formula-based readability methodology can be used to detect the presence of obfuscation, and some idea as to its severity. In order to attribute a probable cause for its presence, different research is needed. Companies identified as obfuscators can be asked, for example, whether annual report preparation teams write the prose. If they do, then there is a prima facie case that a team-writing process is the cause of the obfuscation. If they do not, there is a prima facie case that deliberate (and probably non-malicious) obfuscation is the cause. However, these simplistic assertions need rigorous testing, and a fuller discussion of future research is left to the end of the paper.",

Courtis (1998) in an exploratory study sought to explore the phenomenon by defining it as high variability in reading ease. Samples of Chairman's Address narratives were scored on the Flesch readability formula and coefficients of variation used to determine the degree of variability between passages. Low levels of variability indicated that the selected prose passages were written at a reasonably constant level of reading ease. High variability revealed markedly different levels of reading ease from passage to passage. Ceteris paribus, it was argued that this high variability should put a greater strain on the reader's cognitive processes, potentially increase frustration and annoyance, modify reading behaviour to skip difficult passages, and thereby detract from a full comprehension of the communicated messages. 6 High variability was used as a proxy for the presence of obfuscation. Using this measure it was established that variability is a pervasive aspect of the narrative writing within and between companies.",

The former study (Courtis, 1998) focused exclusively on the variability of reading ease scores across three measured passages within the Chairman's Address, one score calculated from the beginning, one from the middle and one from the end of this section of the annual report. High variability was used as the proxy because its occurrence showed that reading ease levels 'bounced around' the narrative disclosures. However, high variability by itself does not pinpoint the overall associated reading ease difficulty level. High variability could be associated with a high overall reading ease score, or with a middle of the road average reading ease score, or with a low overall reading score. A high reading ease score is equivalent to a reading difficulty that is judged to be easy, and might therefore offset or mollify the effects of obfuscation. Hence, a more stringent proxy is warranted to ensure that only an overall low reading ease accompanies high variability.",

This study expands the proxy of obfuscation to include writing attributes that show the simultaneous presence of high readability variability and a low Flesch reading ease score. These criteria strengthen the probability of identifying writing which is opaque and incomprehensible. Whereas it is possible for a company to write with high variability for nonmalicious/malicious and 'team writing' reasons discussed earlier, to write also with a low reading ease (i.e. high level of difficulty) increases the propensity that especial word crafting may have occurred. In other words, management that allows writing to occur in this manner may be making more of an effort to be oblique. Hence, the presence of obfuscation is proxied by the simultaneous existence of these criteria.

            "text": "It is important to note that there has been considerable theoretical as well as empirical ferment around the issues of language, writing and reading, and the nature of effective communication. Those involved in research in literary theory, narratology and reader response theory examine the relations between author, text and reader and are concerned with plain language communication. Harris (2000) questions the assumption of words as carriers of transparent meaning and the whole view of language as representational and of writing as pure substitute for speech. Steiner (1998) argues that all language is translation. Harris (2001) examines Saussure as an example of the way in which plain language theories have been destabilised. 8 The use of formula-based readability techniques is therefore but one strand. There has been much well-directed concern about whether the Flesch readability formula adequately measures adult reading ease. Flesch, like other formula approaches is a quantitative method of predicting whether readers of prose passages will comprehend the intended messages with fluent comprehension. The Flesch score seeks to present the same kind of information about comprehension ease that a writer would have to judge either through experience and feedback from readers, or measure through a comprehension test on the material. The success of the Flesch formula in providing meaningful predictive information depends on its ability to measure elements in the writing that are related to reader comprehension. These elements could come from content, style, format or organization. Only style factors have been found to be conveniently measurable within readability formulas (Courtis, 1986) . Klare (1974 Klare ( -1975 notes almost 70 versions of readability formula have been developed from an examination of 82 elements of style. Several formula recalculations and revisions, as well as computer applications have been also developed. Klare adds that a simple two-variable general purpose formula is usually sufficient for prediction, especially if one of the variables is a word or a semantic variable and the other is a sentence or syntactic variable. Counts of the two simple variables of word length and sentence length are sufficient to make relatively good predictions of readability (Klare, 1974 (Klare, -1975 . It is believed that length of word is related to speed of recognition, and that sentence length is related to memory span, i.e. words recalled. While sentence complexity is likely to be the real underlying factor in difficulty, length correlates highly with complexity and is easier to count. While these variables are not causal in difficulty, they have been found to be good indices of difficulty.",

At best they are only general estimates of reading difficulty. Their interpretation should consider the shortcomings which have been documented by Irwin and Davis (1980) and McConnell (1982) . Readability formulas do not, for example, examine the way new concepts are introduced. They do not consider how motivational the materials seem and they do not examine other factors necessary for reader retention, such as organisation and reinforcement. Moreover, they do not examine the match between the conceptual background of the reader and the conceptual load in the text. This means that a formula score will mask the ability of a poorly educated bookkeeper to understand accounting terminology better than a PhD in nuclear physics. Dreyer (1984) has considered other limitations. Formulas ignore factors which relate to syntax and complexity of sentences, such as unusual positioning of sentence components or clauses and the number of dependent clauses. Neither do they measure textual factors such as word frequency, concept density, level of abstraction, or whether ideas are organised coherently and logically. Formulas cannot distinguish between scrambled text and wellordered prose. Elements of format or graphic design which affect readability are ignored, such as colour, illustrations, style and size of typeface, length of type line, hyphenated words, long paragraphs, punctuation, and full pages of type.",

The pattern of reading ease ratings are shown in the table in the section on analysis and discussion. These are predetermined standards against which measured reading scores can be compared to indicate whether annual report prose is likely to be understandable to readers. A score above 50 is indicative that the reading material is comprehensible to the majority of readers. A score below 50 is indicative that the writing is comprehensible to readers with an educational attainment of some university. The prediction is that the closer the score is to zero, the more incomprehensible is the writing. and estimates of readability arrived at from independent comprehension testing show a 0.70 correlation coefficient with the McCall-Crabbs Standard Test Lessons in Reading (used extensively for testing reader comprehension).",

Variability is the metric, not reading ease per se. Similar reading ease scores indicate low variability. Conversely, dissimilar scores indicate higher variability. The extent of this variability between prose passages is captured via a wellaccepted statistic, namely, the coefficient of variation \u00f0V\u00de: This is a measure of relative dispersion between various reading ease scores. The coefficient of variation does not reveal whether the raw scores were from any particular reading ease category. Indeed, technically the same V score could be computed from many permutations and rankings of raw scores. 11 Reliance on V alone is an inadequate measure of obfuscation, and it is for this reason that the second criterion has been added as a measure of its presence, namely, 'low reading ease' writing.",

It is possible to obtain the same statistical computation for V from quite different reading ease raw scores. 12 Typically, the strongest claim that has been made by accounting researchers is that those responsible for preparing their annual reports might seek to improve the readability of their prose by using shorter sentences and shorter words.

The data used are the three Flesch Reading Ease scores per report for each of the 60 companies, i.e. 540 readability observations, or 180 scores per type of corporate report. The mean and standard deviation was obtained for each batch of three scores and then used to compute the coefficient of variation \u00f0V\u00de per report per company as per Courtis (1998) . 13 Two approaches are available to researchers in applying the Flesch formula. Microsoft Word includes a computer generated Flesch option, which for abbreviation-free prose computes a reliable measure. However, if the text contains many full stops as part of abbreviations, for example, P.R.C. as an abbreviation for the People's Republic of China, the computer programme recognises these abbreviations as three sentences and thereby seriously distorts the sentence length component of the score. This has an impact on the calculation of the Reading Ease score and can undermine the integrity of the true measure of readability of a passage. The alternative approach is to manually count syllables and sentence length and apply these scores into the readability formula. A comparison of the two approaches on a small sample of reports revealed the manual approach to be more reliable in computing Reading Ease scores.",

High variability, as measured by the coefficient of variation, shows that the reading ease level of the writing 'bounces around' within and between difficulty levels.

A concern about agency costs such as a rise in the cost of capital, and adverse reputational effects of management would dampen intent to obfuscate.

In such circumstances there is more potential for obfuscation to be present. To examine complexity, the source document chosen was the prospectus. It is a unique document in that its publication is ad hoc, and because it is a forum for wideranging discussion about the entity, regarding both past behaviour and future expectations. As such there may be more potential for this document to exhibit obfuscation on issues that might otherwise deter investor subscriptions. Moreover, the prospectus is frequently a lengthy document vis-\u00e0-vis the annual and interim reports. Complexity was proxied by the number of pages (in English) in prospectuses, i.e. higher pagination is equated to higher complexity. This resulted in the third hypothesis:",

It is possible that management endorses the use of a writing technique deliberately to permit or cause a certain level of opacity. There are two versions of this: non-malicious and malicious. A nonmalicious approach seeks to put the best rhetorical polish or 'spin' on the story-telling to give management some 'elbow room' in reporting from period to period and to reduce unnecessary investor uncertainty. To some extent this type of reporting behaviour is anticipated by readers and by itself is not especially harmful given the sophisticated analytical skills of investors. However, deliberate malicious obfuscation seeks to deceive by misrepresenting the true state of affairs and this can lead to unwarranted belief revisions and adverse allocation decisions. These are not either/or explanations, but rather there could be a mixture of the two, and it is precisely because of the malicious kind that readers need to maintain especial vigilance. An alternative explanation for the presence of obfuscation is that it arises when different people write different sections of the report, or even different sections of one part of the report. An imbalance in writing ability and style plus a certain lack of fluency and co-ordination in content could create statistical evidence of obfuscation, but in this sense it is a reporting artefact. The unique public company ownership structure in Hong Kong makes it improbable that management would see any necessity to use obfuscation as a perception engineering technique.

First, the overall average reading ease of the Chairman's Address of 37.3 across a sample of 60 Asian companies classifies readability as difficult on the Flesch reading ease predetermined scale. This finding corroborates other studies (see Courtis, 1995) and shows remarkable stability in annual report reading difficulty since 1986. In addition, this study provides the first benchmark readability statistic for interim reports (36.4) and prospectuses (34.6) against which future studies can be compared. Second, variability is pervasive across all three documents with 85% of the sample showing a coefficient of variation of 10% or more. This study has extended our awareness of variability to interim reports and prospectuses with average V scores of 25.5 for interim reports and 29.7 for prospectuses. Again, these statistics can be used as a benchmark for assessing future studies. Third, based on the dual criterion and the stringent test of presence in all three documents, obfuscation is chronic in 30% of the sampled companies. Fourth, there may be some association between obfuscation and the reporting of 'bad' news. Fifth, there may be some association between obfuscation and writing behaviour in interim reports. It is recommended that the interim report document be given more readability focus in future studies, especially because of its more timely nature in pinpointing change.",

The three explanations for obfuscation are that either nonmalicious/malicious managerial manipulation is occurring or it is a consequence of the preparation process itself. The three formal legal corporate documents examined detail complex financial, economic and other matters. As such they are normally beyond the expertise and time constraint of a sole person's ability to prepare. Groups or teams of individuals, either internal or external to the firm, can be expected to participate jointly in the writing of different sections of these reports, and obfuscation may emerge as a consequence. In other words, there is a prima facie case that the team writing process itself is the likely culprit. While we give the benefit of the doubt to this artefact explanation, nevertheless, it should not become a potential barrier to effective communication. Hence, management needs to be aware that obfuscation is frequently part of the communication package, and steps should be taken to ensure that any unintended writing of this nature is eliminated or minimized.",

Paramount is whether readers of corporate documents actually detect the presence of obfuscation, and if they do, whether it makes any difference to their perceptions about the company and to their belief revisions, expectations and investment allocations. Laboratory studies might conveniently investigate these matters by comparing subject reactions to narrative disclosures that are simple and clear versus those that are written deliberately to obfuscate in either a rhetorical polish or deceitful manner. We have no evidence at the present time about whether different writing techniques make any difference to investment decision making.",

            "text": "Another line of enquiry would be to survey companies to ascertain who specifically writes these corporate documents as well as the actual writing process. Other than anecdotal evidence, we do not know the extent to which public corporations use in-house teams or external consultancies in writing the copy that ultimately becomes part of the issued documents. We do not know the extent to which senior management is involved in the writing process. Nor do we know the extent to which an overseas head office is involved. We do not know whether an individual with technical writing skills writes the first draft, which subsequently becomes modified by the firm's legal representatives, senior management, and public relations and marketing personnel. Some information about these issues would assist us in determining the extent to which obfuscation is either linked to the writing process itself and the extent to which it is a consequence of rhetorical polishing or 'spin' that is Standard Operating Procedure, or a more serious misrepresentation that misleads as to the true state of affairs. We need to identify the cues that would detect the non-malicious use of obfuscation that seeks to ease the worries of investors, versus the deliberate intent by management to manipulate perceptions and divert attention from negative matters. 17",

            "text": "Further investigation could seek associations between obfuscation and different corporate attributes. The four variables considered in the study were illustrative and were not meant to preclude the possible role of other attributes. For example, a study of reported profitability volatility over a 5-year period may provide insights into the incidence of obfuscation. Another approach might consider the relative position of the firm within its industry. Is it a market leader, is it a very large company within the industry, and does it possess a wide or a concentrated spread of shareholders? This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of research areas, but is meant to identify at least some of the important issues that can be considered. The fundamental question remains as to how the presence of obfuscation can be more readily detected by the nonexpert reader and how the three most likely explanations can reveal the cause(s) in any one case. The detection of obfuscation and an assessment of its influence is of growing concern and relevance for the investment community that has witnessed cases (especially recently) where markets have been talked up by 'experts' only to crash. One consequence has been to flush out some of those involved in particularly malicious forms of obfuscation, while another has been to promote widespread distrust among the wider population of largely uninformed and non-expert investors.",

The letter 'a' refers to the hardest passage occurring at the beginning of the passage, 'b' to the middle of the passage, and 'c' to the end of the passage.
