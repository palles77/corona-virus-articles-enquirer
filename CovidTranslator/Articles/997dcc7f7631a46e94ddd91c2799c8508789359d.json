Microinjection of oocytes with a construct encoding the naturally-occurring UUU or AAC codon at the frameshift site demonstrated that the level of frameshifting was similar or lower than found normally in retroviral frameshifting in mammalian cells, suggesting that oocytes are a reliable system to study this event. Phenylalanine (Phe) or asparagine (Asn) tRNAs with and without the highly modified wyebutoxine (Y) or queuosine (Q) base, respectively, were microinjected to assess their ability to promote frameshifting. tRNA Phe +Y inhibited the level of frameshifting, while tRNA Phe \u2212Y promoted frameshifting providing evidence that the hypomodified form does not act only to enhance frameshifting, but is an essential requirement. Both tRNA Asn +Q and tRNA Asn \u2212Q were used indiscriminately in frameshifting, whether the frameshift site contained the wild type AAC, or the mutant AAU codon, suggesting that Q base modification status does not influence this process.",

The frameshift signal is a heptanucleotide sequence, X XXX YYZ. Unique features of the YYZ codon at the frameshift site is that only certain codons, e.g., UUU or AAC, occur at this position [ 4 ] . and, when UUU is changed to UUC or AAC is changed to AAU, the level of frameshifting is reduced substantially demonstrating that only one of two synonymous codons effectively promotes this event. These observations led Jacks and Varmus to propose the existence of shifty tRNAs that enhance frameshifting [ 4 ] . The phenomenon of preferential synonymous codon translation is unexpected since the same tRNA must decode one of its codewords far better than the other.",

Herein, Xenopus oocytes were found to meet these criteria providing evidence that tRNA Phe \u2212Y is essential in frameshifting. The data also suggest that tRNA Asn +Q or tRNA Asn \u2212Q are used indiscriminately in frameshifting as was reported previously [ 18, 19 ]. The results of these studies are described herein.",

[ 3 H]-Phe-tRNA Phe from oocytes was cochromatographed with [ 14 C]-Phe-tRNA Phe from calf liver. The tRNA Phe population of calf liver exists primarily as a single, fully modified isoform that contains Wye base [ 22 , see also Fig. 1A ]. Phe-tRNA Phe from oocytes fractionated into two major isoforms that contain Wye base and an earlier eluting, hypomodified isoform. The last eluting major isoform from oocytes likely represents an additional modification of the Wye base-containing species. Asn-tRNA Asn was resolved into a major, fully modified isoform and a minor, later-eluting hypomodified isoform as shown (Fig. 1B) . Since both of these tRNA populations in oocytes represent about 85% of the Wye and Q base containing isoforms, it would appear that oocytes are an ideal system to test the ability of the hypomodified isoforms to support ribosomal frameshifting, at least with respect to the endogenous tRNA population.",

The level of frameshifting with the wild type AAC codon at the frameshift site was enhanced only slightly by supplementing the lysate system with either tRNA Asn +Q(Sp) or tRNA Asn \u2212Q(Sp) (Fig. 4C) . Interestingly, programming rabbit reticulocyte lysates with GST-AAAAAAU reduced the level of frameshifting dramatically [ 1-3 ], but supplementing this protein synthesis system with either tRNA Asn +Q(Sp) or tRNA Asn \u2212Q(Sp) stimulated frameshifting about threefold (Fig. 4D) . These data further suggest that frameshifting of XXXAAAC signals, or for that matter XXXAAAU signals, can utilize tRNA Asn +Q or tRNA Asn \u2212Q indiscriminately to promote the frameshift event and that Q base modification status does not play a role in decoding one synonymous Asn codon better than the other.",

            "text": "The present study employing Xenopus oocytes as an \"in vivo\" system to examine ribosomal frameshifting was prompted in part because of the high levels of frameshifting observed in cell free extracts and yeast cells which often exceeded that present in retroviruses within host cells [e.g., see 12, 25 and references therein]. The levels of frameshifting found in Xenopus oocytes following microinjection of a construct encoding a retroviral frameshift signal with either UUU or AAC at the frameshift site was between about 4 and 10.5%. These levels are lower than, but more closely approximate, that observed in retroviruses in infected cells. This observation, coupled with the finding of low levels of potential shifty (hypomodified) isoforms within the endogenous tRNA population, suggest that Xenopus oocytes indeed serve as an excellent model system for elucidating mechanisms of retroviral frameshifting. The high levels of frameshifting observed in widely used rabbit reticulocyte lysates and yeast cells, even in the absence of exogenous tRNAs, make it difficult to assess, for example, whether hypomodified tRNA Phe is required for frameshifting to occur or the hypomodified form merely stimulates the frameshift event wherein the shift in reading frames can still occur in the presence of fully modified tRNA Phe , albeit not as efficiently. In fact, the use of Xenopus oocytes as a model system to elucidate the mechanism of frameshifting involving slippery tRNAs appears to have answered the question of whether tRNA Phe is required or merely enhances the frameshift event. The low level of frameshifting observed in oocytes microinjected with only GST-AAAUUUU (i.e., in the absence of supplemental tRNA) is enhanced more than twofold by enriching the endogenous tRNA Phe \u2212Y population (Fig. 3) further demonstrating that this isoform is a slippery tRNA. Furthermore, the fact that microinjection of tRNA Phe +Y which enriched the endogenous tRNA Phe population with the fully modified isoform reduced the level of frameshifting from about 4% in oocytes containing only GST-AAAUUUU mRNA to less than 3% demonstrates that the fully modified isoform inhibits the frameshift event [see also 12 ]. Thus, the approximately 4% level of frameshifting observed in the presence of only GST-AAAUUUU is apparently due to the small amount of tRNA Phe \u2212Y present intracellularly (Fig.  1A) . We therefore propose that tRNA Phe \u2212Y is the slippery tRNA, while the frameshifting event is inhibited in the presence of tRNA Phe +Y , and the hypomodified isoform is essential for the frameshift to take place.",

            "text": "The question of the requirement of hypomodified tRNAs in promoting ribosomal frameshifting has been of considerable interest as their restriction may provide an alternative avenue for inhibiting retroviral expression [ 2, 11, 26 ]. In the case of tRNA Asn , wherein Q base is obtained from the diet in mammals, and in the event Q base restricted the frameshift event, a diet rich in this base should theoretically reduce the endogenous population of tRNA Asn \u2212Q . Unfortunately, reducing the level of endogenous tRNA Asn \u2212Q does not appear to offer a means of restricting retroviral ribosomal frameshifting since either tRNA Asn isoform seems to be used indiscriminately at the frameshift site [ 18, 19 ] . However, it would be of interest to incubate oocytes in the presence of Q base to initially assess whether the endogenous tRNA Asn \u2212Q population (see Fig. 1B ) could be reduced prior to injecting oocytes with GST-AAAAAAC mRNA. In the event the endogenous tRNA Asn \u2212Q population can be reduced, then the level of frameshifting can be further assessed which should unequivocally determine whether Q base is involved in reducing ribosomal frameshifting. As long as there is any endogenous level of tRNA Asn \u2212Q (see Fig. 1B ), then the question of an involvement of this isoform in frameshifting cannot be completely resolved [ 18 ] . Interestingly, the reason that the occurrence of AAU at the frameshift site is inhibitory [e.g., see [1] [2] [3] [4] 24, 27 ) cannot be due to tRNA Asn modification as both isoforms also translate this codon indiscriminately [ 18 , and see Fig. 4D ].",
