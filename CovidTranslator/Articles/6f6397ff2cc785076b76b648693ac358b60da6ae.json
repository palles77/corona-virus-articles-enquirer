            "text": "It is believed today that nucleocapsid protein (N) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV is one of the most promising antigen candidates for vaccine design. In this study, three fragments [N1 (residues: 1-422); N2 (residues: 1-109); N3 (residues: 110-422)] of N protein of SARS-CoV were expressed in Escherichia coli and analyzed by pooled sera of convalescence phase of SARS patients. Three gene fragments [N1 (1-1269 nt), N2 (1-327 nt) and N3 (328-1269 nt)-expressing the same proteins of N1, N2 and N3, respectively] of SARS-N were cloned into pVAX-1 and used to immunize BALB/c mice by electroporation. Humoral (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA) and cellular (by cell proliferation and CD4 + :CD8 + assay) immunity was detected by using recombinant N1 and N3 specific antigen. Results showed that N1 and N3 fragments of N protein expressed by E. coli were able to react with sera of SARS patients but N2 could not. Specific humoral and cellular immunity in mice could be induced significantly by inoculating SARS-CoV N1 and N3 DNA vaccine. In addition, the immune response levels in N3 were significantly higher for antibody responses (IgG and IgG1 but not IgG2a) and cell proliferation but not in CD4 + :CD8 + assay compared to N1 vaccine. The identification of antigenic N protein fragments has implications to provide basic information for the design of DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV. The present results not only suggest that DNA immunization with pVax-N3 could be used as potential DNA vaccination approaches to induce antibody in BALB/c mice, but also illustrates that gene immunization with these SARS DNA vaccines can generate different immune responses.",

However, the N protein is distributed predominantly in the cytoplasm of SARS-CoV-infected and N gene-transfected cells [13] . The SARS-CoV N protein is a highly charged, basic protein that can self-associate to form dimmers [14] . The three-dimensional structure of the Nterminal portion of the protein shares similarity with that of other RNA-binding proteins. The coronavirus N protein is thought to participate in the replication and transcription of viral RNA and to interfere with cell-cycle processes of host cells. As a result, it plays a critical role in SARS CoV pathogenesis [14] [15] [16] [17] . In addition, the N proteins of many coronaviruses are highly immunogenic and expressed abundantly (90%) during infection [18] . High levels of IgG antibodies against N have been detected in sera from SARS patients [19] . The N protein can induce protective immunity or at least set up the protective response in some coronaviruses [20] . It is reported that N protein is a representative antigen for the T-cell response in vaccine setting [21] , induces SARS-specific T-cell proliferation and cytotoxic T-cell activity and induces virusspecific cellular responses in human cells using mouse model [21, 22] .",

However, the absence of an effective therapeutic agent against this relatively new lethal virus of animal origin, compounded by the threat of its potential for re-emergence, calls for the development of a SARS vaccine. Extensive efforts have been made for the Fig. 4 . N-specific lymphocyte proliferation assay. Pooled splenocytes were obtained from mice (five mice per group) immunized with the DNA vaccine on day 10 postimmunization. Splenocytes were stimulated in vitro with N protein (N1/N3-test groups), Con A (positive controls), and BSA (irrelevant antigen controls). Splenocytes from the control groups (pVAX-1 or PBS) were stimulated with N protein, and served as negative controls and sham controls. The stimulation index (SI) was calculated using the following formula: SI = (mean OD of Con A or antigen-stimulated proliferation)/(mean OD of non-stimulated proliferation). Each bar represents the mean SI \u00b1 S.D. of five mice. *p > 0.01 and **p > 0.05. Results in a study by Tan et al. [5] suggest that as early as 2 days after the onset of illness, there are IgM and IgA anti-N antibodies present in the blood, and by 9 days, IgA levels against N protein are very high. This finding that N protein induces a strong IgA response parallels the findings by Tripp et al. [27] that monoclonal antibodies against N protein are present in the mucosal epithelia, as detected by immunohistochemistry on autopsy samples. These locations include the alveolar epithelium, trachea/bronchus, esophagus, gastric parietal cells and the intestinal tract. Strong immunoreactivity towards N protein suggests that the protein may be released from the virus or from infected cells into the circulation during infection. Alternatively, it may be presented by antigen presenting cells (APCs) for cytolysis of target cells. N protein does not appear to undergo rapid mutation like S protein. Coupled with the fact that S protein is more difficult to express, N protein could be a better target for the development of serological assays.",
