Transmission of these viruses from an infected person or animal to a new host can occur via several routes. Existing studies strongly suggest that contaminated fomites or surfaces play an important role in the spreading of viral diseases. The potential of viral spreading via contaminated surfaces depends particularly on the ability of the virus to maintain infectivity whilst it is in the environment. This is affected by a combination of biological, physical and chemical factors. This review summarises current knowledge about the influence of environmental factors on the survival and spread of viruses via contaminated surfaces.",

For centuries it was assumed that these viral diseases were spread primarily through direct patient contact or by the airborne route, and surrounding environment played little or no role in disease transmissions. Due to the opinion that nosocomial infections were not related to microbial contamination of surfaces, the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and the American Hospital Association focussed only on patient diagnosis up to 1987. Over the years studies have changed perspectives on viral transmission and have integrated a more complex multifactorial model of disease spreading including the contaminated environment (Boone and Gerba 2007) .",

During indirect transmission, contaminated surfaces can play an important role. This kind of transmission is dependent on several factors, which include the quantity of viral particles excreted by an infected organism, their stability in the environment, the potential to spread within a closed environment, as well as interaction of the virus and the host organism. Large numbers of viral particles can be shed via various body fluids including blood, faeces, vomit, saliva, urine, and respiratory secretions from infected individuals or carriers. The more viruses are shed, the greater their chance is to survive and reach a new host organism (Rzezutka and Cook 2004) .",

Rapid spread of viral infections through contaminated surfaces is common particularly in crowded indoor establishments such as schools, day-care facilities, nursing homes, business offices, hospitals or transport systems (Barker et al. 2001) . The influences of environmental factors on the stability and spread of bacterial infections are well documented, especially in hospitals.

Information about the survival of HEV in environment is still lacking. Respiratory viral infections are a major health burden (Winther et al. 2006) . Although these diseases are often regarded as trivial, hospital admission and mortality rates in infant or elderly are considerable. For instance, respiratory viruses cause more than 400,000 hospitalizations per year in children less than 18 years of age in the United States (Henrickson et al. 2004 ). Viral agents that primarily infect the upper or lower respiratory tract include influenza and parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, rhinoviruses and enteroviruses (Kesson 2007) . It is generally accepted that respiratory viruses are spread from person to person by aerosol transmission due to sneezing or coughing (Goldmann 2000) . Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that a significant proportion of flu viruses and other respiratory viruses are spread via contaminated hands and fomites (Hall et al. 1980; Tiwari et al. 2006; Winther et al. 2007) .",

Abad et al. (2001) investigated the survival of an astrovirus at 4 and 20\u00b0C with a high RH (90 \u00b1 5%). At 4\u00b0C, the virus was able to persist for 60 days desiccated on non-porous material and for 90 days on porous material. Faster decay was observed at 20\u00b0C. Short-term survival of astrovirus was compared to that observed for other enteric viruses significant for health, such as rotavirus, adenovirus, poliovirus and HAV. Overall, astrovirus persisted better than poliovirus and adenovirus, although they exhibited a shorter survival than the rotavirus and HAV. Food Environ Virol (2010) 2:24-34 27 Amongst other factors, the effect of freezing on enteric viruses in berries and herbs was tested by Butot et al. (2008) . This study revealed that freezing does not significantly reduce the viability of norovirus, HAV and rotavirus. Only infectivity of FCV on strawberries can be decreased. Freezing for 3 months had a limited effect on HAV and rotavirus in all tested food products. A higher decay rate was observed in frozen raspberries and strawberries contaminated with FCV due to the acidic pH (Butot et al. 2008) . No reduction of MNV-1 PFUs was observed on frozen onions or spinach during storage for 6 months (Baert et al. 2008) . Kurdziel et al.

The obtained k-values, which characterise UV-sensitivity of the microorganism, are similar for FCV, rotavirus, poliovirus and Coxsackievirus. HAV is more sensitive then the abovementioned viruses. The correlation between low and high solar virucidal radiation and high and low influenza prevalence suggest that inactivation of viruses in the environment by solar UV radiation has a stronger effect than expected and can play a role in seasonal occurrence, e.g. influenza pandemics (Sagripanti and Lytle 2007) . Duizer et al. (2004) exposed surrogate caliciviruses (enteric canine calicivirus and respiratory FCV) to UV-B radiation as a factor affecting environmental survival. Results were comparable to enteroviruses (Gerba et al. 2002) , less effective than for vegetative bacteria, but more effective than for phage MS2 (Husman et al. 2004 ), adenoviruses (Gerba et al. 2002; Nwachuku et al. 2005) , and Baccilus subtilis spores (Chang et al. 1985) . Parallel analysis of four RNA virus models (poliovirus 1, phage MS2, phage GA and phage Qb) showed that the least resistant virus to UV radiation was poliovirus 1. Qb phage had intermediate sensitivity, whilst MS2 and GA phages were the most resistant. The rate of RNA degradation increased linearly with increasing fragment size, except viruses with a similar size of genome (poliovirus 1 and MS2). Based on these results, viral resistance to UV depends especially on fragment size of viral nucleic acid. Nevertheless, it also shows that the viral capsid structure has an important protective role against UV radiation (Simonet and Gantzer 2006) .",

The majority of viruses remain viable for a longer period of time on non-porous materials, although there are exceptions (Abad et al. 1994; Boone and Gerba 2007; Lamhoujeb et al. 2009; Tiwari et al. 2006 ); e.g. higher persistence of poliovirus and adenovirus was observed on porous materials (paper and cotton cloth) compared to nonporous materials: aluminium, china, glazed tile, latex, and polystyrene (Abad et al. 1994 ). The enteric viruses reveal exhibited inactivation rates (at least 2 logs lower) than respiratory viruses, with the exception of adenovirus and influenza virus (Boone and Gerba 2007) . Tiwari et al. (2006) studied survival of avian metapneumovirus and avian influenza virus on 12 different porous and non-porous materials. Both viruses persisted longer (up to 6 days) on non-porous surfaces than on porous ones.",

The greater survival was observed, if the inoculum also contained coliform bacteria, proteins, fats and dust particles, but no precise results or experimental details were given (Kiseleva 1971 as quoted by Rzezutka and Cook 2004) . Lee et al. (2008) found that murine norovirus is more stable in a stool suspension than on different types of surfaces. After 30 days of incubation at 18\u00b0C, there was a 2.7-log 10 reduction in the stool suspension, compared to the maximum reduction of 5.3-log 10 on a gauze or diaper surface. A study by Abad et al. (1994) showed that on non-porous surfaces, poliovirus and adenovirus persist better in the presence of faeces. However, on porous fomites the presence of faecal material has a negative influence on the survival of these viruses. HAV and human rotavirus persistence is not affected by the presence of faeces.",

Enteric viruses are able to survive severe conditions in the gastrointestinal tract, such as low pH in stomach or high bile concentration. They are generally most stable near pH 7, but prefer low pH's (3-5) rather than alkaline pH's (9-12). It was shown that noroviruses are able to persist at pH 2.7 and room temperature more than 3 h . As the surface charge of viral particles varies depending on the pH, disruption of electrostatic interactions between viral particles and environmental surfaces commonly consists of changing the pH, and thus affect viral persistence in the environment (Gerba 1984) .",

            "text": "One proposed mechanism of viral loss in the environment is inactivation by the direct or indirect action of microorganisms. Environmental isolates of bacteria with antiviral ability have been found on several occasions. These microbes are able to produce metabolites, which adversely affect viral particles, or can use the viral capsid as a nutrient source (Deng and Cliver 1995a, b; Ward 1982) . The inactivation of viruses by bacterial cultures is temperature dependent. The lower the temperature of the mixed waste, the longer the virus is able to persist. Moreover temperature could strongly influence microbial activity, and thus influence viral persistence (Deng and Cliver 1992) . Ward (1982) investigated the influence of mixed-liquor suspended solids (MLSS) of inactivated sludge on a poliovirus 1 survival. The first experiment was conducted in order to determine the effect of MLSS on the recovery of poliovirus after a different period of time. The second experiment was designed to find out the role of different MLSS components in virus loss. Results of these studies indicate that MLSS contain a component(s) which can inactivate poliovirus 1. These components were pelleted Food Environ Virol (2010) 2:24-34 29 during centrifugation, destroyed by autoclaving, and removed by filtration. Consecutively, residual activity of an MLSS supernatant fraction was also studied to confirm the absence of antiviral activity in non-living heat-sensitive material in the MLSS. Subsequent increasing activity of this supernatant, coupled with the previous results, strongly indicates the antiviral activity of some microbial species. Deng and Cliver (1992) demonstrated the antiviral effect of several bacterial cultures from swine manure slurry and mixed septic tank effluent. These cultures were identified as Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus sp. and Streptococcus sanguis group. A comparison of poliovirus 1 inactivation in raw mixed waste, autoclaved mixed waste, and bacterium-free filtrate of raw mixed waste demonstrated that virus inactivation is related, at least in part, to microbial activity in similar environmental conditions. Inhibition of poliovirus 1 inactivation by protease inhibitors suggested that antiviral activity of mixed waste was partially due to proteolytic enzymes produced by bacteria in wastes. Bacteria may also produce substances that inactivate viruses by processes other than enzymatic ones, e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa can produce substances with molecular weights below 500 Da which appear to inactivate viral particles. Substances with such low molecular weights cannot act enzymatically and they are referred to as virolytic substances (Cliver and Hermann 1972; Deng and Cliver 1992) . Deng and Cliver (1995a) studied the role of the microbial activity of animal wastes in inactivation of HAV. Ten out of 31 bacterial isolates were able to efficiently inactivate HAV. The inactivation capacity of four of the nine culture filtrates was significantly reduced by incubation with selected protease inhibitors before the virus was added. These inhibitors did not affect the activities of the other five culture filtrates. Fractions prepared by ultrafiltration (nominal molecular weights \\1,000 Da) from two of these cultures inactivated HAV suggested that their mode of action was not enzymatic.",

            "text": "From a public health point of view, biofilms have been already regarded as a common cause of bacterial infections. It has also been hypothesised that produced exopolymeric substances (EPS) may protect biofilms from viruses, especially phage penetration (Sutherland et al. 2004) . Recent studies have revealed that, even in the absence of specific enzymatic reactions, viral particles are able to penetrate inside the EPS structure of mucoid biofilms. After penetration inside the polymeric matrix, the viruses may take advantage from the specific 'biofilm lifestyle', and benefit from protection against environmental stress, such as desiccation or other actions of antimicrobial agents. Moreover during biofilms erosion or sloughing, protected immobilised viral particles may be released in the environment, and then contact their target host commencing the viral infectious cycle (Briandet et al. 2008; Helmi et al. 2008; Lacroix-Gueu et al. 2005; Lehtola et al. 2007; Quignon et al. 1997 ). Viral attachment rates to biofilms vary greatly and may depend on many factors such as the biofilm or viral characteristics (size, shape, isoelectric point), and concentration of viral particles (Helmi et al. 2008) . Helmi et al. (2008) reported that poliovirus 1 adsorption was higher in wastewater biofilm than in drinking water biofilm. Infectious viral particles were detected in the drinking water biofilm for up to 6 days after inoculation, whilst the viral genome was still detectable at day 34. Botzenhart (2002, 2003) injected phages MS2, uX174 and poliovirus 1 at comparable concentrations into a laboratory reactor containing approximately 100 ml of drinking water. After the contact time of 1 h, concentrations of 0.04, 0.13 and 0.27% were recovered from the biofilm. MS2 showed less adsorption to the biofilm than uX174 and poliovirus 1 (Hock and Botzenhart 2002; Botzenhart 2003 as quoted by Skraber et al. 2005) . These results can be explained by the fact that MS2 is more negatively charged than other tested viruses. In contrast, Storey and Ashbolt (2003a, b) estimated that the attachment rates of MS2 and uX174 were similar: 1% of the initial input. The efficiency of viral recovery was predetermined for MS2, but not for uX174 or poliovirus in the mentioned studies. Due to this fact, differences or similarities between apparent attachments can be explained by variation between efficiencies of viral recovery.",

Moreover, there is a problem of interference amongst viruses, which are able to grow on the same cell line (e.g. reovirus and enterovirus) or can allow chronic infections without a visible cytopathic effect (e.g. HAV or reovirus). Even if this cytopathic effect is evident, the identification of isolated agents requires additional techniques for confirmation of virus strain or type. Finally, cultivation methods cannot be used for non-cell culture viruses (e.g. HEV). For enumeration of infectious viruses it is necessary to use cell culture in a quantitative format, e.g. plaque assay. The number of infectious viruses remaining in the sample is compared with the number which was introduced, and a statistical procedure can be performed to calculate any degree of decline.",

They can be used for all types of viruses, require a short time for execution, can determine different agents in the same sample, and allow identification of non-cultivable virus. Nevertheless, analyses may be hindered by inhibitory substances present in the environment, so there is a risk of occurrence of false negative results. Due to this fact it is necessary to implement internal amplification controls. Moreover viruses detected by these techniques are not necessary infectious. Molecular methods can reveal nucleic acid originating from partially denatured viral particles. Thus, viral capsid is still capable of protecting nucleic acid, but the viral particle is not infectious. Therefore, the combination of molecular techniques and cell culture methods should be used for the detection of viruses (Cliver 2009; Cook 2003) .",
