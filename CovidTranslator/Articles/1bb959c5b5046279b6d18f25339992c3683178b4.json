            "text": "Once the euphoria of opening for business dies down, the reality that you have a lot to do will set in. You are probably impatient to get going and show your mettle. Emotions can get the better of you, for example being rushed into making a major dollar purchase because a salesperson made an offer that should not be refused but turned out badly, or facing a delay in one of your work schedules. These are some episodes that can lead you to make further poor decisions and responses that are inappropriate, upsetting the implementation of your action plan. Mistakes are easy to make and you are human. But getting out of such situations may not be easy because you may go through self-denial, justify your actions, or come up with some other excuse. Therefore, you may leave it too late to take corrective measures and the consequences may be an unrecoverable lapse into ruin.",

Reel in your bravado and check it at the door of common sense. Next follow your action plan because that was thought out at a time when you were sensible, emotion-neutral and thorough. If you are a business novice or virgin, do not permit the business theories you may have come across and all the advice you have been bombarded with to date to crowd your thoughts. Implement accordingly. As stated in Chapter 5, \"real-time\" situational awareness takes precedence over the plan once the rubber hits the road. Assess, evaluate and respond as the situation dictates. Most decisions do not require a nanosecond response. Seek counsel from your advisors, ask for more pertinent and updated information, discuss with your team before making an informed decision. Then act. It may be a simple matter of buying a few laboratory stools for your staff to sit on when doing an assay in the clean room or controlled area. Sometimes cheap does not mean a good buy. How heavy is the stool or can it be cleaned easily, and can the stool's material withstand constant contact with the cleaning agents? Making a poor choice could mean replacement of the stool frequently that may impact on work progress. Little things matter.",

Once we obtained our ISO9001 certification and IEC guide-25 accreditation, we were ready for business. The first BRASS-accredited test was the endotoxin test. The target clientele was dialysis centers, as Singapore by law required dialysis water to be tested for endotoxin and chemistry on a regular basis. We spoke to the dialysis centers in Singapore. One dialysis center chain had a regular tests service provider and was change averse. A smaller dialysis center chain and other dialysis clinics had an issue of liaising with two service providers, one for endotoxin testing the other for chemistry, impacting their already busy workload. BRASS had no chemistry capability at the time. But we knew we could sub-contract. Consequently, BRASS tied-up with an accredited chemistry testing laboratory and presented our bundling solution to the smaller dialysis center chain and the dialysis clinics. The nurses in charge readily accepted the gift from heaven, and we were off to the races.",

You have to accept this fact and be patient in walking your client through why their tests failed and demonstrate that the problem source was at the origin and not at BRASS. Because BRASS's operations follow an accredited way of working, there is enough evidence to support this assertion. But you still have to handle every incident well with tact. You are unlikely to be 100% faultless all the time.",

As you build your company, you should consider assembling a board of directors that can help you both in running the growing business, as well as in building the image of your company. Good directors can help you achieve bigger goals. Look for candidates you can trust from various backgrounds and experience. Ask around, seek recommendations and invite referrals. Persuade them if you have to, anyone good will have a busy schedule. Making it worth their while is not just about money as people at that level have more than enough. Some may wish to make a positive contribution to local businesses. Others may like to champion a cause for perhaps national pride or to give back to society. You may offer share options, but keep the director fees and claimable expenses modest.",

A financial expert oversees the finance of BRASS, reporting to the directors. Both board members and the financial expert are paid fees that are well below market rate. All are paid an annual profit-linked bonus. The in-country director also brought in a prominent local businesswoman who was once in charge of the Singapore operations of an international IT company to be a mentor to the BRASS general manager.

Setting up a SAB can be intense. You want to have leaders in the research field, and they are difficult to recruit. Why would they want to lend their reputation to a small outfit unless you know them personally? Even then it has to be in their interest to come on board.

Compartmentalization is unavoidable when you are transiting from start-up to a corporate mode of action. The best thing I did for BRASS when it started making good profits was to remove myself from the company and let a seasoned businessman hold the reins. He set a structure in place. When I returned in 2009, there was an admin department with an HR executive and a finance clerk. A sales department interacted with operations. Operations had various sub-units organized around the work done. Today, that structure has been further refined. You require structure when you grow, the extent depending on the pace of growth. This pace has to match your cash position. 4. You are known for one product, and when you grow, one product type. If you change category, or add new categories, your fortunes can change in an unfavorable direction. People know you for who you are. Stick with your identity and learn how to capitalize on it. This is about establishing and maintaining your business differentiation. 1 Remember who you are. My task in 2009 was to revitalize the science in BRASS. I changed the logo from a medical device theme to a more bio-based (a DNA double helix strand adorns the logo) format. Call this intuition because I had no idea BRASS would be more biopharmaceutical focused today. BRASS continued to progress because old and new clients know and rely on BRASS's foundation, science.",
