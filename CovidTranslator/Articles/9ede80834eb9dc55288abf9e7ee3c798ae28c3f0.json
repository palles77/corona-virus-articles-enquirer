            "text": "Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. PHEV mainly causes two types of clinical manifestations representing vomiting and wasting and encephalomyelitis in piglets. However, our recent findings provide strong evidence that PHEV can also cause respiratory disease in older pigs. Genomic analysis of new PHEV strains identified in our former study further classifies PHEV into three genotypes. Detection and differentiation of these new mutants are critical in monitoring PHEV evolution in the field. In the present study, we report the development of a triplex real-time RT-PCR assay for detection and differentiation of three PHEV genotypes, 1, 2, and 3. Three sets of primers and probes were designed; one set of primers and probe targeting the conserved regions of the 3\u2032 end nucleocapsid for detection of all three genotypes and another two sets of primers and probes targeting the regions of NS2 with different patterns of deletions for detection of both genotypes 1 and 3, or genotype 3 only. Genotype 1 was positive when two probe dyes showed signals, genotype 2 was positive when only one probe dye showed a signal, and genotype 3 was positive when all three probes showed signals. The detection limit of the developed triplex real-time RT-PCR was as low as 8 or 9 DNA copies for three sets of primers and probes. The specificity test showed no cross reaction with other porcine viruses. Positive field-samples were correctly typed by this new assay, which was further confirmed by DNA sequencing. The triplex real-time RT-PCR provides a rapid and sensitive method to detect and differentiate all three US genotypes of PHEV from clinical samples.",

PHEV typically affects pigs less than three weeks of age and the clinical syndromes include the vomiting and wasting disease (VWD) and encephalomyelitis (Quiroga et al., 2008) . PHEV was first isolated from suckling piglets suffering from encephalomyelitis in Canada in 1962 (Greig et al., 1962) . PHEV has since been identified in many countries of Europe, Asia, and America (Cartwright et al., 1969; Dong et al., 2014; Forman et al., 1979; Hirahara et al., 1987; Mengeling, 1975; Pensaert and Callebaut, 1974; Quiroga et al., 2008; Rho et al., 2011) . Although PHEV infection has been endemic in different countries for decades and the primary route of PHEV infection is through upper and lower respiratory tracts, only few reports suggest an association of the virus with respiratory disease in swine (Cutlip and Mengeling, 1972) . Recently, we have demonstrated that PHEV caused an influenza-like illness (ILI) in affected pigs and provided evidence for the role of PHEV as a respiratory pathogen (Lorbach et al., 2017) . In that study, a significantly higher positive rate 38.7% (108 of 279 pigs) was observed in pigs at the Michigan fairs compared to 4.1% (23 of 560 pigs) in Indiana and Ohio, indicating the PHEV-associated epizootic behavior in the Michigan fairs (Lorbach et al., 2017) .",

Previous genomic characterization and analysis reveal that PHEV is closely related to bovine CoV and human CoV OC43, and have identified truncated NS2 and NS4.9 genes in the PHEV-VW572 strain (Vijgen et al., 2006) . Prior to our study (Lorbach et al., 2017) , only one complete PHEV genome sequence (PHEV-VW572) was available in GenBank. We completed the full genomic sequencing of 10 PHEV isolates, and the analyses of complete genomic sequences showed that PHEV formed three distinct genotypes. Interestingly, genotypes 1 had deletions in NS2 and NS4.9, while genotype 3 showed no deletion and genotype 2 has a large deletion in the NS2 gene (Lorbach et al., 2017) . The prevalence and distribution of three genotypes remain unknown in pigs in the United States.",

These porcine coronaviruses cause neurologic (PHEV), digestive (TGEV, PEDV, PDCoV, PEAV, PHEV), and respiratory diseases (PRCV, PHEV).
