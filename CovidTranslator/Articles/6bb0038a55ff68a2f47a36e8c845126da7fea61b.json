Inhalation of cigarette smoke and industrial fumes containing cadmium are sources of cadmium exposure. It is responsible for the malfunction of various organs, leading to disease particularly in the lungs, liver and kidneys. In the present study, the effect of cadmium chloride (CdCl 2 ) on cell viability, and the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1 and IL-10 cytokines at various concentrations and incubation durations were assessed in MRC-9 human normal lung and A549 human lung cancer cells to elucidate the mechanism of cadmium toxicity. Cell viability was measured using a crystal violet dye binding assay. The expression levels of the cytokines were measured by cytokine specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The viability assay results revealed higher sensitivity of the A549 lung cancer cells to CdCl 2 compared with the normal MRC-9 lung cells. In the normal MRC-9 lung cells, higher expression levels of the cytokines were observed at the lowest CdCl 2 concentration at a shorter exposure time compared with the lung cancer cells. Higher levels of the cytokines were observed in the A549 lung cancer cells at all other times and concentrations compared with the MRC-9 cells, indicating higher levels of inflammation. The cytokine levels were reduced at higher CdCl 2 concentrations and longer exposure durations, demonstrating the toxic effect of cadmium. The results indicated that CdCl 2 affected the expression levels of the cytokines and led to cytotoxicity in human lung cells, and suggested that compounds which reduce inflammation may prevent cadmium toxicity.",

It is an industrial toxicant, which has been classified as a type I carcinogen (1, 2) . It is a highly reactive metal and complexes with ligands to form different compounds, which affect numerous biological molecules and organs (3) . A significant quantity of cadmium is introduced into the environment through anthropogenic activities, including copper and nickel smelting, electroplating, galvanizing, nickel-cadmium battery production, welding, phosphate fertilizers, sewage sludge and cigarette smoke (3, 4) . The toxicokinetics of cadmium depend on the form of cadmium, the dose, the time of exposure and the accumulation in the affected organ (5, 6) . Cadmium can be observed in all organs of the body; however, the majority accumulates in the lungs, liver and kidney (7, 8) . Although the level of cadmium exposure to humans is low, it can accumulate and remain in the system for 15-30 years (9) (10) (11) , which is responsible for the toxicity in various organs. Cadmium molecular toxicity has been associated with various diseases, including tumor formation.",

Organisms respond to xeno-biotics via inflammation and it is initiated through various signaling molecules, including cytokines, in the cells. To date, few investigations into the expression levels of the cytokines, IL-1\u03b1 (pro-inflammatory) and IL-10 (anti-inflammatory), have been reported (27) .

This may be one of the contributing factors for the higher sensitivity of cancer cells to cadmium toxicity, however, further investigation is required to prove this hypothesis. Normal lung cells and the lung cancer cells revealed high expression levels of the IL-1\u03b1 and IL-10 cytokines following treatment with CdCl 2 (Figs. 1 and 2) . In a previous study (29) , a significant increase in IL-1\u03b1 and IL-10 cytokines was observed in the tested cells, when human-derived bronchial epithelium was exposed to tobacco smoke components. Furthermore, other previous studies have revealed that cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines during inflammation, to activate the cytokine network and the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (30, 31) . The higher expression of cytokines, which lead to inflammation, may be responsible for the later cytotoxic effects in the cells, which lead to a decrease in viability, as observed in the present study (Fig. 1 ). This is supported by a previous study (32) demonstrating that high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines due to cadmium exposure cause pathological conditions in a biological system.",

This was consistent with our previously reported findings (24) and another previous study (35) . IL-10 acts as anti-inflammatory cytokine and is also responsible for cell death. IL-10 cytokine has been demonstrated to decrease the translocation of nuclear factor-\u03baB, which is important in increasing apoptotic markers, which later leads to apoptotic cell death (31) . Therefore, the higher levels of IL-10 cytokine in the A549 lung cancer cells may be one of the reasons for the higher cytotoxicity caused by CdCl 2 (Fig. 1) .",

Higher concentrations of cadmium induced higher levels of reactive oxygen species, which degrade macromolecules, including proteins and DNA (12, 13, 36) . The low expression levels of the IL-1\u03b1 and IL-10 cytokines in each cell line may also be linked to the toxic effect of unbound cadmium in the cells, as a result of the lack of metallothionein protein. This result is consistent with a previous study, which reported inhibition of the expression of IL-1\u03b1 in rat hepatocytes following treatment with high concentrations of CdCl 2 (32) . In addition, longer exposure durations may also be a factor in causing higher toxicity, as decreased expression of cytokines were observed with increased incubation durations in the present study (Figs. 2 and 3) . The longer exposure duration led to the accumulation of cadmium inside of the cell, which in turn causes decreased cytokine levels leading to cell death.",
