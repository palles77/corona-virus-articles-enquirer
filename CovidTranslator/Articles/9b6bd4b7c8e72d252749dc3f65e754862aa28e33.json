As one of the ''neglected'' tropical diseases, dengue is affecting substantially increasing number of people and proportion of global population due to factors including globalization, human settlement, and possibly climate change. Here, the authors summarized the most recent data about dengue outbreaks in China and reviewed the global trend of dengue epidemiology. Future directions for dengue surveillance, control and prevention are also introduced.",

Dengue has emerged as a worldwide problem, with a 30-fold increase in incidence globally in the past 50 years (Fig. 2) [4] . Today, dengue is regarded as the most prevalent and rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease of humans [4] . It is found in at least 100 tropical and subtropical countries, including countries in Africa, Southeast Asia, the western Pacific, the Americas, the Caribbean, and the eastern Mediterranean regions [3, 5] . More than onethird of the world's population lives in areas at risk of infection with dengue virus [3] , and a recent estimate using cartographic approaches in 2013 showed that 390 million people have dengue virus infections per year, of which 96 million cases manifest symptoms worldwide [6] .",

Due to the severe muscle, joint and bone pains, dengue is also known as ''break bone fever''. Most dengue patients recover after a few days, but some DF patients develop dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS), which are severe and sometimes fatal forms of the disease [7] . About three quarters of dengue infections can be asymptomatic, especially in children and those Y. Li [3, 7] . However, secondary dengue infection is one of the two factors thought to be associated with increased risk of disease severity; the other factor is infection by particularly virulent strains of dengue viruses [8] .",

Other efforts that China has made to prevent and control dengue include control of mosquito vector density, enhanced surveillance for imported cases, improvement of diagnosis and treatment, enhancing the cooperation among the related different public health departments and neighboring countries, and engaging communities to combat the epidemic [11, 12] . In response to the dengue outbreak in 2014, four technical guidelines [13] , including surveillance of DF cases, laboratory tests and diagnosis, surveillance of dengue vectors, and control of dengue vectors, were developed and issued by China [4] CDC, together with the previous two dengue guidelines (Diagnosis and Treatment of Dengue Fever in 2014 and Dengue Outbreak Investigation and Management in 2006) issued by the National Commission for Health and Family Planning, formed a complete national technical framework for dengue control and prevention [13] .",

All four dengue viruses are detected in China [11] . Upon review of the surveillance data collected by the monitoring program started in 2005 with a focus on southern provinces asdescribed above for the past years, a changing circulation pattern of DF has been observed in Guangdong, from nonendemicity (no virus sustained), to hypo-endemicity (one serotype present), and even hyper-endemicity (multiple serotypes present) of dengue infections [15] . In the last two decades, the biological behavior and vectorial capacity of Aedes mosquitoes have changed significantly in China, possibly due to urbanization and global climate changes [12] . Therefore, dengue illnesses have spread from southern coastal regions to the relatively northern and western areas of the country, and the interval between epidemics has become shorter since the 1990s compared to those that occurred before the 1990s, beginning with the first reported outbreak of DF in Guangdong in 1978 [11, 12] . In 2013, a severe dengue outbreak of 1,245 cases happened in Yunnan Province, with a significant proportion of severe dengue cases; DENV-3 was identified to be the cause of the outbreak using real-time RT-PCR assays [16] . In the same year, the first dengue outbreak in central China was reported in Henan Province, a northern temperate province of China; 73 of 106 suspected DF cases of this outbreak were confirmed DENV-3 infections [17] .",

According to the Guangdong Provincial CDC, the peak of the dengue outbreak was reached on October 1, and case numbers started to decline after October 11 [19] . Guangdong is located in a subtropical zone in China, and it has a high relative humidity, which may have created climatic and environmental conditions conducive to the proliferation of Aedes species. The DF epidemic area in Guangdong was mainly located in the old town which is under construction, and the poor sanitary infrastructure may contribute to this DF epidemic. A previous study from Guangdong showed that urbanization substantially increased the density, larval development rate, and adult survival time of Aedes species, which in turn potentially increases the vector capacity, and therefore, disease transmissibility [20] .",

Dengue is an acute febrile illness, and only diagnostic testing can accurately determine the etiology of the syndrome and differentiate dengue from acute febrile illness caused by other pathogens. However, the current dengue surveillance programs in China and internationally are all syndrome based (that is, entail clinical case-definitions without laboratory confirmation) and almost all are passive [23] . With the development of sensitive and specific diagnostic algorithms and increased awareness of dengue expansion, robust, laboratory-based dengue surveillance is needed to document and monitor the regional and global dengue incidence, and to evaluate the effectiveness of dengue control interventions. More accurate epidemiological and surveillance data will support greater political prioritization for this currently ''neglected'' disease. It would also allow improved decision making and rational allocation of financial, research, and other resources to the areas of greatest need [24] .",

Vector-borne diseases such as dengue have raised public health concern worldwide due to climate change, global trade, worldwide travel, and urban crowding. ''One Health'' is a relatively new term, but the concept that the health of humans is connected to the health of animals and the environment has long been recognized [27] . It has become more important in recent years because many factors have changed the interactions among humans, animals, and the environment, which have caused the emergence and reemergence of many diseases, including dengue. Successful public health interventions for disease control require the cooperation of the human health, veterinary health, and environmental health communities [27] .",
