Methods: The current retrospective study is aimed at assessing the range of CMV DNA loads quantified in BAL fluid specimens from allo-HSCT patients with pneumonia in which different microorganisms were causally involved. Results: A total of 144 BAL specimens from 123 patients were included. CMV DNA was detected in 56 out of 144 BAL fluid specimens and the median CMV DNA load from patients in whom CMV pneumonia was unlikely or could be tentatively ruled out was 1210 (31-68, 920) IU/ml. The frequency of CMV DNA detection and median CMV DNA loads were comparable, irrespective of the attributable cause of pneumonia. Detection of CMV DNA loads in BAL fluid specimens > 500 IU/ml was independently associated with pneumonia-attributable mortality. Conclusions: The current study highlights the difficulty in establishing universal CMV DNA load thresholds in BAL fluid specimens for distinguishing between CMV pneumonia and pulmonary CMV DNA shedding, and suggests that the presence of CMV DNA in BAL fluid specimens beyond a certain level may have a deleterious impact on patient outcome.",

Proven CMV pneumonia can only be diagnosed using virological, histopathological or immunochemistry methods on biopsied lung tissue 1 ; this specimen type, however, is rarely obtained due to potential life-threatening complications. Traditionally, culture-based bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) testing has been the mainstay for suggesting CMV involvement ex vivo , 3 although detection of viable CMV in BAL fluids only points to a probable causality. 4 may be present in the absence of probable or proven disease (pulmonary CMV shedding). [5] [6] [7] [8] Recent studies suggested that quantitation of CMV DNA in BAL fluids may permit discrimination between these two conditions 9 -11 ; specifically, a cut-off CMV DNA level > 500 IU/ml was proposed to serve that purpose, this displaying a positive predictive value of roughly 50% for probable CMV pneumonia using current prevalence rates. 10 Nevertheless, validation of diagnostic viral load threshold across centers using different real-time PCR assays for CMV DNA quantitation and procedures for BAL obtention seems of paramount relevance. This task is hampered by the very low incidence of CMV pneumonia nowadays ( < 2%) 3, 12 and the difficulty in establishing an incontrovertible diagnosis, even when lung tissue specimens are available for testing. 13 -16 Exploratory studies gathering information on the range of CMV DNA loads measured in BAL specimens from allo-HSCT patients with pneumonia in whom CMV causality is unlikely or can be reasonably ruled out may provide useful information and are thus warranted. Here, we report on our experience on this matter.",

Unrelated allo-HSCT recipients were treated with oral valganciclovir (900 mg/day) through day 180 after transplantation. At this center, plasma CMV DNA load was quantified using the CMV R-GENE\u00ae (Biomerieux, L'Etoile, Paris, France), 23 which displays a limit of detection of 150 IU/ml, prior DNA extraction using the Virus/Pathogens Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) on the QIAsymphony DSP platform (Qiagen). Plasma CMV DNA monitoring was performed once a week within the first 100 days, fortnightly from day 100 to day 180, and every 2-4 weeks thereafter through day 365 after transplantation. Detection of any level of CMV DNA in plasma prompted the administration of antiviral therapy with (val)ganciclovir or foscarnet at the doses specified above. Anti-CMV therapy was given at the physician discretion when patients with CMV DNA detected in BAL specimens had concurrent CMV DNAemia with CMV DNA levels below the threshold for preemptive antiviral therapy.",

Inevitably, all these drawbacks were encountered in this study, so that we aimed not to establish a diagnostic cut-off, but rather to assess the range of CMV DNA loads quantifiable in BAL fluid specimens from patients in whom the causal involvement of CMV was highly unlikely or could be reasonably discarded; this, having in mind that we surely incurred CMV pneumonia infradiagnosis.

Interestingly, median CMV DNA loads were comparable irrespective of the nature and the number of co-detected microorganisms (at both participating centers), and were overall higher in the presence of concurrent DNAemia. As for the latter observation, in agreement with Boeckh et al., 10 we found this not to be due to pulmonary hemorrhage (not shown). Overall, CMV DNA loads in BAL fluid specimens processed at HLF were of greater magnitude than those analyzed at HCU. Since CMV DNA loads produced by the Argene PCR assay are slightly lower than those measured by the Abbott PCR assay (not shown), differences in the net state of immunosuppression of patients at the time of BAL sampling across centers, as reflected by the immunodeficiency score index (higher for HLF patients), may account for this observation.

Here, the opposite was true, with nearly 60% of BAL fluid samples from patients with non-proven CMV pneumonia having CMV viral loads > 500 IU/ml, of which 75% had > 1000 IU/ml. It is worth highlighting that these figures were comparable at both participating centers, despite the above-referred differences in CMV DNA loads provided by PCR assays used at each center. To gauge the potential relevance of these data, it must be taken into consideration that in nearly 70% of pneumonia episodes in our cohort, BAL sampling was performed while patients were under anti-CMV therapy ( > 3 days), whereas in the aforementioned study, 10 only 24% of patients with CMV pneumonia and 35% of patients with non-CMV pneumonia had been treated with antivirals for at least two days. Despite this fact, higher CMV DNA loads in BAL fluid specimens were quantified in the current study, likely reflecting major differences regarding the DNAemia cut-off triggering the inception of antiviral therapy between these studies (much higher in the current cohort). In fact, in this series, the median CMV DNA load in BAL was significantly higher in patients who were under antiviral therapy than in non-treated patients.",

In this sense, we fully support the idea that the magnitude of such a diagnostic cut-off is likely to vary depending upon the patient's characteristics, the BAL procedure and processing, the assay used for CMV DNA quantitation and the severity of CMV pneumonia at the time of sampling. 4 Our data should be interpreted with caution as the exclusion of CMV as the probable causative agent can be judged as dubious in some cases provided that no virological methods were used to investigate the presence of CMV in BAL fluid specimens. In particular, there were 4 episodes occurring in 4 patients who died, in whom CMV DNA was detected at high levels in both BAL and plasma specimens ( > 10 0 0 IU/ml) and no alternative microbial etiology was documented. Nevertheless, the conclusions drawn on the basis of the overall dataset stood when cases in which little or no doubt existed on the lack of involvement of CMV (i.e. bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis.) were analyzed separately (representative examples are shown in Supplementary Table 4) .",

            "text": "CMV is a highly pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive virus; as such it may act as a synergistic co-pathogen in the absence of documented CMV-induced cytopathogenicity, and may have a relevant impact on patient outcome. 3 In this sense, we found that the presence of CMV DNA in BAL fluid specimens at levels > 500 IU/ml, in addition to receipt of corticosteroids and low lymphocyte counts at the time of BAL sampling, was associated with increased pneumonia-attributable mortality in Cox multivariate models. The relative scarce number of pneumonia cases in which BAL specimens had CMV DNA loads > 500 IU/ml did not allow to investigate whether this apparent effect exhibited a dose-response pattern. Again, this finding must be interpreted cautiously, as in order to avoid overfitting, Cox models were not adjusted to a number of factors that may have had an impact on mortality (i.e., adequacy of antimicrobial treatment, severity of pneumonia, among others). The limited size of the current cohort also precluded any meaningful statistical analysis evaluating the impact of CMV DNA load in BAL at each center, separately. Further studies are urgently needed to validate this observation, since this subset of patients may benefit from short courses of anti-CMV therapy. 10 Limitations of the current study, in addition to the ones highlighted above, are its retrospective nature, the potential biased selection of patients requiring bronchoscopy for the etiological diagnosis of pneumonia, the lack of normalization of CMV DNA loads in BAL fluids to cellular DNA content (although this was reported to be expendable in a previous study 10 ) and the use of different DNA extraction platforms and real-time PCR assays for CMV DNA quantitation. Nevertheless, this study has several strengths, including the inclusion of consecutive specimens, the use of fresh BAL fluid specimens and highly-sensitive real-time PCR assays for CMV DNA load quantitation, and the performance of a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of specimens for the presence of RVs pathogens using molecular assays.",
