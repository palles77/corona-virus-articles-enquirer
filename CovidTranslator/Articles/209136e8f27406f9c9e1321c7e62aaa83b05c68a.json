Specific strategies targeting these groups are needed for effective outbreak communications.",

Among international visitors, China had the largest proportion (52.7%) followed by Japan (16.1%) and English-speaking countries (9.2%), including the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Among foreign residents, Chinese were also the largest group (52.3%, though 66% of them were Korean-Chinese) followed by people from the United States of America (7.6%) and Viet Nam (7.2%). provided English-language press releases beginning 28 May. 5 A toll-free telephone hotline also started service in English on 12 June; 6 it expanded to include 18 other foreign languages on 15 June. 7 This report describes the usage of these multi-language communication channels during this MERS outbreak.",

Postings that contained these keywords were extracted and grouped into three categories: press release, statistics and other information for analysis. Website usage was evaluated by counting the total number of visits to the site and average visits per posting in the period of data collection. Hotline usage was evaluated by the number of calls received. Telephone hotline data from 12 June to 5 July 2015 were collected and stratified by day and by language for analysis. Data manipulation and analysis were conducted using Excel (Microsoft Excel, Redmond, USA). Unlike the hotline call services, the MOHW and MERS portal websites provided information only in English. This might be a limitation, but sharing information in English should cover most of the foreign populations as we found English was the most commonly accessed language in the hotline service in this study. While Chinese accounts for the largest portion of international visitors and foreign residents in the Republic of Korea, utilization of the Chinese hotline was less than expected. This may be due to the fact that 66% of the Chinese residents were Korean-Chinese. They might not need the service as they are able to speak the Korean language or have Korean relatives who are able to translate the information for them.",
