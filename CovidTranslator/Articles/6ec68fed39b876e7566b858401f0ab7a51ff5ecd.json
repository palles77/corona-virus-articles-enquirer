The probability is good that most ferrets will develop a neoplasm of the endocrine system during the \"golden age\" for tumors (4 to 6 years) and excellent that some type of neoplasm will become evident over the course of a lifetime. In ferrets from American bloodlines, the incidence of three neoplasms-adrenocortical neoplasia, insulinoma, and malignant lymphoma-exceeds the incidence of all other neoplasms combined.",

The clinical behavior, prognosis, and paraneoplastic syndromes in ferrets are often far different than those seen with similar neoplasms in dogs or cats. Insulinoma in the ferret is a neoplasm that rarely metastasizes to distant organs and may be associated with prolonged survival, as opposed to the same neoplasm in dogs and cats, which metastasizes widely and results in short survival times. Adrenocortical carcinoma, a neoplasm that is prone to metastasize widely in the dog, metastasizes only late in the course of disease in ferrets and, with early removal, warrants a good prognosis. Mast cell tumors, often malignant (and fatal) in the dog, are invariably benign and associated with a good prognosis in ferrets. Practitioners who extrapolate diagnostic and therapeutic options from comparable syndromes in more traditional pet species may find themselves in difficult and unexpected situations.",

            "text": "aberrations have yet to be studied in domestic ferrets, but the tremendous incidence of neoplasia in American bloodlines of ferrets compared with their European counterparts certainly lends credence to this widely held belief. Fox et al. 16 document a syndrome of multiple neoplasms in an adult ferret that closely resembles multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 in humans, a condition caused by a genetic mutation. 2. Infectious agents. Suspicious cluster outbreaks of malignant lymphoma in laboratory colonies and rescue operations 1 14 in 1995 demonstrated the transmissibility of this neoplasm between ferrets by using cell-free inocula, furthering this theory, although a prolonged incubation time was required. Helicobacter mustelae, a ubiquitous inhabitant of the stomach of ferrets, has been circumstantially incriminated in the development of gastric adenocarcinoma, 15, 17, 21 which is enhanced when coupled with ingestion of chemical carcinogens as promoters, as well as in the development of gastric Bcell lymphomas. 11 3. Early neutering. There is widespread speculation that early neutering at 4 to 6 weeks of age, a common practice in the United States, may be responsible for the high incidence of adrenal neoplasia in this country. In Europe and Australia, where this is not practiced, adrenal neoplasia is rarely seen. A recent publication in The Netherlands 31 indicated a link between age at neutering and age at the onset of hyperadrenocorticism; however, it did not show an increased incidence of hyperadrenocorticism in ferrets neutered at an early age. 4. Light cycles. It has been suggested that the ferret's innate sensitivity to light may be upset by Americans' predilection for housing ferrets indoors with artificial lighting. In Europe, where most ferrets are housed outdoors and exposed to natural lighting cycles, the incidence of neoplasia, especially adrenocortical, is greatly decreased. 4 5. Diet. Theories abound concerning the impact of commercially prepared diets on the development of neoplasms in ferrets. The higher concentration of carbohydrates in commercially available food in the United States has been suggested as a primary cause for the increased incidence of insulinoma compared with rates seen in other countries, where raw whole prey (e.g., rats, mice) are fed as the dietary staple. 4",

In these studies, lymphoma was both the most common hematopoietic neoplasm and the most common malignancy. Between 12% and 20% of cases in each study had multiple tumor types, with insulinoma and adrenocortical carcinoma most often seen concurrently. 4, 24 However, the presence of multiple tumor types in an individual animal should not be interpreted as a neoplastic syndrome arising from a common tumorigenic mechanism. In a study of 66 cases in which ferrets had multiple concurrent neoplasms, 24 there was no evidence of an association between tumor type and multiplicity. Because endocrine neoplasia is extremely common today in ferret bloodlines in North America, it seems reasonable that multiple tumors would develop over time in middle-aged or geriatric ferrets.",

Although various classification schemes for lymphoma exist, including those based on human lymphoma, 1,10,13 the following classification scheme based on broad cell type and distribution is both reproducible and relevant to practitioners. The most commonly seen form of lymphoma, occurring primarily in older ferrets, is the lymphocytic form. In this variant, the neoplastic cell is a mature, well-differentiated lymphocyte; the lymph nodes are the most affected sites, resulting in peripheral lymphadenopathy, with visceral spread and organ failure occurring late in the course of disease. A second form, the lymphoblastic form, is seen primarily in young ferrets less than 2 years of age. Visceral neoplasms early in the course of disease characterize this form, in which the neoplastic cell is a large, immature lymphocyte. In most cases, the thymus, spleen, and liver are involved, resulting in profound organomegaly. An enlarging thymic neoplasm often results in compression of the lung lobes, dyspnea, and pleural effusion and may often be misdiagnosed as pneumonia or heart disease. A third relatively uncommon form, which is characterized by combinations of peripheral lymphadenopathy, visceral tumors, and the predominant cell type, is a lymphoblast with occasional bizarre karyomegalic or multinucleate forms known as the immunoblastic polymorphous variant.",

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia indicates a more mature form and the distribution of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, with total leukocyte counts rarely exceeding normal. Acute lymphocytic leukemia suggests lymphoblasts in the bone marrow as well as in the peripheral blood, with leukocyte counts well in excess of normal.

Owners often notice clinical signs well before the disease state reaches a critical point. Many cases are associated with cycles of illness and apparent recovery, which may be precipitated by treatment with antibiotics or steroids. In most ferrets with lymphocytic lymphoma, generalized lymph node enlargement is the most common sign ( Fig. 9-2 ), but at times animals are seen simply for chronic lethargy, inappetence, and weight loss.

Animals with concurrent adrenal disease or insulinoma, two very common diseases that strike the same age group as most cases of lymphoma, may significantly complicate chemotherapeutic protocols. 4 2. Inappropriate use of chemotherapeutic agents. Successful chemotherapy often relies on the complex interaction of agents given at specific intervals. The choice of agents based on expense, availability, or ease of administration will affect success rates. 3. Resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. It is well documented that ferrets previously treated with prednisone for other conditions (insulinoma, inflammatory bowel disease, pemphigus) have a diminished response to prednisone when it is subsequently used as part of a chemotherapeutic protocol. 4, 38 It is best to give lymphoma patients a poor prognosis at the outset of chemotherapy. Longer periods of remission have generally been reported in animals with lymphocytic (adult-onset) forms of lymphoma. 4 Because of the variable and generally slow progression of adult-onset lymphomas, it is often difficult to assess the true benefits of chemotherapy. In fact, one group of ferrets survived 2 years (considered the upper limit of remission) with no treatment. 10 Treatment of lymphoma in ferrets should follow a careful evaluation of the patient's age, concurrent disease and therapy, type of lymphoma, and distribution and staging of tumors. Ferrets with tumors of the stomach, intestine, bone marrow, or liver generally have the poorest response to therapy. 4 Removal of focal lesions (single nodes, spleen, and so on) may be of benefit before initiating chemotherapy. 1, 4, 10 Multiple chemotherapeutic protocols have been used in ferrets and are presented in Tables 9-2 and 9-3. The following generalizations and cautionary statements should be noted before chemotherapeutic agents are used in ferrets: 1. Chemotherapeutic agents should be used carefully to minimize risks to the patient, technician, and veterinarian. Intravenous chemotherapeutic agents should be administered through a vascular access port 27 or a well-maintained catheter to an anesthetized or sedated ferret. Extravasation of most chemotherapeutic drugs often results in extensive tissue damage and loss of the vein for the remainder of the treatment period. 2. Consultation with a veterinary oncologist and referral should be considered for veterinarians whose experience with these agents is limited. 3. Careful and frequent monitoring of the clinical status and blood values, to include a weekly platelet count and a CBC, should be part of every chemotherapy protocol. Other chemotherapy agents have been used in the treatment of ferrets with lymphoma in addition to those listed in Tables 9-2 and 9-3. For example, doxorubicin (alone and in conjunction with radiation) has been attempted for treatment of lymphoma in ferrets (2 mg/kg IV q21d for 3-5 treatments). 20 If traditional multiagent chemotherapy is not an option, palliative therapy often results in a significant decrease in tumor burden for several months. All forms of lymphoma tend to be initially responsive to steroids. Adult-onset forms may show a less significant response to the mature lymphocyte's innate steroid resistance; however, all neoplasms tend to recur over a period of months. When tumors recur, they are steroid resistant. Ferrets that have been receiving prednisone therapy for other diseases (insulinoma, chronic bowel disease) tend to be resistant to definitive and palliative forms of chemotherapy and have shorter mean survival rates. 4,38 A minimum oral dose of prednisone (2.2 mg/kg q24h) should be used and increased as needed to decrease tumor burden and alleviate clinical signs. Fortunately, steroid-induced gastric ulceration is not common in ferrets, even with high-dose regimens.",

Dietary supplementation with a number of highcalorie, high-protein supplements is often necessary for supporting cancer patients. Gerber Second Foods Chicken (Gerber, Inc., Fremont, MI) is well tolerated by most ferrets, may be fed by hand rather than by syringe, and makes an excellent vehicle for the administration of unpalatable medications. 38 Hill's a/d (Hills Pet Products, Topeka, KS) is also widely used, as are a variety of supplements with high-calorie human supplements as a core ingredient, such as Ensure (Abbott Labs, Abbott Park, IL) or Deliver 2.0 (Mead-Johnson Pharmaceuticals, Evansville, IN) combined with any number of additives. Vitamin and mineral supplementation may be required in animals maintained exclusively receiving these types of supplements. 4, 38 If nutritional supplements are administered by syringe, use a rate of 2 to 5 mL q2-3h. Ideally, ill ferrets can be trained to drink gruel from a saucer or bowl, at which time they can be fed every 4 hours. 38 If these products are used for more than 30 days, the ferret's normal ration should be ground up and added to the mixture. This will ensure that all trace mineral and vitamin requirements are met and facilitate the animal's eventual return to normal rations. Ferrets eating a high-quality feline or ferret maintenance diet generally do not need additional mineral or vitamin supplements. 38 A key to the proper fluid and nutritional support of the ferret patient is the delegation of this activity to the owner to the greatest extent possible. Many ferret owners are capable of giving subcutaneous fluids and hand-feeding ferrets when such activity is required on an around-the-clock basis. Therefore encourage owners to take an active role in nursing as early in the treatment cycle as possible.",

Immunohistochemical procedures to identify tissue-specific intermediate filaments or ultrastructural analysis of cellular organelles by electron microscopy may identify characteristic organelles for a particular cell type. Today the use of sophisticated techniques at large referral laboratories may help in identifying the origin of a particular neoplasm, thereby enabling the practitioner to develop a strategy for the treatment and prognosis of these tumors.
