Results: Using CRISPR DNA-fragment editing, in conjunction with chromosome conformation capture, we find that CTCF sites, if located between enhancers and promoters in the protocadherin (Pcdh) and \u03b2-globin clusters, function as an enhancer-blocking insulator by forming distinct directional chromatin loops, regardless whether enhancers contain CTCF sites or not. Moreover, computational simulation in silico and genetic deletions in vivo as well as dCas9 blocking in vitro revealed balanced promoter usage in cell populations and stochastic monoallelic expression in single cells by large arrays of tandem CTCF sites in the Pcdh and immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) clusters. Furthermore, CTCF insulators promote, counter-intuitively, long-range chromatin interactions with distal directional CTCF sites, consistent with the cohesin \"loop extrusion\" model. Finally, gene expression levels are negatively correlated with CTCF insulators located between enhancers and promoters on a genome-wide scale. Thus, single CTCF insulators ensure proper enhancer insulation and promoter activation while tandem CTCF topological insulators determine balanced spatial contacts and promoter choice.",

CTCF directionally and dynamically binds to tens of thousands of CTCF-binding sites (CBS elements) in mammalian genomes through the combinatorial usage of its 11 zinc fingers [9, 10] . CTCF, together with the associated cohesin, a ring-shaped complex embracing DNA, mediates genome-wide long-range chromatin interactions [2] . Interestingly, these interactions are preferentially formed between forward-reverse convergent CBS pairs [11] [12] [13] [14] . The CBS elements in the boundaries between neighboring chromatin domains are configured in a reverse-forward divergent orientation, which are thought to restrict enhancer activity to promoters within each insulated neighborhood [12, 15, 16] . Thus, the boundary CBS elements may function as insulators to block cohesin loop extrusion [11, 12, [17] [18] [19] [20] . However, whether and how internal CBS elements function as insulators remain incompletely understood.",

The Pcdh \u03b1 and \u03b3 clusters contain more than a dozen highly similar, tandem-arrayed, unusually large \"alternate\" variable exons and 2 or 3 divergent C-type variable exons, respectively (Fig. 1a) . These variable exons are followed by 3 downstream small constant exons, reminiscent of the variable and constant genome organizations of immunoglobulin (Ig), T cell receptor (Tcr), and UDPglucuronosyltransferase (Ugt) clusters [26, 28, 33] . Each of the Pcdh\u03b1 \"alternate\" variable exons (\u03b11-\u03b112 in mice) carries its own promoter, which is flanked by two forwardoriented CBS elements (Fig. 1a) . However, the \u03b1c1 promoter carries only one forward-oriented CBS, and the \u03b1c2 promoter has no CBS element (Fig. 1a) . Two distal Pcdh\u03b1 enhancers, HS7 and HS5-1, are located downstream, and one of which, HS5-1, is flanked by two reverse-oriented CBS (HS5-1a and HS5-1b) elements [34, 35] . Multiple long-distance chromatin interactions between these remote enhancers and Pcdh\u03b1 target promoters form a transcription hub and determine the promoter choice, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown [35, 36] .",

We performed CBS insertions by DNA-fragment editing and screened for single-cell CRISPR clones (Fig. 1c, d) [37, 38] . We first nserted single (\"F\") or tandem (\"FF\") forward-oriented CBS elements into the location between the Pcdh\u03b1 cluster and its HS5-1 enhancer (Fig. 1d-f ) and carried out quantitative highresolution chromosome conformation capture copy followed by next-generation sequencing (QHR-4C) experiments (Additional file 1: Figure S2 ). QHR-4C revealed prominent long-distance chromatin interactions between HS5-1 and the inserted CBS elements, and a concurrent decrease of chromatin interactions between HS5-1 and the Pcdh\u03b1 promoters (Fig. 1g -j and Additional file 1: Figure  S3a ,b). In addition, CBS mutations abolish these effects (Fig. 1g -j and Additional file 1: Figure S3a ,b). Consistent with the decrease of enhancer-promoter interactions, RNAseq revealed a significant decrease of \u03b16 and \u03b112 expression levels, and CBS mutations rescue their expression (Additional file 1: Figure S3c ,d). In summary, the inserted forward-oriented CBS elements block the long-distance chromatin spatial contacts between the HS5-1 enhancer and its target promoters and thus function as chromatin insulators by competing with the target Pcdh\u03b1 promoters. We next inserted three different reverse-oriented CBS elements each into distinct locations in the Pcdh\u03b1 cluster (Additional file 1: Figures S3e-j and S4 ). We found that each competes with the HS5-1 enhancer to form long-distance chromatin interactions with target promoters and thus functions as an insulator (Additional file 1: Figures S3e-j and S4 ). Finally, we inserted reverse-forward CBS pairs (\"RF\" or \"RRFF\") into the Fig. 1 CTCF sites as insulators in Pcdh\u03b1 through directional chromatin looping. a Schematic of the three mouse Pcdh clusters. Genomic organizations of the Pcdh \u03b1 and \u03b3 clusters are similar. Both contain variable exons, each of which is preceded by its own promoter and spliced to respective downstream constant exons. The Pcdh\u03b2 cluster contains only variable exons. Each of the variable exons (except \u03b1c2, \u03b21, \u03b3c4, and \u03b3c5) carries one or two forward-oriented CTCF sites (indicated by tandem arrowheads). Two distal enhancers, HS7 (with no CBS) and HS5-1 (flanked by two reverse-oriented CBS elements of HS5-1a and HS5-1b), are located between the Pcdh \u03b1 and \u03b2 clusters. The super-enhancer of the Pcdh \u03b2 and \u03b3 clusters, which contains a tandem array of reverse-oriented CBS elements, is located downstream of Pcdh\u03b3.

Log2 ratios (insertion vs wild-type or mutation vs insertion) are shown under the 4C profiles location between the Pcdh\u03b1 cluster and the HS5-1 enhancer.

We found, surprisingly, these inward forward-reverse CBS elements still function as insulators. Specifically, QHR-4C and RNA-seq revealed a significant decrease of chromatin interactions between HS5-1 and the Pcdh\u03b1 promoters as well as their decreased expression (Additional file 1: Figure S7b -f).

Deletion of the HS5-1b CBS (Additional file 1: Figure S12a ,b), which is at the boundary between the Pcdh\u03b1 and Pcdh\u03b2\u03b3 subTADs [12] , results in an aberrant increase of long-distance chromatin interactions between HS5-1 and the 5\u2032 isoforms of the Pcdh\u03b2 cluster (Fig. 4g , h) as well as an aberrant activation of their promoters (Fig. 4j) . Remarkably, even for the Pcdh\u03b21 promoter, which does not carry CBS, the long-distance chromatin interactions with HS5-1 is still aberrantly increased, suggesting that HS5-1b CBS functions as an insulator to block the HS5-1 enhancer from the improper activation of the Pcdh\u03b21 promoter (Fig. 4h ). By contrast, both the chromatin interactions of HS5-1 with the proximal alternate Pcdh\u03b1 genes as well as their expression levels are significantly decreased (Fig. 4g, i, j) . This suggests that the boundary HS5-1b CBS element is an insulator that restricts the HS5-1 enhancer activity from the aberrant activation of the Pcdh\u03b2 promoters. As a control, homozygous deletion of the internal HS5-1a CBS element (Additional file 1: Figure  S12a ,b) results in no expression alteration of the 5\u2032 isoforms of the Pcdh\u03b2 cluster (Fig. 4k) . Therefore, although both HS5-1a and HS5-1b CBS elements are required for bridging the HS5-1 enhancer to the Pcdh\u03b1 promoters (Fig. 4g , i-k), only the boundary HS5-1b CBS element functions as an insulator blocking the HS5-1 enhancer activity from aberrantly activating the Pcdh\u03b2 genes.",

WT, wild-type; del, deletion QHR-4C with 5'HS5 or 3'HS1 as a viewpoint, which contains a CBS element located outside of and beyond the \u03b2globin enhancer and promoter regions, respectively, revealed opposite chromatin looping interactions with the inserted reverse-forward CBS pair (Additional file 1: Figure  S13b -d). Thus, CBS elements, if inserted between enhancers and promoters with no CBS, also function as insulators by forming long-distance chromatin looping interactions with CBS elements located in the endogenous genome outside of and beyond respective enhancer and promoter regions. Finally, we inserted various combinations of CBS elements upstream and/or downstream of the HS7 enhancer, which contains no CTCF site, of the Pcdh\u03b1 cluster and found that the inserted CBS elements block longdistance chromatin interactions of the HS7 enhancer (Additional file 1: Figure S13e -g). In conjunction with the data of the endogenous Pcdh CBS deletion, we conclude that CBS elements function as insulators for enhancers with no CBS.",

In particular, the allelic insulation ( Fig. 5l ) by CTCF-mediated directional looping may be epigenetically regulated by methylation of CBS elements [35, 48] . Some CBS elements, such as the boundary Pcdh HS5-1b site, contain no CpG dinucleotides [35] . Consequently, the HS5-1b site has constitutive and cell-invariant CTCF/cohesin occupancy and functions as a chromatin insulator for the downstream Pcdh\u03b2 genes (Fig. 5l ). Other CTCF sites are regulated by DNA methylation and have a cellspecific pattern of the CTCF/cohesin occupancy in single neurons [28] . For example, each CBS within the alternate variable promoter of members of the Pcdh \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 clusters contains a CpG dinucleotide that is methylated in specific subpopulations of neurons in the brain [28, 35, 49] . Therefore, the 5\u2032 boundary CBS element of each Pcdh loop domain is cell-specific and distinct for single neurons, thus functions as a chromatin insulator for its respective upstream genes (Fig. 5l) . Consistently, our computational modeling suggests that members of the three Pcdh families are expressed monoallelically in individual neurons (Additional file 1: Figures S1 and S9) [40] .",

Specifically, for any unmethylated promoter CBS element, it forms long-distance chromatin contacts with downstream enhancers and therefore is activated through chromatin looping. These chromatin looping interactions function as an insulator for all of its upstream Pcdh\u03b1 promoters, resulting in inactivation or silencing of them in each chromosomal allele (Fig. 5l ). In addition, all of its downstream Pcdh\u03b1 promoters are not activated because by mathematical definition, if any downstream promoter is activated by enhancer looping, none of its upstream promoters could be activated (Fig. 5l) . Similarly, for the more complex regulation of the Pcdh \u03b2 and \u03b3 clusters, our genetic experiments demonstrate that they are topologically regulated by the tandem CTCF sites within the downstream superenhancer (Figs. 2 and 3), as explained in the Hulu model of topological gene regulation (Fig. 5m) . Therefore, only one isoform of the Pcdh\u03b1 cluster (Additional file 1: Figure S1a ,b) and up to 4 isoforms of the Pcdh \u03b2 and \u03b3 clusters (Additional file 1: Figure S9a ) are expressed from each chromosomal allele in individual neurons in the brain (Fig. 5l) .",

Because each CBS element has permeability for cohesin sliding [20] , continuous active chromatin loop extrusion by cohesin in an ATPdependent manner bridges inner convergent CTCF sites first (Fig. 5n) . After sliding through the inner proximal CTCF sites, cohesin will then stall at the intermediate tandem CTCF sites (Fig. 5n) . Finally, cohesin will reach the outer distal CTCF sites (Fig. 5n) . Based on our experimental observation and mathematical prediction in the clustered Pcdh and Ig genes, the two \"heads\" of cohesin are stalled or anchored at CTCF sites in the two arrays of convergent tandem CTCF sites, resulting in long-range chromatin interactions between proximalproximal CBS elements as well as between distal-distal CBS elements (Fig. 5m, n) . In other words, two \"heads\" of cohesin complex anchor proximal-proximal or distaldistal CBSs through continuous active loop extrusion of chromatin fibers which are asymmetrically blocked by permeable CTCF insulators. The functional consequences of these interactions caused by tandem CTCF insulators are the decreased proximal chromatin interactions and increased distal chromatin interactions. Thus, tandem directional CTCF sites function as topological insulators to balance higher-order chromatin contacts and promoter choice, eliminating bias of spatial chromatin accessibilities between proximal and distal promoters by remote enhancers.",

CTCF mediates specific directional loop formation through asymmetric anchoring of the ring-shaped cohesin complex, which slides along chromatin fibers to actively extrude loops [3, 12, 18, 19, 33, 51] . Our data are consistent with the predominant chromatin interactions between forward-reverse CBS pairs [11, 12] . In addition, there are numerous cases of tandem CTCF sites across mammalian genomes [12, 16, 33, 52] . Since the binding of CTCF to genome-wide CBS elements is not static but rather dynamic [9, 10] and there is variable permeability of CTCF extrusion barriers [20] , this suggests that cohesin slides through the proximal CTCF sites within tandem CBS arrays to more distal sites (Fig. 5n) . Curiously, our computational simulation in silico and genetic deletion in vivo revealed that tandem-arrayed CBS elements ensure balanced usage of associated promoters in specific and equal spatial chromatin contacts in general. Thus, our data on Pcdh, \u03b2-globin, and Igh clusters suggest that directional CTCF chromatin looping between convergent CBS elements underlies insulator function and that tandem CTCF sites ensure balanced promoter spatial accessibility in the 3D genome folding and regulation. However, since there are numerous gene clusters and hundreds of thousands CTCF sites in mammalian genomes, whether all tandem CTCF sites function in a similar manner in vivo waits further studies.",

The collagenase was neutralized by adding an excess amount of Neurobasal Medium. A single-cell suspension was made by gentle pipetting and then filtered through 100-\u03bcm cell strainers (BD Biosciences). For HEC-1-B cells, trypsin was added to the culture dish, and the single cells were suspended in the culture medium. Single cells were then picked under the microscope by using a microcapillary pipette into the thin-walled PCR tube containing 2 \u03bcl of cell lysis buffer, 1 \u03bcl of oligo-dT primer, and 1 \u03bcl of dNTP mix. After reverse transcription, the cDNA was pre-amplified by PCR. The cDNA library was then purified, tagmented, and ligated with adapters using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina FC-131-1096). Finally, the adapter-ligated fragments were further amplified by PCR and purified with AMPure XP beads (Beckman).

In the regular 4C, the size of the viewpoint fragments should be at least 200 bp to allow for efficient self-circulating in the second ligation step. In addition, there must be at least one restriction enzyme cutting site within the viewpoint fragment to allow for self-circulation. By contrast, the only requirement for viewpoint selections in QHR-4C is the matching of a linearized amplification primer. Second, the regular 4C could not detect chromatin interactions of the fragments that do not contain the second restriction enzyme cutting site. However, QHR-4C, which does not require the second digestion step, is able to detect these chromatin interactions and allows for better coverage of genomic regions of interests. Third, since the ends of the captured DNA fragments are generated by sonication, the captured dsDNA ends are random and unique, and thus can be used as an identifier for quantifying the long-range chromatin interactions.

After ligation, free adapters were removed by washing the beads twice with the B/W buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl, 1 M NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). The DNA on beads was resuspended in 10 \u03bcl water. Finally, the QHR-4C libraries were generated by one-step PCR amplification (94\u00b0C, 2 min; 94\u00b0C, 10 s; 60\u00b0C, 15 s; 72\u00b0C, 1 min for 19 cycles; and a final extension at 72\u00b0C, 5 min) with captured DNA on beads as the template and a pair of PCR primers. The forward primer matches the Illumina P5 and the viewpoint sequence adjacent to the DpnII site with barcodes, and the reverse primer matches Illumina P7 with indexes (primer sequences are listed at Additional file 2: Table S1 ). The PCR products were purified with a PCR purification kit (Qiagen). About 100 QHR-4C libraries with different combinations of barcodes and indexes were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform. All of the QHR-4C experiments for each CRISPR clone and CRISPR mouse lines were performed with two biological replicates.",

In addition, the cohesin ring cannot pass through each other during extrusion. Finally, CBS can block cohesin sliding in an orientation-dependent manner [11, 18, 19] . The concepts of cohesin separation and processivity are introduced to characterize loop extrusion [19, 20] . Accordingly, cohesin separation is the mean distance between consecutive sliding cohesin complexes on a chromatin fiber, and cohesin processivity \u03bb is the mean size of the extruded loops. Specifically, for L bins and separation d, the number of cohesins on the Pcdh locus is calculated as \u230aL/d\u230b. The initial locations of these cohesins are determined according to the loading probabilities inferred from the NIPBL ChIP-seq data. Both heads of a cohesin either occupy the same bin or two adjacent bins with a probability of 0.5 for each. Different cohesins cannot occupy the same bin. At each step, a cohesin may drop off from the chromatin fiber or polymer with the probability 2/\u03bb, where \u03bb is the processivity. If one cohesin drops off, a new one will be immediately loaded to the polymer according to the loading probabilities from the NIPBL ChIP-seq data but avoiding existing ones. This keeps the number of cohesin complexes unchanged for the Pcdh locus. Finally, both \"heads\" of a cohesin complex can extrude through a bin if it is unoccupied by CTCF or another cohesin.",

The dynamic binding of CTCF to oriented CTCF sites provides hindrance for cohesin sliding [9, 10, 56, 57] . In this scenario, the permeability is calculated as follows. If there are n consecutive CTCF sites c 1 , c 2 , \u22ef, c n , from distal to proximal, with a permeability of p 1 , p 2 , \u22ef, p n , respectively, we want to know the mean attempting times x n for cohesin ring to slide through the entire CBS array from proximal to distal. For the first attempt, the proximal CBS has a probability p n to allow cohesin ring to pass through. Thus, the cohesin needs x n \u2212 1 attempting times on average to slide through the remaining CBS array c 1 , c 2 , \u22ef, c n \u2212 1 . Otherwise, the proximal CBS c n has the probability (1 \u2212 p n ) to block cohesin ring passing through. Thus, one attempting time has been used and cohesin still needs x n attempting times on average to slide through the entire CBS array c 1 , c 2 , \u22ef, c n . In summary:",

In multiple-cell experiments, only the mean of macroscopic variables over an ensemble of microstates can be observed. As an inverse problem, inferring the distribution of microstates from the macroscopic variables can be achieved in two different ways. The first is the maximum entropy approach. One searches for the best in all microstate distributions which coincide with the observed macroscopic variables, and choose the distribution with the maximum entropy. The justification for this is that one should introduce as little information as possible other than that from the direct observation. The second is the model-based simulation. One sets up a computation model, such as the cohesin loop extrusion, and simulates many microstates. The difficulty comes from the parameter choice. Generally, novel methods are used to optimize parameters by minimizing the differences between the macroscopic variables calculated from the simulated microstates and those observed from experiments.

The disadvantage is that it abandons all known central mechanisms, such as the cohesin loop extrusion. On the contrary, the model-based simulation includes known mechanisms to set up the model but predicts the macroscopic variables usually deviating from the observations. We use the relative maximum entropy approach [83] that combines the advantages of both the maximum entropy approach and the model-based simulations. The basic idea is quite similar to the maximum entropy approach. One searches the best in all microstate distributions which coincide with the observed macroscopic variables. The difference is that the distribution with the maximum entropy relative to that determined by the underlying model, namely the relative entropy instead of the entropy, is chosen. The entropy is actually the relative entropy to the uniform distribution, which is the least informative distribution. If an underlying model is set up based on new information, then the least informative distribution will be determined by the underlying model. The relative entropy, or the negative Kullback-Leibler divergence, is a measurement of the similarity between two distributions. The relative maximum entropy approach actually selects a distribution closest to the least informative one among those satisfying the experimental observations. We apply the relative maximum entropy approach [83] to correct polymer simulations by the rescaled QHR-4C data. Pairs with 0 contact frequencies in both replicates are excluded. In simulations, long-distance chromatin interactions between the bin of viewpoint and all other bins are determined by their spatial distances in the 3D conformation and the capture radius \u2102 (the distance at which two monomers are determined to be in contact).",

In our case, each instance is a promoter, which has four factors: the enhancer strength, the insulator strength, the loop strength, and the promoter activity. Bayesian networks are a non-cyclic directed graph which uses nodes to represent factors and arrows to connect them. The networks are learned by maximizing the posterior likelihood. An arrow from the insulator strength to the promoter activity means it is a direct dependence. We analyzed 207,663 enhancerpromoter contacts of the capture Hi-C data for the genome-wide relationship between insulators, enhancers, and promoters [46] . For each bait promoter fragment, containing a promoter whose activity is represented by the expression level f i , with starting chromosomal coordinate s i and terminating coordinate t i , we denote it by [s i , t i ]. It forms long-distance chromatin contacts, measured as loop counts l ij in the capture Hi-C experiments, with a putative enhancer fragment [s j , t j ]. The enhancer strength e j of the fragment [s j , t j ] is defined as its total H3K27ac signals from ChIP-seq experiments. The insulator strength u ij of the loop is defined as the total CTCF ChIP signals in the interval [min(t i , t j ) + a, max(s i , s j ) \u2212 a] (a = 500 bp to exclude the rare cases that promoters or enhancers themselves contain CTCF binding sites) if min(t i , t j ) + a \u2264 max(s i , s j ) \u2212 a, and zero otherwise. Let . Finally, we use the ranking of the above variables on day 0, day 3, and day 6 to discrete them.
