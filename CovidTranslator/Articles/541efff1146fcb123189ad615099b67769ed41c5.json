The aim of this study was to understand behaviors and risk perceptions associated with bat conservation, exposure to bats and their excreta, and bat consumption. Sixty-seven respondents playing various roles in bat guano mining, packaging, sale, and use as fertilizer participated in the study. Data were collected through interviews and/or focus group discussions. Results: In spite of a bat conservation program dating back to the 1980s, the benefits of conserving bats and the risks associated with bat consumption were not clear and infrequently articulated by study respondents. Discussion: Since bat consumption continues, albeit covertly, the risk of bat-borne diseases remains high. There is an opportunity to reduce the risk of bat-borne diseases in guano-mining communities by strengthening bat conservation efforts and raising awareness of the health risks of bat consumption. Further research is suggested to test behavior change strategies for reducing bat consumption.",

Bat guano is a very rich fertilizer, primarily due to its high nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus content (16) . In Thailand, guano produced by the microbat Tadarida plicata, the wrinkle-lipped freetailed bat, is favored for its rich organic content. It is the most abundant bat in Thailand, lives in 17 caves across the country, and is insectivorous (12) .

Mid-sized bats are illegally trapped and sold in the community. Nonspecific cave bats, bats caught in nets at the mango or red cotton flower fields, and the flying fox bat were among the bat types secretly caught as an illegal food source. In addition to bat meat, respondents reported that bat blood is occasionally consumed as a health supplement in the community, as it is said to be useful for treating asthma in children (especially if the blood is taken from a bat's ear or wing), curing other unnamed illnesses, or increasing strength.",

The most common bats consumed are fruit bats that become caught in nets placed over fruit trees or sugar palms. Small bats are also occasionally eaten. Bats that fall from after flying into power lines can be legally consumed and are often made into a spicy bat soup or stir fry. Bat blood is occasionally consumed and is considered to be an aphrodisiac.",

Recent legislation makes it illegal to trap or eat bats in Thailand. Currently, the Royal Forest Department discourages the trapping and eating of bats by levying steep fines. The fines were noted in all of the communities we studied. The benefits of conserving bats and the risks associated with bat consumption, however, were infrequently articulated by the study respondents, indicating that illegality was the greatest deterrent to trapping and eating bats, not concerns about animal conservation or health risk reasons. However, several studies presented relevant evidences that bat consumption might be risky for bat-borne diseases (10, 14, 17) . Aside from direct consumption, the transmission of disease from bats to people in Bangladesh is through the contamination of raw date palm sap by bats. Presumably, the transmission to humans occurs through the consumption of food contaminated with bat saliva or urine, and the infection of domestic animals (cattle, pigs, and goats) (18) .",
