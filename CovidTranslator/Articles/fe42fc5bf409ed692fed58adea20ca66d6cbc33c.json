Central factors involve the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus stimulates release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary. Interstitial endocrine cells have LH receptors that, when coupled with LH, produce testosterone. Testosterone is essential for spermatogenesis and several other testicular functions; Sertoli cells, germinal cells, and myoid cells have androgen receptors, but the contribution of testosterone for the function of germinal cells and myoid cells is not known. Testosterone is known to inhibit apoptosis of germ cells. FSH directly stimulates the Sertoli cells and perhaps the germinal cells. FSH and testosterone probably act synergistically. FSH action on Sertoli cells results in release of the hormones estrogen, inhibin, and activin. Estrogen is important in the function of other cells and spermatogenesis. Inhibin and activin are members of the transforming growth factor (TGF) superfamily. Inhibin enters the blood stream and inhibits FSH production, whereas activin stimulates FSH production. Both also have local effects and are part of the paracrine-autocrine system. Sertoli cells also produce anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH, previously known as M\u00fcllerian inhibitory substance [MIS] ) during development but usually not in adults.",

When all steps occur normally, sex chromosome genotypic, gonadal, and phenotypic sex is matched. Male domesticated mammals normally have an XY genotype, although XX males can occur if a sexdetermining factor is present. SF1 is a gene activated at the beginning of the sex determination period in both males and females, but it reduces in amount dramatically at the end of the sex determination period in males. It is also involved in the development of adrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary axis. In normal XY males, SRY, the gene that is the sex-determining region of the Y chromosome, encodes a transcription factor that contains a high mobility group (HMG)-box DNA binding domain. This binds to specific DNA sequences, causes bending of the DNA and results in Sertoli cell differentiation. WT1+KTS, GATA4 and FOG2 are part of the transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation of SRY. SRY, the product of SRY, regulates transcription by binding to promoter sites of SRY-like HMG-box protein 9 (SOX9). SOX9 also has 2 transcriptional activation domains that act on the testis determining pathway. M33 (Cbx2) and ATRX are involved in gonadal development. SRY, M33, and ATRX either activate testis-determining genes or inhibit pro-ovarian genes.",

Most assume the testis must be lower in temperature but the epididymis also may operate better when cooler. The maturation of spermatozoa is a slow process and the epididymis is one long and coiled tube. The testicular artery is long and coiled, and changes the blood flow from pulsatile and high pressure to a constant low-pressure system.

They leave the testis via the rete testis and enter the efferent ductules. The efferent ductules number between 13 and 20, depending on the species. Most join the single duct of the epididymis, but it is common in most species for one or more to end blindly. The epididymis is long and tortuous, and divided into many distinct areas. For this discussion, 3 main areas will be referred to: the head, body, and tail. The tail terminates in the deferent duct. Disease of one area has effects on other regions. Pathologists often examine the testes or biopsies of individual animals rather than whole groups of animals. Gross and histologic assessment of reproductive tissues is a valuable tool if used appropriately. Complete definition of a clinical problem often requires collaboration of the cytogeneticist, endocrinologist, theriogenologist, and pathologist, who alone may not be able to determine the complete pathogenesis. For the pathologist to function optimally, appropriate samples must be collected and processed. For many of the diseases and the tissues, routine fixation with 10% formalin is adequate, but for peritoneal cestodiasis caused by larvae of Mesocestoides spp. may involve the vaginal tunics, with saccular dilations within the tunics, thickening of the spermatic cord, and pyogranulomatous inflammation involving the testicular capsule and extending into the testes. There is also a report of pentastome larvae of Porocephalus crotali within the testicular capsule of a dog.",

Mesotheliomas with primary involvement of the vaginal tunic occur in the dog and bull (Fig. 5-11 ). Extension of the tumor into the peritoneal cavity has been observed in the dog. Ultrastructural study or immunohistochemistry is necessary to differentiate mesotheliomas from metastatic adenocarcinoma. The origin of intrascrotal mesothelioma from the paramesonephric duct remnant is suggested. There is a report of a lipoma occupying the right scrotal cavity in a ram, causing compression of, but apparently not directly involving, the testis. loop that begins and ends at the mediastinum, and turns completely at the testicular capsule. In ruminants, the testes are oriented in a dorsoventral plane, the stallion has a more craniocaudal orientation, the dog is oblique, and the boar and cat are inverted oblique. The basic microscopic appearance is similar-the testis is divided into the interstitial (extratubular) or intertubular compartment and the seminiferous tubular compartment. The interstitial endocrine cells are the major resident of the intertubular compartment; macrophages are another important cell type. In the boar, the interstitial endocrine cells are particularly prominent and numerous . In young horses, there are lipofuscin-containing macrophages in the interstitium, remnants of gonadal atrophy of the fetal gonad ( Fig. 5-14) . The normal tubular diameter is 270 \u00b5m in the bull, 146 \u00b5m in the stallion, 180 \u00b5m in the dog, and 236 \u00b5m in the boar. It is normal to see spermatogenic arrest in some seminiferous tubules in some species. a detailed assessment of spermatogenesis, or the histologic appearance of seminiferous tubules, rapid fixation after death or collection (within minutes in many species) in Bouin's, Zenker's, or Davidson's fluid, with paraffin embedding, is necessary. Plastic embedding is the method of choice for a detailed assessment of the spermatogenic cycle.

The testes of boars become progressively brown with age, and are brown if degenerate. A frequent misdiagnosis is made in equine fetal and neonatal gonads. Fetal testes undergo hypertrophy because of hyperplasia of the interstitial endocrine cells as they produce precursors for placental hormones. These cells and testicular macrophages contain lipochrome pigments that are especially noticeable during the atrophic stage that occurs prior to birth. Many a practitioner and pathologist are fooled by the apparent brown discoloration of the testicular parenchyma of the neonatal equine testis (Fig. 5-12 ).

Taking a random sample of any part of the testis is adequate for generalized disease; however, such a sample may not be representative of the entire testicular parenchyma. There is species and individual variability in the part of the testis initially affected by degenerative processes, including variations between the dorsal and ventral parts of the ruminant testis, variations between seminiferous tubules, and along the length of individual seminiferous tubules. Sampling of the testis to maximize the number of seminiferous tubules examined should be at right angles to the direction of the tubules. In general, the seminiferous tubules run at right angles to the mediastinum. Each forms a normal location. In postpubertal animals, the testes are smaller than their normal scrotal counterparts (see Fig 5- 3) and often have a \"Sertoli cell only\" pattern (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) . This is because of the deleterious effect of normal body temperature on spermatogenesis. In older animals, degenerative changes such as interstitial fibrosis and thickening of basement membranes are superimposed on the immature appearance. In extreme forms, the outlines of distorted basement membranes are in fibrous tissue (see Fig. 5-15 ). Hyperplastic foci of Sertoli cells occur in some retained testes, and these may be sites of development of Sertoli cell tumors (see Fig. 5 -17). In unilateral testicular maldescent, which is typical, the contralateral testis is hypertrophied (see Fig. 5 -3).",

Although it is a frequent clinical finding, little is known of the mechanism and features of the condition. The association between testicular neoplasia and testicular maldescent is well recognized. Sertoli cell tumors are the most common, especially in abdominally retained testes. Seminomas are the second most common neoplasm, and they occur mostly in inguinally retained testes. Miniature Schnauzers with persistent M\u00fcllerian duct syndrome (PMDS) often have unilateral or bilateral testicular maldescent. Testicular torsion usually involves cryptorchid testes-especially if there is a concomitant testicular neoplasm . Other diseases linked to retained testes are patellar subluxation, hip dysplasia, penile and preputial defects, and umbilical and inguinal hernias. Dogs are more likely to have retention of the right testis-perhaps because of a longer pathway for descent of that testis, or a less well-defined gubernaculum on the right. Inguinal testes predominate over intra-abdominal. Testicular neoplasms-Sertoli cell tumor and seminomaare more prevalent in the right side also. Descent is usually complete by 3 months of age in the dog. Hormonal studies suggest that LH is lower in cryptorchid dogs, and the cryptorchid testis mediates the inhibition of LH secretion. As with other species, cryptorchidism could indicate a sex chromosome DSD (see previous section, Disorders of sexual development).",

The small size is because of a reduction in the amount of seminiferous epithelium, thus there are fewer Sertoli cells, spermatogonia, spermatocytes, elongated spermatids, and spermatozoa. An affected testis is grossly similar to a normal prepubertal testis in almost every way (see Fig. 5 -4). Studies of hypoplasia are mostly observational at the clinical, gross, or microscopic level. Evaluation of mutant mice has aided the study of pathogenesis, mostly by identifying the effects of lack of cytokines and growth factors. Research indicates there is an alteration of control of spermatogenesis, so there are many similarities with testicular degeneration (see later).

The substance of the testis is a darker color that is often brown . The epididymis is usually less affected than the testis and will appear disproportionately large. With continued degeneration and fibrosis, the testis becomes increasingly hard and tough (see Fig. 5 -25). Spermiostasis in parts of individual seminiferous tubules is identified as white linear regions, especially at the mediastinum, and these may mineralize (see Fig. 5 -27). Continued germinal cells, and eventually, loss of even the resistant Sertoli cells (see Fig. 5 -28).

Once-only scrotal heating can cause the appearance of spermatid giant cells in degenerate testes and perhaps in the semen. Two types of giant cells, mononuclear giant cells probably derived from pachytene spermatocytes that fail to differentiate further, and multinucleated cells, considered to be derived from coalescence of identical spermatids, are observed histologically. Even extremely brief heating, of several minutes only, induces giant cell formation. Such giant cells are seen as early as 6 hours and as late as 7 weeks post-heating, but they seem to be most prevalent at about 1 week. The fate of these cells is unclear. They may disintegrate or pass out of the testis.

Preputial epithelial cytology changes so that more superficial epithelial cells are seen. Affected animals return to normal after removal of the neoplasm. Not all dogs will have a raised serum estrogen concentration. Inhibin secretion by the neoplastic Sertoli cells inhibits the secretion of FSH and LH by the pituitary, which in turn inhibits testosterone production and presumably alters the ratio of estrogen to testosterone.

The earliest development of the tumor is intratubular and even in some large examples, intratubular growth is still evident elsewhere (Fig. 5-45A) . Rupture of the tubules soon occurs and the growth becomes confluent, forming broad sheets of closely packed cells with scant supporting stroma. The cells are large and round or polyhedral, with a rim of visible cytoplasm that may be basophilic or eosinophilic (Fig.  5-45B ). The nuclei are large, round, and hyperchromatic, with one or more large acidophilic nucleoli. In some tumors, the nuclei are larger and vesicular but still regular in shape. In many seminomas, it is possible to find scattered mono-or multinucleated giant cells with abundant granular acidophilic cytoplasm. A useful distinguishing feature is the presence of focal nodules of, or diffuse, CD8+ lymphocytes. Whereas degeneration of tubules at the edge of the tumor is normally contribute to a tubular pattern, and the neoplastic cells tend to palisade. In smaller tubules they stretch from one side of the tubule to the other (Fig. 5-43B ). Some form cystic structures that may be confused with carcinoma. In the welldifferentiated tumors, the cells resemble normal Sertoli cells, being elongate with foamy acidophilic cytoplasm and small, basally located, nuclei. In less differentiated varieties, the cells are still elongate, have eosinophilic cytoplasm, but the nuclei are oval and pleomorphic, and are no longer basally located against the trabecular pole. In the less common form of the tumor, the cells show little or no tendency to palisade but are discrete and spherical with well-defined eosinophilic cytoplasm and anisokaryosis. Mitoses are sparse in most. Lipids are demonstrable in the neoplastic cells as large droplets and globules in more differentiated tumors, and as fine droplets in the least differentiated tumors.

Large ones are, because of their size and the reduced ability of the animal to raise the testis to maintain thermoregulation, or because of alteration of blood flow and changed testicular oxidant/antioxidant balance. The pathogenesis of varicocele is poorly understood. In humans, the left unilateral location is the result of altered hemodynamics from insertion of the testicular vein to the renal vein rather than directly to the vena cava. Evidence in humans with varicose veins of the legs suggests that the elastic properties of the walls of the veins, arterial flow, and valves in veins are major factors. It is difficult to implicate intimal sclerosis of the spermatic vessels as older animals of all species develop this, but so few develop varicocele.",

The inflammation is segmental and may spare large portions, or is multifocal and coalescing. The prostatic epithelium varies from hyperplastic columnar cells with prominent eosinophilic globules in the apical cytoplasm of individual acinar cells to atrophic where they are cuboidal or squamous in type, and the apical cytoplasm loses eosinophilic staining. Focal squamous metaplasia occurs, and may be mistaken for prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. The lumina of the glands contain a variable number of neutrophils and macrophages, and debris. The interstitium has lymphocytes and plasma cells and aggregates of lymphocytes; true lymphoid follicles are common. Fibrosis is variable; often some regions have extensive fibrosis such that the interstitium has a larger area than acini. Dogs with clinical prostatitis are often treated with antibiotics and neutering-the latter results in superimposition of physiologic prostatic atrophy on the effects of fibrosis and chronic cellular reaction. have a sterile content and are devoid of pus, urine, and spermatozoa. Hyperplastic prostatic and paraprostatic cysts are partially lined by prostatic epithelium, and probably arise as outpouching of prostatic glandular epithelium through the discontinuous muscle coat of the gland. Cysts that are centrally located on the dorsal surface of the prostate may have arisen from vestiges of the paramesonephric duct, and form a uterus masculinus. Uterus masculinus occurs in males of most species, and they are in the connective tissue between the ampullae or deferent ducts (Fig. 5-51) .",

Persistent penile frenulum is reported in the bull, boar, buck, dog, and tomcat.

Vascular defects of the penis that cause failure of erection are studied in the bull and boar, but their precise diagnosis antemortem or postmortem requires injection of contrast material and radiography, or injection of plastic into vessels to form casts. Vascular shunts from the cavernosum to the spongiosum of the penis or to peripenile vasculature prevent effective erection.

In many cases, yellow-red nodules up to \u223c8 mm in diameter may subsequently appear on the penis especially near the urethral orifice. These later transform to shallow ulcers, which after healing may leave distinct nonpigmented foci on the skin of the penis, prepuce, scrotum, and perineum. In cutaneous habronemiasis (for detailed discussion, see Vol. 1, Integumentary system) the lesions may affect the penis, especially around the urethral meatus, and or the preputial mucosa at about the point of its contact with the end of the retracted penis. The lesions are elevated, ulcerated, and bleed; they consist of exuberant fibrous tissue enclosing few or many larvae of Habronema spp. and may be sufficiently large to cause paraphimosis. There are large numbers of eosinophils that form small eosinophilic \"abscesses\" around immobilized and dead larvae; they correlate to small yellow foci on the cut surface. The lesion develops during the summer months. These larvae often infect squamous cell carcinomas, so lesions should be examined for neoplasia. Nodules in the prepuce of the stallion are also caused by adults, larvae, and ova of Halicephalobus spp., or by mycotic infection, particularly pythiosis. Geldings develop a nonspecific posthitis with accumulation of smegma and detritus, presumably because of reduced penile extrusion.",
