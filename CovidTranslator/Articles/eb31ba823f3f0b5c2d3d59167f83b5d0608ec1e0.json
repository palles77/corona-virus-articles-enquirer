            "text": "At least 58 viruses have been reported to infect grapevines causing economic damage globally. Conventional detection strategies based on serological assays, biological indexing and RT-PCR targeting one or few viruses in each assay are widely used. Grapevines are prone to contain mixed infections of several viruses, making the use of these techniques time-consuming. A 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray able to detect simultaneously a broad spectrum of known viruses as well as new viruses by cross-hybridization to highly conserved probes is reported in the present study. The array contains 570 unique probes designed against highly conserved and species-specific regions of 44 plant viral genomes. In addition probes designed against plant housekeeping genes are also included. By using a random primed RT-PCR amplification strategy of grapevine double stranded RNA-enriched samples, viral agents were detected in single and mixed infections. The microarray accuracy to detect 10 grapevine viruses was compared with RT-PCR yielding consistent results. For this purpose, grapevine samples containing single or mixed infections of Grapevine leafroll-associated virus-1, -2, -3, -4, -7, -9, Grapevine fanleaf virus, Grapevine rupestris stem pitting-associated virus, Grapevine virus A, and Grapevine virus B were used. Genomic libraries containing complete viral genomes were also used as part of the validation process. The specific probe hybridization pattern obtained from each virus makes this approach a powerful tool for high throughput plant certification purposes and also for virus discovery if the new viral genomic sequences have partial similarity with the microarray probes. Three Closteroviridae members (Grapevine leafrollassociated virus -4, -7 and -9) were detected for the first time in Chilean grapevines using the microarray.",

Viruses affect negatively plant vigor and longevity, as well as the quality and quantity of the yield. Grapevine is one of the oldest horticultural crops widely grown in temperate climates and represents a highly valuable agricultural commodity. There are more than 70 infectious agents including viruses, viroids and phytoplasmas that have been reported in grapevines.

Nevertheless they have limitations such as the restricted number of viruses detectable in a single assay. Furthermore the user needs to have a preconceived idea of what virus to screen for, limiting the possibilities to detect new or divergent species. Infected grapevine samples are complex biological matrices which may contain several pathogens, making these techniques time-consuming and labor intensive. Serological based detection systems have to rely on the quality of the antisera available to detect different strains that in addition, are constantly evolving. Furthermore, some commercial antisera are strain-specific, limiting the detection to certain geographical regions.",

First, the most highly conserved sequences within each viral family were chosen to maximize the spectrum of detectable viruses including new viruses that may cross-react with conserved probes if the viral family of the novel member is represented. This was done after BLASTN alignment of all the viral species of a given family using total or partial genomic sequences available as described previously (Wang et al., 2002) . The second approach was aimed at designing more species-specific sequences not necessarily conserved at the family level. The goal was to discriminate the viral agent at the genus or species level when possible, depending on the amount of sequences available for each virus. In this case the BLASTN alignment considered all the sequences available for each viral species to identify conserved regions among different isolates of the same virus. The feasibility of using long unmodified oligonucleotides as detection probes has been widely demonstrated (Bozdech et al., 2003; Chou et al., 2004; Hughes et al., 2001) . Initial validation of the probes performance was done by hybridizing GLRaV-3 or GFLV Cy3 labeled genomic libraries and uninfected samples as described below.",

These libraries were labeled with Cy3 and hybridized to the microarray. The GLRaV-3-labeled library (sample L2 in Fig. 2A ) coupled specifically to most of the spots designed against GLRaV-3 present in the array. The Cy3 hybridization intensity for each spot was plotted as a red linear scale when intensity was above threshold and as a black stripe when Cy3 intensity was below the threshold. \"Vector\" probes indicate the presence of plasmid in the sample and \"23S\"correspond to probes hybridizing to the grapevine 23S ribosomal gene. The 13 samples correspond to infected grapevines (samples 1-6, 8-11), uninfected grapevine (sample 7) and GFLV and GLRaV-3 genomic libraries (samples L1 and L2). (B) Virus specific RT-PCR analysis in agarose gels for each of the grapevine samples detailed above(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of the article.). Similar results were obtained when a GFLV library (sample L1 in Fig. 2A ) was utilized. In this case all the GFLV spots printed bound to the GFLV library while 4 additional spots against ArMV (Arabis mosaic virus) hybridized also with this library. Samples L1 and 04 (Fig. 2B) were not infected with ArMV according to PCR analysis. ArMV the Nepovirus related most closely to GFLV, gave the expected genus cross-hybridization pattern since GFLV and ArMV share approximately 70% of the genome nucleotide identity. These Table 1 Oligonucleotides used for the detection of GLRaV-1, ArMV, GVA, GVB, GFLV and results indicate that at the genus level, the libraries contained viral sequences belonging to the Ampelovirus and Nepovirus genera, while at the species level, the results demonstrate the presence of GFLV and GLRaV-3, thus confirming the suitability of the probe design and selectivity of the hybridization protocol. Notably, the observed cross-hybridization suggests that unreported members of the Nepovirus family may be detected also in plant samples. Two additional probes included in the microarray were used to confirm the presence of plasmid vectors in samples L1 and L2 ( Fig. 2A) .",

The procedure detected the presence of 10 grapevine viruses belonging to three different families (Closteroviridae, Comoviridae and Flexiviridae). Two of the samples (samples 9 and 10) showed mixed infection of GLRaV-2, GRSPaV and GVA, sample 1 showed mixed infection of GLRaV-1 and GVA and sample 3 was infected with GLRaV-1, GLRaV-7 and GVA.

Simultaneous multi detection systems like the one presented here are highly desirable, especially to analyze plant diseases caused by multiple viruses. In fact, grapevine plants are prone to contain several co-infecting viruses, demonstrating the value of having a simultaneous detection system. The microarray developed in this study contains probes designed against species-specific regions, to discriminate between closely related genus members, and against highly conserved regions at the family level, to enable detection of highly divergent viruses or even previously unidentified viruses. The possibility to detect unknown viruses has been validated widely with this approach, especially for novel human or animal viruses (Chiu et al., 2007; Mihindukulasuriya et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2003a) and it has an advantage over conventional detection techniques where the user needs to have a preconceived idea of what to screen for. Thus, in this work a total of 570 unique probes were designed and printed in duplicates to target grapevine viruses (Table S1 and Fig. S1 ). 70mer oligonucleotides combine specificity and versatility since they are able to bind divergent viral templates without the need to have a perfect sequence match, while at the same time they discriminate between related viral species (Bozdech et al., 2003; Chou et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2003b) .",

This was confirmed by using Cy3 labeled GLRaV-3 and GFLV libraries that gave the expected strong Cy3 signal intensities with the respective viral species probes and with some probes of closely related virus such as ArMV in the case of GFLV ( Fig. 2A samples 4 and L1) .

To overcome sensitivity issues due to the fact that plant viruses are distributed randomly with low titers in plant tissues, samples were amplified using a random primed PCR protocol prior to the hybridization step. In addition, to maximize the virus/host RNA ratio, dsRNA enriched samples were used as templates instead of total RNA. Previous results indicate that detection of plant viruses from grapevine total RNA or dsRNA without an amplification process raises the possibility of obtaining false negative results and diminishes the efficiency and sensitivity of the detection method (data not shown). In conclusion, randomly amplified dsRNA-enriched samples overcome these limitations by lowering the host RNA background and increasing the amount of viral DNA available for hybridization, hence maximizing the chances of detecting viruses independently of the viral titer present in the sample. This is particularly important during the summer season when the titer of some grapevine viruses is lower. Notably, this approach allows processing of small amounts of plant tissue in order to obtain reproducible results since less than 1 g of plant tissue was enough to proceed with the RT-PCR and hybridization steps.",

Importantly, 3 of the 10 viruses reported (GLRaV-4, GLRaV-7, GLRaV-9) were previously detected for the first time in Chile due to the microarray hybridization signatures obtained, confirming their presence in local samples (Engel et al., 2008a; Escobar et al., 2008) . It is important to mention that occasional cross-hybridization was obtained between some GLRaV-4 and GLRaV-9 probes, suggesting that these viruses could be different strains of the same species rather than two different members. The taxonomic status of GLRaV-4, GLRaV-5, GLRaV-6 and GLRaV-9 is currently under study and might suffer modifications in the future (Martelli, 2009) .",

Having probes available against different genomic regions is another advantage over PCR methodology, where primers often target only one specific region of the viral genomes. Since microarrays are very easy to upgrade, a new version with additional probes against recently completed or newly described viral genomes is currently being developed in our laboratory. The microarray based format is flexible, robust, easy to upgrade, and has the potential to increase detection throughput while reducing simultaneously the cost per unit (Martin et al., 2000) .",

Since glass planar microarrays can easily fit 30,000 probes, it is realistic to think of a large generic plant virus microarray. In this case, more than 20 different probes could be printed against each of the 1200 plant viruses currently described. Considering that Chile is among the main fruit exporters worldwide, a generic plant virus microarray for high throughput detection and certification purposes is highly desirable.",
