Earlier studies based on susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation and susceptible-infected-recovered-dead models revealed the number of potentially infected cases and the basic reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 3, 8, 9 .

We decided to collect data (initially from Jan 21 to Feb 10, 2020) in several typical regions of China, including the center of the outbreak (i.e. Wuhan City and Hubei Province), other four most affected provinces (i.e., Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan, Hunan) and top-4 major cities in China (i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen). During data analysis on Feb 13, 2020, the number of new confirmed cases on Feb 12 in Hubei Province and Wuhan City suddenly increased by 14840 and 13436, respectively, of which 13332 and 12364 are those confirmed by clinical features (note: all the number of confirmed cases released by Feb 12 were counted according to the result of viral nucleic acid detection rather than by referring to clinical features). We thus arbitrarily distributed these suddenly added cases to the reported cumulative number of confirmed cases from Jan 21 to Feb 14 for Hubei Province by a fixed factor (refer to Table S1), assuming that they were linearly accumulative in those days. It is the same forth with the data for Wuhan City.",

However, there is a tendency to miss-report some positive cases such that the reported numbers represent a lower limit. One typical example indicating this uncertainty is the sudden increase of more than 14 000 new confirmed cases in Hubei Province on Feb 12 after clinical features were officially accepted as a standard for infection confirmation. Another uncertainty might result from insufficient kits for viral nucleic acid detection at the early stage of the outbreak. We thus examined the effects of such uncertainty using a Monte Carlo method (for detail, refer to the Methods section in SI file). For simplicity, we assumed that the relative uncertainty of the reported data follows a single-sided normal distribution with a mean of 1.0 and a standard deviation of 10%.",

Note: the reported cumulative number of confirmed cases of Hubei Province and Wuhan City were re-adjusted for data fitting due to the suddenly added cases by clinical features (for detail, refer to Table S1). (B) Plots of the cumulative number of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 as of Feb 14, 2020, in the most affected provinces (Guangdong, \u25a0; Zhejiang, \u25a1; Henan, \u25b2; Hunan, \u25b3), with the simulation results being plotted as color lines. (C, D) Data of mainland China (panel C) and Hubei Province (panel D) were fitted to the Boltzmann function assuming that the relative uncertainty of the data follows a single-sided normal distribution with a mean of 1.0 and a standard deviation of 10%. Original data are shown as circles; simulated results are presented as colored lines as indicated. Inserts show key statistics. The key date is defined as the date when the number of daily new confirmed cases is less than 0.1% of the potential total number. The low and high key dates were determined by the simulated curve of confidence interval (CI) at 2.5% and 97.5%, respectively. (E, F) The cumulative number of confirmed cases of 2003 SARS in China (panel E) and worldwide (panel F) are shown as black squares, and the simulation results are plotted as red short lines and parameters of each established function are shown in inserts.",
