The earliest patients in Wuhan are related to exposure from a seafood market. Later, the number of patients grows drastically due to human-to-human transmission [3] . The incubation period of COVID-19 is reported to be 3-7 days, at most 14 days, which varies greatly among patients [2] . The novel coronavirus is believed to be infectious during incubation period when no symptoms are shown on the patients [4] , an important characteristics differentiating COVID-19 from its close relative SARS. Considerable measures have been implemented to control the outbreak in Wuhan and China, mainly by quarantine to reduce transmission. On Jan 23rd, 2019, Wuhan restricted travel outside the city. Any person exposed to COVID-19 is required to perform a self-isolation for 14 days. Around Jan 25rd, 2019, nucleic acid kit was developed to diagnose the patients. On Feb 12th, 2020, clinical diagnosis was used to assist the confirmation of infection in Hubei province. Nonetheless, has spread to all provinces of China and more than 30 other countries in the last two months [5, 6] .",

Firstly, COVID-19 has a relatively long incubation period, which causes a time delay between real dynamic and the dailyobserved case numbers. Secondly, the epidemic trend heavily depends on multiple artificial factors, including local medical resources, quarantine measures, and the efficiency of confirmation approaches, which should be explicitly modeled. For example, the outbreak is more severe in Wuhan compared to other cities in China that constrains the medical resources, therefore the infected need a longer time to be confirmed and reported in the official released numbers. This potentially leads to a larger difference between real and reported infected cases in Wuhan than in other places.",

SUQC distinguishes the infected individuals to be un-quarantined, quarantined but not confirmed, and confirmed. Among the three types, the confirmed number is the data we can directly observe from the official released report. Only un-quarantined infected have ability to infect susceptible individuals and affect the development of the epidemic. In our proposed model, the quarantine rate parameter is used to quantify the strength of quarantine policy on the development of epidemics, and the confirmation rate parameter is used to measure the efficiency of confirmation based on the released data.",
