The membrane-spanning portion of an integral membrane protein contains a relatively large number of hydrophobic amino acids, which is often reflected in the total amino acid composition of the protein . The percentage of large hydrophobic amino acids can be considered as an indication of the hydrophobicity of a protein [ 71 . This percentage is 20 .2% in an average protein (from 314 families of proteins [8] and an average of 30 .3% in a number of membrane proteins (Table 1) . However, the size of the protein is also important, since the hydrophobicity of a small part of the protein may be compensated for by a relatively large number of hydrophilic amino acids in externally located regions of the larger integral membrane proteins. This is shown in number of receptor proteins are given . These integral membrane proteins are generally larger than those listed in Table 1 and have an average of 24 .3% of large hydrophobic amino acids . Nevertheless, these integral membrane receptor proteins also contain strongly hydrophobic regions, which may result in aggregation and in difficulties during purification . The methodology needed to purify integral membrane proteins by column liquid chromatography, in particular by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), is the subject of this paper .",

The critical micelle concentration (CMC) is the concentration of monomer at which micelles, i .e. spherical bilayer aggregates of detergent molecules, begin to form . Triton X-100 has a low CMC, 0 .24-0 .30 mM, and is difficult to remove by dialysis . Octylglucoside has a high CMC, 25 mM, and can easily be removed by dialysis . Therefore, further studies to be carried out with the membrane protein may determine the choice of detergent . Some studies require a soluble protein-detergent complex in order to maintain biological activity, in which case Triton would be preferable . Complete removal of detergent generally leads to precipitation of the membrane protein . Some non-ionic detergents (Berol, Nonidet, Triton, Emulgen, Renex) absorb UV light and therefore interfere with the spectrophotometric determination of proteins at 280 run . Removal of unbound detergent or exchange of one detergent for another has been reviewed by Furth et al . [ 23, 24 ] .

This detergent separates into an aqueous phase and a detergent phase at 30` C, and integral membrane proteins were preferentially found in the detergent phase while hydrophilic proteins showed up in the aqueous phase . This procedure was successfully applied to a number of proteins : El glycoprotein of a corona virus [30] ; E2 protein of Semliki Forest virus [31] ; G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus [32] ; rat intestinal brush border membrane proteins [33] ; major surface protein of Leishmania [34] . However, two well characterized integral membrane proteins, the acetylcholine receptor [35] and the T8 antigen of human T lymphocytes [36] , failed to partition into the detergent phase . Parish et al . [ 37 ] recently developed a more versatile version of this prepurification technique . They used ammonium sulphate to facilitate entry of integral membrane proteins into the detergent phase . Since addition of ammonium sulphate lowers the cloud point to physiologically acceptable temperatures, this also had the advantage that the procedure could be extended to several other detergents, including the more commonly used Triton X-100 . Six murine lymphocyte surface molecules partitioned into the Triton X-100 phase from 33-50% ammonium sulphate saturation .",

These percentages would probably be different if membrane protein purification alone were considered . In the purification of receptor proteins, BAC is often the major purification step . Viral membrane proteins are often purified by immuno-BAC, and quite a number of other membrane proteins have been purified by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) .

This difference also shows the importance of the size of the protein, since they have an almost similar percentage of large hydrophobic amino acids (29 .7 and 30.3% leucine, isoleucine, valine, methionine, LfVM ) . The two larger Sendai virus membrane proteins were eluted as multiple peaks at higher organic solvent concentrations, between 44 .5 and 52 .5%, (Fig. 1, HN , dotted area ; F1, hatched area) . The multiple peaks may be caused by repeated precipitation and dissolution of the larger membrane proteins. Chromatography of the non-reduced extract [7] showed that the proteins in this extract, F (65 kD) and the dimer and tetramer of HN (136 and 272 kD, respectively), could be eluted but that no separation was obtained . Again precipitation and dissolution may have been the principal cause of the broad peaks that were eluted at similar organic solvent concentrations (ca . 50%) .

At an equal percentage of hydrophobic residues, the organic solvent concentration necessary for protein desorption will increase with protein size . Thus, if conservation of biological activity is not crucial, a reduction of protein size generally will enhance protein recovery and separation efficiency. Unfortunately, the applicability of RP columns for membrane proteins is not predictable from the performance with simple water-soluble reference proteins . In a recent study [ 94 ] we evaluated several RP-HPLC column materials, differing with respect to bonded ligands, pore size and particle size, for the purification of membrane proteins . Despite the fact that four selected columns performed equally well with hydrophilic proteins, large differences in protein recovery were observed when Sendai virus membrane proteins were applied to these columns . For instance, recovery of the M protein, which ranged from 0 to 50%, was found to be dependent both on the solvent system [ 0 .1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water-acetonitrile or 12 mM hydrochloric acid in water-ethanol-n-butanol (4:1) ] and on the column material in an interdependent way. It appeared that the optimal solvent system for the purification of these membrane proteins depended on the RP material and was different for each protein . Therefore, to find the best conditions for the purification of a particular membrane protein, one should preferably evaluate a few different solvent systems with an exploratory set of different RP materials .",

The use of solvents of higher eluotropic strength, e .g. 1-or 2-propanol instead of acetonitrile, results in the elution of proteins at lower organic solvent concentrations, while it increases both resolution and recoveries [ 25, 27, 95 ] . Mixed organic phases are also advantageous for this purpose . The inner-core proteins and the envelope proteins of murine leukemia virus [ 96 ] were purified with a gradient of acetonitrile at 23 \u00b0 C during the first part of the separation followed by a gradient of 1-propanol at 50\u00b0C in the final part. Recovery of the viral proteins was nearly quantitative . Also, improved chromatographic results were obtained with large peptides of cytochrome P-450 [97] and the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor [58] , flavivirus proteins [43] and Sendai virus membrane proteins [25, 94] by elution with acetonitrile-propanol or butanol-ethanol . These improvements are ascribed to the fact that the increase in eluent strength is greater than the increase of the denaturing and precipitating effects of mixed organic phases [95 ] . Substitution of TFA by less hydrophobic ionic modifiers such as phosphoric acid or hydrochloric acid, will generally reduce protein retention as well [ 25, 95, 98 ] . Also, high concentrations of formic acid (up to 60%) have been used for RPC of membrane proteins and polio virus capsid proteins [ 97, [99] [100] [101] . Although short exposure appears not to be harmful [97, 1011, prolonged contact with high concentrations of formic acid may result in esterification of Ser and Thr residues or in cleavage at Asp-Pro bonds . Tables 4-7 are of direct medical importance, e .g. proteins from blood platelet membranes or erythrocytes [51, 59, 62, 64 ] . Leishmania [ 34] are protozoan parasites responsible for a variety of diseases affecting humans and other mammals . Receptor proteins such as the EGF receptor [72] and the PDGF receptor [58] mediate various cellular responses . They possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, which is stimulated by binding of the hormone to the receptor . Furthermore they are structurally related to oncogenes . Other receptor proteins play an important role in viral pathogenesis . Viruses attach to these receptor proteins on the surface of cells in the initial stage of the infection process, e .g. the rhinovirus receptor [ 901 and the adenovirus attachment protein [91 ] . Viral membrane proteins often play a crucial role in stimulating the defence mechanism of the infected host . Many of these proteins have been purified by BAC ( Table 6) .",

HPLC has become a versatile tool in the isolation of proteins as well as in the detection of proteins for analytical purposes . Trace amounts of protein present in relatively large volumes of complex mixtures can be concentrated and separated by gradient elution on IE or RP columns [ 104 ] . Thus this technique would be very useful for the purification of biologically important proteins present in bulk biological samples . However, with the commonly used standard HPLC columns, the sensitivity of UV detection is limited both by the low protein concentration during elution and by baseline disturbances caused by solvent peaks . The low mass recovery on these columns with nanogram or even microgram amounts of protein, especially with the more hydrophobic proteins, is another limiting factor .",

However, to maintain the same resolution, the gradient time has to be increased [ 105 ] , which may further reduce the recovery of the proteins [ 106 ] . Therefore, to obtain smaller peak volumes and a higher detection sensitivity, alternative solutions are required, such as the use of microbore columns (1-2 mm I.D . ) . Under conditions of isocratic elution, the peak volume is directly related to column length and decreases with the square of the column diameter [ 107 ] . Under gradient elution conditions these relationships are rather similar but more complex [ 108 ] . At first sight, the small sample volume that can be applied to microbore columns to avoid extra-column band broadening might seem a limitation . However, this is only true for isocratic systems . When gradient systems are employed for protein elution, the effect of sample volume on band broadening is totally insignificant. Under appropriate initial solvent conditions the proteins are strongly retained and are concentrated on top of the column [ 108, 109] . For the same reason, conventional gradient HPLC equipment can be used, although the volume of the line on the upstream side of the column should be kept as low as possible to avoid long dwell-times . In addition, peak volume may be further reduced by a reduction of column length, which also has a beneficial effect on the recovery of hydrophobic proteins [110] . In fact, the use of short microbore columns employing flow-rates of 0 .1-0 .2 ml/min has enabled trace enrichment from large sample volumes (more than 2 .0 ml) resulting in subse- Because of the small peak volume that can be obtained, the method was used to concentrate proteins and peptides from diluted solutions or from minced slices of polyacrylamide gels prior to analysis [ 109, 111, 112 ] , and for instance allows direct transfer to gas-phase sequencers . Thus, as an advantageous side-effect of the small elution volumes obtainable with microbore chromatography, losses due to handling of proteins at the nanogram or microgram level after elution are reduced . Such losses occurring in concentrating methods are often due to nonspecific adsorption .",

The immunoglobulin G (IgG) fraction of a rabbit anti-peptide antiserum was isolated and coupled to Sepharose 4B . A detergent extract of polyoma virus-infected cells was incubated with the anti-peptide Sepharose beads . The medium T antigen was eluted by 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 0.15 M sodium chloride, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0 .1% SDS, 1% trasylol, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM magnesium chloride and 10,ug of peptide (per 100,ul of cell extract) . A large amount of anti-peptide antibodies (25 ,ug) was necessary for the isolation of less than 0.005 ag of medium T antigen. This suggests that anti-peptide antibodies, in comparison with monoclonal and polyvalent antibodies, do bind rather inefficiently to the antigens. Addition to the elution buffer of the combination of detergents, as well as the 30-fold excess of peptide (of the peptide binding capacity of the column), was necessary to achieve an optimal release of the medium T antigen .",

Proteins produced in this way, especially those produced in prokaryotes, may be insoluble or present in an aggregated form. The purification of eukaryotic polypeptides synthesized in E. coli is the subject of a recent review [115] , and it was shown that the problems associated with the purification of this class of proteins are largely similar to those encountered in the purification of integral membrane proteins. Shire et al. [ 71 ] developed a procedure to purify foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) VPI surface antigen expressed as a fusion protein from E. coli. E. coli contaminants had to be removed, since they affected the chromatography and had a deleterious effect on the immunogenicity of the VP1-fusion protein . The VP1-fusion protein, obtained as a pellet, was dissolved in 7 M guanidine hydrochloride containing 0 .1% 2-mercaptoethanol and 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7 .0) and subjected to gel permeation chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 in the same buffer . The fractions containing the 31-kD VP1fusion protein were dialysed against 8 M urea and 14 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 8 .5) containing 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol (urea-Tris buffer) . Subsequent chromatography on DE-52 gave 97% pure VP1-fusion protein with almost quantitative recovery in the flow-through fraction, and the E. coli contaminants were eluted with a 0 .0-0 .2 M sodium chloride gradient in urea-Tris buffer . The purified VP1fusion protein appeared to be immunogenic . Direct chromatography on DE-52, without the preceding gel permeation step in guanidine hydrochloride, was not possible since 8 M urea failed to eliminate interactions between the VP1-fusion protein and E.coli contaminants. Complexes of these proteins were eluted unseparated by a sodium chloride gradient from the anion-exchange matrix . Guanidine hydrochloride (7 M) was shown to be effective in disrupting the interaction between certain E. coli proteins and the VP1-fusion protein, allowing their separation by gel permeation chromatography or prolonged high-speed centrifugation (12 h, 44 000 g) .",

To purify the Px fusion protein, the following procedures were used. Pellets of bacterial cell lysates containing the expressed fusion protein were solubilized in 7 M guanidine hydrochloride, Tris-HCl (pH 7 .5) with 2 mM DTT, dialysed against 7 M urea, loaded onto a TSK-DEAE column and eluted with a salt gradient . Alternatively, this protein was purified by RP-HPLC on a C3 column. The 7 M guanidine hydrochloride extract was dialyzed against 5 M guanidine hydrochloride, made 0 .1% in TFA and applied to a C 3 column. The Pi fusion protein (molecular mass 15 kD) was eluted with an acetonitrile gradient in 0 .1% TFA as a sharp peak at 32% acetonitrile, free from contaminants with molecular masses ranging from 30 to 100 kD . These examples show that after solubilization, bacterially expressed fusion proteins can be purified by chromatographic methods . Such proteins may also retain immunoreactive epitopes. The Px fusion protein was used to detect antibodies against the gene product (p42) of HTLV-I in sera of individuals who have adult T-cell leukemia or are asymptomatic carriers of the virus [ 117 J . 6 . CONCLUSIONS At present, a wide variety of HPLC systems for purification of integral membrane proteins is available . The choice for a particular system or combination of systems will largely depend on the protein to be purified and on whether an intact protein is required for further studies.",

They consist of a bilayer of phospholipid molecules in which proteins are embedded . These integral membrane proteins, which cross the bilayer once or several times, generally have a higher than ayerage hydrophobicity and tend to aggregate. Detergents are needed to remove integral membrane proteins from the lipid bilayer and they have to be present during further chromatographic purification . Predominantly, four modes of HPLC have been used alone or in combination for the purification of integral membrane proteins . These are based on differences of proteins in size (size-exclusion chromatography, SEC), electrostatic interaction (ion-exchange chromatography, IEC ), bioaffinity (bioaffinity chromatography, BAC) and hydrophobic interaction (reversed-phase chromatography, RPC, and hydrophobic-interaction chromatography, HIC) . SEC, IEC, BAC and HIC are used under relatively mild conditions, and buffer systems generally contain a non-ionic detergent . RPC generally has a denaturing effect on the protein and should preferably be used for the purification of integral membrane proteins smaller than 50 kD .",
