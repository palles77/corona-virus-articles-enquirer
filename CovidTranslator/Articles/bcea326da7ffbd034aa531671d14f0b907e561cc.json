These amphibians had been injected with the choanomastigotes of C. fusciculutu, a trypanosomatid flagellate. The parasites were chosen because of their ease of culture under laboratory conditions and more importantly because of their presence in the blood and alimentary canal of ranid anurans under natural conditions (Smyth & Smyth, 1980) . To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of the use of an immunoenzyme method to detect antibodies in amphibians. Furthermore, there are no previous data concerning anti-parasite antibody detection in amphibian serum. MATERIALS AND METHODS Injecrion und serrr. Before injection of the parasites. a small sample of blood was taken by cardiac puncture from each of the toads and inspected for any current infection (with naturally-occurring trypanosomatid flagellates) by smear, wet mount preparation and slope culture as described elsewhere (Ingram & Molyneux, 1983a. b ). In addition. blood smears were also examined by an immunoenzyme method reported previously by Ingram and Molyneux (1 Y84b, c) but using a rabbit anti-C., firscic~tkctcr serum/swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins antiserum/ peroxidase-rabbit antiperoxidase/amino-ethylcarbazole substrate system.

Significant correlations (P < 0.0 1) were obtained for both control (range 4Y-76%) and immune sera (83-Y2%) when the DA titres were compared to the values found for the other methods. Although DA is simple to perform, preconditions of the test include antigen-type specificity, the non-immobilization and non-autoagglutination of parasites and usually the use of living cells. In the current study, loss of cell motility was observed in some instances and the possibility of inclusion of nonviable cells in others cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless caution must be taken in the interpretation of natural 'antibody' levels in view of the detection of 'antibodies' in normal BVS against L. hertigi and T. brucei with titres within the range found for C. fuscicdata. Positive results for normal BVS would suggest the presence of low amounts of specific immunoglobulins induced by a current infection with or previous exposure to C. fasciculata parasites. However, the low levels of naturally-occurring 'antibodies' in normal BVS may also have been stimulated by the environmental presence of micro-organisms or other trypanosomatid flagellates which non-specifically cross react with shared cell wall carbohydrate antigenic determinants (Andrews, Reilly, Ferris & Hanson, 1965; Schnaidman, Yoshida, Gorin & Travassos, 1986; Sharabi & Gilboa-Garber, 1980 ). In the present study, the low levels of 'antibody' in sera from the control groups are not likely to be caused by a current infection because no increase in titres were found throughout the 1 O-week duration of the experiment.",

Grids possesses an efficient immune system responsible for the rapid elimination of antigen. Therefore it was not possible in the work reported here to correlate the level of parasitaemia and antibody titres. However the exposure of B. Grids to C. fasciculata evoked a specific immune response and resulted in significantly increased levels of serum antibody. Under normal environmental situations, it is feasible that naturally-occurring immunoglobulins in BVS restrict parasite numbers to below a potential infectious threshold. The finding of serum antibody titres above those of normal background levels in amphibians or other animal hosts in similar habitats or areas endemic for certain diseases would indicate current infection with parasites, other infectious agents or pathogens within a population.",

As with DA cross reactivity can often lead to false positive results. When the results obtained by CFT were compared with each other and with IHA and ELISA, the lowest range of correlations, although significant and similar to those determined for the DA comparisons, were found for control BVS (50-77%; IgM which is an efficient complement fixer and also a good agglutinin (Atwell & Marchalonis, 1976; Yamaguchi.
