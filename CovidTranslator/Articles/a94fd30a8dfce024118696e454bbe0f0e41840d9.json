[1] [2] [3] At the end of May 2019, there were a total of 2428 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS with 838 associated deaths (case-fatality rate: 34.5%, which is higher than the fatality rate of SARS) worldwide according to World Health Organization (WHO) statistics. 4 MERS cases have been reported in 27 countries, including countries in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America as well as Australia, and case numbers continue to increase, posing a global threat to public health. In China, the first patient infected with MERS-CoV from South Korea was diagnosed in May 2015, 5 and it will be extremely important to prevent, control, and treat MERS-CoV infections during any future outbreaks.",

Sanders et al showed that virus droplets were deposited and concentrated in the lungs through the respiratory tract of mice inoculated intranasally, resulting in fast disease onset. 29, 30 Correspondingly, after instillation infection with MERS-CoV, we found that mice with a short airway and high concentration of virus deposited in the lungs displayed weight loss at day 1 and lung lesions at day 3, consistent with intranasal mouse models established by Adam, Agrawal and Li et al [31] [32] [33] ; these mice also exhibited 0% survival by day 5. Previous studies reported that aerosol particles \u22645 \u03bcm penetrated the respiratory tract to reach the alveoli and were diffusely distributed in the lungs. 30, 34 In addition, virus aerosols entered the blood circulation through the alveoli, and other viruses slowly replicated in the lungs after mice inhaled MERS-CoV-containing aerosols (particle size: 1.27 \u00b1 0.61 \u03bcm). Compared with instillation-inoculated mice with virus deposition in the lungs, aerosol-exposed mice displayed slower disease progression with an incubation period of 5-7 days, lung lesions on day 7, continuous weight loss on days 7-11, milder clinical signs, and 60% survival on day 11.",

A relatively high viral load in the lower respiratory tract is associated with severe illness in viral respiratory diseases. 36, 37 At 3-5 days postinfection, mice in the intranasal group, which had high viral loads in the lungs and brain at 3-5 days, exhibited acute interstitial pneumonia and pathological brain changes. In the aerosol group, mice developed acute interstitial pneumonia at 3-9 days and pathological brain changes at 7-9 days, which were caused by high levels of virus RNA in the lungs at 3-9 days and in the brain at 7-9 days, respectively. Higher virus RNA levels in the instillation group might contribute to the more severe High level on days 3 and 5",

MERS-CoV binds to hDPP4 receptors that are primarily expressed in the lower respiratory tract and alveoli, resulting in a wide range of disease symptoms in patients, from no symptoms to mild respiratory illness or severe acute pneumonia, which rapidly progresses to acute lung damage, multiorgan failure and even death. 42, 43 Clinically, chest radiography and chest computed tomography (CT) show no lung lesions in patients in the early stages of illness, but pneumonia is identified during the course of the disease and includes patchy densities, extensive diffuse and focal alveolar space opacities, interstitial infiltrates, and consolidation. 44 pulmonary pathological changes in aerosol-infected mice were similar to those noted in patients with respiratory tract infection.",

Overall, aerosol-infected mice developed slower progressions of disease, viral replication, and lung lesions, and milder symptoms than intranasally infected mice. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection was associated with significant induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which substantially contributed to severe pneumonia. 38,39 According to the results of clinical studies and previous reports on MERS-CoV animal models, we assayed the levels of eight cytokines and chemokines: IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, and CXCL-1 by ELISA. Clinical studies have shown that markedly increased levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 are detected in patients with severe MERS. 38,40 Previous reports have indicated elevated levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and CXCL-1 in MERS-CoV animal models. 6,25,32,33 Additionally, we found that the concentrations of these cytokines and chemokines were markedly elevated in the lungs and brain of aerosol-and instillation-infected mice. The induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs plays an important role in tissue immunopathological changes and fatal pneumonia. An elevated pulmonary viral load and its injurious effects on the pulmonary system are likely responsible for the increased inflammatory response. It is possible that the relatively robust pulmonary inflammatory response in mice may have promoted MERS-CoV replication, causing increased pulmonary viral loads in the mice.36",

As observed by necropsy, aerosol-infected mice developed lung lesions at 7-9 days, but no lung lesions occurred within the incubation period, and subsequent histopathology identified mild-to-moderate diffuse interstitial pneumonia without severe histopathology at 3-9 days, which almost matched the progressive moderate pneumonia observed in MERS patients. However, instillation-inoculated mice showed a shorter incubation period (1 day postinfection) and failed to stimulate the progression of mild-tomoderate pneumonia due to the acute disease course.
