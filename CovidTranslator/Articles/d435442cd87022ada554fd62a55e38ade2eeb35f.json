This development requires better understanding of populations of immunocompetent cells, their activities and their soluble products. Considerable progress has been made in the understanding of bovine systemic responses, including phenotypes of T cell subsets (Grewal et al., 1978; Baldwin et al., 1986; Splitter and Eskra, 1986) , alloreactivity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells , and their IL-2 responsiveness (Miller-Edge and Splitter, 1984; Carter et al., 1986; Fong and Doyle, 1986; Picha and Baker, 1986) . However, little is known about populations of lymphocytes isolated from the bovine gut. By analogy with murine systems (Nencioni et al., 1983; Carman et al., 1986) , the mucosal immune response can be expected to play an important role in defense against a variety of bacterial, helmintic and viral pathogens of cattle which invade or colonize mucosal surfaces.",

Techniques similar to those used to obtain cells from the murine gut were adapted to the isolation of lymphocytes from bovine gut epithelium and lamina propria. B lymphocytes from both compartments were identified by the presence of surface immunoglobulin. Cytoplasmic immunoglobulin was used as a marker for antibody-producing plasma cells. Mitogenic responses and proliferation upon stimulation with the T cell mitogen, Con A, anti-bovine immunoglobulin, bovine Con A supernatants, and recombinant human IL-2 were assessed. The results show that, as in rodent species, differences are apparent in bovine lym-phocYte populations from the two compartments. The Con A mitogenic response of bovine gut epithelial lymphocytes is similar to that observed for porcine IEL and contrasts to that reported for murine IEL. Finally, bovine LP and IEL, like bovine peripheral blood lymphocytes, are very sensitive to rhIL-2 stimulation, suggesting that this lymphokine is involved in the regulation of the mucosal immune response in this species.",

A minimal proliferative response was observed following in vitro treatment of IEL with 0-20 ttg/ml anti-Ig (Fig. 1 ) , suggesting that the majority of these lymphocytes do not express sIg. The magnitude of the IEL proliferative response to anti-Ig directly correlated with the number of sIg + cells observed by immunofluorescence. In experiments in which there were higher numbers of sIg + cells in the IEL population, probably due to the presence of LP lymphocytes, larger proliferative responses were seen. Cultures of LP lymphocytes stimulated with the same concentration of anti-Ig did proliferate, incorporating approximately 40 000 c.p.m, of 3H-thymidine/ 5 \u00d7 10 ~ cells in an 18-24-h period (Fig. 1) .

Therefore, functional characteristics of bovine gut cells were assessed. One such characteristic is the ability of cells bearing sIg to proliferate in response to soluble anti-immunoglobulin (Boyd et al., 1985) . According to these authors, approximately 40% of murine splenic B cells incorporate 3H-thymidine following anti-Ig stimulation, while T cells and non-lymphoid cells do not respond (Boyd et al., 1986) . In the present experiments, LP but not IEL responded to anti-Ig. This finding was in agreement with the immunofluorescence data which showed few sIg + cells in the IEL population. IEL from different animal species respond differently to T cell mitogens. Guinea pig (Arnaud-Battandier and Nelson, 1982) and pig (Wilson et al., 1986a) IEL proliferate well following Con A stimulation, with maximal proliferation of swine cells occurring at a Con A concentration of 10 zg/ml. Mouse IEL respond only marginally to Con A treatment (Dillon and MacDonald, 1984) while IEL from the rat large intestine reportedly do not respond at all (Nauss et al., 1984 ) . Maximal proliferation of bovine IEL occurred at a Con A concentration of 1-5 ]~g/ml, or 2-10-fold less than the optimal concentration reported for porcine IEL (Wilson et al., 1986a) , although this apparent difference in sensitivity may be due to different culture conditions. Bovine LP lymphocytes, like those from the other species documented in the literature (Arnaud-Battandier and Nelson, 1982; Greenwood et al., 1983; Nauss et al., 1984) , proliferated when stimulated with Con A.",

In addition to other lymphokines, Con A supernatants are known to contain IL-2, and IL-2 has been shown to act across species. More recently, rhIL-2 has been shown to stimulate bovine and porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells to divide (Fong and Doyle, 1986) . The present experiments demonstrate that rhIL-2 can enhance the proliferative responses of lymphocytes from the epithelium and LP of the bovine gut. However, the ability of gut lymphocytes to produce IL-2 in vitro, as has been shown for human (Greenwood et al., 1983) , murine (Arnaud-Battandier and Nelson, 1982; Nauss et al., 1984) and porcine (Wilson et al., 1986b) LP has yet to be determined.",

It is clear from these studies that populations of bovine LP lymphocytes and IEL, like those from other species, differ with respect to both phenotypic and functional characteristics. In addition, bovine lymphocytes from these compartments share some characteristics of gut cells from other species. Finally, bovine IEL and LP lymphocytes are now known to be sensitive to lymphokines which have been shown to regulate systemic responses. Using this in vitro system, studies are in progress to determine if the subsets of bovine gut cells, now defined by parameters of Con A and lymphokine sensitivity, have cytotoxic and natural killer activities which have been shown for subsets of gut lymphocytes from other species.",
