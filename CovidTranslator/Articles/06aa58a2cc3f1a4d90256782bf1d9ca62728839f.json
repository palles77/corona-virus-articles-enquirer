            "text": "The Vaccine Research Center has developed vaccine candidates for different diseases/infectious agents (including HIV-1, Ebola, and Marburg viruses) built on an adenovirus vector platform, based on adenovirus type 5 or 35. To support clinical development of each vaccine candidate, pre-clinical studies were performed in rabbits to determine where in the body they biodistribute and how rapidly they clear, and to screen for potential toxicities (intrinsic and immunotoxicities). The vaccines biodistribute only to spleen, liver (Ad5 only), and/or iliac lymph node (Ad35 only) and otherwise remain in the site of injection muscle and overlying subcutis. Though \u223c10 11 viral particles were inoculated, already by Day 9, all but 10 3 to 10 5 genome copies per \u03bcg of DNA had cleared from the injection site muscle. By three months, the adenovector was cleared with, at most, a few animals retaining a small number of copies in the injection site, spleen (Ad5), or iliac lymph node (Ad35). This pattern of limited biodistribution and extensive clearance is consistent regardless of differences in adenovector type (Ad5 or 35), manufacturer's construct and production methods, or gene-insert. Repeated dose toxicology studies identified treatment-related toxicities confined primarily to the sites of injection, in certain clinical pathology parameters, and in body temperatures (Ad5 vectors) and food consumption immediately post-inoculation. Systemic reactogenicity and reactogenicity at the sites of injection demonstrated reversibility. These data demonstrate the safety and suitability for investigational human use of Ad5 or Ad35 adenovector-based vaccine candidates at doses of up to 2 \u00d7 10 11 given intramuscularly to prevent various infectious diseases.",

Initial candidates were based on adenovirus type 5 (Ad5); however, newer pre-clinical and clinical candidates are based on alternative adenovirus serotypes, such as Ad35, or on chimeric constructs designed with the intention of circumventing the high degree of pre-existing immunity to Ad5 in the human population, should this factor or other safety issues prove to reduce the utility of the Ad5 vectors currently in clinical testing (Thorner et al., 2006) . This novel product class represents a unique regulatory challenge. In order to advance pre-clinical candidates forward into the clinic, pre-clinical safety evaluations need to be conducted to determine where in the body the adenovectors would biodistribute after intramuscular inoculation (in order to identify potential target organs for toxicity) and whether any toxicological effects could be identified. Such effects might either be as a direct (intrinsic) toxicity from the adenovectors or as immunotoxicity resulting from the host immune response to the vaccine insert or adenovector antigens (for a brief discussion about vaccine-induced immunotoxicity, see Sheets et al., 2006b) .",

These can include local reactions at the site of injection, such as pain, tenderness, erythema, or induration, or systemic reactions, such as fever, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, headache, nausea, vomiting, inappetence, etc. Reactogenicity is often the consequence of intended or unintended immune responses and inflammation induced by the vaccine. Vaccines by and large are safe, as they must be, given that they are administered to healthy individuals to prevent a potential future disease. Most of the side effects seen with vaccines are of this typical type of local and systemic reactogenicity. Thus, preclinical safety assessments of vaccine candidates to support their clinical investigation must address the types and severity of reactogenicity that is expected with vaccines as well as identify any potential safety signals that might be unusual to a particular vaccine candidate.",

            "text": "Rabbits were chosen as the test model for these studies as they are a species large enough to receive a full human dose of vaccine. This is important since the immunogenicity and/or pharmaceutical effect of vaccines does not scale directly to body weight or body surface area, as may be the case for most drugs that disseminate through the blood to other parts of the body. Vaccines act at the local site of injection (if delivered parenterally) to induce an immune response that traffics systemically. Thus, delivery of a full human dose to the animal model is deemed the most suitable means of addressing potential human toxicities (CBER, 2006; Chang et al., 2007) . Based on current clinical experience with Ad5 vectors as vaccine candidates, rabbits appear to be a good predictor of the reactogenicity that is being observed in the clinic (Catanzaro et al., 2006) . For Ad35, there are not yet sufficient clinical data to validate the rabbit as the appropriate animal model. However, Ad35 as a vaccine vector for tuberculosis and malaria entered clinical trials in late 2006 (Crucell, 2006a (Crucell, , 2006b , so these data will be forthcoming. In addition, the Ad35 vaccine described herein has also entered clinical trials (GenVec, 2007) . While Ad5 (a subgroup C Adenovirus) primarily enters cells by binding to the Coxsackie and Adenovirus receptor (CAR), Ad35 (a subgroup B Adenovirus) utilizes CD46 (membrane cofactor protein) as a receptor. The tissue distribution of CD46 expression is reported for a small number of species, but has not yet been elucidated for rabbits. Further, it should be noted that this is not the appropriate animal model for HIV disease or AIDS. Nor is it the appropriate model to assess the effect vaccination might have on subsequent acquisition of HIV (or appropriate model, such as SIV) or disease, as would be assessed in a challengeprotection model. The studies undertaken as reported herein were not intended to model HIV acquisition or disease progression in vaccinated animals, only to assess acute or sub-acute intrinsic toxicities and immunotoxicities, as recommended by regulatory authorities, specifically, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has regulatory jurisdiction over the clinical trials we have proposed or performed with these investigational vaccines.",

These candidate vaccines are intended for use in prevention of diseases caused by viruses including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1), Ebola, and Marburg. Inoculation of adenovectors with gene-inserts encoding HIV-1, Ebola, or Marburg proteins results in the in vivo expression of the viral antigens. Strong antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses are thus induced (Sullivan et al., 2000; Catanzaro et al., 2006; Sullivan et al., 2006; Sun et al., 2006, unpublished data) . In order to provide preclinical data to support the safety and suitability of the candidate vaccines to proceed into human clinical testing, three biodistribution studies and four repeated dose toxicology studies were performed on the four adenovector-based vaccine products that will be described herein. In addition, two of the repeated dose toxicology studies reported were performed delivering the adenovector as a boost to a DNA plasmid vaccine prime. The biodistribution and safety of DNA plasmid vaccines were separately demonstrated and previously reported (Sheets et al., 2006a (Sheets et al., , 2006b . The methods and study designs reported herein are quite similar to those performed on the DNA plasmid vaccines. The primary difference between the earlier studies and these are that the DNA plasmid vaccines do not biodistribute outside the injection site and primarily result in local reactions. However, like the adenovectors, the biodistribution and toxicology profiles seem to reflect the platform (DNA plasmids or adenovectors) rather than the gene-inserts being expressed.",

Duplicate wells received the rabbit sera dilutions and were then incubated 2 hr at 37\u00b0C; after washing and removal of non-adherent materials, each well received (and was incubated with) biotin-labeled anti-rabbit (IgG/IgA/IgM) (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. After this period, each well was washed and then received (and was incubated with) streptavidin-HRPO (horseradish peroxidase) for 30 min at room temperature; after washing, each well then received TMB (3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032 -tetramethylbenzidine) substrate and was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Color development was stopped by addition of 10 \u03bcl 1N sulfuric acid, and the absorbance in each well was then read within 30 min at 450 nm.",

In contrast, in the prime-boost regimen, vaccination with the DNA prime resulted in Draize scores of minimal to moderate edema and erythema increasing in frequency and severity with repeated dosing. This was a result of the combination of injection with Biojector and the active vaccination, as these observations also occurred in the control animals but to a lower amount and lesser degree. These findings were consistent with studies with DNA vaccination alone (Sheets et al., 2006b) . Boost (adenovector delivered by needle and syringe) injections did not increase the frequency or severity (minimal erythema and/or edema in a few treated animals) of the Draize observations seen at earlier timepoints (after priming doses). Local reactions were evidenced however, in that clear treatment-related (adenovector alone and prime-boost) observations were seen in gross and histopathology at the injection sites and in histopathological findings of inflammation in the perineural tissue of the sciatic nerve (near the injection site). These latter lesions consisted of chronic inflammatory cells (small macrophages and lympho-cytes) in the connective tissue around the sciatic nerve and in adjacent lymphatics and blood capillaries. This inflammation was the result of draining toward proximal lymph nodes from the distal injection sites. The injection site reactions were less in frequency and severity in the recovery sacrifice animals than in the immediate sacrifice animals for both the adenovector alone and the prime-boost regimens, demonstrating the reversibility of the injection site reactions.

This is consistent with our recent report in which we demonstrated that even when the fiber shaft of Ad5 vectors are modified to eliminate binding to the primary CAR or the secondary integrin RGD receptor or are switched with the fiber shaft of Ad35 (which utilizes CD46 as a receptor), they retain their ability to transfect, through a heparin-sensitive receptor, several dendritic cell and mononuclear cell subtypes, and they retain their pyrogenicity (Cheng et al., 2007) , inducing both adaptive immunity and toxicity (pyrogenicity).",

Thus, we conclude that liver toxicity is not occurring when adenovectors are delivered intramuscularly at doses up to 2 \u00d7 10 11 PU/VP and that the elevated cholesterol and triglycerides are simply a reflection of an inflammatory response to vaccination. Importantly, despite reports of liver toxicity when similar or higher doses of adenovectors have been delivered by routes other than the intramuscular route studied here (Harvey et al., 2002; Raper et al., 2002) , we have not noted any particular or consistent impact of vaccination on the liver -either in liver function tests, such as ALT, AST, or alkaline phosphatase, or by gross or histopathology (as discussed above).",

However, the effects were also seen with the Ebola glycoproteins into which point mutations have been introduced that abrogate cellular cytotoxicity observed in vitro and with the HIV-1 antigens (envelopes from Clades A, B, C, Clade B gag, Clade B pol). Thus, we conclude that like the other affected parameters, these effects on hemoglobin and hematocrit are related to adenovector delivery and not to the expressed trans-gene antigens. Furthermore, with regards to platelets and MPV, although in Studies D (Ad5 HIV alone and prime-boost) and E (Ebola), extremely mild thrombocytopenia was noted after the initial adenovector inoculation, and in Study E (Ebola), these mean values fell slightly outside the historical reference range, the severity was so slight that it is not likely to be clinically meaningful.",

            "text": "While it was a consistent finding that adenovector delivery intramuscularly resulted in shortened prothrombin times, shortened times are not clinically meaningful and we conclude that these results do not reflect any coagulation abnormalities. Of particular note is the consistent observation of prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). This has also been observed clinically in association with adenovirus infection or adenovector delivery (Beck et al., 1979; Jaeger et al., 1993; Malaeb et al., 2005; unpublished data) . In most of those cases, rather than an in vivo coagulation abnormality, it was found that the in vitro assay was impacted by the development of a \"lupus anti-coagulant\" or anti-phospholipid antibodies in the infected or inoculated individuals. Whether this is also happening in the case of the rabbits and the rabbit APTT assay is uncertain, but it is possible that the prolonged APTT represents a clinically benign effect of transient inflammation-induced anti-phospholipid antibody in the in vitro assay. While, adenovectors delivered intravascularly may bind to various coagulation factors (Parker et al., 2006) , there was no clinical evidence of coagulation abnormalities in our studies. Therefore, we suggest that the adenovector delivery intramuscularly is not inducing clinically-relevant coagulation abnormalities, but that the APTT assay is indirectly detecting a transient rise in anti-phospholipid antibodies that are a byproduct of the vaccine-induced inflammation and immune responses. Further, the elevated fibrinogen values that are likely a reflection of a vaccine-induced inflammatory response support this interpretation.",

Since we conclude that the toxicity is primarily related to the adenovectors rather than the expressed trans-genes that would be shared by the prime and boost, this is understandable. Further, the toxicity that is noted is essentially mild and reversible. These data suggest that toxicology studies of the individual vectors alone should be adequate to predict expected patterns of toxicity to support future uses of the same or related products in prime-boost clinical protocols without the need to delay clinical development to undertake additional toxicology studies. This can accelerate clinical development by as much as 8 months, depending on the number of primes and boosts that would be given.",

At present, there are insufficient clinical data with Ad35 vectors to validate the rabbit model; however, these data are emerging and these preliminary data are so far consistent with the preclinical findings and we take the similarities between Ad5 and Ad35 vectors in the rabbit to suggest the rabbit model is also valid for Ad35, despite the fact that it uses a different cellular receptor.",
