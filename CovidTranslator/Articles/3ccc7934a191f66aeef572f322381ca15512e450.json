The low pathogenic CoVs infect the upper respiratory tract and cause mild, cold-like respiratory illness. In contrast, highly pathogenic hCoVs such as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) predominantly infect lower airways and cause fatal pneumonia. Severe pneumonia caused by pathogenic hCoVs is often associated with rapid virus replication, massive inflammatory cell infiltration and elevated proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses resulting in acute lung injury (ALI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Recent studies in experimentally infected animal strongly suggest a crucial role for virus-induced immunopathological events in causing fatal pneumonia after hCoV infections. Here we review the current understanding of how a dysregulated immune response may cause lung immunopathology leading to deleterious clinical manifestations after pathogenic hCoV infections.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses belong to the virus family Coronaviridae and are enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses. The coronavirus genome is approximately 31 Kb, making these viruses the largest known RNA viruses [1, 2] . Coronaviruses infect a variety of host species, including humans and several other vertebrates. These viruses predominantly cause respiratory and intestinal tract infections and induce a wide range of clinical manifestations [3, 4] . Coronaviruses infecting the respiratory tract have long been recognized as significant pathogens in domestic and companion animals and as the cause of mild and severe respiratory illness in humans [4, 5] . In general, coronaviruses infecting humans can be classified into low pathogenic hCoVs, which include HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU and highly pathogenic CoVs such as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) [6, 7] . Low pathogenic hCoV infect upper airways and cause seasonal mild to moderate cold-like respiratory illnesses in healthy individuals. In contrast, the highly pathogenic hCoVs (pathogenic hCoV or hCoV hereafter) infect the lower respiratory tract and cause severe pneumonia, which sometimes leads to fatal acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), resulting in high morbidity and mortality [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

During the 2002-2003 epidemic, SARS-CoV infected approximately 8400 individuals with a 9.6% overall mortality rate [13, 14] . More recently, MERS-CoV crossed species to infect 1936 individuals resulting in 690 deaths (\u223c36% mortality rate) as of April 5, 2017 [15, 16] . Recent identification of SARS-like coronaviruses in bats and MERS-CoV in domesticated camels makes it likely that these viruses will continue to cross species barriers and cause additional outbreaks in human populations [17] [18] [19] [20] . These highly pathogenic hCoVs cause a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in humans, with a large fraction of patients developing short period of moderate clinical illness and a small but a substantial number of patients experiencing severe disease characterized by ALI and ARDS [21] [22] [23] 10] . Thus, there are basically two groups of patients, those developing milder disease, which resolved and those with severe disease, which was commonly fatal. The disease severity in pathogenic hCoV infections was also influenced by several factors such as initial viral titers in the airways and age and comorbid conditions of the infected individual. While younger individuals below 18 years experience mild-moderate clinical illness, elderly individuals exhibit worse outcomes after infection with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV [22, 10, 24] . Additionally, individuals with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, obesity, heart failure, and renal failure among others experience severe disease, particularly after MERS-CoV infection [25, 26] .",

Although there is no direct evidence for the involvement of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in lung pathology during SARS and MERS, correlative evidence from patients with severe disease suggests a role for hyper-inflammatory responses in hCoV pathogenesis. Additionally, SARS-CoV-infected airway epithelial cells (AECs) also produce large amounts of CCL3, CCL5, CCL2, and CXCL10 [43]. The delayed but excessive production of these cytokines and chemokines is thought to induce a dysregulated innate immune response to SARS-CoV infection.",

Conversely, SARS patients with severe disease had very low levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL- 10 [44] . In addition to pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, individuals with lethal SARS showed elevated levels of IFN (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (CXCL10 and CCL-2) compared to healthy controls or individuals with mild-moderate disease [48-51]. These results were the first to suggest a possible role for IFNs and ISGs in the immunopathogenesis of SARS in humans.

While MERS-CoV replicates both in na\u00efve and activated human monocyte-macrophages and DCs, only activated T cells support MERS-CoV replication [53] [54] [55] . This is in contrast to SARS-CoV, which abortively infected monocyte-macrophages, DCs, and T cells. MERS-CoV infection of THP-1 cells, a monocyte cell line, and human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells induced delayed but elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as CCL-2, CCL-3, CCL-5, IL-2, and IL-8 [54, 55]. However, induction of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 by monocytemacrophages and DCs was not substantial except for plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which produced copious amounts of IFNs upon MERS-CoV infection [56] . Recent studies showed elevated levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IFN-\u03b1) and chemokines (IL-8, CXCL-10, and CCL5) in individuals with severe MERS compared to those with mild to moderate disease [57, 58] . High serum cytokine and chemokine levels in MERS patients correlated with increased neutrophil and monocyte numbers in lungs and in the peripheral blood, suggesting a possible role for these cells in lung pathology [57, 58, 37 ].",

            "text": "Studies in animal models have been particularly useful in elucidating the role of cytokines and chemokines in mediating lung immunopathology following hCoV infections. Infection of non-human primates (NHPs) with SARS-CoV induced a dysregulated immune response resulting in increased disease severity in aged but not young NHPs, despite similar viral titers in the airways [67] . Since enhanced expression of genes regulating inflammation but not virus titers correlated with disease severity, an exaggerated immune response is thought to induce lethal disease in aged NHPs [67] . Similarly, in SARS-CoV-infected BALB/c mice, disease severity in aged mice correlated with early and disproportionately strong upregulation of ARDS-associated inflammatory gene signatures [66] . In a recent study, we identified a pathogenic role for IFN-I in mice infected with MA15. Our results showed that rapid SARS-CoV replication in BALB/c mice induced a delayed IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 response accompanied by an excessive influx of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte-macrophages (IMMs) [38] . The accumulating IMMs themselves produced additional levels of monocyte chemo-attractants such as CCL2, CCL7, and CCL12 (through IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor stimulation), resulting in further accumulation of pathogenic IMMs, which in turn enhanced disease severity. These infiltrating IMMs produced elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6, IL1-\u03b2, and iNOS. Blocking IFN signaling, depleting IMMs, or neutralizing a single inflammatory cytokine, TNF, protected mice from lethal SARS-CoV infection. Additionally, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 or IMM-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines sensitized T cells to undergo apoptosis, further impeding virus clearance [38] . In another study of SARS-CoV infection, loss of TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF), an adapter molecule for TLR3 and TLR4 signaling, resulted in a distinct inflammatory signature characterized by neutrophil and other inflammatory cell infiltration [68] . A dysregulated immune response to SARS-CoV in TRIF-deficient mice was associated with aberrant antiviral IFN (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2), pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine (IL-6, TNF, IFN-\u03b3, and CCL5), and interferonstimulated gene (RSAD2, IFIT1, and CXCL10) responses. Notably, virus titers were significantly higher in TLR3 \u2212/\u2212 and TRIF \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to their WT controls [68] . Although the viral factors regulating the pro-inflammatory response of neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages remain to be identified, the E protein of SARS-CoV has been shown to enhance pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine and inflammasome activity via its ion channel activity [69] [70] [71] .",

Marmosets with severe disease showed increased neutrophil and macrophage infiltration in alveoli and interstitial septa, although whether marmosets develop severe disease remains controversial [75, 76] .

Several hDPP4 transgenic mouse models developed thereafter exhibited variable organ tropism and disease severity, depending on the promoter driving the hDPP4 expression [79, 80] . More recently, hDPP4 knock-in mice in which hDPP4 is expressed under the mouse hDPP4 promoter have also been described. These mice also developed moderate clinical disease after infection with human isolates of MERS-CoV [81] . We and others recently developed a similar mouse model and showed that serial passage of human isolate of MERS-CoV resulted in mouse adaptation.

While nsp3 impairs IFN responses by unknown mechanism, nsp1 inhibits IFN responses by blocking STAT1 phosphorylation [90, 91] . Additionally, structural proteins such as the membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins dampen IFN signaling by inhibiting TBK1/IKKe and by unknown mechanisms, respectively [92] [93] [94] [95] . Similarly, MERS-CoV structural proteins M and N and accessory proteins orf3, orf4a, and orf4b antagonize IFN responses [85, 96, 97] . It should be noted that most if not all of these putative antiviral mechanisms were demonstrated in transient expression assays and whether they are actually important in the context of infectious virus remains to be determined. Structural and nonstructural protein antagonism of IFN responses further amplifies inflammatory responses by promoting unrestrained virus replication resulting in increased viral PAMPs that further dampen IFN signaling and stimulate PRRs to induce an aberrant inflammatory response. Lack of IFN signaling also leads to an excessive accumulation of Ly6C low monocytes and neutrophils.",

Exuberant inflammatory responses caused by pathogenic hCoV diminish the T cell response, in the case of SARS-CoV infection via TNF-mediated T cell apoptosis, thus resulting in uncontrolled inflammatory response. 3. Accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages and altered tissue homeostasis: In some SARS patients with extended duration of disease, DAD was accompanied by fibrosis of interstitial and alveolar spaces and hyperplasia of pneumocytes. Similar histological features were noticed in lungs of SARS-CoV-challenged STAT \u2212/\u2212 mice on B6 and 129 backgrounds. Lungs from these mice revealed an enhanced perivascular infiltration of alternatively activated macrophages, neutrophils, and fibroblasts accompanied by extensive fibrin deposition and alveolar collapse, features observed during end stage ALI and ARDS in humans [63, 107] . Further studies revealed that abrogation of STAT1 signaling, specifically in myeloid cells, resulted in alternative activation of macrophages [108] . In addition, a delicate balance between host coagulation and fibrinolysis processes regulates tissue remodeling and ALI [109] . 4. ARDS: Inflammatory mediators play a key role in the pathogenesis of ARDS, a primary cause of death in patients infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV [110, 111] . Several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, IL-1\u03b2, and GM-CSF, reactive oxygen species, and chemokines such as CCL2, CCL-5, IP-10, and CCL3 contribute to ARDS [48, 112, 113] . Additionally, uncontrolled epithelial cell proliferation and impaired tissue remodeling during later stages induce ARDS leading to pulmonary fibrosis and death.",

However, while some studies showed no beneficial effect, other demonstrated adverse outcomes following corticosteroid therapy during SARS-CoV infection in humans. Early treatment of corticosteroids in SARS patients enhanced plasma viral load in non-ICU patients, thus leading to exacerbated disease [118] .

In a mouse model of cardiac inflammation, systemic delivery of optimized lipid nanoparticles containing a CCR2-silencing short interfering RNA (siRNA) efficiently degraded CCR2 mRNA and impaired IMM recruitment to sites of inflammation thus resulting in improved disease outcome [129, 130] . Since hCoVs are single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses and stimulation of IMMs with the TLR7 agonist, R837 (a synthetic ssRNA mimic), induces strong inflammatory responses, it is possible that IMMspecific TLR-7 signaling promotes excessive inflammation in response to hCoV infection. Thus, a TLR7 antagonisttargeted approach to mitigate inflammation could prove beneficial.",

The inflammatory response begins with the initial recognition of a pathogen, which then mediates immune cell recruitment, eliminates pathogens, and ultimately results in tissue repair and return to homeostasis. However, certain viruses such as highly pathogenic CoVs, IAV, and ebola viruses induce excessive and prolonged cytokine/ chemokine response known as Bcytokine storms,^which results in high morbidity and mortality due to immunopathology. Although studies reviewed in this manuscript provide evidence that Bcytokine storms^and immunopathology can occur during pathogenic hCOV infections, we do not yet have a sufficient understanding of the specific factor/s responsible for exuberant inflammatory responses. Studies from human autopsies and animal models strongly suggest a pathogenic role for inflammatory cytokines/chemokines derived from IMM and neutrophils. Therefore, therapeutic interventions targeting these pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines could prove beneficial in ameliorating undesirable inflammatory responses. Additionally, since high virus titers at early and later stages of infection strongly correlate with disease severity in humans, strategies directed at controlling viral load as well as attenuating the inflammatory response might prove beneficial. Therefore, future studies should focus on identification of specific signaling pathways that mediate inflammatory responses in hCoV-infected patients and animals. (9) ",

This high replication could lead to enhanced cytopathic effects and production of higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines by infected epithelial cells[99,68, 12]. These cytokines and chemokines in turn orchestrate massive infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lungs[38]. Studies from hCoV infections in humans and experimental animals demonstrated a strong correlation between high SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV titers and disease severity.",

            "text": "Delayed IFN responses: As mentioned in previous sections, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV encode multiple structural and non-structural proteins that antagonize IFN responses. hCoV reach high titers very early after infection and harbor multiple proteins that inhibit the IFN response, suggesting that an early antagonism of the IFN response might delay or evade the innate immune response. The delayed IFN signaling further orchestrates IMM responses and sensitizes T cells to apoptosis resulting in dysregulated inflammatory response [38]. 4. Monocyte-macrophages and neutrophil accumulation: Both human and animal studies demonstrate accumulation of inflammatory monocyte-macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs following hCoV infection. These cells are the predominant source of cytokines and chemokines associated with hCoV lethal disease observed both in humans and animal models [38, 32]. Staining for SARS-CoV-N antigen in lungs of C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice at 16 and 48 h post-infection Consequences of cytokine storm and immunopathology 1. Epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis and vascular leakage: One of the earliest consequences of rapid virus replication and exuberant pro-inflammatory cytokine/ chemokine responses is lung epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis. IFN-\u03b1\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 induce inflammatory cell infiltration and cause airway and alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis via Fas-FasL-or TRAIL-DR5-dependent mechanisms [101-103]. Additionally, TNF released by IMMs also promotes the apoptosis of both lung epithelial cells and endothelial cells (unpublished observation). Apoptosis of epithelial and endothelial cells compromises lung microvascular and alveolar epithelial cell barrier resulting in vascular leakage and alveolar edema ultimately resulting in hypoxia.",
