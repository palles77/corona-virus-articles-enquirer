In this study, the safety of Nephure\u2122 was evaluated in a bacterial mutagenicity assay and in a subchronic (13-week) oral toxicity study in rats. Nephure\u2122 did not show any mutagenic properties in the mutagenicity assay. In the 13-week sub-chronic oral toxicity study in which 10 Sprague Dawley rats per sex were administered 0, 118, 235 and 475 mg/kg bw/day (8260, 16450 and 33,250 Units/kg bw/day, respectively) of Nephure\u2122 by gavage, male and female rats did not show any test article-related clinical observations or effects on body weight, body weight gain, food consumption, food efficiency, ophthalmology, functional observational battery parameters or motor activity. Furthermore, there were no changes in coagulation, clinical chemistry, urinalysis or hematology parameters, macroscopic/microscopic findings or organ weights that could be attributed to the test article. Based on these results, Nephure\u2122 was not mutagenic and the no-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) in the 13-week study was determined to be 475 mg/kg bw/day (33,250 Units/kg bw/day). Evaluation of the estimated consumption of Nephure\u2122, generation of the metabolite formate, and the current safety studies resulted in a conclusion of a tolerable upper limit of 3450 Units of OxDC activity/day (57.5 Units activity/kg bw/day), when Nephure\u2122 is added to food to decrease dietary oxalate.",

Oxalic acid-degrading bacteria have been found in feces of humans (Abratt and Reid, 2010) ; however the extent to which they degrade oxalic acid in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of humans is either unknown or inconclusive. One gut bacteria that has been investigated as a therapeutic is Oxalobacter formigenes. This organism uses oxalate as its major energy and carbon source. Anywhere from 1 to 22% of ingested oxalate is absorbed in humans, depending on source, dose and state (fed or fasting) (Noonan and Savage, 1999) . Oxalate is a known chelating agent for metal cations and dietary oxalate may form magnesium, iron or calcium salts in food or the GI tract (Asplin 2002; Israr et al. 2013) . Consequently, unabsorbed oxalate can form salts with the aforementioned minerals in the GI tract, promoting mineral excretion in feces and reducing the potential for essential mineral absorption (Noonan and Savage, 1999) .",

            "text": "Oxalate may be absorbed throughout the entire GI tract, beginning at the stomach (Hautmann, 1993; Chen et al., 2003) . The concentration of oxalate in serum of humans consuming typical Western diets is between 1 and 6 mM; much lower than the saturation concentration (Porowski et al., 2008) . However, due to water re-absorption in the kidney, oxalate concentration in urine increases over 100 times, usually in the range of 0.1e0.5 mM (Sakhaee, 2009) . Urinary calcium concentration is normally about 10 times that of oxalate concentration (Pak et al., 2004) . Therefore, urinary calcium oxalate is often supersaturated, which is usually described by the supersaturation ratio, a number being approximately the ratio of the salt concentration in the urine to its solubility. When a salt concentration in a solution is higher than its solubility, salt will start to precipitate at a certain concentration, which is called the upper limit of metastability (Coe et al., 2005) . The upper limit of calcium oxalate metastability varies with urine conditions such as other ions, macromolecules and urine pH. By reducing oxalate and/or increasing citrate intake and/or encouraging at least 2 L of urine output per year the salt concentration in urine can be kept below the upper limit of metastability; thus, allowing for normal variations of urine ion, macromolecule and pH conditions without introducing an abnormal level of calcium oxalate precipitate formation. It is believed that calcium oxalate supersaturation and lack of hydration are the drivers of calcium oxalate stone formation, although the process is complex, not completely clear and may involve several other critical factors including urinary macromolecules, bile acids and renal tubular damage (Tsujihata, 2008; Porowski et al., 2008; Coe et al., 2005; Matlaga et al., 2007; Saso et al. 2001) .",

Oxalate avoidance is difficult because oxalate is present in many different foods and levels of oxalate in a single food are variable (Holmes and Kennedy, 2000) . Therefore, it is challenging to find foods that keep oxalate ingestion low without compromising nutritional balance. Bong and coworkers recently demonstrated that calcium chloride can successfully remove a significant portion of soluble oxalate from processed spinach (Bong et al., 2017) . Herein, an enzyme approach is presented that is effective at reducing/removing both soluble and insoluble oxalate from a variety of foods and beverages.",

Food consumption was recorded weekly and food efficiency (mean daily body weight gain/mean daily food consumption) was calculated. Ophthalmologic evaluations were conducted on all animals during acclimation and just prior to test termination (Day 93). The animals were observed at least twice daily for mortality and once per day for signs of gross toxicity. Detailed clinical observations were performed daily and included changes in the skin, fur, eyes, and mucous membranes, occurrence of secretions and excretions, and autonomic activity. In addition, changes in gait, posture, and response to handling, as well as the presence of clonic or tonic movements, stereotypies, or bizarre behavior were also noted. A complete FOB was carried out during Week 11 of Nephure\u2122 administration. Rats were examined in random order with the observer not knowing what treatment groups from which the rats belonged. The FOB included numerous home cage, handling, open field and sensory observation parameters. Motor activity was also evaluated on all animals.",

There were no test material-related changes in hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis parameters. Changes in hematology were limited to increased white blood cell counts and absolute lymphocyte counts in mid (235 mg/kg bw/ day) and high dose female rats. However, all of the results that achieved statistical significance were well within historical control ranges, and the changes were small in magnitude and did not correlate with organ weight or microscopic observations. Thus, the hematological changes were interpreted to be of little toxicological significance and not adverse. There were no macroscopic or microscopic findings or organ weight changes attributed to Nephure\u2122 administration. Sporadic pathological findings were considered incidental as they showed no trends or patterns to suggest a relationship to administration of Nephure\u2122 and were observed at similar rates in Sprague-Dawley rats of similar age and gender (Germann et al., 1998 , Sugimoto et al., 2000 Percy and Barthold, 2007; McInnes, 2012) . One female rat administered 235 mg/kg bw/day Nephure\u2122 had a mammary gland adenocarcinoma in the thoracic region. This was also considered to be unrelated to the test material as it was isolated in nature and occurred at the middle dose. Mammary gland adenocarcinomas have been reported in Sprague-Dawley rats as young as twelve weeks of age (Kuzutani et al., 2012) . The age-dependent frequency of mammary adenocarcinoma findings makes it difficult to give robust quantitative statements. However, based upon experience at PSL adenocarcinomas are equally likely to be observed in control groups as they are treatment groups. Therefore, one or two adenocarcinomas in treatment groups are not considered to be test substance-related. The statistically significant increase in mid dose male spleen-to-body weight ratio and decrease in high dose female absolute brain weight did not correlate with any histopathological or clinical pathology findings, and there was no effect of the test material on any test of neurological function. It is recognized that organ weight changes in and of themselves, without macroscopic or microscopic correlation, are not necessarily treatment-related or adverse (Sellers et al., 2007) .",

The 90th percentile intake level is utilized in safety assessments to indicate high-level consumers of those products that may contain Nephure\u2122. On a gender basis, it is estimated that men will consume 14.77 mg Nephure\u2122/ day (0.246 mg/kg bw/day) and women will consume 10.35 mg/day (0.172 mg/kg bw/day) at the 90th percentile. People 20e29 years of age are estimated to consume a higher level of Nephure\u2122 at a mean of 6.54 mg/day (0.109 mg/kg bw/day) and 90th percentile of 14.58 mg/day (0.243 mg/kg bw/day assuming a 60 kg person). For substances that show no gender-or age-specific adverse effects (and there were none for Nephure\u2122), assessments evaluating potential long-term (chronic) intake rely on \"eater's only\" data at the 90th percentile, to avoid the possibility of underestimating intake by individuals that frequently consume foods that contain the ingredient. Based on a manganese content of 85.4 ppm, the amount of manganese that will be consumed at the 90th percentile level of intake of Nephure\u2122 for the eater's only individuals will be 1.06 mg (17.7 ng/kg bw/day), a nutritionally insignificant amount. Based on an optimal activity of 90 Units (mmol/min)/mg Nephure\u2122, the added mean and 90th percentile Nephure\u2122 consumption in terms of Units of enzymatic activity will be 518.4 Units/day (8.64 Units/kg bw/day) and 1114.2 Units/day (18.57 Units/kg bw/day). Thus, in 90th percentile consumers, addition of Nephure\u2122 to the foods stated in Table 9 could potentially degrade 1114.2 mmol oxalate (98 mg, based on a molecular weight of oxalate of 88.019 g/mol) in one minute.",

The results of the studies described in this manuscript show that Nephure\u2122 is not genotoxic and is not toxic to Sprague Dawley rats at the dose levels provided. Under the conditions of the study and based on the toxicological endpoints evaluated, the no-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for oral administration of Nephure\u2122 was 475 mg/kg/day (33,250 Units/kg bw/day), the highest dose evaluated for both male and female rats. When added to certain foods to decrease oxalate intake, Nephure\u2122 is estimated to be consumed at 12.38 mg/day at the 90th percentile of intake, which equates to approximately 1114.2 Units/day (18.57 Units/kg bw/day). Up to 3450 Units of activity/day (57.5 Units of activity/kg bw/day) can be safely consumed from addition of Nephure\u2122 to food to reduce the intake of dietary oxalate. S. elongates and the E. coli strain used in this work are not known to produce allergenic proteins, and potential cross-reactivity of the Nephure\u2122 protein sequence with known allergens is low, based on homology screening. The authors conclude that the weight of the toxicological data of the product supports the safety of the substance as a food ingredient.",
