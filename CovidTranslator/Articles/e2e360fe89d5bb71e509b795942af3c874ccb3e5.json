However, the mechanisms by which this occurs remain to be characterized. To explore these mechanisms, we combined three biochemical techniques -Stable Isotope Labeling of Amino acid in Cell cultures (SILAC); biotin labeling of plasma membrane proteins followed by affinity purification; and analysis of unique proteins binding to SNCA peptides on membrane arrays. The SILAC proteomic analysis identified 457 proteins, of which, 245 or 172 proteins belonged to membrane or membrane associated proteins, depending on the various bioinformatics tools used for interpretation. In dopamine neuronal cells treated with eSNCA, the levels of 86 membrane proteins were increased and 35 were decreased compared with untreated cells. In peptide array analysis, 127 proteins were identified as possibly interacting with eSNCA. Of those, seven proteins were overlapped with the membrane proteins that displayed alterations in relative abundance after eSNCA treatment. One was ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor alpha (CNTFR\u03b1), which appeared to modulate eSNCA-mediated neurotoxicity via mechanisms related to JAK1/ STAT3 signaling but independent of eSNCA endocytosis.",

It has also been shown to induce neurotoxicity either directly [4, 5] or indirectly by activating microglia [6] and astroglia [7] . Additionally, it appears that its aggregated forms are more potent than monomeric forms in activating glia or producing neural cell death [8] . The oligomers of SNCA has been shown to be cytotoxic by many investigators [9, 10] . The mutated SNCA, overexpressed SNCA, or oxidatively damaged SNCA to form soluble oligomers or eventually insoluble fibrils in Lewy bodies that are refractory to degradation, resulting in cell death [10, 11] . Finally, our previous experiments have demonstrated that aggregated eSNCA enter neurons much more effectively than monomers [5] .",

Most proposed hypotheses are based on descriptions related to endogenous SNCA, e.g. inhibiting mitochondrial function, increasing oxidative stress [12] , and interacting with other key intracellular proteins involved in cell death pathways. The key interacting proteins with endogenous SNCA include transcription factors like Elk-1 [13] , the NF-\u03ba signal transduction pathway [14] , and apoptotic proteins like Bcl-xl and Bax [15] . Very little is known about the interactions between eSNCA and neuronal proteins currently, and it is expected that the interaction of eSNCA with neuronal cell surface proteins could play important roles in its regulation of cell function or eSNCA-mediated neurotoxicity. Furthermore, to study the membrane proteins interacting with eSNCA is also of potential importance since they might become targets for future therapeutic intervention.",

For further identifying some plasma membrane proteins interacting with eSNCA, we have utilized some proteomic approaches. A definitive proteomic study of the plasma requires preparation of samples that are highly enriched in membrane proteins. This goal was achieved by affinity purification of proteins biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-LCbiotin, which involves a reaction of primary amines in the cell membrane proteins with Nhydroxysuccinimide (NHS) on the biotinylation reagent [28] . The biotinylation reagent is water-soluble and membrane impermeable. Therefore, only plasma membrane proteins of intact cells, at least in theory, should be labeled by sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin. To examine the quality of the biotin labeling procedure, labeled MES cells were visualized ( Fig 1A) with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated-avidin, demonstrating that the avidin-biotin interaction was highly enriched on the external surface of the membrane compartment. A significant enrichment of membranous proteins after affinity purification was also validated by examining various cellular markers in the whole-cell lysate, the crude membrane preparation after sequential cellular fractionation, and the final affinity-purified membrane fraction. The markers used were annexin II (plasma membrane), cytochrome C (mitochondria), and \u03b2actin (cytosol). The results, shown in Fig 1B, indicated that the affinity purified membranous fraction was very much enriched in annexin II with little, if any, cytochrome C and \u03b2-actin detected. Sample loading was compared using silver staining ( Fig 1C) . Simultaneously, The Streptavidin-HRP blot on plasma membrane fraction with or without biotin labeling was performed and shown that more proteins in plasma membrane fraction of biotinylated MES cells were enriched (Supplemental Fig 2) .",

            "text": "Having confirmed the quality of the proteins isolated from the plasma membrane by affinity purification, we further investigated the membranous proteins that might be involved in the interaction with eSNCA in MES cells. One quantitative proteomic technique, SILAC was performed. Briefly, MES cells were pre-labeled with either 12 C 6 L-arginine (light) or 13 C 6 L-arginine (heavy) SILAC reagents. The cells were treated with vehicle or pre-aged SNCA (eSNCA was used at 250 nM throughout the study), i.e. predominantly oligomers, not monomeric SNCA, respectively, for 1 hr before the samples were collected, when internalization of eSNCA was seen first by Western blotting (Fig 2A) , and before overt neurotoxicity occurs [29] . Monomeric SNCA was not used because of a possibility of aggregation of these monomers during culture, thereby confounding the results. It should be noted also that most eSNCA entered cells based on our previous experiments (23) . After the culture media was completely washed out, plasma membrane proteins were labeled with biotin, followed by affinity purification. They were then digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by \u03bcLC-MS/MS for protein identification and quantification. After the results from two independent runs were combined, a total of 457 proteins were identified (Supplemental Table 2 ; all identification with p>0.55 [translating to a false positive rate of <0.05], as determined by PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet methods, and with \u22652 unique peptides). Among the identified proteins, 86 were up regulated and 35 down regulated, respectively, in MES cells treated with and without eSNCA. The list of the proteins that were altered in relative abundance (a minimum increase or decrease by 50%) after eSNCA treatment, i.e. with potential regulatory effects of protein-protein interactions or cellular functions, is highlighted in Supplemental Table 2 . In addition, the identified proteins were cataloged for their biological processes as well as cellular components based on GO analysis, and the graphic presentation of protein groups can be found in Fig 2B. For the categories of biological processes, the proteins related to transport, signal, protein modification, metabolism, cell cycle, and cell migration are involved. Those belonging to one of the top-ranked GO biological process categories or most statistically overrepresented molecular functions of the identified proteins are shown in Table 1 . GO analysis on cellular components revealed that 245 (53.6%) were annotated as membrane or membrane-associated proteins among the 457 proteins identified. Of the remainder, with subcellular annotation, 2.5% were annotated as mitochondrion, 2.9% as ER/Golgi, 0.6% as lysosome/proteasome, 9.3% as cytoplasmic and 16.0% as nuclear. As the transmembrane domain sequences are indicative of membrane proteins, the identified proteins were also analyzed by the software TMHMM and SignalP for these motifs in order to provide an additional criterion for the evaluation. TMHMM software is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based transmembrane protein prediction algorithm that predicts protein topology and the number of transmembrane helices. Information from TMHMM and SignalP was combined to separate proteins into the following categories: a) cell surface proteins that contained predicted non-cleavable signal peptides and no predicted transmembrane segments; b) secreted proteins that contained predicted cleavable signal peptides and no predicted transmembrane segments; c) transmembrane proteins that contained predicted transmembrane segments and extracellular loops and/or intracellular loops; d) intracellular proteins that contained neither predicted signal peptides nor predicted transmembrane regions. The two softwares predicted 172 (37.6%) proteins to be transmembrane and/or extracellular proteins, of which, 128 had at least one predicted transmembrane domain and 46 were extracellular proteins. The results are also indicated in Supplemental Table 2 .",

Although proteins without quantitative changes could still be important in interacting with SNCA, proteins with quantitative changes of their plasma membrane levels when cells were treated with eSCNA might be more biological relevant, reflecting dynamic changes on plasma membrane when cells adapt to the external signal, e.g., receptor internalization or upregulation; as the first step towards validating novel proteins, we selected proteins displaying quantitative changes for validation with an independent means (Supplemental Fig  1) . Due to the impracticability of verifying all candidate proteins, the following criteria were used in selecting candidate proteins for confirmation: a) the identification of proteins was based on multiple peptides; b) there was an overlap between the biotin plasma membrane enrichment and SNCA-associated proteins identification; c) there was an antibody commercially available; d) it belonged to a top-ranked biological process category as determined by GO analysis as well as being a membrane protein as determined by GO analysis and TMHMM software; and e) it demonstrated changes in relative abundance after eSNCA treatment. With these criteria in mind, CNTFR-\u03b1 was selected as the prime candidate for confirming an association with eSNCA. Of note, though our focus in on the proteins with alterations in treated cells, proteins displaying quantitative changes in control cells could also be important. As shown in Fig 4A, spatial co-localization of eSNCA with CNTFR-\u03b1 was apparent in the peri-membrane region. To further confirm the association of CNTFR-\u03b1 with SNCA, co-immunoprecipitation was performed with CNTFR-\u03b1 or SNCA antibody, followed by immunoblotting with anti-SNCA and anti-CNTFR-\u03b1 respectively. The results, shown in Fig 4B, demonstrated that SNCA and CNTFR-\u03b1 were indeed present whether CNTFR-\u03b1 or SNCA antibody was used as the bait initially.",

As the first step to define the biological roles of CNTFR-\u03b1 in aggregated SNCA-mediated neurotoxicity, we asked whether knocking down CNTFR-\u03b1 could have any effect on the neurite out-growth, an early sign of neurotoxicity, which is also a more sensitive assay comparing to those determined by viability assays, e.g. MTT, in MES cells. The results (Fig 5A) indicated that siRNA of CNTFR-\u03b1 significantly inhibited the expression of the CNTFR-\u03b1 protein. In this part of the investigation, MES cells were pre-treated with a low level of rotenone (5 nM) briefly (6 hrs) to stress the system, followed by treatment with 250nM pre-aged eSNCA for 1 hr. The results, shown in Fig 5B, revealed that rotenone or eSNCA alone did not cause significant loss of neurites in this treatment regimen. However, the average length of the neurites was decreased significantly when cells were treated with eSNCA in addition to rotenone, an effect significantly reversed by knocking down the CNTFR-\u03b1 levels. It should be emphasized that eSNCA at 250 nM, alone, does cause appreciable neurotoxicity when assessed one day after exposure [5] .

The results demonstrated that manipulation of CNTFR-\u03b1 levels had no effect on the internalization of aggregated eSNCA (Fig 6A) . On the other hand, JAK1, a critical protein known to be modulated by CNTFR-\u03b1, demonstrated a significant induction in MES cells exposed to eSNCA, which was substantially attenuated by CNTFR-\u03b1 siRNA (Fig 6B) . It should be stressed that the changes in the signal pathway appeared to be more sensitive than neurite out-growth as an index, because the effect could be appreciated without rotenone pre-treatment. Additionally, of note was the observation that CNTFR-\u03b1 siRNA seemed to block the translocation of STAT3, a down-stream effector of JAK1, from the cytosol to the nucleus (Fig 6C) .",

In the current investigation, a total of 245 or 172 (i.e. 53.6% or 37.6% of total proteins, depending on the bioinformatics tools used) were identified as membrane proteins (Supplemental Table 2 ). One might ask why there are so many non-specific proteins in the list despite the utilization of SILAC labeling, cellular fractionation and avidin-biotin affinity purification. The reasons might include: 1) since MS is an extremely sensitive technique, even minute contamination from other cellular compartments could produce false positive results (in reality, it is almost impossible to absolutely avoid cross-compartment contamination. However, this possibility has been diminished greatly by SILAC labeling, where minimal cellular manipulation is involved and the focus is placed on proteins with quantitative changes induced by aggregated -synuclein); 2) proteins traditionally considered as non-membranous could be identified in the membrane. A good example is SNCA itself, because SNCA was initially thought only to exist in the synapse but has now been demonstrated to be able to associate with membranes and present in multiple cellular compartments, including the extracellular space; and 3) intracellular proteins leaking out of unhealthy cells were labeled with the biotinylating reagent.",

Remarkably, almost all of these proteins are associated with protein transportation, endocytosis, etc. Our previous study has indicated that clathrin interacted with SNCA and played an important role in the endocytosis of eSNCA in microglia [21] . Nonetheless, a detailed discussion on each of these proteins is not really meaningful until confirmational studies are performed, demonstrating that they are indeed involved in the process of eSNCA mediated neurotoxicity.",

We, as well as others, have demonstrated that oligomeric eSNCA can decrease the viability of neuronal cells over 1-3 days after treatment [5] , and endocytosis of eSNCA appears to be at least partially involved. The goal of this study was to identify plasma membrane proteins that directly interact with eSNCA thereby mediating neurotoxicity, whether via endocytosis or not. The list of proteins was shown in Table 2 , which are potentially interacting with SNCA. For further validation of interesting proteins, the criteria used in selecting candidate proteins included: 1) the identification and quantification of each candidate are based on multiple peptides; 2) there is an antibody available commercially; and 3) either the candidate has to be an important protein in signal transduction or endocytosis process, but its relationship to SNCA has not been studied yet. With these caveats in mind, we selected CNTFR-\u03b1, a protein normally localized to the neuronal plasma membrane and anchored by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage that is sensitive to proteolysis and phospholipase-c-mediated cleavage following injury [30] . Although CNTFR-\u03b1 was initially identified as a specific receptor of ciliary neurotrophic factor [31] , it could interact with other proteins, as seen in more recent investigations [32] . In addition, CNTFR-\u03b1 could be released into the extracellular space as a soluble component [33] , and has been identified in proximity to injured tissues [34, 35] .",

One obvious possibility is that it serves as an adapter, linking eSNCA to endocytotic machinery, including clathrin [21] , for entering neurons or glia. However, the fact that knocking down CNTFR-\u03b1 expression did not affect the amount of internalized eSNCA seems to suggest that CNTFR-\u03b1 is not vital to eSNCA endocytosis into the neuronal cells or endocytosis related neurotoxicity. To this end, it needs to be pointed out that our previous data suggest that the internalization of eSNCA is not necessarily required for eSNCA-mediated microglial activation [36] . As to how CNTFR-\u03b1 might mediate eSNCA neurotoxicity, we explored two major independent pathways known to be important in CNTFR-\u03b1-mediating cell signaling: JAK1/STAT3 and Ras/MAPK, which is also mainly transmitted via the JAK1/STAT3 pathway [31] . JAK1/STAT3 signaling (with nuclear translocation) is uniquely susceptible to pro-oxidant compounds such as H 2 O 2 , nitric oxide, and rotenone, all of which are important to understanding PD pathogenesis [37] . It has also been implicated in the cellular effects provoked by A\u03b2 (a key protein involved in Alzheimer's disease) [38] . In addition, while STAT3 was activated, the neurons were in the course of cell death [39] .",

More importantly, manipulation of CNTFR-\u03b1 not only partially restored changes in JAK1/STAT3 increase/activation induced by eSNCA but also significantly protected MES cells from eSNCA-related neurotoxicity. It should be stressed that the protection (after knocking down CNTFR-\u03b1) to eSNCA-mediated neurotoxicity was incomplete, which should not be surprising, for the reason that eSNCA can produce neurotoxicity via multiple pathways. For instance, in our recent investigation, it is clear that the recycling of internalized eSNCA also plays an important role in eSNCA-mediated neuronal dysfunctions [29] . Additionally, SNCA has been reported to interact with other proteins, including a transcription factor Elk-1 [40] , mortalin [41] and DJ-1 (directly or indirectly) [42] , all of which appear to be critical to PD pathogenesis (but under these circumstances, SNCA endocytosis-based mechanisms might become more important). Finally, because the JAK1/ STAT3 signaling pathway is negatively regulated by receptor internalization to endocytic vesicles with subsequent receptor degradation [43] , the effect of eSNCA through CNTFR-\u03b1 on neuronal cell might be transient or minimized.",
