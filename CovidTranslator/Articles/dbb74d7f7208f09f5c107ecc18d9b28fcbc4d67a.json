The estimated shelf life (t 90 ) for hydrolysis of the prodrug at 4\u00b0C and pH 7.4 was found to be two years. In a mouse model of human colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29), the prodrug administered intraperitoneally was effective in reducing or eliminating xenograft tumors at dose levels as low as 0.3 mg/kg when given daily and at 0.9 mg/kg when given less frequently. When given via intraperitoneal and oral routes at daily doses of 0.6 and 0.9 mg/kg, the prodrug was also effective and well tolerated in a mouse model of human ovarian cancer (A2780).",

            "text": "Triptolide (1, Figure 1 ), a diterpene triepoxide, was first isolated from the medicinal plant Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TWHF) and structurally characterized in 1972. 1 In the following 43 years, it has been reported to be active in vitro by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of various cancer cell lines and as preventing tumor growth and metastases in vivo. 2 More recently, triptolide has been found to be effective against various cancers such as pancreatic cancer, 3 neuroblastoma, 4 breast cancer, 5 and prostate cancer. 6 The mechanisms of action of triptolide have been extensively investigated, 7, 8 and evidence has been provided that triptolide can covalently modify proteins presumably by epoxide ring opening reactions. 1,2,9\u221211 It was recently shown that triptolide inhibits the ATPase activity of human XPB (xeroderma pigmentosum B) by covalently binding Cys342 of XPB to the 12,13-epoxide. 9, 10 Because XPB is part of transcription factor THFIIH, RNA II polymerase-mediated transcription and DNA excision repair are inhibited. 9 Many of the observed anticancer effects can be explained by this mechanism, but other mechanisms 12 have been observed such as epigenetic modifications, suppressing kinases, and Hsp70 expression. 3, 13, 14 Triptolide was also reported to be the first DCTPP1 (dCTP pyrophosphatase) inhibitor. 15 It is of interest to note that this is a noncovalent interaction of triptolide with the target protein. Furthermore, the compound has multiple biological activities that could have value in other therapeutic areas. 2, 16 Triptolide was reported to stimulate polycystin-2 channel opening, thereby restoring calcium signaling and resulting in attenuation of cyst formation in a mouse model of polycystic kidney disease. 17 It is also known for its reversible male antifertility effects. 18 In addition, triptolide was shown to preserve cognitive function in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. 19, 20 The anticancer and other activities of triptolide such as its immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties are more thoroughly described in recent reviews. 6, 7, 12 Recent studies focus on the development of triptolide and its derivatives as potential antileukemic 21 and antineoplastic agents. 22, 23 Despite its promising bioactivities, poor aqueous solubility, dose-dependent toxicity, narrow therapeutic window, and lack of patent protection of triptolide are impediments to its preclinical development and clinical success. Two early stage clinical trials of triptolide as a potential drug for rheumatoid arthritis were conducted in the US over a decade ago. 24, 25 The 5-hydroxytriptolide derivative 5-hydroxytriptolide (LLDT-8, 2, Figure 1 ) is currently in phase I clinical trial in China for rheumatoid arthritis. 16 Prodrug strategies, involving carboxylic and amino acid esters, have been utilized previously with the intent to achieve desirable water solubility of triptolide. 26, 27 While several prodrugs of triptolide have been reported in the literature, triptolide succinate (omtriptolide, F6008, PG490-88, 3, Figure  1 ) is the only one reported to have entered clinical trials. 28 Unfortunately, the cleavage of the prodrug moiety was slow and incomplete, and significant interpatient variability was reported. 29 This does not discount the prodrug strategy but suggests that other prodrugs that provide a reliable release of triptolide are needed. A nontoxic, water-soluble, chemically stable, and patentable prodrug approach would be a viable option to overcome some of the physicochemical limitations of triptolide for the clinical development of this natural product.",

However, in larger scale preparations where contact between the compound and silica gel is required for a longer period of time, 60\u2212100% degradation was observed depending on the amount of substrate and the level of deactivation of the silica gel. Attempts to use alternate sorbents such as Florisil or alumina, as well as triethylamine deactivation of silica gel, resulted in similar levels of degradation. It was not possible to avoid purification prior to hydrogenation due to the various sulfur derivatives formed during the course of the synthesis. These compounds, even in minute quantities, can poison the Pd/C catalyst used in the benzyl ether cleavage. This led to increased catalytic loading and longer reaction time, which in turn resulted in a larger number and quantity of impurities that contaminated the final product. Additionally, during the formation of dibenzyl phosphate 8, 7\u221210% of succinimide was produced from the reagent NIS, which coeluted during column chromatography. An alternative purification methodology was developed utilizing a sequence of extractions that are described in Experimental Section, which removed most of the impurities while avoiding product decomposition.

However, pH adjustment is not a viable approach to increase the solubility of molecules such as triptolide that lack ionizable groups. For such compounds, various strategies including the use of cosolvents, surfactants, and complexing agents (for example, parenterally safe cyclodextrins) have been used to overcome aqueous solubility limitations. However, some of these techniques can contribute significantly to toxicity. Ideally phosphonooxymethyl prodrugs will have good water solubility, particularly at physiological pH. Avoiding pH extremes and/or cosolvent addition could allow for rapid parenteral infusion without the risk of drug precipitation. Using HPLC, the aqueous solubility (buffered to pH 7.4 with Tris at room temperature) of triptolide was determined to be 17 \u03bcg/mL while that of 4 was 61 mg/mL. Thus, by prodrug formation, the solubility was enhanced 3600 times. We also estimated the second dissociation constant (pK a2 ) of 4. In solution, depending on the pH, the prodrug would exist in its diacidic, monobasic, or dibasic states as represented in Scheme 3. The pK a1 has limited pharmaceutical relevance, because the pH of most physiologically acceptable solutions would ensure ionization of the diacidic species. However, the pK a2 is significant given its influence on aqueous solubility, chemical stability, and effectiveness as an enzyme substrate to ensure bioconversion. Therefore, within the pharmaceutically relevant pH range, 4 would exist in an equilibrium between its monobasic and dibasic species. Thus, titration of an equilibrium mixture of these two species provides an acid ionization constant, pK a2 , whose value corresponds to the inflection point. Estimation of this pK a2 using 31 P NMR is advantageous, as the 31 P isotope has high natural abundance (100%) and its chemical shift is indicative of the change in ionization state of the phosphorus moiety. 54 The 31 P NMR spectrum of 4 was obtained as a function of pH. The experimental data shown for the change in observed phosphorus chemical shifts of 4 in solutions at varying pH ( Figure 2 ) was used to determine pK a2 (eq 4, experimental part). The pH dependency of this observed chemical shift measurement resulted in a sigmoidal curve, which is typical of an acid\u2212base titration. The pK a2 value of 4 was found to be 6.61, which compares favorably to estimates from the literature. 55\u221257 At pH 7.4, 4 would exist predominantly as a dianion, thus ensuring high solubility.",

These enzymes have the natural function of digesting macromolecules for use as nutrients, but they can also bind and hydrolyze drug compounds. Therefore, prodrugs must be stable in the acidic, basic, and enzymatic conditions of the GI tract for in vivo oral dosing. The excipients in a formulation may also promote prodrug decomposition. Therefore, in vitro physiological stability of prodrugs in various buffers (pH 1\u22129) and in simulated gastrointestinal fluids should be assessed to gain insight into the stability of prodrugs. Thus, 4 was incubated with simulated gastric fluid (SGF), simulated intestinal fluid (SIF), and various buffers (pH 1\u22129). Oral dosing exposes compounds to pH 1\u22122 in the stomach, pH 4.5 at the beginning of the small intestine, pH 6.6 on average for the small intestine, and pH 5\u22127 in the colon. The gastric emptying time varies from 0.5\u22121 h in the fasted state to several hours after a heavy meal. SGF simulates stomach fluid and incorporates acidic and enzymatic hydrolysis conditions. SIF mimics the pH and hydrolytic enzymes in the intestine. Incubation of 4 in these solutions is a rapid way to determine if 4 would be stable under conditions found in the GI tract. Compound 4 demonstrated pH-dependent stability and rapidly degraded with conversion to triptolide in simulated gastric fluid and at very low pH values (1\u22122) and in simulated gastric fluid whereas it was markedly stable at higher pH values (3\u22129) and in simulated intestinal fluid ( Table 1 ). The shorter half-life at low pH for 4 could result in acid-mediated removal of the promoiety in the stomach. However, 4 can be \"protected\" from the stomach acid by enteric coating.",

To be practically useful, prodrugs must possess adequate chemical stability under the conditions of their use. Prodrugs intended for intravenous administration should exhibit adequate solution state stability so that a readyto-use preparation with a reasonably long shelf life (i.e., 2 or more years) can be formulated. If the solution state stability is inadequate, the drug can be formulated as a dry powder (usually by lyophilization) and reconstituted into solution right before administration. For example, Safadi and co-workers described the development of phosphonooxymethyl carbonates as novel, water-soluble prodrugs of hindered alcohols. However, the lack of adequate chemical stability limited the commercial and clinical potential of this prodrug concept. 38 The chemical hydrolysis of 4 was followed at pH of 7.4 because the neutral pH range is perfectly suited for formulation delivery from a physiological perspective. We found that the hydrolysis of 4 followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. Using the pseudofirst-order rate constants, determined at several temperatures between 40 and 70\u00b0C (Table 2) , the Arrhenius plot was drawn (not shown). From this plot, the activation energy (E a ) was calculated to be 63.4 kJ/mol. By extrapolating the plot to lower temperatures, the k obsd at 25 and at 4\u00b0C were obtained. This enabled the calculation of the half-life (t 1/2 ) and shelf life (t 90 ) of 4 at 25 and 4\u00b0C (Table 3) .",

For the in vitro evaluation of the dephosphorylation of 4, alkaline phosphatase from bovine intestinal mucosa was chosen. As implied by its name, this enzyme has maximum activity in the alkaline region (pH 9.8). The in vitro assay for phosphate monoester prodrugs is typically performed at pH 9.8, an optimum pH for the activity of alkaline phosphatases. The evaluation of bioconversion kinetics is, however, more relevant if performed at physiological pH. Thus, a change in pH of reaction media to 7.4 may, in principle, reduce the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. However, for proof-of-concept, confirming that 4 was indeed the substrate of alkaline phosphatase was paramount. Clearly, if 4 is administered parenterally in humans, the overwhelming presence of alkaline phosphate in vivo should guarantee bioconversion. The in vitro enzymatic lability of 4 was recently reported by us. 44 We carried out the bioconversion of 4 into triptolide in the presence of alkaline phosphatase in glycine buffer at pH 9.8 (Scheme 4). Exposure of 4 to phosphatases cleaves the phosphate group and releases the hydroxymethyl derivative 9, which is chemically unstable and spontaneously releases triptolide and formaldehyde. The release of formaldehyde from prodrugs could raise a possible concern because of perceived toxicity. 60 However, it is well-known that the turnover of formaldehyde in the human body from endogenous formaldehyde production by normal metabolism and from exogenous exposure (for example from food) is in the range of 31\u221259 g per day. 60 Because prodrugs only release milligram amounts of formaldehyde from phosphonooxymethyl prodrugs per day, the small amount of formaldehyde adds very little to the baseline exposure of gram quantities produced by normal metabolism. In addition, given the short half-life of 1.5 min for formaldehyde, which is converted to formic acid, exposure to formaldehyde produced by a prodrug would be limited to approximately 10 min. 60 Both the disappearance of 4 and the formation of triptolide were measured. Compound 4 degradation was a first-order process. The half-life (t 1/2 ) of 4 was determined to be 2 min in the presence of alkaline phosphatase, showing rapid conversion of the modified drug into its parent compound. Additionally, 4 was found to be stable for 1 h in a similar assay conducted in the absence of alkaline phosphatase. The short half-life of 4 in this assay indicates that the enzymatically catalyzed breakdown of 4 occurred at a fast rate. A short half-life for 4 is consistent with our hypothesis that a methylene-linked phosphate prodrug would be released rapidly and not be hampered by steric hindrance as seen with the succinate prodrug omtriptolide. Steric hindrance has been noted in the bioconversion of a number of phosphate and phosphonooxymethyl prodrugs. 37, 61 Evaluation of 4 for Efficacy in Mouse Models of Cancer. It was previously reported that compound 4 can reduce tumor growth, prevent tumor progression, and improve survival in multiple mouse models of pancreatic cancer. 44, 45 The efficacy of 4 has also been demonstrated in preclinical models of osteosarcoma, nonsmall cell lung carcinoma, human papillomavirus-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and ovarian cancer. 46\u221249 These studies evaluated the efficacy of 4 after daily intraperitoneal (IP) administration.",

Then benzoyl peroxide (53.7 g, 221 mmol, 4 equiv) was added portionwise during the course of 2 h. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was stirred at 0\u00b0C for 2 h, diluted with ethyl acetate (1200 mL), washed with diluted sodium carbonate (saturated Na 2 CO 3 : H 2 O, 1:2) (2 \u00d7 150 mL) and brine (150 mL), and dried over sodium sulfate overnight. The solvent was then removed under reduced pressure, and the resulting viscous mass containing crystals was filtered through a glass filter and washed with cold ethyl acetate (50 mL). The collected solid was air-dried to yield triptonide (7; 7.01 g). The filtrate's volume was removed under reduced pressure, and the residue was dried overnight under high vacuum to produce 47.4 g of crude product. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using EtOAc\u2212hexanes (1:2) and then EtOAc\u2212CH 2 Cl 2 (1:1 followed by 2:1) mixtures as eluents to produce the target compound 5 (11.97 g; 51.4%) and additional amounts of triptonide (7; 2.10 g; the total yield of triptonide was 9.11 g, 46%).",

To a solution of compound 5 (6.0 g; 14.3 mmol) in dry dichloromethane (240 mL) were added powdered 4 \u00c5 molecular sieves (6.0 g). The reaction mixture was placed under dry nitrogen, and then a solution of dibenzyl phosphate (4.78 g (17.2 mmol) and N-iodosuccinimide (3.86 g; 17.2 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (240 mL) was added slowly at 15\u221220\u00b0C. After the addition was completed, the reaction mixture was stirred at rt for a period of 3 h, filtered, and diluted with dichloromethane (2400 mL). The solution was shaken with 0.1 M thiosulfate (240 mL) until fully decolorized and then washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate (240 mL) and brine (240 mL). The organic solution was dried over sodium sulfate for 0.5 h and filtered, and then the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile (900 mL), and the solution was extracted with pentane (4 \u00d7 200 mL). The acetonitrile solution was evaporated on a rotary evaporator followed by high vacuum overnight drying.

To a 1 L round-bottom flask equipped with septa and stir bar were added Pd/C (1.8 g) and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (10 mL). The flask was cooled in an ice bath and saturated with hydrogen gas using a bubbler under stirring up to full replacement of air. The bubbler was removed, and a solution of dibenzyl ester 8 (8.42 g; 12.94 mmol) in dry THF (700 mL) was added into the flask through a cannula while stirring and cooling the flask with an ice bath. Then the reaction mixture was saturated with hydrogen again and left under stirring in the hydrogen atmosphere for 3 h. The reaction mixture was monitored by TLC (EtOAc\u2212hexanes, 3:2) until disappearance of dibenzyl ester 8. After completion, the reaction mixture was purged with nitrogen and filtered through a pad of Celite. The THF solution was cooled to 10\u221212\u00b0C and an ice cold solution of anhydrous sodium carbonate (1.235 g; 11.65 mmol) in deionized water (240 mL) was added slowly with stirring to keep the temperature below 18\u00b0C. Then the solvents were removed on a rotary evaporator followed by high vacuum evaporation to give a slightly cloudy aqueous solution. The solution was placed into equipment for continuous extraction with dichloromethane and underwent extraction for 72 h. Then the aqueous solution was separated from CH 2 Cl 2 and extracted with ethyl acetate (4 \u00d7 30 mL). Traces of organic solvent were removed by rotary evaporation, and the aqueous solution was passed through a 0.2 \u03bcm Acrodisc syringe filter to give a clear aqueous solution.

Purification by preparative HPLC eluted with 15% methanol in water provides 99% pure 4 as a colorless hygroscopic powder. 1 Aqueous Solubility Determination. Approximately 5 mg of each compound was weighed into 2 mL glass vials (in triplicate); 0.2 mL of Tris buffer (pH 7.4) was added for samples of 4 and 2 mL for triptolide samples. Each buffered solution was saturated with 4 or triptolide. The vials were then capped, sonicated, and vortexed prior to submersion in a constant temperature shaking bath (100 shakes/min maintained at 25\u00b0C) for 24 h after which time excess solid drug was removed from the saturated solution by centrifugation and filtration.
