Among them, the pollution area is inside, the non-pollution area is surrounding, and the half-contaminated area is in the middle. Fig.2 provides the common layout structure of the containment laboratory -Biosafety Level 3 in China. Research shows that 86.6% of operation can cause microbe aerosol, and the unexplained laboratory infection which may cause by the diffusion of microbe aerosol in the air according to 276 kinds of operational testing in laboratories [10] . The common way of biological emissions handling is the negative pressure technology in biosafety laboratories, the ventilation system makes each region maintain a certain negative pressure to ensure the unidirectional flow, and then may be discharged through HEPA filters, the flow process is given in fig 3. The main risks in the above process include the various operation accidents in biological safety cabinets and the efficiency decreases of HEPA filters (installation corrosion, failure, breakage). The wastewater from high-level biosafety laboratories can be divided into general wastewater and biological wastewater. The general wastewater that contains no pathogenic microorganism can be directly discharge into the external environment. The united mode on chemical disinfection and physical disinfection is mostly adopted for treating biological wastewater to ensure the laboratory wastewater contains no live pathogenic microorganism [11] [12] [13] [14] . The biological wastewater which achieves comprehensive emissions standards can be used for greening or discharge (See Fig. 4) .",
