            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), an emerging disease characterized by atypical pneumonia, has recently been attributed to a novel coronavirus. The genome of SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has recently been sequenced, and a number of genes identified, including that of the nucleocapsid protein (N). It is noted, however, that the N protein of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV N) shares little homology with nucleocapsid proteins of other members of the coronavirus family [Science 300 (2003) 1399; Science 300 (2003) 1394]. N proteins of other coronavirus have been reported to be involved in forming the viral core and also in the packaging and transcription of the viral RNA. As data generated from some viral systems other than coronaviruses suggested that viral N-N self-interactions may be necessary for subsequent formation of the nucleocapsid and assembly of the viral particles, we decided to investigate SARS-CoV N-N interaction. By using mammalian two-hybrid system and sucrose gradient fractionations, a homotypic interaction of N, but not M, was detected by the two-hybrid analysis. The mammalian two-hybrid assay revealed an approximately 50-fold increase in SEAP activity (measurement of protein-protein interaction) in N-N interaction compared to that observed in either M-M or mock transfection. Furthermore, mutational analyses characterized that a serine/arginine-rich motif (SSRSSSRSRGNSR) between amino acids 184 and 196 is crucial for N protein oligomerization, since deletion of this region completely abolished the N protein self-multimerization. Finally, the full-length nucleocapsid protein expressed and purified from baculovirus system was found to form different levels of higher order structures as detected by Western blot analysis of the fractionated proteins. Collectively, these results may aid us in elucidating the mechanism pertaining to formation of viral nucleocapsid core, and designing molecular approaches to intervene SARS-CoV replication.",

            "text": "The family Coronaviridae is composed of a number of enveloped viruses whose single-stranded positive sense RNA genomes are among the largest of the RNA viruses, ranging from 25 to 30 kb [3, 4] . Coronaviruses typically infect avian or mammalian hosts and are in fact responsible for roughly 30% of mild upper respiratory tract illnesses in humans [4] . Recently, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia in Asia, Canada, and elsewhere, dubbed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), was attributed to a novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [5, 6] . In contrast to other members of its family, SARS-CoV results in severe morbidity and mortality in up to 10% of infected patients [7] . The genome of SARS-CoV was found to be roughly 29,700 nucleotides long, with a characteristic coronavirus genome organization of 5 0 -replicase, spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid-3 0 [1, 2] . The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV is 422 amino acids long, sharing only 20-30% homology with the N proteins of other coronaviruses [1, 2] . Previous studies indicate that the N proteins of other coronaviruses are extensively phosphorylated, highly basic, and associated with viral RNA to form a helical ribonucleoprotein (RNP), which comprises the viral core structure [8] . A variety of functional activities have been ascribed to the N proteins of previously known coronaviruses, including participation in transcription of the viral genome, the formation of viral core, and packaging viral RNA [3, 9] . However, no similar functional roles of SARS-CoV have been reported so far in the literature except that SARS-CoV N may selectively activate AP-1 pathway [10] . Furthermore, while it is of note that self-interaction of nucleocapsid proteins (N-N interaction) and N protein interactions with other viral proteins have been reported to be one of the crucial steps in the formation and assembly of viral particles [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Such proteinprotein interactions, especially N-N self-interaction in coronaviruses, are poorly documented. To better understand SARS-CoV replication, multimerization of the N protein was investigated by both in vitro and in vivo approaches in our current studies. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was first used to identify N protein homotypic interaction, followed by analysis of sequentially truncated proteins to locate the amino acid segments responsible for N-N self-interaction in the mammalian two-hybrid system. We found self-interaction of N, not the viral membrane protein (M), in the aforementioned assays, since a 50-fold increase in the level of SEAP activity (indicator of protein-protein interaction) was observed in N-N interaction compared to M-M interaction and mock transfection. In addition, a serine/arginine-rich region composed of 13 amino acids was found to be crucial for self-interaction of the nucleocapsid protein because deletion of these amino acids completely abolished N multimerization. Finally, multimerization of N was also observed in vitro by using sucrose gradient centrifugation in conjunction with Western blotting detection, which revealed formation of higher order structures of the N proteins. The significance of these findings will be discussed.",

Primers for the amplification are 5 0 GTAC GAATTCATGTCTGATAATGGACCCCAATC 3 0 and 5 0 GTAC GGATCC-GTGGTCATCATGAGTGTTTATG 3 0 . The amplified product was then purified with MiniElute PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), followed by digestion with EcoRI and BamHI (underlined sequence in primers). The digested DNA fragments were subsequently ligated in-frame into pGBK/T7, pGAD/T7, pM, and pVP16 vectors. As additional controls under the same assay conditions for N, the gene for SARS-CoV membrane (M) was amplified with the following primers: 5 0 GTACGAATTCATG-GCAGACAACGGTA 3 0 and GTA CGGATCC-TTACTGTACTAGCAAAGCA.

The expression vector for SARS-CoV M gene is designated as pGBK-M and pGAD-M in this report. To identify putative domains of amino acid sequences required for multimerization, sequential deletion starts from 5 0 in the nucleocapsid gene, all sense primers used in the study carry EcoRI restriction site (Table 1) , and the antisense primer sequence is the same one used for full-length nucleocapsid gene cloning as mentioned above. Primers for these fragments are listed in Table 1 . The sequential deletions resulted in an approximately 40 nt truncation (see below for details). In addition to sequential deletion mutants, a serine/arginine-rich motif (amino acid 184-196) was deleted using following primers: 5 0 [Phosp]AG AGGCTTGACTGCCG-CCTCTGCTTCC 3 0 and 5 0 [Phosp]AATTC A-ACTCCTGGCAGCAGTAG 3 0 .

The fractionated proteins were then subjected to Western blotting with anti-His-tag primary antibody.

Also, no N protein was detected in cells transfected with pBlueBacHis2 alone. The fact that the major amount of the expressed N protein was sequestered in the 30%, 40%, and 50% fractions rather than the 10% and 20% suggests that the majority of the expressed N protein was in the form of higher molecular structures.",

Vero cells were co-transfected with full-length SARS-CoV N protein constructs, pM-N + pVP-N along with pG5SEAP reporter vector, and incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C in a CO 2 incubator. Co-transfection samples, the cloning vector pM + pVP16, and SARS-CoV M protein constructs pM-M + pVP-M, were designated as negative controls. Error bars represent standard deviation (usually less than 10%). mutants were generated. The distribution of truncation is shown in Fig. 4A . These mutants' fragments were cloned into mammalian two-hybrid vector pM. The eight sequential truncation mutants of the SARS-CoV N protein, designated from DpM-N1 to DpM-N8, were co-transfected with pG5SEAP reporter vector and pVP-N, which contains full-length N gene. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, a chemiluminescence-based assay was conducted to measure the protein-protein interaction activity through the SEAP reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 4B, DpM-N1 (aa 43-423) , DpM-N2 (aa 84-423), DpM-N3 (aa 126-423), and DpM-N4 (aa 168-423) showed similar levels of chemiluminescence activities compared with full-length N protein. Importantly, it is noted that deletion of 168-208 resulted in a loss of N-N self-interaction, since virtually no chemiluminescence activity was observed in mutants DpM-N5, DpM-N6, DpM-N7, and DpM-N8. Because a region composed of 41 amino acids from aa 168 to 208 has been found to be crucial for N multimerization in the above mapping study, we were interested in employing a further investigation on a specific epitope in this region, which is pivotal for the N self-multimerization. It came to our attention from protein sequence analyses that there is a serine/arginine-rich region, which appears to be relatively conserved among most coronaviruses following Table 1 . (B) Mammalian two-hybrid analysis of truncation mutant constructs of N protein in comparison with full-length N protein. pM-N mutants were cotransfected with pVP16-N and the reporter vector pG5SEAP into Vero cells. Chemiluminescent activity of secreted alkaline phosphatase present in cell culture medium was assayed as described in Materials and methods. Data represent an increase in chemiluminescence as compared to cotransfected vector controls. Error bars represent standard deviation (usually less than 10%). (C) Mammalian two-hybrid analysis of the requirement of the serine/arginine-rich region for the N protein self-interaction. The co-transfected samples were full-length N protein constructs pM-N and pVP-N, serine/arginine-rich region deletion mutant DpM-N/SR and pVP-N, and SARS-CoV M protein pM-M and pVP-M. The reporter vector pG5SEAP was also co-transfected in each group. Chemiluminescent activity of secreted alkaline phosphatase in cell culture medium was analyzed as described in Materials and methods. Error bars represent standard deviation (usually less than 10%). GenBank searches. We consequently decided to delete this motif and use the mutant DpM-N/SR. As shown in Fig. 4C , deletion of the serine/arginine-rich region (aa 184-196) resulted in a complete loss of SEAP activities, suggesting these amino acids are required for N selfinteraction. Finally, consistent with results in Fig. 2 , no self-interaction was observed in the viral M proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that amino acids 184-196 are indispensable for multimerization of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein.",

Sub-cellular localization of the viral protein is one of the commonly used approaches to characterize the involvement of the protein in the virus assembly [22] [23] [24] [25] . The N protein and its SR-deletion mutant were cloned into a red-color fluorescent vector pAs-Red2; the two vectors were, respectively, co-transformed with a nuclear localization vector pECFP-nuc. As indicated in Fig. 5A , the wild-type N protein was localized around the nucleus, forming an eclipse-like protein localization, while the SR-deletion mutant (Fig.  5B ) demonstrated a completely different distribution pattern with scattered localization surrounding the nucleus. This result implicated that the SR region in the SARS-CoV N protein was not only responsible for the multimerization of the protein, but also pertinent to the sub-cellular localization of the protein, which is important for the virus assembly.",

The multimerization of nucleocapsid proteins of coronaviruses is possibly a functional form of the protein, which may be involved in the virion assembly by stabilizing the helical structure of the N protein [26] . A study on another coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), revealed that a multimerized form of the nucleocapsid protein was observed from Western blot analysis [26] . Although N-N in MHV has been identified in two independent groups, functional domains for MHV N-N interactions remain to be defined [9] . Two lines of evidence prompted us to conduct the current studies on SARS-CoV N protein: (1) the scarcity of published data on the N-N interaction in other coronaviruses hinders the elucidation of the mechanism involving formation of coronavirus nucleocapsid core; (2) little homology between SARS-CoV N and N proteins of other coronaviruses makes it difficult to link the data obtained from those coronaviruses to the understanding of structures and functions of SARS-CoV N protein, and may even intricate the rationalization of anti-SARS design. To facilitate investigations on the functional roles of SARS-CoV replication we set out to determine whether there is an existence of SARS-CoV N-N self-interaction, by using both yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems, in addition to the mapping of the amino acid sequences responsible for protein multimerization.",

Notably, no such interaction was observed for another viral protein, M, and consistent results were obtained in both yeast and mammalian twohybrid systems, ruling out the possibility that identification of the N self-interaction was due to experimental deviation.

Sub-cellular localization of the viral protein is widely used to characterize the involvement of the protein in the virus assembly [22] [23] [24] [25] . In addition, we also found that deletion of the SR-motif in the N protein resulted in a dramatic change of the sub-cellular localization of the N protein compared to the wild type, further implicating that this motif could be important for viral replication (Fig. 5) . Our search for similar protein domains in public protein database (Entrez and ExPASy) yielded little information pertaining to known functional activities associated with similar aa sequences. In MHV (Accession No. NC-001846), a similar motif in the N gene shares only 46% homology with what we have found to be critical for N-N interaction in SARS-CoV. However, it is unknown whether those amino acids are involved in MHV N-N interaction. Clearly, further studies on these residues with respect to the exact mechanism involved in N self-interaction are necessary, and are ongoing in our laboratories.",

            "text": "The functional roles of SARS-CoV N in viral replication and disease development remain largely unknown. We recently reported that the N protein can selectively activate AP-1 pathway [10] , suggesting that the virus has encoded a strategy to regulate cellular signaling processes. A variety of functional activities have been ascribed to the nucleocapsid protein of other known coronaviruses, including virion assembly, and RNA-dependent RNA transcription and translation [3, 27, 28] . Noticeably, N protein self-association may be important for initiating RNP (ribonucleoprotein) formation leading to encapsidation [26, 27, 29] . As SARS-CoV has a remote phylogenetic relationship with other known coronaviruses, vigorous studies on the genetics and functions of SARS-CoV structural proteins are necessary to fully elucidate the mechanisms involving SARS-CoV replication. In this report, we presented the data that SARS-CoV N protein has intrinsic properties of self-interaction, and that a region rich in serine and arginine residues has been found to be critical for the N protein multimerization.",
