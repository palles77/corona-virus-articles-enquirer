Related to this, the number of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures performed each year in Taiwan has increased 3-fold, from approximately 100 in 1988 to 356 in 1999. 1, 2 Historically, CHD has been associated with men, but there has been an increasing number of women with CHD, and the mortality rate for women with the disease is greater than that for men. 3 One reason for the higher mortality rate of women is suggested by Higginson, 4 who reported that women tend to delay the seeking of help for reasons, such as not recognizing symptoms or preferring to self-medicate. In Taiwan, 4323 women died of CHD in 2003, and the mortality rate for women is 2 to 3 times greater than for any kind of cancer. 5 Thus, it is important to recruit women for cardiac-related research, particularly for the purpose of determining whether there are gender differences.",

            "text": "Because recovery from CABG is a stressful experience, coping strategies are required to achieve adaptation. 6, 7 According to Lazarus and Folkman's 8 adaptation theory, there are 2 forms of coping: problem focused and emotion focused. Problemfocused coping involves finding a solution to a problem. 8 When individuals believe that nothing can be done to solve a problem, however, they use emotion-focused coping, such as avoidance or wishful thinking to alleviate stress. 8, 9 Recent research has demonstrated that Lazarus and Folkman's adaptation theory is compatible with Chinese culture. The Chinese Yin-Yang perspective, which includes the notion of allowing fate to take its course, can be understood as similar to emotion-focused coping because, in the Yin-Yang perspective, a threat is reduced by having faith and achieving a sense of peace. Although Chinese cultural beliefs remain important to the Chinese people, they are not the only concepts that guide an individual's thoughts and behavior. Because of the industrialization and Westernization seen in recent decades, the Chinese have learned to take an active role in expressing their individual needs, which can be understood as a form of problem-focused coping. Moreover, research has shown that problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies, as categorized by Lazarus and Folkman, were used by Taiwanese patients with cardiac disease. [10] [11] [12] [13] In regard to gender differences in coping after CABG surgery, research has revealed that men, compared with women, used more problem-focused coping and less emotion-focused coping to manage the stress of a cardiac event. [10] [11] [12] [13] Kristofferzon et al 14 reported no statistically significant changes in coping over time in either men or women at 1, 4, and 12 months after myocardial infarction, except for fatalistic coping, which diminished over time in men. They also found that women used more evasive coping than did men at 4 and 12 months after the cardiac event. In addition, confrontational coping was shown to have positive outcomes over the long term. The current investigation not only determined whether there are gender differences in coping but also examined the relationship between coping and anxiety across demographics and role function.",

Another study, however, contradicted this notion, finding that Chinese patients with cancer took an active role in seeking information and perceived communication with health professionals as beneficial. 40 Similar results, identified seeking help as the most frequently used strategy, have been reported in previous research with Chinese patients with chronic heart failure, 13 Taiwanese patients undergoing heart surgery, 12 and Taiwanese patients undergoing cardiac transplant surgery. 10 In the present study, both Taiwanese male and female patients post-CABG used more problem-focused coping rather than emotion-focused coping to deal with their stress. Among problem-focused coping strategies, Taiwanese patients post-CABG tend to spent time focusing on problem solving instead of seeking help. This may be explained by the fact that the patient has family caregivers or that they are trying to save face. Redeker 7 found that men tend to use more problem-focused coping than do women. However, Maxwell and Siu 41 stated that females use more active coping and social support and that males experienced more anger during the adaptation process. The current study, however, found that there was no difference in coping behavior, except that women tended to use more blaming of self than did men. In Chinese culture, women are usually those who take care of the whole family, including parents-in-law. Thus, women could tend to feel guilty and blame themselves when they are not able to take responsibility of taking care their family members or when they cause others to worry about them.",
