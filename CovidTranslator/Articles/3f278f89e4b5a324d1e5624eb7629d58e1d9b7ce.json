Zoonotic infections (i.e. Hendra, swine flu, anthrax) affect animal health and can be deadly to humans. The increasing rate of outbreaks of infectious diseases transferring from animals to humans (i.e. zoonotic diseases) necessitates detailed understanding of the education, research and practice of animal health and its connection to human health. These emerging microbial threats underline the need to exploring the evolutionary dynamics of zoonotic research across public health and animal health. This study investigates the collaboration network of different countries engaged in conducting zoonotic research. We explore the dynamics of this network from 1980 to 2012 based on large scientific data developed from Scopus. In our analyses, we compare several properties of the network including density, clustering coefficient, giant component and centrality measures over time. We also map the network over different time intervals using VOSviewer. We analyzed 5182 publication records. We found United States and United Kingdom as the most collaborative countries working with 110 and 74 other countries in 1048 and 599 cases, respectively. Our results show increasing close collaboration among scientists from the",

Therefore, successful management of zoonotic diseases risks and outbreaks require the understanding of the complex interaction network of humans, animals and their living environments (WHO 2013b) . Previous bibliometric studies on relevant topics either investigated specific infectious diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Patra and Chand 2007; Uthman 2008) , tuberculosis (Ramos et al. 2008) , and malaria (Garg et al. 2009 ) or examined infectious diseases in general (Bliziotis et al. 2005; Ramos et al. 2004 Ramos et al. , 2009 Takahashi-Omoe and Omoe 2012) . The latter studies examined the research productivity and contribution of different countries and regions of the world in infectious diseases showing a gradual increase in research on infectious diseases in the US, the EU and other regions in the world. Our investigation focuses on the contribution and collaboration of countries in exploring the intersection between animal and human health. We provide an investigation of the dynamics of zoonotic research networks over 33 years by constructing and using large scientometric data.",

In order to minimize any missed out document and to account for any important keyword that was not included in the first stage, another set of keywords were identified to run a second round of search. As such, in the second stage, the keywords used in the extracted publications from the first stage were analyzed for their frequency. The frequency analysis of the keywords included identifying the most frequent ''single word'' and ''multiple words'' keywords. The latter keywords were the original keywords used by the authors and the former keywords were produced by splitting the ''multiple words'' ones.

VOSviewer provides both mapping and clustering of networks (especially bibliometric networks) in a unified approach as an alternative to combing the mapping and clustering techniques with different assumptions. Its clustering technique is based on a weighted and parameterized variation of modularity-based clustering, and it uses visualization of similarities (VOS) as its mapping technique . VOS is a distance-based mapping technique rather than a graph-based one. While in the latter technique the distance between two nodes is not necessarily meaningful, in the former technique this distance represents the strength of their relationship (van Eck and Waltman 2010). VOSviewer provides different visualizations of networks. In the label views, the size of a nodes' circle and label portray its importance. Larger circles and labels represent more important nodes in terms of their weight (van Eck and Waltman 2013). The weight of the nodes in the countries networks in our study are determined based on the number of other countries associated with them and the strength of the associations. The color of the circles also depicts the cluster the node belongs to (van Eck and Waltman 2013) . The density view is helpful for identifying the most important areas of a map. In this view, the nodes are represented with the same label structure as the label view. The color of the point a node is placed in depends on the number of nodes around that point and their weights (i.e. their density). More nodes with greater weight neighboring a node lead to greater density for that node. According to the default color scheme used by VOSviewer, three color (redgreen-blue) represent density where red and blue are assigned to the highest and lowest densities respectively (van Eck and Waltman 2010).",

While before 1991, the number of extracted publications is constantly low, an increasing trend starts after that. This increase in the number of publications continues gradually and accelerates after 2002. This observation provides three time intervals to examine detail changes in the collaboration networks including 1980-1990, 1991-2001, and 2002-2012 . The dynamic analysis in this study focuses on the last two time intervals as the number of publications in the first period is limited. Another interesting point of time in Fig. 2 is 2006 . Up to this year the number of publications is increasing but this upward trend halts here with occasional rises. To have a better understanding of the possible underlying reasons for such a trend in the zoonotic research output, the frequency of zoonotic research publications and WHO's disease outbreak news per year (WHO 2013a) since 1996 are depicted in Fig. 3 .",

It seems that the output of scientific research in the zoonotic disease outbreaks have reached a saturation level since 2006 and only occurrence of global disease outbreaks triggers increases in quantity of the related publications. As such, the changes of zoonotic research collaboration networks will also be examined for another two periods including 1999-2005 and 2006-2012.

The first instances of international collaboration start from 1995 and steadily increase although the number of collaboration links among countries experiences some rises and falls over the years. The highest amount of collaborations (324 distinct links and 569 total occurrences) takes place in 2011 among 71 countries. In 2012, the amount of collaborations drops to 261 distinct collaboration ties while the number of participating countries increases to 80. Since 2006-2012 the collaborating countries consist of 53-80 countries which are nearly 50 % of all the countries (159) in our database. In other words, the countries collaboration network at its most collaborative status comprises half of the publishing countries. In addition, the trend of recruiting more collaborating countries each year although is overall growing; its pace slows down after 2006. However, the number of collaboration links between the present countries and the frequency of such collaborations shows fast increase (with occasional declines). As such, it seems that after 2006 the community of collaborating countries is more focused on having more collaboration with other existing countries in the community and strengthening these collaborative relationships.",

In addition, the high clustering coefficient (71.1 %) implies the high possibility of collaboration among two adjacent countries of a third country. Figure 5a , pertaining to this period, illustrates this implication in the form of several triangles in the network. The network also has a giant component and several other small components. The network's degree of centrality is average (48.1 %). As shown in Fig. 5a , the countries are gathered around a few central nodes in the network including the United States and United Kingdom.

South Africa, Germany, and Italy (overlaid by Germany in the map illustration), and France are the next countries with large labels which indicate their importance in the zoonotic research in this period. There is also a split evident in the map which separates countries around United States from countries around United Kingdom. In other words, there is low density between the two areas.

There is also a slight improvement in the clustering coefficient value (73.2 %). The degree centrality shows considerable improvement (62.3 %). As shown in Fig. 5b , the countries are coming closer together compared to the previous period. The network closeness and the betweenness have decreased. The high value of closeness (73.3 %) and low value of betweenness (33.0 %) measures implies the low distance between the countries. The network measure for the whole period of time is similar to the second time period, which is expected given that most of the publications belong to this period. Similar trend in the values of the network measures are observed in the other two periods (1999-2005 and 2006-2012) . The interesting observation here together with the information from Fig. 4 is the high value of clustering coefficient (71.8 %), density (8.3 %) and degree centrality (60.6 %) in 2006-2012 period which indicates the high probability that two collaborators of a country will be collaborating with each other and countries having more collaborations and collaborators. These values are higher than the seven years before 2006. In other words, in the recent years, the countries were putting more effort in strengthening their relationship with more other countries (see Figs. 6a, b) .",

In addition, the number of countries they collaborate with exceeds the others. Italy, France and Netherland are the next most collaborative countries; although France's collaborating countries (70) are slightly more than Italy (68). This result complements previous studies on the output of infectious disease research community. Previous studies show that the United States and the western European countries productivity exceed the other countries in terms of publication on infectious disease research (Bliziotis et al. 2005; Takahashi-Omoe and Omoe 2012) , and United Kingdom, France, and Germany lead the European countries in terms of number of publication on this topic (Ramos et al. 2004 (Ramos et al. , 2009 ). Our results show a similar pattern in terms of collaboration efforts on zoonotic research. The United States, United Kingdom, France, Italy and Netherlands are the leading collaborative countries in zoonotic research.

The overall properties of these networks as well as their dynamics over these 33 years are examined in detail. The countries network shows steady increase in collaboration among different countries. The United States is the most collaborative country having links with 110 countries and 1048 total instances of collaborations. Several European countries including United Kingdom, Italy, France, Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany and Belgium are among the top ten collaborating countries. China and Australia are also among the ten most collaborating countries. Nevertheless, the density of the network is still low which means that limited numbers of countries are collaborating. However, this trend is improving such that almost half of the 159 countries had at least one collaboration link in the recent years. In addition, in spite of the recent lower rate of addition of more countries into the network, within the current network, the countries are increasingly initiating new collaborations as well as enhancing these collaborating relations (strengthening them).",
