It's worth noting that there was a definite sex difference in the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. According to the recent data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the ratio of male infection to female infection reached 2.7:1 1 . Among 72314 patients in China, the morbidity and case-fatality rates (CFR) (48.6% and 1.7%) of women were significantly lower than those of men (51.4%, 2.8%). More deaths were found in males than females (63.8% over 36.2%) 2 . The mortality rate of women aged 15-49, under the average menopausal age 50, was even lower. These results indicate that females are less susceptible than males, and have better outcomes.",

This was confirmed in animal experiments, showing that estrogen mitigates the susceptibility and the severity of phenotype for SARS-CoV, while ovariectomy or intervention with estrogen receptor inhibitors increased the mortality of female mice 5 . An anti-virus drug study showed that estrogen receptor inhibitors possess a great potency in antiviral activity screening against MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and other RNA virus, and they also have an anti-Ebola virus effect in mice 6 . These studies suggest that E2 might play a protective role in SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection with lower susceptibility, severity and better outcomes of their corresponding diseases.

Logistics regression analyses showed that the levels of E2 and AMH in non-severe group are higher than that of the severe group, which may play vital roles in the progression of COVID-19. In this study, non-severe females have higher levels of testosterone than do severe patients. Previous studies have shown that testosterone has suppressive effects on immune system, such as on cytokine production and lymphocyte proliferation 17 . However, after adjusted by age, the significance became unobvious. In the disease progression of COVID-19, testosterone may work by suppressing immune storms.

Several clinical studies reported that levels of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, including IL-6, IL-8, IFN-\u03b3, MCP-1, and IP-10, are highly increased in patients with SARS, some of which were correlated with ARDS, respiratory syncytial virus infections and human infection by avian influenza viruses 20, 21 .

Second, the serum E2 level was just from once blood sample regardless of phase of menstrual cycle, so that the results may not completely reflect the average E2 level and its effects. In order to alleviate this error, we divided menstrual cycle into follicular and luteal phase when analyzed with E2. Third, the sample size of serum sex hormones, 78, might not be large enough.

Information recorded included exposure history, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory findings, chest computed tomographic (CT) scans and clinical outcome data. All laboratory testing was performed according to the clinical care needs of the patient. Laboratory tests included a complete blood count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ferritin, immunoproteins including immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), complement 3 (C3) and C4, cytokines including IL-1\u03b2, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1. The clinical outcomes (i.e., discharge, mortality, admission to ICU, mechanical ventilation, or death) were monitored up to March 8, 2020.",

The effects of E2 on the immune system are mainly due to its concentration, distribution, and different expression of two main estrogen receptor-ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 in various lymphoid cells. E2 was involved in both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. E2 can also initiate the differentiation from monocytes into inflammatory dendritic cells by regulating the expression of cytokines and chemokines and promote greater internalization and antigen presentation to naive T cells 26 . Thus, E2 may be a protective factor for female COVID -19 patients by regulation of cytokines or immunoproteins such as IL2R, IL6, IL8, TNF\u03b1 and C3. Female symptoms severity and outcomes may change during times of hormone fluctuation.",
