In this study, we firstly verified that 17 SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as a cell receptor and its spike (S) protein mediates high 18 membrane fusion activity. Comparing to that of SARS-CoV, the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) 19 sequence in the S2 fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 possesses markedly increased \u03b1-helicity 20 and thermostability, as well as a higher binding affinity with its corresponding heptad repeat 2 21 (HR1) site. Then, we designed a HR2 sequence-based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor, termed 22 IPB02, which showed highly poent activities in inibibiting the SARS-CoV-2 S 23 protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus infection. IPB02 also inhibited the 24 SARS-CoV pseudovirus efficiently. Moreover, the strcuture and activity relationship (SAR) 25 of IPB02 were characterzized with a panel of truncated lipopeptides, revealing the amino acid 26 motifs critical for its binding and antiviral capacities. Therefore, the presented results have 27 provided important information for understanding the entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 and the 28 design of antivirals that target the membrane fusion step.",

In this study, we focused on 201 developing viral fusion inhibitor peptides with a potent and broad antiviral activity. Firstly, 202 our experiments verified that like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also uses human 203 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for cell entry and infection; however, 204 the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has much higher activity to mediate cell-cell fusion.

According to our experiences in designing of 212 lipopeptide fusion inhibitor against HIV, we modified the HR2 sequence-derived peptide 213 IPB01 with a cholesterol group, resulting in the lipopeptide IPB02 with highly potent 214 activities in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses as well as the S 215 protein-mediated cell-cell fusion activity. Moreover, the structure-activity relationship (SAR) 216 of the HR2 sequence-based fusion inhibitors were characterized by applying a panel of 217 truncated lipopeptides, which certified the roles of both the N-and C-terminal amino acid 218 sequences in the design of a potent inhibitor against emerging CoVs. Combined, these data 219 provide important information for understanding the fusion mechanism of emerging CoVs 220 and for the development of antivirals that target the membrane fusion step. 221 Cell entry of CoVs depends on binding of the viral S proteins to cellular receptors and on 222 S protein priming by host cell proteases (41-44). Previous studies demonstrated that 223 SARS-CoV enters into targeting cells mainly via an endosome membrane fusion pathway 224 where its S protein is cleaved by endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB/L) 225 and activated (45). However, SARS-CoV also employs the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 226 for S protein priming, and especially, TMPRSS2 but not CatB/L is essential for viral entry 227 into primary target cells and for viral spread in the infected host (43, 46-48). It was also found 228 that introducing a furin-recognition site between the S1 and S2 subunits could significantly 229 increase the ability of SARS-CoV S protein to mediate cellular membrane surface infection 230 (49).

A 236 recent study found that SARS-CoV-2 employs TMPRSS2 for S protein priming and a 237 TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use can block entry (52). For most viruses, the 238 plasma membrane fusion pathway is more efficient than the endosome membrane fusion 239 pathway because the latter is prone to activating the host antiviral immunity (53, 54). In this 240 study, we have not only verified ACE2 as a cell receptor but also demonstrated that the 241 SARS-CoV-2 S protein evolves a significantly increased fusogenic activity relative to the S 242 protein of SARS-CoV. Although our studies have also shown that the HR1 mutations in the 243 S2 protein can greatly enhance the HR1-HR2 interaction thus might be a crucial factor to 244 determine the fusion activity of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, other players in the fusion 245 pathways may contribute in coordination with that. We also observed that the HR2-derived 246 inhibitors were more effective in inhibiting the S protein-mediated cell fusion than their 247 inhibitions on pseudoviruses, implying that SARS-CoV-2 might also adopt the endosome 248 entry pathway. Indeed, it was recently found that cathepsin L is required for the cell entry of 249 SARS-CoV-2 and teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, can specifically inhibit the entry (55,250 56).",
