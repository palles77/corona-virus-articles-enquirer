We compared PPPase assays on rat material, including extracts of neonatal brain, primary olijodendrocytes and a defined endosomal fraction from olilodendrocyte x C6 astrocytoma Roc-I cells, with endosomes from L-2 cells. Since it is impossible to determine from which particular cell type endosomes originate when starting with the heterogenous cell population in brain tissue and was not possible to obtain a sufficient number of purified primary oligodendrocytes for isolating endosomes, we were unable to obtain any data directly on endosomal PPPase in these two materials. It Is, however, evident from Fig, 4 , that homogenates from brain and primary olit~odendrocytes contained respec. tively about 5 and 12 times more PPPase, per 50 lag prorein, than Ilomogenates of L-2 cells. Assays made on liver and kidney tissue homogenates demonstrated that the comparable PPPaseactivities, 1,5070 and 2070 respectively, were lower than those in brain and approximated those found in whole homogenates of L-2 cells, The endosomal preparations from L'2 and Roe-1 cells con, tained comparable PPPase activity. Therefore, the PPPase which may play a role in the infection of the CNS by JHMV is abundantly active in neural cells.",

Activation of this PPPase in the presence of detergent suggests that the enzyme is latent, perhaps residing on the endosomal membrane rather than in the fluid milieu of the endosome. It has not been established whether the PPPase occurs at the external or cytoplasmic face of this organelle. The presumed role for a neutral PPPase localized in endosomes during early virus-cell interactions is consistent with clear evidence that coronaviruses, unlike many other enveloped agents, do not pass through an acidic compartment to initiate their infectious cycles [8] . It is, of course, well established that contents of endosomal vesicles progress from neutral to an acidic milieu as these organelles migrate from the surface towards the interior where, due to membrane fusions and proton pumps they become prelysosomes, then lysosomes with an acidic content [28, 29] . The RNA genomes of coronaviruses may gain access into the cytosol near the cell surface, conceivably soon after inoculum virions have been sequestered inside early endosomes. Thus a neutral PPPase concentrated in early endosomes would be in a strategic position to dephosphorylate the coronavirus N component of nucleocapsids after internalization of the inoculum virions.",

This idea led us to hypothesize that the PPPase activity, described here, initiates dissociation of N from the nucleocapsid so as to promote uncoatin~t of the RNA. The role of the PPPase may also be of relevance in infections within the CNFI, where JHMV is specifically tropic for cells of the oligodendrocytic lineage both in young rats and CNS \u00a2xplants [5] , Susceptibility to JHMV infection is lost when the progenitors acquire the phenotype of mature oligodendrocytes. The block due to matu ration, which is apparent subsequent to attachment and sequestration, could involve the uncoating step, The nonpermissive state of mature oligodendrocytes for JHMV could be related to the cAMP dependent protein kinase metabolism, specifically involving a notable upregulation of the regulatory subunit RI of protein kinase type I [30]. Since RI can suppress the endosomal PPPase when added to an in vitro assay system [31], there appeared to exist in oligodendrocytes an interrelationship between induction of R and inhibition of the endosomal PPPase. The consequence of reduced PPPase activity in oligodendrocytes might be an adverse effect on the uncoating of JHMV affecting viral expression in the CNS.",
