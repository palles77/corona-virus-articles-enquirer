Epitope-scaffolds are a new class of antigens engineered by transplanting viral epitopes of pre-defined structure to protein scaffolds, or by building protein scaffolds around such epitopes. Epitope-scaffolds are of interest as vaccine components to attempt to elicit neutralizing antibodies targeting the specified epitope. In this study we developed a new computational protocol, MultiGraft Interface, that transplants epitopes but also designs additional scaffold features outside the epitope to enhance antibody-binding specificity and potentially influence the specificity of elicited antibodies. We employed MultiGraft Interface to engineer novel epitope-scaffolds that display the known epitope of HIV-1 neutralizing antibody 2F5 and that also interact with the functionally important CDR H3 antibody loop. MultiGraft Interface generated an epitope-scaffold that bound 2F5 with sub-nanomolar affinity (K D = 400 pM) and that interacted with the antibody CDR H3 loop through computationally designed contacts. Substantial structural modifications were necessary to engineer this antigen, with the 2F5 epitope replacing a helix in the native scaffold and with 15% of the native scaffold sequence being modified in the design stage. This epitope-scaffold represents a successful example of rational protein backbone engineering and protein-protein interface design and could prove useful in the field of HIV vaccine design. MultiGraft Interface can be generally applied to engineer novel binding partners with altered specificity and optimized affinity. \u00a7",

For a given binding motif, MultiGraft automatically identifies suitable \"scaffold\" proteins in the Protein Data Bank 11 \"grafts\" the motif onto the scaffolds and subsequently optimizes the interactions both between the epitope and the scaffold and between the scaffold and the desired binding partner. We previously used MultiGraft to design novel antigens, called epitope-scaffolds, by transferring the epitopes of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) 5, 6, 8, 12 and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) 13 to suitable scaffold proteins. Epitope-scaffolds are of interest as potential vaccine components to attempt to induce neutralizing antibodies specific for the specified epitope, and present potential advantages over traditional viral-derived immunogens, such as the presentation of the epitope in its antibody-bound state and in an environment devoid of any immune evasion mechanisms that are encoded in natural viral proteins. Recently, epitopescaffolds displaying a neutralization epitope from RSV elicited neutralizing responses from macaques 7 demonstrating that epitope-scaffolds can be viable immunogens and encouraging the development of similar antigens for other broadly neutralizing antibodies.",

            "text": "Epitope-scaffolds for three bnAbs against HIV-1 (4E10, b12 and 2F5) were previously described 5, 6, 8, 12 . Despite their high affinity for the respective antibodies, to date none of these epitope-scaffolds has elicited neutralizing responses against HIV-1 when tested as immunogens in animal studies. Multiple factors potentially contribute to their failure to induce detectable neutralizing activity 14 . Recently, auto-antigens have been identified for the 2F5 and 4E10 antibodies, indicating that literal \"re-elicitation\" of 2F5 or 4E10 might be blocked by tolerance mechanisms 15 . However, the odds of re-creating the recombination events and mutational pathways that led to 2F5 or 4E10 are extremely low, and in general we expect to induce a polyclonal response against either of these epitopes. Indeed, 2F5 epitope-scaffolds succeeded to induce mouse antibodies that are genetically unrelated to 2F5 but that bind to a nearly identical conformation of the 2F5 peptide epitope 12 . Furthermore, a highly potent HIV bnAb called 10E8 has been shown to lack the autoreactive characteristics of 4E10 while binding to essentially the same epitope 16 . Thus we do not believe that tolerance mechanisms are sufficient to explain the failure to induce neutralizing antibodies with epitope-scaffolds for the 2F5 or 4E10 epitopes. An alternate potential explanation is that these epitope-scaffolds do not fully recapitulate the viral epitopes required for neutralization. In that case, these epitope-scaffolds may be unable to stimulate and drive the maturation of B cell populations capable of secreting such broadly neutralizing antibodies.",

Recent studies however demonstrated that 2F5 also interacts with the virus outside this well-characterized region. These additional contacts are mediated by the long, hydrophobic CDR H3 loop of the antibody and may involve non-specific hydrophobic contacts with the viral membrane 17, 18 or interactions with other viral protein regions especially within gp41 19 . Interactions between the CDR H3 loop of 2F5 and HIV-1 are essential for viral neutralization as changes in either the length or the hydrophobic character of the loop significantly lower the neutralization potency of 2F5 20,21 . As noted above, one structurally characterized antibody elicited by existing 2F5 epitope-scaffolds lacked a long CDR H3 loop and showed no neutralization ability, despite fully recapitulating the interactions between 2F5 and its gp41 peptide epitope 12 . This further suggests that long CDR H3 loops are critical for viral neutralization via mechanisms similar to the one employed by 2F5. Given that none of the existing epitope-scaffolds interact with the CDR H3 loop of 2F5, here we developed novel 2F5 epitope-scaffolds that not only display the gp41 peptide epitope on their surface, but that also interact with this critical antibody loop. By presenting a de novo designed binding surface for the 2F5 CDR H3 loop, it was hypothesized that these new epitope-scaffolds would make additional contacts to 2F5 through its CDR H3. It was also hoped that, as immunogens, these new scaffolds might induce neutralizing antibodies that bind not only to the 2F5 peptide epitope but also utilize long CDR H3 loops to engage the CDR H3-complementarity patch.",

For a given binding motif, MultiGraft Interface: i) identifies suitable protein scaffolds that can accommodate the motif and that can be engineered to make additional interactions with the binding partner; ii) structurally alters the identified scaffold to integrate the bound conformation of the motif and iii) builds additional interactions to a user-defined region of the binding partner outside the native interface ( Fig.  1 ). This protocol led to the development of an epitope-scaffold that binds 2F5 with higher affinity (K D =400 pM) than any gp41-derived peptides or previously described epitopescaffolds. Mutagenesis analysis showed that this antigen interacts specifically with the antibody CDR H3 loop through computationally designed contacts. Aggressive structural remodeling was necessary to engineer this molecule: the 2F5 epitope replaced a native helix in the original scaffold structure and the identity of 15% of the native residues was modified. The successful design of this epitope-scaffold underscores the ability of MultiGraft Interface to rationally engineer protein backbone structure and to design de novo protein-protein interactions, two areas of great interest in the field of computational protein design. Outside antigen engineering, Multigraft Interface is generally capable of designing binding partners with higher affinity or altered specificity and could be applied to develop novel protein inhibitors or biological probes.",

The procedure to identify proteins that could both accommodate a given binding site and interact with a region of their binding partner outside the native interface consists of two steps: 1) the PDB is first queried to find scaffolds that can display the motif on their surface, as was previously described for the design of epitope-scaffolds by side-chain grafting 5 or backbone grafting 6, 8 ; 2) once a potential scaffold passes the imposed criteria, a newly implemented spatial filter is employed to filter candidates by the calculated the number of scaffold residues located within a user-defined distance to the targeted interaction region on the binding partner. To speed up the calculations, the identification stage was done using a version of the candidate scaffold where the identity of all non-glycine residues was changed to alanine. The binding motif (epitope) is positioned on the scaffold such that it replaces the corresponding native scaffold region as defined by the alignment at the matching stage. An all-alanine version of the binding partner (antibody) is represented at this stage and the potential complex between scaffold and partner is modeled. Rough energetic filters are used to assess the potential interaction between scaffold and binding partner in-silico. For a modeled binding complex at this stage, the spatial filter implemented in MultiGraft Interface counts the number of C \u03b2 atoms on a potential scaffold located within a user-specified distance from the target interaction region on the binding partner. This number is subsequently used as an exclusion criterion for candidate scaffold selected for the design round.",

Scaffold residues located within a user-defined distance from the interaction region are designed by iterating three times through the following automatic protocol: i) the identity of the residues is allowed to change to any other amino acid except cysteine; ii) the side chains at the binding interface and the rigid body orientation of the binding partner are simultaneously minimized 22 .

Two additional filters, to evaluate potential clashes between the epitope backbone and the scaffold (intraclash<100 Rosetta energy units) or between the antibody and the scaffold region outside the epitope (interclash<100 Rosetta energy units), were used to further reduce the number of candidate scaffolds. To identify scaffolds that could provide additional contacts to the CDR H3 loop of the 2F5 mAb, a spatial filter was then used to select only those scaffolds that had between 2 and 10 C \u03b2 atoms within 5.5 \u00c5 of the 2F5 mAb CDR H3 loop as defined by the sequence 100A LFGVPI 100F (PDBid: 1tji numbering) of the 2F5 heavy chain. This filter was important to identify regions of potential scaffolds where additional contacts to the CDR H3 could be engineered at subsequent stages of the protocol. From over 10,000 unique protein structures initially queried, 323 potential scaffolds based on 202 unique structures were selected for the design stage.",

Briefly, i) the epitope replaced the native scaffold backbone as determined in the identification or \"matching\" stage; ii) de novo backbone regions were built and scaffold polypeptide regions adjacent to the epitope were altered to connect the epitope to the rest of the scaffold; iii) sequence changes were introduced to accommodate the novel backbone conformation around the epitope region and to add interaction between the epitope and the scaffold; iv) the 2F5-scaffold complex was modeled and additional sequence changes were introduced in the scaffold to remove any potential clashes. In the second part of the design stage, MultiGraft Interface introduced an additional sequence optimization routine focused on engineering scaffold contacts to the CDR H3 loop of the antibody. The identities of scaffold residues with sidechain atoms located within 4 \u00c5 of the CDR H3 loop were computationally redesigned to identify potential CDR H3-scaffold contacts. Resulting epitope-scaffolds were evaluated based on a Rosetta-calculated binding energy between 2F5 and the epitope-scaffold, the length of the displayed epitope range, the dihedral angles of the remodeled scaffold backbone, the interactions of the epitope with the rest of the scaffold, and the interactions between the epitope-scaffold and the CDR H3 loop. Finally, after visual inspection of the selected models, one additional round of human-guided computational sequence design was performed to correct any obvious defects in the computational models (such as solvent exposed hydrophobic groups, buried hydrogen donor or acceptor groups, undesired nonepitope mediated contacts to the antibody) and to further optimize the interactions between the grafted epitope and the 2F5 CDR H3 loop with the scaffold.",

This strategy allowed simultaneous examination and optimization of 10 3 -10 4 constructs based on each of the four parent proteins. The directed libraries attempted to optimize both the interaction of the epitope on the scaffold and of the engineered contacts to the CDR H3 loop. This concurrent optimization is important given that the position of the epitope relative to the scaffold affects the binding orientation of 2F5, which in turn affects the interaction of the CDR H3 loop with the scaffold. Furthermore, previous studies showed that the CDR H3 loop of 2F5 is flexible is solution 29 and the scaffolds themselves will sample scaffold-specific conformational variations in solution, therefore the CDR H3 conformation and interaction mode with the scaffolds might differ from the design models. Therefore, this experimental screening procedure attempted to account for the intrinsic flexibility of the CDR H3 loop and for imperfections present in the designed models.",

None of the resulting proteins were expressed and it was thus concluded that the native proteins could not tolerate the sequence changes introduced during the computational design stage.

As reported by Guenaga et. al. 31 these antibody variants had the same affinity as WT 2F5 for ES2, a previously described epitope-scaffold 12 that stabilizes the 2F5-bound conformation of the gp41 peptide epitope on its surface. However, 2F5_e2 and 2F5_r2 had more that 10-fold reduced affinity compared to WT 2F5 towards a gp41 peptide fragment that adopts a helical conformation in solution. The CDR H3 loop is not thought to interact directly with the epitope peptide, based on lack of contacts between the CDR H3 and the peptide in co-crystal structures, however the peptide binding differences in the mutated 2F5 constructs were attributed to a potential role for the CDR H3 to induce an extended-loop conformation of the gp41 epitope 18 . Given that 1dwu_CM was engineered to display the bound conformation of gp41 on its surface, minimal structural reorganization of the epitope region should be necessary upon binding to 2F5, 2F5_e2 or 2F5_r2. Therefore, we anticipated that the antibody interactions through the epitope would be similar for all three 2F5 variants and that any measured binding differences would be primarily due to different interaction modes of the CDR H3 loops with 1dwu_CM. 2F5_e2 and 2F5_r2 bound 1dwu_CM with 8-fold (K D = 6 nM) and 16-fold (K D = 13 nM) lower affinities, respectively, than wild-type 2F5, indicating that the binding interactions were sensitive to the length of the CDR H3 loop. The binding affinities of 1dwu_CM_K95A for 2F5_e2 and 2F5_r2 (K D > 40\u00b5M in both cases ) were lower than the affinity of 1dwu_CM for 2F5 by a factor of >10 5 demonstrating that both the native 2F5 paratope and the CDR H3 loop represent the major sites of scaffold interactions with the antibody.",

Five residues were accordingly mutated in 1dwu_CM (K25S, F27D, A160H, S201K, A203T) while another four residues (F22, I29, L162, P207) were kept unchanged since they had the same identity in 1dwu_CM and the native scaffold.

Phe27 is located at the core of the interaction, and mutating it to alanine or glutamate decreased the binding affinity of 1dwu_CM by 7-fold (K D = 2.8 nM) and 9-fold respectively (K D = 3.7 nM). Ser201 was shown to play a key role in the interaction with the CDR H3 loop. Mutation of Ser201 to alanine reduced the 2F5 affinity of 1dwu_CM by 25-fold (K D =10nM). While Ser201 is predicted to be centrally located at the computationally modeled CDR H3-1dwu_CM interface, it is predicted to contribute only a small binding area (12 \u00c5 2 ) and it is not predicted to form any polar interactions with the CDR H3 loop. Nevertheless, the significant effect of the S201A substitution on the 2F5 affinity indicates that Ser201 may make additional polar and/or van der Waals interactions with the CDR H3 loop that are not captured in the computational model. To further confirm the position of S201 relative to the CDR H3 loop, we mutated it to Leu and showed that the 2F5 affinity of the resulting construct was 300-fold (K D = 140 nM) lower than that of 1dwu_CM. This loss of binding is probably due to a clash between the introduced leucine and the CDR H3 loop, although such a clash is not predicted in the computational model. Interestingly, mutating residue Tyr199 to Ala lowered the affinity of 1dwu_CM for 2F5 by 10-fold (K D = 4.7 nM). In the computational model, Tyr199 is located at the periphery of the epitope-scaffold-CDR H3 loop interface, 8 \u00c5 from residue Phe107 B of the antibody. However, it may be possible for Tyr199 to contact the tip of the CDR H3 if the side chain of Tyr199 adopted a different conformation or if the CDR H3 loop were more extended than in the model.",

Using Rosetta, binding interface residues were independently changed to alanine, and the total binding energy of the resulting 1dwu_CM-2F5 models was calculated. Changes in both CDR H3 and 1dwu_CM interface residues led to a decrease in computed binding energy (Table S1 ). However, the magnitude of the changes was small for each individual residue at the interface, and did not correlate with the significant binding contributions of residues Phe27 or Ser201 measured experimentally. It is important to note that his may be due to the lack of sensitivity in the Rosetta scoring function in our case, due to either the intrinsic characteristics of the biological system used or to the computational protocol employed (see Supplementary Computational Methods). It may also be due to the fact that our computational modeling is not attempting to capture an explicit role for waters in the binding interaction. Epitope mutations known to reduce the affinity to 2F5 by a factor of 10000 or more (D664A, K665A, W666A; PDBId: 1tji numbering) result in binding energy decreases of 2.4 to 4.9 Rosetta energy units compared to the binding energy of the wild type epitope to the antibody.

In previous immunization experiments with more than ten different 2F5 epitope-scaffolds, ES5 elicited the strongest antibody responses that cross-reacted with the HIV gp41 peptide, although no viral neutralizing activity was detected (references 12, 32 and not shown). Here, serum samples were collected 10 days after each inoculation and sera reactivity was measured against the epitope-scaffolds themselves to determine if the scaffolds were immunogenic. Both 1dwu_CM and ES5 generated robust autologous antibody titers (Fig. S3, top) .

The antibody 2F5 binds equally to both peptides 18 and thus 2F5-like antibodies should also display this behavior. 1dwu_CM immunized animals generated gp41 specific antibodies that recognized both peptides to the same degree as the antibody 2F5 would, while the sera from ES5 immunized animals did not.

Here we developed MultiGraft Interface, a new computational protocol that expands MultiGraft, our previously described algorithm for binding motif transplantation. In the first stage of MultiGraft Interface, a particular conformation of a binding motif is transplanted and stabilized on a candidate scaffold identified from all the existing structures in the Protein Data Bank. Subsequently, de novo contacts are engineered between the scaffold and a user-defined area of the binding partner outside the grafted interface. MultiGraft Interface is general and can be applied outside antigen development, for example to design novel protein inhibitors or biosensors by engineering novel binding partners for a given target or by altering the specificity and affinity of existing binding interactions. As evidenced by the successful design of 1dwu_CM, MultiGraft Interface is capable of significant structural and sequence modifications. In 1dwu_CM, the 2F5 epitope loop replaced an \u03b1-helix in the native protein, resulting in one residue deletion and the structural modification of a 17-residue segment. The resulting RMSD between the design model and the native crystal structure in the epitope region was 3.7 \u00c5, with an RMSD of 6 \u00c5 between the core 664 DKW 666 epitope segment and the corresponding native structure.

For example, candidate scaffolds required extensive structural changes to accommodate the two-loop epitope of HIV bnAb b12, and as a result only one out of 62 experimentally characterized pure computational designs bound b12, and in that case the affinity was 10000-times worse than the native antibody-antigen interaction 6 . In contrast, over twenty 2F5 and 4E10 epitope-scaffolds engineered by side-chain grafting, which aims to change the sequence of the scaffold without altering backbone conformation, were produced as stable proteins and showed binding levels comparable to the native antibody epitope 5, 8 . These results underscore the difficulty of correctly predicting and designing protein backbone conformation as opposed to making more conservative changes to the sequence of a given protein that are not intended to alter backbone structure 34 .

To reduce this complexity, MultiGraft Interface implements an anchored interface design 36 approach to build binding interactions. Given a functional motif and a suitable scaffold, our protocol first \"anchors\" the motif (i.e. the 2F5 epitope) on the scaffold and thus defines a rigid body orientation for the binding partners. Additional contacts can then be engineered to target a region (i.e. the antibody CDR H3 loop) outside the native interface (i.e. the antibody paratope). All the designed interactions between the epitopescaffolds and the CDR H3 loop in this study were hydrophobic. While this is partly due to the nature of the CDR H3, other interface design studies that used Rosetta similarly produced largely non-polar protein-protein interfaces 37 . In contrast, natural protein-protein interfaces rely both on hydrophobic interactions and on intricate hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions to modulate binding affinity and specificity.

            "text": "In our preliminary animal study, 1dwu_CM elicited sera that cross-reacted with gp41 but did not neutralize HIV. While multiple factor likely contribute to the lack of neutralization, it is possible that 1dwu_CM elicits antibodies that cannot access the HIV gp41 due to steric clashes with the membrane lipid in the native gp41 environment, given that the modeling, experimental validation and immunizations where done without lipid present. Another possibility may be that the CDR H3 loops of the elicited antibodies, while binding strongly to 1dwu_CM, do not interact with the virus the same way that the CDR H3 loop of 2F5 does, an interaction that has not been yet been elucidated in molecular detail. Additional immunogenicity studies will better characterize the specificity of the sera and in particular should attempt to evaluate whether 1dwu_CM can induce antibodies that both bind to the 2F5 peptide epitope and possess CDR H3 loops that contact the 2F5-CDR H3complementarity patch engineered onto the scaffold. Future studies will assess the potential of 1dwu_CM to elicit 2F5-like antibodies either on its own or in combination with other epitope-scaffolds or MPER peptide derivatives. It may be important to test 1dwu_CM in non-human primates that produce antibodies with a CDR H3 length distribution similar to humans. Notably, for RSV, the epitope-scaffolds that elicited neutralizing antibodies did so only when tested in macaques, but not in mice 7 . 1dwu_CM may also prove useful as a probe to screen for novel 2F5-like antibodies with long hydrophobic CDR H3 loops from the sera of HIV infected patients. If such antibodies could be isolated, they may serve to improve our understanding of responses to the 2F5 epitope during natural infection, and they may serve as templates for further vaccine development.",

In separate experiments for the two epitope-scaffolds, equal amounts of antibodies were captured on different flow cells of the same chip. 1dwu_CM was injected at 500nm, 167.8nM, 18.9nM, 6.3nM and 2.1nM. 1dwu_CM_K95A was injected at 10\u00b5M, 2\u00b5M, 400nM, 80nM, 16nM, 3.2nM and 0.64nM. The different ranges in the overall response units (y-axis) are due to the different amounts of the epitopescaffolds bound to the chip surface according to the binding affinities of the constructs. 1dwu_CM interacts with the CDR H3 loop of 2F5.
