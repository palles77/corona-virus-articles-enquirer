BALB/c mice were immunized with this recombinant strain through different routes: intranasally, orogastrically, intraperitoneally, and intravenously. Results showed that the intranasal route caused the highest production of specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgG2a, and secretory IgA, where IgG2a was imprinted as a Th1 cell bias.",

N protein of SARS-CoV is a 46-kDa conserved protein that participates in the replication and transcription of the virus and interferes with the cell cycle of host cells (36) . Amino acid sequence homology between SARS-CoV and other CoVs is low, and this is a possible cause for the difference in pathogenesis (25) . It was reported that more than 94% of SARS patients were positive for N protein-specific antibodies that appeared at early stages of infection (41) .",

In addition, the surface-displayed SARS-CoV spike protein on Lactobacillus casei has been reported to induce neutralizing antibodies in mice (22, 23) . Studies of animal CoV vaccines have demonstrated that both systemic and cell-mediated immune responses are important in preventing the viral infections (17) . DNA vaccines targeting the N protein of SARS-CoV generated strong N-specific humoral and cellular immunity and reduced the titers of challenging vaccinia virus expressing the N protein of the SARS virus (20) . SARS-CoV N protein and S protein could induce a long persistence of memory T-cell response in humans (31, 42) .

The type IVB pil operon in S. enterica serovar Typhi contains 11 genes, pilLMNOPQRSTUV, of which pilS encodes the main structural protein and pilV codes for pilus-tip adhesion of the type IVB pili. These genes form a transcriptional unit under the control of one pil promoter, as evidenced by the absence of independent promoter. In this study, we sought to obtain an effective Salmonella-based viral vaccine candidate with both mucosal and systemic immunities. We constructed an S. enterica serovar Typhi pilS::Km r pilV::N \u03e9 mutant strain by integrating the N gene with the pilV gene under the control of pil operon promoter as the first step towards constructing a live oral Salmonella-SARS-CoV vaccine and analyzed its specific immune responses in mice with different immunization routes.",

The most important approach used in the construction of recombinant vaccine is homologous recombination.

The N gene (1.2 kb) of SARS-CoV was obtained by digestion of pCMV-Tag2B-N with BamHI and EcoRI and then inserted into the vector pUST110 digested with BglII and EcoRI to create a recombinant plasmid, pUST110-N.

Serum IgG responses against N protein were determined in the BALB/c mice immunized with the S. enterica serovar Typhi pilS::Km r pilV::N \u03e9 recombinant vaccine strain through different immunization routes, including i.n., o.g., i.p., and i.v. Results from ELISA analysis showed that the i.n. immunization route caused the highest levels of anti-N protein-specific IgG and IgG2a ( Fig. 2A and B ) (i.n. versus o.g., i.p., and i.v.; P \u03fd 0.05). In addition, both i.n. and o.g. immunization routes induced the highest levels of specific S-IgA among all routes on March 19, 2020 by guest http://cvi.asm.org/ (Fig. 2C) . The parental strain (with no insert) and nonimmunized mice (controls) did not induce a detectable antibody response. The data suggested that i.n. immunization was the best route for this recombinant vaccine. Therefore, we chose the i.n. immunization route for the rest of the experiments in this study. In mice, the presence of IgG2a antibodies is indicative of a Th1-biased response since the Th1 cytokines are necessary for this isotype shift in B cells. Our results demonstrated that immunization of mice with the S. enterica serovar Typhi pilS::Km r pilV::N \u03e9 recombinant strain could induce more of an IgG2a Th1-type response than the parental strain. In addition, the recombinant strain could elicit specific mucosal immunity. S. enterica serovar Typhi pilS::Km r pilV::N \u0609 recombinant vaccine stimulated specific CTL responses in mice. Mice were immunized with the recombinant strain or the parental bacterium strain i.n. on day 0 and 14, respectively, and then euthanized at day 28. The specific CTL activities in splenocytes from the immunized mice were examined. Splenocytes from immunized mice were restimulated with the recombinant N protein in vitro as expanded effector cells and incubated with MHCmatched CT26 (H-2 d ) cells, which stably expressed N protein as target cells. CTL assays showed that the recombinant vaccine strain elicited significantly higher levels of specific CTL responses than the S. enterica serovar Typhi pilS::Km r parental strain and the control group (Fig. 3) . We determined that the highest CTL activity was detected when the ratio of effector cells to target cells (E:T) was 2.5:1. These results demonstrated IFN-\u2425 secretion is indicative of a Th1-biased response, while IL-4 production is indicative of a Th2-biased response. Using the ELISPOT technique, production of IFN-\u2425 and IL-4 was detected from splenocytes in all immunized mouse groups. After stimulation by the recombinant N protein (expressed and purified from E. coli BL21), splenocytes from the recombinant strain group induced significantly higher levels of IFN-\u2425-producing cells (mean \u03ee SD, 5,270 \u03ee 244) than those from the parental strain group (mean \u03ee SD, 2,300 \u03ee 268) (P \u03fd 0.05) (Fig. 4A) . However, there were no significant differences in the levels of expression of IL-4-producing cells among all groups, including the recombinant vaccine group, parental strain group, and nonimmunized control group (Fig. 4B ).

            "text": "In this study, the reason we selected the S. enterica serovar Typhi pilS::Km r strain as the parental bacterium is that the expression of virulent antigen Vi and the expression of type IVB pili are defective (44) . The type IVB pilus of the pathogen has been identified as an important virulence factor that was required for pathogenicity (44) . Moreover, the type IVB pilus operon is confined to S. enterica serovar Typhi and a few other human-invasive strains such as Salmonella enterica serovars Paratyphi C and Dublin (26, 40) . The S. enterica serovar Typhi mutant (pilS::Km r ) strain significantly attenuated the adhesion to and invasion of human intestinal or monocytic cells compared with those of the wild-type strain (28, 44) . Of the attenuated S. enterica serovar Typhi strains (for example S. enterica serovar Typhi Ty21a), the immunogenicity of Ty21a is not remarkable, particularly when the vaccine is administered in capsule form by oral vaccination. Other highly immunogenic S. enterica serovar Typhi derivatives made and tested to date have either caused fever or may retain the potential to cause fever in at least some small numbers of volunteer recipients. So the attenuated S. enterica serovar Typhi pilS::Km r strain was ex- on March 19, 2020 by guest http://cvi.asm.org/ amined in this study for its possibility to elicit a full and strong immune response by the natural route of infection. Our results clearly showed that the type IVB pilus operon promoter controlling nucleocapsid gene expression of SARS-CoV in the S. enterica serovar Typhi pilS::Km r pilV::N \u03e9 strain could elicit a full specific immune response by i.n. vaccination. Since plasmid DNA is relatively easily lost, we constructed this attenuated S. enterica serovar Typhi vaccine stably expressing the conserved N protein of SARS-CoV by integrating the N gene into the pilV gene under the control of pil promoter in the chromosome of the strain. This expression of N protein in the vaccine strain is stable after many (more than 20) in vitro passages (data not shown). However, this attenuated S. enterica serovar Typhi strain is a Ty2 derivative, EX462, with rifampinresistant, Vi-negative, \u2424-galactosidase mutant and with a kanamycin cassette inserted to inactive pilS (44) . Therefore, this strain encodes resistance to two antibiotics, which limits the experimental and clinical studies that can be done with animals. For this reason, future work may be performed to insert other candidate antigen genes (for example, the gene coding for SARS viral spike protein) into the two antibiotic resistance genes (Rif r and Kam r ) to confer their resistance.",

For example, S. enterica serovar Typhi CVD 908 expressing the major protein gp63 of Leishmania mexicana mexicana was shown to be immunogenic through this pathway, eliciting both humoral and cellular immune responses (12) . Pickett et al. (32) reported that attenuated S. enterica serovar Typhi live-vector vaccine strains were highly immunogenic in mice following i.n. but not o.g inoculation. Despite the established utility of this murine i.n. model (1, 9) , little is known about the immunogenicity of serovar Typhi vaccine strains administered by different routes. We have demonstrated that the i.n. route of immunization caused the highest production of specific IgG, IgG2a, and S-IgA to SARS-CoV N antigens delivered by S. enterica serovar Typhi live-vector vaccines compared to the o.g., i.p., and i.v. routes (Fig. 2 ). In addition, administration of 10 9 CFU of bacteria by the i.v. or i.p. route could cause death of mice (data not shown), while 10 7 CFU of bacteria i.v. or i.p. did not induce enough of an immunogenic response (Fig. 2) ; therefore, we considered the i.n. route to be the best, although the dose of the i.n. and o.g. application was 100-fold higher than that for the i.p. and i.v., which might have some effects on magnitude of response. More safety concerns about the i.n. route for live bacterial vector strains in humans might be considered for further investigation. Cell-mediated immune response is a crucial mechanism of defense against most intracellular pathogens and tumors (14, 19) , although it remains elusive for the new, emerging SARS-CoV. Our data showed that the recombinant strain could inhibit the N-expressing tumor growing in vivo (Fig. 5 ) by stimulating specific cellular immune responses. We also observed that the attenuated S. enterica serovar Typhi pilS::Km r pilV::N \u03e9 vaccine elicited strong specific CTL responses (Fig. 3 ) as measured by LDH release assay at an E:T ratio of 2.5/1. There was no significant increase of CTL responses at the E:T ratios of 5/1 and 10/1 (data not shown), and the reasons for these are not known. We speculate that one of the reasons might be due to minimal activity detected following in vitro expansion of memory cells. Another possibility is that CTL activities are not measured by direct MHC-I perforin-mediated lysis experiments.",

Our newly constructed attenuated S. enterica serovar Typhi pilS::Km r pilV::N \u03e9 vaccine proved to be a highly proficient live-vaccine candidate. Our work also provides insights into how the integration of other foreign genes into the genes under the control of the type IVB pilus promoter in the attenuated S. enterica serovar Typhi live vector might be attractive for vaccine delivery and vaccine candidate development against intracellular microorganism infection, respiratory infection, or inhibition of tumor growth. This is due to its ability to stably express foreign antigens and induce mucosal, humoral, and cellular immune responses.",
