Ebolavirus matrix protein VP40 is involved in the virus assembly and budding process. The RNA binding pocket of VP40 is considered as the drug target site for structure based drug design. High Throughput Virtual Screening and molecular docking studies were employed to find the suitable inhibitors against VP40. Ten compounds showing good glide score and glide energy as well as interaction with specific amino acid residues were short listed as drug leads. These small molecule inhibitors could be potent inhibitors for VP40 matrix protein by blocking virus assembly and budding process.

VP40 matrix protein assembles and budding process take place at the plasma membrane, which requires lipid raft micro domains [21, 22] . VP40 is active not only in the lipid bilayer during the assembly process but also plays an important role either in viral or host cell RNA metabolism during its Crystal structure of VP40 is an octamer, forms a pore-like structure and binding with RNA. The protein-RNA interface is stabilized by 140 amino acids residues of VP40 (including Thr123, Phe125 and Arg134 amino acid residues of a fragment of N-terminal domain) and UGA of RNA. The monomeric structure having two domains, N-terminal and C-terminal domains are involved in membrane association. RNA binding pocket could serve as a target for antiviral drug development [23] .",

VP40 octameric structure shows that the interfaces of the dimeric subunit are similar to the interface occupied by the N-and C-terminal domains in the closed conformation [30] . The aim of this study was to identify potential lead compounds against VP40 protein target using high throughput virtual screening and molecular docking approaches and subjecting the identified molecules for ADME analysis. Protein structure X-ray crystal structure of the matrix protein VP40 at 1.6 \u00c5 resolution was retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 1H2C) [33] . Protein preparation wizard was used in Schrodinger 2010. All the water molecules and RNA were removed from the original crystal structure before protein preparation process, to analyse the structure and the bond order assigned, hydrogen atoms were added and the geometry of all the hetero groups were corrected. Hydrogen bonds assignment tool was used to optimize the hydrogen bond network. Finally, impref optimized the position of hydrogen bonds and keeping all the atoms in place. Energy minimization was carried out using default constraint of the 0.3 \u00c5 of RMSD and the OPLS_2005 force field.",

            "text": "The Ebola virus matrix protein VP40 associates with the assembly and budding process of enveloped viruses. VP40 contains two short sequence motifs (PPXY and PTAP) at its Nterminus whose presence have been implicated in virus particle release by interacting with cellular factors [23] . Matrix protein/RNP interactions have been reported for a number of enveloped viruses [26] [27] [28] [29] . This process may generally involve interactions with viral RNA, such as corona virus M/mRNA1 recognition, which seems to be crucial for the M-NP association [39] . In addition, other studies implicated that the matrix proteins interfere with the cellular RNA metabolism [40, 41] . The dimer interface is stabilized by the interaction with ssRNA segment. The RNA mainly interacts with Arg134, Phe125 [23] . Arg134, Phe125 are the most important residues in the interaction and both are positioned next to each other and exposed close to the interface of the N-terminal domains in the monomeric conformation it might play them in the transition process. VP40 is a monomer in solution and it is containing two domains [3-(dimethylamino) propyl]-3,9-dimethyltetrahydrochloride) is reported as an inhibitor of Ebola virus replication without its specificity towards any of the potent target proteins [45, 46] . Ribavirins, which function as host and virus proteins, aryl methyldiene rhodanine derivative, termed \"LJ001,\" LJ001 intercalates into lipid bilayers, probably via the phenyl ring on its nonpolar end and positions the pharmacophore on the opposite polar end for activity. It is possible that an activation of the thioxo functionality occurs to cause damage in the lipid environment of the virus or cell. The actual efficacy of LJ001 for the prophylactic, postexposure, or therapeutic treatment of enveloped viral diseases probably will depend on formulation and pharmacological considerations as well as on the pathogenic profile of the virus [47] . SAH hydrolase inhibitor is to boost the immune response by stimulating interferon production. SAH inhibitors induced IFN\u03b1 given immediately reduce the Ebola and Zaire resulted only in a 2-day in the onset of illness and death [48] . Cyanovirin-N (CV-N) is a protein that is produced by cyanobacteria and it binds to high-mannose oligosaccharides, treatment for 6 days delayed the onset of illness and prolonged the time of survivalhowever, it failed to protect mice from death [49] .",

HTVS screened compounds from ASINEX and TCM database were subjected to SP docking which resulted in 159 compounds. These compounds were further taken for XP docking. Using XP docking, based on the glide score, glide energy and H-bond interactions with the amino acid residues of RNA binding site, 10 compounds were shortlisted. ADME properties test of the hit molecules indicated that all the 10 compounds were within the acceptable range of Lipinski's Rule of Five. This suggests that the ten compounds could be potential inhibitors of the VP40 matrix protein. Out of the ten compounds, ASN03576800 (2-[2-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylamino)-2-oxoethyl]sulfinylacetic acid) has a good glide score and glide energy (-7.46 & -50.30 kcal/mol). The ligand has a good contact with the specific amino acid residue Arg134 and other residues like Gly126 and Thr173 with the hydrogen bond distances of 2.0, 1.9 and 2.1 \u00c5. The ligand ASN03576800 could be a potent inhibitor for Ebola virus matrix protein VP40 in process of viral assembly and budding process.",
