These positive strand RNA viruses encode a replicase polyprotein that is processed into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). The nsps assemble with membranes to generate double membrane vesicles, which are the sites of viral RNA synthesis. MHV nsp3 contains multiple domains including two papain-like protease domains, PLP1 and PLP2, and a predicted transmembrane (TM) domain. In this study, we determined the membrane topology of nsp3-TM and showed that TM-mediated tethering of PLP2 is important for processing at cleavage site 3. Biochemical analysis revealed that nsp3 is an integral membrane protein that is inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes co-translationally and glycosylated at asparagine-2357. Proteinase K digestion experiments indicate that the TM domain of nsp3 has 4 membrane-spanning helices. We show that nsp3-TM is sufficient in mediating ER membrane association of a cytosolic protein. This study is the first detailed analysis of the topology and function of the coronavirus nsp3 TM domain.",

MHV is a \u223c31.5-kilobase (kb) positivestrand RNAvirus that replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The 5\u2032-most 22 kb of the MHV genomic RNA contains two large open reading frames (ORFs), termed ORF1a and ORF1b (Lee et al., 1991) . During translation of the genomic RNA, the two ORFs are joined via a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism to produce a polyprotein of \u223c800 kilodaltons (kDa) in size (Brierley et al., 1987; Lee et al., 1991) . This polyprotein is the viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase, termed the replicase. The MHV replicase is processed by three distinct proteases contained within ORF1a of the replicase polyprotein. Two of the proteases are papain-like cysteine proteases, termed PLP1 and PLP2. The third protease domain is distantly related to the picornavirus family of 3C-like proteases, and is termed 3CLpro. These three proteases process the replicase polyprotein to produce intermediates and products that function in the replication of genomic RNA and the synthesis of a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs [reviewed in (Brian and Baric, 2005; Sawicki and Sawicki, 2005) ]. Studies have shown that the replicase products alone are sufficient to mediate viral RNA synthesis , and to generate the double-membrane structures that serve as the sites for viral RNA synthesis (Pedersen et al., 1999) . However, the role of proteolytic processing in regulating the assembly and function of the MHV replication complex is not yet understood. Therefore, we wanted to identify regions of the replicase polyprotein that may direct or regulate proteolytic processing and/or membrane association. The focus of this study was to identify the regions of MHV nsp3 that direct membrane association and PLP2 activity.",

The crystal structure of this enzyme has been resolved and is currently being targeted for anti-viral drug development (Ratia et al., 2006) .

We used a trans-cleavage assay to determine if an expressed PLP2 domain was sufficient for the recognition and processing of a substrate containing CS3. We found that constructs containing PLP2 and the downstream putative TM domain were able to efficiently process the substrate. Bioinformatic analysis of the nsp3-TM domain indicated the presence of putative membrane-spanning helices and consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation. Site-directed mutagenesis of the asparagine residues and analysis of endoglycosidase H (endo H) sensitivity revealed that asparagine-2357 in nsp3-TM is glycosylated. To investigate the topology of nsp3-TM, we tested for sensitivity to digestion with proteinase K and found that at least two lumenal domains are protected, consistent with 4 membranespanning regions in nsp3-TM. We showed that nsp3-TM alone is sufficient to confer membrane association to a normally cytosolic protein, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), and that a predicted multi-spanning TM domain is conserved in nsp3 of all coronaviruses. Thus, the nsp3-TM domain is important for membrane association of the replicase and tethering the PLP2 domain for viral polyprotein processing activity.",

To determine if a similar domain is important for MHV PLP2 activity, we generated a series of PLP2 C-terminal deletion constructs and tested each construct for expression and processing activity. PLP2 expression constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and cloning of the amplified region into pcDNA3.1/V5-His, as described in Materials and methods. To determine if each clone was expressing a protein of the expected size, we analyzed the products after T7-mediated expression and immunoprecipitation (Fuerst et al., 1986; Kanjanahaluethai and Baker, 2000) . We detected the expected series of truncated PLP2 proteins that ranged in size from \u223c96 kDa to \u223c 50 kDa (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-6) . To determine if these PLP2 products were sufficient to mediate processing of CS3, we tested each construct in the trans-cleavage assay by co-transfection with the substrate (Fig. 1C, lanes 7-12) . We found that only two of the PLP2 expression products, pPLP2-2485 and pPLP2-2390, were able to efficiently process the substrate and produce the 44-kDa cleavage product, nsp4 (Fig. 1C, lanes 7 and 8). These two constructs encompass all or a major part of the predicted nsp3-TM domain indicating that membrane tethering of PLP2 is important for recognition and processing at CS3. Thus, both SARS-CoV PLpro (Harcourt et al., 2004) and MHV PLP2 require the downstream TM domain for recognition and processing at the nsp3/nsp4 junction.",

Initial bioinformatic analysis indicated two transmembrane helices in nsp3 (Ziebuhr et al., 2001) . To extend these studies of membrane association of coronavirus replicase products, we analyzed the amino acid sequence of MHV-JHM nsp3 (from glycine-833 to glycine-2840) for probability of transmembrane helices using the five different programs designed to search for putative membrane-spanning sequences: Phobius, TMHMM, HMMTOP, SOSUI and TMpred (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, each program generated a unique prediction for the topology of nsp3 (Fig. 2C ). The number of predicted membrane-spanning domains varied from three (Phobius) to seven (TMpred). However, since both the N-and C-termini of nsp3 are cleaved in the cytosol, the number of membrane-spanning helices must be either two [as previously predicted (Ziebuhr et al., 2001) ], four or six. To better understand the topology of the nsp3-TM domain, we performed membrane-association, fractionation and proteinase K protection experiments.",

The newly translated proteins were metabolically radiolabeled with [ 35 S]-translabel, subjected to centrifugation to separate the membrane-associated pelleted fraction from the soluble fraction. Protein products of both fractions were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 3) . The percentage of total proteins detected in soluble and pelleted fractions was quantitated by phosphoimaging analysis. In the absence of CMM, the translated protein products were detected predominantly in the soluble fraction (Fig. 3A) . In contrast, when CMMs were added to the mixture, protein products that included all or part of nsp3-TM (PLP2-2485, -2390 and -2258) were detected predominantly in the pelleted fraction, consistent with membrane association (Fig. 3B ). To determine if the membrane association occurred co-translationally or post-translationally, we added the CMMs after termination of translation, and assessed membrane association. Previous studies with hepatitis C virus revealed post-translational insertion of the NS5A replicase protein (Brass et al., 2002) . We found that the translation product of PLP2-2485 is inserted co-translationally, with no detectable post-translational insertion into membranes (Fig. 3C ). These results indicate that MHV nsp3 membrane insertion likely occurs via the normal, signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent ER translocation mechanism, and not via a tail-anchoring or post-translational mechanism.",

The PLP2-Cen protein was either untreated, or treated with endo H for 16 h, then analyzed for mobility by electrophoresis through a 5% polyacrylamide gel. We found that the untreated wild-type protein migrated at approximately 110 kDa (lane 1). However, after digestion with endo H, the protein migrated at 108 kDa (lane 2), consistent with the loss of one N-linked modification. The PLP2-Cen-N2357A protein with an asparagine-to-alanine substitution migrated more quickly than the wild type or N2281A protein, indicating that N2357 is the site modified by N-linked glycosylation (compare lanes 3-5). Furthermore, proteins generated by endo H treatment of the pPLP2-Cen-N2357A and pPLP2-Cen-N2281A migrated more quickly than wild type PLP2-Cen (lanes 6-8).

Cytosolic domains are sensitive to proteinase K, whereas transmembrane and lumenal domains are protected from digestion with proteinase K. Analysis of PLP2-2485 revealed two major fragments of 28 kDa and 10 kDa protected from proteinase K digestion (Fig.  6, lane 2) . We noted the predicted size of the TM domain from K2227-Y2469 is 28.0 kDa, and the predicted size of the K2227-I2308 (A and B helices) is 9.6 kDa. Analysis of PLP2-2390 revealed two protected fragments of 19 kDa and 10 kDa, respectively (Fig. 6, lane 4) . The predicted size of the K2227-S2390 fragment is 18.8 kDa. By combining the results of the integral membrane assays (Figs. 3 and 4) , the glycosylation assay (Fig. 5) , and the proteinase K sensitivity assay (Fig. 6A ), we were able to generate a topology model for nsp3-TM that is consistent with all the data (Figs. 6B and C). Our results indicate that nsp3-TM has four membrane-spanning sequences and two lumenal domains (Fig. 6B ) and that the 10 kDa fragment likely represents the proteinase K resistant fragment generated by the first two membrane-spanning sequences. Our model is most similar to the predicted models generated by the TMHMM and SOSUI programs with the exception that the fourth predicted membrane-spanning sequence (which is the only domain not consistent in these two predictions) is not a membrane-spanning sequence, but instead remains lumenal, and the final membranespanning domain is in the reverse orientation. Our results, and the results of others (Hugle et al., 2001; Miller et al., 2006) , demonstrate the importance of experimental validation of bioinformatics predictions of membrane-spanning sequences. For example, in the case of Dengue virus type 2 nonstructural protein 4B, Miller and co-workers found that two computerpredicted transmembrane helices were in fact lumenal and one was glycosylated (Miller et al., 2006) . In addition, we note the value of using multiple programs to better estimate the complexity of the bioinformatic prediction. The differences in the predicted models could then be tested experimentally. Here, we provide an initial model of nsp3-TM that should be refined by further experimentation. Similar studies should also be performed to determine the topology of nsp4 and nsp6, the other coronavirus replicase products with multiple predicted transmembrane helices.",

EGFP normally is distributed throughout the cell (Fig. 7A) . We found that appending the MHV nsp3-TM sequence to EGFP Fig. 4 . Membrane extraction experiments of the PLP2 expressed protein products treated with Triton X-100, urea, NaCl or sodium carbonate solution pH 11.5. In vitro transcription and translation reactions of pPLP2-2485, pPLP2-2390 or pPLP2-2258 were performed in the presence of CMM. Subsequently, reaction mixtures were centrifuged to sediment CMM containing associated PLP2 protein. The supernatant were removed and the pellets were resuspended in NTE buffer or 0.5% Triton X-100 (A), 4 M urea, 1 M NaCl or 100 mM sodium carbonate solution pH 11.5 (B) and incubated for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. Subsequently, membrane sedimentation analyses were performed as described under Materials and methods. Soluble (S) and pellet (P) fractions were applied in equivalent amounts and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE analysis. Quantitation was performed by phosphoimaging and values expressed in % were given at the bottom and depicted as bars. was sufficient to tether it to membranes, as shown by the intense, perinuclear localized signal (Fig. 7B ). To determine if the nsp3-TM domain is retained in the ER membranes or is transported through the medial Golgi, we radiolabeled the EFGP-nsp3TM protein in transfected cells, immunoprecipitated the protein and subjected the immunoprecipitated products to endo H. We found that EFGP-nsp3TM is sensitive to treatment with endo H, indicating that the protein is retained in the ER and does not pass through the medial Golgi. Thus, the nsp3-TM domain is sufficient to confer membrane-localization and retention in the ER. These studies are in agreement with our previous findings showing that the TM domain of SARS-CoV nsp3 (previously termed the HD) confers membrane association of EGFP (Harcourt et al., 2004) .",

Furthermore, we found the region nsp3-TM domain is required for efficient MHV PLP2 process activity at cleavage site 3 in the polyprotein. Why does MHV PLP2 require membrane association for proteolytic processing of the PLP2 cleavage site? One possible explanation is that membrane-tethering brings PLP2 into close proximity with a membrane-associated substrate. It is also possible that the nsp3-TM membrane tether is important for anchoring the replicase complex to intracellular membranes. Bioinformatic analysis of the nsp3 of 10 other coronaviruses revealed that the membrane-spanning features of nsp3-TM are conserved in all viruses (Fig. 8 , analysis using the TMHMM program is shown as an example), even though the amino acid identity is relatively low (18-32% identity within nsp3). Therefore, the TM domain is likely to be important for both PLP2 activity and assembly of the replication complex. Further studies will be required to determine the precise topology of the TM domain in other coronaviruses, and if the lumenal sequences in nsp3-TM play any role in interacting with host factors during viral replication.",
