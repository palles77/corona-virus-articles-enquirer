There are also differences between the immune responses raised against antigens injected in the skin and blood stream (Cremer et al., 1983) . Other authors (Abranches et al., 1991; Oliveira et al., 1993) used amastigotes, which are antigenically distinct from promastigotes, the naturally infective form of the parasite for mammals (Zhang and Matlashewski, 1997) .

After infection some dogs remain asymptomatic, but many develop a progressive disease with lymphoadenopathies, dermatitis, weigh loss, anemia and locomotion problems. The ideal model of canine leishmaniasis to be used in vaccine and immunotherapy studies would reproduce the immunological aspects of natural infection and disease, including the characteristics of an immune response generated to antigens injected in the dermis. It would, therefore, use the skin as the route of infection and low number of metacyclic promastigotes (Warburg and Schlein, 1986) . In order to be cost-effective, the model should induce disease in a short observation period (2-4 months would be a reasonably short pre-patent period for laboratory work with dogs, a period also observed in natural infection; Moreno and Alvar, 2002) . The model should also induce disease in all the animals, allowing for small groups to be used, fulfilling the ethical and economical requirements of reducing the number of animals used in experiments. Experiments performed using skin as a route of parasite inoculation in dogs, however, lead to the appearance of signs of infection only after a long period of follow-up, and in most of the animals disease is never evident (Paranhos et al., 1993; Killick-Kendrick et al., 1994) . Titus and Ribeiro (1988) proposed that Lutzomyia longipalpis saliva enhances tegumentar infection with Leishmania major in mice. Since then, this observation has been confirmed by using different strains of mice and species of Leishmania that cause cutaneous lesions (Theodos et al., 1991; Lima and Titus, 1996) and L. chagasi-infected hamsters (Warburg et al., 1994) . In a previous study, we used lysate of salivary glands from L. longipalpis in an attempt to enhance L. chagasi infection in mongrel dogs (Paranhos et al., 1993) . No clinical, parasitological or serological signs of infection were observed in any of the nine dogs inoculated intradermally with L. chagasi, with the exception of a dog that received Leishmania in saline. Killick-Kendrick et al. (1994) infected Beagle dogs with L. infantum associated with Phlebotomus perniciosus salivary gland lysate (SGL). Their study, however, did not investigate a possible enhancing effect of sand fly saliva, since the same animals were subjected to injections of parasites with and without SGLs. The authors were unable to observe macroscopic or histological differences in sites of dermal infection with L. infantum in the presence or absence of SGL.

In order to do that, the possible effect of L. longipalpis SGL on the enhancement of intra-cutaneous experimental L. chagasi infection in Beagle dogs was investigated. We chose to work on Beagle dogs because of a possible high resistance of mongrel dogs to Leishmania infection , which were used in our previous study with L. longipalpis salivary glands (Paranhos et al., 1993) . Our hypothesis was that sand fly SGL would enhance the infection of dogs with L. chagasi, leading to an early viceralization and to the progression of infection to symptomatic disease. The course of intradermal L. chagasi infection in the presence or absence of L. longipalpis saliva was therefore followed up in Beagle dogs. As a reference we infected a group of animals according to a classical model, injecting large number of parasite by the intravenous route. In our (Paranhos et al., 1993) and in other groups' experience this intravenous inoculation of Leishmania leads to parasite dissemination to internal organs and positive serological tests for anti-Leishmania antibodies.",

The optimal concentration of Con-A and time of stimulation used in this study was established in preliminary experiments. Cell proliferation was quantified by measuring the incorporation of 3 H thymidine (Amersham). Twelve hours before harvesting 1 Ci was added per well. Cells were harvested on fiber filters utilizing a cell harvester (both from Skatron). The radioactive uptake was determined in a liquid scintillation beta counter. The intensity of the proliferative response was expressed by the stimulation index, calculated by dividing the mean of counts obtained in Con-A containing wells, by the mean counts of control wells. Stimulation indices equal or higher than 3 were considered to be indicative of proliferation. This threshold for positive lymphoproliferative response was based on data from a previous experiment performed in our laboratory using 38 animals. In this study, the mean value of the proliferative response of cells in presence of medium alone plus three standard deviation of the mean (encompassing 99.85% of the values) corresponded to a stimulation index lower than 3 (dos-Santos et al., unpublished).",

Even with complete medical support provided, excluding the use of anti-Leishmania drugs, the animals in the former group developed anemia and persistently high serum levels of anti-Leishmania antibodies and spleen parasitism.

In our experiment, however, PCR was capable of detecting Leishmania DNA even in samples that were negative for parasites in culture. Even so, some intradermally infected animals had negative PCR results in some tests. One of the possible reasons for the variable detection of Leishmania in spleen aspirates of the intradermally infected animals, both in PCR and culture, could be a non-continuous (multifocal) distribution of parasites in the tissue, usually present in animals with low parasite burden. Although a control of DNA integrity, through the amplification of constitutive canine genes, was not performed in the small samples obtained by spleen puncture, the fact that the material from all the animal groups were handled strictly under the same conditions makes unlikely that the inter-group differences in PCR result from poor DNA preservation.",

On the other hand, the intradermal injections of 10 8 or more promastigotes only produced mild signs of disease in one out of the five infected animals in a recent study (Santos-Gomes et al., 2001) . Tolerance induced by intravenous release of antigen (Cremer et al., 1983) , provided it happened in the intravenous model of CVL, could theoretically increase the infectivity of Leishmania injected by this route. Tolerance induced against Leishmania antigens would, however, limit the use of the intravenous model of infection, particularly in those experiments designed to assess the efficacy of vaccine candidates. It is possible that under such tolerogenic conditions, the efficacy of some vaccine candidates could be underestimated. In intradermal models of infection, both killed and live parasites are promptly phagocyted by macrophages and Langerhans cells, and a presumed tolerogenic effect would be less likely to occur (Schwartz, 1998) .",

The clinical course of experimental CVL may be influenced by a number of factors, including strain virulence, parasite dose, source and developmental stage of promastigotes, dog breed (Solano-Gallego et al., 2000) and other less easily controllable events (reviewed by Moreno and Alvar (2002) ). The unpredictable nature of the experimental infection may also reflect the spectrum of clinical responses seen in natural infection (Hommel et al., 1995) . In fact, little is known about the dynamics of natural Leishmania infection in dogs. Low number of parasites are injected intradermally during one or, probably, repeated inoculations. Nutritional status and concomitant diseases may affect the course of infection in different animals. Under such variable conditions, a pre-patent period of about 110 days until the appearance of positive serology against Leishmania has been estimated (Quinnel et al., 1997) . Some naturally infected animals may never seroconvert, even after 20 months of infection (Hommel et al., 1995) , and only half serologically positive animals may develop clinical signs of disease (Hommel et al., 1995) . Hence, the single exposure to the parasite, and the selection, in the experimental model of healthy dogs, which may be able to mount an effective cellular immune response, may additionally reduce the success of the intradermal models for CVL.",

The addition of L. longipalpis SGL to the infective inoculum did not change the course of L. chagasi infection; it did not lead to early amastigotes detection in the spleen or to an increase in parasite burden in the organ. Therefore, it had no advantage in terms of producing an experimental model for CVL. In order to exclude the possibility that a putative previous contact with sand flies might have immunized the animals against salivary gland components, and thus interfered with a possible infection-enhancing effect of saliva (Belkaid et al., 1998) , animal sera were tested, before infection, for the presence of anti-L. longipalpis salivary gland antibodies. The lack of enhancing effect of the SGL cannot be explained by anti-saliva antibody activity, since the animals were negative for that activity before the cutaneous injection of SGL. In effect, our results are in agreement with the observations that L. longipalpis SGLs with high vasodilation activity did not enhance experimental L. chagasi infection in mongrel dogs (Paranhos et al., 1993) and may vary in their ability to enhance infection in murine models of tegumentar leishmaniasis (Castro-Sousa et al., 2001; Warburg et al., 1994) .",

Even in this group, increase in antibody levels only occurred after the fifth month of infection, at least 3 months after parasites had been detected in the spleen. These findings are consistent with observations in naturally infected animals; in serological surveys for canine leishmaniasis in endemic areas, about 20% of animals had parasites in the spleen and low or undetectable anti-Leishmania antibodies by ELISA (Ashford et al., 1995) . Such population of infected dogs with negative serology may be constituted by animals which (1) are asymptomatic, with the infection under control and, therefore, with low parasite burden, as described herein for animals infected intradermally or (2) undergo disease progression, with high parasite burdens, but still with low antibody response. This last course of infection could suggest a deficiency of both Th1 and Th2 responses, whereas the more commonly observed situation, namely high intensity of tissue parasitism, disease progression and high levels of specific antibody, would occur in animals in which a Th2-biased immune response to Leishmania had evolved Cabral et al., 1998) .",

Such observations were not confirmed in our study. Peripheral mononuclear cells, even from those animals intravenously infected with L. chagasi, with relatively persistent parasite burden and positive ELISA, proliferated as well as cells from control uninfected dogs in the presence of Con-A. This data agrees with the previously reported observation (Pinelli et al., , 1995 that non-specific immunosuppression does not necessarily occur in L. chagasi/L. infantum-infected dogs. The possibility that the development of non-specific immunosuppression in CVL could depend on yet unidentified parasite-and/or host-derived factors cannot, however, be excluded.",
