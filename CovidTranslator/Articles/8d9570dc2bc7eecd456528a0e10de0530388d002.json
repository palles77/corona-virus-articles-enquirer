            "text": "Because of their large surface area and immunological competence, mucosal tissues are attractive administration and target sites for vaccination. An important characteristic of mucosal vaccination is its ability to elicit local immune responses, which act against infection at the site of pathogen entry. However, mucosal surfaces are endowed with potent and sophisticated tolerance mechanisms to prevent the immune system from overreacting to the many environmental antigens. Hence, mucosal vaccination may suppress the immune system instead of induce a protective immune response. Therefore, mucosal adjuvants and/or special antigen delivery systems as well as appropriate dosage forms are required in order to develop potent mucosal vaccines. Whereas oral, nasal and pulmonary vaccine delivery strategies have been described extensively, the sublingual and buccal routes have received considerably less attention. In this review, the characteristics of and approaches for sublingual and buccal vaccine delivery are described and compared with other mucosal vaccine delivery sites. We discuss recent progress and highlight promising developments in the search for vaccine formulations, including adjuvants and suitable dosage forms, which are likely critical for designing a successful sublingual or buccal vaccine. Finally, we outline the challenges, hurdles to overcome and formulation issues relevant for sublingual or buccal vaccine delivery.",

Vaccination saves millions of lives every year, while bringing numerous social and economic benefits [1] . Since the vast majority of pathogens infect their host through the mucosa, an ideal vaccine should induce protective immunity at mucosal sites in order to act as a first line of defense against infections. However, most of the vaccines currently in use are administered via injection, e.g., via the subcutaneous or intramuscular route. This generally induces poor mucosal immunity, whereas vaccines administered via mucosal routes have proven to be effective for the induction of both systemic and local immunity [2] . Additionally, mucosal immunization makes vaccine delivery easier and safer than parenteral administration routes, is very suitable for mass immunization during pandemic situations, and improves acceptability especially among children [3, 4] .",

            "text": "Despite the advantages mentioned above, there are currently only few mucosal vaccines for human use on the market [5] . The reason for this is that mucosal vaccination poses several challenges, such as immune regulation and tolerance, as well as overcoming fast removal of the vaccine by body fluids and enzymes, as has been reviewed for the oral [3, 6] , the nasal [7] and the pulmonary route [8] . Compared to the above-mentioned traditional mucosal routes, sublingual and buccal vaccine administration has received less attention. For many years, these routes have been used for the delivery of low-molecular-weight drugs to the bloodstream. Currently, the only vaccines that are widely being used for delivery via the oral mucosae are therapeutic sublingual allergy vaccines. These vaccines are used for sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) to treat allergic hypersensitivity. Sublingual delivery of allergens can activate regulatory T cells that can suppress undesired immune reactions [9] . This has resulted in several approved sublingual products for allergy immunotherapy, such as SLITone\u00ae, Sublivac\u00ae, Grazax\u00ae, Oralair\u00ae, and AllerSlit\u00aeforte. Allergy vaccines are reviewed by Valenta et al. [10] and are beyond the scope of this review since they are aimed at immune regulation (tolerance) instead of activation of the adaptive immune system.",

The epithelium is supported by a basement membrane, which separates the two major layers of the oral mucosa: the epithelium and the underlying connective tissue or lamina propria. The arrangement of the hard palate and gingival, including the pluristratified keratinized mucosal epithelium and the lamina propria that is anchored onto the periostium of the underlying bone, makes these regions chemically and mechanically resistant to withstand the shearing forces associated with chewing food. The floor of the mouth, the inner surface of the lips and cheeks, and the ventral side of the tongue are covered by a non-keratinized epithelium, rendering these relatively more elastic and pervious than keratinized mucosae, and thus potentially more suitable for drug or antigen delivery.",

The compacted, flattened cells of the lower superficial and intermediate layers form the major physical barrier to transport, whereas the intercellular lipids play an important role in the permeability of the mucosa. Besides the epithelial cells, the oral mucosal epithelium also contains three other cell types. The basal layer includes Merkel cells, which are endocrine cells associated with nerve fibers that contribute to the overall barrier function of the epithelium. They have also been suggested to play a role in the regenerative processes of oral mucosa [11] . Further, the suprabasal layer contains two types of cells: melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin and are thus responsible for the color of the mucosa; and Langerhans cells (LCs), which are the most superficial antigen-presenting cells and an important target for the induction of an immune response. Other antigen-presenting cells below the mucosa are the myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) located along the lamina propria and the plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) found in the submucosal tissue (Fig. 2) .",

The dermal delivery site has been included because it contains comparable features with the buccal and sublingual sites, such as the presence of LCs as a main target for the vaccine antigen. However, dermal vaccination has the disadvantage that the impermeable thick keratinized stratum corneum acts as a physiological barrier for the diffusion of antigens to reach LCs after topical administration. As a result, dermal vaccination in general needs chemical disruption and/or microneedle penetration of this wall in order to let antigens reach the LCs to induce an immune response [13] . In contrast, sublingual and buccal mucosae suitable for vaccine delivery lack keratinized epithelium.",

These M cells take care of the transport of antigens to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT). The Peyer's patches (PP), nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) are important inductive 2 . Antigen delivery and antigen presentation following sublingual or buccal vaccination. Upon vaccine delivery, the antigen is likely to be captured by Langerhans cells (LC) within the mucosa itself and myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) along the lamina propria. Antigen-bearing DCs will migrate to draining lymph nodes where they interact with na\u00efve CD4 and CD8 T cells to support the differentiation into effector T cells (i.e., helper (Th) and cytotoxic T cells (CTL)) and thereby induction of the adaptive immune response. Compared to other routes, the sublingual and buccal routes have the potential to induce mucosal immune responses in a broad range of tissues (Table 1 ) as described in more detail in Section 2.2 ('Mucosal immune responses'). Nagai et al. (2014) recently reported the transport of sublingual antigens across sublingual ductal epithelial cells to ductal APCs in mice [14] . Since different studies failed to detect specific sampling cells (or M-like structures) in the sublingual or buccal mucosa [14, 15] , it seems most likely that antigens cross the ductal epithelium via paracellular and transcellular pathways [14] . So, probably the efficiency of vaccine delivery via these routes is directly related to the permeability of the mucosal membrane. This permeability is influenced by the thickness and the degree of keratinization of these membranes. The thickness of the human buccal mucosa has been estimated to be in the range of 500-800 \u03bcm, whereas the mucosal thickness of the sublingual region is about 100-200 \u03bcm [16] . In terms of permeability, the sublingual region is more permeable than the buccal region, which in turn is more permeable than the palatal region ( Fig. 1) . Sublingual administration can provide a rapid uptake of macromolecules and thus appears to be an attractive route for dosage forms with a short delivery period.",

The antigen uptake, process and the presentation of their epitopes to T cells by antigen-presenting cells are required to induce effective adaptive immunity. For example, the ovalbumin antigen crosses the epithelial barrier within 15 to 30 min and the uptake by sublingual DCs occurs within 30 to 60 min after sublingual administration in mice [18] . Rare pro-inflammatory cells, i.e., histamine-containing mast cells (MC) or eosinophils (Eos) (Fig. 2) , are found in oral tissues, and these cells are mainly spread in the muscular layer beneath the mucosa [18, 19] . Therefore, it is likely that most of the antigen is mainly captured by LCs and other oral DCs in the upper layers prior to reaching proinflammatory cells. The relatively high frequency of LCs and low numbers of mast cells in the buccal region [19] make the buccal mucosa an attractive site for vaccine delivery despite its thicker epithelium and lower permeability as compared to the sublingual mucosa.",

For example, Eriksson et al. reported that a substantial number of DCs leave the buccal epithelium after topical buccal immunization and migrate to draining lymph nodes where they present processed antigen to CD4 T lymphocytes [20] . Another study revealed the buccal epithelium as inductive site of efficient priming of CD8 T lymphocytes [21] . Upon activation, T and B cells that leave the site of the initial antigen presentation, enter the circulation and then disperse to selected mucosal sites, where they differentiate into memory or effector cells. The activation of CD4 T lymphocytes leads to the induction of antigen-specific helper T (Th cells) and/or regulatory T cell (Treg) mediated immune responses (Fig. 2) , whereas CD8 T cells facilitate the induction of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses (Fig. 2) . The tissue destination of these cells appears to be largely determined by site-specific integrins, supposed 'homing receptors', on their surface that will bind to mucosal tissue-specific receptors (addressins) on vascular endothelial cells [22] . Recent work of Hervouet et al. demonstrates that antigen-bearing DCs that have captured the antigen in the sublingual mucosa are encountered in distant lymph nodes and spleen following sublingual immunization of mice [23] , which suggests that sublingual DCs are capable to enter the blood circulation to seed distant lymphoid organs.",

The MALT contains T-cell zones, B-cell enriched areas containing a high frequency of sIgA-positive B cells and a subepithelial area with antigen-presenting cells to induce specific immune responses. As mentioned earlier, the oral mucosa lacks a certain immunological structure as observed in Peyer's patches of the intestine where the antigen is sampled by specialized M cells. However, different studies describe the concept of oral lymphoid foci, the equivalent of the germinal centers observed in other MALT, suggesting that the oral mucosa serves as a site for immune induction. The role of oral DCs in deciding whether to induce adaptive immunity or tolerance, and whether there exist germinal centers in oral lymphoid foci are discussed extensively by others [24, 25] . The distribution of immune cells, particularly the abundant presence of oral LCs, makes the oral mucosa an attractive site for vaccine delivery. Both sublingual and buccal immunization are able to promote mucosal immunity, as well as systemic immunity, against pathogens entering the human body at more distant sites than the mouth (mucosa), such as the respiratory tract or reproductive tract (Table 1) .",

Song et al. concluded that the observed protection was mediated by the induction of influenza virus-specific IgG in the serum and secretory IgA (sIgA) in the respiratory mucosa, which limit virus entry and replication in the respiratory tract. A single sublingual dose of A/PR/8 virus prevented lung pathology induced by influenza virus challenge and provided a broad-range cross-protection against different influenza virus subtypes. Thereby, the risk of potential passage of vaccine virus to the olfactory bulb was avoided by using the sublingual route since no viral RNA was detected in brains of sublingually vaccinated mice, in contrast to mice that received the same vaccine intranasally [26] . Similarly, sublingual administration of live-attenuated virus lacking the non-structural protein 1 (DeltaNS1) was as protective against influenza virus challenges in mice as intranasal immunization. Sublingual immunization with these DeltaNS1 viruses induced high levels of virus-specific antibodies and stimulated immune cells in mucosaassociated and systemic lymphoid organs [27] . Moreover, the vaccine was well tolerated and did not induce bodyweight loss in sublingually vaccinated mice.",

Infection by adenoviruses occurs through the airway epithelium and replication takes place in mucosal tissues of the respiratory tract. These characteristics make these vectors suitable for mucosal vaccine delivery. Sublingual immunization with rAdV encoding the conserved influenza nucleoprotein antigen [28] or the soluble globular head of hemagglutinin [29] protected mice against influenza virus infection. Furthermore, sublingual administration of rAd5 vectors encoding HIV proteins induced both significant antigen-specific humoral (serum and mucosal IgG and IgA) [30] and cellular (systemic and mucosal CTL responses) [31] immune responses. Moreover, sublingual vaccination with rAdV encoding a truncated S protein (rAdV-S), which is a major antigenic protein present on severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), induced systemic neutralizing antibodies and airway IgA antibody responses in mice. These immune responses were similar to those induced by intranasal administration. It is worth noting that intranasal delivery of rAdV redirected the virus vector to the olfactory bulb, whereas no adenoviral DNA was detected after sublingual delivery [32] . Choi et al. reported that both mice and guinea pigs were protected against a lethal Ebola challenge after a single sublingual immunization with an AdV-based vaccine expressing the Zaire glycoprotein in a manner similar to that of traditional intramuscular vaccination [33] .",

Several studies have shown that engineered Bacillus (B) subtilis is able to generate systemic and mucosal antibodies against heterologous antigens. B. subtilis delivered sublingually and expressing tetanus toxin C-fragment, evoked protective immunity in both mice [35] and piglets [36] . Batista et al. reported the use of 'gut-colonizing' B. subtilis spores as a new mucosal vaccine delivery platform consisting of two antigen expression strategies. One is active during spore formation, which leads to the display of recombinant adhesins at the spore surface that facilitates adhesion to mucosal surfaces. In addition, the recombinant spores have been shown to germinate after oral delivery resulting in intracellular expression of the antigen. Mice immunized with three doses of B. subtilis spores via the sublingual route, developed higher specific serum IgG titers when compared with the mice orally immunized with a ninefold higher dose of spores of the same strains. Although not proven in this study, the authors speculated that sublingual delivery of these spores will also result in intracellular antigen expression once they are captured by intraepithelial antigen-presenting cells and germinate [37] . The better immune response to sublingual vaccination might be ascribed to the fact that sublingual delivery has a smaller distribution volume and a less aggressive environment than gastro-intestinal delivery.",

Among these routes, the intranasal and sublingual routes provided the highest HPV16L1-specific levels of vaginal sIgA and systemic IgG responses that were comparable to those elicited via the intramuscular route [45] . Sublingual vaccination against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) with a purified G protein fragment (Gcf) without the addition of adjuvants induced strong serum IgG and mucosal IgA responses (similar to intranasal vaccination) in mice. Interestingly, these antibody responses could be elicited by Gcf without the need for an adjuvant. The study demonstrated that the chemotactic activity exhibited by Gcf was necessary to induce protective immunity. Therefore, the authors proposed that Gcf has a self-adjuvanting property [46] .",

Although sublingual priming did not induce any detectable immune responses, it strongly enhanced hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers against both the homologous as well as the heterologous vaccine after the intramuscular booster. In addition, sublingual priming induced IgA responses in the lung and nose, while intramuscular priming showed higher IgA responses in the lung, but not in the nose [40] . In a study by Song et al., a sublingual booster was given, instead of an intramuscular booster, and immune responses were analyzed more extensively. Immunization with formalin-inactivated influenza virus via the sublingual mucosa induced protective immune responses, elevated mucosal sIgA antibody levels, and enhanced virus-specific CTL responses [26] . The different procedures used for virus inactivation affect the membrane fusion properties of the virus to a certain extent, resulting in a less optimal activation of CTLs. Inactivation with formalin severely compromises fusion activity of the virus, while BPL-inactivation reveals preservation of the fusion activity [60] . However, a sublingual booster vaccination with formalin-inactivated influenza induced significant elevated virus-specific CTL responses in mice. Unfortunately, the analysis of CTL activation is lacking in the study using BPL-inactivated influenza.",

For example, a mucosal adjuvant (cholera toxin, CT) was needed to induce immune responses upon sublingual immunization with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) subunit vaccine [48] . \u00c7uburu et al. evaluated the sublingual route for vaccine delivery using ovalbumin (OVA) as a model antigen.

In general, high doses were used and even the size of the antigen seemed to be an issue for successful immunization since small proteins/antigens showed the induction of both systemic and mucosal immune responses upon sublingual administration. (continued on next page) The adjuvant effect of sublingually administered CT has been documented with a number of antigens, including influenza [43] and HIV [48] subunit vaccines, Salmonella proteins [50, 51] and Helicobacter pylori lysates [54, 55] with the latter two as undefined vaccines. LT, when co-administered sublingually with tetanus toxoid (TT) induced higher specific IgG and mucosal IgA antibody titers when compared to TT alone [57] . However, CT and LT cause severe diarrhea in humans and are involved in the clinical occurrences of cholera and enterotoxigenic E. coli enteritis, and therefore not suitable as an oral or sublingual adjuvant for human use [61] [62] [63] . Since enterotoxicity is mainly caused by the enzymatically active A-subunit, mutated enterotoxins with reduced toxicity but retained adjuvant properties, have been developed. LT(R192G), also named mLT, showed reduced toxicity in mice, but maintained its adjuvanticity to a level nearly equivalent to that of LT [64, 65] . Building on this mutant, a double mutant of LT, R192G/L211A or dmLT, showed adjuvanticity for a co-administered antigen equivalent to mLT upon oral administration (gastro-intestinal delivery) [66] . Recently, dmLT has been evaluated as an adjuvant for sublingual and buccal vaccination with a whole-cell pneumococcal vaccine that induces protection in mice [52] . In the search for an alternative adjuvant for a H. pylori lysate vaccine, dmLT was compared to CT. Earlier studies have shown that a strong mucosal adjuvant like CT was needed to induce protective immune responses against H. pylori infection. Sublingual immunization with H. pylori lysate and dmLT significantly decreased the bacterial burden after H. pylori infection compared to unimmunized mice and to the same extent as when using CT as adjuvant [55] . Moreover, cellular immune responses that are known to correlate with protection were also fully comparable when using dmLT and CT as adjuvants.",

MPLA, a TLR-4 agonist, suppressed systemic responses when administered sublingually, while the responses were enhanced after intranasal or subcutaneous immunization. CpG, a TLR-9 ligand, evoked enhanced immune responses upon sublingual and intranasal immunization whereas it did not affect the responses after subcutaneous immunization [49] . Another study revealed that sublingual immunization with an Ad5 vector expressing a TLR agonist derived from Eimeriatenella significantly activated NK cells, natural killer T (NKT) cells, B cells, and CD4 + T cells in the spleen. In addition, the number of cells expressing MHC-II increased [30] .",

In this regard, extended release films or tablets that consist of multiple layers with different functions (Fig. 3 ) may be applied. The sublingual mucosa is exposed to a high saliva flow, which might be advantageous for a better swelling and dissolution of oral tablets.

Immunization studies were performed with tablets containing 250 \u03bcg ovalbumin directly followed by sublingual administration of a 1 \u03bcg/ml CT solution (7.5 \u03bcl) as adjuvant. Immunization with a fastreleasing tablet was favorable over extended release formulations and comparable to the liquid reference (ovalbumin with CT) for the immune response. However, the production of saliva was induced by administering pilocarpine subcutaneously before administering the tablet to provide better swelling and adhesion of the tablets [73] . The authors concluded that extended release formulations for sublingual vaccination have to be investigated more in detail.

Nevertheless, the use of strong mucosal adjuvants seems to be necessary to induce protective immune responses upon sublingual vaccination using inactivated vaccines. Reported studies on screening and comparison of adjuvants for sublingual vaccination, unfortunately, are still limited. Of the adjuvants investigated thus far (CT, CTB, LT, LTB, mLT, dmLT, CpG, c-di-GMP, L18-MDP, FSL-1, Poly(I:C), MPLA, Pam3CSK4, R848, murabutide, peptidoglycans, vitamin D3, chitosan and poly-gammaglutamic acid), enterotoxins (and their mutants) and TLR-9 agonists resulted in the highest antibody responses whereas the other adjuvants did not improve immune responses upon sublingual delivery. The most used adjuvants for sublingual vaccine delivery are the enterotoxins CT and LT, which are considered too toxic for human use. However, genetically defined mutants of these toxins, which have reduced or minimal toxicity, seemed to be promising adjuvants to augment both systemic and mucosal immunity in response to sublingual administration.",

Today, research on dosage form optimization for sublingual or buccal vaccination appears marginal. The few reported studies use mouse models to evaluate sublingual vaccination in vivo. Nevertheless, the small space under the tongue of animals used for preclinical studies makes testing of sublingual solid dosage forms challenging. For example, Muragappan et al. faced the problem that sublingual tablets were not able to dissolve under the tongue of mice [40] . Moreover, two-layered extended release tablets failed to adhere to the floor of the mouth in mice, resulting in a suboptimal administration that applied the tablet upside down on the ventral side of the tongue [73] . Potential problems related to the sublingual application of slow release formulations are due to the lack of an expanse of smooth or (relatively) immobile mucosa, which make it difficult to keep the dosage form in contact with the sublingual mucosa. Other dosage forms, such as wafers, films and thermo-responsive gels, should be explored as these may likely increase the potential of sublingual vaccine delivery. Sustained dosage forms (e.g., multi-layered oral films or tablets) are probably better suited for application on the buccal mucosa, which is considerably less permeable than the sublingual mucosa. The few current studies on buccal vaccine delivery use buccal injections instead of a topical application. However, the development of the extended release formulations would make topical buccal cheek vaccination easier. Compared to the sublingual route, buccal administration in small animals, such as mice, is more complicated since the buccal compartment has a minimal anatomical barrier with the sublingual compartment. Besides the animal size, the anatomical features of the oral cavity should be taken into account, because of the specialized histological characteristics and immunological competences of the oral mucosae in humans. However, most rodents, such as mice, rats and hamsters, have buccal mucosa that contains keratinized epithelium, in contrast to non-keratinized epithelium of sublingual and cheek mucosae in human. For buccal cheek administration, other animal models such as rabbits, dogs and pigs are more appropriate since they contain nonkeratinized buccal mucosae. Moreover, the thickness of the buccal mucosa in these animal models (rabbit, 600 \u03bcm; dog and pig, 770 \u03bcm) is comparable to that of humans (500-800 \u03bcm) [78] . Current literature does not address to which extent mucoadhesive formulations increase the delivery of the antigen to oral mucosal APCs after sublingual or buccal administration, requiring proper tracking (pharmacokinetics, PK) studies in relation with immunological outcome (pharmacodynamics, PD) in adequate animal models (Table 3) .",

Unfortunately, most studies are designed for an optimal readout of systemic immune responses, making assumptions on mucosal immunity not fully conclusive. Moreover, in general, the presence of sIgA is determined in saliva, which is not the best readout for mucosal immunity, especially for rodents [80] . A more predictive method to measure mucosal immunity in mucosal tissues of rodents is the 'Perfext method', which is a direct method for quantitative assessment of in vivo antibody or cytokine production at the local level [81] .

For example, a method described by Saletti et al. allows measurements of both systemic and mucosal antibody responses to vaccines by detecting antigen-specific plasmablasts with a specific mucosal pedigree (e.g., \u03b14\u03b27, CCR10) on small amounts of whole blood [83] .
