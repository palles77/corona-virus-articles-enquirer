            "text": "The Asn-Gly-Arg (NGR) motif in both cyclic and linear form has previously been shown to specifically bind to CD13/aminopeptidase N that is selectively overexpressed in tumor vasculature and some tumor cells. However, previous versions of cyclic NGR used a liable disulfide bridge between cysteine residues that may be problematic for liposome targeting due to disulfide bond formation between adjacent peptides on the liposomal surface. In this study, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of a novel cyclic NGR containing peptide, cKNGRE, which does not contain a disulfide bridge. cKNGRE was synthesized in good yield and purity and attached to the fluorescent reporter Oregon Green (cKNGRE-OG) and lysolipid-containing temperature sensitive liposome (LTSLs). The identity of cKNGRE was verified with NMR and mass spectral techniques. In vitro fluorescence microscopy evaluation of cKNGRE-OG demonstrated binding and active uptake by CD13 + cancer cells and minimal binding to CD13 \u2212 cancer cells. The cKNGRE-OG ligand displayed 3.6-fold greater affinity for CD13 + cancer cells than a linear NGR containing peptide. Affinity for CD13 + cancer cells was similarly improved 10-fold for both the cyclic and linear NGR when presented in a multivalent fashion on the surface of an LTSL. cKNGRE-targeted LTSLs rapidly released (>75% in <4 sec) doxorubicin at 41.3\u00b0C with minimal release at 37\u00b0C. These results demonstrate the ability to synthesize a cKNGRE-targeted temperature sensitive liposome that lacks a disulfide bridge and has sufficient binding affinity for biological applications.",

The use of various tumor-associated antigens for targeted cancer therapies is well documented and includes leukocyte differentiation antigen (CD33) for acute myeloid leukemia [3] , GD2 for neuroblastoma [4, 5] , and the folate receptor for a wide variety of human tumors [6] [7] [8] . Antigens expressed on angiogenic tumor vasculature are particularly attractive tumorassociated targets because they have intimate contact with the blood and are therefore geographically accessible immediately following intravenous injection of a targeted agent [9] . Widely used tumor vascular targets include integrins [10, 11] , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) [12, 13] , platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) [14, 15] , and CD13/aminopeptidase N (APN, referred to as CD13 throughout) [2, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .

Although linear NGR peptides have demonstrated suitable biodistribution and efficacy [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] , the antitumor activity of drug associated with a cyclic form of NGR was reported to be 10-fold greater [22] .

A linear NGR control peptide was synthesized for comparison. Our goal is to synthesize targeted lysolipid-containing temperature sensitive liposomes (LTSLs) for image-guided, heat-activated delivery of chemotherapeutics to solid tumors. LTSLs mainly composed of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DPPC; T m = 41.5 \u00b0C) [30] rapidly release their contents at clinically relevant hyperthermic temperatures (40-42 \u00b0C) [31] when a small fraction (~10 %) of lysolipid (e.g. 1-stearoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [MSPC]) is incorporated into the lipid bilayer [32] . LTSLs may be combined with focal hyperthermia or thermal ablation to selectively deliver encapsulated drugs to a heated region [33, 34] . To this end, we have synthesized an NGR-targeted LTSL and evaluated the binding of the targeted LTSL to CD13 + cells as well as release of encapsulated Doxorubicin (Dox) as a function of temperature. NGR-targeted LTSLs have the potential to improve therapeutic efficacy by: 1) slowing the transit time of liposomes in the tumor vasculature to improve drug release, 2) improving total drug accumulation in the tumor, and 3) treating metastatic tumors not subjected to hyperthermia.",

The free amines of the Lys residues of 3 and 4 were used to introduce the fluorescent label OG (1.1 equiv) to obtain compounds 5a and 5b, respectively (Scheme 3). Compounds 5a and 5b were purified with preparative reverse phase HPLC using a C18 column to give a yellow powder in 72 and 67.5% yield, respectively.",

Approximately 94% of the HT-1080 cells were positive for the WM15 antibody, indicating the presence of CD13. As shown in Figure 6A , cKNGRE-OG demonstrated 3.6-fold greater affinity for HT-1080 cells (EC 50 = 61.0\u00b5M) than did the linear KNGRG-OG (EC 50 = 219.9\u00b5M). Similarly, as shown in Figure 6B , LTSLs conjugated to cKNGRE (EC 50 = 6.2\u00b5M) had a 3.5-fold greater avidity than did LTSLs conjugated to linear KNGRG (EC 50 = 21.5\u00b5M). These experiments were repeated twice with similar results. These data demonstrated that the cyclic NGR had much greater affinity than the linear NGR peptide and their binding constants are sufficient for biological applications. Furthermore, the multivalent presentation of NGR peptides on the surface of liposomes increased the affinity ~10-fold over free peptides based on the concentration of NGR. Assuming a 100nm liposome, there would be ~2100 NGR ligands on the outer surface of the NGR-LTSL [41, 42] . This corresponds to ~4,200 total NGR ligands per liposome. Since there are many NGRs per liposome, the affinity based on a particle basis actually increased 41,000-fold (61\u00b5M for cKNGRE /1.5nM for cKNGRE-targeted LTSL) due to the multivalent presentation of cNGR [43] .",

This increase in affinity due to cyclization [22] is similar to other peptides that exhibit improved affinity when conformationally constrained [44] [45] [46] . The NGR-LTSL had greater avidity than the free NGR-OG as would be expected due to the multivalent presentation of the NGR ligand on the surface of the liposome [43] . In the cyclized peptide design, we employed the C \u03c9 -carboxylic acid of Glu in the ring closure process with the \u03b1-amine of Lys so as to obtain the same number of chemical bonds in the ring as that of the originally identified and most common cyclic CNGRC peptide [2, 22] , which is cyclized through a disulfide bridge.

On the surface of a liposome or other targeting vehicle, cyclic NGR peptides formed through disulfide bridges may develop additional disulfide bridges between adjacent peptides that render the ligand ineffective [29] . The new cyclized version of NGR reported herein avoided this potential pitfall while retaining sufficient binding avidity (EC 50 = 6.2 \u00b5M) to target CD13 in vitro. In contrast to the method of attaching linear NGR peptides to liposomes reported by Pastorino et al [28] that involved chemical attachment of the peptide to the pre-synthesized liposome, we first synthesized the PEG-lipid with the cyclic NGR targeting moiety and then synthesized the liposome. Although the previously reported method had the advantages of simplicity and an overall faster synthesis, our method offers more favorable control over liposome composition, reduced manipulations after drug loading, and reproducibility. To our knowledge, this may be the first report of a tumor vascular targeted LTSL, but tumor targeted temperature sensitive liposomes have been reported [50] . This targeted liposome may also be combined with emerging heat sources, such as high intensity focused ultrasound [51] , or imaging technologies for monitoring drug delivery [52] [53] [54] .",

            "text": "The combination of tumor vascular targeting and temperature triggered drug release from liposomes has the potential to improve therapeutic efficacy by: 1) slowing the transit time of liposomes in the tumor vasculature to improve drug release, 2) improving total drug accumulation in the tumor, and 3) treating metastatic tumors not subjected to hyperthermia. The targeting of tumor vasculature with liposomes has the advantage over traditional tumor cell targeted immunoliposomes [55] of not requiring the slow process of extravasation and subsequent penetration before binding and cellular uptake can occur. In contrast to tumor cell antigens, tumor vascular antigens are immediately available for binding directly after intravenous administration. Furthermore, targeting angiogenic tumor vasculature is a more ubiquitous approach applicable to most solid tumors and does not require the overexpression of a tumor cell specific antigen that is often limited to a particular subtype of tumors such as HER2 [56] . Temperature triggered drug release from LTSLs has demonstrated excellent tumor control in preclinical models [33, 51] but this local-regional therapy is limited in its ability to treat widespread metastatic disease. The promising preclinical results of NGR-targeted nonthermally sensitive liposomes in metastatic models [28] suggests that the NGR-targeted thermally sensitive formulation reported herein may be able to provide excellent local-regional control with tumor targeted hyperthermia as well as improved therapy through NGR-targeting of unheated metastatic disease.",

In vitro fluorescence microscopy studies revealed binding of cKNGRE-OG to CD13 + HT-1080 cells and minimal binding to CD13 \u2212 MCF7 cells. The membrane localization of cKNGRE-OG was similar to that of the anti-CD13 WM15 antibody with the exception of a bright punctuate signal associated with active internalization of cKNGRE-OG. The cKNGRE ligand displayed 3.6-fold greater affinity for CD13 + cancer cells than did linear KNGRG. This affinity was similarly improved 10-fold for both the cyclic and linear NGR peptides when attached to the surface of an LTSL. cKNGREtargeted LTSLs rapidly released (>75% in <4 sec) doxorubicin at 41.3 \u00b0C with minimal release at 37 \u00b0C. The results of this study are significant because they demonstrate improved avidity of an NGR-targeted LTSL without the limitation of a disulfide bridge. Fluorescence microscopy to evaluate in vitro binding of anti-CD13 antibody WM15 (top row: A, B, and C) and cKNGRE-OG (bottom row: D, E, and F) to CD13 + HT-1080 cells (B, C, E, and F) and CD13 \u2212 MCF7 cells (A and D). Green, signal from cKNGRE-OG or WM15 antibody. Blue, signal from the nuclear staining agent DAPI. Images AB and DE were acquired with identical exposure times and displayed consistently to compare binding between MCF7 and HT-1080 cells. Bar equals 100 \u00b5m for A, B, D, and E and 50 \u00b5m for C and F Epifluorescence microscopy to evaluate in vitro internalization of cKNGRE-OG by HT-1080 cells at 4 \u00b0C (A) or 37 \u00b0C (B). Green signal from cKNGRE-OG and Blue signal from the nuclear staining agent DAPI. Images were acquired with identical exposure times and displayed consistent window and level. Bar equals 100 \u00b5m.

Liposome preparationNGR-targeted liposomes-Fluorescently labeled NGR-targeted liposomes were prepared as follows. DPPC: MSPC: DSPE-PEG 2000 -NGR: DiO in molar percent ratio of 85.2: 9.7: 5: 0.1 were dissolved in chloroform, mixed, dried by solvent evaporation, and left overnight in a vacuum desiccator. The dried film was hydrated with 2.5 mL of HEPES buffer (pH 7.4, 10 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 280 mOsm) at 55 \u00b0C for 1 h to yield a final lipid concentration of 10 mg/mL. The resulting multilamellar liposomes were sized by extrusion (10X) with a LIPEX\u2122 Extruder (Northern Lipids Inc., Canada) at 55 \u00b0C through two stacked Nuclepore\u00ae polycarbonate membrane filters (Whatman plc, United Kingdom) with a pore size of 100 nm. The particle size of the liposome was determined by dynamic light scattering (ZetaPALS, Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, NY) and reported as the mean diameter \u00b1 standard deviation. DiO was included to monitor the liposome by this fluorescent label with flow cytometry.",
