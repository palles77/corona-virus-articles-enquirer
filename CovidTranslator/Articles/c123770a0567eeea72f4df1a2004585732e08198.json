Virus infections that are acute and highly aggressive in humans can be persistent and avirulent in bats (Calisher et al., 2006) . An important contributor of virus tolerance by bats is thought to be the antiviral type I interferon (IFN-a/b) system (Dobson, 2005) . Indeed, in some bats the IFN system has peculiar features and is under strong positive selection (De La Cruz-Rivera et al., 2018; Pavlovich et al., 2018; Yan, 2015; Zhang et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2016) . Bats may thus possess a fortified IFN system that suppresses viruses down to levels of persistence (Dobson, 2005; Pavlovich et al., 2018; Wynne and Wang, 2013; Zhang et al., 2013) .",

Type III IFNs (IFN-l 1, 2, 3) are similar, but unlike the systemic type I IFNs they act locally on epithelial cells (Hamming et al., 2010) . IFN induction occurs by cellular sensing of viral RNA structures, resulting in the activation of IFN transcription factors, such as IRF3. The oncesecreted IFNs bind to their receptor, activate the transcription factors STAT1/2 via the JAK kinases, and drive the expression of multiple IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) with antiviral and immunomodulatory activity (Schoggins, 2014) .",

Members of both suborders are infected by a wide range of virus species (Calisher et al., 2006) . However, despite some progress, the contribution of the IFN response to their special ability to host viruses is not yet clarified. For Yinpterochiroptera such as Pteropus alecto, vampyrus or Rousettus aegyptiacus (all family Pteropodidae, or ''megabats' ') , several studies had measured the global transcriptional response of cells to infection with, e.g., Ebola, Marburg, Nipah, or Hendra virus (H\u00f6 lzer et al., 2016; Kuzmin et al., 2017; Wynne et al., 2014) or to the IFN-inducing Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) (Glennon et al., 2015) . By contrast, for the more diverse bat suborder Yangochiroptera (generically termed ''microbats'') there are just two virus-induced cell transcriptomes available (Gerrard et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2013) . However, the full virus response capability of bats remains uncharted because almost all cell response studies bar one (Glennon et al., 2015) with megabats and all studies with microbats employed wild-type viruses, which are weak IFN inducers. With respect to the response to IFN itself, there are expression profiles of cells from the megabat P. alecto (De La Cruz-Rivera et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2017) , and Shaw et al. recently conducted a pan-species comparison of IFN-stimulated cell transcriptomes, which included the megabat P. vampyrus and the Yangochiroptera microbat (family Vespertilionidae) Myotis lucifugus (Shaw et al., 2017) .",

Nonetheless, for Yangochiroptera microbats there are (1) no studies on the transcriptomal cell responses to an IFN-inducing virus and (2) only one study on the IFN-stimulated gene expression profile (Shaw et al., 2017) , which, however, focused on conserved ISGs.

M. daubentonii is a carrier of lyssaviruses prevailing from Europe to Japan (McElhinney et al., 2018) . On the phylogenetical tree, it is maximally separated from the previously studied Pteropodidae megabats (Teeling et al., 2018) . We stimulated M. daubentonii cells either with a strong IFN inducer virus or with type I IFN and measured global transcription at two different time points. Our results reveal several unique features like novel virus-response genes and an elevated number of paralogs of the antiviral ISG BST2. Unlike reported for megabats (Pavlovich et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2016) we could not detect different IFN-alpha subtypes or unusually high base levels of IFNs. Thus, besides exhibiting conserved antiviral responses and ISGs, several traits of the Yangochiroptera microbats are unique and not even observed for megabats.",

IFNs have anti-proliferative activity, which is the reason why many cell lines have lost their ability to induce IFN and/or to respond to IFN over their passaging history (Hess et al., 2012) . MyDauNi/2c cells, however, exhibited the typical phosphorylation of STAT1 in response to exogenously added pan-species IFN-a B/D ( Figure S1A ). Moreover, STAT1 phosphorylation was downmodulated by Ruxolitinib, an established inhibitor of JAK1/2-mediated IFN signaling (Stewart et al., 2014) . STAT1 phosphorylation and Ruxolitinib effect were comparable with the IFN-competent human A549 (Kuri et al., 2010; Weber et al., 2015) and the R. aegytiacus megabat cell line Ro6E-J (Fuchs et al., 2017) that we used in parallel.

RVFVDNSs::Renilla is a strong inducer of type I IFNs, is sensitive to the antiviral action of IFNs, and able to infect cells from a wide range of vertebrates (Kuri et al., 2010) . The built-in Renilla luciferase facilitates rapid and quantitative measurements of viral replication. Also, the M. daubentonii MyDauNi/2c cells could be infected with our reporter virus, permitting replication levels similar as in human A549 lung cell line or the fetal R. aegytiacus line Ro6E-J (Jordan et al., 2009) (Figure S1B) . Moreover, treatment with the IFN signaling inhibitor Ruxolitinib increased RVFVDNSs::Renilla replication, whereas IFN-a suppressed it. Although the cell lines are from different organs, these results, taken together, demonstrate that our immortalized Yangochiroptera/Vespertilionidae cell line MyDauNi/2c possesses a fully functional IFN system that is comparable with the one of human and megabat cell lines. Figure 1A gives an overview of the experimental setup. The MyDauNi/2c cells were either mock treated, infected with a strong IFN inducer (RVFV NSs mutant Clone 13) , or treated with 1,000 U/ml IFN-a. Total cell RNAs were isolated at 6 and 24 h post infection, and rRNA-depleted cDNA libraries were sequenced with 60-70 million strand-specific single-end reads per sample (Table S1 ). Of note, all experiments were performed in three independent, biological replicates.",

Based on pairwise comparisons of the mean values of the three replicates, protein-encoding genes that were induced or repressed by an absolute log2 fold change (FC) R 2 and with an adjusted p % 0.05 (DESeq2 (v1.16.1) [Love et al., 2014] ) were defined as significantly responding to either Clone 13 infection or IFN. To test whether biological replicates cluster together, we performed various principal component analyses (PCA) using our PCAGO web service (https://doi.org/10.1101/433078). In general, and visualized by the PCA based on the top 500 variant genes ( Figures 1B and S2A ), we found the biological replicates to cluster together. The PCA revealed that the transcriptomes of the 6-h post Clone 13 infection samples are closest to the mock samples and that the IFN-stimulated profiles of both time points are highly similar. The highest variance in the data (PC1 with 67,77%) can be explained by the large expression differences between the mock and Clone 13 6-h samples compared with the Clone 13 and IFN-stimulated 24-h samples. At 24 h, the Clone 13-infected cells show an expression pattern that is clearly distinguishable from all other conditions. One of the Clone 13 24-h replicates clustered somewhat apart from the other two replicates (see Figure 1B ), but the difference between these accounts for only 3.3% (PC2; Figure S2B ) of the whole variation in the gene expression data when directly compared with the mock 24-h samples. A 2D-and a 3D-PCA-movie, visualizing the overall stable clustering and how the principal components change by adding more and more less-variant genes to the transformation, can be found in the online supplement (Videos S1 and S2). CLARK classification and Krona visualization (Ondov et al., 2011) revealed 1% of the reads with high similarity to the RVFV reference genome in this specific sample, compared with 3%-4% in the other two replicates ( Figure S3 ). In addition to our reference-based analyses, we have created a comprehensive de novo transcriptome assembly for M. daubentonii by combining the output of various suitable assembly tools Grabherr et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2014) according to the results of H\u00f6 lzer and Marz (H\u00f6 lzer and Marz, 2019).",

By contrast, upregulated genes such as IRF7, MX1, MX2, OAS3, SAMD9, and USP18 are prototypical ISGs (Rusinova et al., 2013; Shaw et al., 2017) that most likely are activated by the Clone 13-induced IFN in the supernatant (see later discussion). Altogether the upregulated genes are commanding biological processes of the immediate-early innate response to viruses, as shown by GO term enrichment using the Piano package (Figure S4A , upper panel).",

SAMHD1, by contrast, was recently described as being IRF3 dependent in human, monkey, and porcine cells (Yang et al., 2016) . Among the late virus responders were also more unusual genes such as CSF2 or NEURL3. Both are weakly IFN stimulated in Rattus norvegicus but not in any other mammalian species (Shaw et al., 2017) . In M. daubentonii, CSF2 is exclusively virus inducible (see below) and NEURL3 is strongly virus as well as (weakly) IFN inducible. The genes upregulated at this later time point were functionally more diversified than the 6-h ones, as they promote adaptive immunity, apoptosis, and also RNA polymerase II activity, besides the innate immune response ( Figure S4A , lower panel). The genes downregulated at 24 h post infection were mostly involved in carbohydrate metabolism and protein transport.",

Therefore, beyond the bat-specific aspects this study was initiated for, we took advantage of our database to filter out genes that are uniquely regulated by either treatment. To address this issue, we compared gene expression at the 6-and 24-h time points of Clone 13 infection and IFN treatment with each other. Overall, running the two transcriptomes next to each other showed once more that at 6 h Clone 13 infection stimulated less genes (denominated as being ''downregulated'') than 6-h IFN treatment ( Figures 4A and 4B ). We could identify some genes that are upregulated exclusively by Clone 13, most prominently the prototypical, IRF3-driven virus-response gene IFNB1. When restricting ourselves to genes that were not at all regulated by IFN but upregulated by a log2 of more than 3 by virus (i.e., stricter than the log2-fold change of 2 filter we had set for the heatmaps), a similar virus-only response behavior was exhibited by other cytokines such as, e.g., CCL2, CCL4, IFNL3 (IFN-l3), and CSF2, and also by more untypical genes such as CH25H, ICAM1, and STEAP4.

Therefore, we verified our findings by RT-qPCR for the strongest early virus responders (IFNB1, CCL4, IFNL3, CH25H, STEAP4) and compared with the human system. Although being a late responder, CH25H (cholesterol 25-hydroxylase) is included because it is a powerful, broad-spectrum virus inhibitor. Human A549 and MyDauNi cells were infected with Clone 13, treated with IFN, or left untreated, and samples were taken 6 and 24 h later. Moreover, to exclude any potential cross talk by virus-triggered IFN, we kept in parallel cells under the JAK/STAT signaling inhibitor Ruxolitinib. In both the human and the Myotis cells, Ruxolitinib expectedly inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation and upregulation of the prototypical IFN-dependent ISG Mx1 ( Figure S7 ). The RT-qPCR data shown in Figure 5 demonstrate that IFNB1, CCL4, IFNL3, and CH25A are exclusively virus induced with no stimulation whatsoever by IFN. (Of note, a downmodulation of IFNB1 at 24 h post infection was detected by RT-qPCR but not by the less sensitive NGS [see Figure 2 ].) This was true for both the human and the M. daubentonii cells, indicating a conserved behavior. STEAP4 (six transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate), by contrast, was identified as a virus-only response gene in M. daubentonii cells but unresponsive to both IFN and Clone 13 in human cells.",

Thus, transcriptomes as well as most studies on individual ISGs could not clearly distinguish between primary (i.e., virus dependent) and secondary (virusinduced IFN) responses to infection, thus impeding a clear distinction of gene expressions that are unique for either of these triggers. Moreover, Ruxolitinib was not used before to systematically study IFN-independent cell responses to virus infection. Hence, we had aimed to clearly differentiate true virus-response genes from conventional ISGs indirectly activated by virus-induced IFN.

Thus, CH25H is a little conserved (and weak) ISG that we find in humans and M. daubentonii to be a novel and strong virusresponse gene.",

In fact, we could identify only a type I IFN gene with similarity to horse IFNW2 (IFN-u2) as being modestly IFN stimulated at the 6-h time point, where it reached a log2 fold change of 2.23 and a significant p value (see Figure 3 ). Another detectable type I IFN subtype (although it did not reach the significance threshold) was a relative to human IFNA5. Also Shaw et al. did not list any type I IFN in their pan-mammal transcriptome study (Shaw et al., 2017) An interesting feature of our M. daubentonii data was the detection of multiple paralogs of Mx and BST2. In the genome of the related M. lucifugus we identified three and four copies of Mx and BST2, respectively. Based on the M. lucifugus reference genome, M. daubentonii significantly upregulated either all three (Mx) or all four (BST2) genes ( Figure 6A ). Mx (myxovirus resistance protein) is a large cytosolic GTPase with a broad antiviral spectrum (Haller et al., 2015) . Almost all investigated vertebrate species express multiple paralogs (Haller et al., 2015) . Bat Mx proteins (including Mx1 of M. daubentonii) were shown to confer antiviral activity (Fuchs et al., 2017) . BST2 (bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2), also called Tetherin, is an antiviral transmembrane protein tethering enveloped virus particles to the plasma membrane (Douglas et al., 2010) . A search in the annotated genomes of mammals revealed that Yangochiroptera/Vespertilionidae such as Myotis lucifugus, brandtii und davidii, as well as Eptesicus fuscus harbor several copies of the The displayed genes were filtered by an absolute log2-fold change of 2 and an adjusted p value < 0.05. Genes that are similarly regulated at 6 and 24 h post IFN are clustered together. Data are averages from three biological replicates. Genes missing a gene name and a function in the current Ensembl annotation of M. lucifugus were listed by their unique and abbreviated ID numbers: e.g., ''ENSMLUG00000015795'' was shortened to ''15795.''

Using our M. daubentonii RNA-seq data, we were able to detect expression of four BST2 paralogs in the genome of M. lucifugus. However, two had an identical sequence (data not shown), so we confirm three BST2 paralogs with a differing sequence in the transcriptome of M. daubentonii. Thus, Vespertilionidae microbats are unique in harboring a multitude of BST2 paralogs, since all other species (except for sheep, which have two [Varela et al., 2017] ) have only one copy. Overall, our observations are that Yangochiroptera/Vespertilionidae microbats express a high number of paralogs of Mx and unexpectedly also BST2, two ISGs with a broad antiviral spectrum. This may indicate an increased capability to directly fend off virus infections.",

However, the group of ''bats'' is very heterogeneous and encompasses both Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, which have diverged since approximately 60 million years (Teeling et al., 2018) . For Yangochiroptera microbats, in contrast to megabats of the Yinpterochiroptera suborder, the IFN system is only poorly characterized. Here, we presented the time-dependent transcriptional profiles of M. daubentonii cells infected with a strong IFN inducer virus or treated with IFN. Our data revealed virus-triggered genes (CCL4, IFNL3, CH25H, STEAP4) that are not regulated by IFN itself, as well as the presence of multiple paralogs of directly antiviral ISGs such as Mx and BST2. CCL4 and IFNL3 attract immune cells and enhance local antiviral activity, respectively, and Mx, BST2, and CH25H are broad-spectrum virus inhibitors. Although our data are derived from a single cell line and may not be entirely generalizable, our analysis indicates that the Yangochiroptera microbat IFN system may exhibit features not observed for megabats or humans (STEAP4 as virus-response gene, at least 3 BST2 paralogs). Moreover, we report the absence of a series of megabat ISGs (EMC2, FILIP1, Figure 5 . RT-qPCR Confirmation of Virus-Only Response Genes Human A549 and M. daubentonii MyDauNi cells, treated or not with Ruxolitinib, were incubated with 1,000 U/ml IFN-a or infected with Clone 13 (MOI 5) for 6 or 24 h, respectively. Expression of IFNB1, CCL4, IFNL2/3 (A549)/IFNL3 (MyDauNi), CH25H, and STEAP4 were monitored by RT-qPCR.

If multiple hits for one sequence passed our filter settings, we selected the one with the best E-value. Based on this approach, we were able to assign a gene name and function to additional 4,844 sequences out of 7,101 CDS without a functional description in the Ensembl annotation for M. lucifugus.

Furthermore, we extracted three potential BST2 transcripts from the de novo transcriptome assembly of M. daubentonii. Interestingly, we were only able to identify three BST2-like transcripts with a differing sequence in the assembly. Overall, we aligned 18 BST2-coding sequences with MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013) (v7.402; L-INS-i parameter) and calculated a phylogenetic tree with RAxML",

They observed activation of IFNB1 and prototypical ISGs (e.g., DDX58, IFIH1, BST2, Mx1, or ISG15) and identified several novel ISGs, most prominently MORC3 (MORC family CW-type zinc finger 3). Subsequent RT-PCR analyses showed that this novel ISG was not consistently IFN dependent in cells from other bats but was NDV induced in all bat species, including the microbat Myotis velifer incautus(Glennon et al., 2015). In the pan-species IFN response comparisons of Shaw et al., MORC3 was identified as a core ISG(Shaw et al., 2017). Also, in our M. daubentonii transcriptomes, MORC3 was upregulated by IFN and Clone 13, although only weakly (see https://www.rna.uni-jena.de/ supplements/mda/report.html). Interestingly, MORC3 is known as a restriction factor of herpes viruses (Sloan et al., 2016) but a pro-viral factor for influenza virus(Ver et al., 2015).De la Cruz Vera et al. identified for the megabat P. alecto several genes that were not previously reported as being ISGs, namely, EMC2, FILIP1, IL17RC, OTOGL, SLC10A2, SLC24A1, and RNASEL(De La Cruz-Rivera et al., 2018). Our transcriptomes show that EMC2, FILIP1, IL17RC, OTOGL, and SLC24A1/2 are not ISGs in M. daubentonii, whereas RNASEL was confirmed. In fact, RNASEL is an ISG in most of the species investigated by Shaw et al. except for humans and chicken(Shaw et al., 2017), thus bolstering the conclusions of de la Cruz Vera et al.. Thus, the microbat ISG profile is distinct from the one of megabats.",
