A 75 kDa fragment of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) spike glycoprotein S was used as the model coronavirus antigen. The S glycoprotein was cloned into a Lactobacillus/E. coli shuttle vector (pLP500) where expression and secretion of the glycoprotein S from the recombinant lactobacilli was detected via immunoblotting. Oral immunization of BALB/c mice with recombinant LcS that constitutively expresses the 75 kDa fragment of the glycoprotein S, induced both local mucosal and systemic immune responses against TGEV. Maximum titers of IgG (8.38 \u00b1 0.19 ng/ml of serum) and IgA (64.82 \u00b1 2.9 ng/ml of intestinal water) were attained 32 days post oral inturbation. The induced antibodies demonstrated neutralizing effects on TGEV infection.",

            "text": "Although parenteral vaccination is usually highly effective in eliciting a protective immune response, the response obtained is not necessarily the one desired as many viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens enter the body via the mucosal surfaces. Effective protection against mucosal infections requires the development of vaccines that are able to induce protective local immune responses in order to neutralize the pathogen at its infection point [1, 2] . This can be achieved via oral vaccination where oral administration of antigens might stimulate the natural route of infection and be a more effective method of immunization [3] . The principle antibody type involved in mucosal immunity is secretory immunoglobulin A, the majority of which is released into the gastrointestinal fluid, saliva, tears, urine and other secretions [4, 5] . Besides being more convenient and less expensive, mucosal immunization offers several advantages over parenterally administered vaccines whereby it not only enhances vaccine efficacy by simultaneously inducing mucosal and systemic immunity, but also minimize adverse vaccine effects by avoiding direct contact between potentially toxic vaccine components and the systemic circulation [6, 7] .",

It has been estimated to cost US pig producers about 100 million dollars annually due to death or poor growth of infected pigs [15] . The viral genome consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense 28.5 kb RNA and is constructed of three major structural proteins: a phosphorylated nucleoprotein (N protein) and two glycoproteins, the membrane (M) and the spike (S) protein [16] . The S protein has a membrane-anchoring domain and is highly glycosylated. It is also thought to be the viral attachment protein which interacts with the cell receptor, porcine aminopeptidase N (APN) [17, 18] . As the major inducer of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies, the S protein has been used mainly for the induction of protective immunity to TGEV [19] [20] [21] . The protection of suckling piglets against TGEV infection is based on the uptake of specific lactogenic antibodies, mainly of the IgA class, in the milk of the TGEVimmune sows [22] .",

The detection of a 75 kDa rTGEV-S band on the respective membranes blotted with intestinal lavages and sera, indicated that mucosal and systemic immune responses against TGEV were elicited (Fig. 2) . The local response was further studied by measuring the anti-rTGEV-S IgA response in intestinal lavages post intragastric immunization. The concentration of mucosal IgA antibodies against rTGEV-S in the intestinal lavages was determined via ELISA, using purified TGEV-S-GST protein as coating antigen. Results were expressed as titers that were determined by expression of the test samples to a standard curve generated by serial dilution of commercially purchased IgA (ZYMED Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, USA) of known titer. As shown in Fig. 3 , there was no substantial difference in mucosal IgA levels between experimental group and control groups prior to intervention while oral immunization of rTGEV-S expressing strains elicited an antigenspecific mucosal IgA response. The antibody titer of the rTGEV-S specific response in BALB/c mice following immunization with recombinant LcS was detectable as rapidly as day 18, raising to titers of 3.98 \u00b1 0.18 ng/ml of lavage and 3.63 \u00b1 0.19 ng/ml of lavage by day 32 and 48, respectively. Since an approximate volume of 2 ml of intestinal lavage was extracted from each mouse, the maximum amount of IgA in the entire intestinal tract would be 7.96 \u00b1 0.36 ng. From the estimation of a previous study [31] , it was derived that the intestinal water covering the surface of the entire gastrointestinal tract of mice adds up to 122.8 \u00b1 3.2 mg. As such, the maximum titer of IgA induced by oral administration of recombinant LcS amounted to 64.82 \u00b1 2.9 ng/ml of intestinal water.

It is therefore important to develop vaccines that induce protective immune responses where initial infection and replication of the pathogen is prevented at the mucosa via the mucosal immunity, mediated predominantly by secretory IgA [32] . Furthermore, since most viral infections that have gained entrance through the mucosal surfaces will become systemic, the vaccines should also elicit specific immunity in the systemic lymphoid tissues. With the widespread threat of many emerging pathogenic viruses (such as SARS Coronavirus, Hantan and influenza viruses) to human life, challenges have been spawned to develop safe anti-viral vaccine for preventive use. As such, a great deal of research is currently focused on the development of adequate mucosal vaccines, with various vaccine delivery systems being explored for oral application.",

In this study, we engineered for the first time, a Lactobacillus spp. to express a coronaviral protein, TGEV S protein, into the exter-nal milieu. A 75 kDa band corresponded to the expected size of rTGEV-S, was detected in the supernatant of overnight recombinant LcS culture when probed with convalescent swine serum. Hence, indicating that the recombinant LcS was able to express and secrete S protein fragment without compromising its antigenic properties. IgA is the predominant antibody at the mucosal surface as it is locally produced at a level that exceeds that of all of other immunoglobulins. Therefore, it is likely that to be effective, an oral TGEV vaccine will have to induce a specific intestinal IgA response. The recombinant LcS was shown to be able to elicit both mucosal and systemic humoral responses after oral immunization in mice, which is in agreement with a study conducted by Enjuanes and coworkers [33] . Likewise, Enjuanes and coworkers developed an attenuated strain of Salmonella typhimurium expressing the amino terminus of TGEV S protein. However, the protein fragment encoded by the constructed S. typhimurium lacks the antigenic domain A of S protein. Nevertheless, specific immune responses against TGEV were induced by the recombinant S. typhimurium, though the protective effects of the elicited antibodies were not assessed. On comparison of the two delivery systems illustrated above, the probiotic effects and the harmless nature of Lactobacillus spp. would render it more appropriate an oral vaccine carrier as to a natively pathogenic bacteria.",

Serum and intestinal samples collected from mice fed with rTGEV-S expressing LcS demonstrated statistically significant inhibition (14-16% reduction in plaque formation) of plaque formation by TGEV. Interestingly, despite the lack of posttranslational modifications in prokaryotic expression system, the 75 kDa fragment of TGEV S protein expressed by LcS was recognized by convalescent swine serum, and able to elicit significant immune protection, albeit low level against TGEV. In a study conducted by Hu et al., inoculation of animals with recombinant E. coli expressing high levels of glycoprotein S did not induce neutralizing antibodies or confer protection in vivo [35] . On the other hand, Escribano and coworkers have developed arabidopsis transgenic plants expressing N-terminal domain of TGEV S protein that elicited neutralizing antibodies when used to immunize mice [36] . The use of plant as an oral vaccine delivery vehicle however, would only result in short-term induction of the immune system against the expressed antigen and hence, requires consistent and frequent feeding of mice with the transgenic plant if long-term effect is desired. In contrast, the development of a delivery system like Lactobacillus spp. that is able to adhere and colonize the intestinal tract, permits continuous expression of antigen in the intestine, resulting in extended protection of the vaccinated subject from TGEV infection. It was shown in this study that 6.04 \u00d7 10 3 to 6.89 \u00d7 10 4 of the orally fed LcS was able to adhere to the intestinal tract of mice, where the percentage of LcS that remained in the intestinal tract after the initial attachment as of day 1 varies from 10.60 to 33.60%. In particular, the amount of LcS that remain attached were maintained at a fairly constant percentage of 32.58-34.33% and 30.48-37.21% in the jejunum and ileum respectively, indicating that at least one-third of the LcS which had adhered to the jejunum and ileum were retained in the intestinal tract for a week. The recombinant LcS generated in this study also demonstrates similar adhesion and colonization capability as its native counterpart (results not shown). As such, oral immunization regime could be developed based on the adherence ability of the vaccine carrier. In our case, single dose of the lactobacilli vaccine is required instead of three consecutive doses at each immunization, and booster doses administered at intervals of 7 days instead of 14 days would be sufficient for consistent expression of TGEV spike protein in the intestine.",
