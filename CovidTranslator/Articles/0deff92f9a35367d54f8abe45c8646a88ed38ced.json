Some of the current markers in clinical use do not provide optimal sensitivity and specificity, with the prostate cancer antigen (PSA) being one of many such examples. The emergence of proteomic techniques and systems approaches to study disease pathophysiology has rekindled the quest for new biomarkers. In particular the use of protein microarrays has surged as a powerful tool for large scale testing of biological samples. Approximately half the reports on protein microarrays have been published in the last two years especially in the area of biomarker discovery. In this review, we will discuss the application of protein microarray technologies that offer unique opportunities to find novel biomarkers.",

Biomarkers are surrogate measurements that enable the prediction of a clinical or physiological state. Ideally, they are easy to measure, inexpensive, non-invasive and highly accurate in making their intended predictions. In clinical practice, there are a handful of biomarkers in use today [1, 2] . For example, elevated troponin in serum suggests myocardial infarction [3] , increases in some cancer antigen levels, like CA 125 and PSA, are used to detect and monitor ovarian and prostate cancer, respectively [4, 5] . The detection of autoantibodies to antinuclear proteins may reveal patients with autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus [6] . The increasing shift towards personalizing the care of individuals based upon their specific disease has created a greater demand for biomarkers that can both diagnose and stratify patients. Yet, there exist no biomarkers for the majority of diseases and the sensitivity and specificity of many current markers are not ideal. Despite this large demand, the current rate of discovery of validated molecular diagnostic markers is on the decline.",

Protein microarrays allow for the simultaneous and rapid analysis of thousands of proteins in highthroughput (HT).

However, significant challenges still remain to develop, validate and apply these technologies effectively to identify biomarkers for clinical use.

The authors tested 115 pairs of antibody-antigen interactors in the context of protein arrays. Despite strong evidence that all of these antibodies bound well in solution assays, they found that on the arrays, 60% of printed antibodies could detect their cognate antigens in a pool of all 115 antigens, and only 20% of the antibodies could quantitatively detect differences in the concentrations of the antigen. This study illustrates that although many antibodies work well as solution-based detection reagents, only a fraction of them may work when printed on arrays. This may be due to loss of antibody activity by denaturation during printing or array storage. Alternatively, it might reflect that many antibodies are characterized against denatured protein and thus recognize linear epitopes. When antigens are added to the arrays in solution, the linear epitopes may be buried in the folded protein. Many antibodies that work well on westerns and ELISAs fail to work for immunoprecipitation, for example. Interestingly, when the experiment was inverted, that is, antigen arrays were probed with a pool of antibodies; a much larger number of antibody-antigen pairs were both detected and behaved quantitatively. Finally, as the authors point out, certain antigens may be more labile or sensitive to direct labeling whereas antibodies are more likely to label uniformly. This early work by Haab et al. demonstrated the use of antibody arrays for measuring low concentrations of analyte, and highlights the importance of qualifying antibodies for use with microarrays.",

The authors used cancer cell lysates from cells that had been treated with and without direct exposure to radiation to probe an antibody array comprising 146 antibodies. The proteins from each treatment were differentially labeled with dual color fluorophores and mixed together. Cross labeling of the lysates was done to avoid the experimental bias due to dye effects. Several antigens were up regulated in radiation-induced cells, namely p53, DFF44 and 45, ICAD as well as TRAIL among others. A majority of the proteins were unchanged while one protein, CEA, was down regulated. This study demonstrated the first use of antibody arrays to monitor changes in levels of antigens in fluorescently labeled complex protein samples. Because the measurements of these candidate antigens relied on the specificity of only a single targeting antibody, the authors confirmed the specificity of their findings using an immunoblot assay.",

            "text": "Several technical issues arise with the use of direct protein labeling, including differential labeling efficiencies and the need to rely solely on the specificity of the printed capture antibody for specificity. To reduce the risk of cross reactivity, Huang et al. used a sandwich assay to measure the levels of 24 cytokines in conditioned media and patient sera [10] . Using antibody pairs that recognize different epitopes on a single antigen, one antibody was immobilized on the array to capture the antigen and the other coupled to HRP for chemiluminescent detection (Fig. 1B) . The sensitivity and dynamic range for detecting cytokines by this approach was comparable to or better than that obtained with commercial ELISAs. The improved specificity of a sandwich assay minimizes concerns about aberrant signals from cross reacting signals from single antibodies. However, there exist only a limited set of antibodies that can satisfy the requirements for a sandwich assay: first, the need for two high quality antibodies that recognize different epitopes on the antigen and, second, the absence of cross reactivity between the antibodies and the other antigens being tested in the assay. In the case of cytokines, there are numerous well-established antibody pairs that can be used in sandwich immunoassays; however, for most antigens, compatible antibody pairs with good antigen specificity do not yet exist.",

Several antigens were found to be differentially expressed in cancer patients. Miller et al profiled fluorescently labeled prostate cancer sera and identified five proteins that differed in cancer patient sera [12] . In this study, the authors improved their detection limit of the antigens by 6 fold to 200 ng/mL by using a three dimensional acrylamide gel surface as opposed to the traditional chemically derivatized planar surface. Improved sensitivity may reflect a higher binding capacity of the surface or the improved ability to preserve antibody function. Using this chemistry, they observed that the detected antigens were mostly abundant proteins in serum with concentrations in either micrograms or milligrams per milliliter of sera. For antigens like PSA, typically found in the range of nanograms per milliliter, only sera with highly abundant PSA were detected.",

An approach developed by S\u00f6derlind et al. [19] , relied on producing only the single chain variable fragments (scFv) of an antibody that still contained the antigen recognition motif. The resulting product was a fifth in size of a whole antibody, but retained specificity and can be stably produced in E. coli at high levels [19] . The use of recombinant scFv represents a novel twist on the antibody arrays that hold great promise for biomarker discovery. Borrebaeck and colleagues selected human recombinant scFv antibody fragments from a large phage display library for developing recombinant scFv capture arrays [18] [19] [20] . To improve the limit of detection for profiling low-abundant protein analytes in nonfractionated samples, the authors selected surface chemistries with improved binding capacity for the scFvs. They also labeled the analyte with biotin allowing the amplification of the signal using fluorescently labeled streptavidin. This approach yielded picomolar sensitivity for the multiplexed analysis of low abundance analytes in complex samples [21] [22] [23] (Fig. 2A) .",

An array of 127 scFv antibodies was constructed to identify a protein expression signature in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma in the setting of Helicobacter pylori infection. This study showed altered levels of interleukins (IL-2, IL-6, IL-9 etc), INF-\u03b1, and TGF-\u03b2 in tissue infected with H. pylori. The further onset of tumor resulted in the altered abundance of other interleukins (IL-8, IL-4, IL-16 etc) as well as complement proteins (C5, C1a) and monocyte chemotactic proteins (MCP -1, -3, and -4; however, these findings were not further experimentally validated [24] . Another study used a 129 recombinant scFv antibody microarray directed against 60 serum proteins to classify metastatic breast cancer patients and healthy controls, based on differential serum protein profiling [25] . Using a limited number of serum samples (20 healthy controls and 20 breast cancer patients), the authors identified differences in the levels of abundance for 15% of the tested proteins. The changes were mostly observed among several interleukins (IL-5, IL-7, IL-8) and complement proteins (C3, C4, C5). For two antigens (IL-8 and IL-7), the observed changes in abundance between control and disease was observed by two different scFv's targeting the same antigen adding assurance that the responses reflect changes in the specific target antigen. It is more difficult to explain the cases where multiple scFv's were available to an antigen but only one showed significant changes in signal. These observations require follow up experiments to eliminate concerns about cross reacting signals. However, these early studies identified several candidate tumor associated inflammatory markers like IL-8, IL-7 as well as complement proteins like C3 and C5 with altered levels in the serum of breast cancer patients and the tissue of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma but not in the tissue of H. pylori infected tissue. These findings require further validation, but they demonstrate the potential for recombinant antibody microarrays in biomarker discovery.",

The use of RPA presupposes that the researcher has already identified analytes of interest and has access to very high quality antibodies available for use on the arrays. Fundamentally, RPA is a single antibody assay. Thus, identifying antibodies of sufficient specificity requires careful screening for antibody specificity by western blot as well as other methods to ensure there will be no crossreactivity in reporting signal [44] . Moreover, it is essential to confirm any findings from RPA using traditional assays, such as monitoring changes by western blot. Thus, RPA fits between a pure discovery tool and a validation tool.",

Phage-based cDNA expression libraries were generated from the relevant cancer tissue and used to produce a large number of tumor antigens in E. coli [47] . The advantage of this approach is that the expression library derives from genes expressed in the tumor, thus producing antigens that are likely to be relevant to the disease. This approach has been successful in discovering over 2,000 antigens relevant to cancer [47, 51] . Most of the antigens discovered to date by SEREX still remain to be validated in controlled studies to determine if the responses are disease specific.",

These arrays allow large number of antigens to be tested across many serum samples simultaneously. Moreover, because replicate arrays can be tested on both patient and control sera, discovery and initial validation can be done in a single step. Some of the earlier work with antigen microarrays focused on validating them for the detection of serum antibodies. Antigen microarrays rely on printing small amounts of antigen onto microscopic features on a planar surface as opposed to coating macroscopic plate wells (Fig. 4A) . This raises concerns about the integrity of antigens during printing and storage and whether adequate antigen is presented on the array for sensitive detection. The first test of antigen micorarrays to monitor immune responses was demonstrated by Joos et al [52] . Well known recombinant autoantigens such as Ro and La for Sjorgren's syndrome, CENP B for Crest syndrome, antinuclear antigens for rheumatoid arthritis and several others were purified either from insect cells, E. coli or tissue and then printed onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The arrays were probed with autoimmune serum containing documented antigenic responses, and the expected selective binding of the serum antibodies to their respective antigens was observed in all cases. To test the sensitivity of detection, the authors performed serial dilution of the serum and established detection limits for serum antibody binding to five autoantigens. In most cases, sensitivities were comparable to standard ELISAs. However in some cases, they noted that sensitivity of the protein spotted arrays was adversely affected upon storage.",

These arrays were then probed either with pooled sera from patients with alopecia areata or with plasma from individual patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) [54] [55] [56] [57] . The authors identified 23 antigens which elicited an immune response in two or more pools of patient sera with alopecia areata and 48 antigens in two or more patients with DCM [55] . To confirm the responses, the antigens were purified and printed on a focused array to test individual sera from patients and controls. In the alopecia areata study, 8 of the 23 antigens were confirmed, while 26 of 48 antigens continued to show elevated responses in patients with DCM.

They found that 70% (47/67) of the tested antigens were immunogenic in at least one patient, responses to nine of the antigens tested were shared by at least three patients and response to an outer membrane protein called OpaV was detected in over 50% of the patients tested. Another study by Zhu et al focused on identifying immune responses in patients from Canada and China who suffered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to infection by the coronavirus [67] . They constructed an array representing 82 proteins from six coronaviruses and tested sera from infected patients and healthy controls. In a small double blinded study using 56 serum samples of patients and controls, they found the coronavirus protein microarray was able to classify the patients with 100% sensitivity and 95% specificity. Again, they observed that antigen microarrays were as sensitive or in some cases more sensitive than commercially available ELISAs for detecting immune response to viral antigens.",

They used multiple MS based approaches in follow-up experiments to identify 21 immunoreactive antigens found in 3 fractions or more [78] .

First, it provides a rapid source of antigens without the need to generate cDNA expression libraries or rely on the availability of cloned ORFs. Second, it can be extended to tissue from patients that may contain relevant proteins for testing, such as proteins with native or disease-specific PTMs or aberrant gene products. This unbiased approach does not require any information a priori about which antigens to test. A related method developed by Qin et al, called the reverse capture array, also relied on cellular antigens for testing serum antibodies (Fig. 4B) [79] . To isolate the native antigens from cells, the authors used a commercial antibody array containing 500 antibodies. Cell lysates from prostate cancer cell lines were incubated with the antibody array to allow the appropriate antigens to bind to their cognate target antibodies. As a test of antibody occupancy, in a separate experiment, fluorescently labeled lysate was added to the arrays revealing that most of the antibodies (90%) were bound by labeled protein. To determine if any of the captured antigens were recognized by serum antibodies, serum IgG was purified from pooled sera and directly labeled prior to incubating with the antigen bound array. Two antigens namely, 53BP2 and MUPP1, were found to be elevated in serum response, which was later confirmed by western blot analysis. A following study using individual serum samples as opposed to pooled sera failed to identify MUPP1 as a dominant response and 53BP2 was not tested [80] . In this study, response to MUPP1 was observed only in a small subset of patients but was not considered significant. This raises concerns about pooling sera where strong responses from a single serum may dominate the outcome.",

This minimizes redundancy and provides template for full length genes unlike conventional cDNA libraries. Recent work by Hudson et al used a commercially available human protein array with 5,005 proteins printed in duplicate to test sera from patients with ovarian cancer [83] . The proteins were expressed using sf9 insect cells, purified via a glutathione S transferase (GST) fusion protein, and printed onto a nitrocellulose membrane. They found a somewhat surprisingly large number, 15% (730/5005), of proteins had specific responses to sera from patients and not from the healthy controls. However, the responses were not sufficient to differentiate cancer from healthy individuals. The authors sought to measure the amounts of selected immunogenic antigens in the ovarian tissue and found that Lamin A/C, SSRP1, and RALBP1 showed high levels of staining when compared to non cancerous tissue isolated from the same individual. An advantage of using partially purified protein is that proteins are in a readily addressable format that is not obscured by an overabundance of highly expressed proteins.",

Antibody microarrays have been used for profiling biological samples like serum for disease specific peptide antigens. However, most approaches have relied on single antibody measurements which are often not specific enough and have the possibility for cross reacting with other protein species. This approach requires orthogonal tests to confirm the specificity of the signals. The risk of cross reacting signal can be considerably reduced by sandwich assays; however, well-established antibody pairs for most antigens do not exist. There is tremendous need for highly specific antibodies or alternative high affinity capture reagents that can function in the context of a protein microarray.",

There are large collections of ORF libraries and increasing number of techniques readily available for the production and detection of proteins. Efforts from several groups such as the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) and others have made significant strides toward the systematic collection of biological samples from a variety of diseases for testing. The culmination of these advances has enabled the identification of several candidate serum antigen and antibody markers for several diseases including infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases and cancer. What remains is the clinical validation of these markers to measure their utility as biomarkers.",

(B) Sandwich immunoassay -detection of a captured analyte is accomplished with a fluorescently labeled second antibody that binds to a different epitope than the capture antibody. The direct labeling approach depends entirely on the specificity of the capture antibody and is therefore more prone to aberrant signal. Samples (e.g. lysates or body fluids) are incubated and native antigens captured by the antibodies on an array. Immunoglobulins are purified from patient sera and labeled with different cyanine dyes (Cy3 and Cy5), which are then added to the captured antigens on the array. In both cases slides are scanned and data analyzed. Antigen confirmation -if investigators validated hits by other experimental methods e.g. western blot, ELISA, Immunohistochemistry (+ indicates yes, -indicates no). Validation -Unless otherwise noted, the biomarkers listed here were not validated in an independent sample set of patients and controls",
