Methods: Methods included family interviews; review of medical records, radiographs, and pathology slides; serology; selective stool culture; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for fecal viral detection; and immunocytochemlstry. Results: In both families multiple cases occurred among siblings in 7-13-month periods. There appeared to be a 4-&year recurrence of new disease in both families. Radiographs showed a remarkable similarity in the pattern of disease, confined to distal ileum and cecum, in the members of family 1. Examination for pathology showed granulomas in all 8 patients for whom tissues were available. Acid-fast organisms or Carnpylobacter-like organisms were not found in tissue sections, and immunocytochemistry was negative for mycobacteria and Yersinia. Stool cultures were negative for mycobacteria, Yersinia, and Mycoplasma. Torovirus and coronavirus antigens were not found in stool. Serology was negative for antibodies to Bruce/la, Yersinia, influenza, and three enteropathogenic viruses of animals. Conclusions: The circumstances and data suggest that an infectious microorganism is responsible for these clusterings of Crohn's disease.",

The first study concluded that the occurrence of three cases within 10 months in members of a family living in the same house was evidence for an environmental etiology; the second study found an absence of HLA linkage in fa-milial Crohn's disease. In view of the rarity of such high frequencies of Crohn's disease among family members, we initiated an in-depth study of the two French families.",

The uniformity of ileal and cecal disease in family 1 is akin to that which might be expected had a uniform dose of an enteric pathogen been given to a genetically uniform group of experimental subjects, e.g., a litter of mice or piglets.

Normally human sera do not block the signal in the Breda virus ELISA; therefore, the titers seen in six patients and two unaffected family members are remarkable. However, we found no evidence of Breda virus antigen in the stools of these individuals. Lamouliatte et al. reported aggregation of a bovine Breda virus with convalescent serum from a human patient with diarrhea as tested by immunoelectron microscopy.28 With the exception of this one case, the patients described here are the first humans showing serologic evidence of torovirus infection, even though several investigators have studied that possibility.29,30 CLOs were never demonstrated. We tested for a possible serologic response to influenza A and B because of a reported association with flare-ups of IBD3' and because early-in-life viral infecshowed no elevated titers; however, acute and convalescent phase sera were not available for comparison. During the summer of 1991, we became aware of gastrointestinal illness in the wife of one of the sons in family 1. Pedigree analysis showed no evidence of consanguinity between this spouse and family 1 or with family 2 over three generations, dating to 1880. Now a woman of 30 years of age, she met patient IB in 1977 (at age 16), 3 years after his first symptoms. They were married in 1983, and there is evidence that her first intestinal symptoms were noted in September 1984 (at age 23). A diagnosis of Crohn's disease was made in September 1991, for which surgical resection was performed October 24, 199 1.
