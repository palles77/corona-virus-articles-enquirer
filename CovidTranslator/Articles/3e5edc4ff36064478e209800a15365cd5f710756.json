COVID-19 rapidly spreads in China and to other parts of the world. Currently more than 70,000 laboratory-confirmed cases in China have been reported, and the case count has been rising daily. Some travelersrelated transmission were also identified in many countries, including Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, Germany, France, United States (U.S.), Australia, etc. through an international conveyance, and raised a global health emergency. 1 As of February 18, 2020, there were 22 confirmed cases in Taiwan.

Owing to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan city and the announcement of related symptoms, she was immediately placed in quarantine ward and underwent examination. Although the patient denied spending time at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and reported no known contact with ill people during her stay in Wuhan, specimens including oropharyngeal swab and sputum were collected for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) in accordance with the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (TCDC) guidance.",

Before seeking medical treatment in Taiwan, she bought over-the-counter medicine to release the symptoms. After admission to our hospital, her vital signs remained stable, apart from the exertional dyspnea, intermittent dry cough and sore throat (Fig. 1) . The initial physical examination revealed a BT of 36.4 C, blood pressure of 93/53 mm Hg, pulse of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breath/min, and SPO2 of 91% while the patient was breathing supplement oxygen by nasal cannula at 3 L/min. The breathing sound was normal initially. The laboratory results reflected lymphopenia (531 cells/ul), and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST, 78 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, 41 U/L), C-reactive protein (CRP, 7.8 mg/ L), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, 295 U/L) (Fig. 1) . A rapid screening test for influenza A and B showed negative. The chest X-ray revealed bilateral perihilar infiltration and ill-defined patchy opacities. On January 21, 2020, the TCDC confirmed that the patient's oropharyngeal swab and sputum tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR assay.",

            "text": "We reported the first confirmed case of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in Taiwan. In accordance with the first report from China, the major symptoms of COVID-19 infection were mainly cough, fever and dyspnea. 2 Our case presented with mild fever, dyspnea and mild hypoxemia on day 10 of initial illness. At the same time, the chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrating pneumonia, which progressed diffusely later. The progression of symptoms in this case also coincided with the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the U.S., with fever on day 5 of illness, dyspnea with mild hypoxemia and radiographical pneumonia on day 9 of illness. 3 Furthermore, reports from China showed all patients had bilateral pneumonia on high resolution CT with different severity even in mild cases. 2, 4 These findings suggested that lower respiratory tract seems to be an important location for the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Our case turned afebrile since admission (illness day 10), even without antiviral treatment. Despite pneumonia on chest Xrays worsen in the following seven days, respiratory failure did not occur eventually. Even though ceftriaxone was used, the evidence of negative culture and the worsening chest X-ray findings under antibiotic treatment were not compatible with the clinical picture of bacterial pneumonia. The effective medical treatment against COVID-19 remains unknown. In spite of the first-reported case in the U.S. showing promptly-subsided fever after Remdesivir used on day 12 of illness, with well-improved clinical symptoms later, the effectiveness of Remdesivir was still questioned. 3 The randomized-controlled trial of treating Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus by the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir/interferon-beta-1b is ongoing, more evidence-based data are needed. 5 Some laboratory abnormalities in our case, such as elevated CRP, LDH, ALT and AST, were also observed in influenza virus pandemic. 6 Lymphopenia has been considered as a poor prognostic factor for severe hospitalized influenza (H1N1) pandemic 2009, 7 as well as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 8 These findings may explain common biomarker presentation in viral pneumonia, including COVID-19. The quarantine period for potentially COVID-19 infected individuals was challenging by our case's laboratory results, her sputum specimens remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 on day 15 and turned negative on day 17 of illness.",

The worst status of her pneumonia was on illness day 17 (Fig. 2c) and then gradually resolved. Given the negative rRT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 on illness day 21 and 23, there were persistent milder bilateral lung opacities on the chest radiograph on illness day 25 (Fig. 2d) which were corresponding to bilateral ill-defined GGO patches with or without reticulation, and mild fibrotic change on CT two days later (Fig. 3) . Chest CT might be a tool to assist diagnosis accompanying with symptoms and traveling history, because the chest radiograph could be normal in those patients with mild or no symptoms. 3 In summary, our case revealed a natural course of NCP with self-recovery. Rapid diagnostic assays, effective treatment and wide use of chest CT will be crucial to contain the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 in the future.",
