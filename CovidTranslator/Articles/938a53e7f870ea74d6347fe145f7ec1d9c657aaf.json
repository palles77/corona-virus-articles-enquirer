In the anatomic model, liver lobules are organized into irregular polygons demarcated by connective tissue and composed of plates of hepatocytes radiating outward from the central vein to the portal triads ( Figure  61 -1). The hepatic acinus is the functional unit of the liver. In the functional model hepatocytes are instead oriented around the afferent vascular system (portal veins and hepatic arteries) just as they anastomose into sinusoids ( Figure 61-1) , and the central vein is at the periphery of the acinus instead of centrally located as in the anatomic model. The acinus is divided into three contiguous zones (1, 2, and 3) that correspond to distance from the arterial blood supply. Those hepatocytes in closest proximity to the arterioles (zone 1) receive the greatest oxygen content, but are also first in line to be affected by toxins transported from the gut to the portal vein. Zone 3 hepatocytes reside at the periphery of the acinus near the central vein, and zone 2 hepatocytes are interspersed between zone 1 and zone 3 hepatocytes. The anatomic model is perhaps easier to understand, but the functional model serves as a better foundation for understanding liver pathology. 1 In either model portal venous and arterial blood flow centripetally, that is, toward the central vein, whereas bile flows centrifugally, that is, away from the central vein. Hepatocytes extract nutrients and oxygen from portal and arterial perfusion, respectively, and produce bile acids and other bile constituents that are transported from hepatocytes into bile canaliculi, ductules, and ducts.",

The biliary tract is a convergent system of canals that begins in the canaliculi, followed by the bile ducts, and ending with the common bile duct. Bile secretion depends on the function of membrane transport systems in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes and on the structural and functional integrity of the biliary tract. The hepatocytes, constituting the most abundant liver cell population, generate the so-called primary bile in their canaliculi. Biliary canaliculi are blind tubular structures, with a very high surface-to-volume ratio that by means of osmotic gradients favors the formation of bile flow. Cholangiocytes, which constitute 3% to 10% of the liver cells, modify the canalicular bile by secretory and reabsorptive processes as bile passes through the bile ducts, and they are responsible for approximately 30% of bile volume. In contrast to hepatocytes, where secretion is constant and poorly controlled, cholangiocyte secretion is broadly regulated. 5, 6 the immunoglobulin family, without which the liver cannot clear complement system-coated pathogens.",

Ethanol activates the Toll-like receptor 4 and CD14, receptors on the Kupffer cell that internalize the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. Internalization activates the transcription of TNF-\u03b1 and production of superoxide (a prooxidant). TNF-\u03b1 then enters the stellate cell in the liver, leading to collagen synthesis and fibrosis.

[7] [8] [9] [10] In physiologic conditions, these cells play pivotal roles in the regulation of vitamin A homeostasis. In pathologic conditions, such as hepatic fibrosis or liver cirrhosis, HSCs lose vitamin A and synthesize a large amount of ECM components, including collagen, proteoglycan, glycosaminoglycan, and adhesive glycoproteins. The morphology of these cells also changes from that of the star-shaped stellate cell to that of the fibroblast or myofibroblast. HSCs are now considered to be targets of therapy of hepatic fibrosis or liver cirrhosis. 11 Activation of HSCs, a key event in liver fibrosis, is caused by diminished adipogenic transcription. 12 Wnt signaling inhibits antiadipogenic activation of HSCs and liver fibrogenesis; wnt antagonism inhibits HSC activation and liver fibrosis. 9",

Kupffer cells begin their development in the bone marrow with the genesis of promonocytes and monoblasts into monocytes, and then on to peripheral blood monocytes, completing differentiation into Kupffer cells within the liver. In health, Kupffer cells are involved in the metabolism of erythrocyte hemoglobin. During perfusion of the liver, senescent red blood cells are phagocytized by the Kupffer cells, and the hemoglobin molecule is further metabolized into its component parts. Globin chains and amino acids are reutilized; the iron-containing portion of heme is removed, transported, and stored; and heme is further oxidized into bilirubin, conjugated with glucuronic acid within hepatocytes, and secreted into the bile. Kupffer cells also express a complement receptor of progenitor cells have multilineage potential and similar characteristics to stem cells. The late progenitor cells have differentiated further and produce progeny in only a single lineage. Although they divide rapidly, they are capable of only a short-term tissue reconstitution and they do not self-renew. 15 Early studies in hepatocyte turnover and liver regeneration showed that the parenchymal cell, the hepatocyte, was the primary and only cell involved in tissue renewal. However, new studies of liver regeneration, hepatocarcinogenesis, liver transplantation, and various cell lines show that a variety of cell types participate in maintaining hepatocyte number and mass. Recent studies indicate the presence of both intrahepatic and extrahepatic stem/progenitor cell populations that serve to maintain the normal organ and to regenerate damaged parenchyma in response to a variety of insults. The intrahepatic compartment most likely derives primarily from the biliary tract, particularly the most proximal branches, that is, the canals of Hering and smallest ductules. The extrahepatic compartment is at least in part derived from diverse populations of cells from the bone marrow. Embryonic stem cells are considered as a part of the extrahepatic compartment. 16 The precise role(s) of each of these individual cells remains to be determined, but it is clear that in the aggregate they confer the vast regenerative capacity of the liver .",

Pit cells use the FasL Fas ligand (FasL) and perforin/granzyme pathway to kill target cells. FasL on effector cells binds the Fas that is present on the target cell membrane, which results in oligomerization of Fas and activation of caspase 8. Perforin and granzymes, of which granzyme B is the most potent, reside in granules of the cytotoxic lymphocytes and are released by exocytosis. Intracellular delivery of granzyme B results in the initiation of the caspase cascade by proteolytic activation of caspase 3, either directly or through a mitochondrial-dependent pathway.

Once captured, the leukocyte can receive activating messages presented by endothelial cells in the form of chemokines that activate specific G-protein-coupled receptors on the leukocyte surface. Occupancy of these receptors triggers a cascade of intracellular signals that results in the presentation of high-affinity integrin receptors on the leukocyte surface that bind to immunoglobulin family of counterreceptors on the endothelium to promote leukocyte arrest on the vessel wall.

In spite of that, a generally acceptable consensus defines a stem cell as an undifferentiated cell that has capacity to self-renew, for production of progeny in at least two lineages, for long-term tissue repopulation after transplantation, and for serial transplantability. In addition, stem cells exist in a mitotically quiescent form and clonally regenerate all of the different cell types that constitute the tissue in which they exist. They can undergo asymmetrical cell division, with production of one differentiated (progenitor) daughter and another daughter that is still a stem cell. The offspring of stem cells are referred to as progenitor cells, also named as transit amplifying cells and therefore cannot be serially transplanted, and are classified as early and late. The early progenitor or stem/ either removed from the circulation by the liver or undergo further transformation by lipoprotein lipase and/or hepatic lipase to form intermediate-density lipoproteins and LDLs. LDLs, which are relatively depleted of triglyceride and enriched in cholesteryl esters and phospholipid, circulate in the blood and bind to specific LDL receptors that are widely distributed throughout tissues in order to deliver cholesterol. HDLs produced by the liver play an important role as donors and acceptors of apo C, apo E, and various lipids from other lipoproteins in the circulation.",

Lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase esterifies HDL cholesterol and cholesteryl esters move to the core of the HDL molecule to allow more free cholesterol to be absorbed into the particle. Continued absorption of free cholesterol and subsequent esterification by lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase leads to the formation of the larger, cholesteryl ester-rich HDL2s. HDL2 molecules continuously acquire cholesteryl esters, resulting in the formation of the HDL1 molecules. On HDL1, cholesteryl esters are transferred from tissues to the liver for disposal or reuse, and not to LDL or VLDL molecules (as in humans), which transfer cholesterol to peripheral tissues. This function of HDL1s may account for the lower incidence of atherosclerotic disorders in dogs compared with humans. 23, 24 Nucleic Acids Pyrimidine biosynthesis is one of the classic roles of the liver in nucleic acid metabolism. More recently, microRNAs have been impugned in the normal development and regeneration of the liver, as well as in hepatic pathology. microRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that regulate both messenger RNA and protein expression of target genes, which results in alterations in messenger RNA stability or translation inhibition. microRNAs influence at least one-third of all human transcripts and are known regulators of various important cellular growth and differentiation factors. microRNAs recently emerged as key regulatory molecules in chronic liver disease. 25 Porphyrins Porphyrins are intermediates of the heme biosynthetic pathway.

Lipid digestion and absorption is more complicated than carbohydrate and protein digestion and absorption because of lipid solubility characteristics, and involves emulsification of lipids by bile salts, hydrolysis by pancreatic lipase and colipase, solubilization of fatty acids and monoglycerides into mixed micelles, absorption, reesterification, chylomicron formation, and transport into the intestinal lymphatics or portal capillaries. Chylomicrons containing short-and long-chain triglycerides, and the newly incorporated B-100 apoprotein, are preferentially absorbed into the intestinal lymphatics where they are transported into the cisterna chyli, thoracic duct, and systemic circulation where they acquire apolipoproteins C and E from circulating high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). Apolipoprotein (apo) C-II activates lipoprotein lipase in the capillary beds of adipose and skeletal muscle, where they are stored as is or hydrolyzed into free fatty acids, \u03b2-monoglyceride, and glycerol. The cholesterol-rich remaining particles (now referred to as chylomicron remnants), return apo C-II molecule to HDL and are recognized by specific hepatic apo E and apo B-100 receptors that rapidly remove them from the circulation by endocytosis.

VLDL apo C-II activates lipoprotein lipase located in the capillary beds, where once again triglyceride hydrolysis takes place with the production of free fatty acids and glycerol. The VLDL molecules remaining after hydrolysis of VLDL triglycerides are intestinal bacteria to produce the secondary bile acids, deoxycholic acid, and lithocholic acid. 2, 5, 28 Prior to secretion, bile acids are conjugated with taurine and/or glycine to form tauro-and glycoconjugated bile salts (see Figure 61 -3, C). Conjugation lowers the pK a to well below the physiologic range of biliary and intestinal pH, and conjugated bile acids become ionized anions (referred to as bile salts) rather than undissociated bile acids. In the ionized form, they are less likely to be absorbed by the small intestine and so maintain a higher intraluminal concentration appropriate for emulsification, digestion, and absorption of lipids. Dogs and cats conjugate primarily with taurine. Dogs can convert to glycine conjugation if taurine is deficient, but cats cannot. Cats are obligate taurine conjugators, and have an essential dietary taurine requirement. 2, 5, 28 Bile salts are amphipathic molecules with polar and nonpolar domains imparting two important functions. Bile salts have an initial detergent effect on fat particles in food permitting the breakup of fat globules into smaller sizes. This is the initial emulsification phase of bile salts that facilitates intraluminal lipid hydrolytic digestion. Bile salts further assist in the absorption of fatty acids, monoglycerides, cholesterol, and other lipids through the formation mixed micelles. These micelles serve to transfer digested lipids across the unstirred layer of the mucosa.",

Drug metabolism takes two general forms: phase I metabolism (modification reactions) and phase II metabolism (conjugation reactions). Phase I metabolism typically subjects a drug to oxidation or hydrolysis. It involves the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which facilitate reactions that include N-, O-, and S-dealkylation; aromatic, aliphatic, or N-hydroxylation; N-oxidation; sulfoxidation; deamination; and dehalogenation. Phase II metabolism conjugates the drug to hydrophilic substances, such as glucuronic acid, sulfate, glycine, or glutathione. Phase I metabolism usually precedes phase II metabolism, but this is not always the case. 34 The liver is an important site of drug toxicity and oxidative stress because of its proximity and relationship to the GI tract. Seventyfive percent to 80% of hepatic blood flow comes directly from the GI tract and spleen via the main portal vein. Portal blood flow transports nutrients, bacteria and bacterial antigens, drugs, and xenobiotic agents absorbed from the gut to the liver in a more concentrated form. Drug-metabolizing enzymes detoxify many xenobiotics but might activate the toxicity of others.

Organisms that cannot easily and quickly remove ammonia usually have to convert it to some other substance, like urea or uric acid, which are much less toxic. Insufficiency of the urea cycle occurs in from the GI tract must be tolerated. The liver favors the induction of tolerance rather than the induction of immunity. Although hepatocytes constitute the major cell population of the liver, direct interaction of hepatocytes with leukocytes in the blood is unlikely. Sinusoidal endothelial cells, which line the hepatic sinusoids and separate hepatocytes from leukocytes in the sinusoidal lumen, and Kupffer cells, the resident macrophage population of the liver, can directly interact with passenger leukocytes. In the liver, clearance of antigen from the blood occurs mainly by sinusoidal endothelial cells through very efficient receptor-mediated endocytosis. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells constitutively express all molecules necessary for antigen presentation (CD54, CD80, CD86, major histocompatibility complex [MHC] classes I and II, and CD40) and can function as antigen-presenting cells for CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. 40, 41 Thus, these cells probably contribute to hepatic immune surveillance by activation of effector T cells. Antigen-specific T-cell activation is influenced by the local microenvironment. This microenvironment is characterized by the physiologic presence of bacterial constituents such as endotoxin and by the local release of immunosuppressive mediators such as interleukin-10, prostaglandin E 2 , and transforming growth factor-\u03b2. 42 Regeneration Liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy is a very complex and well-orchestrated phenomenon. It appears to be carried out by the participation of all mature liver cell types. 43, 44 The process is associated with signaling cascades involving growth factors, cytokines, matrix remodeling, and several feedbacks of stimulation and inhibition of growth related signals. 45, 46 The liver manages to restore any lost mass and adjust its size to that of the organism, while at the same time providing full support for body homeostasis during the entire regenerative process. In situations when hepatocytes or biliary cells are blocked from regeneration, these cell types can function as facultative stem cells for each other.",

A structured interview process and understanding the basics of communication are important success factors to retrieve this crucial information. Fortunately, the knowledge about communication in the medical profession and the focus on the veterinary curriculum, has increased considerably during the last few years. 2, 3 Some basic principles should be kept in mind to understand the symptoms in dogs and cats with diseases affecting the hepatic parenchyma, portal vasculature, and the biliary system. First, for most of its functions, the liver has a tremendous (approximately 80%) reserve capacity and a remarkable potential to regenerate. 4 Symptoms occur only when progressive disease exhausts hepatic reserves. Diseases often remain subclinical for lengthy periods of time; symptoms may be relatively mild and nonspecific because the liver reserve prevents overt abnormalities. Symptoms such as lethargy, vomiting, or mild polyuria and polydipsia (PU/PD) may alert the clinician that a liver disorder could be developing. Serious symptoms may indicate loss of hepatic reserves. The onset of symptoms may be acute, but they may be the end result of a disease that has been present for many weeks or months. Because no specific physical abnormalities occur with most liver diseases, it is important to remember that liver disease may be present when symptoms of illness are unexplained or nonspecific. Sensitive and specific laboratory tests may easily detect such liver diseases. 5 Second, most liver diseases cause similar signs and symptoms (Table 61 -2). One of these is acholic feces, which occurs nearly exclusively in dogs with common bile duct obstruction. 6 Owners b Documented in humans, may occur in dogs and cats. a More likely to present with chronic rather than acute liver disease. the clinical signs listed in Table 61 -2 are candidates for having a primary hepatopathy. In all such cases, further diagnostic studies should be performed to confirm or exclude liver disease ( Figure  61 -5).",

Breed associations may occur when a disease is (in part) determined by genetic factors. Breeders may, by chance, increase the incidence of hepatic diseases by familial selection.

            "text": "Chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, both of which are, as a rule, different stages of one disease, occur more frequently in certain breeds. 15 Hepatitis may develop at any age, but typically not before 2 years of age. Only lobular dissecting hepatitis tends to occur at a young age (i.e., often before 1 year of age). 16 Breeds associated with hepatitis are Doberman Pinschers, Bedlington Terriers, West Highland White Terriers, American and English Cocker Spaniels, Labrador Retrievers, and many other breeds. Recent copper excretion studies have shown that hepatitis is caused by copper retention and not vice versa in Doberman Pinschers. 17 The cause of copper retention remains unclear; many of the tested candidate genes (including Murr 1, the affected gene in Bedlington Terriers) were excluded as monogenetic causes for copper-associated subclinical hepatitis in may note the light-gray appearance of stool, which in combination with icterus is virtually diagnostic for extrahepatic cholestasis. Different combinations of clinical signs and symptoms may occur with any liver disease. Statistically, one disease may be associated with a typical pattern of signs and symptoms in dogs and cats. However, overlapping patterns are so great that it is useless to try to identify the exact disease based on clinical signs and symptoms alone (Table . Clinical signs and symptoms associated with liver diseases of cats are similar to those in dogs, except for PU/PD, which is not clinically overt in most cats. Certain liver diseases cause neurobehavioral signs associated with hepatic encephalopathy, 7 and these signs may wax and wane in their frequency and severity. Any medication given may appear to be effective because of the natural fluctuation of signs. Therefore signs of hepatic origin may be easily missed. Seizures alone are never caused by hepatic encephalopathy; if they do occur, they occur in combination with other signs seen with this syndrome. 5 Furthermore, very few, if any, medications to treat liver diseases have been tested in double-blind, placebocontrolled studies, making decisions about the best therapeutic regimens difficult. 8 It is usually not possible to differentiate between hepatic diseases and diseases of other organs based on symptoms and clinical signs. Signs associated with hepatic diseases are nonspecific; similar signs may occur in diseases of many other organ systems, most notably the GI, neurologic, renal, and hematologic systems (see Table 61 -2). 9 Of the GI tract-related symptoms, nausea expressed as vomiting in acute cases or reduced, irregular appetite with occasional vomiting and weight loss over time, is very common in liver and biliary diseases of dogs and cats. For biliary diseases these are always the most prominent symptoms. Diarrhea, however, is not a major symptom of liver disease, and in cases in which diarrhea is the leading symptom the liver is only rarely the causative organ (except for rare cases with complete common bile duct obstruction). A rare sign (not included in Table 61 -2) is an ulcerative form of dermatosis, so-called superficial necrolytic dermatitis, hepatodermal, or hepatocutaneous syndrome. This syndrome occurs rarely in dogs with liver cirrhosis and nodular hyperplasia and whose pathogenesis is poorly understood. 10 This symptom and the more common symptoms of lethargy, inappetence, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, PU/PD, and neurobehavioral symptoms are frequently associated with diseases of other organs. Therefore the history often discloses symptoms that may suggest hepatic disease, but may also be caused by other disorders.",

            "text": "Two main reasons account for the nonspecificity of liver-related symptoms. First, the liver is the central organ for many metabolic and detoxifying pathways; consequently, failing liver function may cause dysfunction of other organs. One example is hepatic encephalopathy; metabolic dysfunctions of the liver cause neurotransmitter dysfunctions of the brain, resulting in neurobehavioral signs. 11 Second, toxic factors resulting from diseases of other organ systems (especially from the GI tract) often secondarily affect the liver. Examples include hepatic lipidosis in diabetes mellitus, steroidinduced hepatopathy in Cushing syndrome, reactive hepatitis in GI diseases, and centrolobular liver necrosis in acute, severe anemia. 5 Therefore signs and symptoms of liver disease may be hidden within signs of other organ dysfunction, and vice versa. Because clinical and physical examination findings may be compatible with hepatic disease, and because laboratory tests to detect hepatic disease are also abnormal with primary and secondary hepatopathies, it is often necessary to make a histologic diagnosis of the liver disorder to resolve this dilemma. 12, 13 Lack of specific physical examination findings may prevent recognition of a primary liver disease. Most dogs with illnesses causing pathetic innervation; therefore dilation (e.g., extrahepatic cholestasis), cholecystitis, or cholelithiasis should be suspected in vomiting dogs and cats. 5 Vomiting is also common in upper GI disease. In many GI diseases, translocation of bacteria and endotoxins may cause secondary, nonspecific, reactive hepatitis. 30 This occurs frequently in dogs, but rarely in cats. Reactive hepatitis is characterized by intrahepatic canalicular cholestasis, liver cell necrosis, and an exudative inflammatory reaction. Clinical signs, symptoms, and diagnostic results associated with primary liver disease and reactive hepatitis are similar; therefore, a further diagnostic workup is important to reveal the primary cause.",

            "text": "Small bowel-type diarrhea occurs frequently with hepatic diseases (see Table 61 -2). Two primary mechanisms may account for clinical signs. First, cholestatic diseases (intrahepatic or extrahepatic caused by common bile duct obstruction) disrupt the normal enterohepatic cycle of bile acids; therefore less bile reaches the duodenum. 30, 31 Decreased resorption of dietary fat may cause hyperosmotic intestinal contents and diarrhea. However, studies in rats show that cholestasis must be severe before steatorrhea as a result of disruption of the enterohepatic bile acid cycle occurs. Another mechanism for diarrhea in liver disease is increased resistance to portal blood flow, resulting in portal hypertension and congestion of splanchnic organs. Intestinal vasculature congestion reduces intestinal water resorption and increases intestinal volume content. This is the predominant mechanism underlying diarrhea in diseases such as chronic hepatitis, lobular dissecting hepatitis, portal vein thrombosis, and portal vein hypoplasia. 5 Alternatively, when the primary cause of diarrhea is intestinal disease, the liver may be affected secondarily. In those cases, the hepatic macrophage system should remove the increased absorption of (endo)toxins or bacteria by the affected intestinal wall. Increased exposure, however, can lead to secondary, nonspecific, reactive hepatitis. Endotoxins also effectively inhibit bile formation and flow, leading to cholestasis. It is therefore common to find increased plasma liver enzyme activities and bile acid levels in cases of reactive hepatitis; clinical icterus may even be apparent. The cause of diarrhea can be determined only by further diagnostic methods, including histologic evaluation of liver biopsy specimens. Reactive hepatitis resolves rapidly when the primary disease is treated successfully. In the authors' experience it is very rare to find diarrhea as single or the leading symptom in cases of liver disease. If present, it is usually one of the less prominent symptoms in the spectrum of other more prominent symptoms such as apathy, PU/PD, or vomiting. One may therefore elect to follow liver laboratory values after treatment of the intestinal disease and perform a liver biopsy if liver parameters fail to improve within a few weeks.",

Diseases associated with the latter form are chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, portal vein hypoplasia, lobular dissecting hepatitis, and portal vein thrombosis. 32 Cats, because of their dependence on some essential amino acids (e.g., arginine), may develop hepatic encephalopathy without portosystemic shunting, especially when they have a severe form of hepatic lipidosis. 33 Doberman Pinschers. 17 The hepatitis in Doberman Pinschers is sex linked, confined to females, and aggressive. 18 It is responsive to medication with penicillamine, 19 but may terminate in micronodular cirrhosis. This form of cirrhosis, predominantly seen in copper toxicosis, differs from other forms of chronic hepatitis, in which patients typically develop macronodular cirrhosis with large hyperplastic nodules. Hepatitis is overrepresented in female Doberman Pinschers by a factor of 10; a study in Finland showed that approximately 10% of Doberman Pinschers may be affected. 20 Inherited copper toxicosis is also a well described entity in Bedlington Terriers worldwide. 21 Both sexes may be affected. Clinical signs usually develop after 4 years of age as a result of the gradual accumulation of copper. It is caused by a defect in the Murr 1 gene, leading to a severely decreased excretion of copper by hepatocytes. Other affected breeds are West Highland White Terriers (particularly in the United States), Skye Terriers, Dalmatians, Anatolian Shepherd dogs, and Labrador Retrievers. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] Siamese cats may also be predisposed to copper-associated hepatopathies. 9 Although essential for life, copper is usually ingested to excess and must be eliminated by the liver to prevent toxicity. The central role of the liver in copper homeostasis makes it vulnerable if elimination processes fail. 27 Furthermore, increased copper levels add to the oxidative stress, which is an important component in chronic inflammatory and cholestatic diseases in dogs. 25 Spaniels seem to have the form of chronic hepatitis unrelated to copper toxicosis and develop macronodular cirrhosis when left untreated. No sex predisposition exists, but there seems to be a worldwide overrepresentation of hepatitis in this breed.",

Vomiting may be caused by direct stimulation of the vomiting center via the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the fourth ventricle by (endo)toxins that are not cleared by the liver. 30 This typically occurs when toxins from the GI system bypass the liver and access other body systems. Vomiting is common in all conditions that share portosystemic shunting and liver dysfunction (e.g., congenital shunts and acquired shunts because of hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and portal vein hypoplasia or thrombosis). Hepatic diseases that cause an abnormal liver shape may reposition the upper GI tract and induce nausea and vomiting by vagal stimulation. Causes include hepatic tumors, especially liver cell (or hepatocellular) carcinomas, and unilateral collapse and contralateral hypertrophy, which may occur with thrombosis of a main branch of the portal vein. The gallbladder and larger bile ducts have a rich sym-form ammonium urate. Affected dogs usually have clinical signs related to shunting and liver dysfunction, such as hepatic encephalopathy, PU/PD, or vomiting. In the other category, the enzyme uricase, which forms allantoin, is inactive because of an inborn error affecting only this function. Ammonium urate urolithiasis occurs commonly in Dalmatians but may occur in other breeds. 43 Affected dogs only have signs related to urolithiasis (e.g., pollakiuria, stranguria, dysuria).",

The latter disease is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfonamide-containing drugs. The smaller bile ductules become necrotic and liver lobuli may be disconnected from the biliary tract. Affected dogs have a history of recent medication with sulfonamides. Acholic feces contain excess fat because resorption is impaired. The lack of normal black-brown fecal pigments occurs because their precursor, bilirubin, does not reach the duodenum. Therefore, the feces from affected animals are gray-white and soft. Animals with this condition often are icteric. The presence of icterus reduces the likelihood of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency as a diagnosis.",

This occurs especially in dog and cats with portosystemic shunting, either congenital or acquired. In addition to reduced hepatic clearance, anesthetics exert their action via various neurotransmitter systems in the brain, which may already be functioning abnormally as a consequence of hepatic encephalopathy. 34 This is especially true of drugs that act via the GABA-benzodiazepine pathway.

PU/PD is most common in diseases associated with congenital or acquired portosystemic shunting and, therefore, with hepatic encephalopathy. In affected dogs, abnormal neurotransmitter disturbances lead to increased secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior and intermediate pituitary lobes. 37 Chronically elevated ACTH stimulates increased levels of free cortisol. Increased levels of free cortisol, in turn, affect the posterior lobe of the pituitary creating an increased threshold for the release of arginine vasopressin. 38, 39 Thus, a higher plasma osmolality is required to stimulate antidiuresis through arginine vasopressin, and before reaching that threshold, affected dogs become thirsty and start drinking. 38 PU/PD is not only present in cases with hepatic encephalopathy, but also frequently in all other liver diseases. This may be caused by certain bile acids, which are often increased in plasma of animals with liver diseases. Bile acids may inhibit the activity of 11\u03b2-hydroxyl steroid dehydrogenase. 40 This enzyme protects the aldosterone receptor from occupation by cortisol, by converting cortisol into cortisone, which cannot bind to the receptor. Present in plasma in tenfold excess compared with aldosterone, cortisol can occupy and stimulate the aldosterone receptor thereby inducing pseudohyperaldosteronism and PU. 41 Reduced hepatic formation of urea is another possible but undocumented mechanism that may play a role in the pathogenesis of PU/ PD. In urea deficiency states, the kidney does not have sufficient urea available to build up an osmotic gradient in the medulla. Apart from this mechanism, PD also occurs in liver diseases not associated with hepatic encephalopathy (e.g., extrahepatic cholestasis and liver tumors). The mechanism is unclear; however, nausea with an impulse to drink and compensation of water loss by vomiting and diarrhea may play a role. 5",

However, only approximately 20% of dogs with hepatobiliary diseases and 30% to 40% of cats are icteric. Icterus results from bilirubin accumulation in the blood and extravascular space as a result of increased production, reduced clearance, impaired conjugation by the liver, and/or impaired bile flow. In most cases, a combination of these factors is involved. Cholestasis is predominant; therefore conjugated bilirubin is the fraction present in greatest quantity. Hemolysis alone does not result in icterus with normal liver function. When hemolysis is severe, however, it may result in such a degree of portal hypoxia that the centrolobular zones of the liver lobules become necrotic. In those cases, icterus results from the combination of increased production and reduced liver function and cholestasis. 45 If hemolysis is the primary cause of icterus, it must be severe, and the mucous membranes will be extremely pale. Primary liver diseases that may cause icterus are commonly accompanied by hemolysis. Whereas the erythrocyte lifetime is reduced to 6 to 10 days in dogs with severe primary hemolytic disease; it is 20 to 60 days (normally 100 days) in hepatobiliary disease. Increased production of bilirubin and liver dysfunction with cholestasis result in a combined conjugated and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in dogs and cats with primary hepatic or hemolytic disease. 46 Icterus caused by hemolytic disease is characterized by pale mucous membranes, whereas the mucous membranes in animals with primary liver disease are normal or only slightly pale. The combined evaluation of icterus and the color of the mucous membranes immediately reveal the nature of the underlying process.",

Increased fragility of red cell membranes may be a result of the high bile acid levels in most liver diseases, whereas a reduced clearance of enteral endotoxins and bacteria by the liver may also induce immune-mediated hemolysis. Apart from hemolysis, nonregenerative anemia also may occur as part of the syndrome of anemia of chronic disease as an expression of catabolism and slight deficiencies of iron and B vitamins.

This is especially true when the injury is acute. Conversely, in cases of chronic end-stage liver disease, such as cirrhosis, serum hepatic enzyme activities may not be markedly increased, or may even be within the reference interval as a result of the replacement of hepatocytes with fibrous tissue. Consequently, serial evaluation of serum hepatic enzyme activities is more useful for assessing prognosis than measurement at a single point in time.

The mean serum half-life of ALT was reported as being 149 minutes in one study 1 and 59 hours in another. 2 The serum half-life of ALT is generally believed to be shorter in the cat than in the dog. A mean serum half-life of 207 minutes was reported in an experiment involving three healthy cats. 3 The shorter half-life in cats means that increases in serum ALT activity are considered more clinically important in this species. As ALT is metabolized in the liver its serum half-life may be longer in patients with liver disease. 4 Increased cell membrane permeability in the absence of hepatocyte destruction can cause a rapid increase in serum ALT activity. Because of this, ALT activity is a considered to be a highly sensitive marker of hepatocyte injury. This also means that an increased ALT activity does not imply severe or irreversible hepatocellular injury. The highest increases in ALT activity are seen during acute hepatic inflammation or necrosis, but because of the capacity for the liver to regenerate these do not indicate irreversible damage. Consequently, a single measurement of ALT activity does not provide an accurate prognosis. However, the degree of the ALT activity increase is believed to have some correlation with the number of hepatocytes that have been injured. Cholestasis can also result in an increased serum ALT activity because of hepatocellular damage caused by the accumulation of bile acids. Certain drugs can lead to increases in serum ALT activity. These are usually minor, for example, phenobarbital used at therapeutic doses frequently leads to small increases in serum ALT activity, in the absence of hepatic insufficiency. These increases are thought to occur as a result of subclinical hepatic injury rather than induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes. 5 Toxic doses production of clotting factors, some degree of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and severe protein deficiency. 13, 52 It should be noted that taking a fine-needle aspiration biopsy should be considered safe, even if abnormalities in coagulation are present.

Despite the apparent clarity of these aims, hepatobiliary disease can present a diagnostic challenge for a number of reasons. First, as clinical signs can be nonspecific, hepatobiliary disease should be a consideration when evaluating any patient with signs of systemic disease. Dogs and cats with hepatobiliary disease may not have any clinical signs. Furthermore, because of the liver's central role in metabolism and detoxification of endogenous toxins and xenobiotic agents, a number of extrahepatic diseases can secondarily affect the liver. It is important to distinguish these secondary hepatopathies from diseases that originate in the liver (primary hepatopathies). Additionally, serum markers of hepatocellular damage, cholestasis, and hepatic function can be abnormal in the absence of hepatobiliary disease. Finally, the liver's large reserve capacity means that detectable loss of liver function often occurs late in the course of disease. Thus, when assessing a patient with suspected hepatobiliary disease, it is important to consider the clinical presentation, results of laboratory testing, diagnostic imaging findings, and the results of cytologic and/or histopathologic evaluation together.",

The relative importance of these extrahepatic isoenzymes varies, but their extrahepatic release can lead to increased serum activities. Also, the production of some hepatic enzymes can be induced by certain ALP (B-ALP), and kidney ALP (K-ALP) are transcribed from the tissue nonspecific ALP gene. The other gene encodes intestinal ALP (I-ALP) and probably glucocorticoid-induced ALP (G-ALP). 13 In dogs the serum half-lives of placental ALP, K-ALP, and I-ALP are less than 6 minutes. 14 In cats the serum half-life of I-ALP is less than 2 minutes. The half-lives of placental ALP and K-ALP are also assumed to be short in the cat as they have similar structures to I-ALP. Because of this, only L-ALP, B-ALP, and, in the dog but not the cat, G-ALP, are believed to contribute significantly to serum ALP activity. The serum half-life of L-ALP is approximately 70 hours in the dog 14, 15 and 6 hours in the cat. 16 L-ALP is bound to the membranes of the hepatocytes by glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkages. Cleavage of these links by glycosylphosphatidylinositol-phospholipase allows the enzyme to be released into the bloodstream. 17 As bile acids have detergent-like properties; accumulation of bile acids during cholestasis facilitates this process. Cholestasis can also result in the induction of synthesis of L-ALP (and G-ALP in the dog). Consequently, serum ALP activity is often severely increased in patients with cholestatic disorders. In the dog, ALP is considered to be a sensitive marker for cholestasis with a sensitivity of 85%. 18 The short half-life of L-ALP in cats means that increases in ALP during cholestasis are not as high as in the dog. Consequently, ALP is a less-sensitive marker of cholestasis in the cat than in the dog, with a reported sensitivity of only 48%. 19 However, the shorter half-life in cats and the absence of G-ALP means that any increase in ALP activity should be considered clinically important in this species. An increased serum ALP activity does not differentiate between intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholestasis. A wide variety of liver diseases can cause intrahepatic cholestasis. This is generally caused by hepatocyte swelling, causing obstruction of the small bile canaliculi. The increase of ALP following a hepatic insult is delayed compared to rises in markers of hepatocellular leakage. The reason for this is that it takes time for the enzyme to be synthesized and released into the systemic circulation. ALP often remains increased for some time after the resolution of liver injury.",

            "text": "B-ALP is released into the bloodstream as a result of the activity of osteoblasts. Therefore any condition that results in increased bone formation can lead to increased serum ALP activity. In animals that are skeletally immature, mild increases in serum ALP activity are commonly observed. Animals with increased osteoblast activity, such as those with hyperparathyroidism, neoplasia involving bones, and osteomyelitis, may have mild to moderate increases in ALP activity. These causes of increased B-ALP activity are unlikely to be confused with primary liver disease because the increases are smaller than would be expected with cholestasis, and because bone diseases are often clinically apparent. Finally, an increased serum activity of B-ALP was reported in a family of asymptomatic Huskies. 20 In dogs, but not in cats, G-ALP and tissue-nonspecific ALP may be induced by corticosteroids. G-ALP is believed to be an isoform of I-ALP with a prolonged serum half-life that is produced by the liver. 13 Posttranslational glycosylation of the G-ALP is believed to be responsible the prolonged half-life. Induction of G-ALP may cause an increase in total serum ALP activity after administration of exogenous corticosteroids. Synthesis of this isoenzyme can also be induced by the administration of anticonvulsant drugs, such as phenobarbital. Similarly, hypercortisolemia frequently causes an increased serum ALP activity because of induction of G-ALP. However, in dogs with excess serum concentrations of endogenous or exogenous corticosteroids, hepatocyte swelling caused by glycogen accumulation (vacuolar hepatopathy) may lead to intrahepatic cholestasis, another potential contributor to increased serum ALP of phenobarbital can cause dramatic increases of serum ALT activity and hepatic insufficiency. Prednisone and other glucocorticoids can cause an induction of ALT (and steroid hepatopathy) and consequently small increases in serum ALT activity. Serum ALT activity can also be increased with any secondary hepatopathy. However, a persistently increased serum ALT activity, even with an apparently normal liver function, is an indication for further diagnostic testing.",

Muscle disease can cause an increase in serum AST activity. Because of this, AST is considered less liver specific than ALT.

In contrast, the mitochondrial fraction is only released during hepatocellular necrosis. Release of AST from hepatocytes into the serum parallels the release of ALT. Therefore, like serum ALT activity, serum AST activity is considered a sensitive marker for hepatocyte injury. It has been suggested that increased AST activity may be more sensitive than increased ALT activity for the detection of hepatocellular injury in cats. 9 Corticosteroids and phenobarbital may cause mild increases in serum AST activity.

Differences among these isoforms arise because of differing posttranslational processing. Liver ALP (L-ALP), bone Globulins are produced in the liver, but not exclusively so. The liver produces \u03b1-globulins and \u03b2-globulins, whereas lymphoid cells produce immunoglobulins (\u03b3-globulins). Hepatic insufficiency rarely leads to a decrease in serum globulin concentration. Conversely, inflammatory liver disease may be associated with hyperglobulinemia because the nonimmunoglobulin fraction produced by the liver includes several acute-phase proteins (C-reactive protein, haptoglobin, and serum amyloid A). The hepatic synthesis of these proteins is increased during systemic inflammation [26] [27] [28] [29] possibly leading to a rise in the total serum globulin concentration.

However, the differential diagnoses for severe hypoalbuminemia (<2 g/dL) are limited to hepatic insufficiency, severe exudative skin disease, protein-losing enteropathy, and proteinlosing nephropathy. It is possible to determine the cause of severe hypoalbuminemia from a combination of clinical findings, measurement of the serum globulin concentration, urinalysis (including protein creatinine ratio), tests of GI protein loss, and tests of liver function. As albumin contributes significantly to colloid oncotic pressure, 24 severe hypoalbuminemia can lead to ascites, pleural effusion, and/or subcutaneous edema. The liver has a large reserve capacity for the synthesis of albumin and albumin has a serum halflife of approximately 7 days in dogs. 25 Consequently, hypoalbuminemia is a relatively insensitive marker for hepatic insufficiency and is only likely to be seen in patients with advanced chronic liver disease or portosystemic shunts (PSSs).",

This is because when portosystemic shunting occurs, the ammonia absorbed from the intestines bypasses the liver and reaches the systemic circulation directly. The sensitivity of plasma ammonia measurement for the detection of PSS is reported to be between 81% and 100% in dogs [38] [39] [40] [41] and 83% in cats. 41 The measurement of postprandial venous ammonia is more sensitive than the measurement of fasting ammonia (sensitivities of 91% and 81%, respectively) for the detection of congenital PSS. 42 However, the sensitivity for detecting dogs with hepatocellular disease is only 36%.

These are secreted in the bile, and then stored in the gallbladder. Cholecystokinin is released from endocrine cells in the small intestine. This hormone stimulates gallbladder contraction and the flow of bile into the duodenum. When the gallbladder contracts the bile acids are released into the intestines. Spontaneous gallbladder contraction also occurs during the interdigestive phase. 63 Bile acids act as ionic detergents, aiding the emulsification of dietary lipids and their subsequent intestinal absorption in micelles. 64 Bile acids are recycled in a process known as enterohepatic circulation ( Figure 61-6 ). Primary bile acids are lipid insoluble and thus are only absorbed from the intestines when they bind to specific high affinity ileal mucosal receptors. 64 This ileal reabsorption is very efficient. The reabsorbed bile acids enter the portal circulation and upon reaching the liver they are efficiently extracted from the plasma and subsequently reexcreted. The total bile acids pool can be recirculated several times in a day. Consequently, the rate of hepatic bile acid synthesis and the fasting serum bile acids concentration in dogs and cats with normal hepatic function is low. Because of the increased release of stored bile acids during the postprandial period, small increases in total SBA concentration occur in animals with normal hepatic function.",

These are readily absorbed from the colon by passive diffusion. First-pass extraction and reexcretion of secondary bile acids is less efficient than that for primary bile acids. Consequently, secondary (unconjugated) bile acids are often present in postprandial serum samples. 65 Hepatobiliary disease can cause increased SBA concentrations by interfering with hepatocellular function, by causing decreased bile flow (cholestasis), or by altering the hepatoportal blood flow. The main clinical use of SBA measurement is to assess hepatic function in patients suspected to have hepatic disease, with serum exposed to air the urobilinogen remaining in the intestines is altered and oxidized into the brown pigment sterocobilin. 23 Prehepatic hyperbilirubinemia is caused by increased production of bilirubin as a result of hemolysis. The liver has a large reserve capacity for bilirubin excretion so, for hemolysis to cause hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic bilirubin clearance must be decreased. 55 This occurs if the hemolytic anemia results in hepatocyte dysfunction because of hypoxia. If hepatic hypoxia occurs serum hepatic enzymes activities are often increased. Prehepatic hyperbilirubinemia is mainly distinguished from other causes of hyperbilirubinemia by the presence of severe anemia. Other supportive evidence includes the presence of a regenerative erythroid response, characteristic changes in red blood cell morphology, and possibly the detection of red blood cell bound antibodies. 56 Hepatic hyperbilirubinemia is caused by a decreased rate of hepatocyte bilirubin uptake, conjugation, or excretion (as a result of intrahepatic cholestasis). Usually, hepatocyte dysfunction and intrahepatic cholestasis occur concurrently. Hepatic enzyme activities (both hepatocellular leakage markers and cholestatic markers) are often increased, although they can also be increased with both prehepatic and posthepatic hyperbilirubinemia. Because of the hepatic reserve capacity, hepatic disease must be severe in order to cause hyperbilirubinemia. A range of primary and secondary hepatopathies can cause hepatic hyperbilirubinemia. Hepatic hyperbilirubinemia can usually be distinguished from prehepatic hyperbilirubinemia by assessment of the patient's hematocrit, and from posthepatic hyperbilirubinemia by abdominal ultrasound. Other markers of hepatic insufficiency, when present, provide additional support for the presence of hepatic hyperbilirubinemia.",

Typically, extrahepatic bile duct obstruction leads to dramatic increases in serum cholestatic enzyme activities (compared to hepatocellular leakage enzyme activities) and hypercholesterolemia. When the bile duct is completely obstructed, acholic (pale-colored) feces may be noted. Rupture of the biliary tract frequently leads to hyperbilirubinemia as bilirubin accumulates in the abdomen.",

This is of clinical importance because it means hyperbilirubinemia (and icterus) may persist for several weeks after the resolution of its cause. 57 Bile acids (or bile salts when they are deionized) are formed from cholesterol in the liver and are the major constituent of bile. Serum bile acids (SBAs) measurement is a useful test of liver function in dogs and cats. SBAs are either measured as a fasting sample (after withholding food for 12 hours) or by collecting paired fasting and 2-hour postprandial samples. 58 Both of these tests are simple to perform and safe. Enzymatic measurement of the concentration of total bile acids in serum has become widely available and has replaced other techniques such as radioimmunoassays. 59, 60 Once collected, the samples of serum can be stored at room temperature, making it possible to send them to an outside laboratory for evaluation. Lipemia and hemolysis of the blood samples should be avoided as both can interfere with the assay. Increased SBA concentrations recent study did not support the use of a 13 C-labeled galactose breath test for assessment of liver function in dogs. 80 The metabolism of endogenous substances has been investigated to find possible markers of hepatic cellular metabolism. Dogs with hepatic disease (hepatitis and neoplasia) had significantly higher serum L-phenylalanine concentrations than did healthy dogs and those with nonhepatic diseases. 81 Further investigations are needed to determine the utility of these tests for assessing liver function in veterinary patients.",

Radiography and abdominal ultrasound are the most frequently used imaging modalities for assessment of the hepatobiliary system in dogs and cats, but alternative imaging techniques are now being used more frequently.",

Generalized hepatomegaly can be caused by a number of conditions including neoplasia, vacuolar hepatopathies, congestion, or amyloidosis. Focal hepatomegaly can be caused by neoplasia, abscesses, granulomas, or a liver lobe torsion. Radiographic signs associated with hepatomegaly are rounded hepatic borders, caudal displacement of the gastric axis, and extension of the hepatic silhouette beyond the costal arch. Radiography does not allow appreciation of mild hepatomegaly. Additionally, it can be normal for the hepatic silhouette to extend beyond the costal arch in brachycephalic breeds, chondrodystrophic breeds, neonatal animals, or geriatric animals. 91 The liver is normally appreciated as an area of homogenous softtissue opacity on radiographs. Radiolucent areas within the liver indicate accumulation of gas within the hepatic parenchyma, biliary tract, or portal vasculature. Gas in the parenchyma of the liver can be associated with an hepatic abscess. 92 Gas in or around the gallbladder has been reported in dogs with emphysematous cholecystitis. 93 Although uncommon in dogs and cats, if choleliths or choledocholiths contain enough calcium, they may be appreciated as mineral opacities within the hepatic silhouette. 94 Mineralization of the gallbladder wall can be associated with a biliary adenocarcinoma in the dog. 95 Parenchymal mineralization can be associated with granulomas, abscesses, 96 hematomas, neoplasia, or hepatic necrosis. 91 Angiography allows the visualization of the hepatoportal vasculature, including abnormal vessels. This often provides a definitive diagnosis of PSS and is indicated in patients that are suspected of having a PSS, where the shunt cannot be adequately evaluated by abdominal ultrasound. Anatomical characterization of congenital PSS is important when planning attenuation, and angiographic procedures often allow this. There are several techniques for mesenteric portography. Operative mesenteric portography is commonly performed immediately prior to surgical attenuation of a congenital PSS and involves catheterization of a mesenteric vein and injection of a contrast agent. Operative contrast portography allows evaluation of the portal vasculature before and after shunt attenuation. This technique has the disadvantage of being relatively invasive. Cranial mesenteric portography can be accomplished less invasively by using ultrasound guidance to percutaneously catheterize the splenic vein. 97 However, this can be technically demanding and may not be possible in smaller patients. Transvenous retrograde portography has been described and involves the catheterization of the jugular vein. 98 This technique allows selective catheterization of the shunting vessel and measurement of portal pressures (Figure 61-7) . Transvenous retrograde portography has been applied during percutaneous transjugular coil embolization of intrahepatic shunts. 99 Percutaneous splenoportography involves percutaneous injection of contrast media into the spleen. This technique is simple to perform, but there is a risk of complications such as splenic infarction or hemorrhage.",

            "text": "Abdominal ultrasonography is the most commonly used imaging modality for evaluating small animal patients with suspected hepatobiliary disease. Ultrasonography allows assessment of the hepatic parenchyma and biliary tract. Evidence of extrahepatic disease causing a secondary hepatopathy may also be detected. Additionally, ultrasound guidance is often used when collecting samples for cytologic and histologic evaluation of the liver. Gallbladder mucoceles can also lead to biliary obstruction, which might also be appreciated sonographically. The sensitivity of ultrasound for the detection of a gallbladder wall rupture in dogs with gallbladder mucoceles is reported to be 85.7%. 109 Abdominal ultrasound can be used to assess the liver for vascular disease. Congenital PSS is classified as being intrahepatic or extrahepatic. Although angiographic techniques are considered to be the gold standard for the detection and characterization of PSS, abdominal ultrasound is being used increasingly for this purpose. Sonographic assessment of the portal vasculature is time-consuming and highly operator dependent. Because of this there should be a high index of suspicion for PSS before performing these studies. Secondary findings consistent with PSS include mild bilateral renomegaly, urolithiasis (because of urate crystalluria), and microhepatia. Ascites and hepatic parenchymal changes are not consistent with congenital PSS. Extrahepatic shunts typically occur in small-breed dogs and arise from the splenic vein or the right gastric vein while intrahepatic shunts typically occur in larger breeds of dogs and arise from the right or left portal branch. An intrahepatic PSS is usually easier to detect sonographically than an extrahepatic PSS in dogs. Cats typically have single extrahepatic shunts with a wider degree of anatomical variation than in the dog. Ultrasonography has been reported to have a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 98% for detecting PSS in dogs. 110 Portal hypertension can develop as a result of chronic hepatitis with fibrosis, hepatic arterioportal fistulas, portal vein thrombosis, primary portal vein hypoplasia, extraluminal compression of the portal vein, or after ligation of a congenital PSS. The finding of hepatofugal or reduced velocity hepatopetal blood flow using Doppler ultrasound is consistent with portal hypertension. 111 However, not all patients with portal hypertension will have these changes. Ascites frequently, but not always, develops secondary to portal hypertension and this can be readily detected on abdominal ultrasound examination. Acquired portosystemic collaterals (also known as acquired PSS) may develop when sustained prehepatic or hepatic portal hypertension is present. 112 Sonography may allow detection of portal hypertension and APSCAPSC although APSC vessels are more difficult to identify than congenital PSS. Posthepatic portal hypertension does not result in the development of may not affect the echogenicity of the liver at all. Neoplasia can also lead to the appearance of nodules within the hepatic parenchyma. Malignant liver nodules have a variable appearance and size and can be difficult to distinguish from nonmalignant conditions such as cysts, hematomas, benign hyperplastic nodules, granulomas, or abscesses. The finding of one or more target lesions in the liver or spleen had a positive predictive value of 74% for detecting malignancy, and thus should not be considered a specific finding. 103 Cytologic or histologic evaluation of a tissue sample is needed to differentiate between malignant and benign liver nodules. Tumors, such as hepatoma or hepatocellular carcinoma, can also focally infiltrate the liver.",

            "text": "The term cholangitis refers to a group of nonobstructive biliary diseases, which are more common in cats than in dogs. Typical ultrasound findings in cats include a hypoechoic hepatic parenchyma and prominent portal vasculature. 105 Additional findings can include evidence of pancreatic inflammation, thickening of the gallbladder wall, and dilation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary system. It is important to note these changes are not always present. Cytologic or histologic confirmation and bacterial culture are needed to confirm this diagnosis. Generalized gallbladder wall thickening can occur as a result of cholecystitis, cholangitis, or hepatitis. However, the gallbladder wall can also appear to be thickened when peritoneal effusion or hypoproteinemia are present. Gall bladder wall masses can be identified sonographically as a focal thickening of the gallbladder wall. Sonography has also been used to assess gallbladder motility in dogs. 106 It should be noted that gravity dependent gallbladder sludge can be found in dogs without hepatobiliary disease, so this finding should be considered incidental. 107 Abdominal ultrasound is the most commonly used imaging modality for the detection of biliary obstruction in dogs and cats. Findings consistent with biliary obstruction include common bile duct distention, intra-and extrahepatic bile duct distention, and/or gallbladder dilation. A retrospective study showed that common bile duct dilation greater than 4 mm was 97% sensitive for the detection of biliary obstruction in cats. 108 Sonography can also aid in identifying the cause of biliary obstruction. Biliary obstruction can be classified as being luminal or extraluminal. Extraluminal causes include nonneoplastic pancreatic disease, abdominal adhesions, and, rarely, pancreatic neoplasia. Luminal causes include gallbladder mucocele, biliary neoplasia, inflammation, and cholecystolithiasis. Biliary tract obstruction can progress to biliary rupture and bile peritonitis. Sonographic signs of biliary rupture include loss of gallbladder wall continuity, free peritoneal fluid, and signs of localized peritonitis. Gallbladder mucoceles occur in the dog, but have not been described in cats. Mucoceles have a variable sonographic appearance; typical findings include a stellate or finely striated bile pattern with a hypoechoic rim, which is not gravity dependent, and GB LT specificity of 100%. 119 The disadvantages of CT and MRI include their limited availability, cost, and the need for anesthesia.",

Transsplenic portal scintigraphy is preferred over perrectal portal scintigraphy as it is simpler to perform, uses lower doses of the radiopharmaceutical, and is more sensitive (Figure 61-9 ).

This can lead to the formation of a pure transudate as the result of a reduced plasma colloid oncotic pressure. Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure because of portal hypertension may lead to formation of a pure or modified transudate. Hepatic neoplasia can also lead to a formation of a modified transudate. Biliary tract rupture can lead to bile peritonitis and abdominal effusion. An exudate with a bilirubin concentration greater than twice that of the plasma is suggestive of bile peritonitis. 120 Cytologic evaluation of hepatic FNA can aid in making a diagnosis of liver disease. Suppurative, mixed inflammatory, lymphocytic and, more rarely, eosinophilic patterns of inflammation can be appreciated cytologically. Each pattern of inflammation suggests a group of possible diagnoses. The finding of dark green or black bile casts suggests cholestasis. Infectious diseases such as histoplasmosis can be definitively diagnosed based on the cytologic finding of the infectious agent ( Figure 61-11 ). Hepatocellular vacuolation can be classified as being caused by lipid or not. Lipid vacuolation of hepatocytes is characterized by colorless cytoplasmic vacuoles. Severe lipid vacuolation is suggestive of hepatic lipidosis in cats ( Figure  61 -12). However, feline hepatic lipidosis often occurs secondary to another disease process. A group of cats with cytologic findings suggestive of hepatic lipidosis were reported to have underlying infiltrative liver disease. 121 Nonlipid vacuolation is characterized by generalized hepatocyte swelling and lacy vacuolation ( Figure 61-13 ). Vacuolar hepatopathy occurs secondary to a wide variety of extrahepatic disease processes in dogs. 122 Metastatic tumors and round cell tumors, such as lymphoma ( Figure 61-14) , affecting the liver can often be diagnosed cytologically. Additionally, cytologic evaluation can aid in distinguishing liver nodules because of extramedullary hematopoiesis from those caused by neoplasia. However, it is not possible to distinguish hepatic nodular hyperplasia from hepatic adenoma or well-differentiated carcinoma cytologically. Some cases of hepatocellular carcinoma can be diagnosed cytologically if criteria for malignancy are present. and cats suspected to have cholangitis. 124 The finding of neutrophils and bacteria on bile cytology supports a diagnosis of feline neutrophilic cholangitis. Cytology is essential for the diagnosis of this disease, as cats with neutrophilic cholangitis may not have typical hepatic histopathologic changes and it can be difficult to distinguish these cats from those with lymphocytic cholangitis. Bile should also be submitted for aerobic and anaerobic bacteriologic culture.",

Laparotomy allows collection of relatively large wedge biopsies, with direct visualization. This technique does not require specialized equipment or training, and excessive bleeding can be readily identified. However, laparotomy requires general anesthesia and is the most invasive biopsy technique. Percutaneous needle biopsy techniques have been described. These techniques may be possible under heavy sedation and are the leastinvasive method for collecting liver biopsies. Ultrasound guidance is often used, allowing biopsy of focal lesions. It is also possible to biopsy tissue that is deeper within the hepatic parenchyma than is possible with other techniques. However, the specimens that are collected are relatively small and may be inadequate for accurate assessment in some patients. A prospective study showed that there was agreement between the histomorphologic diagnoses made upon examination of needle biopsies and those made on wedge biopsies collected during laparotomy or necropsy for only 48% of dogs and cats. 125 Excessive hemorrhage after biopsy may not be identified immediately. Laparoscopy allows collection of biopsies using forceps with laparoscopic guidance. This technique requires general anesthesia, but is less invasive than laparotomy. The biopsies collected are larger than needle biopsies and excessive bleeding can be visualized. However, laparoscopy requires specialized equipment and training. The use of biopsy forceps may result in crushing artifact and the tissue collected may be too superficial to identify lesions that lie deeper within the hepatic parenchyma. 126 Regardless of the technique used, a tiny proportion of the organ is sampled and, because liver disease can affect the hepatic parenchyma in a heterogeneous manner, sampling error is possible.

Consequently the clinician must take into account the clinical question, the appropriate invasive biopsy method, and methods of managing postbiopsy complications. Postbiopsy hemorrhage is often the first concern, although it is unclear as to what the best predictor of hemorrhage is in patients about to undergo hepatic sampling. In one study of 200 human patients in which bleeding was evaluated laparoscopically, there was no correlation between any in vitro coagulation test and \"liver bleeding time.\" 3 Other studies in man have used laparoscopy and ultrasonography to assess hepatic bleeding time following needle biopsy, and most have shown similar poor correlation between coagulopathies and hepatic bleeding times. Similar studies have not been reported in veterinary medicine. There also have been studies in human and veterinary medicine evaluating risk factors for bleeding complications (as opposed to \"hepatic bleeding times\"). 4,5 Bigge et al. correlated coagulation profile findings and bleeding complications after ultrasound-guided biopsies in 310 dogs and 124 cats. 5 There was no apparent correlation between coagulation parameters and major complications following liver biopsy. Studies show that clotting times assessing proteins induced by vitamin K antagonism are more sensitive in detecting coagulopathies in patients with hepatic disease. 6, 7 The measured of these metals and quantification is essential for the diagnosis of hepatic copper retention. These measurements are usually performed on freeze-dried pieces of liver. Specimens for metal measurement should not be stored in saline and should be kept in metal-free containers. Recently, it was shown that measurements of the concentration of copper and iron, but not zinc, can be ascertained from deparaffinized-archived liver tissue. 127",

Recent advances in imaging technology, the use of multiple imaging modalities, and newer biopsy methods have resulted in improvement in the ability to safely procure hepatic tissue for evaluation.

Likewise, the liver can continue normal anabolic or catabolic function despite severe hepatocyte leakage of intracellular enzymes because of its marked reserve capacity.

The sample size often limits the number of available cells to obtain an accurate diagnosis, and hemodilution makes it difficult to assess whether inflammatory cells were present in the liver or peripheral blood. There are several important elements used to interpret pathologic information including lobular architecture, presence and location of inflammation within a lobule, presence and severity of fibrosis, metal accumulation, vascular abnormalities, and lobule heterogeneity. These criteria cannot be accurately determined using a cytologic sample obtained using FNA. Several studies have compared fine-needle aspiration cytology with biopsy with histopathology. [9] [10] [11] [12] In one study with a total of 34 cases, there was good correlation in 35% of cases, partial correlation in 35% of cases, and no correlation in 30% of cases. 9 Poor correlation was found with a variety of histologic changes, including vacuolar change, lipidosis, cholestasis, inflammation, and neoplasia. In a similar study with 97 cases, complete agreement between fineneedle aspiration and histopathology was seen in only 30% of cases in dogs: 25% agreement with inflammation, 14% agreement with neoplasia (mainly carcinoma), and 64% agreement with vacuolar hepatopathy. 10 In cats, there was overall agreement in 51% of cases: 27% agreement with inflammation, 33% agreement with neoplasia (lymphoma), and 64% agreement with vacuolar hepatopathy. Although vacuolar hepatopathy was the most sensitive diagnosis, it was also the most common misdiagnosis using cytology. In another study, the best correlation between hepatic cytology and biopsy was seen with lipidosis, lymphoma, and carcinoma, whereas the worst performance was seen with inflammatory and fibrotic disorders. 11 Another study found high sensitivity and specificity with fine-needle aspiration in detecting inflammatory hepatic disease in dogs. 12 However, further information was not provided such as the severity of the inflammation or other histopathologic features. Additionally, for noninflammatory hepatic disease, cytology was inaccurate in 76% of cases. proteins-induced-by-vitamin-K-antagonism test is more than twice as sensitive in dogs and more than three times as sensitive in cats in detecting coagulopathies compared with prothrombin time (PT) and aPTT. 6, 7 However, in a pilot study performed by me, hepatic bleeding times assessed via laparoscopy did not correlate with proteins induced by vitamin K antagonism times. Thus it appears that indices of coagulation in the peripheral blood are generally unreliable guides of the risk of bleeding after liver biopsy, and hence, are of limited value in determining contraindications to this procedure. This lack of correlation may be explained by the high concentration of clotting factors in the hepatic parenchyma and by mechanical compression of the needle tract by the elastic tissue within the liver. In most cases of significant hemorrhage, technical errors such as damaging a large vessel are the cause rather than persistent oozing from a needle biopsy site. Controlled studies in veterinary patients will be necessary to make final conclusions regarding postbiopsy hemorrhage in the patient with a coagulopathy.",

            "text": "Fine-needle aspiration involves obtaining a small amount of hepatic tissue for cytologic analysis, and is typically performed in conjunction with, and guided by, ultrasound. Ultrasound imaging helps determine if there is a diffuse abnormality (e.g., increased or decreased echogenicity, diffuse mottling) or if there are focal abnormalities (e.g., discrete nodules, cysts, masses, or focal areas of heterogenous mottling). An appropriate site to be sampled is chosen. Often multiple sites are chosen to represent different lobes, and in the case of focal lesions, to sample more than one area of abnormal tissue and sample seemingly normal tissue. The sites are also chosen based on accessibility. For example, a solitary nodule in the dorsocranial aspect of the liver in a large deep-chested dog would be impossible to reach with a 1.5-inch needle. A lesion adjacent to the gallbladder or caudal vena cava would involve considerable risk. The clinician would need to decide whether the relative risk of sampling such lesions is the appropriate decision, or whether other methods of sampling would be more appropriate such as laparoscopy or laparotomy. Figure 61 -15 depicts a typical setup for fine-needle aspiration. Usually a 22-gauge, 1.5-inch needle is used. For most patients, the procedure is performed without sedation or local anesthetic. If it is determined that the animal is moving too much during the initial ultrasound examination, a sedative may be necessary (or an anesthetic in extreme cases). The needle is inserted without a syringe using ultrasound guidance. The needle is rapidly agitated in and out (sometimes referred to as mimicking the action of a sewing machine) and simultaneously twisted multiple times for a few seconds to obtain a sample. This method relies on capillary action rather than suction to get tissue into the needle, resulting in less hemodilution. After removing the needle from the liver, a syringe is attached and cells are expelled onto a glass slide for cytologic examination. Often three to five separate attempts are made to increase the sample size and diversity. examination is performed prior to biopsy. This allows planning of the procedure based on echo pattern, lesion size, proximity to other organs, proximity to blood vessels, determination of cystic or solid tissue, and optimal approach of the needle path. Care must be taken prior to taking samples to ensure that vessels and other organs are not within the path of the needle. For diffuse lesions, the transducer is typically placed caudal and to the left of the xiphoid, and aimed at the left medial or lateral lobes. In patients with a small liver, it may be difficult to adequately visualize the needle without gastric gas interference. Placing these animals in a 45-degree right lateral oblique position can reduce this interference. If the animal is under general anesthesia, an assistant can compress a rebreathing bag to hold the animal in deep inspiration, which serves to move the diaphragm and liver caudally to improve visualization. The area is surgically prepared. The ultrasound transducer is covered with sterile wrap and sterile lubricant is used to enhance skin contact. A small stab incision is made in the skin at the desired needle insertion site. While one hand maneuvers the transducer, the other hand advances the needle into the liver under direct ultrasound visualization. The image should be optimized to maximize the chance of recognizing the needle within the liver. To allow distinction of the needle from other echogenic structures, the needle can be gently moved in and out with minimal movements (attempting to move the liver within the abdominal cavity rather than the needle within the liver). Occasionally the needle cannot be seen, and indirect evidence of organ penetration must be used such as movement of the liver or visualization of movement at the liver border. The needle is then directed so the trajectory will avoid other structures when it is fired. The needle is then fired, and immediately removed. For most cases, four to five samples are obtained, and are submitted for aerobic/anaerobic culture, histopathologic evaluation, and metal (copper, zinc, and iron) quantification. In one study, liver tissues with high metal concentrations had significantly lower copper and iron in needle-core versus wedge biopsy specimens. 13 Consequently the value of needle-core biopsy specimens for measurement of metal concentrations is questionable. Careful examination for post-biopsy hemorrhage is then performed. External digital pressure may be used to help control hemorrhage in smaller patients. Usually an abdominal compression wrap is ineffective for controlling hemorrhage.",

Completely automated needles thrust the inner obturator (containing the biopsy tray or specimen notch) followed by the outer cutting sheath into the liver in a fraction of a second. These needles can be operated with one hand while the other hand operates an ultrasound transducer to allow precise placement of the biopsy instrument. There is minimal displacement of the liver, a shorter intraparenchymal phase, and a more reliable yield of tissue. This allows a smaller diameter needle to be used and a lighter degree of sedation in some cases. Using the rapid cutting action, the hepatic tissue tends to be less fragmented. Semiautomated needles require manual placement of the internal obturator into the liver, followed by an automatic thrusting of the outer cutting sheath by a spring-loaded mechanism.

However, acute liver disease can also be associated with other pathologic processes such as severe hepatic lipidosis (cats), granulomatous hepatitis (fungal infections), intrahepatic cholestasis (bacterial cholangitis, leptospirosis), and malignant infiltration (lymphoma, malignant histiocytosis). Canine adenovirus I, canine and feline herpesvirus in the neonate, Clostridium piliforme, and Toxoplasma gondii are specific examples of infectious agents that cause acute hepatic necrosis (with variable inflammation), often as part of a multisystemic disorder. 2 Although leptospirosis is a well-recognized infectious cause of acute liver disease in dogs, hepatic necrosis is an uncommon histologic feature and hepatic lesions are typically characterized by cholestasis, liver cell dissociation, and nonspecific reactive hepatitis. 3 Despite the large number of potential causes of acute hepatitis and necrosis, a specific etiology is often not determined. 4, 5 In a recent case series of 101 dogs with primary hepatitis (acute and chronic hepatitis) that were presented to a referral clinic, 21 dogs were diagnosed with morphologic features of acute hepatitis. 4 A cause could not be determined in the majority of these cases, although increased hepatic copper was detected in five dogs with acute hepatitis, suggesting that copper accumulation could be a significant contributing factor. 4",

The transfixation method entails placing a ligature through the liver lobe approximately 8 to 10 mm from its edge. The ligature is tightened to crush through the hepatic parenchyma along one border of the desired biopsy specimen. An additional throw is made at a right angle to the first ligature, and this throw is tightened to crush the parenchyma of the second border of the specimen.

If the desired area does not lie near the edge of a liver lobe, a 6-mm biopsy punch can be used. The biopsy punch should be inserted into the hepatic parenchyma ensuring not to penetrate the opposite surface. If the biopsy site is close to the hilus, extra caution must be used so that no more than half of the thickness of the liver is penetrated. The biopsy sample is removed from the liver using scissors. Hemorrhage can be controlled by filling the defect with a topical hemostatic agent (Gel Foam) and applying digital pressure for 3 to 5 minutes, or by suturing the hepatic capsule with fine, absorbable monofilament suture in a cruciate pattern.

Acute inflammation may be the primary event, or necrosis of hepatocytes can be followed by a substantial inflammatory response, the \"hallmark\" of necrotic cell death. 1 The term acute hepatitis traditionally has been used when infectious agents cause hepatocellular necrosis, even though in the early stages, hepatic inflammation can be minimal or absent. 2 Controversy exists among veterinary pathologists regarding the preferred terminology (acute hepatitis versus acute hepatic necrosis), when necrosis predominates and is caused by noninfectious insults such as toxins or ischemia. 2 For the purposes of this discussion, lesions of acute hepatitis and acute hepatic necrosis are discussed together, recognizing that the primary contributions of each lesion may be variable, depending on the cause, host response, and passage of time. Acute hepatitis, a form of primary hepatitis, should be differentiated from \"nonspecific reactive hepatitis,\" a response of the liver to a variety of extrahepatic disorders that is characterized by focal inflammation without necrosis. 2 Nonspecific reactive hepatitis is discussed in a later section of this chapter. synthesis. 7 Increased activity of the cholestatic liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and GGT, also commonly occur with acute hepatitis and necrosis, but the magnitude of the increase is much less than for the ALT and AST.",

When liver injury is mild (focal necrosis and inflammation), clinical signs may be absent, mild, or related to an underlying cause in another organ system. In this setting, hepatic involvement may not be recognized until biochemical evaluation reveals increased liver enzyme activity or mild hyperbilirubinemia. It has been suggested that many dogs with acute hepatitis are not recognized clinically, because signs are mild and self-limiting, and dogs recover spontaneously regardless of treatment. 6 Clinical signs of acute hepatitis include acute onset of lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, PU, and PD, in a previously healthy animal. These are nonspecific findings of acute liver disease, which overlap those of other systemic disorders.

However, liver failure that is recently recognized may not necessarily be recent in onset. With occult chronic liver disease, clinical signs may be vague and go unrecognized by the owner until a final phase of hepatic decompensation. The owner should be questioned about any subtle signs of chronic illness that would suggest the underlying liver disease may be chronic rather than acute, and that the current illness may be an exacerbation or decompensation of chronic liver disease. Dogs and cats with ALF are generally in good nutritional status compared with those with chronic hepatic disease. Findings of cachexia, emaciation, ascites, or edema suggest a more protracted illness and are characteristic of chronic rather than acute liver disease. It is important to make a distinction between acute and chronic liver disease as the intensive supportive care indicated in ALF might not be warranted in chronic end-stage liver disease. The long-term prognosis is better for acute hepatitis than chronic hepatitis. 4",

ALT and AST activities are moderately to markedly increased, because of enzyme leakage from damaged hepatocytes. 7 Although ALT activity increases with many hepatic diseases, the largest magnitude of increase is seen with acute hepatic necrosis and roughly correlates with the number of involved cells. 7 ALT activity may be increased as much as 100 times the upper range of normal, with increases in AST activity that parallel but are generally lower (30 times the upper limit of normal) than the ALT. It should be noted that some recognized hepatotoxins (aflatoxin and microcystin in blue-green algae) are not associated with severe or protracted increases in ALT activity because of toxin-suppressed transaminase improvement over a 2-to 3-week period.

In most cases specific therapy is unavailable and treatment is directed at more general supportive and symptomatic treatment of liver disease. Glucocorticoid therapy is not typically indicated in the treatment of acute hepatitis. 4 Empirical treatment with antioxidants such as S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe; 20 mg/ kg PO q24h), milk thistle (Siliphos; 3 to 6 mg/kg PO q24h), or vitamin E (10 to 15 IU/kg q24h) may be warranted, as oxidative stress is believed to play a role in drug (carprofen, potentiated sulfonamides, diazepam, methimazole, lomustine, others), and toxin (aflatoxin, organic solvents, and heavy metal toxicity) induced hepatic injury. 9 SAMe and milk thistle have additional cytoprotective properties that could be beneficial in necroinflammatory hepatopathies and hepatotoxicity. Antioxidants and cytoprotective agents are discussed in more detail in Chapters 40 and 46, respectively. Liver biochemistries should be monitored to assess patient response to therapy. Repeat liver biopsy performed 6 to 8 weeks after the initial diagnosis has been recommended, to confirm that acute hepatitis has improved or resolved, or to document a progression toward chronic hepatitis. 4, 6 It has been suggested that most dogs with mild idiopathic acute hepatitis (not in ALF) recover after several days, regardless of treatment. 6 For patients with ALF, aggressive supportive treatment is required. Goals of therapy are to treat the underlying cause when possible, allow adequate time for hepatic regeneration and repair, and prevent or control complications of liver failure, such as hypoglycemia, coagulopathy and anemia, HE, GI ulcers, and septicemia. Intravenous N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a glutathione source/ antioxidant, is the antidote of choice for treatment of acetaminophen toxicity. NAC also appears to have additional potential benefits (improved systemic hemodynamics and tissue oxygen delivery), and should be considered for use in any dog or cat with ALF. 9 The optimal dose regimen when NAC is used for this purpose has not been determined.

            "text": "Treatment of hepatic abscesses consists of surgical resection or drainage of focal lesions, administration of appropriate antibiotics, correction of associated fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base imbalances, and identification and treatment of any underlying disease process. Treatment of large unifocal hepatic abscesses has typically involved surgical resection of affected tissue, which may necessitate partial or full lobectomy. 10, 12 If perforation and peritonitis are present, surgical abdominal drainage and lavage are indicated. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage of a solitary abscess may resolve the abscess or allow stabilization until surgical resection can be performed. 11 The successful management of focal hepatic abscesses (up to 8 cm in diameter) by ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage and alcoholization has been described in five dogs and one cat. 13 Broad-spectrum combination antibiotic therapy (directed toward both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria) should be initiated as soon as cultures have been obtained. Results of a Gram stain on the exudate may provide preliminary information as to type of organism and guide the empirical choice of potentially effective antibiotics. Recommendations for broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage of hepatobiliary infections include either a fluoroquinolone combined with amoxicillin/clavulanate or a fluoroquinolone combined with penicillin and metronidazole, until culture results are available. The dose of metronidazole should be adjusted in animals with hepatic dysfunction (7.5 mg/kg PO q8-12h). Antibiotic therapy should be continued for at least 6 to 8 weeks. Response to treatment can be monitored with serial ultrasound examinations and repeated blood work.",

Female dogs appear to be at increased risk in some studies, 4,40 while others report that male and female dogs are equally affected. 41, 42 Within particular breeds, sex differences have been noted (female Doberman Pinschers, Labrador Retrievers, and English Springer Spaniels; male Cocker Spaniels). 26, 29, 36, 38, 39 Dogs diagnosed with chronic hepatitis are generally 4 to 7 years of age, but adult dogs of any age (or breed) can be affected. 4, 29, 41 Etiology and Pathogenesis Ideally, canine chronic hepatitis should be classified on an etiologic basis. However, with the exception of copper-associated liver disease in Bedlington Terriers, the cause, pathogenesis, natural history, optimal treatment, and prognosis of these disorders are unknown (Table 61 -5) . Idiopathic chronic hepatitis is the most common clinical diagnosis. 4, 32, 40, 41 Infectious Causes. Viral infections are a common cause of chronic hepatitis in humans, but are not currently recognized as an important etiology in dogs. In humans, viruses have the potential heartworm test; see Table 61 -4), systemic eosinophilia, and hypersensitivity reactions. If no specific cause can be determined, empirical treatment with fenbendazole should be considered, followed by corticosteroid therapy as described for idiopathic chronic hepatitis.",

Neutrophils predominate with acute extrahepatic disorders, whereas mononuclear inflammation occurs with chronic extrahepatic disorders or residual hepatic inflammation. The liver may be secondarily affected by systemic disorders because of changes in liver blood flow, portal blood delivery of bacteria, drugs, hormones, cytokines, or other substances from the GI tract, or activation of intrahepatic Kupffer cells (monocyte-macrophage system) involved in the hepatic immune response.

            "text": "Canine leptospirosis is typically associated with acute cholestatic hepatic disease and acute renal failure. However, persistent infection can cause chronic hepatitis in the absence of azotemia. 50, 51 Leptospira serovar grippotyphosa was incriminated as a cause of chronic hepatitis in a kennel of American Foxhounds, based on serologic evidence and demonstration of spirochetes in the liver. 50 Leptospira serogroup australis (serovars australis, bratislava, and muenchen) infection was suspected to cause chronic hepatitis in 16 young Beagle dogs in a breeding colony routinely vaccinated against leptospirosis serogroups canicola and icterohaemorrhagica. 51 Canine leishmaniasis has been associated with histologic evidence of chronic hepatitis, 52 but clinical features suggestive of hepatic involvement (hepatomegaly, ascites, or icterus) were absent. Histologic findings revealed granulomatous hepatitis in most dogs, but some dogs had marked portal infiltration with lymphocytes and plasma cells, and mild portal fibrosis. Leishmania amastigotes were routinely identified in macrophages in liver or other affected tissues. Bartonella clarridgeiae DNA was amplified from a liver biopsy of a Doberman Pinscher with copper-associated chronic hepatitis, although the significance of this finding is unclear. 53 Copper Accumulation. Copper is an essential trace element in diets and is required for a number of physiologically important enzymes. Cells have highly specialized and complex systems for maintaining intracellular copper concentrations. At toxic concentrations, free intracellular copper initiates oxidative damage causing hepatocellular necrosis and inflammation. 54, 55 Normal copper metabolism has been reviewed in detail elsewhere. 54, 56 Copper accumulation in the liver can be associated with significant hepatic injury resulting in acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, and cirrhosis ( Figure 61-18) . 4, 54, 57 It is one of the few well-documented causes of canine chronic hepatitis. In one study, copper-associated A B liver of 37 dogs but was not identified in any control samples from healthy livers. None of the dogs had decreased serum levels of \u03b1 1antitrypsin. Positive \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin staining was a more consistent finding in English and American Cocker Spaniels with chronic liver disease, than in other breeds. The authors concluded that accumulation of \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin might play a role, but it could not be determined if it was the cause or a result of chronic liver disease. 31 Drugs and Toxins. Drug or toxin exposure is a potential cause of canine chronic hepatic disease. Drugs that have been incriminated include anticonvulsants (phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoin), oxibendazole-diethylcarbamazine, lomustine, and possibly carprofen. [70] [71] [72] [73] Chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis from long-term phenobarbital therapy is most widely recognized. 70, 71 Exposure to aflatoxin from contaminated commercial dog food is usually associated with ALF, but low-level long-term exposure in dogs can result in chronic hepatic injury (biliary hyperplasia, fibrosis, nodular regeneration). A breeding colony of German Shepherd dogs developed chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis that was suspected (but never confirmed) to be a result of exposure to a porphyrinogenic substance, based on the finding of aggregates of crystalline pigments with orange birefringence with polarized light. 74 Early recognition of drug-or toxin-induced chronic hepatic injury requires biochemical monitoring of liver enzymes, as dogs are clinically asymptomatic in the early stages.",

            "text": "Autoimmune/Immune Mechanisms. Autoimmune hepatitis has not been documented in dogs. However, some dogs with chronic hepatitis appear to respond to corticosteroid therapy and thus may correspond to autoimmune hepatitis in humans. 41 Autoimmune hepatitis in humans is a progressive chronic hepatitis of unknown cause that is believed to occur when an environmental agent (viruses, medications) triggers a cascade of T-cell-mediated events directed at liver antigens, in a genetically predisposed individual. 43 Women are more commonly affected than men. Hyperglobulinemia is a common finding. An infectious cause is difficult to document, as exposure may have occurred many years prior to the overt autoimmune disease. 43 Certain drugs may induce or unmask an autoimmune hepatitis, or simply cause hepatocellular injury that mimics autoimmune hepatitis. 43 An autoimmune component to Doberman Pinscher hepatitis has been speculated, because of the breed's predisposition, high female predominance, and the finding that expression of MHC class II antigens on hepatocytes of affected dogs correlates with degree of inflammation and decreases after treatment with prednisolone. 75 Dogs with chronic hepatitis may have concurrent disorders associated with immune aberrations (immune hemolytic anemia, hypothyroidism, atopy, glomerulonephritis), but whether this is coincidental or indicative of the presence of multiple immune disorders as seen with autoimmune hepatitis in humans is unknown. 37, 76, 77 Autoimmune hepatitis in humans is diagnosed when other causes of acute or chronic hepatitis have been excluded and serum autoantibodies (antinuclear, antismooth muscle, antibody to liver/ kidney microsomes type 1, antibody to liver cytosol type 1) are detected. 43 A number of studies have evaluated the role of liverassociated antibodies and cell-mediated response in dogs with chronic hepatitis, but none answers the question of whether the immune response is the primary cause of the hepatitis or a secondary phenomenon. Twenty-four dogs with chronic hepatitis were evaluated for circulating autoantibodies (against cell nuclei, smooth muscle, liver membrane, and mitochondria) by indirect immunofluorescence. 77 Antibodies to cell nuclei and liver membranes were the early stages, copper is sequestered in hepatic lysosomes and hepatic damage is minimal. However, with progressive accumulation of copper, hepatic injury becomes significant. The average copper concentration in Bedlington Terriers with chronic hepatitis is approximately 6000 \u00b5g/g dry weight and values up to 12,000 \u00b5g/g dry weight have been reported. 23, 57 Inherited copper-associated liver disease is also described in the West Highland White Terrier, Skye Terrier, Doberman Pinscher, Dalmatian, and Labrador Retriever, but with the possible exception of Dalmatians, the hepatic copper levels are much lower than in Bedlington Terriers. [25] [26] [27] 34, 35, 38 The pathogenesis of copper accumulation and the relationship to chronic liver disease in these breeds is poorly understood. It seems likely that these breeds have a hereditary disorder of copper handling, but it is unlikely to be the same as described for the Bedlington Terrier.",

            "text": "Hepatic copper accumulation in the liver may also be a consequence rather than the cause of chronic hepatitis. Because copper is normally excreted in the bile, chronic cholestasis and impaired bile flow can result in secondary copper accumulation. 57, 66 Secondary copper accumulation is predominantly periportal and is usually less than 2000 \u00b5g/g dry weight. 57, 66 The effect of cholestasis on hepatic copper content was evaluated in three groups of dogs: Bedlington Terriers with copper toxicity, dogs with extrahepatic biliary obstruction (the prototype example of a cholestatic disorder) and chronic hepatitis in breeds not known to be at risk for copper-associated liver disease. 66 Hepatic copper content was evaluated by a semiquantitative method based on copper staining of liver tissue with rubeanic acid, using a scale of 0 (no copper) to 5. 67 Copper staining revealed absent to mild increases (scores of 0 to 2+) in dogs with biliary obstruction and chronic hepatitis when compared with Bedlington Terriers (scores of 5+). It was concluded that copper scores of 3+ or higher were suggestive of a primary copper storage disease. 66 Unfortunately, quantitative copper analysis was not evaluated. Markers of oxidative injury and altered defense mechanisms were similar in the three groups, consistent with the concept that copper, inflammation, and cholestasis can all contribute to oxidative injury. 66 High dietary copper intake appears to be an unlikely explanation for hepatic copper accumulation and liver disease in dogs. 56 However, the copper content of commercial dog foods ranges from 12 to 16 mg/kg dry matter, which is relatively high compared with recommended minimum daily copper requirements in dogs. 56 There is speculation that the recent increase in pathologically elevated hepatic copper concentrations (specifically evaluated in Labrador Retrievers), may coincide with a pet food industry recommendation to replace cupric/cuprous oxide in feed formulations because of its low bioavailability. 68 Many dogs with copper-associated chronic hepatitis also have increased hepatic iron concentrations. 69 Hepatic iron accumulation usually correlates with degree of inflammation. 40, 69 Whether iron, as an oxidant, interacts with copper to contribute to lesions seen in copper-associated hepatitis remains to be determined. \u03b1 1 -Antitrypsin Deficiency. Inherited \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin deficiency is a well-recognized cause of chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis in humans, and may play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis in some dogs. 31 \u03b1 1 -Antitrypsin is a circulating protease inhibitor that is synthesized and secreted by the liver. \u03b1 1 -Antitrypsin deficiency in affected humans results in defective formation and impaired hepatic secretion of \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin, resulting in hepatic accumulation of \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin and hepatic injury. Serum levels of \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin are typically low. In a study of 57 dogs with chronic liver disease, \u03b1 1antitrypsin was detected by immunohistochemical staining in the early stages of chronic hepatitis, ultrasonography of the liver may be normal or reveal nonspecific changes in echogenicity. When chronic hepatitis has advanced to cirrhosis, potential ultrasonographic findings include microhepatia, irregular hepatic margins, focal lesions representing regenerative nodules, increased parenchymal echogenicity associated with increased fibrous tissue, and ascites. Splenomegaly and acquired PSSs may also be detected.",

Wedge biopsies are preferred over needle biopsies because they provide more tissue and are more likely to represent pathologic process(es) in the liver. When cirrhosis is present, laparotomy or laparoscopy often provide a better appreciation for the gross nodularity of the liver than can be ascertained from blind percutaneous needle biopsy (Figure 61-19 ). Chronic hepatitis is characterized histologically by moderate to severe inflammation (usually combinations of lymphocytes and plasma cells) associated with piecemeal necrosis. Piecemeal necrosis, also referred to as interface hepatitis, is necrosis involving the layer of hepatocytes adjacent to the portal tract or \"limiting plate.\" 2 The term bridging necrosis is used when necrosis and inflammation dissect across the hepatic lobule from portal areas to central veins or to adjacent hepatic lobules and suggests a severe form of chronic hepatitis. 2 Histopathologic evaluation of the liver should not only consider etiology, but the pathologist should also comment on the activity (amount of inflammation, extent of apoptosis and necrosis) and the stage of disease (extent and pattern of fibrosis; architectural distortion suggestive of cirrhosis). 2 Biopsies from dogs with chronic hepatitis should routinely be evaluated for copper accumulation. On hematoxylin and eosin staining, excess copper appears as golden brown refractile granules. 28 Histochemical stains, such as rhodanine or rubeanic acid, can be used to semiquantitatively evaluate for copper in the liver (see Figure 61 -19) . These stains consistently detect copper when amounts exceed 400 \u00b5g/g dry weight. 60 Values obtained by quantitative copper analysis have a strong correlation with the number and size of granules seen with histochemical stains within the range of 400 to 1000 \u00b5g/g of liver tissue. 60 Zonal distribution of copper detected, but were also found in dogs with other types of hepatic disease, suggesting a nonspecific secondary response. Patterns of circulating autoantibodies found in dogs differed significantly from those found in humans with chronic liver disease. 77 In another study, serum anti-liver-membrane-protein antibody-positive dogs (1 : 40 to >1 : 1600) had higher ALT activity, total bilirubin concentration, and more severe hepatic lesions than did anti-liver-membraneprotein antibody-negative dogs, but it was not determined whether autoantibodies were primary or secondary. 78 CD3+ lymphocytes are the most common hepatic lymphoid cells in dogs with chronic hepatitis and are associated with hepatic necrosis, 79-81 but also account for 54% of hepatic lymphocytes in normal dogs. 82 ",

Increased serum ALT activity, reflecting ongoing hepatic injury, is reported in 75% to 95% of dogs with chronic hepatitis. 4,7 Serum ALT activity may exceed 10 times the upper normal limit. 7 Periods of normal ALT activity may reflect cyclic disease activity and the varying severity of necrosis. 7 Serum ALP activity is also commonly increased, but the magnitude of the increase is generally lower than seen with ALT activity. When chronic hepatitis advances to cirrhosis, liver enzyme activity may be normal, indicating decreased viable parenchymal mass. 7 Abnormalities in biochemical tests such as hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia, decreased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), hypoglycemia, and increased SBA indicate hepatic dysfunction and a more advanced stage of disease. 32 Hyperglobulinemia can be seen in dogs with cirrhosis, but it remains to be determined whether this corresponds with increased autoantibodies as occurs in humans with autoimmune hepatitis, or whether it reflects nonspecific systemic antibody production in response to antigens from the portal blood which bypass the liver through acquired PSSs. 83 Mild nonregenerative anemia may be a reflection of chronic disease. Regenerative anemia can occur from blood loss secondary to a coagulopathy or bleeding GI ulcers. Copper-associated hemolytic anemia has only been documented in Bedlington Terriers. Abnormal hemostatic parameters (prolonged aPTT and PT) are indicative of severe hepatic dysfunction or DIC. A prolonged PT and thrombocytopenia may be negative prognostic indicators. 16, 37 Analysis of ascitic fluid reveals a transudate or modified transudate. 32, 42 Abdominal radiographs are unremarkable except when advanced stages of disease are accompanied by microhepatia or ascites.

Complications of corticosteroid therapy include GI bleeding (which may precipitate HE), secondary infections, iatrogenic Cushing disease, and worsening of ascites.

A mean decrease in copper of approximately 1500 \u00b5g/g was achieved in Bedlington Terriers treated for 6 months. 86 Dogs with secondary copper accumulation appear to respond more rapidly, possibly because hepatic copper content is lower in these breeds. 86 Doberman Pinschers with subclinical hepatitis treated with penicillamine for 4 months had a mean decrease in copper from 1036 \u00b5g/g to 407 \u00b5g/g. 87 Penicillamine has additional effects beyond copper chelation, which may be beneficial in dogs with chronic hepatitis, including inhibition of collagen deposition, stimulation of collagenase activity, immunosuppression, and immunomodulation. 54 Common side effects of penicillamine therapy include anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, which can be minimized by giving the medication with a small amount of food. The copper chelator, trientine (10 to 15 mg/kg PO q12h), is also effective for reducing hepatic copper concentrations. 86 It has fewer side effects than penicillamine and is effective in dogs with hemolytic anemia caused by copper release from necrotic hepatocytes. Iatrogenic copper deficiency (microcytosis and hepatic dysfunction) has been described in a dog treated with long-term copper chelation therapy (trientine) and a copper-restricted diet. 88 Decisions on duration of chelator therapy are based on followup liver biopsies with periodic monitoring of quantitative hepatic copper content.",

Zinc supplementation is typically used in conjunction with dietary copper restriction. Zinc decreases intestinal copper absorption by inducing the intestinal copper-binding protein, metallothionein, within intestinal epithelial cells, which preferentially binds dietary copper and prevents its absorption. Zinc acetate is given at a dose of 100 mg PO BID for 2 to 3 months, then at a maintenance dose of 50 mg PO BID. 89 A minimum of 3 months of zinc therapy is required before copper uptake from the intestinal tract is blocked. 89 accumulation should be noted, as copper accumulation starting in the centrilobular area is more likely with a primary metabolic defect in copper metabolism. 54 Copper granules can also be detected on cytology of hepatic aspirates or impression smears stained with rhodanine or rubeanic acid. Quantitative analysis for copper, by atomic absorption analysis on fresh hepatic tissue, is the definitive method to document increased hepatic copper content. Needle core biopsy specimens may not be reliable for metal analysis, as copper and iron values are consistently lower in needle core versus wedge biopsy samples. 84 Formalin-fixed tissues should be avoided, because formalin may contain copper or leach copper from the tissue. 57 Hepatic copper can be reliably determined retrospectively on deparaffinizedarchived liver biopsy specimens. 84 Once chronic hepatitis has been confirmed, a careful consideration of known causes of chronic hepatitis is essential (see Table  61 -5) . Findings that would support a primary metabolic defect in copper metabolism include a previously recognized breed predisposition, copper accumulation that precedes cholestasis or inflammation, centrilobular (zone 3) distribution of copper, histochemical score for copper of 3+ or greater, or quantitative copper measurements that exceed 2000 \u00b5g/g dry weight. 54, 57, 66 Special stains of the liver should be requested to evaluate for infectious agents such as leptospirosis; serum antibody titers for leptospirosis may be indicated. A history of chronic drug therapy should be sought, especially long-term anticonvulsant therapy or other drugs listed in Table 61 -5.",

            "text": "Affected dogs can be asymptomatic (in the early stages) or show signs of acute hepatic necrosis, chronic hepatitis, or cirrhosis. 54 In young dogs, copper accumulates in centrilobular (zone 3) hepatocytes and is sequestered in hepatic lysosomes. During this first stage, copper concentrations are between 400 and 1500 \u00b5g/g, dogs are asymptomatic, biochemical testing is within normal limits, and liver biopsy findings are unremarkable. In the second stage, when hepatic copper concentrations are between 1500 and 2000 \u00b5g/g, copper granules are also found in midzonal (zone 2) and periportal (zone 1) hepatocytes. Although dogs are still asymptomatic, focal hepatic inflammation (centrilobular mixed cell foci, with necrotic hepatocytes, lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, and copper-laden macrophages) is seen on biopsy, and increased serum ALT activity reflects hepatocellular injury. In the most advanced stage, when hepatic copper concentration exceeds 2000 \u00b5g/g, morphologic changes reveal chronic hepatitis that may progress to cirrhosis, and clinical and biochemical evidence of liver disease become apparent. Clinical signs include anorexia, lethargy vomiting, and weight loss. With progression to cirrhosis, findings of jaundice, ascites, and HE may develop. Biochemical findings vary with the stage of disease. Increased serum ALT activity is the most sensitive laboratory indicator, although findings will be normal in young dogs in stage I, because of the lack of hepatic inflammation. Other serum biochemical abnormalities typical of chronic hepatic dysfunction eventually develop. In some cases, acute hepatic necrosis and ALF occur. Hepatocellular necrosis may be associated with release of copper from necrotic hepatocytes, resulting in hemolytic anemia. During episodes of hemolysis, plasma copper levels are increased; other findings include low packed cell volume, hemoglobinemia, and hemoglobinuria. Liver biopsy and quantitative analysis of hepatic copper concentrations is required for definitive diagnosis and staging of the disease. Serum copper or ceruloplasmin concentrations are not helpful to make a diagnosis. 57 Liver biopsies should be performed in all Bedlington Terriers considered for breeding, in order to identify and remove affected dogs from breeding programs. Screening of asymptomatic dogs with a liver biopsy at 6 months and 15 months of age can determine if an affected dog is homozygous or heterozygous (a carrier). 15 Affected dogs (both homozygous and heterozygous) typically have increased hepatic copper by 6 months of age. However, copper concentrations in dogs who are carriers (heterozygous) return to normal by 1 year of age, whereas copper concentrations in homozygous dogs continues to increase. 57 Selective breeding programs in the Netherlands has decreased the prevalence of Bedlington Terrier copper-associated liver disease from 46% (1976) (1977) (1978) (1979) (1980) (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) (1985) (1986) to 11% (1990-1997) . 92 DNA testing of Bedlington Terriers is available from VetGen (www.vetgen.com). This assay evaluates a linkage-based DNA marker (CO4107, allele 2) that is located in the chromosome close to the gene for copper toxicity. 93 The test can identify normal, affected, and carrier dogs with 90% accuracy. However, the marker can only be relied on for diagnosis of the genetic status of an individual dog when supported by a pedigree study. 93, 94 Significant discrepancies were reported in 22 Bedlington Terriers, when comparing results of liver biopsy and the DNA marker. 94 This may be attributed to different subpopulations of Bedlington Terriers with variations in the disease-causing mutation of the COMMD1 gene or a second mutant copper gene could play a role. 94 Liver biopsy for quantitative Zinc administration should be separated from meals by at least 1 hour and should theoretically not be prescribed at the same time as a copper chelator. 54 Serum zinc concentrations should be monitored to achieve a level of 200 to 400 \u00b5g/dL. Zinc concentrations greater than 500 \u00b5g/dL may be toxic (hemolytic anemia).",

            "text": "Bedlington Terriers develop chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis from copper toxicity, as a consequence of an inherited metabolic defect resulting in impaired biliary copper excretion. 23, 57, 76 The disorder is transmitted by autosomal recessive inheritance. The gene responsible for this metabolic disorder is COMMD1, which is different than that described for copper toxicity (Wilson disease) in humans, in which the gene involved is ATP7B. 64 There is no gender predilection. At one time, it was speculated that as many as 60% of the breed might be affected. 57 Hepatic copper concentration in normal Bedlington Terriers ranges from 91 to 358 \u00b5g/g with a mean of 206 \u00b1 56 \u00b5g/g dry weight. 23 Bedlington Terrier copper-associated liver disease is associated with progressive, hepatic copper accumulation (copper levels of up to 12,000 \u00b5g/g) unless treatment is instituted. The lowest hepatic concentrations of copper are found in the youngest dogs and concentrations increase with age, peaking at around 6 years. Copper content usually declines thereafter in affected dogs, but not to normal. This decline may be a result of replacement of copper-containing hepatocytes by fibrous tissue or regenerative nodules that do not contain copper. The severity of hepatic disease Recent efforts have focused on identification of affected Doberman Pinschers prior to advanced hepatic disease. In Finland, a survey of 626 randomly selected, clinically healthy Doberman Pinschers, revealed that 8.8% of dogs had increased ALT activity, and 3.4% had hepatitis (parenchymal and portal mononuclear inflammation and positive stains for copper). 99, 100 The mean age of dogs with subclinical hepatitis was 3.8 years, compared with clinically affected dogs (5.5 years). The asymptomatic period lasted an average of 19 months. The prevalence of subclinical Doberman hepatitis was investigated in 106 randomly selected 3 year old Doberman Pinschers in the Netherlands. 27 Subclinical hepatitis was identified in 22 dogs (19 females and three males); hepatic copper concentration was higher in dogs with hepatitis (419 \u00b1 414 \u00b5g/g dry weight) than those without liver disease (197 \u00b1113 \u00b5g/g). 27 Serial liver biopsies over at least a 2-year period, revealed that hepatitis persisted only in dogs with copper levels greater than 400 \u00b5g/g dry weight, and copper levels continued to increase in these dogs (939 \u00b1 299 \u00b5g/g), supporting a relationship between copper, inflammation and hepatitis. 27 It has also been proposed that hepatic copper is incidental to chronic hepatitis in this breed, based on the findings that five of 35 Doberman Pinschers with chronic hepatitis had normal copper levels, and histologic changes were similar regardless of copper status. 81, 26, 75 An immune-mediated mechanism has been suggested, based on the finding that expression of MHC class II antigens on hepatocytes of dogs with Doberman hepatitis was correlated with degree of inflammation. 75 Aberrant MHC class II molecule expression on nonlymphoid cells could be a result of toxins, drugs, viral infection, or autoimmunity, and hepatocytes with MHC class II expression might become a target as an antigen-presenting cell for CD4+ T cells. 75 Dogs treated with low-dose prednisolone (0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg/day) for 4 to 5 months had significantly decreased expression of MHC class II antigens. 75 Chronic hepatitis should be suspected in any Doberman Pinscher (especially females) with clinical or biochemical evidence of hepatic disease. Definitive diagnosis requires liver biopsy. Other causes of chronic hepatitis should also be considered, since Doberman Pinschers appear to be at risk for drug-induced hepatitis. 71 Early detection of chronic hepatitis provides the best opportunity for treatment. It has been recommended that all Doberman Pinschers older than 1 year of age be screened for ALT activity. 99 Persistent increases in ALT activity suggest further evaluation including liver biopsy is warranted. The magnitude of increased ALT activity is not different between subclinical and clinically affected dogs. Hyperbilirubinemia is suggestive of more advanced disease. 28, 99 Effective treatment for Doberman Pinschers with chronic hepatitis has not been established. However, a preliminary study showed that if diagnosed in the subclinical stage, treatment with penicillamine (200 mg total dose PO BID for 4 months) lowered hepatic copper content and improved hepatic histopathology. 87 Traditionally, antiinflammatory or immunosuppressive drugs such as prednisone with or without azathioprine have been instituted. The efficacy of this treatment remains to be determined but generally, the response is poor if dogs are presented in advanced stages of liver failure. The use of ursodeoxycholic acid (15 mg/kg PO BID) deserves special consideration in this chronic cholestatic disorder, but has not yet been objectively evaluated. Treatment of copperassociated hepatitis in Doberman Pinschers with advanced disease is usually unsuccessful. Most dogs die within weeks to months. The prognosis appears more favorable if the disease is detected in the early stages, but the optimal therapeutic regimen remains to be determined. copper and morphologic examination remain the best option for diagnosis in the individual dog. 94 A database for certification of Bedlington Terriers is maintained on the Web site (www.caninehealthinfo.org) of the Canine Health Information Center, which is sponsored by the AKC/Canine Health Foundation and the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals.",

Although a hereditary mechanism is suspected, the pathogenesis of this disorder is unclear. 28 Copper accumulation appears to be associated with hepatic damage, but the pathogenesis is different from the Bedlington Terrier disorder. 27 Immune mechanisms may also play a role. 75, 81 Many Doberman Pinschers are diagnosed in the advanced stages of hepatic failure. 26 Evidence of excessive bleeding (gingival bleeding, epistaxis, and melena) are common. Signs of HE often predominate in the terminal stages. Common physical examination findings include ascites, jaundice, and weight loss. Splenomegaly (associated with portal hypertension) is common. Laboratory findings included increased ALT and ALP activity, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperammonemia, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia. 26 Typical histologic lesions include portal inflammation (lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages), piecemeal necrosis, bridging necrosis, bile duct proliferation, and portal fibrosis.",

Copper accumulation was originally attributed to secondary mechanisms, as Doberman Pinschers with advanced disease (chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis) have biochemical and histologic evidence of cholestasis. However, evaluation of affected dogs in the early (subclinical) stage, reveals that copper accumulation precedes cholestasis, 27, 95 and decreased biliary excretion of radiolabeled copper has been documented. 97 The hepatic distribution of copper and location of inflammation varies with the stage of disease. In the early stages, the copper (and focal inflammation) is centrilobular. 27, 81, 95 As the disorder progresses, copper accumulation and inflammation are more pronounced in periportal regions and areas of bridging necrosis. 95 Although copper appears to be related to the hepatic inflammatory reaction, copper levels are typically less than 2000 \u00b5g/g dry weight, the minimum amount of copper that is believed to cause hepatocellular injury in Bedlington Terriers and West Highland White Terriers. 60,61 A primary copper retention disorder has been proposed, 28 but the genes associated with Bedlington copper toxicity (COMMD1) and Wilson disease in humans (ATP7B) have been excluded. 98 SAMe, milk thistle), and symptomatic therapies that are not designed to lower hepatic copper. 37 Feeding a low-copper diet to 20 Labrador Retrievers with hepatic copper accumulation (seven of 20 dogs had varying degrees of hepatitis) was effective in decreasing hepatic copper concentrations, but severity of inflammation remained unchanged. 90 Additional treatment with zinc did not appear to increase the copper-lowering effect of dietary management. 90 Long-term survival appears variable. 36, 37 Dogs who died within 2 months of diagnosis were more likely to have a prolonged PT and thrombocytopenia. 37 ",

Ascites is the most consistent presenting complaint. Profound hypoalbuminemia (mean: 1.7 g/dL) is a consistent laboratory finding. Total serum bilirubin concentration is normal or only mildly increased, supporting that cholestasis is not a key feature of the disorder. Ascitic fluid analysis is consistent with a transudate or modified transudate. On liver biopsy, hepatic lesions are consistent with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis.

[36] [37] [38] A female predisposition was noted in two studies, 36, 38 whereas in another study, males and females were equally affected. 37 Most affected dogs have increased hepatic copper, which has been described as centrilobular (zone 3) or diffuse. [36] [37] [38] Copper concentrations exceeded 2000 \u00b5g/g dry weight in 10 of 12 dogs (mean copper: 3369 \u00b5g/g; range: 2375 to 4972; reference interval: 120 to 400 \u00b5g/g). 38 Most dogs also had elevated iron levels with a mean of 4117 \u00b5g/g (reference interval: 350 to 1750). 38 A genetic basis is suspected, based on the finding of increased copper concentrations in asymptomatic related dogs, but the genetic defect remains to be determined. 36 A retrospective survey of hepatic copper content in Labrador Retrievers during two time periods (1980-1997 and 1998-2008) , revealed significantly higher copper concentrations in the more recent period both in dogs with chronic hepatitis and in control dogs; no difference in age or gender was noted. 68 It was speculated that increased hepatic copper might reflect increased dietary copper bioavailability, because of pet food industry recommendations to replace cupric/cuprous oxide in feed formulations. 68 Treatment with penicillamine (15 mg/kg PO q12h) appears to be effective in decreasing hepatic copper content and inflammation. 36, 90 However, some dogs appear to respond to immunosuppressive (prednisone, azathioprine), supportive (ursodeoxycholic acid, Clinical features of cirrhosis in dogs include ascites (portal hypertension, hypoalbuminemia), HE (intrahepatic and extrahepatic portosystemic shunting of blood), and evidence of decreased hepatic function (hypoalbuminemia, increased SBA, coagulopathy, hyperbilirubinemia). Findings on hepatic ultrasonography (small nodular liver, splenomegaly, and acquired PSSs) are suggestive for cirrhosis, but liver biopsy is required for confirmation. Because cirrhosis is essentially irreversible, treatment is mainly supportive, emphasizing measures that control complications of severe generalized liver failure, such as ascites, encephalopathy, gastric ulcers, coagulopathy, and infection (see \"Complications of Liver Disease\" section). If clinical signs of liver failure are already present, the prognosis is poor.",

A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms may provide potential therapeutic targets. 106 The major fibrogenic cell in the liver is the activated HSC (Ito cell, vitamin A-storing cell), which is normally present in the perisinusoidal space. 106, 107 Under the influence of fibrogenic stimuli (inflammation and the immune response, oxidative stress, apoptosis, hypoxia, steatosis), the HSC is activated to a myofibroblast, which produces collagen and other extracellular matrix (ECM) constituents. 106 The cytokine, TGF-\u03b2, appears to play a central role in fibrogenesis in humans and dogs. 106, 108 Perisinusoidal fibrosis decreases the permeability of normal sinusoids, impairing metabolic exchange between hepatocytes and sinusoidal blood further compromising hepatic function. 106 Excess fibrous tissue also limits the ability of vessels and sinusoids to distend, resulting in increased resistance to hepatic blood flow and portal hypertension. When fibrotic septae become vascularized, these microscopic communications (between portal vein or arterial artery and hepatic vein) lead to portosystemic shunting of blood. Reversal of hepatic fibrosis and improvement in liver function can occur, especially if the underlying cause of injury is treated or removed. 106 Examples in human medicine include antiviral drugs for hepatitis B and hepatitis C and prednisone for autoimmune hepatitis. Although fibrosis is potentially reversible, cirrhosis for all practical purposes is not, because of the accompanying architectural changes and PSSs. 109 These ocular complications occur in approximately 20% of naturally infected dogs, and are caused by corneal endothelial damage and antigen-antibody complexes.",

An epidemiologic shift in serovars causing clinical disease has since occurred, with increasing reports of disease associated with serovars grippotyphosa, pomona, and bratislava. 118 It has been suggested that serovars icterohemorrhagica and pomona are more likely to be associated with hepatic damage. 118 However, other reports have been unable to correlate serogroups with specific clinical features. 119, 120 Chronic hepatitis has been associated with serovar grippotyphosa 50 and serogroup australis. 51 Reports of clinical leptospirosis in cats are rare, although antibodies to several serovars have been demonstrated. 118 Pathophysiology Acute renal failure is the most common clinical disease syndrome in dogs with leptospirosis. 121 The liver can also be a target organ and ALF may occur concurrently in 10% to 20% of dogs with acute renal failure or independent from renal involvement. 121 With acute hepatic involvement, the liver is enlarged, friable, and yellowbrown. Tissues are often markedly jaundiced. Microscopic changes in the liver include intrahepatic cholestasis, liver cell dissociation, and nonspecific reactive hepatitis. 3, 122 Hepatic necrosis is an uncommon histologic feature. The liver may not show striking changes, presumably because hepatic dysfunction can be caused by a toxin that produces mainly subcellular damage.

Other findings include hyperbilirubinemia, bilirubinuria, and abnormal liver function tests. An increase in BUN or creatinine may result from renal failure or prerenal uremia. The urinalysis is often compatible with acute nephritis with findings of proteinuria and increased temperature (36.7\u00b0C to 37.8\u00b0C [98\u00b0F to 100\u00b0F]) may be helpful.

The liver is also vulnerable to toxic injury because it plays a central role in the metabolism of many substances. Hepatic metabolism renders lipophilic substances more hydrophilic, which promotes excretion via the urine or bile. 17 The process is controlled by phase I and phase II reactions. Phase I reactions are catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems, which activate or detoxify (oxidize, reduce, or hydrolyze) a drug or toxin. Phase I reactions may lead to generation of unstable chemically reactive intermediates, which can be toxic. Phase II reactions conjugate drugs or metabolites and produce products that are nontoxic. During biotransformation, the liver can either reduce or enhance the toxicity of the parent compound. For example, after carbon tetrachloride ingestion, the liver converts the nontoxic parent compound into toxic metabolites, which subsequently cause severe hepatocellular damage.

However, morbidity is generally related to the underlying infection and not overt hepatic failure. 113, 124 Studies in humans and experimentally in dogs, suggest that endotoxemia and the subsequent release of cytokines induces functional changes that interrupt the transport and excretion of conjugated bilirubin. 113, 125 Microscopically, hepatic lesions are often mild and nonspecific. Intrahepatic cholestasis, characterized by bile canalicular plugs and bile pigment accumulation in hepatocytes, is the most consistent finding. 124 A mild periportal lymphocytic infiltrate can be seen, with scattered foci of macrophages or neutrophils, and occasional individual necrotic hepatocytes. Total serum bilirubin concentrations as high as 30 mg/dL can be seen and are disproportionately high compared to the mild to moderate increases in serum ALP activity. Increased serum ALT activity is a less consistent finding.",

Hepatic necrosis occurs when covalent binding of a drug or toxin to intracellular proteins disrupts cellular functions, or formation of drug-enzyme adducts stimulates an immunologic response (antibody-or T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity). Hepatic inflammation (typically lymphoplasmacytic, but may be granulomatous or eosinophilic), suggests an underlying immunoallergic mechanism. Intrahepatic cholestasis occurs when drugs or toxins interfere with hepatic transport proteins at the canalicular membrane, which interrupts bile flow. Hepatic lipid accumulation results when direct damage to mitochondria disrupts fatty acid oxidation and energy production, and is the predominant hepatic lesion seen with stanozolol hepatotoxicity in cats, 132 and tetracycline in dogs and cats. 126 Hepatic vacuolation caused by glycogen accumulation occurs in dogs treated with corticosteroids, and typically does not cause significant clinical evidence of hepatic dysfunction. Damage to the sinusoidal epithelium can result in peliosis hepatic or venoocclusive disease.",

Because intrinsic hepatotoxins predictably damage the liver in an exposed population, they can be experimentally reproduced and studied. Hepatic injury is caused by a direct toxic effect of the parent compound (or a reliably generated toxic metabolite) on vital cell targets. Acetaminophen is an intrinsic hepatotoxin in dogs and cats and is discussed in more detail later in this section. With intrinsic hepatotoxins, lowering the dose, rather than stopping the drug can be tried.

These reactions are unpredictable and infrequent; most individuals treated with the drug do not have a reaction, even at high doses. However, toxicity may be more pronounced at higher doses in susceptible individuals. 72, 133 Examples of drugs causing idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury in dogs and cats that have a dose-related effect are phenobarbital, itraconazole, amiodarone, and lomustine (CCNU). 134 Idiosyncratic reactions are characterized by a variable latency period (5 to 90 days, but may be longer for some drugs, such as phenobarbital, CCNU, amiodarone) from initial drug ingestion to recognition of hepatic injury. Because of the infrequent occurrence (approximately 1 in 100,000), the potential for hepatotoxicity may not be recognized in preclinical screening of a new drug, and cannot usually be reproduced in an experimental setting. Individual differences in susceptibility to idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury may reflect genetic differences in either (a) alternate metabolic pathways by which a drug is converted to different (potentially hepatotoxic) metabolites, (b) the ability of the individual to detoxify the toxic intermediates, (c) an underlying The Center for Veterinary Medicine of the Food and Drug Administration, Washington, DC, maintains a registry (http://www.fda.gov/ AnimalVeterinary/default.htm) for reporting adverse drug reactions in animals. This service has been useful to accumulate data and to alert veterinarians to suspected drug effects, including hepatotoxicity. However, because reporting of adverse drug reactions is voluntary and the information obtained may be incomplete, only subjective trends can be identified. Furthermore, because mild hepatic injury may not be associated with clinical signs, these cases will not be detected unless biochemical testing is performed while the animal is receiving the drug. Evaluating the incidence of druginduced liver injury in dogs and cats is further clouded by the fact that there are no pathognomonic clinical, laboratory, or biopsy findings to distinguish drug-induced liver injury from other causes of liver disease. Specific drugs that have been reported to cause druginduced liver injury are listed in Box 61-1.",

[127] [128] [129] In humans, herbal and dietary supplements are reported to account for 10% of patients with \"drug-induced\" liver injury. 127 The incidence of hepatotoxicity may be underrecognized, as only a third of humans taking herbal and dietary supplements reported their use of these products to their health care provider. 127 Causality is difficult to prove, because herbal and dietary supplements are often dispensed without medical supervision, FDA oversight of product quality is minimal, multiple active ingredients contribute to product variability, and product contamination with hepatotoxic substances (toxic herbs or heavy metals) may occur. [127] [128] [129] Drug interactions between herbal and dietary supplements and prescription medications may also occur, because medicinal plants can have effects on hepatic P450 enzyme systems. 129 The rate of dietary supplement use in dogs and cats appears to be lower than that reported for humans. 130 However, because these products are often marketed as \"all natural,\" pet owners may assume they are safe and underreport their use to the veterinarian. Reports of herbal and dietary supplement hepatic injury in animals are rare. Pennyroyal oil, a volatile oil derived from plants of the Labiatae family (pennyroyal, squaw mint, or mosquito plant) was associated with fatal acute hepatic necrosis in a dog after topical application for use as a flea repellent. Clinical signs occurred within 1 hour after application and included vomiting, diarrhea, hemorrhage, seizures, and death. Other reports include the finding of increased liver enzyme activity in dogs consuming St. John's wort, and increased ALT activity and hypoglycemia after accidental ingestion of high doses of \u03b1-lipoic acid in two dogs. 129, 131 The paucity of reported hepatic reactions does not necessarily mean herbal and dietary supplements are safe, and the clinician should maintain a high level of suspicion regarding their potential toxicity. Box 61-1 lists the herbal and dietary supplements that have been incriminated as causing hepatic injury in humans with potential relevance to dogs and cats. For more detailed information on hepatic injury and herbal and dietary supplements, additional sources should be consulted. [127] [128] [129] Hepatic injury may also occur after exposure to a wide variety of industrial chemicals, organic solvents, pesticides, heavy metals, and biologic toxins. Most information on chemical hepatotoxins is derived from experimental studies in dogs or extrapolated from information in other species. Very few clinical case reports are available in the veterinary literature. Isolated reports and case series of clinical liver disease in dogs associated with exposure to biologic toxins, such as aflatoxin, Amanita mushrooms, blue-green algae, and Cycads (Sago palms) have been published. Selected hepatotoxins are listed in Box 61-1.",

Histologic changes secondary to drug-and toxin-induced hepatic injury are nonspecific and similar to those seen with other nondrug-related causes of acute and chronic liver disease. 126 The most common pathophysiologic response is necrosis without inflammation. 126 Hepatic necrosis may be centrilobular (zone 3) or panlobular (Figure 61-20) . Centrilobular hepatocytes have an abundance of P450 enzymes, and are preferentially affected in drug-induced hepatotoxicity when P450 metabolism of the parent drug results in toxic metabolites. 8 Drugs or toxins can also cause a variety of other hepatic lesions, such as cholestasis, lipidosis, or mild inflammation.

Similar information on risk factors for hepatotoxicity in dogs and cats has not been determined. However, because many toxic metabolites are normally detoxified by glutathione, some metabolites may become more toxic when hepatic glutathione stores are depleted (e.g., animals with preexisting chronic necroinflammatory and cholestatic liver disease). 126 A breed predisposition has been suggested for Doberman Pinschers (sulfonamides, amiodarone, diethylcarbamazine/oxibendazole) and Labrador Retrievers (carprofen), which may be a reflection of a genetic predisposition. 21, 71, 73, 134, 137 Clinical Examination The spectrum of drug-and toxin-induced liver injury and, thus, the associated clinical presentation, can vary from subclinical hepatic injury with only increased serum liver enzyme activity, to severe liver damage manifested as ALF, or chronic end-stage liver disease. Acute rather than chronic liver injury is more likely for most of the drugs and toxins listed in Box 61-1. Clinical features often include acute onset of lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, PU, PD, or jaundice in a previously healthy animal, which corresponds to hepatotoxin exposure. ALF (signs of acute liver disease plus HE and coagulopathy) is most likely with drugs or toxins that cause diffuse hepatic necrosis. Drug-and toxin-induced injury is an important diagnostic consideration in dogs and cats presenting for acute hepatitis and hepatic necrosis.",

The diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury often relies on the clinician maintaining a high level of suspicion, and obtaining an accurate and thorough medication history (including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, and herbal and dietary supplements), in every animal with unexplained increases in liver enzyme activity or clinical liver disease. A definitive diagnosis of hepatic injury caused by biologic toxins or chemicals is rarely possible in a clinical setting, unless the owner specifically observes ingestion of a substance that is a known hepatotoxin. prevented. Treatment of drug-induced hepatic disease consists of discontinuing the suspect drug. After a drug is discontinued, clinical (and biochemical) improvement usually occurs within a few weeks, even with chronic drug administration. However, exceptions can occur. For example, in dogs with amiodarone toxicity, liver enzyme elevations can transiently progress despite discontinuation of the drug, and biochemical abnormalities may not resolve for 6 to 8 weeks. 137 With the exception of NAC for acetaminophen, and silymarin for Amanita mushroom toxicity, no specific antidotes are available, and treatment of drug-and toxin-induced liver injury is primarily supportive and symptomatic. However, nonspecific hepatoprotective therapy with antioxidants (vitamin E), glutathione replacement (NAC, SAMe), or milk thistle (silymarin) may be helpful and are discussed in more detail in Chapter 46. Use of NAC (or SAMe) may be beneficial, as glutathione depletion may predispose to hepatotoxicity (e.g., methimazole) or impair metabolism of toxic metabolites to a nontoxic form. NAC has been suggested to be beneficial for treatment of ALF associated with toxicities such as diazepam, methimazole, carprofen, and trimethoprim-sulfa. 9 In addition to treating Amanita mushroom hepatotoxicity, silymarin may be beneficial in the treatment of carbon tetrachloride and acetaminophen toxicity. 9,140,141 Corticosteroids are not typically indicated for treatment of drug-and toxin-induced hepatotoxicity.",

In therapeutic doses, acetaminophen is detoxified by a combination of hepatic glucuronidation and sulfation and renal excretion. 144 After acetaminophen overdosage, these pathways become saturated and a greater proportion of acetaminophen is metabolized through the P450 system, leading to production of the toxic metabolite, N-acetylp-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI). Glutathione detoxifies NAPQI and thus protects hepatic cellular constituents from its direct toxic effect. However, once glutathione levels are depleted by large amounts of NAPQI, centrilobular necrosis occurs. Toxicity occurs in a dose-dependent manner.",

Biochemical evaluation revealed marked increases in liver enzymes (ALT activity usually exceeded ALP activity) and hyperbilirubinemia. Hepatic biopsy findings revealed multifocal to diffuse hepatic necrosis, mild to moderate lymphocytic-plasmacytic inflammation, secondary cholestasis, and variable biliary hyperplasia and bridging fibrosis. 73 Concurrent renal toxicity (glucosuria without hyperglycemia, proteinuria, granular casts) also was noted in some dogs. Most dogs recovered with discontinuation of carprofen and appropriate supportive care, although some dogs died of ALF. General hepatoprotective therapy with SAMe or Silybin has been recommended, although the benefits are unproven. NAC has been suggested for ancillary treatment when carprofen causes ALF. 128 and vomiting. Although increases in serum ALT activity may be detected, centrilobular hepatic necrosis appears to be uncommon.

These hepatic effects can be seen with virtually any glucocorticoid preparation (including topical ophthalmic and otic preparations) and are influenced by drug preparation (e.g., repositol versus short-acting), dose, duration of therapy, and individual dog susceptibility. In contrast, cats are quite resistant to the hepatic effects of glucocorticoids and only rarely develop these hepatic changes. 153 Increased serum ALP activity can occur within 3 days after initiating glucocorticoid therapy in dogs and is often striking (up to 64 times normal). Glucocorticoids are associated with the induction of a specific corticosteroid-induced isoenzyme of ALP, which may account for 60% to 100% of the total ALP activity. 154 In contrast, serum ALT activity is often normal or only mildly increased. In most dogs, glucocorticoids do not cause significant hepatic dysfunction or clinically relevant hepatic disease and biochemical tests reflecting hepatic function (serum bilirubin, albumin, glucose, blood ammonia concentration, and coagulation tests) are typically normal. Serum bile acid concentrations are normal or only mildly increased (<60 mmol/L). Hepatic glycogen accumulation causes hepatomegaly (which can be detected on abdominal radiographs), and diffuse or multifocal increases in hepatic echogenicity (detected on ultrasonography). The hepatic effects of glucocorticoids are reversible after drug withdrawal. The length of time required for complete resolution is unpredictable, varying from weeks to months.",

            "text": "Depending on the amount consumed, dogs may present with acute, subacute, or chronic liver disease. High-dose exposure is associated with acute hepatic failure, jaundice, DIC, and death. Repeated exposure to low doses can lead to chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. In 2005, an outbreak of aflatoxicosis occurred in at least 100 dogs, as a result of eating a commercially available dog food manufactured with aflatoxin-contaminated corn. 138 Severity of clinical signs varied significantly among dogs. Some dogs died suddenly without preexisting signs of illness. Other dogs were presented with signs of anorexia, lethargy, vomiting, jaundice, diarrhea (including melena and hematochezia), abdominal effusion, HE, and evidence of a bleeding disorder. Common biochemical features included increased liver enzyme activity (especially ALT), hyperbilirubinemia, electrolyte disturbances, hypoalbuminemia, hypocholesterolemia, and prolonged clotting times. Reduced plasma antithrombin III and protein C activities and hypocholesterolemia were suggested to be the most sensitive biomarkers of aflatoxin ingestion in dogs with minimal clinical signs, possibly reflecting an early effect of aflatoxin on biosynthesis of certain proteins and cholesterol. 138 In dogs with acute or subacute aflatoxicosis, the liver is enlarged and pale yellow with histologic features of diffuse hepatic vacuolation (lipid accumulation), scattered individual hepatocyte necrosis, biliary hyperplasia, and modest inflammation. Collapse of zone 3 hepatocytes around the central vein, associated with perivenular inflammation, may explain clinical features of portal hypertension. With chronic low-level exposure, findings include a small liver with regenerative nodules, acquired PSS, and histologic evidence of marked biliary hyperplasia and periportal fibrosis. disease. 157 Potential indicators of clinically significant liver injury include increases in ALT and ALP activity that exceed five times the upper limit of normal; ALT activity that exceeds ALP activity; any elevation in AST activity; or enzyme elevations accompanied by evidence of hepatic dysfunction (hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypocholesterolemia, increased SBA). Hepatic cirrhosis associated with chronic phenobarbital therapy is characterized grossly by a small, nodular liver and histologically by bridging portal fibrosis, nodular regeneration, biliary hyperplasia, and mild inflammation (see Figure 61-19) . 70 These lesions are by no means pathognomonic for phenobarbital-induced hepatic damage; however, in the absence of other known causes of hepatic damage, circumstantial evidence would support drug therapy as a likely cause. Chronic phenobarbital therapy also is associated with superficial necrolytic dermatitis (hepatocutaneous syndrome) in dogs. 158 Liver biopsy changes were typical of those seen with hepatocutaneous syndrome (marked vacuolar change and parenchymal collapse), which are distinct from the characteristic chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis as described above. 158 Phenobarbital should be decreased or discontinued if possible in dogs with biochemical and histologic evidence of hepatic disease. In dogs with phenobarbital-associated toxicosis, clinical, biochemical, and histologic improvement can occur if the drug is discontinued or used at a reduced dosage prior to severe, end-stage liver disease. Improvement in clinical signs can be noted within days to weeks of decreasing serum phenobarbital levels. Primidone also is associated with chronic liver disease in dogs, likely as a consequence of metabolism of primidone to phenobarbital. Phenytoin can cause acute or chronic hepatitis in dogs, as well as jaundice and death. The risk of hepatotoxicity is increased with combination therapy of phenobarbital, primidone, and phenytoin. 126 Sulfonamides Potentiated sulfonamides (trimethoprim-sulfadiazine, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, and ormetoprim-sulfadimethoxine) are associated with the acute idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury in dogs. 21 Trimethoprim-sulfadiazine was implicated in over 20% of hepatic drug reactions in dogs that were reported to the Center for Veterinary Medicine between 1988 and 1990. 71 Doberman Pinschers are suggested to be at risk for development of polyarthropathy from sulfonamide hypersensitivity, but not necessarily the idiosyncratic hepatic reaction. 159 Onset of clinical signs occurs within 5 to 36 days (mean: 12 days) from starting the drug. 159 Previous exposure to sulfonamides is not required. Doses of potentiated sulfonamides are generally higher in dogs who develop the idiosyncratic hepatic reaction, as compared with other systemic manifestations of sulfonamide hypersensitivity (thrombocytopenia, fever, polyarthropathy, other). 159 Biochemical findings include increased liver enzyme activity (ALT > ALP) and hyperbilirubinemia. Liver biopsy usually reveals marked hepatic necrosis; however, cholestasis and marked lymphocytic-plasmacytic inflammation also have been described. 21 The pathogenesis of the idiosyncratic hepatic reaction is unclear. Dogs in general may be at increased risk for sulfonamide reactions because they lack genes that express the N-acetylation enzymes, which is a major metabolic pathway of detoxification of sulfonamides in humans. 21 However, this does not explain individual risks among dogs. Hepatotoxicity may be a result of P450 oxidation of sulfonamides to reactive metabolites, such as hydroxylamine and a nitroso metabolite, which may be associated with hapten formation, T-cell proliferation, or direct cytotoxicity. 21 Impaired detoxification of reactive metabolites via a deficiency in glutathione, cysteine, and ascorbate, may play a role, and theoretically supports the use of hepatocyte uptake of amanitins and has been shown to be protective against experimental A. phalloides liver damage in Beagles, when given at a dose of 50 mg/kg IV twice, at 5 and 25 hours after exposure. 141 However, an intravenous form of silymarin is not currently available for clinical use in the United States. Experimental studies suggest that penicillin G may also reduce hepatic uptake of amanitins, even several hours after ingestions. 162 IV NAC may be beneficial as described for treatment of acetaminophen toxicity. Overall mortality rate with Amanita mushroom toxicity is high.",

Dead or dying algae form a thick blue-green scum on the water's surface, and release the toxic principle, microcystins. Toxicity is caused by ingestion of algae-contaminated water. Signs occur rapidly (within 1 hour of ingestion) and include vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy, followed by progressive tachypnea and dyspnea, icterus, and coma. Biochemical features reflect hepatocellular injury with increased ALT and AST activity (that typically exceed increases in ALP activity), and hyperbilirubinemia. However, profound or protracted increases in ALT activity may not be detected, because microcystins can interfere with transaminase biosynthesis. 7 Hepatic lesions consist of massive hepatic necrosis of the centrilobular to midzonal hepatocytes. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Oxidative injury may play a role, 164 which suggests that glutathione supplementation (NAC or SAMe) may be of benefit. The prognosis is guarded.",

Concentrations of cycasin, the primary toxin in cycads, are highest in the seeds and roots, but present in all parts of the plant. 165 Ingestion of as few as one to two seeds can be fatal in dogs. Following ingestion, cycasin is metabolized by GI bacteria to its active compound, methylazoxymethanol, which causes GI and hepatic toxicity in dogs. 165 Most dogs that ingest cycads develop GI signs, including vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Neurologic signs (weakness, ataxia, depression, proprioceptive deficits, seizures, coma) are also common, but it is not clear if they are a result of a neurotoxin or HE. 165 Onset of clinical signs ranges from 15 minutes to 3 days and may last from 24 hours to 9 days. 165 Hepatic injury is suggested by findings of progressive depression, icterus, HE, and excessive bleeding accompanied by increased liver enzyme activity, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, and hypoabuminemia. 166, 167 Centrilobular hepatic necrosis is found on liver biopsy. 166 No specific treatment is available.

Xylitol was first introduced into the United States in 2002, and since that time, reports of toxicity to the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center have increased from two dogs in 2002 to 2512 dogs in 2008. 168 Ingestion of more than 0.1 g/kg in dogs is associated with a rapid, severe, increase in blood insulin, which results in signs of hypoglycemia within 30 to 60 minutes of ingestion. When amounts exceed 0.5 g/kg, ALF may occur within 9 to Aflatoxicosis associated with consumption of a commercially manufactured pet food product should be suspected when there is a geographic or temporal cluster of cases in a household, kennel, or region. The history may reveal recent changes in diet or feeding from a new bag. It should be noted that some dogs may consume contaminated food for weeks to months before signs develop. Definitive diagnosis of aflatoxicosis is based on chemical detection of increased levels of aflatoxin (>60 \u00b5g/kg) in the food. When aflatoxicosis is suspected, the owner should be advised to retain 1 kg of food in an airtight zippered plastic bag (or four cans of food), for laboratory testing. It is also recommended to save packaging information, including product and date code, to help identify contaminated lots of food. If a sample of food is no longer available, serum or liver samples can be submitted for testing for aflatoxin M1 (aflatoxin metabolite), although usefulness may be limited because of the rapid metabolism and excretion of aflatoxin. Detection of aflatoxin M1 in urine is only useful if the dog is still consuming the contaminated diet, as levels fall below detectable levels within 48 hours.",

Nonspecific hepatoprotective therapy with antioxidants (vitamin E), glutathione replacement (NAC, SAMe), milk thistle (silymarin), and L-carnitine have been recommended. 138 The prognosis is guarded if clinical signs of aflatoxicosis are present, with a reported mortality rate of 64% in a series of 72 dogs that consumed aflatoxincontaminated dog food. 138 Dogs that survive acute liver injury have the potential to develop chronic liver disease. Consequently, monitoring of liver function is recommended in recovering dogs and treatment with thiol donors such as SAMe for 2 months has been empirically recommended. 138 Amanita Mushrooms Amanita phalloides (and other varieties such as Amanita verna and Amanita bisporigera), are poisonous mushrooms found throughout North America that can cause acute hepatic necrosis in dogs and cats. 162, 163 Toxicity is attributed to extremely toxic cyclopeptide toxins called amanitins. Ingestion of two A. phalloides mushrooms can be lethal to an adult dog. 163 Clinical signs occur within 6 to 24 hours after ingestion and are characterized initially by GI signs such as vomiting, bloody diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The late phase (36 to 84 hours after exposure) is characterized by ALF (hemorrhage, marked hypoglycemia, HE, and terminal coma) caused by severe massive hepatic necrosis (see Figure 61 -20) . Toxin-induced renal tubular necrosis may also result in renal failure. 162 Biochemical features reflect severe hepatic injury and include increased liver enzyme activity (ALT exceeds ALP), refractory hypoglycemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. Diagnosis is usually made based on positive identification of the suspect mushroom, evidence of its ingestion, and consistent clinical features. Mushroom pieces in gastric contents can confirm exposure, but are difficult to identify. Accurate mushroom identification requires consultation with an experienced mycologist. The suspect mushrooms should be wrapped in paper towels and stored in a paper (not plastic) bag. 162 Definitive confirmation can be established by detecting amanitins in liver or kidney tissue (or serum and urine samples collected during the GI phase) by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, through the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory. 163 GI decontamination procedures are recommended as soon as possible after exposure, as described in the \"Treatment\" section of \"Drug and Toxin-Induced Liver Injury\". Symptomatic and supportive treatment for ALF is indicated, including close monitoring and treatment of marked hypoglycemia. Silymarin is believed to reduce Lower Urinary Tract Disease Ammonium biurate uroliths are formed most of the time in the bladder (and rarely in the renal pelvis) and can cause dysuria, urethral obstruction in males, and seldom uroabdomen as a result of chronic inflammation and subsequent devitalization of the bladder wall. 3 Ammonium biurate crystalluria is not pathognomonic for portosystemic shunting, and it may occasionally occur in normal dogs and cats, or be found in certain breeds, such as Dalmatians, because of an inborn error of metabolism.",

As the hydrostatic pressure in the sinusoids does not increase (in contrast to posthepatic portal hypertension), the resultant ascitic fluid will have a low protein content. The narrowed lumen of the portal vein causes reduced portal flow to the liver, resulting in reduction in the size of the liver. Portal vein thrombosis itself rarely causes clinical signs and is usually a coincidental finding. When the liver receives little portal venous blood, an insufficient amount of substrate (i.e., ammonia) is available for hepatic urea production.

The resultant sodium retention causes secondary water retention and subsequent PU by pressure diuresis. Hypokalemia caused by hyperaldosteronism also contributes to PU 50, 51 according to the following mechanism. The presence of aquaporin-2 channels in the renal collecting ducts' cell membranes is necessary for water reabsorption. Intracellular signaling pathways through cyclic adenosine monophosphate regulate the insertion of these channels. Hypokalemia decreases the sensitivity of cyclic adenosine monophosphate to arginine-vasopressin, which results in decreased insertion of aquaporin-2 channels into the cell membrane. 50 This leads to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and PU.",

            "text": "produced in the intestines of dogs with CPSS. 4 Their source is not quite clear: they could arise from the diet, intestinal flora, or by endogenous modification of inactive gut precursors. 4 In all forms of portosystemic shunting the concentration of aromatic amino acids are increased in the systemic circulation whereas the concentration of branched-chain amino acids is decreased. High aromatic amino acid concentration results from impaired hepatic clearance and increased production caused by muscular breakdown exacerbated by hyperglucagonemia. 28, 31 The decreased concentration of branched-chain amino acids results from their increased utilization for gluconeogenesis. 28, 32 This amino acid imbalance may result in the development of \"false\" neurotransmitters (e.g., octopamine) in the brain, which contribute to the development of HE. 33, 34 These \"false\" neurotransmitters have a fraction of dopamine's excitatory effect on dopamine receptors. Drugs with dopaminergic effect, such as bromocriptine, may improve signs of HE. [35] [36] [37] Intestinal toxins such as ammonia and bacteria are normally inactivated by hepatocytes and hepatic macrophages (Kupffer cells), respectively, so that toxin-and bacterium-free blood can enter the systemic circulation. In patients with portosystemic shunting the majority of the portal venous blood bypasses the liver, allowing the toxin-and bacterium-rich blood to enter the systemic circulation. Ammonia is a neurotoxin and can contribute to the clinical signs of HE. 38 Other toxins that are believed to play a role in HE are endogenous benzodiazepines, GABA, tryptophan, glutamine, serotonin, mercaptans, indoles, and skatoles. 4, 34, 39 Hyperammonemia also leads to impaired glial function through increased intracellular glutamine concentration. 38 Glutamine is made in the glial cells through incorporation of ammonia into glutamate by glutamine synthetase. 28 Chronically increased glutamine concentrations cause swelling of the glial cells resulting in so-called Alzheimer II type degeneration of astroglias. 40, 41 Glial dysfunction contributes to the development of HE. 40, 42 During hyperammonemia, the reserve capacity of the astrocytic glutamine synthetase is exceeded, and ammonia can enter the neurons. 42 In the neurons ammonia inhibits glutaminase, an enzyme that converts glutamine to glutamate. Because glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter, its reduced level contributes to the development of HE. 28 Portosystemic shunting or an atrophic liver alone is insufficient to allow HE to develop; HE can only develop when they are both simultaneously present. 28 The reserve capacity of the liver ensures that even in advanced chronic parenchymal liver diseases, HE does not develop in the absence of portosystemic shunting. Alkalosis and hypokalemia can worsen the signs of HE. In alkalosis the NH 3 + H + = NH 4 + reaction shifts to the left, causing the more lipophilic ammonia to enter the cells of the CNS. During hypokalemia, potassium ions (K + ) move from the cells to the extracellular space in exchange for H + , which later results in extracellular alkalosis and intracellular acidosis. Intracellular acidosis causes NH 4 + trapping within the cells. This might explain why the blood concentration of ammonia is not closely related to the severity of the clinical signs of HE in individual cases.",

Splenic venous injection of isotopes makes exact calculation of the shunting fraction possible (i.e., activity in lungs/activity in liver + lungs); however, the procedure requires anesthesia. Scintigraphy is the gold standard diagnostic imaging method to justify or exclude the presence of portosystemic shunting. However, differentiating congenital from acquired portosystemic shunting or intrahepatic from extrahepatic CPSS is not possible. Information provided by a scintigram is a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer to the question: Does the patient have portosystemic shunting? This answer can be reached much more easily and without using radiopharmaceuticals by documenting a single high blood ammonia concentration or by rectal ATT. images (A, B) . Arrows indicate the direction of blood flow. A and B, Intraoperative color-flow Doppler ultrasound images of the portal vein at the point where the congenital splenocaval shunt originates. Note that the diameter of the shunt (SH) is larger than that of the portal vein (PVcaudSH). The portal vein cranial to the origin of the shunt (PVcrSH) becomes narrower than the portal vein caudal to the shunt origin (PVcaudSH) because of hypoperfusion. A and C, Because blood always flows toward the lowest resistance, 100% of the portal venous blood flows through the shunt (SH) to the caudal vena cava (CVC). Note that the blood from the gastroduodenal vein (GDV) finds lower resistance to flow caudally toward the shunt, than toward the liver. This creates a hepatofugal flow (i.e., flow away from the liver) in the portal vein segment between the entering point of the GDV and the origin of the shunt (PVcrSH). Note that the portal vein becomes even narrower cranial to the point where the GDV enters it (PVcrGDV). The diameter of the various portal vein segments varies because of the varying amount of blood that flows through a certain segment. B and D, Note that partial occlusion of the shunt increases the resistance in the shunt to such an extent that the blood from the splenic vein (SPLV) finds lower resistance to flow through the shunting vessel toward the portal vein. This reversed flow in the shunting vessel (*) prevents the portal venous blood from shunting. Thus, even though the shunt is only partially closed, it is nonfunctional. Also note that the blood in the whole length of the portal vein is forced to flow toward the liver (i.e., hepatopetal flow direction), establishing normal perfusion of the sinusoids. A portion of the splenic venous blood will continue to flow through the attenuated shunt to the CVC, but the splenic blood contains no more toxins than any systemic vein, so no hyperammonemia develops.

The development of APSC has been documented with all surgical methods. APSC can develop as a result of underdeveloped portal branches or exaggerated shunt attenuation. 18 In most dogs, these APSC remain clinically silent because the hepatic mass has substantially increased following shunt attentuation. 18 All patients should be re-evaluated at 1 month after shunt attenuation by measuring fasting blood ammonia concentration and performing an abdominal ultrasonography. If fasting blood ammonia concentration is within the reference range, rectal ATT should be performed. If fasting hyperammonemia is present or the ATT is abnormal, ultrasonography should identify whether shunting occurs via the narrowed CPSS, APSC, or both. In the latter cases, lifelong conservative therapy with dietary modifications and lactulose is recommended. A normal ATT result implies complete shunt occlusion and the pet will generally have a very favorable prognosis.

Dysplastic nodules are characterized by cell atypia, cellular crowding, trabecular thickness, microacini, and histochemical markers. 20 Dysplastic nodules have not been reported in the dog or cat and further studies are needed to understand the chronology of hepatic malignancy in domestic animals. Preliminary reports of histochemical markers have been reported in dogs with hyperplastic hepatic lesions and hepatocellular and biliary neoplasms. 11 Liver tumors cause damage to the liver by several mechanisms: inflammatory effects, obstruction of the biliary system, obstruction of the vascular compartment or adjacent organs, and spontaneous rupture with hemoabdomen. 21 Hepatic tumors are usually resistant to chemotherapy. 7, 19 In one recent study, P-glycoprotein was more highly expressed in HCC than in cirrhosis, which is consistent with the known resistance of HCC to chemotherapy. P-glycoprotein, which is encoded by the multidrug resistance gene (MDR-1), is normally expressed in tissues with excretory function, including the jejunum, kidney, liver, and adrenal gland. 22 Primary liver neoplasms are usually classified according to their cellular origin and macroscopic appearance. With respect to cellular origin, these tumors may be hepatobiliary, hematopoietic, sarcomas, or metastases of other tumors (Box 61-2). In relation to macroscopic appearance, they can be classified as lobular, multiple nodular, or diffuse (). The combination of histopathologic and morphologic classification has consequences for prognosis and treatment strategy in these animals (Tables 61-6 and 61-7) , and the clinician must always address these factors to arrive at correct management decisions. In dogs, malignant tumors are more common than benign lesions. In cats, biliary neoplasms are the most common presentation, particularly intrahepatic benign forms. 6, 7 ",

Less-frequent clinical signs include vomiting and diarrhea, PD and PU, pale mucosal membranes, and acute weakness because of anemia and hypovolemia coincident with tumor rupture. 7, 19 Up to 25% of affected animals Diffuse or infiltrating, multiple coalescent nodules in all the lobes, or diffuse disappearance of the liver parenchyma; lobular, nodule or large mass in a single liver lobe; nodular, several nodules throughout the liver parenchyma, or several affected liver lobes. T1, tumor involving one lobe; T2, tumor involving more than one lobe; and T3, tumor invading neighboring structures); N represents regional lymph nodes (RLNs) (N0, no evidence of RLN involvement; N1, RLN involved; N2, distant LN involved); and M represents distant metastasis (M0, no evidence of metastasis; M1, distant metastasis detected). Although recommended, this system has not been universally adopted. 34 Table 61 -8 illustrates the most typical hematologic and biochemical findings in dogs and cats affected with liver neoplasia. Leukocytosis is a result of inflammation and necrosis of large tumors; anemia tends to be moderate and nonregenerative and is thought to be caused by chronic illness, inflammation, or iron deficiency 19 ; thrombocytosis is attributable to a paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by thrombopoietin production, iron deficiency, or anemia. 7 Serum liver enzyme elevation is a frequent, but not universal, finding in animals with liver neoplasia. It should be noted, however, that the degree of serum enzyme elevation does not correlate with the degree of liver involvement or severity of disease. In one survey, animals with primary liver tumors tended to have greater elevations in serum ALT and ALP activities than animals with metastatic disease, while the latter tended to have greater elevations in serum bilirubin and AST. 35 It also has been suggested that an AST-to-ALT ratio of less than 1 is more compatible with carcinoma, while a ratio of greater than 1 is more indicative of a sarcoma or carcinoid. 1 Other reported biochemical changes include hypoglycemia, hypo-or hyperalbuminemia, and increased serum bile acids. Hypoglycemia as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with hepatocellular carcinoma is attributed to the secretion of insulin-like growth factor II. 36 Unlike dogs, cats usually present with a high incidence of serum creatinine and BUN elevations. 28, 29 Coagulation factor abnormalities are more commonly associated with hemangiosarcoma, although DIC may be evident in end-stage liver cancer or in decompensated patients. Coagulation studies should always be performed before undertaking invasive diagnostic procedures. 23 Serum \u03b1-fetoprotein has been evaluated in the dog, and increases are reported in 75% of animals with hepatocellular carcinoma, and in 55% of those with biliary carcinomas. The use of this biomarker is limited by the fact that it is increased in cases of hepatic lymphoma and other liver pathologies, and only very dramatic elevations in \u03b1-fetoprotein may be taken to indicate hepatocellular carcinoma. [37] [38] [39] Abdominal radiographs often reveal a mass effect in the cranial abdomen, although this finding will depend upon the size of the neoplasm and the number and size of metastatic tumors. Other reported findings include dorsal displacement of the stomach, hepatomegaly, loss of abdominal detail (because of the presence of free abdominal fluid), and, occasionally, biliary tract calcification. Thoracic radiography should be considered as part of the staging procedure for animals with metastatic disease. 25, 40 Changes in the ultrasound density of the liver may take a variety of forms (Box 61-3). Most changes are not pathognomonic for a given disease process, and the final diagnosis is established only on the basis of clinical findings, laboratory testing, and results of cytology or histopathology (see . Ultrasound is also very useful for evaluating other abdominal structures, and for the staging of cancer. [40] [41] [42] ",

Liver carcinomas can be diffuse or affect multiple lobes, with variable ultrasound characteristics depending on the presence of necrosis, inflammation, hemorrhage, or cavitation. In these malignant tumors it is common to observe a mixed echogenicity pattern. Lymphoma can affect the liver without detectable ultrasound changes, or cause diffuse hypoechogenicity, hyperechogenicity, or mixed echogenicity with or without hypoechoic nodules. Consequently, if lymphoma is suspected, even if the liver ultrasound findings appear normal, fine-needle aspiration cytology is recommended. Histiocytic neoplasms are more often associated with multiple nodules and hypoechoic masses, although diffuse liver hypoechogenicity has also been described. Mast cell infiltration of the liver tends to produce diffuse hyperechogenicity. \u2022 Nodular patterns \u2022 Benign nodular hyperplasia is common, particularly in dogs, and accounts for many of the focal liver lesions identified at ultrasound exploration. It has been estimated that 25% to 36% of all nodular masses detected in the liver are nodular hyperplasia. \u2022 Benign liver adenomas or hepatomas can manifest as a focal mass of variable size and of normally hyperechoic characteristics. \u2022 The liver is a frequent location of metastatic spread, fundamentally through the portal system that drains most of the abdominal structures. \u2022 Primary liver neoplasms such as hepatocellular carcinoma can present as focal or multifocal masses, although less often so than in the case of metastases. Focal hypoechoic lesions with a hyperechoic center or core (referred to as target or bull's-eye lesions) are usually associated with metastases, although some benign processes, such as nodular hyperplasia, can generate similar patterns. \u2022 Biliary obstruction: Ultrasound has become an important tool for evaluating biliary obstruction in icteric dogs and cats. Primary tumors of the liver, biliary tract, duodenum, or pancreas are capable of causing biliary obstruction. Liver cytology has obvious limitations in that it cannot distinguish between liver adenomas and regenerative nodules, and even some hepatocellular carcinoma aspirates may be composed entirely of normal-appearing hepatocytes. In many cases it may prove necessary to resort to ultrasound-guided biopsy, laparoscopy, or exploratory laparotomy. However, cytology may prove useful in determining the presence of lymphoma, mastocytoma, and histiocytic sarcoma, as well as contribute to the initial classification of tumor type. Concordance rates between cytology and histopathology findings may be good for some disease processes, but the reported concordance rate varies from 14% to 86%. 44, 45 ",

MRI classified malignant hepatic lesions as HCC in all confirmed cases and correctly predicted the histologic grade of five HCC lesions. These results suggested that MRI is a useful modality for abdominal imaging in veterinary patients, and that MRI accurately differentiates benign from malignant focal hepatic lesions. 43 Liver cytology is useful in the initial evaluation of hepatomegaly and usually permits differentiation between primary tumors, metastatic disease, and focal infection (see . However, cytology does not distinguish between benign focal inflammatory disease and progressive chronic liver disease, and it cannot establish the extent and distribution of disease. Likewise, a definitive diagnosis of regenerative nodular hyperplasia cannot be established, and the technique is unable to differentiate a benign inflammatory reaction from cell changes associated with other pathologies. Contraindications to ultrasound-guided cytology include the following: \u2022 Coagulation abnormalities-If one or more coagulation test parameters are altered, it is advisable to administer vitamin K 1 via the subcutaneous route 12 hours before cytology. \u2022 Cavitary masses-The ultrasound detection of a large cavitary lesion in an elderly dog usually contraindicates cytology, A B tumors are more common in cats. 1, 13, 27, 61 Three morphologic forms or presentations have been described: lobular, multifocal, and diffuse. In general, only the lobular form should be considered for surgical removal as long as there is no evidence of metastasis. The prognosis for multifocal and diffuse bile duct carcinomas is very poor, surgery is usually not feasible, and most animals die within 6 months of surgery. 29 No effective chemotherapeutic options have been described for these malignancies in dogs or cats.",

            "text": "Also known as biliary cystadenomas, biliary adenomas, cholangiocellular adenomas, and cholangiomas, these tumors are common findings in aging cats. Males appear to be more frequently affected than females (Figure 61-28 ). In cats, 50% of these lesions are isolated or lobular and 50% are multifocal. 59 Biliary duct adenomas usually do not cause clinical signs unless they grow and compress other structures. 62 Despite the benign nature of these tumors, surgical removal is usually recommended because malignant transformation is always possible and because expansion into the porta hepatis may cause life-threatening consequences. 63 Liver lobectomy is recommended for cats with single bile duct adenoma or multifocal tumors confined to one or two lobes. In cats, surgical resection of biliary adenomas may provide cure or tumor-free survival of several years. 28, 29, 31, 59, 62, 63 Carcinoid Tumors Neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumors are infrequent in the dog and cat. In dogs, carcinoids have an aggressive biologic behavior and are usually not amenable to surgical resection as they tend to present as diffuse lesions (see Figure 61 -25). 1, 27 Carcinoid tumors in dogs have also been described in the gallbladder, and these have been managed successfully with cholecystectomy. 64, 65 Carcinoid tumors in cats can be intrahepatic or extrahepatic involving the bile duct and occasionally the gallbladder. 65 The extrahepatic form of carcinoid tumors may cause biliary tract obstruction, icterus, and increases in serum hepatic enzyme activities. Biliary tract diversion procedures should be considered for obstructive lesions involving the extrahepatic biliary tract. Unlike the circumstance in dogs and humans, female cats are more often affected by these tumors than males (female-to-male ratio of 5 : 1). 66 The prognosis of carcinoid liver tumors in dogs and cats is generally poor, and metastatic disease is present in 90% of the cases at Prognostic factors in dogs with massive HCC include need for surgery, liver lobe involvement, serum ALT and AST activities, and ratios of ALP to AST and ALT to AST. 26 Liver lobectomy is recommended for cats and dogs with hepatic tumors that have a massive morphologic appearance without metastases. However surgical complications are reported in more than 28% of cases, with a mortality rate of almost 12%. 26 The predilection of massive HCC for left-sided liver lobes has been reported. 27, 54 Advanced imaging and intraoperative ultrasonography may provide useful information on the relationship of right-sided and central liver tumors to the caudal vena cava prior to liver lobectomy. 40, 41, 43 Even though right-sided liver tumors have a poorer prognosis because of intraoperative death, there is no difference in the survival time after successful surgery. 26 The considerable regenerative capacity of the liver can permit successful resection of up to 80% of hepatic mass if the remaining tissue is functionally normal and critical supportive care is provided. 56 The median survival time for dogs with massive HCC following liver lobectomy is greater than 4 years. Without surgery the average life expectancy is 270 days and the prognosis is generally considered poor. 26 Tumor recurrence in dogs with massive HCC is rare and reported to be 0% to 13% after lobectomy. 26, 54 The prognosis for dogs with nodular and diffuse HCC is poor. Surgical resection is usually not possible because of involvement of multiple liver lobes.",

HCC is considered chemoresistant in humans although mitoxantrone has been reported to be helpful in some cases. 7, 56, 57 The most likely reason for the poor response to systemic chemotherapy is the expression of P-glycoprotein in hepatocytes. 22 Treatment options for nodular and diffuse HCC in humans include liver transplantation and minimally invasive procedures for regional control, such as ablation, chemoembolization, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, and low-dose metronomic chemotherapy. 56, 58 A recent report recommends therapy with sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor and antiangiogenic agent. 47, 48 Chemoembolization is a procedure commonly used in the treatment of diffuse hepatocellular carcinoma in humans with median survival times of 1 to 2 years compared with 3 to 6 months with systemic chemotherapy. 52, 51 In veterinary medicine, chemoembolization has been reported with moderate success in the palliation of four dogs with HCC. 52, 53 In cats, hepatocellular carcinoma is less frequent, and less data are available. 28, 59 Hepatocellular Adenomas These tumors are also known as hepatomas and are more common in cats than in dogs. In the dog it is sometimes very difficult to distinguish adenoma from reactive nodular hyperplasia, and biopsy is needed to clarify the diagnosis. The prognosis for adenomas is usually good, but it is advisable to remove focal mass lesions because they can grow and spontaneously rupture with severe bleeding. 19 Bile Duct Carcinoma (Adenocarcinoma and Cholangiocarcinoma) Bile duct carcinoma is the most common liver malignancy in the cat, and the second most common liver malignancy in the dog (see Figure 61 -27) . Tumor behavior is very aggressive in both species, and metastases are present at the time of diagnosis in 60% to 88% of cases. Bile duct carcinomas usually metastasize to the regional lymph nodes, lungs and peritoneum, kidneys, heart, adrenal glands, eye, and bone. 1, 60 Bile duct carcinoma can be intrahepatic or extrahepatic, but rarely occurs within the gallbladder. Intrahepatic bile duct tumors are more common in dogs, and extrahepatic bile duct must always be considered as a possibility when a hepatic tumor is diagnosed.",

A study in cats documented that abdominal lymphoma is currently the most common anatomic location and the liver occasionally is the only organ involved. 69, 70 Many protocols are recommended for treatment of lymphoma in dogs and cats; most include vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone, with variable combinations of L-asparaginase, methotrexate, and doxorubicin.

The result is a rapid mobilization of peripheral fat culminating in fatty accumulation in the liver. 1 Intracellular processing of fats is an important function of the hepatocyte. During fasting or starvation, fatty acid metabolism becomes deranged in an obligate carnivore as a result of obesity, catabolism, chronic overnutrition, impaired fatty acid oxidation or VLDL secretion, and enhanced hepatic fatty acid synthesis ( Figure  61 -29). 1,6-11",

Cats with HL often present with a history of acute stress and/or near-complete anorexia of several days duration. [1] [2] [3] Icterus is a variable feature of HL. When serum bilirubin concentrations exceed 1.5 mg/dL, clinical icterus can be observed on the pinnae, mucous membranes, sclera, and hard palate in the cat. In general, most cats with HL are obese at the time of presentation, with many cats being 20% to 30% over ideal body weight prior to an episode of HL. Other physical features of HL include hepatomegaly, dehydration, vomiting, and weakness. If HE develops as a consequence of HL, neurologic abnormalities such as ptyalism, stupor, coma, ataxia, and seizures may be observed. [1] [2] [3] A minimum database, including complete blood cell count, serum chemistry, and urinalysis, almost always reveals severe liver enzyme elevation and other abnormalities such as nonregenerative anemia, stress leukogram, poikilocytosis, and bilirubin crystalluria. 1 The pattern of liver enzyme elevation is typically cholestatic in nature and characterized by marked increases in serum ALP activity, followed by smaller increases in serum ALT and serum AST activities. Serum GGT activity is often normal in affected cats. Increased serum bile acids and bilirubin are often observed in cats with HL, and electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypophosphatemia and surrounding hepatic parenchyma, as well as alterations in the microvascular circulation. Vacuolar changes are seen frequently, suggesting a reactive or metabolic condition such us hyperadrenocorticism, lipidosis, or hypothyroidism. 77",

Classically, liver enzyme elevations consist of moderate to marked increases in ALP and GGT, and mild to moderate increases in ALT and AST. Bile acids may also be increased. 40 The low-dose dexamethasone suppression (LDDS) test is considered the screening test of choice for endogenous canine hyperadrenocorticism. 42, 43 The LDDS test has a high sensitivity at 92% to 95%. Only 5% to 8% of dogs with PDH will exhibit suppressed cortisol concentrations at 8 hours. In addition, 30% of dogs with PDH will exhibit suppression at 3 or 4 hours followed by \"escape\" of suppression at 8 hours. This pattern is considered diagnostic for PDH, making further testing unnecessary. 43 The major disadvantage of the LDDS test is the lack of specificity in dogs with nonadrenal illness. 44 The corticotropin (ACTH) stimulation test is used to diagnose a variety of adrenopathic conditions, including endogenous or iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism, as well as spontaneous hypoadrenocorticism. 42, 45, 46 As a screening test for the diagnosis of naturally occurring hyperadrenocorticism, the ACTH response test has a diagnostic sensitivity of approximately 80% to 85% and a higher specificity than the LDDS test. 45, 46 In a study by Kaplan and Peterson, only 15% of dogs with nonadrenal disease exhibited exaggerated response to ACTH stimulation. 44 I prefer the ACTH response test over the LDDS test as the ACTH response test is more accurate for the diagnosis of iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism (if the history is incomplete) and sex steroid imbalance in addition to PDH or adrenal-dependent hyperadrenocorticism.",

However, we have recognized few differences between the various forms 4, 9 and suggest that any statistically significant differences cited previously hold little clinical relevance given the large degree of overlap within data ranges. NC can occur in cats of any age, breed, or sex. Clinical signs are nonspecific and include anorexia, lethargy, vomiting, and weight loss. The duration of these clinical signs ranges from a few days to a few months and may be shorter in cats with ANC than in those with CNC, 3 but this is not a consistent finding. 4, 9 Physical examination findings commonly include dehydration and icterus. Fever is present in 19% to 37.5% of cases. 4,10 Some reports suggest that fever is more commonly associated with ANC than CNC, 10 while others recognize no difference. 4, 9 Hepatomegaly is seen in fewer than half of the cases. Abdominal pain is noted occasionally. 3, 4, 9 Diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis is made by examination of liver biopsy specimens, with ancillary diagnostics providing supportive information. Hematologic findings are variable and may include poikilocytosis, neutrophilia, and left shift, although these abnormalities are present in fewer than one-third of cases. 3, 4, 9, 10 Biochemical analysis commonly reveals increased activity of ALT, AST, ALP, and GGT ranging in severity from mild to severe. However, increased liver enzyme activity may be absent in some cases. Serum total bilirubin is increased in most cases. Serum cholesterol may become increased in cases with EHBDO. Imaging findings are nonspecific for cholangitis, but may provide useful information regarding concurrent disease. Abdominal radiographs are rarely helpful. Ultrasonographic appearance of the liver in cats with NC can vary greatly, with the most common abnormality being a diffuse change in echogenicity ranging from hypo-to hyperechoic. 11 Dilation of intra-and/ or extrahepatic bile ducts, gallbladder distention, increased gallbladder sediment, and thickening of the gallbladder or bile duct walls may be seen. Gallbladder distention and bile duct dilation may indicate EHBDO, but these changes may occur in cats with cholangitis lacking obstruction.

Although the true etiology remains unknown, NC is largely suspected to be caused by ascending bacterial infection from the intestine. 1-3 Rates of bacterial isolation using traditional methods have varied greatly, from less than 20% to more than 60% in affected cats. 3, 4 Recently, fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) with a 16S rDNA probe that recognizes bacteria in general has been used to identify and localize bacteria in cats with cholangitis. 5 Combining traditional culture and FISH, bacteria were isolated in three of three (100%) cats with ANC and eight of 13 (61%) with CNC. The localization of the bacteria identified using FISH supports translocation of enteric bacteria as the cause of infection. Although it appears that bacteria play an important role in the etiology of NC in many cases, it is important to note that they are not identified in all affected cats. Some authors theorize that NC, and CNC in particular, may have an immune-mediated etiology with persistent inflammation following an initial bacterial infection or other unknown initiating factor. 3, 6 Pathophysiology. NC in cats is commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease and pancreatitis. 3, 4, 7 The pathophysiology underlying the relationship of these diseases is unknown, but rational theories revolve around the unique anatomy of the feline biliary and pancreatic duct systems. In the cat, the common bile duct and pancreatic duct merge prior to entering the duodenum at the major duodenal papilla. 7 Cholangitis may develop secondary to reflux of ascending bacteria from the duodenum during vomiting. Pancreatitis may result from bacterial reflux into the pancreatic duct, or from pancreatic duct obstruction secondary to cholangitis. 7 In most reported cases, the inflammatory bowel disease associated with cholangitis is moderate or severe, whereas the pancreatitis tends to be mild chronic interstitial disease. 7 NC is also commonly associated with extrahepatic bile duct obstruction (EHBDO). EHBDO has been identified in 40% of cats with ANC and 76% of cats with CNC. 4 Cholangitis and/or pancreatitis are the most common cause of EHBDO in the cat. 8 In one study, 64% of cats with EHBDO had cholangitis, representing 93% of cats that did not have a neoplastic cause. 8 It is unknown whether cholangitis is the cause or the result of EHBDO. Histologic changes consistent with CNC have been seen in the livers of cats with EHBDO secondary to pancreatic carcinoma, cholelithiasis and surgical occlusion of the common bile duct. 8 In contrast, cholangitis has been implicated as the sole cause of EHBDO resulting from proliferation of mucosa within the common bile duct. 8 Bacterial choleretic properties that make it a rational choice for treating cholangitis.",

In five of seven cats with CNC evaluated at this institution, bile cytology revealed neutrophilic inflammation, presence of bacteria, or both. Techniques have been described for safely obtaining bile via ultrasound-guided percutaneous cholecystocentesis in lightly sedated cats. 15 Samples for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures should be obtained in any cat suspected of having cholangitis. Gallbladder bile is preferred to liver tissue as the culture source. In a group of 58 cats suspected of having hepatobiliary disease, bile cultures isolated pathogens in 36% compared with only 14% of liver cultures. 16 In the same study, 22 dogs and cats had both liver and bile cultured and none had a positive liver culture in the absence of a positive bile culture. 16 In a group of cats with cholangitis, bile cultures were more likely to isolate pathogens (75% vs. 33%) and less likely to yield contaminants (4% vs. 29%) than liver cultures. 4 In a small study comparing bile versus liver cultures in 22 cats with various hepatobiliary diseases, bile culture was positive in five (four had CNC) while liver culture was positive in only two. In the two cats with positive liver cultures, the same organism was isolated from bile. 17 It is important to recognize that many cats with NC (and other hepatobiliary diseases that mimic it clinically) are not stable enough to tolerate diagnostic testing. In such patients, the risk of aggressive diagnostics may outweigh the benefits of obtaining a definitive diagnosis. In these cases, the diagnosis may be suspected based on clinical response to supportive care, including broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.",

To optimize client compliance and avoid adverse drug reactions, I prefer to minimize the number of medications given to feline patients. Because most cats with ANC respond well to antibiotic therapy, I rarely include other medications in our treatment protocol. However, in cats with ANC that do not quickly respond to antibiotics and in many cats with CNC, I like to use UDCA. Among its theoretical benefits, UDCA has immunomodulatory and Distinction between LC and well-differentiated (small cell) lymphoma can be a challenge even for experienced pathologists. Preliminary data using immunohistochemistry and PCR for T-cell receptor clonality has not proven useful in differentiating between the two conditions. Surprisingly, cats with both LC and lymphoma had monoclonal T-cell receptors, oligoclonal T-cell receptors, and polyclonal T-cell receptors. 20 Using light microscopy, the following features were unique to LC and not present in cats with lymphoma: ductopenia, bile duct targeting by lymphocytes, and the presence of lipogranulomas within portal regions (representing a residual marker of cell death). 20 Until more studies are done evaluating molecular techniques, these features may prove useful in differentiating the two conditions. Interestingly, bile duct hyperplasia and fibrosis were present in cats with LC and those with lymphoma. This may suggest that an inflammatory state precedes the development of lymphoma, 20 which has been reported anecdotally.",

The therapeutic approach to cats with LC should be similar to that described for cats with NC in regards to supportive care and symptomatic treatment of the sequelae of liver disease. Because bacteria have been isolated from some cats with LC, I recommend treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics while awaiting results of bacterial cultures. In contrast to NC, long-term treatment of culture negative cats with antibiotics is not warranted. Immunomodulation and immune suppression are the major components of treatment based on a presumed immune-mediated etiology. Cats that are culture negative, or that have failed to respond to antibiotics within a few days, should be treated with prednisolone at 1 to 2 mg/kg twice daily. Responders should be tapered gradually over 4 to 6 months to the lowest effective dose. Other drugs that are useful for immunomodulation include metronidazole and UDCA. Cats that fail to respond completely to corticosteroids and/ or other immunomodulators, or who relapse while being treated, may require additional immunosuppressive drugs. Although these drugs have not been well evaluated in cats with LC, chlorambucil and methotrexate are suggested by some authors. 3 Cats with small cell lymphoma often respond to combination therapy with prednisolone and chlorambucil, but they may require a multidrug weekly sequential chemotherapy protocol.",

Cats with this form of LC in the United States have a similar clinical picture to cats with NC. 9 In the United Kingdom, this lesion has been associated with ascites, icterus, and hyperglobulinemia in young cats and termed progressive lymphocytic cholangitis. 22, 23 Etiology. Although the etiology of LC is unknown, theories suggest that it is an immune-mediated or infectious phenomenon. Genetic factors may also play a role, as Persian cats are overrepresented in the United Kindgom. 22, 23 Immunohistochemistry in affected cats has provided evidence for an immune-mediated pathogenesis, although the inciting antigen is unknown. 20, 23 Bacteria have been identified in the liver or bile of fewer than 20% of cats with LC. [3] [4] [5] 17, 20 Although Helicobacter pylori has been isolated from the liver and bile of cats with cholangitis, the evidence for this organism playing an important role in feline cholangitis is not compelling at this time. 24, 25 Pathophysiology. As with NC, concurrent inflammatory bowel disease and pancreatitis appear to be common in cats with LC, 3, 4 although some authors report it to be uncommon. 23 The theory that reflux of duodenal bacteria into the biliary and pancreatic ducts incites inflammation may hold true for cats with LC, although a common immune mechanism must be considered.",

As discussed for NC, ancillary diagnostics will provide information to support hepatobiliary disease, but are not specific for LC. Hematology results may be unremarkable, even though marked lymphocytosis has been described in some cases. 3 Activity of serum liver enzymes is increased in many, but not all cases and varies in severity. Hyperglobulinemia has been described. 3, 6, 22 Abdominal radiographic and ultrasonographic findings are nonspecific, but may aid in the recognition of concurrent disease. amoxicillin-clavulanate, milbemycin oxime, and amitraz prior to the onset of clinical signs. 31, 32 The proposed toxic etiology is based on these case histories and histopathologic similarity to humans with idiosyncratic drug toxicity. Other toxic insults and viral infection, such as canine distemper, can also result in destructive cholangitis. 1 Affected dogs typically present for signs referable to cholestasis, including anorexia, icterus, vomiting, and acholic feces. 31, 32 Activities of serum liver enzymes and total bilirubin are moderately to markedly increased. Abdominal ultrasound may be unremarkable, showing only mild dilation of intrahepatic bile ducts. 32 Definitive diagnosis is made by liver biopsy. Optimal treatment options are unknown, but should undoubtedly involve discontinuation of any medications that preceded illness. Corticosteroids for immune suppressive and antiinflammatory effects and UDCA for immunomodulatory and choleretic effects would be rational treatments options, but their efficacy has not been documented. The prognosis appears to be poor, as six of the eight reported cases were euthanized within 6 weeks and the remaining two had only shortterm followup (<6 months). 31, 32 NC, as described in the cat, has been rarely reported in dogs. [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] Bacteria have been isolated from the majority of cases reported, including E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus spp., and Clostridium spp. [34] [35] [36] [37] Although the bacterial species would support ascending infection from the intestine, the literature is too sparse to make conclusions about the pathophysiology of this disease in dogs. Bacterial infection could also spread hematogenously or via translocation from the portal circulation. The clinical presentation and diagnostic findings are similar to those reported for cats with NC. Affected dogs present with lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, and icterus usually of acute onset. Fever is reported in approximately half of the cases. [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] Neutrophilia with or without a left shift is common. Activity of serum liver enzymes is typically increased and most dogs have mild to moderate elevation of serum total bilirubin. Ultrasonography is nonspecific, with the liver varying from normal to hyperechoic with some heterogeneity. 34, 36 Thickening and hyperechogenicity of the gallbladder wall is common. 36 Definitive diagnosis is made by liver biopsy with changes similar to those reported in cats with NC. Most dogs have some degree of mixed inflammatory infiltrate, similar to CNC. [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] This infiltrate extends into the hepatic parenchyma in the majority of cases. Aerobic and anaerobic culture of bile or hepatic tissue should be performed, though bile has been the source of bacterial isolation in most cases. Treatment involves antibiotic therapy guided by culture and susceptibility results. Duration of treatment should be prolonged, as antibiotic courses of 8 to 12 weeks or greater have been required to completely eliminate bile infections. Clinical improvement precedes bacterial eradication. 36 The prognosis appears to be good in most cases, although dogs with concurrent disease may have a worse prognosis.",

            "text": "Liver cysts arising from the intrahepatic bile ducts are rarely encountered in veterinary practice. Although cysts may be acquired secondary to trauma, neoplasia, inflammation, or biliary obstruction, 1,38 the vast majority of cases described in the literature are congenital in origin. Congenital cystic liver diseases result in dilation of various segments of the intrahepatic bile ducts, and they are associated with varying degrees of hepatic fibrosis and cysts in other organs (most commonly the kidneys). Little is known about inheritance patterns of cystic disease in dogs and cats. The various morphologic patterns of cystic disease likely represent abnormalities of bile duct intermediate host. 26, 27, 29 The dicrocoelids tend to use an arthropod, while opisthorchids utilize fish. Typically cats acquire infection by ingesting the second intermediate host. In the case of P. concinnum, the sporocysts leaving the snail intermediate host may be eaten by a paratenic terrestrial isopod host (pill, sow, or dung bugs). 26, 29 Cats are infected by ingesting this form in a variety of lizard or amphibian intermediate hosts. Cercariae migrate from the cat intestine to the gallbladder and bile ducts, where they develop into adults. Eight weeks or more after infection eggs are passed in the feces to complete the life cycle. 27 Clinical signs are proportional to parasite burden. Cats with light infections are often asymptomatic. 27, 28 Clinically ill cats may present with nonspecific signs such as anorexia, lethargy, vomiting, or diarrhea. Severely affected cats present with signs of EHBDO such as icterus and acholic feces. [27] [28] [29] [30] Preliminary diagnostics are nonspecific for fluke infestation. Eosinophilia proportional to the parasite burden may be present. 29 Serum liver enzyme activity may be mildly to moderately increased, although it is normal in many cases. [28] [29] [30] Abdominal ultrasound often reveals evidence of EHBDO. [28] [29] [30] Definitive diagnosis by identification of flukes or fluke eggs in the feces is difficult as small numbers of eggs are shed daily, the eggs have varying morphology at different stages of development, and the eggs are quite small. 27 Fecal concentration-sedimentation using the formalin-ether technique is the most reliable method of identifying eggs in stool. 27, 29 Eggs may also be identified in cytologic preparations of bile. 28, 30 Eggs or adults may be seen in liver biopsy specimens, but they are inconsistently identified. 1, 27, 28, 30 Histopathologic changes seen in the liver are characterized by dilation of larger intrahepatic bile ducts associated with papillary projections and marked periductal and portal fibrosis. Mild to moderate inflammation may be present within the ducts (neutrophils and macrophages) and in the portal areas (neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells). Eosinophils may be present in limited numbers. 1 Rarely, chronic cholangitis associated with liver flukes can result in the development of cholangiocarcinoma. 1, 29 Optimal treatment protocols have not been established, but praziquantel at 10 to 20 mg/kg daily for 3 days appears to be the most effective. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] Doses as high as 40 mg/kg daily have been used successfully, 28 but this dose has also been fatal in cats. 26 Sporadic resumption of egg shedding following praziquantel has been reported, suggesting that it does not completely eliminate infection. 26, 27 For this reason, continued treatment at 12-week intervals has been recommended. 29 Symptomatic and supportive therapy should be tailored to the individual patient. Cats with EHBDO require surgical decompression. Glucocorticoids and UDCA may have some benefit in controlling inflammation and providing choleresis. Although infected cats may remain asymptomatic, patients with EHBDO appear to have a grave prognosis. Long-term survival has only been reported in rare cases. 28, 30 ",

Inheritance in Persian cats is autosomal dominant. 45 Liver cysts are thought to represent a late defect in the development of peripheral intrahepatic bile ducts. The liver may contain multiple cysts ranging from less than 1 mm to greater than 12 cm in diameter. These cysts typically contain clear, colorless fluid. Discrete fibrotic areas containing small, irregularly formed bile ducts, referred to as Von Meyenburg complexes, may be present. 1 In the kidneys, multiple cysts may form in any segment of the kidney but may involve only a small percentage of the nephron population. This is in contrast to the diffuse cysts seen with congenital dilation of the large and segmental bile ducts and juvenile polycystic disease. 1, 40 Hepatic cysts are present in 10% to 40% of cats with polycystic kidney disease, while hepatic fibrosis is recognized in up to 48%. 44, 45 The hepatic cysts are usually incidental findings and the animals are not clinically ill unless they develop renal failure secondary to cysts in the kidneys, which happens in adulthood.",

            "text": "Cholestasis is impaired bile flow resulting in the accumulation of bile components in the blood. 1 Intrahepatic cholestasis occurs secondary to a variety of primary or secondary hepatobiliary diseases. 1, 48, 49 Increased activity of serum liver enzymes, particularly ALP and GGT, is common with intrahepatic cholestasis but is not specific for the condition. Clinically patients may appear jaundiced, but the predominant clinical sign will be related to the underlying disease process. Cholestasis is marked by the presence of bile plugs in canaliculi, phagocytosed bile in Kupffer cells, and bile granules within hepatocytes. These changes are easily recognized in cytologic and frozen preparations, but are less apparent in paraffin-embedded specimens, particularly in cats. 1 When cholestasis is identified, EHBDO should be ruled out. This should be easily accomplished by abdominal ultrasonography as animals with intrahepatic cholestasis lack the dilation of intra-and extrahepatic bile ducts that is typical of EHBDO. 48 However, exploratory laparotomy should be considered in highly suspicious cases for confirmation. development at different stages of their formation. The WSAVA Liver Standardization group suggests that cystic disorders be classified into one of the following groups: congenital dilation of the large and segmental bile ducts; juvenile polycystic disease/congenital hepatic fibrosis; and adult polycystic disease. 1 Congenital dilation of the large intrahepatic bile ducts (i.e., the hepatic ducts and segmental ducts) has been described in dogs. [39] [40] [41] The lesion is similar to that of Caroli disease in humans and it is thought to represent an early defect in the formation of the intrahepatic bile ducts. 1, 40 The disease is marked by extreme, diffuse, grossly evident dilation of the extrahepatic portion of the large intrahepatic bile ducts containing pale-yellow viscous fluid. The gallbladder and common bile duct are normal, as these have a separate embryologic origin from the intrahepatic bile ducts. The liver is normal to mildly increased in size, with diffuse cysts of varying sizes throughout. Histologically there are areas of marked bridging portal fibrosis containing multiple dilated bile ducts. The lobular architecture of the liver is normal. Although concurrent ascending cholangitis commonly occurs in humans, this is rarely reported in dogs. [39] [40] [41] In addition to the hepatic lesions, affected dogs have fusiform, radially arranged renal cysts with moderate to marked fibrosis throughout the renal cortex and medulla. [39] [40] [41] Affected dogs are presented early in life, ranging from 13 weeks to 3.5 years. [39] [40] [41] Clinical signs include vomiting, weight loss/failure to thrive, decreased appetite, lethargy, ascites, and rarely icterus and neurologic signs. The clinical signs are typically chronic in nature. GI signs, neurologic signs, and ascites are likely a result of portal hypertension caused by pressure of the cysts on the portal vein. Hepatomegaly may be noted on physical examination. Activity of serum liver enzymes is typically normal to mildly increased, although marked increases in activity of ALT and ALP have been reported. 40 Renal azotemia is present in some patients. Ultrasonographically, cystic dilations of the intrahepatic ducts (most with associated calcification) are easily recognized, even though the renal cysts are not always apparent. Definitive diagnosis is made on the basis of the gross and histologic findings described above. Rational treatment options and prognosis are unknown, as only one dog in the literature has been treated. This dog was doing well on a low-protein diet at 5 months of followup. 40 Most of the affected dogs have been fairly stable, and supportive care may be warranted despite the appearance of severe cystic disease.",

The major causes of extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction (EHBO) are pancreatitis, gallbladder mucoceles (in dogs), cholelithiasis, parasitic infections (in cats), and tumors. EHBO is more common in dogs than cats. Biliary tract inflammation (e.g., cholecystitis, cholangitis) is primarily caused by bacterial infection, but can be nonseptic or parasitic, especially in cats. Gallstones may be associated with biliary tract disease (e.g., infection, obstruction), but the majority of them appear to be clinically silent. Stones in the gallbladder are termed choleliths while stones in the biliary tract are termed choledocholiths. Biliary tract exudation or leakage can be caused by traumatic (primarily of the bile ducts) or spontaneous rupture (primarily of the gallbladder). The latter is caused by necrotizing cholecystitis, which can be caused by sepsis (e.g., infectious cholecystitis), pressure necrosis (e.g., mucocele), or infarction. Biliary tract tumors are rare and of uncertain cause.",

Inflammation and edema with pancreatitis may be sufficient to cause compression and obstruction of the bile duct. This is probably the most common cause of canine EHBO. 1 There is, however, no consistent relationship between clinical severity of the pancreatitis and likelihood of EHBO, possibly because pancreatitis can affect different regions of the pancreas. Pancreatitis is a rare cause of EHBO in the cat. Chapter 60 discusses the breeds at increased risk for pancreatitis and causes.",

[54] [55] [56] Cholangiocellular adenomas commonly contain cystic components, especially in cats, and have been referred to as biliary or hepatobiliary cystadenomas in this species. 57,58 Cholangiocellular tumors arise predominantly from intrahepatic bile ducts in both species. Extrahepatic location is more common in cats than in dogs and is always associated with malignancy. [51] [52] [53] [54] 56 In both species, cholangiocellular carcinomas are more likely to present as multiple or diffuse tumors than are adenomas. 51, 52, 54 Carcinomas are highly metastatic (70% to 90% rate) with local lymph nodes, peritoneum, and lung being the most common sites of metastasis. 51, 52, 54 The etiology of biliary neoplasia is unknown. Affected dogs and cats are typically middle-aged to older, although animals with malignancy may present at a younger age than those with benign disease. 52, 56 Clinical signs are usually vague (such as anorexia and lethargy) and somewhat chronic. Malignant tumors are more likely to cause clinical signs, as many benign tumors are incidental findings not associated with illness. 51, [56] [57] [58] Hepatomegaly or the presence of a cranial abdominal mass may be identified on physical examination. Increased activity of serum liver enzymes is more commonly associated with malignancy, often being absent with benign tumors. 51, 56, 58 Even though abdominal radiographs will often identify the presence of hepatomegaly or an hepatic mass, ultrasonography is the preferred imaging method for identification of biliary neoplasms. This modality allows for determination of the cystic nature of the tumors 58 and for the evaluation of metastatic potential. Fine-needle aspiration and cytology are of limited utility for diagnosis of biliary epithelial tumors. Carcinoma was correctly identified via liver mass aspiration in only 20% of cases in one study. 14 However, cytology is recommended as it likely exhibits high specificity, especially for metastatic lesions. Surgical excision and biopsy is the optimal diagnostic and therapeutic technique for tumors confined to one or two liver lobes. Surgical excision appears to be curative in cats with benign tumors, 56,57 but malignant tumors carry a poor prognosis in both dogs and cats with many cases not surviving to discharge and survival greater than 6 months not reported in any case. 56, 59 Adjunctive chemotherapeutic protocols have not been reported.",

In health, the multiple branching of the main portal vein, venules, and capillaries reduces the overall resistance to blood flow (circuits in parallel reduce resistance), and therefore the pressure required to perfuse these capillaries is maintained at a low level of less than 5 to 6 mm Hg. 1,2 Disease processes that obstruct flow through the intrahepatic branches of the portal vein or sinusoids elevate this pressure and result in significant portal hypertension. Hepatocyte swelling impedes portal flow in acute pathophysiologic states, and fibrosis further impedes this flow in absolutely require it. Generally speaking, EHBO caused by pancreatitis that is not resolving as quickly as desired is not necessarily a good indication for this procedure; patience and medical therapy generally resolve the problem. In fact, pancreatitis can be a complication of surgery in this region. 24 Many animals with hepatic disease are concurrently treated with antioxidants and other hepatoprotectants. Although most of these drugs will not hurt patients with biliary tract disease (in fact, they may be beneficial if the disease is extending into the hepatic parenchyma, such as cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis), care must be taken before administering UDCA. UDCA is a choleretic agent that stimulates bile flow. This could be disadvantageous in a patient with complete EHBO.",

These patients consistently relapse after discontinuation of antibiotics, and therefore a cure may be achieved only with antibiotics plus cholecystectomy.

This is because a large number of other factors interact with the effects of ammonia to precipitate HE. Astrocytes play a central role because they express glutamine synthetase and detoxify the ammonia that reaches the CNS. Intraastrocyte accumulation of osmotically active glutamine in HE results in astrocyte swelling and thus low-grade cerebral edema. 8 This is largely reversible if the precipitating factors are treated, but edema can become severe and result in irreversible CNS changes in severe and acute HE. Precipitating factors include inflammatory cytokines, benzodiazepine-type sedatives, and disturbances in amino acid metabolism and dopaminergic neurotransmission. [8] [9] [10] The source of ammonia is primarily absorption from the gut, although other sources also exist as a result of interorgan metabolism. Gut-derived ammonia was traditionally assumed to be a by-product of intestinal bacterial metabolism in the colon. This remains an important source in some conditions such as melena. However, recent studies in other species suggest that small intestinal enterocyte metabolism of glutamine as their main energy source is the most important source of postprandial ammonia absorption in the portal vein. 9, 10 This is also likely the case in most dogs on normal diets as it is very unusual for undigested protein to reach the colon, although the source of gut-derived ammonia has never been investigated in dogs. In normal dogs, ammonia is transported to the liver via the main portal vein, and further metabolized chronic pathophysiologic states.

Hepatocyte loss caused by viral, bacterial, or chemical injury, or partial hepatectomy triggers hepatocyte replication. 23, 24 Liver injury not only stimulates hepatocyte turnover but may also stimulate biliary proliferation and activation and proliferation of HSCs. These changes usually occur together in an orchestrated wound-healing response. In the case of hepatocyte loss, normally quiescent hepatocytes replicate to restore the liver functional capacity and mass. These are the main cells that regenerate liver mass. However, in severe injury or where hepatocyte turnover is inhibited by senescence, a progenitor cell reserve may also replicate and regenerate liver mass. 24 Although hepatocytes are capable of replication, they have very slow turnover in a normal liver and there are negative consequences of long-term increased stimulation and turnover in chronic liver disease. It has been shown that cycling hepatocytes suffer irreversible erosion of telomeres, which leads to senescence. 25 Functional capacity is a relative rather than absolute parameter. The set point for growth regulation is the ratio between liver mass and body mass rather than liver mass per se. The optimization of the ratio indicates that the liver reaches a state in which it performs the amount of metabolic work needed to meet the functional requirements of the body. 24 Gene expression in the regenerating liver is a multistep process with at least two critical steps: the transition of quiescent hepatocytes into the cell cycle (\"priming\"), and the progression beyond the restriction point in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle. Hepatocytes must first be primed before they can fully respond to growth factors. As many as 70 different genes participate in the early response to hepatectomy, but TNF and IL-6 appear to be the major cytokines involved in the priming of hepatocytes. 20 The proliferative effect of TNF on hepatocytes is further influenced by reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and glutathione content, and at least four transcription factors (nuclear factor kappa B, STAT3, AP-1, and C/EBP\u03b2) play major roles in the initiation of early liver regeneration. 23, 24 Progression through the cell cycle beyond the initiation phase requires growth factors, primarily hepatocyte growth factor and TGF-\u03b1. The subsequent expression of cell-cycle genes, particularly cyclin D 1 , establishes the stage at which replication becomes growth factorindependent and autonomous. At this point, the hepatocyte is irreversibly committed to replicate and the cell-cycle replication machinery takes over. The regenerative capacity of the residual hepatocytes may restore liver mass and function after as much as 65% to 70% hepatectomy. 23, 24 Progenitor cells are only activated in severe liver injury. They appear to reside in a \"niche\" that is a particular regulatory environment. 24 A recent immunohistochemical to urea by hepatocytes in the Krebs-Henseleit cycle. With portosystemic shunting or severe hepatocyte dysfunction, ammonia accumulates in the brain (and other tissues) where it is taken up by astrocytes and results in edema as described previously.

In the brain, \u03b2-phenylalanine and tyrosine are metabolized to phenylethanolamine and octopamine, both of which can act as false neurotransmitters. However, dietary supplementation with branched-chain amino acids (e.g., leucine, isoleucine, valine) does not convincingly improve HE in either dogs or humans. 9, 12 However, some dietary protein sources appear to be better than others in dogs with HE. Dogs on soya protein diets show a lower plasma ammonia concentration than those fed meat protein. 13 Dogs with HE have also traditionally been fed a protein-restricted diet. However, protein restriction is no longer advocated in humans with HE 9 and it may be the digestibility and type of protein rather than a reduced amount that are most important in dogs. More studies are needed to investigate this.",

In severe acute liver injury, this becomes an important \"tradeoff\" because acute selective destruction of periportal (zone 1) hepatocytes more readily results in signs of encephalopathy because of the reduced ability of zone 3 hepatocytes to detoxify ammonia.

It is the balance between collagen production by HSCs and its degradation by matrix metalloproteinases that determines the severity and reversibility of the fibrotic response. Following acute or chronic liver damage, HSCs are stimulated to multiply and to undergo a complete phenotypic transformation from quiescent vitamin A-storing cells to contractile myofibroblasts which synthesize large amounts of ECM. 25, 29 Important stimuli for HSC transformation and multiplication in liver injury include oxidative stress; chemokines including platelet-derived growth factor; VEGF and TGF-\u03b2; adipokines; and parts of the innate immune system including Toll-like receptor ligands. 29 The role of adipokines in stimulating fibrosis is increasingly being recognized in humans, where nonalcoholic fatty liver disease can lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis. They are produced by HSCs themselves, as well as fat cells, and increased leptin and reduced adiponectin drive fibrosis. 29 Their importance in dogs is unknown and it is also unknown whether vacuolar or fatty liver diseases progress to fibrosis in dogs, but these are important questions to answer in the future given the widespread occurrence of obesity in dogs.",
