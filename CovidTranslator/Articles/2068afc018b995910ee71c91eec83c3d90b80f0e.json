Qingfei Xiaoyan Wan (QF), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, has been used clinically in China for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections, acute or chronic bronchitis and pulmonary infection. In this study, the effects of QF on Pseudomonas aeruginosainduced acute pneumonia in mice were evaluated. The mechanisms by which four typical antiinflammatory ingredients from QF, arctigenin (ATG), cholic acid (CLA), chlorogenic acid (CGA) and sinapic acid (SPA), regulate anti-inflammatory signaling pathways and related targets were investigated using molecular biology and molecular docking techniques. The results showed that pretreatment with QF significantly inhibits the release of cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8 and RANTES), reduces leukocytes recruitment into inflamed tissues and ameliorates pulmonary edema and necrosis. In ;6(3):212-221 addition, ATG was identified as the primary anti-inflammatory agent with action on the PI3K/AKT and Ras/MAPK pathways. CLA and CGA enhanced the actions of ATG and exhibited synergistic NF-\u03baB inactivation effects possibly via the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. Moreover, CLA is speculated to target FGFR and MEK firstly. Overall, QF regulated the PI3K/AKT and Ras/MAPK pathways to inhibit pathogenic bacterial infections effectively.",

Recently, TCM has been considered to highlight targets in interconnected pathways that can be used to cure complex disease. The integration of TCM and \"network\" pharmacology provides an innovative approach for TCM theory of both reductionist and holistic medicine, and bridges traditional application and modern drug discovery 2,3 . TCM was widely used for the clinical treatment of infectious diseases for thousands of years in China, and it is based on different philosophies than those of Western medicine, which are based on antibiotics 4 . Now, TCM has also played an important role in the prevention and treatment of infection during several large respiratory disease outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and acquired pneumonia 5, 6 . Although the precise mechanisms of action remain unclear from the perspective of modern medicine, a therapeutic regimen combining Chinese and Western medicines has gained acceptance because it reduces resistance and toxicity.",

QF is approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (No. Z12020757) and has been used clinically for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infection, acute bronchitis, acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and pulmonary infection with excellent clinical effects. In our previous studies, QF alleviates asthma and has anti-inflammatory activities 7, 8 . Four types of NF-\u03baB inhibitors, including arctigenin (ATG) derivatives, cholic acid (CLA) derivatives, chlorogenic acid (CGA), and sinapic acid (SPA), were screened 9 In this study, these anti-inflammatory compounds were quantified using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system. The effects of QF on Pseudomona aeruginosainduced lung infection in mice were investigated, and possible synergetic anti-inflammatory mechanisms for suppressing bacterial pneumonia by mutual regulation of the PI3K/AKT and Ras/ MAPK pathways were identified.",

            "text": "P. aeruginosa-induced pneumonia is a complex process. First, large numbers of thalli aggregating in the air way utilize flagellum, fimbriae, and polysaccharides on the membrane surface to adhere to respiratory epithelia 20, 21 . Then, the immune response of the host is activated via invasion of the type III secretory protein, quorumsensing system, pyocyanin, LPS and other virulence factors. Consequently, cytokines, chemotactic factors and other inflammatory mediators are produced by host cells, which recruit and activate macrophages, neutrophilic granulocytes, and T cells, resulting in severe lung injury and mortality [22] [23] [24] . In this study, we established a mouse acute pneumonia model with P. aeruginosa and the protective effects of QF were estimated by evaluating the expression of inflammatory mediators and the histopathological condition. The results indicate that pretreatment with QF significantly inhibits the release of cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8, RANTES), reduces leukocytes recruitment into inflamed tissues, ameliorates pulmonary edema and necrosis, and promotes the survival of mice. PI3K/AKT and Ras/MAPK are two important pathways for cell membrane receptor signal transduction, which are involved in both the inflammatory and immune response 25, 26 . LPS activates PKC and initiates pro-inflammatory signals, such as FAK and Ras 27 . FAK, a protein tyrosine kinase, can activate PI3K and MAPK to regulate the expression of cytokines in the immune and inflammatory responses 28, 29 . Furthermore, Ras is a GTPase, which activates ERK and p38 to regulate the generation of inflammatory factors 30 . By contrast, after binding to membrane receptors or activating JAK, cytokines and other growth factor can activate PI3K and MAPKs to regulate the proliferation and differentiation of cells and the expression of pro-inflammatory factors 31 . The proinflammatory factor TNF-\u03b1 is not only a basic factor of the inflammatory response, but it also acts on Gram-negative bacteria through a positive feedback pathway and synergistically enhances the infection 32 . In this study, cultured BEAS-2B cells induced with TNF-\u03b1 were selected for the inflammation model to assess the anti- inflammatory effect of QF in vitro. Four candidate compounds from QF were then selected to determine the synergistic antiinflammatory mechanisms.",
