DNA vaccination represents a new strategy for induction of humoral and cellular immune response. To determine the ability of SARS-Cov nucleoprotein (N protein) to induce antiviral immunity, in this report, we established a stable C2C12 line expressing SARS-Cov N protein, which was used as a target for specific CTL assay. We also expressed recombinant N proteins in Escherichia coli and prepared N protein-specific polyclonal antibodies. C3H/He mice were immunized with N protein-expressible pcDN-fn vector by intramuscular injections. We found that the DNA vaccination induced both N protein-specific antibody and specific CTL activity to the target. When C3H/He mice were immunized by three separate injections, high antibody titre (1:3200-1:6400, average titre is 1:4580) and high CTL activity (67.4 \u00b1 8.4% (E:T = 25:1), 69.6 \u00b1 6.7% (E:T = 50:1) and 71.8 \u00b1 6.2% (E:T = 100:1)) were observed. In the case of two vaccine injections, CTL activity was also high (56.6 \u00b1 12.7% (E:T = 25:1), 57.4 \u00b1 11.7% (E:T = 50:1) and 63.0 \u00b1 6.3% (E:T = 100:1)). However, antibody titres were much lower (1:200-1:3200, average titre is 1:980). Our results suggest that SARS-Cov nucleocapsid gene might be a candidate gene for SARS DNA vaccination.",

For example, nucleoproteins of Ebola virus [4, 5] , measles virus [6] , lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [7] and influenza virus [8, 9] may induce protective CTLs.

Based on these observations, we hypothesize that N protein expressed in viral infected cells may be a potent mediator of the body's immune system, and thus N protein may be a potential target for SARS-Cov vaccine. To address this issue, we detected N protein-specific immune response by use of DNA vaccine and, as expected, found that DNA vaccination with N protein could induce specific antibody and specific CTLs. Our results implicates that SARS N protein may be a target for DNA vaccination.",

The resultant plasmid (pGEM-fn) was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and a 1.2 kb released fragment was then ligated to pcDNA3.1 vector digested with the same enzymes. The recombinant plasmid (pcDN-fn) could express full length N protein in mammalian cells and was used as a DNA vaccine. pcDNA3.1 vector was used for vaccination control. To express recombinant SARS N protein in Es- cherichia coli for polyclonal antibody preparation, we used pfu DNA polymearase chain reaction with primer pair P1 (5 -GAATTCATATGTCTGATAATGGACCCC-3 ) and P2 (5 -AAGGATCCTTATGCCTGAGTTGAATCAG-3 ), and modified the SARS n gene in pGEM-fn by introducing NdeI and BamHI site to the 5 end and 3 end, respectively. pET-fn expression plasmid was made by ligating the NdeI/BamHI n gene fragment into pET24a vector digested with NdeI and BamHI. To make an expression plasmid of truncated N protein, pET-fn was cut with HindIII and BamHI to remove the region from 121 to 422 aa and then self ligated after blunting the ends by Klenow large fragment.

In this report, we detected SARS-Cov N protein-specific immune response induced by DNA vaccination and found that specific antibody titres were as high as 1:4580 and specific CTL activities were also high. These results indicate that N protein which, naturally exists in virus particles in after binding of viral RNA, was able to induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses when induced by DNA vaccine, and it might be a prospective candidate gene for development of SARS-Cov vaccine.",

They suggest the requirement of nucleocapsid protein for virus-specific antibody generation. This point was also supported by the data of TGEV [10] . Together with our results, therefore, we be-lieved that SARS-Cov N protein was of importance not only for enhancement of antibody production but also for specific CTL generation, and N protein was an important target for SARS vaccine.",

Our results in this study showed that level of antibody generation (1:985) after immunization with two injections was much lower than that of three injections (1:4580), but the CTL activity already reached a high level.
