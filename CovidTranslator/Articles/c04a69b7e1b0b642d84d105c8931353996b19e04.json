This study is focused on apoptosis and transcriptional profiling of FIPV-infected cells following in vitro infection of CRFK cells with FIPV 79-1146 WSU. Flow cytometry was used to determine mode of cell death in first 42 h post infection (hpi). FIPV infected cells underwent early apoptosis at 9 hpi (p \\ 0.05) followed by late apoptosis at 12 hpi (p \\ 0.05) and necrosis from 24 hpi (p \\ 0.05). Then, next generation sequencing was performed on 9 hpi and control uninfected cells by Illumina analyzer. An aggregate of 4546 genes (2229 down-regulated and 2317 up-regulated) from 17 cellular process, 11 molecular functions and 130 possible biological pathways were affected by FIPV. 131 genes from apoptosis cluster (80 down-regulated and 51 up-regulated) along with increase of apoptosis, p53, p38 MAPK, VEGF and chemokines/cytokines signaling pathways were probably involved in apoptosis process. Six of the de-regulated genes expression (RASSF1, BATF2, MAGEB16, PDCD5, TNFa and TRAF2) and TNFa protein concentration were analyzed by RT-qPCR and ELISA, respectively, at different time-points. Up-regulations of both pro-apoptotic (i.e. PDCD5) and anti-apoptotic (i.e. TRAF2) were detected from first hpi and continuing to deregulate during apoptosis process in the infected cells.",

The genome of this virus is approximately 30-kb in length with 11 open reading frames (ORFs) that encode 25 structural, non-structural and accessory proteins [3] . This virus has two main prototypes; feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) that usually causes subclinical or mild diarrhea with restricted infection in lower small intestine and colon [4] and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), which cause a systemic disease with granulomatous serositis with high amount of protein effusion (effusive FIP) or necrotizing and inflammatory lesions in variety of organs (non effusive FIP) [3] . Probably, FIPV is a virulent virus that arose from mutation in some sites like ORF 3c, spike (S) gene, and ORF 7b of FECV, which would change the enterocytes tropism to monocyte/macrophage cells [5] . These mutations would shift the localized intestinal infection to the severe systemic infectious peritonitis. Both these viruses contain two different serotypes based on virus neutralizing antibody reactions and sequencing [6] . Type I FCoVs are unique in cats with predominant prevalence in Europe and Americas [5] . Type II FCoVs with more than 25 % prevalence in Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s10495-015-1172-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",

            "text": "Despite over 40 years of research, the mechanism of FIPV disease and induced immunity remains ambiguous. Severity of FIP is correlated with imbalance of B cells and T cells population, where the cell-mediated immunity can properly shift the disease to the dry form whilst, increase of B cells and antibody response can lead to type III hypersensitivity, antibody-dependent vasculitis and effusive form of the disease [6] . Hence, during FIPV infection, depletion of the lymphoid cells plays an important role in the virus pathogenesis [9] . In addition, infection of macrophages can increase B cells activity and contribute to antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of the symptoms and effusive form of the disease [5] . Since FIPV does not infect lymphocytes, it seems that this virus cause the lymphopenia through apoptosis induction. Studies have reported that apoptosis of mononuclear cells and particularly CD8? T cells in infected cats is associated with the secretion of TNF-alpha from macrophages [10] . On the other hand, decreased of TNF-a along with high amount of IFN-c and IL-1b resulted in the augmentation of these CD8? T-cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the infected cats [11] . Therefore, apoptosis T cell is probably caused by soluble mediators released from infection to macrophages and/or intestinal epithelial cells [10] . Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of apoptosis during FIPV infection. The current study is investigating mode of cell death of Crandell Rees feline kidney (CRFK) cells and the transcriptome of the infected cells following infection with FIPV WSU 79-1146. Furthermore, this study focused on understanding the apoptosis process during the infection and genes that may involve in apoptosis induction mechanism of the virus.",

RNA samples from CRFK cells infected with FIPV strain WSU 79-1146 (ATCC \u00d2 No: VR-2127 TM ) (MOI of 3.0) at different time points (0, 1, 3, 9, 24 and 48 hpi) were extracted as described above followed by cDNA synthesis (High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit, Applied Biosystems \u00d2 ). Four ll of each cDNA was used to perform real-time qPCR using Maxima SYBR Green qPCR master mix (Thermo Scientific, USA) and specific primers for each gene (Table 1) . Melting curve analysis was performed to confirm the specificity of the results. In addition, for all these genes, non-template controls (NTC) were run in parallel with the samples. The mean C t values of all genes were normalized with three housekeeping genes (GAPDH, ACTB2 and GUSB) for relative expression analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Post Hoc Tukey HSD was conducted to determine the differences among the time points at 0.05 level of significance.",

Relative SD standard deviation, n number of samples expression analysis of these selected genes by RT-qPCR was in accord with results of the NGS fold change analysis. The only gene that did not show significant up regulation at 9 hpi was MAGEB16, which started to increase at 24 hpi. Although TNFa did not show significant deregulation at 9 hpi using RNA-seq analysis, the number of related affected genes including significant up regulation of FADD, TRADD, TRAF2, Tumor necrosis factor induced protein 1 and 3 (TNFAIP1 and TNFAIP3) show the importance of analysis of this cytokine during apoptosis mechanism of FIPV. Since specific feline TNFa antibody is not available commercially, the kit for canine TNFa detection, which has high homology to feline, was used during this analysis. Both RT-qPCR and ELISA analysis showed that TNFa production would be significantly increased during first 48 hpi of FIPV. The production of this cytokine started to increase significantly (p \\ 0.05) at 3 hpi compared to negative control. At 9 hpi, although neither mRNA expression level and intracellular concentration of TNFa did not show any significant difference with control, the extracellular concentration of this cytokine still showed significant higher concentration compared to uninfected cells; which probably explain the up regulation in other related genes at this time point. At 24 hpi, both intracellular and extracellular TNFa concentration started to drop to the normal state, which was in contrast to expression level of this gene that started to significantly increase at this time point.

However, since FIPV does not replicate in peripheral blood lymphocytes, it is difficult to consider that lymphopenia is due to direct destruction by virus infection of lymphocytes. We hypothesized that FIPV infected cells might release mediators that cause the induction of apoptosis of lymphocytes. Study has shown that TNF-a released from macrophages of FIP cats, induced apoptosis in lymphocytes, particularly CD8? T cells [10] . Transcriptome analysis of FIPV infected cells showed that the virus probably increase the inflammation through the chemokine and cytokine signaling pathways, Wnt signaling, Cadherin signaling, to name but a few (Tables 3, 4, 5). After 9 hpi, this virus could significant deregulate 4526 genes, which is much higher than 96 genes at 3 hpi according to a previous study by Harun et al. [22] . In addition, the expression of some of the ISG genes (e.g. ISG15 and ISG20), pro inflammatory and Th1-like cytokines (e.g. CCL8, CXCL10, and CCL17), genes related to innate immune responses (e.g. PHF11 and IRF1), and some genes like MX1 also showed significant up regulation (Supplementary Table 1 ), confirming the findings from previous study by Harun and his colleagues [22] .",

A previous study has indeed indicated that VEGF is highly related to pyogranuloma and effusive form of the disease [23] . The importance of p38 mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) pathway in cytokines production also has been reported by Regan et al. [24] during FIPV infection. A study showed that medium from FIPV infected macrophage-derived (fcwf-4) cell line could not induce apoptosis to cultured T cells [20] proposing that mediators released from virus infection to epithelial cells may cause T cells death and depletion. This can explain the reason of chemokines and cytokines signaling augmentation in parallel with increase of apoptosis during the infection (Table 5) . Furthermore, it has been reported that apoptosis prompt the activation of endogenous endonucleases, which lead to fragmentation of cellular DNA [20] . Hence, FIPV might use apoptosis as a viral strategy to enhance the spread of progeny to neighboring cells.",

FADD protein also contains a death domain that act as a bridge between Fas receptors and different procaspases, which form the death-induction signaling complex (DISC) during apoptosis [27] . In addition to FADD, DAXX was also unregulated. The C-terminal of this protein can interact with FADD and also activate Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and apoptosis pathways [28] . Hence, TNF-a play a pivotal role in apoptosis during FIPV infection, and according to our results, both mRNA and protein levels of this cytokine were significantly increased in the first 3 hpi, which would affect many of aforementioned pathways that induce apoptosis. After investigation of the trend of apoptosis and expression change of selected genes from apoptosis cluster, the TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and programmed cell death-5 (PDCD5) were the only genes that showed significant up regulation from the first hour after infection (Fig. 3) . Hence, the process of apoptosis induction of FIPV would be started as early as 1 hpi. However this process could not be detected by flow cytometry until 9 hpi. PDCD5 is a pro-apoptotic gene that is highly expressed in cells that undergo apoptosis [29] and may participate in the pathophysiologic course of disease involving abnormal programmed cell death [30] . Previous study also has showed that FIPV can up regulate the expression of programmed cell death-1 (PDCD1), a known pro apoptotic gene after 3 hpi [22] .",

It has been shown that anti-apoptotic response induced by SARS CoV infection in infected enterocytes is important to inhibit or delay cell destruction, which results in extending virus production and shedding.

Hence, it can be concluded that increase of communalities of pro apoptotic genes at this time point lead to significant augmentation of the number of early apoptosis cells and depletion of the viable cells. RASSF1 is known as a tumor suppressor gene by inducing cell cycle arrest at G(1)/S phase of cell cycle progression [35] . This gene can serve as a novel Ras effector [36] , and enhance apoptosis [37] . Over expression of BATF2 or SARI (AP1-protein suppressor), another gene of interest of current study, can result in inhibition of DNA binding activation protein (AP1), which causes growth inhibition and induced apoptosis particularly in cancerous cells [38] . Hence, AP1 protein and IFN-b can be another factors involved in FIPV apoptosis induction. The results of this study also showed significant (FDR\\0.05) up regulation in IFN a/b receptor 2 and down regulation of AP1 complex subunit beta-1 (AP1B1), which confirms the mechanism of action of BATF2 in apoptosis induction. Down regulation of BATF2 may result in poor prognosis of different types of carcinoma like hepato-cellular and squamous cell carcinoma [39, 40] . This gene is also up regulated in some other viral diseases like hepatitis E and hepatitis C [41, 42] . Table 2 ). All the selected genes showed high up regulations in this time point. Melanoma-associated antigen B16 (MAGEB16) also started to up regulate at this time point. The MAGE genes have come under attention of many scientists for gene therapy in cancer and even viral diseases [43, 44] . Different MAGE genes play variety of roles in apoptosis and cell activities [44] . The activation of these genes make them the antigenic targets for immune system [44] . For instance, co expression of MAGED1 and P75NTR of the neutrophils will result in enhancement of cellular apoptosis [43] . Hence, MAGEB16 can play an important role in late stages of apoptosis and necrosis of the cells during FIPV infection. After 48 hpi, BATF2 still showed high up regulation. Hence, this gene is an important factor during death stages of the cells. In this time point, all the other selected genes, even an anti apoptotic gene like TRAF2 were down regulated. Hence, it can be concluded that other mechanisms and pathways are involved in this stage.",

This study managed to propose the onset time of early and late apoptosis in FIPV infection and also identified the factors and pathways involved during FIPV infection. More studies are required to understand the role of these genes from different cellular functions, molecular processes, and biological pathways during FIPV pathogenesis. Among variety of involved factors, we have underlined the importance of apoptosis during FIPV infection.",
