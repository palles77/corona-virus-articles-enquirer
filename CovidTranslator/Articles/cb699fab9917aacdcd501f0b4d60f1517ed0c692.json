The nature of an outbreak can range from infectious, zoonotic, or chronic diseases to injury, exposure to toxic substances, or healthdamaging behavior. The cause can be incidental, accidental, or intentional, as in the case of a bioterrorism attack. Outbreaks require public health investigators to respond quickly and to make reasonable judgments from a dynamically unfolding set of information. Speed, coordination, and informed judgment are critical in these situations, as problems that at first appear limited may actually be significant outbreaks. A variety of approaches to outbreak detection and identification are possible, but the main points to keep in mind are described in the following section.",

This indicator measures the time lost to contain the spread of the infection. This is shown by a measles outbreak that occurred in the United States after a 34-year-old minister with an undocumented history of vaccination became infected while traveling abroad (Rooney et al., 2004) .

Since 1999, the New York City Department of Health has been monitoring and evaluating emergency medical service calls on a daily basis to identify an increase in respiratory illnesses that might represent an infectious disease outbreak . This is also the recommended method to detect possible intentional outbreaks due to bioterrorism (CDC, 2003) . Data sources used often already exist but have not been designed specifically for public health surveillance purposes. An example is the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), which contains coded health information from physician visit records. Data abstracted from emergency department logs or 911 calls can also be used through analysis of text or other developed coding systems (Pavlin et al., 2003) . In the case of a chemical agent, unexplained deaths among young or healthy persons or emission of unexplained odors by patients could indicate an outbreak.",

            "text": "Laboratory tests also play an important role. Cases are not always geographically clustered and for that reason are not always easily linked to an outbreak. The CDC and several state health departments established PulseNet, a molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance to facilitate the detection and investigation of foodborne outbreaks (Swaminathan et al., 2001) . Pulsedfield gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns of DNA from bacterial isolates are submitted to the national database and can help link apparently unrelated cases that are geographically dispersed. Though PulseNet can detect clusters of potentially related organisms, epidemiologic assessment is required to determine if the cluster contributes to an outbreak. PulseNet laboratories operate in public health departments in all 50 U.S. states and several national health and agriculture agencies. Most foodborne outbreaks are related to a local contamination such as in a restaurant, but a significant number are due to wide distribution of food contaminated at various points of production. An example is an E. coli O157 outbreak in 1992 linked with contaminated hamburgers that made more than 500 persons sick in 4 days and caused the deaths of four children (CDC, 1993) . It took 39 days for the public health system to recognize it as an outbreak and another 10 days to investigate and institute a recall of the contaminated meat. PulseNet can now increase the sensitivity of outbreak detection in many instances. For example, in September 2006, state and CDC officials were able to detect and link multiple small clusters of E. coli O157:H7 infections across the United States within days using PulseNet information. This allowed investigators to rapidly identify fresh spinach as the source of infection (CDC, 2007) . More than 200 cases were detected in 26 states and Canada ( Figure 4 ).",

This core team should establish a hierarchy for decision and information sharing. They should then create objectives for the investigation and develop plans for reevaluating the objectives as the investigation evolves. It is important to delineate roles and responsibilities for the relevant agencies and to agree on a timeline for reevaluating those roles. A lead agency and principal investigator should be identified. In the case of a large, complex outbreak, the need for additional human resources also has to be discussed. A list of types of expertise (e.g., epidemiologic, laboratory, statistical, communications) is required and availability of experts should be made known so that any gaps in expertise can be filled.",

This includes not only collecting and testing the specimens, but also tracking and monitoring the shipments of specimens. Some of this responsibility falls within the laboratory domain, but field investigators may also have to undertake some of these functions. The first step is to develop specimen collection and shipping protocols. This includes information about the samples that have to be included, such as type, quantity, and timing vis-\u00e0vis disease onset and treatment, but also the type of containers, transport media, and preservatives needed. The protocol must address information to be included on the labels, pre-shipping requirements, and instructions for shipping. The next step is to develop specimen processing and testing protocols for the receiving laboratories. These include not only the tests each laboratory will conduct but also how the results will be determined and interpreted and how and to whom the results will be released. If indicated, obtain the materials and supplies such as collection kits, testing reagents, control specimens, labels, and shipping supplies and ship it to the outbreak location. Once the specimens are collected, it is important to label them well and track them. In October 2001, a bioterrorism-related anthrax outbreak in New York City occurred. For weeks the New York Bioterrorism Response Laboratory (BTRL) was overwhelmed by the increasing number of environmental samples. To deal with the situation, a laboratory bioterrorism command center was established and protocols for sample intake, processing, reporting, security, testing, staffing, and quality control were developed (Heller et al., 2002) . The specimen load increased from 1 every 2 to 3 months to 2700 nasal swabs in 2 weeks and 3200 environmental specimens in 2 months. Staff increased from 2 to 75 persons and 6 tons of laboratory supplies were flown in from the CDC. Figure 5 shows the data flowchart adopted soon after the surge of isolates after the bioterrorism attack.",

One day later, an outbreak investigation was launched and 2 days later the first interventions to contain the outbreak were instituted: An isolation unit was set up in the local health-care facility, protective material for health staff was dispatched, and the public was alerted of the risk of infection during funerals. On October 14, the National Ebola Task Force was constituted to coordinate and mobilize resources for the outbreak, which lasted for more than four months. A total of 425 confirmed cases of Ebola were recorded, with 224 deaths among them. Identification of the origin or source of the disease by a trace back environmental investigation to prevent further illness is another important aspect of an outbreak investigation. This was done during a multicluster outbreak in Massachusetts. Between February 2003 and May 2004, ten outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness among schoolchildren at nine different schools were reported to the Department of Public Health (CDC, 2006) . All the children ate lunch provided by the schools and the disease was characterized by short incubation periods and short durations of illness. Based on prior investigations, a biotoxin or chemical agent was suspected. An environmental investigation identified three distributors who provided the schools with tortillas of different sizes and under various brand names but from one manufacturer. Several deficiencies at the plant were noted such as improper storage, use, and labeling of chemicals, food ingredients and additives, and food contact surfaces were not protected from environmental contamination. Samples were collected and analyzed. After the manufacturer was informed about the suspected cause of the outbreak, the recipe was changed and the amount of calcium propionate and potassium bromate used was lowered (CDC, 2006) .",

Recalled apple juice grew E. coli O157:H7 with the same PFGE pattern as those from the case isolates. The magnitude and severity of this outbreak led the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to propose two new regulations (Troxell, 2005) . First, all unpasteurized fruit and vegetable juices would have to carry a label stating, ''Warning: this product has not been pasteurized and therefore may contain harmful bacteria that can cause serious illness in children, elderly, and persons with weakened immune systems.'' The second regulation is the application of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles to fruit and vegetable juice processing (see the section 'Relevant Websites'). A HACCP program is a systematic method of identifying key production steps in which contamination may occur and instituting specific monitoring and interventions, such as pasteurization, at those steps.",

Traditionally, the number of cases is depicted on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. The time interval chosen can be months, weeks, days, or hours, depending on the estimated incubation period. Traditionally, the time intervals are one-fourth to one-third of the probable incubation period. An epicurve allows visualization of the epidemic's magnitude and the trend over time, and can predict the end of an epidemic. The curve also helps to estimate the incubation time, which can assist in defining the causative agent. An outbreak with a point source in time and place will give a tight temporal clustering of cases. An example is a norovirus outbreak in the United States linked with a specific restaurant in Eaton County, Michigan, in February 2007. The epicurve shown in Figure 6 reveals a peak in onset of disease around January 30 and a median incubation time of 32 hours. Investigation showed that more than 360 restaurant patrons became ill after eating in the restaurant on 2 consecutive days (CDC, 2007c) . If there is person-toperson transmission, each case can cause more cases, shown on the curve as a series of successive peaks. In 1997, passengers and crew members on a cruise ship developed acute respiratory illnesses possibly due to influenza (Miller et al., 2000) . The epicurve of the outbreak among the crew members is shown in Figure 7 . If the source is intermittent or continues over a long period of time, the curve will show a mix of individual and clustered cases during a relatively protracted time frame. Description of the geographic distribution of an outbreak provides information about the extent of the problem and can show any clustering or patterns that might provide more information on the source. Depending on the situation, cases can be mapped according to residence, place of occupation, and school or childcare settings, or related to possible relevant activities such as swimming or grocery shopping. A classic example is the map John Snow made to trace the source of a cholera outbreak in Soho, England, in 1854 ( Figure 8) (Snow, 1855) .",

The advantage of a cohort study is that attack rates and relative risk can be directly calculated. This design better suits outbreaks in which a limited and identifiable number of people were exposed to the risk factor or where one risk factor can have different outcomes. A typical example is a food-related outbreak at an event with a known guest list such as a wedding. People attending the event are asked if they became ill (thus meeting the case definition) but also which dishes they ate. This enables the investigators to calculate attack rates of disease among people who ate from certain dishes. The attack rate is the incidence of disease in a defined group. Attack rate exposed \u00bc # of people exposed to a factor who became ill # of people exposed to a risk factor Attack rate unexposed \u00bc # of people unexposed to a factor who became ill # of people unexposed to a risk factor The relative risk qualifies the relationship between the risk factor and the outbreak-related disease. It indicates how much more likely a person who is exposed to a certain risk factor is to develop the outbreak-related illness compared with a person who was not exposed. Table 2 shows the data of a classic outbreak investigation related to a salmonellosis outbreak at a church dinner in Oswego, New York, in 1940 (CDC, 2004 .

For the case-control study, 240 cases, as many as could be interviewed in a 2-week time period, were included. The 130 controls included meal companions of patients or persons who were identified through credit card receipts as having dined in the restaurant during a certain time period. Controls were excluded if they reported having symptoms or a history of acute hepatitis A or were vaccinated for hepatitis A. In March 2003, a nosocomial outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in a hospital in Singapore (Teleman et al., 2004) . To investigate factors associated with the transmission of SARS, a case-control study was conducted with 36 cases and 50 controls. The controls were selected among health-care workers working in the same ward as the cases, but who did not develop the disease although they had a history of exposure (exposure defined as being within close physical proximity [1m] of a patient subsequently confirmed with SARS). As the previous examples show, controls can be selected among different population groups, depending on the outbreak. In a community outbreak, a random sample of the healthy population may, in theory, be the best control group. In practice, however, persons in a random sample may be difficult to contact and enroll. Often random digit dialing is used, though this method has a potential for selection bias (Bunin et al., 2007) . The number of controls depends on the required precision and the number of cases. If there are more than 50 cases, one control can be selected for each case. If there are fewer cases, two or three controls per case may be needed to obtain sufficient statistical power to identify significant association.",

A very small p-value means that the chances of finding relative risk due to chance alone are very small.

The amount of information to be shared is crucial, as well as the method of communication to the right persons and groups at the right time. During the investigation, the epidemiologist should maintain regular briefings with local health officials. However, communication with the public is just as crucial. Often one person will be designated to communicate with the press and public. The content, frequency, and form of communication (e.g., internal meetings, email, press releases, or press conferences) have to be adapted to the target audience. The need to protect the public's health as well as innocent stakeholders who may or may not be responsible for the outbreak must be carefully balanced. As much specific information as is possible and appropriate about etiologic agents, mode of transmission, source and mode of contamination, and interventions and prevention measures should be provided. Although the need for communication with the public is important, communication with other agencies implicated Table 3 Distribution scheme for protective equipment initially used in care of patients with Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Bandundu region, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1995 in the investigation must not be overlooked. There exist several ways to inform public health professionals about ongoing outbreaks. An example is Epi-X, a web-based system that enables state and local health departments, poison control centers, and other public health professionals to access and share preliminary health surveillance information. Health Alert Network provides health information and has the infrastructure to support the dissemination of that information at the state and local levels in the United States.",
