The most effective plan for diagnosis and therapy may be for the clinician to make the owners aware of the clinical signs of aggression, alert them to the usual sequelae of early patterns, and direct them to a behavior specialist. 3. NOTE: Administration of a psychotropic drug as empiric therapy for aggression is not recommended before determining a possible cause and attempting to modify behavior through training. Denotes the presence of blood in the urine; the presence of trace amounts of blood in the urine will not be obvious on gross appearance of a urine sample. Therefore, any noticeable change in the color of urine observed by the owner is likely to be interpreted as \"blood in the urine.\" Further evaluation of the patient is necessary to determine whether or not the discoloration is associated with small blood clots in recently voided urine, bloodtinged urine, or brown or red urine. The presence of blood in the urine, whether gross or occult, is most often indicative of upper or lower urinary tract bleeding, although systemic coagulopathies and reproductive tract disorders may also cause hematuria. The presence of hemoglobin in urine (hemoglobinuria) is not necessarily a reflection of urinary tract disease.",

The metabolic consequences of decreased urine production are severe and generally represent significant compromises in renal blood flow or in the functional status of a critical nephron mass. The daily urine volume at which oliguria begin is a function of solute load and renal concentrating ability. In general, oliguria exists when daily urine production is reduced by 75% or more.

NOTE: The increased concentration of reduced hemoglobin in blood is the result of either an increase in the quantity of venous blood in the cutaneous tissues (passive venous congestion) or a decrease in oxygen saturation in capillary blood. It is the absolute, rather than the relative, amount of reduced hemoglobin that actually causes the cyanosis to develop. If the concentration of hemoglobin is also reduced, the absolute concentration of reduced hemoglobin is also decreased. Therefore, even in severe anemia, cyanosis is not evident. On the other hand, patients with an elevated red blood cell (RBC) mass, or polycythemia, tend to be cyanotic at higher levels of arterial oxygen saturation than patients with a normal RBC mass. Cyanosis also occurs when functional abnormalities of hemoglobin (e.g., methemoglobinemia [dark-brown blood]) exist.

Fundamental to the ability to interpret the presence of pain in an animal is the ability to recognize a change in behavior. Acute injury and associated pain is relatively simple to ascertain. However, chronic pain emanating from a specific organ or tissue (e.g., liver or bone) can be extremely difficult to define and localize. Other signs that may be associated with pain include sleeplessness; unusual posture; decreased activity; decreased appetite; reluctance to play, walk, or run; agitation; or altered grooming behavior. Physical findings are also highly varied and may include such findings as hypersalivation, mydriasis, tachycardia, shivering, or increased respiratory rate. Unfortunately, despite efforts to objectively measure pain in animals, there are no tests that clearly define whether or not an individual animal is experiencing pain.",

Thorough physical examination, to include careful neurologic examination, with particular attention to cranial nerves, funduscopic examination, and cardiac auscultation. 3. Laboratory database, essential to rule out metabolic causes. In addition to a CBC, biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and fecal culture, any or all of the following tests are indicated: serum ammonia, bile acids, serum insulin in hypoglycemic patients, blood lead test, and serial blood cultures. 4. Survey radiographs of the skull. These are rarely helpful, as intracranial neoplasms are not detectable on conventional skull radiographs. 5 . In special circumstances, limited ultrasound examination of the brain may be possible in young dogs through a cranial fontanelle. Evidence of hydrocephalus may be seen. 6. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (special facilities required). 7. Electrocardiogram or echocardiogram, if indicated. 8. Serologic studies for canine distemper, rabies, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), FeLV, FIV, toxoplasmosis, and systemic (deep) mycoses. 9. CSF analysis, including biochemistries, antibody titers, and cytologic parameters. 10. EEG.

Evaluation of the perianal skin (shaving the perineum is recommended). 2. Fecal examination for occult blood. 3. Abdominal radiographs or abdominal ultrasound to assess prostate size (in male dogs), presence of intra-abdominal masses, or presence of fecalith formation. 4. Colonoscopy or proctoscopy, with rigid or flexible endoscope and biopsy of any obvious lesions. Recovered tissues should be examined cytologically and by histopathology. Anesthesia is rarely required for this procedure unless the integrity of the rectal mucosa is substantially compromised or pain is significant. 5. Rarely, exploratory laparotomy, to further elucidate the nature of abnormal intraabdominal findings. Owner observations are not entirely reliable in describing dysuria. Therefore, physical examination is usually necessary to differentiate attempts to defecate from attempts to urinate and to distinguish between incontinence and dysuria. Dysuria generally results from disorders of the lower urinary tract (bladder or urethra), genital tract (prostate or vagina), or both that induce an impediment to urinary outflow resulting in abnormal micturition or inappropriate urination. However, a variety of neurologic lesions, particularly lesions in the caudal lumbar spine and sacrum affecting either parasympathetic or sympathetic innervation to the lower urinary tract, can result in dysuria.

Facilitation of these pudendal somatic neurons prevents urination. Urinary incontinence is the physical manifestation of any one of several disorders affecting voluntary urine retention in the bladder. Neurologic lesions involving either upper motor or lower motor neuron segments of the micturition reflex arc result in urinary incontinence. A paralytic bladder usually results in bladder overdistention and urine dribbling. Urine can be easily expressed by manual compression of the bladder in affected patients. A \"cord bladder\" is caused by a lesion between the brain and the spinal reflex center of micturition.

Because loss of visual function in animals is typically characterized by a change in behavior, the ability of pet owners to detect vision loss depends on their perception of changes in the animal's awareness of and interaction with its surroundings. Vision loss is likely to be apparent to owners only when there is complete loss of vision. An owner is unlikely to detect visual deficits, such as partial vision loss or unilateral blindness, because of the animal's ability to compensate. Blindness can occur in any of four ways: lesions causing opacification of clear ocular media (e.g., cornea, aqueous humor, or lens); failure of the retina to process visual images; failure of neurologic transmission; and failure in the final image processing (i.e., cortical blindness).",

Transillumination should be used to evaluate the ocular media. Such conditions as acute bilateral uveitis, severe corneal edema, bilateral acute keratitis, rapidly developing metabolic cataracts, or acute cyclitis with vitreous involvement may alter the ocular media to interfere with light transmission. Both direct and indirect pupillary responses should be evaluated while evaluating the anterior ocular media. Once it has been determined that light can reach the posterior ocular segment, a fundus evaluation should be done.

The distribution pattern of peripheral edema can be characterized as generalized, regional, or focal. Peripheral edemaUNCONTROLLED URINATION: URINARY INCONTINENCEUrinary incontinence: The lack of normal ability to prevent discharge of urine from the bladder. Urinary incontinence is suspected when an animal that previously exhibited normal control of urination begins passing urine at times or in places that are inappropriate. Determining whether or not the presenting complaint of inappropriate urinary behavior is involuntary can be a formidable task in a dog or cat. Distinguishing between voluntary and involuntary urination is fundamental to the diagnostic plan. The normal micturition reflex is a result of the complex interaction of the autonomic and somatic nervous systems. Normal control of micturition can be divided into a series of nervous pathways: 1. Sensory neurons have stretch receptors in the bladder wall that relay information through ascending spinal cord tracts to the brain stem and somesthetic cortex of the frontoparietal lobes. This pathway is the basis for the perception of a full bladder. 2. Frontoparietal motor cortex projects to the brain stem reticular formation centers for micturition that are responsible for storage and evacuation of urine. 3. From these centers, reticulospinal tracts descend the spinal cord to influence gray matter centers responsible for the storage or evacuation of urine. For evacuation, theDECREASED CAPILLARY ONCOTIC PRESSURE (HYPOALBUMINEMIA)Protein-losing enteropathies Protein-losing nephropathies Decreased hepatic synthesis Decreased dietary intake (protein malnutrition) Chronic hemorrhage Exudative lesion with large surface (e.g., burns, peritonitis) esp. tick-borne disease, e.g., ehrlichiosis) Neurogenic, physical, or other vasoactive stimuli",

If active chorioretinitis with or without exudative retinal detachment is present, determine if the inflammation appears granulomatous; if it does, consider systemic fungal infections and consider performing a vitreal or subretinal aspiration and cytologic examination to look for fungal agents. If inflammation is not granulomatous, perform a complete physical examination, CBC, and chemistry panel, and look for evidence of other systemic inflammatory diseases. c. If acute visual loss is unaccompanied by any fundus abnormalities, perform a complete physical examination, including a basic neurologic evaluation; if acute retrobulbar optic neuritis is suspected, a CBC and CSF examination should be considered; an ERG may be indicated to distinguish between SARDS and acute optic neuritis.",

Edema may become clinically evident as the serum albumin concentration falls below 2 g/dL.

Anorexia and vomiting are the most common associated, but nonspecific, signs. Weight loss, weakness, dark stool (melena), dehydration, and inactivity are other related signs having low diagnostic yield. Severe anemia can result from sustained gastric hemorrhage and, if acute, may justify exploratory laparotomy to identify the source of the bleeding.Increased water consumption and urination may suggest underlying renal or hepatic disease. Intracutaneous or subcutaneous tumors, specifically mast cell tumors, can be associated with severe gastric ulceration and bleeding.

In practice, icterus is an uncommon presenting complaint, since the dense hair coat of cats and dogs precludes early detection of bile pigment in skin. Icteric tissues are most evident in the sclera and in the oral, vaginal, and preputial mucous membranes, particularly in anemic patients. Icterus can occur subsequent to the accumulation of either unconjugated (lipid-soluble) or conjugated (water-soluble) bilirubin in the blood.Icterus can originate at any of three levels: prehepatic (hemolytic disease), hepatic (hepatocellular disease), posthepatic (obstructive or reduced bile flow).Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia results from rapid hemolysis (a common cause in the dog and cat), ineffective erythropoiesis, impaired hepatic uptake of conjugated bilirubin, or impaired conjugation. Conjugated (water-soluble) hyperbilirubinemia is generally the result of disorders intrinsic to the liver that affect bilirubin transport. Cholestatic disease is associated with reduced bile flow and can be characterized by significant bile acidemia and icterus.",
