            "text": "Among RNA viruses, the coronavirus has the largest genome, consisting of a 27.7 kb, single-stranded, positivesense RNA. The structural genes of the coronavirus genome encode spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Frequent point mutations in the hypervariable regions of the spike 1 (S1) gene contribute to most of the antigenic determinants of IBV. The N protein participates in binding to the viral RNA genome and forms a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. The N-and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD) of the N protein are mainly involved in RNA binding and oligomerization, respectively (Jayaram et al., 2006) . Recent evidence indicates that the NTD shows strong affinity for the transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS), which lies within the viral leader sequence and also precedes each viral open reading frame (Spencer and Hiscox, 2006) . This NTD-TRS binding is critical for the control of viral life cycle, including viral packaging, genomic replication and viral transcription (Grossoehme et al., 2009; Hurst et al., 2010) . RNA recombination has been shown to underlie the sporadic emergence of new variants of coronavirus, including the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a highly contagious avian pathogen. We have demonstrated that RNA recombination can give rise to a new viral population, supported by the finding that most isolated Taiwanese (TW) IBVs, similar to Chinese (CH) IBVs, exhibit a genetic rearrangement with the American (US) IBV at the 5 0 end of the nucleocapsid (N) gene. Here, we further show that positive selection has occurred at two sites within the putative crossover region of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the TW IBV N protein. Based on the crystal structure of the NTD, the stereographic positions of both predicted selected sites do not fall close to the RNA-binding groove. Surprisingly, converting either of the two residues to the amino acid present in most CH IBVs resulted in significantly reduced affinity of the N protein for the synthetic RNA repeats of the viral transcriptional regulatory sequence. These results suggest that modulating the amino acid residue at either selected site may alter the conformation of the N protein and affect the viral RNA-N interaction. This study illustrates that the N protein of the current TW IBV variant has been shaped by both RNA recombination and positive selection and that the latter may promote viral survival and fitness, potentially by increasing the RNAbinding capacity of the N protein.",

IBV is an important chicken pathogen that causes severe economic losses for global poultry industry (Cavanagh, 2007) . Genetic recombination in the IBV S1 and N genes has been documented in different field isolates, based on sequence comparisons and phylogenetic incongruence (Cavanagh, 2007) .

In general, TW IBVs are genetically closer to Chinese (CH) isolates than to American (US) strains. The only exception is the N gene of the TW IBV, which shows higher similarity to that of US strains. In particular, recombination in the NTD of the N gene has been detected in most analyzed TW IBVs. This phylogenetic incongruence suggests that RNA recombination can drive viral evolution at a population level.",

This sequence rearrangement may therefore pose a survival disadvantage for the TW recombinants by increasing their susceptibility to vaccine-induced immune surveillance (Chua et al., 2004) . Whether this recombination event in the TW IBV enables the offspring of the recombinant founder to become dominant and evolutionally preserved is rather unclear. In this study, we show that TW IBV recombinants have undergone positive selection at two amino acids within the putative crossover region of the NTD. Replacing either of these two residues with the amino acid present in most CH IBVs significantly attenuated the binding capacity of the N protein to synthetic RNA repeats of the viral TRS. These findings suggest that the fitness of recombinant TW IBVs has been increased by positive selection conferring a replication/ transcription advantage, even though these variants have been exposed to immune pressure in fowl vaccinated against US-like strains.",

The TP/64 strain shares high genetic similarity to most TW IBV isolates (Fig. 1A and B and Table  2 ). Three N protein mutants, including T64P (ACA to CCA, Thr to Pro), T64N (ACA to AAT, Thr to Asp), and T123V (ACT to GTT, Thr to Val), were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing (Fig. 3A) . The production of full-length N protein of TP/64 (arrow head in Fig. 3B ) was successfully induced by adding isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) in E. coli (Fig. 3B) . The N protein of TP/64 (wild type, WT) and the mutant N proteins (T64P, T64N, T123V) were purified by Ni-column and further examined by the staining with Coomassie blue in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3C) . The detected size of full-length N protein was around 57 KDa ( Fig. 3B and C) , higher than the theoretical prediction (45 KDa). The upper shift of band location of expressed N protein might be caused by the intrinsic charged aa components of the N protein but not post-translational modification in E. coli due to the same detected molecular weight (MW) of N protein produced by an in vitro transcription and translation system (Fig. S4 ). In addition, this upper shift of the N protein in SDS-PAGE were reported in a previous IBV N protein study (Yu et al., 2010) and other coronaviral N proteins (Hurst et al., 2009 (Hurst et al., , 2010 .",

Previous studies showed that the coronaviral N protein has a high affinity for the TRS sequence (Grossoehme et al., 2009) . A repeated TRS sequence has been used as a probe in the SPR experiments to measure the interaction of the N protein with viral RNA (Huang et al., 2009; Nelson et al., 2000) . The applied viral RNA probe consisted of repeated IBV TRS sequences, 5 0 -(CUUAA-CAA) 4 -3 0 and was biotin-labeled. One hundred resonance units (RU) were immobilized onto a streptavidin-coated biosensor chip for detecting the binding capacity of purified IBV N proteins. Compared to the wild type N protein, all three mutants showed significantly reduced TRS-binding capacity at 0.1 and 0.5 mM protein concentrations ( Fig. 4A -C,) (p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA, Tukey's post hoc analysis). When the protein concentrations were elevated from 0.05 mM to 0.5 mM, proportional increases in their RNA-binding capacities were detected (Fig. 4C) . The T64P variant, which mimicked the 64 aa position of US Beaudette strain, showed about half the RNA-binding capacity of the wild type TW N protein (Fig. 4C ) (p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA, Tukey's post hoc analysis). Likewise, the T64N and T123V variants, which represented the most common configurations of aa 64 and aa 123 in the CH N protein (52.2% and 91.3%, respectively) ( Table 2) , showed only 30-40% of the RNA-binding capacity of the TW TP/64 strain (Fig. 4C ) (p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA, Tukey's post hoc analysis). The ANOVA analyses also revealed that the RNA-binding activity between the pairs of mutants (T64P, T64N and T123V) has no significant difference. Taken together, these results indicate that both aa 64 and 123 are critical for 5 0 -(CUUAACAA) 4 -3 0 binding, and the modulation of these two residues may affect the binding affinity of the N protein for viral genomic or subgenomic RNA.",

These two parameters are assumed to be constant across the tested sequences for the analyses of CODEML, especially when the positive selection is evaluated by branch-site method based on a likelihood ratio test (Scheffler et al., 2006) . To avoid false result of the positive selection in this study, the possible recombinant IBV strains, such as TW3374/05, TW2992/02, TW3381/06 and TW3382/06, are excluded ( Fig. 1A and B ) and the selected strains are chosen from the population in a same clade. In addition, the candidate of positive selected sites (Table 1) is evaluated by a codon-substitution model but not a branch-site likelihood model. Finally, the fidelity of the mathematic prediction by CODEML is further validated by the experimental function assay, demonstrating that the positively selected sites are critical for the viral RNA-binding activity. In addition to forming part of the RNP, the coronaviral N protein participates in the formation of the replicationtranscriptional complex. Specifically, the N protein's NTD binds to the TRS of the leading sequence and regulates TRS-cTRS (complementary TRS) helical unwinding (Grossoehme et al., 2009) , suggesting its critical role in genomic duplication and subgenomic expression. In this study, we showed that substituting either of the positively selected residues with the amino acid present in most CH IBVs dramatically reduced the binding capacity of the N protein for synthetic TRS repeats (Fig. 4) . Although neither selected site is located in the RNA-binding groove of the NTD, the modified residues may alter the secondary structure or surface charge distribution of the N protein and consequently affect RNA-NTD interactions. Here, phylogenetic evaluation of viral proteins not only helps us to reconstruct the evolutionary paths of viral species but also provides new insights into functional residues in viral proteins.",

In this study, SPR binding assays of point-mutant IBV N proteins demonstrated that the positively selected residues in the TW IBV N protein may improve binding efficiency for viral TRS repeats.

            "text": "Given that vaccine-based immunization imposes strong selective pressure on viral evolution, we did not rule out the possibility that the avian immune system has reshaped the recombinant N protein of TW IBV through positive selection. Both S and N proteins are known to be major antigenic determinants of IBV (Cavanagh, 2003) . Administration of N proteins via intraperitoneal injection can elicit protective adaptive immunity against an IBV challenge (Cavanagh, 2003) . We speculate that the TW IBV, sharing epitopes in the NTD of the N protein with the US-serotype IBV because of an RNA recombination event, may have become more vulnerable to attack by the adaptive immune system in fowl vaccinated against the Connecticut or other US-like IBV strains. To counteract this adverse effect, it is possible that residues in the a-turn (aa 63-67) and surrounding peptides located in an externally exposed loop (or a turn) have been positively selected to attenuate antigenic recognition by host B lymphocytes. This speculation is supported by the fact that almost all the test TW IBVs were isolated from vaccinated flocks and were under immune selection pressure. In addition, a recent study on MHV infection, which emphasized that epitope-escape coronaviral strains can be quickly selected by genetic deletion or mutation under strong immunological pressure (Chua et al., 2004) . In addition, it has been suggested that the a-turn region (aa 63-67) may form an antigenic epitope in the IBV N protein (Ignjatovic and Sapats, 2005) . Future works will aim to determine whether the mutations at aa 64 and 123 of the N protein in adapted strains result in altered epitope determinants and consequently provide competitive benefits for quasispecies in hosts by allowing the selected TW strains to escape immune surveillance.",

The N protein expression was induced by adding 1 mM IPTG for 4 h at 25 8C when the OD 600 value reached 0.4-0.6 (arrow head) (B). The cells were collected and suspended in the lysis buffer (described in Section 2). The crude cell lysates were applied to resin affinity columns and N protein fractions were eluted with a buffer containing 8 M urea.
