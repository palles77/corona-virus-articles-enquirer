The Indian Medical Mission extended health-security to approximately 140,000 pilgrims, through outreach medical teams, primary-care clinics, tent-clinics, secondary-care hospitals and evacuation capabilities. Data on medical attendance, bed-occupancy, investigations, referrals, medication usage and deaths was compared. Outpatient attendance was 374,475 in static-clinics, 5135 in tent-clinics and 13,473 through task-forces. 585 (62.90%) in-patients were hospitalized amongst 930 secondary-care referrals. Secondary-care bed-days were 2106 with average bed-occupancy being 77.78%. 495 patients were institutionalized in tertiary-care Saudi-Arabian hospitals. Infectious diseases were most commonly (53.26%) encountered due to overwhelming respiratory-infections, followed by trauma (24.40%). Analgesics (66.38/100 patients) and antibacterials (48.34/100 patients) were frequently prescribed. Crude mortality amongst Indian pilgrims was 11.99/10,000. Risk-factors associated with high morbidity were old-age and pre-existing comorbidities. Overwhelming surge of patients facilitates transmission of communicable infections and leads to stress induced physical, mental and compassion fatigue amongst healthcare personnel. Respiratory infections are highly prevalent and easily transmissible during Hajj leading to significant morbidity, increased burden to existing health facilities, overwhelming costs on health systems and globalization of multiresistant pathogens. Diabetic patients should avoid heat exposure and use protective footwear during Hajj rituals. Mass-gathering medicine at Hajj can be optimized by improving patient knowledge on performing Hajj at a younger age, medicine compliance, avoiding self-medication, self-monitoring of hypertension, blood glucose, and preventive health measures; screening of pre-existing comorbidities; and resource augmentation with telemedicine networks and decision-support systems.",

(c) One mobile referral tent-clinic having 5-6 doctors, 5-6 paramedics per shift at Mina and Arafat during the five critical days of Hajj catered to 35 satellite tentclinics. (d) Mobile medical task-forces having one doctor and two paramedics per shift covered mass-gathering congregations along the pilgrimage assemblage expected to have 5000-100,000 Indians. Onward referral was to secondary-care or tertiary-care Saudi hospitals. (e) Two 40-bedded secondary-care referral hospitals having 8-10 doctors, 8-10 paramedics per shift catered to 13 staticclinics in Mecca, a 14-bedded facility catered to five static-clinics in Medina. Secondary-care referral hospitals catered for critical care, internal medicine, general surgery, orthopaedics, gynaecology, paediatrics, psychiatry, dermatology, isolation, lab-medicine and radiology. (f) Tertiary-care transfers were coordinated with 30 Saudi-Arabian hospitals in Mecca, Medina and Jeddah. Data on medical attendance, bed-occupancy, procedures, investigations, referrals, medication usage and deaths for 2016 was compiled and compared with previous years.",

Upper and lower respiratory infections, gastroenteritis and diabetes related skin and soft-tissue infections were seen. Respiratory infections outnumbered all other forms of illness. 90% healthcare personnel reported respiratory infections presenting as cough and viral prodrome, sometimes leading to sickness absenteeism. Upper respiratory infections presented as throat pain, sinusitis or otitis after a viral prodrome resembling common-cold or influenza like illness. Lower respiratory infections presented with productive cough, dyspnoea and fever more so in pre-existing lung conditions such as bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Acute gastroenteritis presented with vomiting and diarrhoea, with a history of food intake from multiple sources. Diabetic patients largely presented with pneumonia and cellulitis foot. There was inadequate glycemic control at presentation due to poor medication and precautionary compliance despite prescriptions of insulin and oral antihyperglycemics from India. Urinary tract infections (UTI) were found to have a predilection for female sex, diabetes and benign prostatic hypertrophy. Orthopaedic, trauma and musculoskeletal diseases included fractures, dislocations, myalgia, osteoarthritis, sprains, low backache, sciatica and crush injuries. 45% of all fractures were Colle's fracture due to fall on outstretched hand from escalators, beds or washroom flooring. Blunt trauma during mass-gatherings led to shoulder dislocation and chest wall injuries. Myalgia, osteoarthritis, sciatica and low backache precipitated due to stress, exertion, dehydration and old age. Crush injuries and metatarsal fracture occurred from overstepping of feet and wheelchairs during moving assemblage.",

Drug induced gastritis was common after self-medication of analgesics and antimicrobials. Various forms of de novo contact dermatitis and intertrigo along with pre-existing chronic skin conditions were seen. Most common pre-existing conditions were diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( Table 2) . 29.20% in-patients were treated in secondary-care for gastrointestinal disorders followed by 20.90% for respiratory diseases (Table 3 ). Most secondary-care hospitalizations were done for Table 4 . Frequent referrals for tertiary care were made for acute myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure, unstable angina, arrhythmia, COPD with complications, severe pneumonia, hemiparesis, chronic kidney disease, heat stroke, diabetic foot requiring amputations, fractures requiring internal/external fixation, advanced investigations and imaging. 21% were referred to tertiary-care for cardiovascular diseases followed by 16.80% for orthopaedic surgeries.

The secondary-care and tertiary-care medical usage rates exemplify that most patients report with low acuity complaints which can be handled in primary-care, provided it is accessible to Hajj pilgrims. Similar age, sex, comorbidity and admission profile has been reported by other studies [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Overwhelming surge of patients is a triple edged challenge.

There are operational challenges at diagnosis, therapy and control of globalization of potentially multiresistant pathogens [2, [11] [12] [13] . The prevalence of respiratory symptoms has been found to be as high as 77.60% amongst Hajj pilgrims which can lead to epidemics and pandemics [14] . Increased post-Hajj prevalence of respiratory viruses from 7.40 to 45.40%, and bacteria from 15.40 to 31%, and consequent globalization has been proven [2, 14, 15] . Overcrowding during mass-gatherings increases the risk of transmission of respiratory pathogens such as rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and other coronaviruses, influenza A H1N1, influenza B, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, enterovirus, multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB), Streptococcus pneumoniae during \"Hajjcough\". Ebola, MERS, Alkhumra viral haemorrhagic fever, and Rift Valley Fever have high outbreak potential during Hajj. Both pandemic and seasonal influenza are simultaneously transmitted during Hajj [16] . In turn, this also leads to increased antibacterial prescription, increased self-medication, empiricism and incompleted antimicrobial regimens, furthering the emergence of multiresistant bacteria. Prescription audit and promotion of nonpharmaceutical preventive measures are mandated, however it remains a resource intensive effort in the realm of mass-gathering medicine. Syndromic surveillance can form early warning outbreak detection system, however it may have limitations due to short duration of diseases, asymptomatic carriage of pathogens, oligosymptomatic presentation, under-reporting to healthcare facility by patients, and inter-observer variation in research cohorts [2, 14, 17] .",

Multiple comorbidities seen in approximately 20% patients represent a big burden on tertiary-care Saudi hospitals and form the main risk factor for mortality during Hajj [8, 14, 16, [18] [19] [20] [21] . Diabetic patients are prone to heat illness, cellulitis and respiratory infections due to poor glycaemic control, relative immunocompromised state, peripheral neuropathy and autonomic dysfunction [19] . Other studies have reported surgery, orthopaedics and trauma related issues during Hajj [3, 10, 14, 18, 19] . Various psychiatric disorders observed in the study have rarely been reported during Hajj [14, 18] . Extreme heat, overcrowding, physical exertion, dehydration, language barriers, tough living conditions and being in a foreign country for a long duration precipitates stress related problems [3] .",
