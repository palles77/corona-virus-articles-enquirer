            "text": "Diarrhea in kittens is a frequent disorder facing veterinarians and managers of feline shelters and catteries; 1 however, there is scant literature providing specific information on causes and management of this problem. An innumerable number of kittens are abandoned or relinquished shortly after birth to be fostered by 4,000 to 6,000 American animal shelters (Humane Society of the United States report, www .humanesociety.org), and a recent survey of the Association of Shelter Veterinarians identified kitten diarrhea as one of the top two concerns of veterinarians treating shelter cats, second only to upper respiratory infections (K. Hurley, personal communication). Infectious disease was reported by Cave et al. to be the most common cause (55%) of kitten mortality identified from the necropsy findings of 274 kittens from private homes and rescue centers within the United Kingdom, with 25% of kitten mortality being attributed specifically to feline parvovirus (FPV). 2 Knowledge of the most common causes of diarrhea in kittens is integral to formulating appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic plans, as well as guiding the veterinarian when standard therapeutic recommendations fail (Table 1-1) . Diarrhea in kittens is often associated with the effects of stress, 3 dietary intolerance, primary intestinal disease (congenital short colon, intussusception, 4 or inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] ), and infections with enteropathogenic bacteria, viruses, 5 parasites, and protozoa. 6 Although bacterial enteropathogens have been associated with diarrhea in kittens, identifying a causal relationship is difficult because potentially pathogenic enteric organisms can frequently be isolated in clinically healthy kittens. Routine bacterial examination of 57 clinically healthy kittens presented for initial vaccination revealed bacterial enteropathogens and intestinal parasites in 45% of the kittens. 7 These findings were substantiated by a study that documented a significantly higher incidence of Campylobacter spp. in 28% of 54 nondiarrheic cats compared to 10% of 219 diarrheic cats. 8 In addition, this study demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the prevalence of intestinal parasites between diarrheic and nondiarrheic cats. 8 Determination of the frequency of enteropathogens in 100 cats entering an animal shelter in Florida confirmed that cats with diarrhea were no more likely to be infected with one or more (84%) enteropathogen than were cats with normal feces (84%). 9 Only feline coronavirus (FCoV) was significantly more prevalent in cats with diarrhea (58%) compared with cats with normal feces (36%). 9 The high prevalence of enteropathogens in healthy feline populations underscores the challenges faced by veterinarians when trying to attribute causality in diarrheic kittens infected with the same enteropathogens. These studies highlight the importance of establishing practical guidelines for the treatment of the most common and important enteropathogens, as it is challenging and cost-prohibitive to test all shelter cats for all possible infections.",

The procedure should be performed with saline (0.9%) on fresh feces (body temperature, <2 hours old). Trophozoites in older specimens lose their motility, degenerate, and become unrecognizable. The survival of trichomonads can be prolonged by adding 3 mL of 0.9% saline to 2 g of feces. A small amount of feces (size of a match head) is placed on a warm slide and a drop of 0.9% saline is mixed with the feces. Alternatively, a miniscule amount of fresh feces can be collected by insertion of a cotton-tipped swab into the rectum. The smear must not be too thick because trophozoites will be missed easily. A simple rule of thumb is that the observer should be able to read the fine newsprint of a newspaper through the smear.",

T. blagburni should also be distinguished from Giardia spp. Giardia trophozoites have a concave ventral disc and motility that mimics a falling leaf. In contrast, trichomonads are spindle shaped, have an undulating membrane that courses the entire length of the body, and move in a more irregular and jerky fashion. In contrast to Giardia spp., trichomonads do not have a cyst stage, which underscores the limitations of the fecal flotation technique for diagnosis of trichomoniasis. Trichomonads will not survive refrigeration and are rarely found in formed fecal specimens.",

The most commonly diagnosed coccidial infections in cats are Cystoisospora felis and Cystoisospora rivolta (Figure 1-3) . 22 Coccidiosis is typically a disease of puppies and kittens less than 6 months old; parasite recurrence is rare in animals greater than 1 year of age. In most cases, diarrhea, if present, is selflimiting or rapidly responsive to treatment for coccidiosis. 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F) for 24 hours before incubation at room temperature can facilitate an earlier diagnosis because the warmer temperature is more conducive to replication of the trophozoites. Before microscopic evaluation, it is easiest to place the pouch in a plastic clamp provided by the manufacturer that facilitates mounting the pouch onto the stage of a light microscope. Possible reasons for negative fecal culture results include the use of old, desiccated, nondiarrheic, or refrigerated feces in which trophozoites are unlikely to survive; the use of bacteriostatic lubricant to collect the feces; or the placement of excessive feces in the InPouch resulting in overgrowth of bacteria or yeast in the culture medium.",

Giardia PCR fails to amplify DNA from approximately 20% of samples that are positive for Giardia cysts or antigens in other assays. 46 This finding likely results from the presence of PCR inhibitors in feces. PCR should only be used for Giardia if genotyping of the previously detected Giardia spp. is desired to determine the Giardia assemblage. The latter assay can be performed at the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Colorado State University (http://dLab.colostate.edu/).",

Giardia intestinalis assemblages A-H have been defined by DNA sequence analysis so far, of which assemblages A and B are mainly virulent for humans and are often referred to as \"zoonotic assemblages.\" 44 A study comparing mammalian G. intestinalis assemblages studied 13 feline isolates, of which seven were assemblage F, two were assemblage D, three were assemblage A, and one contained both assemblages C and D. 45 These results support the notion that Giardia spp. isolated from infected cats can be zoonotic, although transmission from cats to humans appears to be rare.",

In that study, microscopy following fecal flotation identified only half of the infected dogs and falsely diagnosed up to 25% of uninfected animals. 47 Many veterinarians and reference laboratories have resorted to using ELISA tests that rely upon detection of Giardia cyst wall protein 1 (GCWP 1). 48 The ELISA tests are advantageous because they are generally easy to perform and results are easy to interpret. In addition, the test does not rely upon morphological identification of cysts via microscopy, which saves technician time and potentially avoids false-negative interpretations. The ELISA tests also can detect GCWP 1 in the absence of detectable cysts. 48 However, the SNAP Giardia Test (IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, Maine) is the only commercially available Giardia ELISA assay approved for patient-side testing of giardiasis in dogs and cats. The SNAP Giardia Test is a rapid in-house enzyme immunoassay that can be performed on fresh feces, previously frozen feces, or feces stored at 2\u00b0 to 7\u00b0C (35.6 to 44.6\u00b0F) for up to 7 days. The test has the added advantages of simplicity, rapid availability of results (8 minutes after mixing of the conjugate solution with feces), and low cost. However, such Giardia antigen assays should be supplemental tests because they only detect Giardia spp. and should not replace fecal flotation and wet mount examination to detect a wide variety of intestinal parasites, including Giardia spp. In addition, the Giardia antigen test is best used as a baseline supplemental test to diagnose new infections in animals and should not be used to assess efficacy of therapy because antigen can persist for up to 4 weeks or longer in the absence of Giardia cysts.",

Although testing of human infants is not recommended, data have shown that 26% of children hospitalized with C. difficile infections (CDIs) were younger than 1 year, and 5% were neonates. 54 What cannot be determined from these data are whether the rates of hospitalization for CDIs represent true disease or asymptomatic carriage. C. difficile carriage rates average 37% for infants 0 to 1 month of age and 30% between 1 and 6 months of age. 55 The rate of carriage is similar to that of nonhospitalized adults (0% to 3%) by 3 years of age. It is plausible that neonates and infants may lack the cellular machinery to bind and process the toxins of Clostridium species. This phenomenon is underscored in neonatal puppies that have been shown to have a high incidence of carriage of toxigenic clinical signs of colitis.

Fecal PCR and toxin analysis for specific bacteria should be reserved for (1) kittens that develop diarrhea after kenneling or show attendance once parasitic and viral (feline panleukopenia virus [FPV]) causes for diarrhea have been ruled out, (2) kittens with an acute onset of bloody diarrhea in association with evidence of sepsis, (3) outbreaks of diarrhea occurring in more than one household pet, and (4) screening for enteropathogens (Campylobacter jejuni or Salmonella spp.) when zoonotic concerns are present. The prevalence of five groups of potentially zoonotic enteric infections (Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., and T. cati) in fecal samples from cats under 1 year of age that were either housed in humane shelters or presented to primarycare veterinarians in central New York State was studied. 57 Possible associations of these organisms with the cat's source or with the presence of diarrhea were evaluated. The presence of diarrhea was not significantly associated with the number of organisms identified. Of the 74 cats with diarrhea, 35% (26/74) had one or more types of organisms identified, but of the 189 without diarrhea, 43% (81/189) had one or more types of organisms identified. The proportion of fecal samples with one or more zoonotic organisms was 35.1% among client-owned cats and 44.2% among shelter cats. The prevalence of Salmonella spp. was 0.8%, which is similar to the reported prevalence of Salmonella spp. in cats in Colorado 58 and in kittens from shelters in Japan (1.1%). 59 Campylobacter spp. was isolated from significantly fewer diarrheic (21 of 219 or 9.6%) versus nondiarrheic cats (15 of 54 or 27.8%) in a study evaluating the prevalence of bacterial and parasitic agents in feces from diarrheic and healthy cats from northern California. 8 Caution should be heeded in overinterpreting the isolation of Campylobacter spp. from diarrheic kittens, because many species are nonpathogenic. In addition, fecal cultures are relatively insensitive for isolation of Campylobacter spp. compared with PCR-based testing. In the study by Queen and colleagues 8 only 13.2% of cats were positive for Campylobacter spp. via fecal culture versus 56.5% via PCR. It has been well documented that biochemical and phenotypical characterization of Campylobacter spp. in cat feces is insufficient to characterize the infection. Molecularbased testing allows differentiation of enteric Campylobacter spp. from Helicobacter spp., and also allows identification of multiple Campylobacter spp. in individual animals. 60 Molecular-based testing allows the clinician to detect zoonotic enteropathogens such as Campylobacter jejuni and avoid injudicious antimicrobial therapy for kittens infected with Campylobacter helveticus, an organism of questionable pathogenicity given its high prevalence in healthy cats.",

Because isolation of Campylobacter does not necessarily imply causation of clinical signs, treatment may not be warranted and may further disrupt the intestinal microbiota. However, in immunocompromised or febrile kittens, or in kittens with evidence of hemorrhagic diarrhea, antimicrobial treatment may be indicated. Macrolides and fluoroquinolones are most commonly used to treat Campylobacter infections, although the macrolides are the drugs of choice in light of the increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones observed in people and dogs. Erythromycin administered at 10 to 15 mg/kg PO every 8 hours or azithromycin at 5 to 10 mg/kg PO every 24 hours of 8 cats in groups 1 to 4, respectively, still had a negative result, underscoring the challenges of maintaining a definitive long-term cure in cats naturally infected with Helicobacter spp. A recent study in 13 asymptomatic cats with naturally acquired Helicobacter spp. infection evaluated the efficacy of a quadruple therapy protocol utilizing a regime of omeprazole, amoxicillin, metronidazole, and clarithromycin for 14 days. 73 Molecular analysis of gastric biopsies revealed persistence of Helicobater spp. DNA in four cats that were negative on quantitative urease testing in biopsies, cytology, and histopathology. These results suggest that antibiotic regimes that are effective against H. pylori in people are less effective at eradicating Helicobacter spp. in cats with naturally acquired infection.",

Cats can become persistently infected and continuously or intermittently shed virus with the feces. They generally remain healthy despite systemic infection, indicating that healthy FECV carriers play a key role in the epidemiology of FIP. Feline enteric coronavirus is generally regarded as the avirulent pathotype of FCoV and in older cats oral FECV infection only leads to mild, nonspecific clinical signs such as transient anorexia. However, in young kittens after waning of maternal antibodies, oral FECV infection can induce severe enteritis. There have also been reports of fatal coronavirus enteritis in naturally infected juvenile and adult cats. Affected cats presented with catarrhal to hemorrhagic enteritis, and immunohistopathology confirmed that the virus infected the fully differentiated villous epithelial cells. 85 Infected cats can seroconvert and test positive on FCoV serological testing. Feline coronavirus is commonly detected in healthy and diarrheic cats with a prevalence ranging from 36% to 75%. 6, 7 Interpretation of positive FCoV serological or PCR-based test results must be made cautiously because most cats that are infected with FECV have mild clinical signs, unless the animal is coinfected with other enteropathogens.

A rational understanding of the indications and limitations of different fecal examination techniques is of paramount importance for optimizing the diagnosis of infectious diarrhea in the kitten. Specific fecal examination techniques for the diagnosis of intestinal parasites that should be considered in all diarrheic kittens include the fecal wet mount (direct smear) for motile protozoan trophozoites of Giardia spp. and T. blagburni; fecal flotation via centrifugation for parasitic oocysts, cysts, and ova; acid-fast staining of a fecal smear to assess for the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts; fecal ELISA for Giardia spp.; and fecal DFA for Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. Stained fecal smears using Wright-Giemsa or Diff-Quik to assess feces for endospores, Campylobacter-like organisms, and white blood cells are of limited diagnostic utility. A rectal scraping to evaluate the colorectal mucosa for inflammatory cells, neoplastic cells, or infectious agents can be performed in cats with clinical signs of colitis or dyschezia. Fecal culture for T. blagburni is somewhat time-consuming to perform and is less sensitive than the commercially available fecal PCR. A detailed overview of fecal flotation via centrifugation, fecal culture for enteropathogenic bacteria, fecal immunoassays, and fecal PCR is provided later.

Fecal PCR assays for Giardia can have false-negative results because of PCR inhibitors in feces, and PCR should not be used as a screening procedure for this organism. Large commercial reference laboratories that routinely perform PCR have incorporated a number of controls to ensure quality at each step in the process: quantitative DNA/RNA controls to assess the quality of each clinical sample; extraction controls for every DNA/RNA extraction cycle to ensure the absence of contamination; and internal positive and negative controls to verify each real-time PCR test for optimal performance and the absence of contamination. The primary indication for Giardia spp. PCR is for determining whether the infective species is a zoonotic assemblage. The latter assay can be performed at the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Colorado State University (http://dLab.colostate.edu/). This PCR test is different from the RealPCR Feline Diarrhea Panel (IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, Maine) or the FastPanel PCR Feline GI Profile Panel (Antech Diagnostics, Irvine, California) performed at commercial reference laboratories. PCR can be used to diagnose Cryptosporidium spp. in kittens; however, the author prefers using a DFA test that allows direct visualization of oocysts under a fluorescent microscope. Detection of C. felis and C. canis do not always prove that the agent is the cause of the clinical disease. Fecal PCR testing is recommended for the diagnosis of T. blagburni infection in cats; however, DNA of T. blagburni can be detected in healthy carrier cats and so positive results must be interpreted in the context of the animal's history, physical examination findings, and environment. Polymerase chain reaction is a sensitive method for detecting DNA of Salmonella spp. and Campylo bacter spp., but positive results do not inherently necessitate antimicrobial therapy as discussed previously. In cats, the positive predictive value of Clostridium spp. PCR assays on feces is low, and should best be combined with toxin immunoassays to increase the diagnostic yield. Reverse transcriptase-PCR is used to detect coronavirus RNA in feces; however, positive test results do not differentiate FIPinducing strains from FECV, and the prevalence of coronavirus in healthy, nondiarrheic cats is high.",

It should be recognized that a kitten demonstrating signs of colitis (tenesmus, hematochezia, increased fecal mucus, scant fecal volume with a marked increase in frequency) with evidence of Giardia spp. on fecal flotation or ELISA has another cause for the colitis signs, because Giardia is a small bowel pathogen.

This assay requires a fluorescent microscope and is available at commercial reference laboratories or universities. A variety of highly sensitive and specific CPV antigen tests are commercially available for the detection of FPV; however, antigen shedding can be intermittent thus limiting the sensitivity of the test as a screening tool. Animal shelter veterinarians should select fecal tests for FPV detection that have high sensitivity for FPV and low frequency of vaccine-related test interference. The SNAP Parvo test (IDEXX Laboratories, Westbook, Maine) had the lowest incidence of positive results in sixty-four 8-to 10-week-old specific-pathogenfree kittens inoculated with a modified-live (MLV) or inactivated FPV vaccine. The AGEN CPV (AGEN Biomedical Ltd, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia) and in particular the WITNESS CPV (Synbiotics Corp, San Diego, California) have a much higher frequency of vaccine-related interference. 74 Detection of FeLV antigen is warranted in kittens failing to respond to conventional therapy, although detection of the antigen denotes exposure of the kitten to the virus, but does not prove that clinical disease is due to the virus. The Giardia ELISA test has been validated in both dogs and cats, and is an excellent in-house immunoassay that should be used in conjunction with fecal flotation and wet mounts to increase the diagnostic yield for Giardia spp. Commercially available enterotoxin and toxin ELISAs are available for diagnosis of C. perfringens and C. difficile infections; however, none of the immunoassays have been validated in cats or dogs to date, and caution should be heeded in interpreting these results as these organisms are of dubious pathogenicity. Infectious Diseases Kittens with complicated diarrhea characterized by worsening of clinical signs in the face of hematochezia or melena should undergo fecal testing (PCR or ELISA) for FPV and PCR testing for enteropathogenic bacteria, in particular C. jejuni and Salmonella spp. A complete blood cell count should be done, and the kitten should undergo serological screening for FeLV and feline immunodeficiency virus if this has not been done before. Metronidazole administered for 5 to 7 days should effectively treat C. perfringens and C. difficile, and kittens infected with C. jejuni and showing evidence of systemic clinical signs should be managed with a macrolide antibiotic such as azithromycin at 7 to 10 mg/kg PO every 12 hours for 10 days. Fecal PCR testing can also detect DNA of C. felis, and kittens infected with this protozoan can be treated with azithromycin at the same dose.",

The stress of changing the kitten's environment can exacerbate the diarrhea. The author deworms kittens with simple diarrhea routinely using a broad-spectrum anthelminthic (e.g., fenbendazole) even in the face of a negative fecal flotation or negative Giardia ELISA. Metronidazole administration at 10 to 15 mg/kg PO every 12 hours for 5 to 7 days often is associated with partial to complete amelioration of diarrhea, possibly because of altering the intestinal microbiota, dampening cell-mediated immunity, or activity against a specific pathogen such as C. difficile or C. perfringens. Dietary modification should be considered in kittens that fail to respond to empirical antiparasitic therapy and metronidazole administration. One can temporarily dilute the milk replacer with an oral electrolyte solution such as Pedialyte (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois) to facilitate acclimation to the formula. One can also feed a highly digestible therapeutic intestinal diet for kittens that have been weaned, and there is compelling evidence documenting the benefits of canned therapeutic diets for the management of adult cats with naturally occurring chronic diarrhea. 87 Dietary fat restriction does not appear to be of benefit in adult cats with chronic diarrhea, according to a study that compared the effects of a high-fat (45.1% of calories from fat) versus a low-fat (23.8% of the calories from fat), highly digestible diet. 88 Caution should be heeded in extrapolating the results of these studies in adult cats to kittens, because similar studies have not been undertaken to date. Kittens that fail to improve on a commercial diet can be fed a cooked turkey or chicken diet (without carbohydrates) for 5 to 10 days to provide a highly digestible meal containing moderate amounts of fat. Home-cooked diets are not complete and balanced, and should not be fed to kittens for more than 10 days. Probiotics containing Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus spp., or Bifidobacterium bifidum can be used in kittens with simple diarrhea, and several studies have shown benefit for the use of these nutraceuticals. 89 Kittens that have failed to respond adequately to administration of fenbendazole, metronidazole, and dietary therapy are given a 3-day course of ponazuril at 50 mg/kg PO. The author has observed many diarrheic neonatal kittens diagnosed with Cystoisospora spp. on fecal flotation at 6 weeks of age that had negative fecal flotations at 2 to 3 weeks of age, due to the long incubation period, and intermittent shedding of the parasite is also well documented.

Specifically, gross fecal contamination should be removed as much as possible on a daily basis. Runs should be rinsed with water, after which a layer of disinfectant foam (e.g., Roccal-D Plus) should be applied. After 10 to 20 minutes, the foam should be rinsed away with fresh water. Cages should be sponged clean on a daily basis with a dilute disinfectant or mix of bleach (e.g., Clorox, The Clorox Company, Oakland, California) diluted at 1 : 32 and Quatsyl 256 at 1 : 256. 2.
