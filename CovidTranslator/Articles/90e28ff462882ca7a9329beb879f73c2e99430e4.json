To infer when during animal 24 evolution signaling pathways became associated with cilia, we characterized the proteomes of 25 cilia from three organisms: sea urchins, sea anemones and choanoflagellates. From these 26 ciliomes, we identified 437 high confidence ciliary candidate proteins conserved in mammals, 27 including known regulators of Hh, GPCR and TRP channel signaling. The phylogenetic profiles 28 of their ciliary association indicate that the Hh and GPCR pathways were linked to cilia before 29 the origin of bilateria and TRP channels before the origin of animals. We demonstrated that some 30 of the candidates not previously implicated in ciliary biology localized to cilia and further 31 investigated ENKUR, a TRP channel-interacting protein that we identified in the cilia of all three 32 organisms. In animals, ENKUR is expressed by cells with motile cilia, ENKUR localizes to cilia 33 in diverse organisms and, in both Xenopus laevis and mice, ENKUR is required for patterning 34 the left/right axis. Moreover, mutation of ENKUR causes situs inversus in humans. Thus, 35 proteomic profiling of cilia from diverse eukaryotes defines a conserved ciliary proteome, 36 reveals ancient connections to Hh, GPCR and TRP channel signaling, and uncovers a novel 37 ciliary protein that controls vertebrate development and human disease. 38 39 such as light and chemical cues such as odors (Bloodgood, 2010; Malicki and Johnson, 2016) . 48",

Mutation of Enkur in the 527 mouse did not compromise ciliary beat frequency in tracheal epithelial cells, indicating that, 528 unlike many ciliary proteins with expression patterns and phylogenetic distributions similar to 529 ENKUR (e.g., outer arm dyneins), it is not essential for ciliary motility.

A homologs of PKD1 was detected in the ciliome of sea urchin and 402 an ortholog of PKD2 was detected in the ciliome of sea anenomes (Figure 4B). The localization 403of ENKUR to motile ciliated cells of diverse organisms, as well as its connection to TRP 404 channels, led us to hypothesize that it might play a role in left-right axis patterning. In Xenopus, 405 left-right patterning requires leftward flow generated by motile cilia on the gastrocoel roof plate 406 (GRP) to induce genes such as Pitx2c specifically in the left lateral plate mesoderm(Schweickert  407   et al., 2010).

To determine if ENKUR participates in this step 432 in left-right axis patterning, we examined the expression of Lefty2, a Nodal target gene(Meno et  433   al., 1996). In situ hybridization revealed that in Enkur -/embryos, Lefty2 expression in the lateral 434 plate mesoderm was bilateral, and variably enriched on the left or right side (Figure 6I), 435indicating that ENKUR functions in an early step in left-right axis specification. 436To test if ENKUR is acting upstream of the Nodal signaling pathway in left-right axis 437 patterning, we analyzed the expression of Cerberus like-2 (Cerl2), a secreted protein that 438 antagonizes Nodal(Marques, 2004). In response to nodal fluid flow, Cerl2 is downregulated on 439 the left side of the node(Nakamura et al., 2012). In contrast to littermate control embryos, Enkur -440 /embryos displayed equal, bilateral expression of Cerl2, suggesting that ENKUR may be acting 441 before Nodal signaling is activated, perhaps by generating or sensing leftward nodal flow (Figure 442",

To investigate whether Enkur is expressed in one or both types of nodal cells, we 447 examined Enkur expression in sectioned 2-4 somite stage embryos. Enkur was expressed by 448 nodal pit cells but absent or only weakly expressed by crown cells (Figure 6K).

Like ENKUR, we predict that many of 559 the uncharacterized or poorly characterized proteins present in the ciliomes of all three 560 organisms (e.g., C9orf116, C4orf22, C10orf107, C5orf49) will localize to cilia and have ciliary 561 functions. 562The sea anemone and sea urchin ciliomes share 250 proteins not identified in the 563 choanoflagellate ciliome. Some of these proteins, such as EVC2, have functions associated with 564Hh signaling, a pathway present in many multicellular animals including sea anemones and sea 565 urchins but absent, at least in its canonical form, from choanoflagellates(Adamska et al., 2007). 566 EVC2 is part of a complex comprised of four proteins, EVC, EVC2, IQCE and EFCAB7, each of 567 which were detected in at least one ciliome(Pusapati et al., 2014). Orthologs of the genes 568 encoding these proteins are not present in the choanoflagellate genome, suggesting that they 569 emerged during animal evolution in parallel with the development of ciliary Hh signaling. 570",

            "text": "Pusapati et al., 2014). The identification of EVC3 proteins in cilia suggests that EVC proteins 575 likely have ancient functions at cilia where EVC3 presumably had Hh-independent functions. 576Other known ciliary proteins such as TULP3, a regulator of Hh signaling, were identified 577 exclusively in the sea urchin ciliome. Although homologs of TULPs are present in the genomes 578 of both choanoflagellates and sea anemones, an ortholog of TULP3 is missing, suggesting that 579 the TULP family expanded in animals and TULP3 may be a Deuterostome innovation.580 Beyond Hh signaling components, we detected proteins involved in other pathways, such 581 as GPCR signaling, in the ciliomes of both sea anemones and sea urchins. Homologs of four 582 mouse GPCRs were present in the sea urchin or sea anemone ciliome. In addition to GPCRs, 583 orthologs of multiple G protein components were identified in these ciliomes, including GNAS, 584 GNAQ, GNAO1 and GNB2. The roles of the G protein Transducin in phototransduction at the 585 photoreceptor outer segment (a modified cilium) and of the G protein GNAL in olfaction at the 586 cilia of olfactory sensory neurons are well appreciated (Gie\u00dfl et al., 2004; Kuhlmann et al., 587 2014). The identification of multiple G proteins in the ciliomes of sea anemones and sea urchins 588 suggests that their association with cilia arose early in animal evolution. The co-existence of 589 GPCR and Hh signaling proteins in cilia of early-branching animals may have facilitated the 590 evolution of crosstalk between the two pathways, exemplified by the involvement of the GPCR 591 GPR161, \u03b2-Arrestins and GRKs in mammalian Hh signal transduction (Chen et al., 2011; Evron 592 et al., 2011; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2013; Pal et al., 2016). As the ciliomes contained previously 593identified members of Hh, GPCR and TRP channel signaling, we hypothesize that they also 594 contained unrecognized ciliary regulators of these signaling pathways. 595The ciliomes identified 73 proteins encoded by genes that, when mutated, cause human 596 ciliopathies such as PCD (e.g., HYDIN, CCDC39, TTC25), Bardet-Biedl syndrome (e.g., BBS1, 597 BBS2, BBS3/ARL6), retinal degeneration (e.g., LCA5, ARL3, CLUAP1) and nephronophthisis 598 (e.g., DCDC2A, TRAF3IP1)(Hildebrandt et al., 2011).

Digested plasmid DNA served as template for in vitro transcription with Sp6 1040 (antisense) or T7 (sense) RNA polymerases to generate digoxigenin (DIG) labeled RNA probes 1041 (Roche). For the Lefty2 probe, plasmid was digested with EcoRI and in vitro transcribed using 1042 T7 RNA polymeras. For the Cerl2 probe (IMAGE clone ID 790229), plasmid was digested with 1043 NotI and in vitro transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase. 1044 Embryos were fixed in 4% PFA in PBS for at least 24 hours, transferred to methanol and 1045 stored at -80\u00b0C until use or, if in situ was performed within 2 weeks of dissection, embryos were 1046 stored in fixative at 4\u00b0C. If in methanol (Fig S5 only), embryos were rehydrated to PBST, 1047 bleached with 6% H 2 O 2 for 1 hour, digested with 10\u00b5g/ml proteinase K (Roche) for 8 minutes 1048 and fixed with 4% PFA and 0.2% glutaraldehyde. The embryos were incubated in hybridization 1049 solution (50% formamide, 0.5% CHAPS, 0.2% Tween, 1.3x SSC, 5mM EDTA, 50\u00b5g/ml yeast t-1050 RNA; 700U/ml Heparin) at 65\u00b0C for several hours. Hybridization with the DIG-labeled RNA 1051 probes was performed overnight at 65\u00b0C in hybridization solution. The following day, embryos 1052 were washed two times with fresh hybridization solution for 1hr each, transferred to MABT 1053 (100mM Maleic acid, pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5%Tween) and washed 3 times with MABT for 1054 15 minutes each. After incubating with blocking solution (2% Boehringer Blocking Reagent 1055 (Roche), 20% heat-treated sheep serum in MABT) for 1 hour the embryos were incubated 1056 overnight at 4\u00b0C with AP-anti-DIG antibody diluted in blocking solution. Following 4 washing 1057 steps in MABT for 1 hour each, and 1 wash overnight at 4\u00b0C the embryos were transferred to 1058 NTMT (100mM NaCl, 100 Tris, pH9.5, 50mM MgCl 2 , 0.1% Tween). Color was developed 1059 using NBT/BCIP or MB Purple Substrate (Roche). Embryos were imaged using a Zeiss 1060 Discovery.V12 stereomicroscope and AxioCam MRc camera or a Nikon Digital Sight DS-L3 1061 camera mounted on a Nikon SMZ1000 stereomicroscope.

For HVMA, cells obtained by nasal 1091 brush biopsy were spread on glass slides and immediately ciliary beating was analyzed using the 1092 Haplotype analysis, genome-wide SNP mapping, whole exome sequencing and Sanger 1096 sequencing 1097Haplotype analysis and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping 1098 were performed as previously described (Olbrich et al., 2012) . Exome sequencing of genomic 1099 DNA was performed at the Cologne Center for Genomics (CCG). For enrichment, the 1100 NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library v2.0 was used. Enriched preparations were 1101 sequenced with the HiSeq2000 platform (Illumina) as paired end 2x 100 bp reads. Sequencing 1102 reads that passed quality filtering were mapped to the reference genome sequence (hg19). 1103Variants were analyzed using the varbank software (previously described (Olbrich et al., 2015) ). 1104In addition to the c224-1delG mutation described above (see Results), two other SNPs were 1105 detected in ENKUR that segregated with the disease phenotype (Table S7 ). These SNPs have 1106 allele frequencies of 3% and 5%, indicating that they do not cause rare phenotypes like situs 1107 inversus. PCR amplification of genomic fragments and Sanger sequencing was performed as 1108 previously described (Tarkar et al., 2013) to analyze all ENKUR exons including the exon intron 1109 boundaries (See Table S9 for primers).
