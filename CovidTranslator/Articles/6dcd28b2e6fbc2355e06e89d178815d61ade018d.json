An indirect effect is that alpha-hederin inhibits intracellular uptake of beta 2 receptors and leads to increased beta 2 adrenergic response of the cell. Ivy is often a monopreparation with good safety, compliance, and efficacy in acute and chronic bronchitis. A combination of ivy and thyme (Thymus vulgaris) for acute bronchitis induced a 50% reduction in coughing fits from baseline 2 days earlier than placebo.
