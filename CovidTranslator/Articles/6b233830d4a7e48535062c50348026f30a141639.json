We use a mathematical model to investigate the effectiveness of social distancing interventions lasting six weeks in a middle-sized city in the US. We explore four social distancing strategies by reducing the contacts of adults over 60 years old, adults over 60 years old and children, all adults (25, 75 or 95% compliance), and everyone in the population. Our results suggest that social distancing interventions can avert cases by 20% and hospitalizations and deaths by 90% even with modest compliance within adults as long as the intervention is kept in place, but the epidemic is set to rebound once the intervention is lifted. Our models suggest that social distancing interventions will buy crucial time but need to occur in conjunction with testing and contact tracing of all suspected cases to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",

Three days after, on March 15, the governor of Washington further issued a temporary shutdown of restaurants, bars, and entertainment and recreational facilities [9] .

We calibrated the model to the Seattle, WA metropolitan area and the age distribution of the population using census data [13] . Namely, for each age group, the population is divided into compartments: susceptible S, exposed E (those who have been infected but are not yet infectious), infectious I and removed R (Figure 1 ). Table 1 gives the parameters and ranges used in the model. Based on current estimates [14] that put less than one percent of the infections as asymptomatic, we considered only symptomatic infections. We used the contact matrix for six age groups computed by Wallinga et al. [15] and extend it to ten age groups. A full description of the model can be found in the Appendix. Using genomic epidemiology of the first two cases identified in the state of Washington, Bedford found that by the time that the second case was identified in Washington state, SARS-CoV-2 had been circulating locally for six weeks [16] . Hence, we considered January 21, 2020 (the day the first case was identified) to be the first day of our simulation.",

We considered an epidemic with infectious periods of 5, 6, 7, or 8 days (corresponding to the most plausible values [18, 25] , with all other parameters fixed. When the infectious period is shorter (5 days) the epidemic peaks at 85 days after the introduction of the first case. As the infectious period becomes longer, the epidemic takes much longer to take off ( Figure 2 ). This is because we are keeping a fixed R 0 , so a longer infectious period implies a smaller infectious rate. Indeed, with the longest infectious period, the epidemic peaks 110 days after the first case was introduced. Hence, interventions occurring early on delay the epidemic, but do not substantially change the pool of susceptible individuals, allowing similar-sized epidemics to occur later ( Figure 2 ).",

Social distancing of adults over 60 only delays the epidemic no more than 7 days irrespective of infectious period (Table S1 ).

This corresponds to the approximate date where social distancing interventions started in Washington state. To investigate the sensitivity of the model to the parameters chosen, we ran 1,000 simulations (as described in the Methods). We obtained curves that varied widely over both the number of cases and the duration and timing of the epidemic (figures S1, S2, S3). We show here results of simulations done with the mean values (R 0 = 2.26, an infectious period lasting 5 days and a latent period of 5.1 days). We report cases as well as the proportion of cases, hospitalizations and deaths averted during the first 100 days. While reducing the contacts of adults over 60 only averts only a moderate number of cases (21%, Figure 3 ; and 57% for the adults over 60, Figure S4 )), the number of hospitalizations and deaths are reduced by 36% and 47% respectively for the whole population (Figure 4) , and by 56% for the adults over 60 yo ( Figure S5 ). Adding a social distancing intervention in children drastically slows down the epidemic curve ( Figure 3 ). Further, hospitalizations and deaths are reduced by 75 and 80% respectively, with the reductions evenly distributed across all age groups ( Figures S5 and S6) .",

When adults' contacts are reduced by 75%, all of the interventions but one (where everyone reduces their contacts) rebound immediately after the end of the intervention ( Figure 3B ). As expected, adult groups see the greatest reductions in cases, hospitalizations and deaths from this intervention ( Figures S5B and S6B) . Interestingly, at this rate, the strategy that reduces the contact of adults over 60 and children averts 10% more cases than the strategy that targets adults only (87% vs. 77% cases averted) but they yield similar reductions in hospitalizations and deaths (88 and 86% of hospitalizations averted; 91 and 87% of deaths averted, respectively, Figure 4B ). When adults further reduce their contacts by 95%, both strategies avert over 90% of the hospitalizations and deaths over the first 100 days ( Figure 4C ). Further, once adults reduce their contact rates by 75%, the strategy all mitigates the outbreak (Figures 3B-C , 4B-C, S4B-C-S6B-C).

Here, we used a mathematical model to quantify this term by measuring the short-term number of cases, hospitalization, and deaths averted over the first 100 days under four different social distancing interventions and assuming different levels of compliance in the adult population. When looking at the shortterm impact (here considered to be over the first 100 days) of social distancing interventions started early on in the epidemic, our models suggest that only a social distancing intervention involving all the age groups in the population would considerably decrease the number of cases and delay the epidemic the most. However, with as little as 25% reduction in the contact rates in the adult population (combined with 95% in the older adults), one could reduce the number of hospitalizations and deaths by over 90%. Furthermore, reducing the contact rates of adults over 60 alone can have a considerable impact, reducing hospitalizations and deaths by over 30%, in agreement with what others have found [29] . It is important to interpret our results with caution. As any model, we have made important assumptions that could overestimate the effect of the interventions (see limitations below). Quantifying the short-term impact of an intervention is very important since it allows decision makers to estimate the immediate number of resources needed and to plan for further resources in the long term.",

Our results suggest that social distancing interventions can \"buy us\" several weeks that could prove to be essential to strengthen our health systems and restock medical supplies, but will fail to mitigate the current pandemic. This is in agreement with other modeling results which suggested that very long periods of social distancing would be needed to control transmission [20] . Yet, sustaining social distancing interventions over a period of several months might not be feasible, both economically and socially. A combination of social distancing interventions with testing, isolation and contact tracing of new cases is needed to suppress transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [30] . Further, these interventions need to happen in synchrony around the world, as a new imported case could spark a new outbreak in any given region.",

If the intervention is put in place (and lifted) early on in the epidemic, it results in a delay of the epidemic, but if the intervention occurs later on, then it results in flattening the curve. Indeed, the effectiveness of the intervention will depend on the ratio of the number of susceptible, infected and recovered people in the population at the beginning of the intervention. There is evidence that recovered individuals will have immunity to COVID-19 [31] but it is unclear at this point how long this immunity will last. Recovered individuals would be able to re-enter the work force and help the most vulnerable groups. It is then of paramount importance to have an accurate estimate of the number of current and recovered cases to evaluate possible interventions. As of March 12, 2020, the US had tested fewer than 15,000 CDC samples (in contrast to over 200,000 tests performed in South Korea by mid-March) [32] . It is imperative to expand the testing capabilities in all countries affected.",

Further, deterministic models will always predict a rebound in the epidemic once the intervention is lifted provided that the number of infected people (exposed or infectious) is positive. To avoid that problem, we forced our infected compartments to be zero if they had less than one person infected at any given time. Second, we considered the latent period to be equal to the incubation period, but it has been suggested that pre-symptomatic transmission is occurring [22] , and the virus SARS-CoV-2 is shed for a prolonged time after symptoms end [33] . It is unclear at this point however, if virus shed by convalescent individuals can infect others. Further, we considered that mild and severe cases would be equally infectious. In this sense, our results are conservative. We used mortality and hospitalizations data from China to assess hospitalizations and deaths rates, but these rates will presumably be country-dependent. New information about the epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 is continuously arising, and incorporating such information in mathematical models such as ours is key to provide public health officials with the best tools to make decisions in uncertain times. Taken together, our results suggest that more aggressive approaches need to be taken to mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Social distancing interventions need to occur in tandem with testing and contact tracing to minimize the burden of COVID-19.",

Removed individuals are those who can no longer infect others. The force of infection is represented by \u03bb = 10 j=1 \u03b2 c ij N j I j , where c ij corresponds to the estimated number of contacts per day between age class i and j in a total population size N . Based on current estimates [14] that put less than one percent of the infections as asymptomatic, we considered only symptomatic infections.
