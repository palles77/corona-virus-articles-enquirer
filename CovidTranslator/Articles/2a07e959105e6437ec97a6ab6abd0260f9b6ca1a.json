[1] [2] [3] [4] In 2015, the International Tourism Organization reported 1.2 billion overseas trips. 5, 6 Although most young travelers do well, many develop febrile illnesses during or shortly after their journeys. 7 In a study of European children, 53% of all pediatric patients with travel-related infections were visiting friends and relatives (VFRs), 43.4% were tourists, and 2.4% were immigrants. 8 Most illnesses are selflimited childhood infections that do not require subspecialist consultation. However, 28% of 24,920 ill American travelers sought care at travel clinics after returning home. 9 Additionally, young children with fevers can present a diagnostic dilemma because they may not report symptoms and can be at risk for severe disease, such as malaria. As awareness of tropical illnesses rise in parents, such as the increase in multidrug-resistant bacteria worldwide or the emergence of epidemics with Zika virus in South America, families may be more anxious about serious infections as an etiologic factor of fevers.",

Multidrug-resistant pathogens can also be associated with health care exposure. Up to half of hospitalized children in Zimbabwe are colonized with extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae on admission to the hospital, 12 a problem that is increasingly seen worldwide. Underlying medical conditions, such as asplenia or immunosuppression from chemotherapy, may predispose children to overwhelming infections and sepsis.

            "text": "Plasmodium falciparum malaria is one of the most common tropical infections. Approximately 15% to 20% of all imported malaria cases are diagnosed in the pediatric population in industrialized countries each year. 3 Malaria is transmitted via the nocturnal-feeding Anopheles genus of mosquito. Children who are VFRs are more likely to become infected with malaria than traditional tourists. 3 Nonimmune children are also susceptible to severe malaria from other malaria strains such as Plasmodium vivax 15 and many young patients can present with atypical symptoms such as abdominal pain and vomiting. 16 Older children may present with paroxysmal fever, fatigue, myalgias, headache, abdominal pain, back pain, hepatosplenomegaly, and hemolytic anemia. Additionally, severe malaria is more common in children after the first month of travel due to the incubation period of P falciparum (7-90 days), especially in those who visited sub-Saharan Africa. 17, 18 Overall, sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most common geographic regions for acquisition, comprising 71.5% of cases according to a GeoSentinel study of travelers migrating or returning to Canada from 2004 to 2014. 19 Malaria should remain on the differential diagnosis for up to a year in an acutely ill, febrile child after travel to an endemic area where P vivax and P ovale strains are present. 17 Interestingly, 20% of malaria cases can be acquired during trips as short as 2 weeks with less utilization of pretravel services being a contributing factor. 19 A minimum of 3 thick and thin blood smears must be performed before malaria can be excluded, preferably collected during febrile episodes. The specificity of blood smears is high but the sensitivity can be low depending on the experience of the individual interpreting the slides. 17 Rapid diagnostic tests that detect specific proteins or lactate dehydrogenase are alternatives for diagnosis at medical centers with limited experience in microbiologic evaluation for malaria. 20 The result should be confirmed, however, through the state public health department. In general, a febrile child without a localizing source or splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, or indirect hyperbilirubinemia, in addition to exposure to an endemic area, should be presumptively approached as having malaria until an alternative diagnosis can be made. 21 Treatment of malaria is well-established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. Children with acidosis, hypoglycemia, hyperparasitemia, end-organ dysfunction, and severe anemia meet the criteria for severe malaria and require prompt administration of parenteral medication. There is a growing body of evidence that artesunate may reduce mortality compared with quinidine and is becoming more common as first-line therapy in pediatric patients. 22, 23 Artesunate must be obtained through the CDC Malaria Hotline (1-770-488-7788) because it is not routinely available in the United States. 24 Quinidine may be initiated until the medication arrives. Completion of therapy with an oral regimen for uncomplicated chloroquine-resistant P falciparum, such as atovaquone-proguanil, can be offered when the child is able to tolerate the medications and the parasite burden has decreased to less than 1%. Severe disease is less common in P vivax and P ovale and infection can be treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in most areas outside of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.",

Diarrhea is greater than 2.5 times more common in infants than older children or adults, 25 although constipation can also be seen. Patients can exhibit a Fever in the Returning Traveler typhoid mask with dull features and confusion, as well as a stepladder fever progression with rising temperatures over time in untreated individuals. Relative bradycardia and rose spots are also classic signs. 25 Complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding are more common in young children who have been ill for 2 weeks or more. 1 Transmission is fecal-oral, and humans, especially adults, may be chronic carriers. Diagnosis of enteric fever is confirmed through cultures. The most sensitive sterile site is bone marrow (80%-95%). Blood culture has the highest yield during the first week of illness (70%), and stool cultures are more sensitive as the duration of illness increases. 26 Stool studies should be performed on all fellow travelers, and they must be monitored for signs of illness.

The illness presents as 3 distinct phases: (1) febrile phase over 3 to 7 days characterized by myalgias, headache, retroorbital pain, and rash; (2) critical phase of 24 to 48 days with plasma leakage; and (3) convalescent phase. 32 A rising hemoglobin and gallbladder wall thickening due to increased vascular permeability suggests the development of severe dengue in children. Repeat infections with a different strain may lead to more severe disease. 31 Serologies are most commonly used for diagnosis, although some rapid diagnostic tests are available. In cases in which infection is unclear, it may be helpful to repeat serologies 2 weeks after initial testing to monitor for an increase in titers. Other common laboratory findings include leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. 33 Treatment consists of hydration and avoidance of salicylate-containing products to decrease the risk for bleeding. 32 Children who develop severe dengue with hemorrhage and shock may require blood products.

The differential diagnosis includes typical childhood illnesses, such as roseola or staphylococcal cellulitis, in addition to tropical infections. A study of Canadian travelers from 2009 to 2012 found that cutaneous larva migrans (13%) and skin and soft tissue infections (12.2%) were some of the most common infectious dermatologic complaints among tourists. 47 In countries where vaccination rates are low, varicella zoster virus or rubella may cause disease, especially in young children who have not completed their immunization series. Measles remains an important risk, with tourists comprising 44% of the 94 cases reported to GeoSentinel from 2000 to 2014, and 13% of patients being younger than 18 years of age, although this may represent underreporting due to the surveillance system's primarily adult focus. 48 Petechiae on the extremities in an illappearing child may indicate a serious systemic process such as meningococcal or rickettsial infection. There are many other infections with primarily dermatologic manifestations that may not cause fevers ( Table 7) . 49 ",
