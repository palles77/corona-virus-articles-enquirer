            "text": "In their Letter to the Editors, Hayasaka et al. 2 commented on the decreasing number of public health centres (PHCs) in contemporary Japan. However, this may be an oversimplification of current events. The integration of PHCs in Yokohama City during 2007, for example, involved the amalgamation of 18 centres into one, although the new facility actually contained 18 branches. 3 Hayasaka et al. 2 also commented on a decreasing number of public health professionals now working in Japanese PHCs. However, this may only be part of the story, as statistics from the Japanese Nursing Association suggest that the number of public health nurses has been increasing since 1997, with approximately 47,000 in service in 2005. 4 While Hayasaka et al. 2 pointed out that PHCs were first established following promulgation of the 1947 Community Health Law, the origins of Japanese public health can be traced back much further than this. The first Japanese healthcare legislation was enacted in 1874, followed 1 year later by establishment of the Bureau of Public Health in 1875. The first Public Health Centre Act was introduced in 1937, before being amended in 1947 and again in 1994, when it became the Regional Health Act. 5 This revised legislation was part of an overall restructuring process intended to delegate various PHC services to municipal health centres (MHCs). The number of MHCs has been increasing; in late 2005, there were 2692 MHCs in Japan. 5 Despite some potential caveats, the point made by Hayasaka et al. is still of vital importance. The Japanese success story in reducing disease and simultaneously raising the life expectancy of its citizens to record levels is no doubt a credit to its dedicated public health workforce. Similarly, the maintenance of high public health standards in Japanese society, as elsewhere, is critical as we enter a new era of potentially devastating epidemics, such as pandemic influenza, avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome. Any reduction in public health resources or manpower which might compromise our ability to respond effectively to these challenges must be actively resisted. As Hayasaka et al. point out, PHCs serve a very important role in the immediate response to infectious disease outbreaks in contemporary Japanese society. 2 PHCs also offer a variety of preventive services for healthy citizens, including periodical medical examinations and various gender-specific, cancer screening services for both men and women.",

            "text": "However, for all its noteworthy achievements, Japanese society still faces important challenges as we pass through the first decade of the 21st Century. Suicide, for example, has now emerged as a serious public health issue. Approximately 30,000 Japanese take their own lives each year 1 ; the highest age-adjusted suicide rate of any industrialized country. 5 Death from overwork represents another unique Japanese health phenomenon that was first coined in 1978 and has since been recognized internationally. 6 Structural changes in society have also been occurring, with Japan's rapidly ageing population and declining birth rate representing a major social issue for future generations. In 2005, the country suffered its first overall decrease in population, whereby the number of deaths actually surpassed the number of births. Crude fertility rates have now hit record lows, far below replacement levels. 5 Another very important, although often overlooked, public health issue is the continued high rate of smoking among Japanese males; a habit which even extends to certain health professionals. 7 In meeting these challenges, it will be necessary to mobilize and coordinate all of Japan's public health resources in the new millennium. While PHCs have no doubt served a very important role in shaping the country's health, enhanced cooperation among the entire Japanese healthcare workforce is clearly required, be they doctors, nurses or allied health professionals working in PHCs, MHCs or elsewhere. Only with a united focus and vision can Japan, or any other country, be expected to successfully address its emerging threats to public health.",
