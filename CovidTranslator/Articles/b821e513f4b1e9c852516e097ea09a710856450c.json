In concordance with this study, Ang II was able to up-regulate ACE and down-reg ulate ACE2 in human kidney tubular cells. These effects were blocked by an AT1 receptor antagonist (losartan), but not by an AT2 receptor blocker (PD123319) [ 26\u2022 ]. Furthermore, blockade of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) or p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases by either specifi c inhibitors or a dominant-negative adenovirus abolished Ang II-induced ACE2 down-regulation in human kidney tubular cells [ 26\u2022 ] .",

Also, at-RA affects regulation of the stem cell marker octomer-4 (Oct-4) and eventually, cellular differentiation. Zulli et al.

            "text": "In the heart, Ang II receptor blockers have been shown to increase ACE2 protein and gene expression in different models of experimental hypertension [ 34 , 35\u2022 , 36 ]. In the model of myocardial infarction after left coronary artery ligation and in transgenic Ren-2 rats, the ACE inhibitors enalapril and lisinopril increased heart ACE2 expression [ 31 , 35\u2022 ] . In the thoracic aorta of male SHR, ACE2 was increased in association with reversal of vascular hypertrophy in response to olmesartan treatment [ 32 ] . In a study by Whaley-Connell et al. [ 37 ] that examined glomerular fi ltration barrier injury in the Ren-2 transgenic rat, AT1 receptor blockade was associated with increased ACE2 expression. These changes were not observed in atenolol-or hydralazine-treated hypertensive rats [ 32 ] . Taken together, these fi ndings suggest that ACE2 is regulated by AT1 receptors and may be involved in mediating the pressure-independent vascular remodeling effects of Ang II blockers [ 32 ] .",

These results suggest that ACE2 plays an important role in regulating the hypertrophic response to pressure overload mediated by Ang II. In a study by Oudit et al.

Our laboratory showed that telmisartan increases ACE2 protein expression in the renal vasculature [ 30 ] . It is unknown if this action is related, in part, to the wellknown peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) effect of telmisartan [ 40 ] . The PPARs are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. In particular, PPAR-\u03b3 plays a critical role in regulating carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms. PPAR-\u03b3 ligands have modest antihypertensive effects related to their ability to promote peripheral vasodilation, improve insulin sensitivity, and decrease the risk for atherosclerosis [ 41 ] . The Ang II receptor blocker telmisartan is structurally similar to a PPAR-\u03b3 agonist. In fact, telmisartan treatment in vitro augmented PPAR-\u03b3 activity. Recently Kobayashi et al. [ 42 ] showed that in Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats, telmisartan stimulates nitric oxide production through PPAR-\u03b3 and the Rho-kinase pathway. It also ameliorated cardiac hypertrophy and cardiovascular remodeling. A direct effect of PPARs on ACE2 expression has not been studied, but they could function in synergism with Ang II receptor blockers.",

            "text": "Although the foregoing studies suggest that indirect ways exist to infl uence ACE2 activity pharmacologically, namely by using agents that affect the RAS, there is an interest in exploring and developing agents that are primarily inhibitors or activators of ACE2. [ 13\u2022 ] found increased albuminuria, glomerular mesangial expansion, and vascular thickness after MLN-4760 treatment. Our fi nding of increased albuminuria in two models of diabetic mice treated with an ACE2 inhibitor suggests a role of this enzyme in regulating Ang II-mediated glomerular permeability. In agreement with this, Tikellis et al. [ 43\u2022 ] recently found that in STZ-treated mice, albuminuria was increased after MLN-4760 administration for 4 weeks. ACE2-knockout diabetic mice using STZ experienced a 5.2-fold increase in urinary albumin excretion when compared with untreated ACE2-knockout mice [ 43\u2022 ] . Surprisingly, ACE2 inhibition was able to attenuate diabetes-associated changes in osteopontin expression and glomerular fi bronectin accumulation [ 43\u2022 ] . The dissociation between the effects on albuminuria and fi brogenesis after ACE2 inhibition is unexpected, and both fi ndings are diffi cult to reconcile. Tikellis et al. [ 43\u2022 ] suggested that the decrease in fi bronectin deposition was possibly related to a decrease in renal ACE activity in animals treated with the selective ACE2 inhibitor. The decrease in ACE activity observed by these authors was previously reported in kidney cortex from STZ diabetic mice treated with MLN-4760 [ 13\u2022 ]. However, it must be noted that glomeruli from diabetic mice treated with MLN-4760 had an increase in ACE expression [ 13\u2022 ]. In contrast, ACE2 expression is decreased (not increased) in kidney cortex, which is mostly composed of proximal tubules [ 15\u2022 ]. Another interesting fi nding from Tikellis et al. [ 43\u2022 ] is that perindopril reduced renal cortical ACE2 activity in both control and diabetic animals. Although the interaction of ACE and ACE2 appears complex and is not fully understood, ACE2 protein and activity may be infl uenced by the level of ACE protein and activity, and vice versa.",

Kidney Int 2006, 70: 34-41. These researchers examined the developmental expression of ACE2 in the rodent kidney and its temporal expression, as it relates to hypertension development in the SHR model. The developmental pattern of ACE2 expression in the SHR kidney is altered before hypertension onset, consistent with the key role of the RAS in the pathogenesis of adult-onset hypertension. 15.\u2022 Wysocki J, Ye M, Soler MJ, et al. : ACE and ACE2 activity in diabetic mice. Diabetes 2006, 55: 2132-2139. Investigators developed a microplate-based fl uorometric method for concurrent determination of ACE and ACE2 activity in tissue samples. Results showed that ACE2 expression is increased at the posttranscriptional level in kidney cortex from diabetic mice. The availability of an assay for concurrent measurement of ACE and ACE2 activity should be helpful in evaluating kidneyspecifi c alterations. 16.\u2022\u2022 Ye M, Wysocki J, William J, et al. : Glomerular localization and expression of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and Angiotensin-converting enzyme: implications for albuminuria in diabetes. J Am Soc Nephrol 2006, 17: 3067-3075. This study showed the localization of ACE2 in the podocyte and mesangial cells and ACE in the endothelial cells in mouse glomeruli. Diabetic db/db mice have decreased glomerular expression of ACE2 and increased ACE expression. In addition, chronic pharmacologic ACE2 inhibition was associated with increased albuminuria that could be prevented by telmisartan, an Ang II type 1 blocker. 17.

Am J Pathol 2007, 171: 438-451. This study examined the effect of ACE2 ablation in the Akita model of diabetic nephropathy. Mice lacking ACE2 were crossed with Akita mice, resulting in a model with increased urinary albumin excretion and glomerular pathology. Moreover, treatment with an Ang II receptor blocker reduced urinary albumin excretion rate in the diabetic ACE2 knockout mice, suggesting that acceleration of kidney injury in these mice is Ang II mediated. 22.
