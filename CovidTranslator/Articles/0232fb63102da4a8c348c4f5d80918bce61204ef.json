            "text": "Control of infectious diseases is essential for the production of healthy poultry flocks and this is generally achieved by extensive vaccination programmes in combination with good management practices including biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of infection. The success of vaccination programmes depends on the ability of the birds to mount a vigorous immune response after vaccination. In addition to the innate ability of a particular bird to mount an immune response to a vaccine or an infection there are numerous external factors influencing the level of protective immunity. The purpose of this chapter is to review the mechanisms, and impact of immunosuppression, which can have multiple causes, and the ability of pathogens to counteract immune responses by immunoevasion. Immunosuppression is defined as \"A state of temporary or permanent dysfunction of the immune response resulting from insults to the immune system and leading to increased susceptibility to disease\" as originally proposed by Dohms and Sail (1984) with the addition of \"and often a suboptimal antibody response\" as suggested by Liitticken (1997) . Such dysfunction often results from infection of cells of the immune system, leading to their impaired function against the primary and subsequent infections, in a non-specific manner. For this chapter, we define immunoevasion as \"Pathogeninitiated responses counteracting the immune responses to the specific pathogen\". The major difference is that immunosuppression is the consequence of the overall replicative strategy of the causative agent, resulting in increased susceptibility to other pathogens but not necessarily to the causative agent, while immunoevasion is achieved by specific pathogen-encoded determinants, primarily favouring replication of the causative agent. In some instances, infections can result in immunosuppression and immunoevasion, e.g. infection with Marek's disease virus (MDV) .",

            "text": "Immunosuppression is a major problem for the poultry industry but actual figures indicating the scale of the problem are hard to find. Infection with pathogens and/or environmental factors, including management errors, can result in immunosuppression and interactions between the two usually exacerbate the problem. Any infection causing clinical disease may result in immunosuppression, but the focus will be on pathogen-induced immunosuppression in the absence of clinical disease. Viruses causing immunosuppression and/or clinical disease at any age include MDV, reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV), reovirus, and, although controversial, avian leukosis virus (ALV). Other pathogens, e.g. chicken infectious anaemia virus (CIAV), may cause clinical disease in young chicks but the major damage consists of subclinical infection causing immunosuppression. Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) also causes clinical disease in young chicks, but this acute infection results in damage to immune tissue, particularly the bursa of Fabricius and bursa-derived lymphocytes, compromising the host's ability to mount effective responses upon subsequent infection by other pathogens. Caution is needed, however, in the interpretation of the immunosuppressive effects caused by reovirus, MDV, REV, and IBDV especially with older studies, because it is not always clear if these viruses were free of CIAV. For example, Jakowski et al. (1970) reported haematopoietic tissue destruction in chickens with Marek's disease (MD), but it was later learned that tumour material harvested from these birds was positive for CIAV (Wellenstein, personal communication, cited by Schat, 2003) . In addition to viral infections, coccidial infections have been linked to immunosuppression.",

A classic example is the study by Gross (1972) in which MDV-exposed chickens were kept in a socially stressful environment by moving every day one chicken from one cage into another cage. These chickens developed a higher incidence of tumours than the MDV-infected chickens kept in a low stress environment. The effects of social stress on MD were especially enhanced in birds selected for high plasma corticosterone concentrations. Inoculation with chemicals blocking 11-13 hydroxylase, which mediates the conversion of deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone in the adrenal glands, reduced the impact of social stress on MD and other diseases (Gross, 1972 (Gross, , 1989 . Inoculation of chickens with corticosterone using pharmacological doses resulted in a rapid lymphoid depletion in thymus, bursa, and spleen (Dohms and Metz, 1991) . These authors suggested that bacterial infections (e.g. Escherichia coli) may cause stress-type lesions in the bursa similar to corticosterone-induced lymphoid depletion.",

Aflatoxin is the best known fungal stressor for poultry but fumonisins and ochratoxins have also been implicated as immunotoxicants in chickens and turkeys. Bondy and Pestka (2000) suggested that the effects are more immunomodulatory than immunosuppressive but the molecular basis for the immunomodulation is poorly understood. Ingestion of aflatoxins can result in decreased antibody responses to T cell-dependent and -independent antigens, decreased macrophage functions, and decreased cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses, but these effects are dose-dependent (Bondy and Pestka, 2000) . Chicks hatched from hens fed on diets containing aflatoxins also showed impaired immune functions when tested between 2 and 3 weeks of age (Qureshi et al., 1998) , but it is not known how long after hatching the effects last. These results have important implications and can confound the interpretation of immune dysfunctions in commercial flocks as a confounding factor when virally induced immunosuppression occurs in young birds. Feed contaminated with fumonisins and ochratoxins also impairs antibody responses and macrophage functions, but it is not clear if immunosuppression occurs in chicks hatched from hens fed contaminated diets (Bondy and Pestka, 2000) .",

            "text": "Two groups of coccidian species have been linked to immunosuppression, Cryptosporidium baileyi and Eimeria spp., although the evidence is rather limited in both cases. Infection with the latter has been linked to decreased mitogen stimulation responses (Rose and Hesketh, 1984) , but antibody responses to T cell-dependent and -independent antigens were not affected (Bhanushali and Long, 1985) . C. baileyi replicates in the epithelial cells of the bursa of Fabricius and respiratory tract of chickens and is probably more prevalent than diagnostic cases indicate (McDougald, 2003) . Oral inoculation of young chickens with high doses of C. baileyi caused histopathological lesions in the epithelium and lamina propia of the bursa (Rhee et al., 1997) and decreased antibody responses to T cell-dependent and -independent antigens (Rhee et al., 1998b (Rhee et al., , 1998c . Titres to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) were also decreased after inoculation of 2-day-old chicks with C. baileyi. (Rhee et al., 1998a (Rhee et al., , 1998d . On the other hand, Abbassi et al. (2000a Abbassi et al. ( , 2000b found that infection with C. baileyi neither increased MD nor did it reduce the efficacy of the MDV vaccine strain CVI988. Interestingly, MDV infection before or after challenge with C. baileyi aggravated the latter. Likewise, MDV vaccination followed 4 days later with C. baileyi challenge caused respiratory lesions within 6 days (see also section MDV).",

Segment B codes for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and segment A codes for two structural proteins, VP2 and VP3, an autoprotease, VP4, and a small non-structural peptide, VP5, which partly overlaps with the open reading frame (ORF) coding for VP234 (Lukert and Saif, 2003) . The polyprotein VP234, but not the mature VP2, VP3 or VP4, arrests B cell division probably by interfering with the cell cycle, because it does not affect cell viability (Peters et al., 2004) . Using a reverse genetics approach, Yao et al. (1998) showed that deletion of VP5 did not prevent virus replication in vivo but did prevent the development of bursal lesions suggesting a role for VP5 in the pathogenesis. Interestingly, in vitro studies suggest that very early after infection VP5 is anti-apoptotic (Liu and Vakharia, 2006) , but during later stages VP5 accumulates in the plasma membrane (Lombardo et al., 2000) and causes apoptosis (Yao and Vakharia, 2001) . VP2 has also been linked to apoptosis when expressed alone from transfected RNA (Rodriguez-Lecompte et al., 2005) . In summary, the molecular basis for IBDV-induced suppression of the immune response is the result of a complex set of interactions between the different viral proteins and infected B cells.",

            "text": "It has been known since the 1970s that IBDV infection in chicks younger than 3 weeks of age causes severe damage to the bursa of Fabricius with depletion of B cells expressing surface immunoglobulin (Ig)M affecting mostly primary antibody responses. Infection, especially at 1 day of age, also results in a significant decrease of surface Ig-expressing B cells in spleen and peripheral blood lymphocytes but does not affect circulating CD4 \u00a7 and CD8 \u00a7 T cells (Hirai et al., 1981; Rodenberg et al., 1994) . The damage to the bursa is transient, follicles become repopulated with lymphocytes and tissue architecture is restored, but primary antibody responses remain depressed until at least 7 weeks post-infection (pi), but ultimately also recover. The duration of the recovery process depends on the age of infection and the virulence of the strain (Vervelde and Davison, 1997; Kim et al., 1999) . Recently, Withers et al. (2005 described two t~cpes of follicles emerging after recovery from IBDV infection in neonatal chicks: small follicles lacking a distinct cortex and medulla and large follicles with rapidly proliferating B cells and a normal structure. B cells in the large follicles were still capable of undergoing gene conversion and may have been derived from small numbers of surviving bursal stem cells. In contrast, the B cells in the small follicles were considered to be derived from more mature B cells that had already undergone gene conversion. These data suggest that the ability to recover from IBDV-induced suppression of antibody production and diversity is based on the proportion of small versus large follicles developing after infection.",

(2005) found viral RNA and proteins by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively, in bursal macrophages between 1 and 7 days pi. The absolute number of macrophages in the bursa was decreased significantly at 3 and 5 days pi. The actual impact on the immune response of this observation is not clear. Proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1~3, and IL-8 are increased at the transcriptional level in the bursa and spleen, while the anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-~34 is decreased (Kim et al., 1998; Khatri et al., 2005; Eldaghayes et al., 2006) . These different groups of authors reported somewhat conflicting results for the production of type I interferon (IFN) and IFN-~ transcription, but these differences could be the result of using different virus strains and/or infecting different age groups. In addition, the production of nitric oxide synthase II -NOS II, previously known as inducible NOS (iNOS) (Bruckdorfer, 2005) -mRNA was also increased in bursal macrophages. Khatri and Sharma (2006) showed that the activation of macrophages is through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF~3) pathway, but it is not clear whether these pathways are activated through specific viral proteins. The alterations in cytokine transcription are compatible with the inflammation in the bursa during the acute infection. However, it is less clear how these changes play a role in IBDV-associated immunosuppression. It will also be important to determine if the changes occur in IBDV-infected macrophages before they undergo lysis or that infection and cytokine deregulation occur in different subpopulations.",

Recent studies by several groups have provided a better insight in the immunopathogenesis of IBDV in young birds. However important questions remain. For example, how can we explain the recovery from infection in the face of suppression of primary antibody responses, if neutralizing antibodies are key to recovery? Do we have to postulate that cell-mediated immunity is far more important than previously believed? Another unresolved question is why young birds mostly develop subclinical disease, while infection of older, antibody-negative birds results in clear-cut pathology including haemorrhages. There may be similarities between the situation in birds with IBDV and in mice with influenza virus, where the immune response is responsible for most tissue damage and in which case the damage can be reduced by treatment with TGF-3 (Williams et al., 2005) .",

Dividing cells that are susceptible to infection are haemocytoblasts in the bone marrow, T cell precursors in the thymus or dividing T cells in response to antigenic stimulation. VP3 or apoptin is the most important protein for immunosuppression by causing apoptosis of infected haemocytoblasts, resulting in a decrease in erythrocytes, thrombocytes, and granulocytes. The loss of the latter two cell types is important because thrombocytes and granulocytes are both important effector cells during bacterial infections and secondary bacterial infections (e.g. \"blue-wing disease\") are frequently associated with CIAV-induced immunosuppression. AcJair et al. (1993) reported that CD3+CD8+TCR(~3 spleen cells constitute the major CIAV-infected population in the spleen. The effect of virus replication in these cells is especially important when replication of CIAV occurs at the same time that cytotoxic T cells (CTL) are generated in response to vaccination or infection with a second pathogen. Markowski-Grimsrud and Schat (2003) reported the absence of REV-specific CTL 7 days after birds were co-infected with REV and CIAV, at which time point CIAV was actively replicating, based on real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Because there was no effect of CIAV infection on transcription of IL-2 or IFN-'~ at 7 days pi it was suggested that the lack of pathogen-specific CTL was caused by CIAV-induced apoptosis of CD8 + cells during the generation of CTL. In contrast to the effect on CTL, natural killer (NK) cells were not affected by CIAV infection . Based on the studies in MSB-1 cells, Peters et al. (2006) recently suggested that VP2 may also play a role in immunosuppression through downregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens. The importance of this observation for immunosuppression is difficult to evaluate because the assumption is that CIAV-infected cells will become apoptotic.",

More recently quantitative RT-assays have been used to investigate the effects of CIAV infection on cytokines in relation to virus replication. Unfortunately, the few published studies have not included the effect of virus replication prior to 7 days pi, when high levels of virus replication occur (Markowski-Grimsrud and Schat, 2003; van Santen et al., 2004) . At that time, immunosuppressive effects are already evident with impairment of macrophages and CTL (Markowski-Grimsrud and Schat, 2003) , but IFN-% IL-2 and IL-I~ mRNA levels were not affected (Markowski-Grimsrud and Schat, 2003) . Clearly, additional studies using quantitative RT-PCR assays or enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) are needed to determine the impact of CIAV infection on cytokines starting at 2-3 days pi, because viral antigens can be detected in lymphoid tissues and bone marrow as early as 3-4 days pi (Smyth et al., 1993) . Interestingly, the damage to the thymus and bone marrow was quite extensive between 3 and 12 days pi though relatively few cells in these organs were positive for viral antigens. The collapse of the thymus is probably the result of damage to the cytokine network needed for T cell maturation. Detailed studies on early cytokine changes during CIAV infection are essential to gain an understanding of the subsequent immunosuppression.",

            "text": "Avian reoviruses belong to the orthoreovirus genus of the Reoviridae, which have a genome consisting of 10 dsRNA fragments. Avian reovirus infections can cause tenosynovitis in chickens and other diseases, or result in a subclinical infection. Although horizontal transmission is the main route for infection, egg transmission may occur infrequently (Menendez et al., 1975) . Infections with pathogenic, but not non-pathogenic, strains have been associated with depletion of lymphoid cells in the bursa and thymus and decreased serological responses to inactivated NDV (Sharma and Fredericksen, 1987) . However, Montgomery et al. (1986) were unable to find a significant impact of reovirus infection on antibody responses to NDV, sheep red blood cells (SRBC), and Brucella abortus antigen, although a decrease in relative bursa weight and some lymphocyte depletion in the bursa were noted. Reovirus infection decreased the responses of peripheral blood monocytes and splenocytes to mitogens at 7 days pi but not afterwards (Montgomery et al., 1986; Sharma et al., 1994; Pertile et al., 1995 Pertile et al., , 1996 . The latter group showed that removal of plastic-adherent cells primed to produce NO restored mitogen responsiveness of T lymphocytes to some degree and suggested that suppressor macrophages were responsible for the immuno-suppression. Recent work with mammalian species suggests that the regulation of macrophage activation is rather complex. For example, IL-13 may be responsible for the induction of macrophages producing NO (Sinha and Garg, 2000) while IL-10, through the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3), may downregulate the inflammatory responses of macrophages (Qasimi et al., 2006) . The $1 genome segment of avian and mammalian reovirus, which has been linked to immunosuppression (Garzelli et al., 1985) , codes for 3 open reading frames (ORF) two of which are non-structural proteins. These two proteins have pleiotropic functions, many of which interfere with cellular signaling pathways (Liu et al., 2005) . Additional research on the interactions of these proteins with cytokine pathways will be important to more fully understand reovirus-induced immunosuppression in chickens.",

The increase in pathogenicity not only increased the incidence of tumours but was also linked to some new neurological syndromes (Gimeno et al., 2002) .

MDVassociated immunosuppression is often divided into an early immunosuppression phase during the cytolytic infection and a late immunosuppression phase, when virus is reactivated and tumours develop. One of the key characteristics of the early immunosuppression is the destruction of lymphocytes in the lymphoid organs during the first 2 weeks of infection causing severe atrophy of the thymus and bursa of Fabricius; this may be permanent or transient depending on the pathotype of MDV. The model for the pathogenesis of MD, as originally outlined by Calnek (1986) and Schat (1987) and recently reviewed by Calnek (2001) , provides the basis for the understanding how MDV causes both B and T cell depletion. Briefly, chickens become infected through cell-free virus present in feather-follicle dander. Virus is transferred to the lymphoid organs probably through macrophages and replicates first in B lymphocytes causing a productive-restrictive infection in which cell-associated but not cell-free MDV is produced and the infected cells are destined to die. This phase is often referred to as the cytolytic phase. As a consequence of the production of viral antigens and subsequent immune responses, T cells become activated expressing MHC class II antigens and other activation markers. In contrast to resting T cells, activated T cells are susceptible to MDV infection and become infected. Normally, MDV establishes a latent infection in activated T cells through poorly understood mechanisms (Morgan et al., 2001b) , although cytokines most likely play a role in the process . Depending on the pathotype of MDV and the genetic resistance of the host, latency may be permanent, temporarily followed by a secondary cytolytic cycle, additional immunosuppression and tumour development, or absent with continuous virus replication and, frequently, early mortality.",

The upregulation of IL-8 receptors is likely an essential step in the transfer of cellassociated MDV from B cells to activated T cells, allowing viral IL-8 (VIL-8) produced during the lytic infection to attract activated T cells. The increased cytolytic infection, and thus increased damage to the lymphoid organs associated with some of the vv+ pathotypes, may be caused by a more effective transfer of MDV from B to T cells due to increased levels of vlL-8 production combined with the inability to establish latency after 7 days pi. Jarosinski et al. (2003) reported that vv+ strains produced higher levels of vlL-8 than less virulent strains, but this is likely the consequence of increased virus replication (Yunis et al., 2004) rather than an intrinsic ability to enhance vlL-8 production. The importance of vlL-8 for the cytolytic infection is further shown by the fact that tissue culture-attenuated strains have no or very low vlL-8 transcript levels (Jarosinski et al., 2003) and that deletion of vlL-8 (Cortes and Cardona, 2004; Cui et al., 2005) or deletion of exon 1 of vlL-8 (Jarosinski and Schat, 2007) result in attenuation of the cytolytic infection. The reasons for the continued replication of vv+ MDV instead of establishment of latency have not been elucidated. It is of interest to note that vv+ MDV causes a highly significant upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines as early as 4 days pi in spleen and brain tissues (Jarosinski et al., 2005; Careem et al., 2006) . It is certainly feasible that the distortion in cytokine profile impacts on the production of cytokines involved in the induction and/or maintenance of latency (Volpini et al., 1995) with the consequence of a prolonged cytolytic infection leading to more profound immunosuppression.",

What needs to be resolved is: do MDV-infected thymocytes become apoptotic or does MDVinduced cytokine deregulation affecting thymocyte maturation cause apoptosis of non-infected cells and a collapse of thymus architecture (Schat, 2004 )? The latter is certainly possible, based on the recent evidence that cytokines can be deregulated especially after infection with vv+ strains. MDV infection can also cause apoptosis in CD4 \u00a7 peripheral T cells, but CD8 \u00a7 T cells are apparently not affected (Morimura et al., 1995) . The reasons for the latter are not clear because CD8 \u00a7 T cells can be infected with and transformed by MDV (Baigent et al., 1998; Calnek et al., 1989) . Thus far, it has not been resolved which MDV gene products are responsible for the immunsuppression. It is likely that the SORF2 gene plays a role, based on two studies using opposing experimental strategies. Deletion mutants lacking several ORF, including SORF2, caused decreased cytolytic infection without preventing tumour formation (Parcells et al., 1995) . Upregulation of SORF2 expression through the insertion of the REV long terminal repeat (LTR) resulted in enhanced cytolytic infection in the absence of tumour development .",

E. coli-caused mortality was increased in vaccinated chicks independently of the MDV vaccine used, when challenged at 11 or 14 days post-vaccination, but only occurred in chicks vaccinated with CVI988 when these were challenged at 21 days post-vaccination. Islam et al.

Vaccination with CVI988 also precipitated lesions when chicks were challenged with C. baileyi 4 days post-vaccination (see section Coccidia-Induced Immunosuppression). The importance of vaccine-induced immunosuppression is not clear in commercial flocks and is far less important than the protection against MD challenge. The possibility that in ovo vaccination with HVT might induce tolerance was investigated by Zhang and Sharma (2003) . Inoculation between 0 and 14 days of embryonation-induced tolerance to HVT but not to BSA. In contrast vaccination at 18 days of embryonation, which is the approximate time for in ovo vaccination, did not induce tolerance to HVT.",

ALV-J was first described during the late 1980s and is mostly associated with meat-type birds. ALV and REV can also be divided into defective viruses and non-defective (nd) or helper viruses.

Chicks hatched from congenitally-infected eggs are tolerant and unable to produce VN antibodies to the virus. These chickens will be viraemic, antibody negative (V+A-) and are likely to develop tumours or in the case of REV tumours and/or runting and stunting. Horizontal transmission during, or shortly after, hatching can also result in tolerance. This risk is enhanced in chicks when subgroup E or glycoprotein (gp)85 of subgroup E is expressed during embryonal development (Smith et al., 1991) or after IBDV infection at 1 day or 6 weeks of age. IBDV infection decreased the frequency of VN antibody-positive chickens, and increased virus shedding and viraemia levels significantly, although these effects were dependent on the genetic background of the birds. In contrast infection with REV at 1 day of age or MDV at 2 weeks of age had no significant impact on ALV shedding, viraemia, and antibody development (Fadly et al., 1985) . The induction of tolerance after congenital infection is virus specific and is not a general inability to produce antibodies against other pathogens than ALV or REV. For example, chickens congenitally infected with a specific strain of ALV-A were able to produce antibodies to other subgroup A strains (Meyers, 1976) and influenza virus, but were partly tolerant to ALV-B (Meyers and Dougherty, 1971) .",

At least theoretically, this could have important practical consequences, because REV infection has often been linked to the use of contaminated MD vaccines (Koyama et al., 1976; Jackson et al., 1977) . Fowlpox viruses (FPV) can carry replication competent REV genomes, which may be expressed in vivo (Diallo et al., 1998) potentially causing immunosuppression. REV infection decreased antibody responses to HVT, MDV, and NDV (e.g. von Biilow, 1977; Yoshida et al., 1981) . In contrast, Fadly et al. (1985) and Witter et al. (1979 Witter et al. ( , 1981 found only decreased primary antibody responses to SRBC and Brucella abortus, and no effect on MDV antibodies, although protective immunity to MD was decreased and ALV infection levels were increased in a commercial line. Embryo inoculation with the T strain, but not with the Cornell C strain (CS) strain, impaired also the secondary immune responses to SRBC and Brucella abortus. The effect of REV infection on MDV was questioned by Buscaglia et al. (1989) because REV infection did not impair the establishment of MDV latency or reactivation from latency. These authors suggested that REV may actually reduce the pool of susceptible cells for MDV replication, which would be compatible with the REV-associated atrophy of the lymphoid organs (Witter et al., 1981) . The lymphoid atrophy is strain specific and is caused by a combination of env and gag genes (Filardo et al., 1994) .",

In many instances, the actual molecular interactions between virus proteins and host cells are poorly identified. In order to use cytokines as adjuvants to improve vaccines as suggested by Asif et al. (2004) , future research needs to be focused on a better understanding of the interactions between viruses and cytokine regulation. Dohms and Metz (1991) indicated that the mechanisms of stress-induced immunosuppression were poorly understood especially in birds. The common pathway for stressors involves the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and results in the release of glucocorticoids, which are immunosuppressive for many species including chickens. Treatment of chickens with corticosterone or related glucocorticoids results in lymphopenia and atrophy of the lymphoid organs. Pruett (2001) suggested that the interactions between glucocorticoids and the immune system are more complex and, depending on the duration of the stress, can enhance or suppress or have no effect on immunological variables in mammalian species. Measuring several immunological parameters, E1-Lethey et al. (2003) compared the effects of treating chickens with corticosteroids with the effects of lack of foraging materials. Interestingly, antibody titres against SRBC and tetanus toxoid were decreased after both treatments, but antibodies to human serum albumin were not influenced by either treatment. In addition, CMI responses such as cutaneous response to PHA and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to mycobacterium antigen were decreased with both treatments. It is also noteworthy that the lack of foraging materials did not enhance plasma corticosterone levels significantly. In conclusion, stress may result in immunosuppression but the actual mechanisms remain elusive.",

At the time that cells become apoptotic VP3 forms discrete nuclear structures. The carboxy terminus is positively charged and, based on work with deletion mutants, it is suggested that the positive charge is important for the interaction with the nuclear DNA.

This observation has important consequences for genetic selection for MD resistance, because the resistant N2a line had a very strong proinflammatory response causing neurological disease with significantly higher levels of cytokine and NO production in the brain than in susceptible P2a chickens.

Removal of these cells restores the responsiveness of the T cells (e.g. Lee et al., 1978; Rup et al., 1979; Pertile et al., 1995) . Interestingly, this immunosuppression has been linked to NO production by macrophages. NO is a highly versatile molecule with immunosuppressive as well as anti-tumour, anti-bacterial, and antiviral activity. NO can influence gene expression probably through the NF~B pathway and, at high levels, can be part of proinflammatory pathology (reviewed by Bruckdorfer, 2005) .",

            "text": "As we have learnt more about the molecular interactions between viruses and their hosts, it has become apparent that most, if not all, viruses have to employ immunoevasion mechanisms to survive even the innate immune responses of the host. Those viruses with a persistent lifestyle also have to deploy a spectrum of subtle, refined mechanisms to survive in the face of potential acquired immune responses. The factors involved in immunoevasion were most easily identified in the large DNA viruses (poxviruses and herpesviruses). With the exception of the molluscipoxviruses, which have no direct relatives in birds but which have some similarities with the avian poxviruses, poxviruses cause acute infections and so their immunoevasion mechanisms only need to counter (or are only capable of countering) the innate immune responses, and possibly delay the acquired responses. The herpesviruses are able to become latent, a state that requires the expression of very few genes. They do, however, appear to be able to prevent the induction of acquired responses, even though the immune system is regularly open to stimulation by episodic, localized reactivation of latent virus. The recognition that large complicated viruses needed to evolve specific mechanisms to counter innate immune responses arguably drove the suspicion that the smaller, \"simple\" viruses (often with an RNA genome) must have evolved equivalent mechanisms to survive the same pressures. There are now several examples, particularly in the paramyxoviruses, of small accessory proteins of RNA viruses, or of multifaceted proteins, playing a role in immunoevasion, particularly in suppressing the type-I IFN pathway. The relative dearth of reagents available for many aspects of avian biology means that detailed study of the mode of action of many of the immunoevasion mechanisms of avian viruses remains woefully behind that of mammalian viruses. Indeed many of the mechanisms remain presumptive, but the situation should improve with the recent derivation of the draft chicken genome sequence. Recognition of the importance of avian viruses as emerging zoonotic agents, for instance West Nile virus and H5N1 avian influenza virus (AIV), is also likely to drive much more work in this area. We will consider immunoevasion mechanisms, both known and postulated, of avian herpesviruses, poxviruses, orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and reoviruses, as well as reviewing prospects for future work on avian adenoviruses and coronaviruses, orthomyxoviruses, and paramyxoviruses.",

Morimura et al. (1997) showed that MDV infection downregulates transcription of CD8. Hunt et al. (2001) reported that MHC class I expression was downregulated in two cell lines, MDVinfected OU2 cells and in MDV-transformed MSB-1 cells treated with 5-bromo-2'deoxyuridine, most likely through a block in the transport of the MHC molecules to the cell surface. Morgan et al. (2001a) , using microarray analysis, found that MDV upregulated MHC class I, but this is likely to be IFN driven. A mechanism that may favour survival of MDV in its latent state is promotion of the survival of MDV-transformed tumour cells. Whether this is achieved directly by enhanced expression of chicken CD30, previously identified as the AV37 antigen (Burgess et al., 2004) , or by the downregulation of CD28 seen in cells over-expressing CD30 (Burgess and Davison, 2002) is not clear, nor is the actual viral mechanism of achieving these perturbations in cell surface marker expression.",

The most interesting immunomodulator found in MDV is the IL-8 mimic (vIL-8), identified initially by its sequence homology with host IL-8. More informatively referred by its synonym, eotaxin, IL-8 is a chemokine capable of attracting eosinophils. Deletion of vIL-8 (Cortes and Cardona, 2004; Cui et al., 2005) or exon 1 of vIL-8 (Jarosinski and Schat, 2007) from the RB-1B strain of MDV resulted in a lower frequency of birds with tumours and smaller, less invasive tumours. This suggests that vIL-8 affects virus replication rather than tumorigenesis. The possibility of immunomodulatory functions for vIL-8 cannot be eliminated but the discovery that it can also be expressed as a fusion protein with the MDV oncoprotein Meq presents the likelihood of a more complicated situation (Anobile et al., 2006) .",

This was in contrast to the mammalian poxviruses, which encode: dsRNA binding proteins (e.g. E3 of vaccinia virus); mimics of eIF2% the substrate for activated dsRNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR (e.g. vaccinia virus K3) and secreted, soluble binding proteins for IFN-I and IFN-~.

The study concluded that there was considerable heterogeneity within and between virus populations in their ability to induce and resist avian IFN I. The heterogeneity was ascribed to the presence in the population of subpopulations that had packaged multiple genome segments. It was presumed that those particles which had packaged multiple segments encoding IFN resistance protein(s) displayed higher resistance, although this characteristic was not necessarily inherited. Such heterogeneity illustrates one of the potential complications of using live-recombinant influenza viruses to dissect out the role of particular molecular determinants of IFN resistance.",

            "text": "Resistance of influenza virus (influenza A virus unless otherwise specified) to IFN was initially believed to be primarily due to activation of a cellular inhibitor, p58(IPK), of PKR (Lee et al., 1990) . The mechanism of activation is still not known. Another mode of action involved the ubiquitin-like host protein, ISG15, which is one of the most predominant proteins induced by type I IFN (Bazzigher et al., 1992) . Influenza B virus induces ISG15 strongly but a specific region of the influenza B virus NS1 protein (NSIB), which includes part of its effector domain, blocks the ability of ISG15 to become covalently linked to its target proteins by inhibiting its UBEIL-mediated activation. The influenza A virus NS1 protein does not bind ISG15, but inhibits its synthesis (Yuan and Krug, 2001) . Subsequently, however, NS1 was shown to play a major role in resistance to IFN. Specifically, NS1 mutants were able to replicate only in IFN-defective cell lines (Garcia-Sastre et al., 1998) . NS1, normally 230 amino acids long in influenza A virus, is encoded by virus RNA segment 8. The amino terminus (73 residues) of NS1, which dimerizes (Wang and Krug, 1996) , is capable of binding dsRNA (Hatada and Fukuda, 1992) , albeit at relatively low affinity (Yuan and Krug, 2001) , thereby preventing activation of the dsRNAdependent protein kinase, PKR (Lu et al., 1995) . NS1 also binds polyadenylated RNA, inhibiting nuclear export of mRNAs (Qiu and Krug, 1994) , and a stem bulge in U6 snRNA, inhibiting pre-mRNA splicing in vitro and in vivo (Qiu et al., 1995) . Both of these activities can downregulate expression of cellular genes. It can also prevent IFN production both by binding to IRF-3, blocking its kinase-mediated activation (Talon et al., 2000) , and by blocking NF~B activation (Wang et al., 2000) . Although expression of NS1 alone was reported to induce apoptosis in MDCK and HeLa cells (Schultz-Cherry et al., 2001) , in the context of a viral infection of mammalian or avian cells, its IFN-regulatory activity makes it anti-apoptotic (Zhirnov et al., 2002) . NS1 selectively enhances translation of viral but not cellular mRNAs by binding eIF4GI, PABP1, and the 5' UTRs of vmRNAs (Aragon et al., 2000; Burgui et al., 2003) . It is interesting that the region of NS1 (aa 81-131) binding eIF4GI spans the location of the known virulence mutation (aa 92) and that the region of PABP1 to which NS1 binds is not conserved evolutionarily. The C terminus, or effector domain, downregulates formation and export of cellular mRNAs, by binding to the 30kDa subunit of CPSF and to PABII (Nemeroff et al., 1998; Krug, 1999, 2000) . The dsRNA-binding activity of NS1 can be abrogated by mutating 2 basic residues (R38 and K41 to A). In MDCK cells, virus thus mutated (Donelan et al., 2003) failed to inhibit IFN-~3 and replicated to lower titres. On passage, a better replicating virus emerged with an $42G mutation that did not improve dsRNA binding, but which had intermediate virulence in mice.",

These proteins are expressed following RNA editing of the mRNA that encodes P protein. Due to the lack of reagents for the avian IFN I system, this work has barely extended to avian paramyxoviruses. The likely role of the NDV V protein has, however, been demonstrated using genetically modified viruses (Park et al., 2003a) . Thus mutant viruses, defective for V protein expression (V-NDV), replicate poorly in embryonated eggs and chicken embryo fibroblasts. This defect can be complemented by transfection of a plasmid expressing cDNA encoding the V protein into V-NDV-infected cells (Park et al., 2003b) or by insertion of the influenza virus NS1 gene into the V-NDV. The NS1 gene allows the modified NDV to replicate better in human cells than does the parental NDV, suggesting the NDV V protein is more effective in modulating the chicken IFN system than the mammalian IFN system (unlike influenza NS1 which modulates both systems effectively). These differences are likely to be important for the host range specificities of the two viruses. IFN-sensitive NDV can also be rescued by transfection of a plasmid expressing cDNA encoding NDV V protein (Park et al., 2003b) . Although all examined V proteins of mammalian paramyxoviruses appear to be involved in modulating the mammalian IFN response, the actual detailed mechanism by which they do so varies from virus to virus. Elucidation of the mode of action of the NDV V protein will, therefore, require the availability of a full panoply of reagents specific for the avian IFN I system.",

Although the positive-strand RNA viruses, and even poxviruses, generate some dsRNA during their replication and transcription, the dsRNA viruses must be able to prevent recognition of their dsRNA genome by the cell. This is probably largely achieved by ensuring that the genome is never exposed outside of the capsid within the cytoplasm. However, the avian reoviruses, in common with mammalian reoviruses, appear to encode a dsRNA-binding protein aA that can mask dsRNA from cellular dsRNA binding proteins such as the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR.

This interest has so far had little impact on the study of avian viruses because of the lack of essential reagents. The recent derivation of the draft chicken genome sequence has opened up easier access to such reagents and it is likely that the coming years will see a rapid increase in the number of studies, and hence our knowledge of the intricacies of avian virus-host systems. Recent developments allowing manipulation of the large and complicated genome of IBV (Casais et al., 2001) , a coronavirus like the SARS virus, may also help identify additional viral immunomodulators, and hopefully elucidate their mode of action (Casais et al., 2005; Hodgson et al., 2006) . Such technology has been available for some time for avian adenoviruses but the divergence between mammalian and avian adenoviruses has made it difficult to predict candidate immunomodulators. Hopefully reannotation of the genome, which identified three putative surface glycoproteins with immunoglobulin-like folds, will be useful for further analysis (Washietl and Eisenhaber, 2003) . That this type of study is likely to elucidate new paradigms, which may even be relevant beyond the avian host, is illustrated by the relative dearth in avian herpesviruses and poxviruses of obvious immunomodulators of the type observed in their mammalian cousins. The emergence of West Nile virus and of H5N1 AIV as threats to wild birds, farmed poultry, mammalian livestock and companion animals and to humans, may lead to provision of resources needed to understand the complexity of the interactions of these and other viruses with their avian hosts. Hopefully as a consequence, we will be better equipped to control and treat, or possibly even eradicate, such viruses.",
