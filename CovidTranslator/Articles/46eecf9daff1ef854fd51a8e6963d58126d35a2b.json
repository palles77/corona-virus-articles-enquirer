Virus-specific CD8 \u03e9 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that recognize infected cells and contribute to viral clearance and tissue injury during HCV infection could be involved in the induction of AIH. To explore whether the antiviral cellular immunity may turn against self-antigens, we characterized the primary CTL response against an HLA-A * 0201-restricted HCV-derived epitope, i.e., HCV core 178-187, which shows sequence homology with human CYP2A6 and CYP2A7 8-17. To determine the relevance of these homologies for the pathogenesis of HCV-associated AIH, we used synthetic peptides to induce primary CTL responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy blood donors and patients with chronic HCV infection. We found that the naive CTL repertoire of both groups contains cross-reactive CTLs inducible by the HCV peptide recognizing both CYP2A6 and CYP2A7 peptides as well as endogenously processed CYP2A6 protein. Importantly, we failed to induce CTLs with the CYPderived peptides that showed a lower capacity to form stable complexes with the HLA-A2 molecule. These findings demonstrate the potential of HCV to induce autoreactive CD8 \u03e9 CTLs by molecular mimicry, possibly contributing to virus-associated autoimmunity.",

            "text": "A utoimmune hepatitis (AIH) 1 is a chronic liver disease of unknown etiology characterized by a persistent inflammatory reaction in the liver. The hallmarks of AIH are high titers of serum autoantibodies against different autoantigens and the presence of a hepatic, predominantly mononuclear cell infiltrate associated with liver cell damage. Several reports have shown the presence of autoreactive T cells in AIH patients. CD4 \u03e9 or CD8 \u03e9 liver-infiltrating T cells proliferate in response to autologous hepatocytes and some of them express high cytolytic activity (1) . Peripheral T cell clones from AIH patients also proliferate in response to liver-specific lipoprotein and the asialoglycoprotein receptor (2) . Type 2 AIH is defined by the presence of type I antiliver kidney microsome antibodies (LKM-1) recognizing cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 (3). In the liver and blood of patients with AIH type 2, CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 autoreactive T cells recognizing CYP2D6 have been detected, indicating a role of T cells in the pathogenesis of this disease (4, 5) . AIH type 2 appears to be epidemiologically linked to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Some patients with AIH type 2 have been shown to be positive for anti-HCV antibodies (6) and also for HCV RNA (7) , suggesting that HCV may cause a secondary autoimmune response. MHC class I-restricted CD8 \u03e9 CTLs are a major defense mechanism in viral infections. It has been suggested that the CTL response may This work was presented in part at the 5th International Meeting on Hepatitis C Virus and Related Viruses in Venice, Italy, June 25-28, 1998. contribute to viral clearance as well as to liver cell injury during HCV infection and might therefore play a role in the induction of autoreactive antibodies and CD4 \u03e9 helper T cells. CTLs recognize endogenously processed antigenic peptides in combination with MHC class I molecules presented on the cell surface. Several HCV-derived immunogenic CTL epitopes have been described thus far (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . Amino acid sequence comparison of HLA-A2-restricted HCV-derived CTL epitopes revealed the presence of two human CYP sequences related to HCV core 178-187, i.e., (Table I) . Compared with the HCV core 178 epitope, they display an eight amino acid sequence identity, one conservative substitution at the NH 2 -terminal anchor position (Leu to Val), and one nonconservative substitution at position 6 (Ser to Val or Ser to Ala). Both CYP sequences still contain the HLA-A2 binding motif, because both Leu and Val can serve as anchor residues (14, 15) . Therefore, the HCV core 178 peptide is a candidate for molecular mimicry, that is, similarity of infectious agents with host antigens. Such similarity may lead to an inability of the host immune system to recognize the foreign antigen or it may lead to an autoreactive immune response at the level of antibodies or T cells (16) (17) (18) .",

To determine the effect of the different HLA-A2 binding properties on T cell activation and antigen recognition by CTLs, we first analyzed the naive CTL repertoire in healthy blood donors. PBMCs from 12 healthy HCV-seronegative, HLA-A2-positive blood donors were stimulated with synthetic HCV core 178-187, CYP2A6 8-17, or CYP2A7 8-17 peptide in four replica cultures. After 5 wk, the cultures were tested for CTL activity against target cells presenting each of the three peptides. Long-term stimulation with the HCV core 178 peptide induced HCV core 178-specific CTLs in nine HCV-seronegative blood donors (Table II) . In five individuals, the HCV core 178-specific CTLs not only recognized the inducing HCV peptide but also CYP2A6 and/or CYP2A7 self-peptides. A higher specific lysis of targets presenting CYP2A7 was observed in most cases. Two donors recognized all three peptides, three individuals recognized HCV core 178 and CYP2A7 8-17, four recognized HCV core 178 only, and three did not show a CTL response after stimulation with HCV core 178. Representative results of three donors are shown in Fig. 2 a. These results as well as data obtained from CTL lines derived from positive cultures (data not shown) indicate the presence of three phenotypes of HCV core 178-specific CTLs: CTLs recognizing HCV core 178 only, CTLs cross-reactive with HCV core 178 and CYP2A7, and CTLs specific for HCV core 178, CYP2A7, and CYP2A6. We did not find CTLs recognizing CYP2A6 without recognition of CYP2A7, nor cells recognizing one of the CYP peptides without recognition of HCV core 178. Importantly, no CTL response could be induced with the self-peptides CYP2A6 8-17 (Fig.  2 b) and CYP2A7 8-17 (Fig. 2 c) in any of the 12 donors tested. This fits with our observation of different MHC-peptide interactions, because peptide-induced MHC stability and immunogenicity of the peptide are strongly correlated (28) .",

The higher off-rate of the CYP peptides had no effect on CTL recognition when the peptide-pulsed target cells were further incubated without peptide for up to 24 h before exposure to CTLs (Fig. 3 B ).

These findings were unexpected but similar findings had been observed by al-Ramadi et al., demonstrating that the pattern of functional activities of variant peptides does not always correlate with MHC binding (31) . In fact, other mechanisms involved in the interaction between the CTL and the target cell may be important, such as the TCR affinity for the MHC-peptide-complex, and CD8 binding to MHC class I, as well as other costimulatory and cell adhesion molecules (32) . To assess the role of CD8 binding on CTL-target cell interaction, we used a panel of three different anti-CD8 antibodies and tested their effect on target cell lysis. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 3 C using the OKT8 antibody. Although recognition of HCV core 178 depends in part on CD8 availability, self-peptide recognition of CYP2A6 does not. Further studies will be required to define the mechanism responsible for the discrepancy observed between peptide-MHC binding and CTL-mediated cytotoxicity.",

This indicates different T cell activation properties of the selfepitopes compared with the HCV peptide as described for altered peptide ligands (APLs), which are analogues of immunogenic peptides with amino acid substitutions inducing different effects in CTLs. APLs can act as agonists leading to full activation of T cells, partial agonists inducing only a reduced T cell response, or even antagonists inhibiting a response against the unaltered immunogenic epitope (33, 34) . The molecular mechanisms of APL-induced partial T cell activation are still a matter of debate (35) . Complexes of the native ligand or APLs with MHC molecules binding to the TCR can induce different intracellular signals in T cells (36) (37) (38) , either by different oligomerization of necessary molecules (CD3, CD8, or other molecules), or by a failure of the APL to induce a required conformational change in the TCR. Other studies state that the level of T cell activation is dependent on the number of TCRs triggered in a process of serial engagement of many TCRs by a few peptide-MHC complexes, allowing a single CTL to generate different biological responses (39) . Although specific cytotoxicity is already detectable at very low peptide concentrations, IFN-\u2425 production and proliferation require higher concentrations corresponding to higher numbers of TCRs being triggered (40) . This is in accordance with the finding that the immunogenicity of antigenic peptides strongly correlates with the stability of MHC-peptide complexes formed (28) , indicating that a high number and a high stability of MHC-peptide complexes is essential to trigger a sufficient number of TCRs to fully activate naive T cells. Despite this, the final effect of affinity differences or kinetic changes on the multimolecular interactions during antigen recognition cannot be predicted, as there is no strict correlation between functional activity of the various peptides and their MHC binding efficiency and the affinity of the MHC-peptide complexes for the TCR (31) .",

On the other hand, the HCV core 178 peptide that forms stable MHC-peptide complexes is able to induce full activation including maturation of CTLs. In the activated cross-reactive CTLs, cytolytic functions can then be induced by the HCV peptide, and also by the CYPderived APLs, as cytotoxicity requires a lower threshold of activation than proliferation.

Moreover, the presence of autoreactive T cells in the blood and the liver of AIH type 2 patients has been demonstrated, indicating a role for both CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cells in the pathogenesis of this disease (4, 5) . Cross-reactive CTLs may contribute to liver cell damage by lysis of infected and uninfected hepatocytes during ongoing viral infection and by lysis of uninfected autoantigenexpressing hepatocytes after viral clearance. However, the presence of virus-inducible autoreactive CTLs alone is not sufficient to lead to typical AIH, as none of the tested HCV patients had markers for AIH (LKM-1 autoantibodies). Probably the presence of autoreactive CD8 \u03e9 as well as autoreactive CD4 \u03e9 helper T cells is required for the induction of AIH. LKM-1 antigen (CYP2D6)-specific CD4 \u03e9 T cells detected in AIH patients would be needed for the activation of B cells secreting the AIH marker LKM-1 autoantibodies. Furthermore, autoreactive CD4 \u03e9 T cells could maintain the autoreactive CD8 T cell response after viral clearance, comparable with chronic viral infections where CD4 \u03e9 T cells are essential for maintaining the CTL response (43) (44) (45) (46) .",

            "text": "In summary, several arguments underscore the biological relevance of our findings. First, the viral epitope as well as the self-epitopes are naturally processed and presented by human host cells. Second, the self-epitopes and the viral epitope are coexpressed and colocalize to the liver in natural HCV infection, and expression of CYP2A6 is even enhanced in HCVinfected livers (47) . Third, the absence of CYP-inducible CTLs in the peripheral blood suggests that central or peripheral tolerance mechanisms are operational, indicating that the self-epitopes are presented to T cells in vivo. Fourth, the data presented show a high level of cross-recognition of virally induced CTLs against the self-peptides, suggesting that they can mediate liver cell damage to uninfected cells. Fifth, another line of evidence links HCV infection to autoimmune hepatitis type 2 (6). This disease has been described to occur subsequent to HCV infection (42) and, interestingly, in association with HLA-A2 (48) . Typically, it is associated with the presence of autoantibodies directed against cytochrome P450 2D6 (3, 6), as well as autoreactive CYP2D6-specific T cells, suggesting the parallel occurrence of autoreactivity against cytochrome P450 at the level of B and T cells (4, 5) . It can be hypothesized that liver cell damage mediated by virus-specific CTLs leads to the release of intracellular proteins like CYP2D6, uptake of these autoantigens by professional APCs, and autoantibody formation in the presence of autoreactive CD4 \u03e9 T and B cells. After viral clearance, the autoimmune disease is upheld by ongoing hepatocyte lysis by cross-reactive, HCV-induced CTLs maintained by autoreactive helper T cells. The coincidence of HCV, autoreactive B cells, and autoreactive CD8 \u03e9 and CD4 \u03e9 T cells is thus required for the induction of HCV-associated AIH. This would explain the relatively low frequency of AIH among HCV patients despite the high number of individuals with cross-reactive CTLs.",
