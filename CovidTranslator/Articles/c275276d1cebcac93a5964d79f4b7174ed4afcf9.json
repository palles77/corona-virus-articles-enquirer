Positing that improved USPIO with a higher affinity for atherosclerotic plaques would yield better plaque images, we performed MRI and histologic studies to compare the uptake of dextran-and mannan-dextrancoated USPIO (D-USPIO and DM-USPIO, respectively) by the atherosclerotic walls of rabbits. We intravenously injected atherosclerotic rabbits with DM-USPIO (n = 5) or D-USPIO (n = 5). Two rabbits were the controls. The doses delivered were 0.08 (dose 1) (n = 1), 0.4 (dose 2) (n = 1), or 0.8 (dose 3) (n = 3) mmol iron/Kg. The dose 3 rabbits underwent in vivo contrastenhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) before and 5 days after USPIO administration. Afterwards, all animals were euthanized, the aortae were removed and subjected to in vitro MRI study. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the aortic wall in the same region of interest (ROI) was calculated in both in vivo and in vitro studies. Histological assessment through measurement of iron-positive regions in Prussian blue-stained specimens showed that iron-positive regions were significantly larger in rabbits injected with DM-rather than D-USPIO (P , 0.05) for all doses.",

            "text": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory response to vessel wall injury, leading potentially, to acute coronary syndrome and cerebral vascular disorders, induced by plaque rupture. The noninvasive imaging of atherosclerotic plaque progression and of therapeutic response is very important. In atherosclerosis, macrophage accumulation initiates lesion development and triggers clinical events by producing several molecules that promote inflammation, plaque disruption, and subsequent thrombus formation. [1] [2] [3] [4] However, conventional anatomic measurements of advanced lesions (eg, plaque size or luminal narrowing) do not necessarily correlate with macrophage content. It is desirable that imaging of macrophages permits the identification of highly activated plaques, to help in the prediction of acute thrombotic events, and to facilitate assessment of the therapeutic effects of antiatherosclerotic drugs, such as statins. In hyperlipidemic rabbits and humans, atherosclerotic plaques have been investigated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxides (USPIO): iron oxide nanoparticles stabilized with low-molecular-weight dextran, having a mean diameter of 30 nm. [5] [6] [7] [8] As these relatively small particles are not immediately recognized by the hepatic and splenic mononuclear phagocytic systems (MPS), 9, 10 the prolongation of their intravascular half-life permits their uptake, via macrophages, by the whole body, including the lymph nodes, lungs, and the walls of atherosclerotic vessels. [5] [6] [7] [8] 11, 12 With respect to the excretion pathway, USPIO particles are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and metabolized via the lysosomal pathway. 13 On internalization by macrophages, the dextran coating is progressively degraded; 89% is eliminated in urine, and the rest is excreted in feces. The iron contained in USPIO is incorporated into the body's iron store and used in hemoglobin manufacture. Like endogenous iron, it is eliminated very slowly, predominantly via the feces. 14 Based on USPIO-associated T2-and T2*shortening effects, atherosclerotic lesions with accumulated USPIO can be detected on MRI scans. Higher doses tended to be administered in earlier animal studies. We posited that improved USPIO with higher affinity for atherosclerotic plaques would make it possible to obtain better images of plaques at lower doses.",

Therefore, we focused on mannan-dextran-coated USPIO (DM-USPIO), prepared in-house by adding alkalitreated mannan to dextran-coated USPIO (D-USPIO). Our working hypothesis posited that the addition of mannan to D-USPIO would facilitate its uptake by macrophage-rich atherosclerotic plaques. Here, we performed MRI and histopathological studies to compare the uptake of DM-USPIO with that of D-USPIO in atherosclerotic plaques of rabbits.",

This leads to a susceptibility-induced signal reduction in the atherosclerotic vessel wall on T1-weighted 3D gradient echo (GRE) images. In the T1-weighted fast 3D GRE sequence, T1 shortening is a characteristic of lower USPIO concentration. This renders the signal bright, and produces a predominant T2/T2* shortening at higher concentrations, resulting in a completely dark signal. 33 Consequently, at the initial stage of USPIO administration, the signal of the aortic lumen is completely dark due to a high blood concentration of USPIO. According to Ruehm et al, 5 the uptake by the MPS of USPIO particles over a 4-to 5-day period creates an ideal situation for imaging the vascular wall. The iron concentration in inflammatory cells in plaques is sufficiently high for the production of dominant T2 and T2* effects, while its concentration in the blood pool is at levels at which T1 shortening effects predominate. In that study, iron particles were observed electron microscopically in actively phagocytosing cells, but not in inactive foam cells filled with fat vacuoles. These, and other observations, suggest that both D-and DM-USPIO are potential contrast agents for the diagnosis of atherosclerotic plaques -which exhibit high activity before the onset of luminal narrowing -and are potentially useful for the assessment of therapeutic effects of anti-atherosclerotic drugs, such as statins.",

            "text": "Macrophages and dendritic cells can be targeted by mannosylated nanoparticles because immune cells, including alveolar and peritoneal macrophages, monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and Kupffer cells, constitutively express high levels of the mannose receptor (MR). Hashida and colleagues took the lead in the development of mannosylated liposomes to target macrophages and dendritic cells for delivery (in animal models) of the anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone palmitate and the CpG DNA complex. 34, 35 The study showed that intratracheally administered mannosylated liposomes, with various ratios of mannosylated cholesterol derivatives, were preferentially taken up by alveolar macrophages. Inhibition studies showed that mediation occurred via mannose receptor endocytosis. Mannosylation significantly improved liposome internalization by macrophages. 36 Our histological analyses showed that the uptake of DM-was higher than that of D-USPIO in the atherosclerotic wall of rabbits, resulting in a greater reduction of signal from the aortic wall in MRI scans. As the amount of intracellular iron was higher in macrophage cells treated with DM-rather than D-USPIO, we posit that macrophages contained in atherosclerotic plaques are more sensitive to DM-than to D-USPIO, making it possible to acquire plaque images at lower doses of contrast agent. We also found that the distribution of DM-USPIO in the liver and lung tended to be higher than that of D-USPIO, suggesting that receptor-mediated endocytosis had a strong role in the internalization of DM-USPIO by macrophages. As mannose receptors are expressed in the liver and lung, [34] [35] [36] it is not surprising that the distribution of DM-USPIO was higher than that of D-USPIO in these organs. We cannot rule out the possibility that increased distribution in these organs results in a reduction in the amount of circulating USPIO particles, and a consequent reduction in their presence in the aortic wall. However, based on our current findings, we suggest that the affinity of DM-USPIO particles for the aortic wall affects their uptake positively, and that the effect of reduced circulation of DM-USPIO due to its distribution in the liver and lungs is not strong. This is because the circulation lifetime of USPIOs is sufficiently prolonged, in accordance with particle size. On the other hand, the amount of iron per unit weight was not different irrespective of the type of USPIO used. We attributed this to technical difficulties with our preliminary arrangements for making NMR measurements. For our NMR measurements, the uniformity of the samples was the most important issue because we used minute quantities of sample for measurement. Nevertheless, it was very difficult to obtain vessel homogenates because the vessels contained abundant fibers. Consequently, insufficient preparation of uniform homogenate samples may have impacted our NMR measurements and caused inconsistency between NMR measurements and other examinations, such as imaging and histological analysis.",

            "text": "Our study has some limitations. First, the number of rabbits was too small to confirm the reproducibility of the observed aortic wall changes, and assessment of inter-individual differences was not possible. Second, the USPIO doses we used were too high for clinical applications; additional studies are necessary to identify appropriate human dose levels. Also, the imaging sequence was not optimized. (The use of a more T2*-weighted GRE sequence with longer echo times may enhance the sensitivity for iron-induced susceptibility effects. With such a sequence, even smaller iron accumulations can be detected. This may facilitate a further reduction in the contrast dose). Third, after the injection of D-and DM-USPIO particles, the signal from the aortic wall was very low and not uniform among the sites examined. ROI placement affects the results of imaging analysis, and ROI analysis of the aortic wall is subject to greater dispersions. In efforts to avoid this potential bias, we used the average result from three different ROIs in our SNR measurements. Fourth, the imaging effects we observed may be specific for WHHL rabbits.",

The graph compares pre-and post-administration SNR measurements in the ROI in the aortic wall of WHHL rabbits subjected to in vivo MRI (n = 6), after injection with D-or DM-USPIO (n = 3, respectively). The SNR values were significantly lower on all post-contrast images.

Compared to the controls, the signal from the aortic wall decreased in rabbits injected with D-or DM-USPIO, in a dose-dependent manner. At dose 3, the SNR tended to be lower (*P , 0.1) in rabbits treated with DM-USPIO. The SNR value obtained from three ROIs on three different aortic images was significantly lower (**P , 0.05) in the rabbit treated with dose 2 DM-USPIO than in the rabbit treated with an equivalent dose of D-USPIO. There was no significant difference at dose 1 (P . 0.1).
