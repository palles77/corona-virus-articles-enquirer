The recombinant pirBoHp protein was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Western blot analysis showed that the purified recombinant pirBoHp protein could be recognized by an anti-His-tag monoclonal antibody. Further investigations indicated that a polyclonal antibody against the recombinant pirBoHp protein could recognize the a and b chains of native bovine haptoglobin in a pooled plasma sample from dairy cattle suffering from foot rot.",

The pirBoHp gene was successfully expressed in the E. coli cells, which strongly supports the necessity and feasibility of optimization of the above conditions at the nucleotide level. At present, many purification methods for recombinant proteins generated in prokaryotic expression systems have been reported and include affinity chromatography and ion exchange chromatography, as well as purification methods based on tag proteins, gel-cutting purification, and so on. (21) (22) (23) (24) Of these protein purification methods, gel-cutting purification is a simple, time-saving, and much less expensive approach to the preparation of high-purity recombinant proteins in vitro. In our study, the cutting-gel purified proteins were dialyzed using the D-Tube\u00d4 Dialyzer (EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) to remove the SDS. The purified pirBoHp recombinant protein showed good antigenicity via Western blot analysis and antibody preparation. These data suggested that the purification of the pirBoHp recombinant protein by the gel-cutting method followed by electroelution and dialysis are compatible with most downstream applications.",
