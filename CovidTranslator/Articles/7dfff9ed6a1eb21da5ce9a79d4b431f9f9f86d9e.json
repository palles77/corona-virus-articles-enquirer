On September 11, 2001 , the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon demonstrated the important role hospitals play in the frontline response to sudden, unexpected incidents. Saint Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan (New York) and Virginia Hospital Center-Arlington activated their emergency operations, becoming vital elements of the organized medical response (Jurkovich, 2003; Kirschenbaum, Keene, O'Neil, Westfal, & Astiz, 2005) . The subsequent anthrax attacks in 2002 demonstrated the need for hospital personnel to know how to safely respond to victims of bioterrorism while maintaining a secure environment for other patients and sta\u00a1. Likewise, the events following the 2005 Hurricanes Katrina and Rita exposed the necessity of a resilient hospital infrastructure with the sustainability to care for vulnerable populations days following a widespread community disaster.",

            "text": "Among the most vulnerable populations in the aftermath the 2005 hurricanes were pregnant women and newborns. The unexpected levee system failure in New Orleans following the passage of Hurricane Katrina required that mothers and newborns be sustained in deteriorating conditions without back-up power, limited food and water, and sometimes insecure settings (Giarratano, Orlando, & Savage, 2008) . Through the heroic e\u00a1orts of many, all mothers and newborns were eventually rescued and survived. Yet the evacuation process was riddled with complications and took more than 4 days to fully accomplish (Orlando, Bernard, & Mathews, 2008) . Meanwhile, the surge in mother/ newborn services in receiving hospitals, such as Woman's Hospital in Baton Rouge 70 miles northwest of New Orleans, was enormous as they received and stabilized more than 122 infants and high-risk obstetric patients (Spedale, 2006) . These events sparked renewed attention to disaster planning in mother/newborn hospital settings, motivating work that resulted in the 2007 National Working Group for Women and Infant's Needs in Emergencies in the United States (Women and Infants Service Package, 2007) and the State Emergency Planning and Preparedness Recommendations for Maternal and Child Populations in 2008 (Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs) that guide disaster management in acute care and community settings. In addition, a plethora of information on disaster planning from governmental agencies such as the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and varied health care organizations provides a foundation for developing guidelines aimed at The authors and planners for this activity report no conflict of interest or relevant financial relationships.

This was followed in 2006 with the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA). This act set up the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) as the lead agency for coordinating public health and medical emergencies and an assistant secretary for preparedness and response (ASPR) to oversee the Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP). The HPP funding is administrated through state health departments to promote community emergency preparedness where local hospitals partner with state and community agencies to strengthen local responses. Outcomes of the HPP include benchmark initiatives to improve responses such as the National Hospital Available Beds for Emergencies and Disasters (HAvBED) system which includes a bed-tracking system to better measure response capabilities (Cantrill et al., 2005; Sauer, McCarthy, Knebel, & Brewster, 2009 ).

An HVA is conducted to identify conditions caused by either physical, cultural, social, or economic factors that can increase the exposure of a community to hazards. An HVA involves examining and forecasting the probability and severity of harm, the impact on the facility and community, and the level of preparedness of the facility to manage the disaster (TJC, 2005) . A prioritization of the hazards identi\u00a2ed in the HVA assessment will enable the hospital to make decisions and develop speci\u00a2c goals and objectives that are in the best interest of the facility. An agency providing obstetrical services needs to have an estimate of the number of childbearing women in the community who may need services. Additionally, the agency should be aware of the social and economic issues that might a\u00a1ect the population and make them more vulnerable to health care complications after a disaster. The mitigation phase is a continual process, and an analysis of hazards should be conducted routinely.",

Planning remains the cornerstone for preparing health care responders and institutions to anticipate the needs of the community and plan actions to reduce the impact of disasters on the a\u00a1ected population. Lack of adequate preparedness can create an environment of disorganization and anarchy with the potential of increasing injuries and loss of life (WHO & ICN, 2009 ). For a hospital, an emergency operations plan that is straightforward, comprehensive, simple to implement, and developed in collaboration with government agencies, emergency responders, other health care professionals, and community representatives is an essential component of disaster preparedness (Counts & Prowant, 2001) . The emergency operations plan must address such issues as the chain of command; preparing and training hospital sta\u00a1; activities to reduce the hospital's vulnerability; securing adequate inventory of supplies and equipment; promoting community awareness through collaboration, coordination, and communication methods ; testing the plan by conducting drills and exercises, and evaluating drills and exercises to assess the hospital's preparedness capabilities; thereby identifying areas for improvement.

During this phase the urgent needs of survivors are met. Nurses must have the necessary knowledge and skills to competently assess, triage, and monitor survivors for physical and mental health issues, and provide appropriate care in an environment with limited resources (WHO & ICN, 2009 ). Evacuation of the hospital and relocation of patients, visitors, and sta\u00a1 usually occurs during the response phase of the disaster. Nurses should be trained on evacuation procedures such as developing a process for infallible identi\u00a2cation of infants, identifying evacuation sites for mothers and infants, identifying proper evacuation equipment (i.e., vests), and establishing back-up or alternate evacuation routes (Schultz, Pouletsos, & Combs, 2008) . At one hospital after Hurricane Katrina, well newborn babies and their mothers had to be evacuated by boats to access ambulances several miles away. Family members should be kept together whenever possible to provide support to each other. If it becomes necessary to separate mothers from sick babies or family, there should be a system in place to assist in reconnecting families as soon as possible.",

Situations resulting in scarce equipment and supplies, limited sta\u00a1 and support services (dietary, laundry, sterilization, pharmacy), and infrastructure losses (electricity, water, plumbing, sanitation) will change nursing care delivery. Priorities shift to providing only essential care. During the time of disaster, the expected goal of providing the best, complete nursing care based on the individualized needs of the patient may change to a utilitarian framework of care in which the objective is to provide the greatest good for the greatest number of individuals. When this shift is called for by an incident command structure in the institution, there needs to be guidance on what conditions of care will change. TJC requires that hospitals predetermine what routine activities would be delayed or omitted, such as vital signs, baths, extensive charting, and nonessential medications (TJC, 2006 ",

I N F O C U S CNE will receive care based on the likelihood of survival, commonly referred to as \u00a2eld triage. Triage is a skill that combines an assessment of the status and prognosis of the patient with knowledge of the medical resources available for treatment. Advanced practice nurses including nurse midwives, clinical nurse specialists, and nurse practitioners with expertise in advanced assessment of mothers and infants can \u00a2ll critical disaster response roles in triage, transfer, and discharge (Cole, 2005) . A shift to a utilitarian ethical framework necessitates that scarce resources be used to provide immediate care for those most likely to recover without extraordinary means. This also includes deciding which patients have priority for transfer from the disaster area to a full-care facility. These decisions are best made by a designated triage o\u2044cer or those trained to use established criteria or algorithms to categorize, score, or rank patients based on who will bene\u00a2t most from immediate emergency care (Qureshi & Veenema, 2007) . Table 2 lists an example of triage criteria commonly used in disaster situations. Patients are categorized based on type and severity of illness or injury, and assessment of airway, breathing, circulation, vital signs, level of consciousness, and by visual inspection. Although nurses working on hospital units may not be directly involved in the triage process, they care for patients based on triage decisions, providing speci\u00a2c interventions to support those who are likely to recover, and palliative care to those not expected to survive. Nurses need to understand the triage decisions made and be prepared to care for patients in this complex situation, using competencies that support worker and patient safety and the basics of airway, breathing, circulation, control of blood loss, and infection control (Gebbie, Peterson, Subbarao, & White, 2009) .",

However, full-term neonates may have life-threatening multisystem medical or surgical conditions that may not be treatable during a disaster with limited resources.

Hospitals that reopen postdisaster need to anticipate women and their newborn infants using medical emergency services for routine care due to disrupted clinics and pediatric services in the community. Mental health clinics may need to be expanded to address long-term stress in the community. Hospital-based social services will need referrals for women who lack housing, food and infant supplies, or are in need of day care services. The long-term goal of the recovery phase is to restore the a\u00a1ected area to its previous state as much as possible. This phase involves rebuilding, reemployment, and repairing the infrastructure. It is crucial that coordination and collaboration with the community occurs.
