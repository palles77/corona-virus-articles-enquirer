In this report, we describe the biochemical properties of a full-length recombinant SARS-CoV nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) capable of copying viral RNA templates. The purified SARS-CoV nsp12 showed both primerdependent and primer-independent RNA synthesis activities using homopolymeric RNA templates. The RdRp activity was strictly dependent on Mn 2? . The nsp12 preferentially copied homopolymeric pyrimidine RNA templates in the absence of an added oligonucleotide primer. It was also able to initiate de novo RNA synthesis from the 3'-ends of both the plus-and minus-strand genome of SARS-CoV, using the 3'-terminal 36-and 37-nt RNA, respectively. The in vitro RdRp assay system established with a full-length nsp12 will be useful for understanding the mechanisms of coronavirus replication and for the development of anti-SARS-CoV agents.",

The SARS-CoV genome has 14 open reading frames (ORFs) flanked by 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), which are essential cis-acting elements required for viral replication [29] . The 5' two-thirds of the viral genome contains two large ORFs, 1a and 1b, the latter of which is expressed by ribosomal frameshifting near the 3' end of ORF1a [1, 23] . The two large polyproteins, pp1a, encoded by ORF1a, and pp1ab encoded by ORF1a and ORF1b, are processed by two viral proteases to generate a total of 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), most of which likely serve as RNA replicase components [29, 35] . The nsp12, which is the first protein encoded by ORF1b, has common viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) motifs and is thus the catalytic core of the RNA replicase [39] .",

            "text": "RNA genome replication is a crucial step in SARS-CoV propagation and is mediated by the RNA replicase, which has been proposed to be comprised of viral nsps and host proteins. The SARS-CoV replicase complex transcribes the full-length plus-strand viral genome and its complementary minusstrand genomic RNA template. In addition, the replication complex transcribes a set of 3'-coterminal nested subgenomic mRNAs with a 5' leader sequence derived from the 5' end of the genome and the corresponding minus-strand subgenomic RNAs by discontinuous RNA transcription [26, 29] . During synthesis of the viral genome and its subgenomes, nsp12, alone or with the help of viral and/or cellular proteins, is thought to initiate RNA synthesis from the 3' ends of the viral genome and subgenomes in both the plus and minus senses [37] . Correct initiation of RNA synthesis is essential for maintenance of the integrity of viral genomes. RNA viruses use two principally different mechanisms by which RNA synthesis can be initiated: de novo initiation and primerdependent initiation [12] . During de novo initiation, the starting nucleotide provides the 3' hydroxyl group for the addition of the next nucleotide. In contrast, primer-dependent initiation requires the use of a separate oligonucleotide or protein primer to provide the hydroxyl nucleophile. The mechanisms of RNA synthesis initiation for SARS-CoV have not been well characterized. In particular, the details of subgenomic RNA synthesis remain unknown [19] .",

Further, it would be an important tool for determining the mode of RNA synthesis initiation to provide important mechanistic insight into the SARS-CoV replication cycle [19] . Previously, the RdRp activity of SARS-CoV nsp12 was demonstrated using nonviral RNA templates [4, 33] . An RdRp assay system using an enzymatically active nsp12 accepting exogenous viral genome-derived RNA templates would enable us to characterize RNA synthesis initiation mechanisms and to initiate exploration of the mechanisms involved in subgenomic RNA synthesis. However, previous studies did not investigate whether nsp12 uses the 3'-end RNA regions of the viral genome and its complementary minus-strand RNA template.",

T7 RNA polymerase was previously shown to have an RNAlabeling activity in vitro on some RNAs through intra-or intermolecular priming [3] . Thus, to avoid potential contamination of T7 RNA polymerase, the amplified gene was expressed using the E. coli expression vector pTrcHisB, in which gene expression is controlled by a trc chimeric promoter. As shown in Fig. 1A , the recombinant nsp12 expressed from the resulting vector is expected to have extra amino acids at the N-terminus, which are introduced during the cloning procedure.

The RdRp assay was performed with a poly(A) RNA template in the absence and presence of the primer oligo(U) 20 . As shown in Fig. 2A , nsp12 exhibited primer-dependent RdRp activity that was strictly dependent on Mn 2? for RNA synthesis. Mg 2? could not replace Mn 2?

Using the two viral-genome-derived RNA templates representing parts of the 3'-UTRs of the plus and minus strands of the viral genome, namely 3'-UTR339 ? 16A and c5'-UTR119 (see the schematic diagrams of these RNA templates shown in Fig. 4) , we consistently observed Mn 2? -dependent RdRp activity (Fig. 2C ). This Mn 2?dependent RdRp activity was also observed using a poly(C) template (Fig. 3B) . The optimal Mn 2? concentration for nsp12 activity was 2 mM (Fig. 2D) . The temperature and pH for optimal SARS-CoV nsp12 activity were determined to be 32\u00b0C and pH 7.5, respectively ( Fig. 2E and F).

            "text": "To investigate the template preference of the recombinant SARS-CoV nsp12, we performed RdRp assays with four different homopolymeric RNA templates in the absence or presence of 20-mer complementary ribonucleotide primers. Interestingly, we found that homopolymeric pyrimidine RNA templates [poly(C) and poly(U)] served as better templates than homopolymeric purine RNA templates [poly(A) and poly(G)] (Fig. 3A) . The polymerase activity was highest with the poly(C) template, and initiation of RNA synthesis occurred in the absence of a complementary (rG) 20 primer, although addition of the primer increased the levels of RNA products (compare lanes 3 and 4) . A similar increase in the amount of labeled RNA product was observed using a poly(U) template with an (rA) 20 primer (lanes 7 and 8) . In contrast, a low but detectable amount of RNA product was produced from the homopolymeric purine RNA templates only in the presence of complementary primers. Collectively, our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV nsp12 has both primer-dependent and primer-independent RNA synthesis activity, depending on the type of RNA template used. The catalytic domain of SARS-CoV nsp12 is composed of finger, palm, and thumb subdomains, with a conserved SDD motif located in the active site of the palm subdomain (Fig. 1A) [39] . To prove that the RdRp activity of nsp12 is due to its own enzymatic activity, we mutated the SDD 759-761 motif to SAA to inactivate the enzyme. As shown in Fig. 3C , while wild-type nsp12 had robust RdRp activity on a poly(C) template (lane 1), the SAA mutation completely abolished the polymerase activity (lane 2). SARS-CoV nsp12 has a unique domain encompassing the N-terminal 370 amino acids, which is not present in most other plus-strand RNA virus RdRps, and the functional importance of this domain has not been determined [29, 39] . We expressed and purified a recombinant form of the unique domain and determined whether it had RNA-labeling activity. Using the in vitro RdRp assay with a poly(C) template, we found that the unique domain did not have RNA polymerase activity (Fig. 3C, lane  3) . We also attempted to express the nsp12 catalytic domain (amino acids 371-932), but we could not get soluble recombinant proteins (data not shown). Lastly, the SARS-CoV RdRp activity was not significantly inhibited by either actinomycin D (20 lg/ml) or rifampicin (20 lg/ml) (Fig. 3D) , indicating that the RdRp activity of nsp12 was not attributable to contamination by bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerases.",

We sought to determine whether a poly(A) tail is required for in vitro minus-strand viral RNA synthesis. The 339-ntlong, full-length SARS-CoV 3'-UTR template lacking the poly(A) tail (Fig. 4A ) and the 3'-UTR templates possessing different lengths of a poly(A) tail (13-32 polyadenylates) were prepared by in vitro transcription and used as templates for RdRp reactions. The recombinant nsp12 was able to copy the 3'-UTR template lacking the poly(A) tail in the absence of a primer (Fig. 4B, lane 1) . Furthermore, the 3'-UTR RNA templates with 13-16 adenylates were used as efficiently as the 3'-UTR lacking the poly(A) tail (compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3) . However, there was an incremental decrease in the amounts of RNA product when a poly(A) tail longer than 16 nt was added to the template (lanes 4 and 5). Having found that the 3'-UTR upstream of the poly(A) tail is critical for viral minus-strand RNA synthesis, we mapped the minimal cis-acting RNA element within the 3'-UTR by RdRp assays with serial deletion derivatives of the 3'-UTR template lacking the poly(A) tail. As shown in Fig. 4C , nsp12 was able to synthesize templatesize labeled RNA products in a primer-independent manner, suggesting that a 36-nt sequence and/or a secondary structure in the 3'-UTR is a minimal RNA region recognized by nsp12 for de novo RNA synthesis initiation in vitro.",

To map the minimal region recognized by SARS-CoV RdRp, various RNA templates (Fig. 4D) representing the complementary sequences of the 5'-UTR of the SARS-CoV genome (c5'-UTR) were tested for their template activities in the in vitro RdRp assay. The nsp12 was able to initiate RNA synthesis with as little as 37 nt of RNA from the 3' end of the c5'-UTR (Fig. 4E, lane 5) . Thus, a 36-nt sequence from the 3'-UTR and a 37-nt sequence from the c5'-UTR, which were predicted to form stable stem-loop structures ( Fig. 4A and D) , seem to be the minimal cis-acting RNA elements required for nsp12 to initiate RNA synthesis. Together, the data suggested that nsp12 might be able to initiate RNA synthesis from either a double-stranded stem region (Fig. 4A) or a single-stranded region (Fig. 4D) .

The RTC, which was isolated from double-membrane vesicles formed in SARS-CoV-infected cells, displayed an RdRp activity using endogenous RTC-associated viral RNA templates. However, it was not determined whether or not the SARS-CoV RTC could utilize exogenous RNA templates. Furthermore, the RdRp activity was dependent on an as-yet-unidentified host factor(s) present in the cytoplasmic soluble fraction. In contrast to the results observed with the RTC, a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused SARS-CoV RdRp showed primer-dependent RdRp activity on a poly(A) RNA template [4] , which is consistent with our results. Another study also showed that the SARS-CoV nsp12 has primer-dependent RdRp activity on a synthetic RNA template consisting of a 20-nt duplex and a 5' overhang of 10 uridylates, which could serve as a template during extension of the 20-nt primer [34] . However, none of the prior studies demonstrated bona fide RdRp activity of nsp12, i.e., RNA synthesis initiated de novo from exogenous RNA templates and from the 3' ends of viral genomic RNA and its complementary strand. We demonstrated for the first time that the recombinant nsp12 has RNA polymerase activity capable of initiating RNA synthesis de novo from the 3' ends of both plus and minus strands of the SARS-CoV genome. This nsp12 could also copy homopolymeric RNA templates in either a primerindependent manner with poly(C) and poly(U) templates or in a primer-dependent manner with poly(A) and poly(G) templates. Our results also suggested that purine nucleotides are preferentially used by nsp12 for de novo initiation of RNA synthesis. In contrast, te Velthuis et al. [34] found that the use of poly(U) or poly(C) template did not lead to significant incorporation of nucleotides in RdRp assays with nsp12 with a natural N-terminus and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. This dramatically different property of nsp12 might be in part attributed to the C-terminal hexahistidine tag.",

            "text": "In contrast to previous data obtained by using recombinant SARS-CoV RdRps [4, 34] , our results also show that nsp12 strictly requires Mn 2? ions as a cofactor. Previously, the N-terminal GST-fused SARS-CoV nsp12 showed a primer-dependent RNA polymerase activity in the presence of Mg 2? using a poly(A)/oligoU 16 template [4] . However, the full-length nsp12 with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag displayed a primer-dependent RNA polymerase activity using a short primed poly(U) template in the presence of either Mg 2? or Mn 2? [33] . The authors demonstrated that Mn 2? promoted misincorporation of ribonucleotides. The SARS-CoV RTC complex isolated from virus-infected cells displayed RdRp activities in vitro only in the presence of Mg 2? ions [14] . The reason for the requirement of different metal ions by the RTC and recombinant nsp12 proteins is not clear. It is possible that the hexahistidine tag or fused proteins at the N-or C-terminus of nsp12 might affect the enzymatic properties of the recombinant nsp12 proteins. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that SARS-CoV nsp8, a second non-canonical RdRp, also requires Mn 2? as a cofactor [10] . Since nsp8 interacts directly with nsp12, as demonstrated by GST pull-down experiments [10] , these two proteins may form a replicase complex showing Mn 2? ion dependence for RNA synthesis. It has been argued that Mn 2? is unlikely to act as a cofactor of cellular and viral enzymes because Mn 2? is known to be present at less than 1 % of the abundance of Mg 2? [24] . However, various enzymes, including viral RdRps, have shown a strict Mn 2? -dependence [24] . Mn 2?dependent RdRps might overcome the limited availability of Mn 2? by their high affinity for Mn 2? . It is equally plausible to speculate that SARS-CoV nsp12, like other viral RNA polymerases [9, 24, 33] , becomes more errorprone with Mn 2? . The dependence on Mn 2? ions for RdRp activity was also observed for other viral RdRps, including Japanese encephalitis virus NS5 RdRp [13] , equine arteritis virus nsp9 RdRp [2] , RdRps of dengue virus and West Nile virus [27] , and hepatitis C virus NS5B RdRp [5, 17, 24] . Recent studies showed that HCV NS5B displays different modes of RNA synthesis initiation depending on the types of catalytic metal ions, Mg 2? or Mn 2? ; Mn 2? appears to stimulate de novo RNA synthesis on certain RNA templates [24] .",

In addition, the poly(A) tail has been proposed as a potential cis-acting element for genome replication and transcription in several viruses [15, 31, 32, 36] . However, it still remains to be elucidated whether an increase of viral genome abundance after the addition of a poly(A) tail to the 3'-end of viral genomes or defective interfering RNAs was due to the direct effect on viral RNA synthesis rather than to the enhancement of viral gene expression or RNA genome stabilization. Our results demonstrated that the poly(A) tail of the SARS-CoV genome is dispensable for the initiation of minus-strand viral RNA synthesis. Although the SARS-CoV nsp12 required a primer to direct RNA synthesis using a homopolymeric poly(A) template, the tailless 3'-UTR terminal 36-nt served as a template for the de novo initiation of RNA synthesis. Thus, the 3'-end RNA structure and/or sequence upstream of the poly(A) tail appears to be the major cis-acting element required for initiation of minus-strand RNA synthesis and possibly for discrimination between cellular mRNAs and the viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs. Our data also showed that minus-strand RNA synthesis is inhibited by a poly(A) tail longer than 16 nt, suggesting a regulatory role of the poly(A) in RNA synthesis. Thus, it will be of interest to test whether SARS-CoV genomic and subgenomic RNAs carrying poly(A) tail of different lengths can be differentially utilized by the viral RNA replicase and translational machinery.",

            "text": "Even though the terminal 36-nt of the 3'-UTR allowed nsp12 to carry out de novo initiation of RNA synthesis in vitro, it remains to be determined whether other viral or cellular proteins are required in vivo for the SARS-CoV replicase to recognize specific promoter sequences on the SARS-CoV 3'-UTR. For instance, as proposed recently by Zust et al. [41] for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) minusstrand RNA synthesis, nsp8 primase of SARS-CoV might bind to a 3'-UTR stem-loop structure and initiate minusstrand RNA synthesis by production of a tract of oligo(U) using the 3'-end poly(A) tail of the viral genome as a template. The authors proposed that the synthesis of a short primer representing the 5' end of minus-strand RNA leads to separation of the 3' end of the genome from pseudoknot loop 1, allowing the formation of a completely folded pseudoknot. That structure, together with nsp8 and other viral nonstructural proteins, then recruits nsp12 to resume elongation of minus-strand RNA synthesis by primer-extension. This notion is in part supported by the fact that the SARS-CoV nsp8 displays an RdRp activity synthesizing a short oligonucleotide [10] . Thus, nsp8 of SARS-CoV may be required to form a pre-initiation RNA replicase complex through interaction with nsp12 [10] . Direct binding of an nsp8/nsp12 complex or sequential binding of nsp8 and nsp12 to the 3'-UTR may cooperatively carry out minus-strand RNA synthesis. It would be of interest to investigate whether a short primer generated by the primase activity of nsp8 can be in turn extended by the primer-dependent RNA polymerase activity of nsp12. Furthermore, it should be also noted that coronaviruses, including MHV, bovine coronavirus, and SARS-CoV, have two structurally conserved RNA structures, a bulged stemloop and an adjacent pseudoknot, upstream of the 3'-UTR [7] . Genetic studies using a full-length MHV-A59 cDNA cloned into vaccinia virus showed a genetic interaction of the loop 1 of the pseudoknot with the nsp8 and nsp4, which are the components of the RNA replicase [41] . Since the SARS-CoV 3'-UTR was able to functionally replace its counterpart in the MHV genome, the pseudoknot region might be a critical cis-acting element for viral genome replication in vivo. Further analysis of the roles of the 3'-UTR and viral or cellular proteins interacting with this cisacting RNA in RNA synthesis initiation is warranted using the in vitro RdRp assay system we have established in the present study.",

The unique domain, the catalytic domain, and the conserved RdRp active-site residues of the nsp12 are indicated. The deduced N-terminal sequences of the indicated nsp12 protein are shown. (B-D) The nsp12 protein was expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography using an Ni-NTA agarose column (B), anionexchange chromatography using a Q-Sepharose column (C), and GFC using a Superdex 200 column (D). SARS-CoV nsp12 bound to an Ni-NTA agarose and a Q-Sepharose column were eluted by increasing concentrations of imidazole and NaCl, respectively. Eluted proteins and fractions collected from the Superdex 200 column were separated by 10 % SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue. Arrowheads indicate the position of SARS-CoV nsp12. In panel (D), proteins identified by MS/MS analysis are shown. (E) The final purified recombinant nsp12 (2 lg) was resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie blue staining",
