The disease is believed to result from an aberrant inflammatory response to an infectious trigger in a genetically predisposed individual. KD is associated with an endothelial cell injury as a consequence of T cell activation and cytotoxic effects of various proinflammatory cytokines. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion and aspirin are the standard treatment of acute KD. However, 10-20% of patients show resistance to IVIG therapy and present higher risk of coronary vasculitis. The relative roles of second IVIG infusion, corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, interleukin-1 antagonists and anti-tumor necrosis factor agents remain uncertain. In this review, we highlight the predisposing factors, pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention of KD, particularly new therapeutics for IVIG-resistant patients.",

KD predominantly affects young children aged between 6 months and 4 years, and is the leading cause of acquired heart disease among children in Japan, European countries and the USA. However, KD is also reported in adults [2] . KD involves predominantly small and medium-sized arteries. Patients with complete KD usually have fever of at least 5 days duration and presence of four principal features: changes in peripheral extremities, polymorphous exanthema, bilateral non-exudative conjunctival injection, and changes in the oral cavity and cervical lymphadenopathy (1.5 cm diameter). KD is believed to be secondary to an aberrant inflammatory response to an infectious trigger in a genetically predisposed individual. The three distinct diagnostic vasculopathic processes observed in severely affected KD patients are necrotizing arteritis, subacute/chronic vasculitis and luminal myofibroblastic proliferation; and have the potential to cause life-long cardiovascular sequelae or death [3] . In this review, we focus on the predisposing factors, pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention of KD.",

First, the clinical picture of KD overlaps with infectious diseases, such as adenovirus and scarlet fever. Second, seasonal clustering of KD during winter and spring is similar to other viral diseases like influenza viruses and enteroviruses [8] . In fact, temporal clusters of epidemics have been reported in Japan, the USA, Canada and Finland [9] . Presence of IgA plasma cells in the trachea of patients who died of acute KD suggests entry of the KD etiologic agent through the upper respiratory tract, resulting in an IgA immune response with systemic spread to vascular tissue [10] . Light and electron microscopy studies have demonstrated the presence of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in the inflamed tissues of acute KD [11] . These inclusion bodies are suggestive of an infectious etiology of KD as a result of intracellular pathogens, particularly viruses.",

Superantigens such as staphylococcal enterotoxins and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins do not need classical antigen processing and presentation by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Superantigens cause extensive T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion following direct binding to major histocompatibility complex class II proteins on the surface of APCs. However, no specific bacteria or superantigens were identified in the KD scenario, but the clinical features of KD are similar to those seen in patients with staphylococcal and streptococcal toxin-mediated disease. The release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a is directly related to the clinical picture of fever, mucosal involvement and desquamation in toxic shock syndrome and KD [12] . The infrequent occurrence of KD among young infants might be caused by passively acquired maternal antibodies to toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST)-1 superantigen [13] . As compared to a control group, patients with KD are more likely to have positive rates of viral PCR for different viruses including enterovirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus (50.4% vs 16.4%, P < 0.001) [14] .",

Also, KD patients in Asian countries and Hawaii may have more probabilities of exposure and colonization of KD agents, and the distribution of some normal flora in parents or guardians of young children in these regions can differ to Western countries, including France, and developing countries.

The number of patients and the incidence rate of KD in Japan are continuing to increase [18] . Further, the genetic basis of susceptibility to KD is complex, and no single HLA class II haplotype is common to most patients. Also, genetic factors might not be associated with racial difference of KD incidence. Table 1 shows candidate KD susceptibility genes that have recently gained interest [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] and genetic study of adaptive immune cell compartments could further help to detect severely affected KD patients.

Therefore, Ca 2+ mobilization plays a major part in the immunopathogenesis of KD. The polymorphism in ITPKC might result in increased IL-1b via activation of NLRP3. Data from several studies show that a SNP within the ITPKC gene confers susceptibility to KD as well as an increased risk of coronary artery aneurysms in Japanese, Taiwanese and American populations [20, 24] . ITPKC also acts as a negative regulator of T cell activation through the Ca 2+ /NFAT signaling pathway. The ITPKC polymorphism might result in increased activation of T cells with an increased expression of IL-2. A SNP within the CASP3 gene has also been associated with susceptibility to KD in cohort studies of Asian and American patients [21, 25] . It was found that G to A substitution in one commonly associated SNP located in the 5 0 untranslated region of CASP3 abolished binding of NFAT to the DNA sequence surrounding the SNP [21] .",

It was also suggested that severely affected KD patients with giant aneurysms have improper immune and repair systems against KD agents or injured coronary artery cells [30] . As mentioned earlier, oligoclonal IgA plasma-cell infiltration has been demonstrated in the arterial wall, the upper respiratory tract and the pancreas of patients with acute KD. This suggests an antigen-driven immune response to an etiologic agent with a respiratory portal of entry [10] . The influx of neutrophils characterizes the early stage of KD. The resultant reactive oxygen species and other inflammatory mediators contribute to endothelial inflammation [31] . Infiltrating macrophages, T lymphocytes and cellular components of the arterial wall such as myofibroblasts are also important in the disease pathogenesis. They secrete a number of inflammatory mediators, enzymes and other molecules such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which contribute to vascular leakage and edema.",

Therefore stimulation of FcgRIIA results in the activation of these immune cells leading to expression of activation-associated surface molecules, co-stimulatory molecules and secretion of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Of note, a functional polymorphism in FCGR2A encoding an H131R substitution has been identified as a susceptibility locus for KD [26] .

Initially used for the replacement therapy of primary and secondary immunodeficient patients, high-dose IVIG has been subsequently used to treat a large number of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. The American Heart Association recommends a single administration of 2 g/kg of IVIG for KD patients within 5-10 days after onset of fever [39] . IVIG treatment not only reduces inflammation (fever, clinical signs, acute phase reactant levels) but also, and more importantly, prevents the development of coronary artery abnormalities [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] . It reduces the risk of coronary artery lesions from 20-25% to 2-4%. Because coronary artery lesions begin to occur before the peak of inflammation, it is important to initiate IVIG therapy within a week of fever onset.",

Although all these mechanisms might not be applicable to KD, several of them have been demonstrated in KD patients following IVIG therapy ( Table 2) . Several studies have shown that IVIG suppresses innate inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-6 [37, [59] [60] [61] . IVIG also reduces nitric oxide production by neutrophils in KD patients [31] . Analysis of serum Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokine levels revealed that INF-g, IL-10 and IL-17A decreased rapidly following IVIG treatment [37, 62] . By contrast, IVIG reciprocally enhanced the expression of Treg transcription factor FoxP3 [63] .",

ITPKC controls Ca 2+ homeostasis by phosphorylating IP3 and genome-wide association studies have reported that polymorphisms within the ITPKC gene were associated with susceptibility and severity of Kawasaki disease. IP3 binds to its receptor IP3R expressed on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and causes the release of Ca 2+ into the cytoplasm. Ca 2+ mobilization mediates NLRP3 activation. Certain PAMPS are also capable of directly activating the NLRP3 inflammasome. Activation of the inflammasome results in the cleavage of pro-IL-1b into its biologically active form IL-1b, which shapes adaptive immune responses. IL-1b can enhance naive T cell survival and proliferation, via upregulation of the IL-2 receptor. Additionally, a role for IL-1R signaling in Th17 cell differentiation and homeostasis has been reported.

Even the safety of this treatment used at anti-inflammatory doses has been debated. A Cochrane review in 2006 concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support aspirin use for KD [68] . Meta-analysis comparing moderate-dose aspirin (30-50 mg/ kg per day) with high-dose aspirin (80-120 mg/kg per day) combined with IVIG found no significant difference in the incidence of coronary abnormalities between the groups [69] . Moderate doses of aspirin are used in the acute phase. A low antiplatelet dose (3-5 mg/kg/day) is used following defervescence. Low-dose aspirin is continued for at least the first 8 weeks of illness, during which time the risk of coronary artery damage is greatest.",
