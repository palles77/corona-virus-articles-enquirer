Therefore, a rapid detection assay is imperative for BEFV diagnosis. In this study, we described the development of lateral-flow dipstick isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (LFD-RPA) assays for detection of BEFV. RPA primers and LF probes were designed by targeting the specific G gene, and the amplification product can be visualized on a simple lateral flow dipstick with the naked eyes. The amplification reaction was performed at 38\u00b0C for 20 min and LFD incubation time within 5 min. The detection limit of this assay was 8 copies per reaction, and there was no cross-reactivity with other bovine infectious viruses such as bovine viral diarrhea virus, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine coronavirus, bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, bovine vesicular stomatitis virus. In addition, the assay was performed with total 128 clinical specimens and the diagnostic results were compared with conventional RT-PCR, real-time quantative(q) PCR. The result showed that the coincidence rate of BEFV LFD-RPA and real-time qPCR was 96.09% (123/128), which was higher than conventional RT-PCR. The RPA combined with LFD assay probably provides a rapid and sensitive alternative for diagnosis of BEFV infections outbreak.",

BEFV infection is characterized by variable clinical signs, such as acute febrile reaction, lameness, stiffness, reduced-milk production, lowered-male fertility, and also death in cattle [1] [2] [3] . The disease has been reported in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia and Africa. In addition, in recent years there have been several major outbreaks in China and much more widespread, and it has led to significant economic losses to dairy industry [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Diagnosis and vaccination now are of great importance in the management of BEFV. However, vaccines at presently in use are less than ideal due to the poor heat-stability that might be incapable of providing reliable and durable protection following a single dose [3] , and further research is required to develop a rapid diagnostic assay that will provide reliable tools for the prevention and control of BEFV.",

            "text": "Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is a proliferation of next-generation molecular diagnostics relative to traditional PCR [27] . It is performed at a low and constant temperature (optimal temperatures 37\u00b0C-42\u00b0C) with the simple set-up and no thermal or chemical melting of DNA is required. The technology takes advantage of three major proteins including a recombinase enzyme to separate the DNA duplex, single-stranded DNA-binding proteins to stabilize the open complex, and polymerase to begin DNA synthesis using two opposing primers and probe chemistries. Much like PCR, if target sequence is indeed present, an exponential DNA amplification reaction is initiated. It can specifically amplify nucleic acid sequences in an isothermal format ranging from trace levels to detectable amounts of product with a rapid turnaround time. Commonly, the RPA amplification products can be detected by gel electrophoresis, probe-based fluorescence monitoring, lateral flow dipsticks depending on the specific oligonucleotide primers and/or a probe. Recently, RPA amplification system combined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [28] , aptamer based bio-barcode (ABC) [29] , and hybridization in microarray format [30] have emerged. Lateral flow dipsticks detection based systems requires an additional oligonucleotide which is typically labeled on the 5\u2032 end of FAM and conjoined with the opposing amplification primer typically labeled with biotin on the 5\u2032 end. Consequently, this amplicons can be detected in a 'sandwich' assay. Although RPA technology has been widely used for detection of various pathogens since its initial development [31] [32] [33] [34] , there is no RPA used for BEFV detection, so far.",

The candidate primers/probe for the LFD-RPA assay was screened by performing with TwistAmp nfo reactions and preliminarily analyzed its amplified specificity on 2% agarose gel with labeled amplicons. Of these, 3F/3R/3LF sets were identified as capable of specific amplification efficiency with the expected size of 235 bp (Fig. 1A) , and LFD-RPA test line showed faster than other sets within 5 min (Fig. 1B) . Therefore, 3F/3R/3LF primer set was chosen for subsequent evaluation (Supplementary Fig. 1) . Besides that, different reaction temperature and different incubation time were optimized for this methodology. The results showed that the best amplified product were observed in reactions incubated at 38\u00b0C ( Fig. 2A) and could be detected 15 min or longer (Fig. 2B) . Thus, the process of amplification reaction of the BEFV LFD-RPA assay was performed at 38\u00b0C for 20 min.",

            "text": "The aim of this study was to develop a sensitive, specific, simple, and rapid diagnostic assay that is applied to detection of BEFV infections. According to previous published reports, an extensive performance on detecting BEFV was carried out including reliable assay protocol for identification of diseases (RAPID)-bioactive amplification with probing (BAP) assay, RT-LAMP, real time qPCR and conventional RT-PCR [12, 23, 25, 38] . With respect to analytical sensitivity, the limit of detection of the assay was 8 copies per reaction determined by testing replicates of various concentrations of G-T3-RPA plasmid (Fig. 3A) . It seems to be similar to other techniques reported previously such as RT-LAMP (20 copies/tube of RNA), real-time-RT-PCR (lies between 10 and 100 copies), and higher than RT-PCR (200 copies/tube of RNA), but lower than that the detection limit of RAPID-BAP assay was 1 copy/\u03bcL. To some extent, BEFV LFD-RPA outperforms RT-LAMP and real time qPCR: on the one hand, RPA reaction only utilizes two primers and one probe and three binding sites, in contrast, the RT-LAMP assay needs at least four primers and six binding sites, a higher reactive temperature (60-65\u00b0C) [38] . On the other hand, RPA reagents provided in a lyophilized are stable even when stored for 3 weeks at 45\u00b0C, which allow independence from the cooling chain [39] . Moreover, it only requires a simple heat block to run (38\u00b0C) (Fig. 2) and the results can also be visualized by LFD with naked eyes inspection while the method of real-time-qPCR requires sophisticated instruments operated by specially trained personnel. What's more important, the study of analytical specificity is not only typically evaluated for etiologies that are likely to cause clinical presentations similar to the target etiology, but also evaluating those more closely related to BEFV that considered as potential sources of false-positives (Fig. 3B) . It is worth mentioning that the high sensitivity and specificity of this lateral flow based detection systems assay gave the credit to good use of gold-labeled anti-FAM and anti-Biotin antibodies to capture RPA product simultaneously [40] . Although some biochemical methods including the flow type quartz crystal microbalance immunosensor have been published that are able to detect of BEFV [41] , the procedure is somewhat complicated and requires the BEFV monoclonal antibodies on the gold surface of a quartzcrystal microbalance (QCM), and the whole process of this method needs to be operated by a professional personnel.",

Furthermore, it is much rapid than other nucleic acid tests at present and the reaction is performed at an ambient constant temperature instead of an expensive and sophisticated thermo cycler. However, the typical benefit of lateral-flow assays is their ability to be used as pen-side tests, this does not appear to be possible in this situation due to the requirement the prepared of BEFV genomes to make cDNA prior to performing the test. Therefore, it is possible that the performance of the BEFV RPA assay could be improved from that observed in this study.",

In addition, this methodology of BEFV LFD-RPA may aid in identification of BEFV infected individuals in beef and dairy farms. The results are gratifying but the method also requires a larger number of samples for further optimization and validation. Furthermore, the assay has potential to be a promising alternative to other isothermal methods for rapid detection of BEFV.",
