During the 1-year study period, a diary was used daily by all participants for reporting symptoms that indicated an acute respiratory infection. Participants were requested to report the onset of symptoms of a possible infection to the study nurse. A subject was identified as case if (1) he/she had respiratory symptoms with a sudden onset; (2) rhinorrhoea/ sneezing, sore throat/hoarseness, or dry cough were present for at least 2 days; and (3) the symptoms had a pattern that differed from any usual symptoms [10, 11] . Apart from a check by telephone, the study nurse evaluated the symptoms of cases during home visits. From those cases that reported their symptoms within 3 days to the study nurse every other case, with a maximum of five cases per week, was selected for virologic assessment. Cases who reported their symptoms after 3 days to the study nurse were excluded for virologic assessment to overcome false negative test results. Each case episode, i.e., the period during which a case had respiratory symptoms, had to have been preceded by a 7-day symptom-free period. During the 1-year study period, 624 incident case episodes were reported by 346 cases. In total 107 (17%) case episodes-reported by 97 cases-were selected for virologic assessment.",

So far, only two studies reported on microbiologic evidence of respiratory infection in community-dwelling healthy subjects with and without symptoms of such an infection. One study focussed on detection of rhinoviruses and enteroviruses by PCR in children and adults [15] . In 12 and 4% of the asymptomatic children and adults, respectively, virologic assessment was positive. Although Johnston et al. [15] tested only for rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, the frequency of subclinical respiratory infections in those healthy adults is similar to what we observed in our older population. Preliminary results of a Dutch study being performed in persons consulting their general practitioner for signs and symptoms of an acute respiratory infection, showed a positive virologic assessment in 19% of the controls [16] . This percentage is higher than observed in our study. However, that study population existed of participants from all age categories, including babies and children. As showed by Johnston et al. [15] the percentage of asymptomatic persons with positive virologic assessment is clearly higher in children, which might explain the discrepancy.",

The frequency of the most common viruses varies between the different subpopulations. Corresponding to one previously performed communitybased elderly study, we also showed that rhinovirus infections are highly prevalent, and can cause a great overall disease burden in this population [2] . Corresponding to the results of Nicholson et al. in community-dwelling elderly persons [2] , but in contrast to studies in more frail elderly persons as those living institutionalized and to studies with a general practitioner-based setting [7, 11, 18] , we also observed that influenzavirus infections and RSV infections seem to occur less frequent in free-living elderly people. A severe morbidity is caused by viruses such as influenzavirus and RSV [19] , which corresponds to our results on influenzavirus infections. This might explain the higher frequency of RSV and influenzavirus infections demonstrated in studies with general practitioner-based or institutionalized setting [19] . In total, 4 out of 7 patients with influenzavirus infection were not vaccinated against influenza. This might indicate the need for preventive vaccination in elderly persons.",

We obtained a microbiologic diagnosis in 58% of the case episodes. The diagnostic deficit of 42% is relatively low, as in most studies a micro-organism was demonstrated in at maximum 50% of the case episodes [2, 7, 8] . Other, partly new or unknown viruses, bacteria, and atypical microorganisms other than M. pneumoniae may be responsible for some of the clinical and possible additional subclinical infections with negative microbiology. Bacterial, atypical and viral micro-organisms in adult patients consulting for respiratory infection have been shown in 12, 20, and 50% of the patients, respectively [20] . Also, Chlamydia species are reported to cause acute respiratory infections in communitydwelling elderly persons [2] , although the proportion of bacterial infections is reported to be rare in adult patients with common cold [4] . Besides, Chlamydia infections occurred in 1% only of the community-dwelling elderly people, and were mainly analyzed in patients with COPD and asthma, while we excluded those patients [2, 21] . However, we cannot exclude that part of the diagnostic deficit in our study might be explained by such bacterial and atypical micro-organisms.",

This issue is especially crucial in interpreting PCR positive results in nose/throat samples obtained from subjects both with and without symptoms of a respiratory infection. Andeweg et al. [12] demonstrated that rhinoviruses were no longer detected by PCR in patients who had recovered from disease. In our study, all cases and controls were followed day to day by using a self-reporting diary system. It was therefore possible to include only controls not having any symptoms 2 months before and 2 months after sampling. Thus, it is very unlikely that the controls, in which a virus was detected, were in the postinfectious or incubation period of a symptomatic infection. Moreover, in nose/throat samples of four of the eight excluded controls a respiratory virus was detected, and those controls apparently were in the incubation period.",
