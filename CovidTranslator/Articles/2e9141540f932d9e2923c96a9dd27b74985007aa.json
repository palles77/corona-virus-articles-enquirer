            "text": "The intestinal epithelium is a major site of interaction with pathogens. In bovine intestinal epithelial cells (BIECs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in innate immune responses against enteric pathogens. This study is aimed at establishing a stable bovine intestinal epithelial cell line that can be maintained by a continuous passage so that studies on innate immune responses against various enteric pathogens can be performed. The main goal was to establish pure cultures of primary and immortalized bovine intestinal epithelial cells from the ileum and then characterize them biochemically and immunologically. Mixed epithelial and fibroblast bovine ileal intestinal cultures were first established from a 2-day old calf. Limiting dilution method was used to obtain a clone of epithelial cells which was characterized using immunocytochemistry (ICC). The selected clone BIEC-c4 was cytokeratin positive and expressed low levels of vimentin, confirming the epithelial cell phenotype. Early passage BIEC-c4 cells were transfected with either simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen or human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), or human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16E6/E7 genes to establish three immortalized BIEC cell lines. The expression of SV40, hTERT and HPV E6/E7 genes in immortalized BIECs was confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence assays also confirmed the expression of SV40, hTERT and HPV E6 proteins. The immortalized BIECs were cytokeratin positive and all except HPV-BIECs expressed low levels of vimentin. A growth kinetics study indicated that there were no significant differences in the doubling time of immortalized BIECs as compared to early passage BIEC-c4 cells. All four BIEC types expressed TLR 1-10 genes, with TLR 3 and 4 showing higher expression across all cell types. These newly established early passage and immortalized BIEC cell lines should serve as a good model for studying infectivity, pathogenesis and innate immune responses against enteric pathogens.",

PRRs can be broadly divided into two types: non-cytosolic receptors (expressed either on the cell membrane or within endosomal compartments) and cytosolic receptors. A total of ten bovine TLRs have been identified which are designated as TLRs 1-10 (Fisher et al. 2011; Menzies and Ingham 2006; Werling et al. 2006) . In general, TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR6 are expressed on the cell surface, while TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9 are expressed in the cell within endosomal compartments and are mostly involved in the recognition of nucleic acids (Akira et al. 2006; Werling and Jungi 2003; Werling et al. 2006 ). These receptors broadly recognize different classes of pathogens and are also important in the recognition of danger signals of tissue damage (Iwasaki and Medzhitov 2010; Miyake 2007) . This leads to the initiation of proinflammatory signaling cascade through activation of transcription factor NF-jB (Mogensen 2009 ). The proinflammatory response involves the production of various cytokines, chiefly IL-1, IL-6, and IL-18 and is a major step in the clearance of pathogens (Peterson and Artis 2014) .",

Bovine jejunal and ileal epithelial cell cultures derived from adult cattle and fetal calves are currently available as homologous cell lines for studying innate immune responses against these pathogens . The fetal bovine intestinal epithelial cell line has been studied for interaction with enteric pathogens (Takanashi et al. 2013) . Surgically prepared jejunal loops from 1-day old calves have also been used for comparative study of the innate immune responses against BRV and BCV infection (Aich et al. 2007) .

At present, only limited studies on intestinal epithelial cell cultures from young calves are available (Cenci\u010d and Langerholc 2010; Cencic et al. 2007; Steube et al. 2012) . In this study, the main aim was to establish primary and immortalized cultures of bovine intestinal epithelial cells (BIECs) derived from young calf and then characterize them using biochemical and immunological techniques. A pure BIEC clone (BIEC-c4) was established and immortalized using SV40, hTERT, and HPV E6/E7 genes for establishing continuous cell lines. Growth kinetics of BIEC-c4 was compared with the immortalized BIECs. The expression of TLR genes was also studied in each of the four BIEC cell types. The BIEC cell lines established in this study may be applicable for understanding the role of intestinal epithelial cells in innate immunity against enteric pathogens. Therefore, these cells may be a useful model for studying epithelial cell biology, hostmicrobe interaction, immunomodulation, and pathogenesis.",

            "text": "A 2-day-old colostrum-deprived Holstein male calf (Bos taurus) was obtained from the South Dakota State University (SDSU) dairy farm. The animal was negative for bovine viral diarrhea, bovine leukemia virus, and Johne's disease. All animal protocols were approved by SDSU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The ileal intestinal cultures were established using the procedures described earlier with some modification Rusu et al. 2005) . Briefly, ileal tissue fragments from a 2-day old dairy calf were collected in ice-cold Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) supplemented with 1% strepto-penicillin-antimycotic solution, gentamycin (5 lg/ml) and L-glutamine (2 mM), referred as supplemented HBSS (HBSS-S). Intestinal lumen was flushed with HBSS-S and then both ends of the intestinal segment were ligated with silk suture. Intestinal loops were filled with phosphate-bufferedsaline (PBS) containing 1 mM dithiothreitol and kept for 5-10 min in shaking water bath (37\u00b0C) to remove the mucus. Subsequently, intestinal loops were filled with pre-warmed (37\u00b0C) HBSS-S containing collagenase (300 units/ml) and dispase (0.24 units/ml) enzymes to digest the intestinal tissue. Collagenasedispase filled intestinal loops were kept in shaking water bath (37\u00b0C) for 15 min. Collagenase, type 2 and dispase-II were bought from Worthington Biochemical Corporation, NJ, USA (Cat # LS004176) and Roche Diagnostics, IN, respectively. The contents obtained through this step were discarded. Then using the same collagenasedispase digestion medium, the digestion step was repeated for 45 min and the contents were discarded. Then ileal loops were opened longitudinally, and predigested epithelium was scraped using a sterile scalpel blade. The resulting contents were incubated with HBSS containing 2.4 units/ml dispase for 10 min. Cells obtained after enzymatic digestion of scraped tissue were washed and resuspended in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM). The cell suspension was treated with DMEM containing 2% sorbitol (Sigma) and centrifuged to remove the fibroblasts (Rusu et al. 2005) . The pellet of cells was resuspended in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Atlanta Biologicals, GA, USA). Cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 90 min in a cell culture Primaria flask (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) to remove adherent fibroblast-like cells. The nonadherent cells were collected, then centrifuged for 5 min at 195 g and resuspended in DMEM-2 medium. The DMEM-2 medium was composed of DMEM high glucose medium as base, HEPES buffer (10 mM), antibiotic-antimycotic solution (1%), gentamycin (50 lg/ml), L-glutamine (2 mM), hydrocortisone (100 mM), apo-transferrin (5 lg/ml), epidermal growth factor (25 ng/ml), bovine insulin (10 lg/ml), Triiodothyronine (20 ng/ml), acid linoleic/albumin (10 lg/ml), 1% non-essential amino acids and 2% FCS. The cell suspension was transferred to Primaria flasks and incubated at 37\u00b0C for the growth of ileal cells in primary cultures. Sub-cultivation of a primary culture begins, by convention, a cell line (Schaeffer 1990 ). For a cell line, the first dozen or so subcultivations results in cultures that can be referred to as an early passage cell line. An early passage cell line can be subjected to immortalization treatments to lead to an immortal cell line.",

These cells were discarded and remaining cells were again trypsinized to obtain epithelial-like cells. The epithelial-like cells were transferred to a petri dish (100 mm 9 15 mm) at a low density of 1000 cells (passage 9) in supplemented DMEM/F12 medium. After 48 h, the selected clones were identified based on epithelial morphology and marked on the petri dish with a black marker. The growth of these clones was followed. After 4 days of incubation on the petri dish, cells were obtained from five selected clones. Sterilized small hollow plastic wells coated with vaseline at the bottom were used for separating the clones on the petri dish. Selected five clones were obtained by trypsinization and transferred to individual wells on a 24-well plate (passage 10) and further propagated. After 96 h, cells from well number 4 were trypsinized and further propagated in 6-well plate (passage 11). These cells were further subcloned in a 96-well plate by serial dilution method (Miyazawa et al. 2010) . A clone growing very well in the 96-well plate was further amplified in a 24-well plate, then 6-well plate, and finally in a T-25 flask. These cells were kept for further studies and named as bovine intestinal epithelial cells obtained from colony 4 (BIEC-c4). The BIEC-c4 cells were then transferred and maintained in the T-75 flask by passaging using the same culture conditions and supplemented DMEM/F12 medium. Phase contrast photographs of cells at various stages of the establishment of epithelial cultures were taken at 10 9 or 20 9 magnification using an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope.",

Briefly, primary and immortalized BIEC-c4 cells were cultured in a T-75 flask in the supplemented DMEM/F12 medium. After 48 h, cells were trypsinized and a cell suspension at a concentration of 1 9 10 6 cells/ml was prepared in DMEM/F12 medium. Then, 100 ll of the suspension was used to prepare each cytospin using a cytofuge (Cytospin 3; Thermo Shandon Inc., Cheshire, UK) at 800 rpm for 5 min. The cytospins were air dried for 1 h and fixed with absolute acetone for 7 min. The slides were washed three times with 1 9 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 min and incubated at room temperature with 1 9 PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide and 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) to block endogenous peroxidase activity. The cells were blocked for non-specific protein binding using 1% goat serum in PBS. Each slide was washed once with 1 9 PBS and then incubated in a humid chamber for 1 h with 100 ll of primary antibodies diluted at a final concentration of 1 lg/ml. The presence of cytokeratin, vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and desmin proteins was detected by ICC staining using anticytokeratin monoclonal antibody (mAb) C6909 (clone K8.13, IgG2a isotype), anti-vimentin mAb V5255 (IgM isotype), anti-alpha smooth muscle actin mAb A2547 (IgG2a) and anti-desmin mAb D1033 (IgG1) respectively Sun et al. 2012; Thomas et al. 2018) . As isotype-matched controls, mAbs M9269 (IgG1 isotype), M9144 (IgG2a isotype) and M5170 (IgM isotype) were used. All of these primary antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA. The mAb C6909 was specific for polypeptides of cytokeratins 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 18. As a negative control, cells were incubated with PBS containing 1% goat serum. Further, all slides were washed three times with 1 9 PBS, followed by incubation for 30 min with 100 ll of isotype-specific, biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG1 (Caltag Laboratories, M32115), IgG2a (Caltag Laboratories, M32215) or IgM (Caltag Laboratories, M31515) secondary antibody at 1:2000 dilution. The cytospins were washed three times with 1 9 PBS and treated with ready-to-use (RTU) HRP-streptavidin solution from Vector Elite vectastain kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 30 min. After three washes with 1 9 PBS, each slide was incubated for 10 min with 100 ll of RTU diaminobenzene (DAB) substrate (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and counterstained for 2 min with hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Slides were then washed in running tap water, air dried overnight, and mounted with a coverslip and cytoseal 60 mounting medium (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

Cells were then incubated with serum-free OPTI-MEM \u00d2 media for 6 h at 37\u00b0C after which selection antibiotics were added to assess successful transfection and immortalization of cells. Transfected cells were selected using either G418 antibiotic (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat.

In passage 8 cultures, mixed fibroblast and epithelial-like cells were present in some locations (Fig. 2a) while at other places, distinct epithelial-like clusters were present (Fig. 2b) . Thus, at passage 8, we decided to culture these cells in a petri dish in low numbers (1000 cells per petri dish) in order to get individualized epithelial-like cell clusters (Fig. 2c, d) . The individual epithelial like clusters were collected and amplified in 24 and 6-well plates. Then the cells from colony 4 from the petri dish were further subcloned in a 96-well plate and amplified further. These cells were designated as BIEC-c4 cells. Upon confluency, BIEC-c4 cells had a cobble-stone TLR1  F: CAT TCC TAG CAG CTA CCA CAA GCT   R: TGG GCC ATT CCA AAT AAG TTC T   NM_001046504   TLR2  F: GGG TGC TGT GTC ACC GTT TC   R: GCC ACG CCC ACA TCA TCT   NM_174197   TLR3 morphology, indicative of epithelial phenotype (Fig. 3a) . We expected that primary BIEC cells would have limited growth potential in subsequent passages so primary BIEC-c4 cells were further immortalized using SV40 gene (Fig. 3b) , hTERT gene (Fig. 3c) , and human papilloma virus HPV E6/E7 genes (Fig. 3d ). All the three immortalized BIEC cell types also showed a cobble-stone morphology upon confluency (Fig. 3b, d) .",

In the negative control BIEC-c4 cells, some immunoreactivity for the SV40 LT Ag (Fig. 6a) and hTERT (Fig. 6c) proteins was observed, possibly due to incomplete blocking. This background staining was restricted to the cytoplasm or the cell membrane. However, the desired proteins were expressed mostly in the nucleus as observed in SV40-BIEC (Fig. 6b ) and hTERT-BIEC (Fig. 6d) . The immunofluorescence assay was used to confirm the expression of HPV E6 protein (Fig. 7g , i) using the HPV E6 specific primary antibody and the Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated secondary antibody (Fig. 7g) , and propidium iodide staining for the nucleus (Fig. 7h) . As a negative control, BIEC-c4 cells were also stained using a similar set of primary and secondary antibodies (Fig. 7d) . However, primary BIEC-c4 cells did not express HPV E6 protein, as evident from the lack of immunofluorescence staining in the nucleus of BIEC-c4 cells (Fig. 7d, f) . Some immunoreactivity was observed in the negative control BIEC-c4 cells (Fig. 7d) . However, it was also non-specific cytoplasmic staining since the HPV protein in HPV-BIEC was specifically expressed in the nucleus (Fig. 7g, i) . Also, BIEC-c4 cells with no primary antibody (treated with 1% chicken serum) did not show any staining for the HPV E6 protein, confirming the specificity of secondary antibody binding (Fig. 7a, c) . Analysis of the tight junction formation and polarization of BIEC-c4 cells was performed by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) for both BIEC-c4 cells and IPEC-J2 as positive control cells every 24 h, over a period of 7 days. The resistance of BIEC-c4 cells did not increase with time and remained the same as the negative control well (filter without cells), varying between 101 and 124 X. In contrast, the measurement of resistance in IPEC-J2 cells increased every 24 h until day 5, beginning at 154 X, and then reaching a maximum of 2830 X on day 5 (data not shown).",

Further, BIEC-c4 early passage cells were immortalized using SV40, hTERT, and HPV E6/E7 genes and were designated as Ultrastructure of intestinal epithelial cells show microvilli and tight junctions (Chopra et al. 2010; Miyazawa et al. 2010) . When cultured on filter inserts, intestinal epithelial cells have been reported to form tight junctions, as evident from the measurement of high TEER values (Johnson et al. 2010; Miyazawa et al. 2010) . In this study, primary BIECs along with porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) as a positive control were cultured on transwell-inserts for cell polarization and TEER readings were taken over a period of 7 days (Johnson et al. 2010 ). The BIEC-c4 cells did not show an increase in TEER values, confirming that polarization of cells did not occur. This may be attributed to the inability of BIEC-c4 cells to form tight junctions. The BIEC-c4 cells could be tested in further studies for the expression level of tight junction proteins (Anderson and Van Itallie 1995; Chaudhary et al. 2018; McNeil et al. 2006; Miyazawa et al. 2010) . In an earlier study, fetalderived bovine duodenal epithelial cells not only showed high TEER values but also strongly expressed both zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and beta-catenin (Miyazawa et al. 2010) . In corneal epithelial cells, ZO-1 protein had been shown to regulate epithelial phenotype and cell differentiation (Ryeom et al. 2000) . It will be useful to evaluate the expression of tight junction proteins in response to specific soluble factors like cytokines or culture conditions which may enable the BIEC-c4 cells to get polarized.",

Both enzymatic and non-enzymatic methods for isolation of epithelial cells have been used. A combination of mechanical and enzymatic methods using collagenase has been used by others to establish bovine cultures from jejunocytes and colonocytes derived from organoid preparations (Rusu et al. 2005 ). On the other hand, non-enzymatic, chelating methods using EDTA have also been used for epithelial cell isolation (Kaeffer 2002) . While chelating methods are useful in the isolation of epithelial cells that retain their phenotypes, it has been found to affect cell surface receptors (Kaeffer 2002) . Also, it is unable to maintain the cell to cell interactions (Kaeffer 2002; Kaushik et al. 2008) . To overcome these difficulties, enzymatic methods are widely used today, as it is able to support the growth of crypt-like cells in organoids that can maintain epithelial phenotype Rusu et al. 2005) . In this study, collagenase and dispase enzymes were used for the digestion of epithelial cells from ileal tissues of the calf. Then for the maintenance of pure bovine intestinal epithelial cells in culture, trypsin-EDTA was used for passaging the cells upon confluency. Isolation processes, chiefly utilizing mechanical dissociation, lead to frequent contamination with fibroblasts (Rusu et al. 2005) . A recent study demonstrating an improvement over the limiting dilution method for obtaining pure BIEC clones has also highlighted the problem of fibroblast contamination (Zhan et al. 2017) . The growth of fibroblasts in cultures depends on the type of culture medium used, including supplementation with fetal bovine serum and trypsin-EDTA treatment . Studies seeking to elucidate the infectivity of intestinal epithelial cells with enteric pathogens can be affected by fibroblast growth in various ways. The study on bovine rotavirus infectivity showed that rotaviruses can infect fibroblasts, affecting the interpretation of results . The phenomenon of epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype transition has been observed in immortalized rat liver cell lines, simply by changing the culture medium from DMEM/ F12 to DMEM (Takenouchi et al. 2010) .",

Very few studies have reported on the maintenance of primary culture for more than 10 generations (Kaeffer 2002; Loret et al. 2009 ). One of the major challenges is the difficulty in the isolation of intestinal epithelial crypts which affects the population of proliferating cells. Primary colonocytes and jejunocytes from both adult and fetal calves have been isolated and immortalized using SV40 large T antigen (Loret et al. 2009 ). These immortalized epithelial cells were cultured for 50 passages and were able to retain the epithelial phenotype, while the untreated primocultures were only maintained for 7 passages (Loret et al. 2009 ). Ovine endometrial cell lines immortalized with HPV E6/E7 genes were also shown to retain original cell phenotype (Johnson et al. 1999) . Human cytotrophoblast cells and bovine mammary gland epithelial cells (bMGEs) immortalized with hTERT gene not only showed enhanced lifespan but also retained original parental phenotype (He et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2006) .",

In this study, we transfected BIEC-c4 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. The BIEC-c4 cells at different passages were transfected with SV40, hTERT, and HPV E6/E7 genes respectively to establish three immortalized BIEC cell lines. We confirmed by PCR the expression of desired plasmids in the three immortalized BIECs. These cells also expressed the SV40, hTERT, and HPV E6 gene products.

Lectin binding profile of porcine intestinal tissue for the expression of carbohydrate moieties has been reported (George et al. 2007) . Many carbohydrate moieties serve as a receptor for binding and subsequent entry of pathogens to initiate infection (Kato and Ishiwa 2015) . Sialic acid and heparan sulfate are used as receptors by many viruses (Kato and Ishiwa 2015; Mestecky 2005) . Members of the Paramyxovirus family, Rotaviruses, Coronaviruses and Influenza viruses (A, B and C), bind to sialoglycoconjugate receptors on host cell surface (Mestecky 2005) . Immortalized ras-MDCK cells showed increased cell surface fucosylation while showing a decrease in O-linked glycans and sialylation (Bruyneel et al. 1990 ). In another study, human stromal cells immortalized with hTERT gene showed increased galactosylation (Kuwahara et al. 2003) . Therefore, in future studies, it will be useful to study if immortalization process changes the expression of carbohydrates on BIEC cell surface. Furthermore, as all the three immortalized cells lines in this study were derived from the primary BIEC-c4 cells, these cells can be effectively used to study the physiological, biochemical and immunological changes various immortalization methods may induce in these cells.",

            "text": "Studies on the characterization of bovine intestinal epithelial cells have revealed important morphological and biochemical characteristics of cultured intestinal epithelial cells. The epithelial tissue is in close association with fibroblasts, also called endodermal structural proliferative units (Kaeffer 2002) . Epithelial cells are characterized by the expression of the protein cytokeratin, while cells of mesenchymal origins, chiefly fibroblasts, express vimentin (Kaeffer 2002; Rusu et al. 2005) . Cytokeratin is a protein of intermediate filaments found within the cytoskeletal regions of epithelial cells (Kaeffer 2002) . Cytokeratins (CK) can be grouped into two types: type I (acidic) which includes cytokeratins CK9-CK20 and type II (neutralbasic) which includes CK1-CK8 (Weng et al. 2012) . Cytokeratin expression has been found to be tissuespecific (Chu and Weiss 2002) . Epithelial cells express cytokeratins in different combinations which may be dependent on cellular differentiation level or certain cellular characteristics (Moll 1991) . Detailed cellular and molecular characterization of cytokeratins in bovine tissues have been reported by others (Blessing et al. 1987; Hu et al. 2009; Paladino et al. 2004 ). The established BIEC-c4 clone and the three immortalized BIEC cell lines all expressed cytokeratin, with low levels of vimentin expression. Analysis of gene transcripts and western blot have demonstrated that bovine and porcine epithelial cells in culture can co-express cytokeratin and vimentin Rusu et al. 2005; Sun et al. 2012) . Fetal-derived bovine intestinal epithelial cells in culture were found to express both cytokeratin and vimentin, and the percentage of cells expressing vimentin increased with further passaging . However, only epithelial cells express cytokeratin protein which is absent in fibroblasts. One possibility for the expression of mesenchymal phenotype is contamination with mesenchymal cells Rusu et al. 2005) . More importantly, primary enterocytes in culture can undergo a process of de-differentiation, whereby they lose certain epithelial phenotype (Rusu et al. 2005) . Also, the inability to select epithelial crypts could favor the proliferation of mesenchymal cells as compared to epithelial cells (Rusu et al. 2005) . Usually, mesenchymal cells express both vimentin and a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA). However, the BIEC-c4 and the immortalized cells were negative for a-SMA, which is a marker of smooth muscle cells. Therefore, the BIECs established in this study were pure epithelial cells, devoid of mesenchymal contamination. We performed morphological and phenotypic characterization of BIECs at passages varying from 19 to 58. The BIEC-c4 cells at passage 51 showed strong cytokeratin expression, as evident from ICC staining. We also confirmed the expression of epithelial phenotype in the three immortalized BIECs at different passages. Cytokeratin protein was expressed in SV40, hTERT, and HPV immortalized BIECs at passages 53, 32, and 48 respectively. Therefore, immortalization did not affect the epithelial phenotype for the cell passages studied. Study of both epithelial phenotype in BIEC-c4 and the expression of SV40, hTERT, and HPV proteins in the immortalized BIECs at late passages is important to demonstrate stable expression of the desired phenotypes.",

A variety of cells including macrophages, dendritic cells, and intestinal epithelial cells have been shown to express TLRs (Charavaryamath et al. 2011; Turin and Riva 2008; Werling et al. 2006 ). The published partial sequences of bovine TLRs 1-10 have been found to share homology with ovine TLRs (Werling et al. 2006) . Recently, much of the work on bovine TLRs has focused on elucidating its role in mediating innate immune responses. Mutations and polymorphism studies have revealed a difference in bovine TLRs which could have implications in the selection of cattle breeds resistant to diseases (Fisher et al. 2011; Werling et al. 2006) . Analyses of TLR mRNA transcripts in eight different bovine antigenpresenting cell subsets have revealed differences in TLR mRNA expression level among the different subsets (Werling et al. 2006) . Bovine macrophage subsets differ in innate immune response against various mycobacterium species (Werling et al. 2006) . In this present study, primary cultures of BIECs were characterized for the expression of TLR mRNA transcripts (TLRs 1-10) using two-step real-time RT-PCR. The expression level of each TLR mRNA was compared among the four BIEC cell types. BIEC-c4 and immortalized BIEC-c4 cells expressed all ten TLRs and showed no significant differences in TLR expression as assessed by Wilcoxon-signed-rank test. This indicates that immortalization did not change the TLR expression of normal BIEC-c4 cells. Therefore, expression of TLR genes suggests that BIEC-c4 cells may be a good model to study innate immune response against various enteric pathogens.",

Study of innate immune responses can provide important knowledge for the development of adjuvants and immunobiotics (Buckner et al. 2006; Villena et al. 2018; Werling et al. 2006) . Fetal-derived, early passage BIECs have been used in screening assays for the identification of new adjuvants, based on the stimulation of IL-8 cytokine, and also supported rotavirus infection (Buckner et al. 2006) . Fetalderived bovine intestinal epithelial cells (BIECs) immortalized with SV40 LT Ag were used to study the immunomodulatory effects of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) upon challenge with enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) (Takanashi et al. 2013 ). These BIECs were characterized for the expression of all ten TLRs and were found to strongly express TLRs 1, 3, 4 and 6 (Takanashi et al. 2013) . Also, increased expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 were observed (Takanashi et al. 2013) . In another study, bovine intestinal epithelial cells were investigated for TLR mediated immune response against C. parvum infection (Yang et al. 2015) . However, in this study, we not only generated BIEC clones but also studied if immortalization changed TLR expression in BIECs. We found a higher expression of TLRs 3 and 4 across all four BIEC cell types as compared to other TLRs. TLR3 may play an important role during bovine enteric viral infections, chiefly BRV (Aich et al. 2007 ). Likewise, TLR4 may be important for both pathogen recognition as well as maintenance of immune homeostasis in the intestinal epithelium (Villena et al. 2014 ). In the future, the TLRs expressed by BIEC cells may be stimulated with TLR specific ligands or challenged with different enteric pathogens to study innate immune responses. Further investigation on this may reveal more information about the role of TLRs in BIECs. Therefore, the established BIEC cell lines may serve as a useful model system to study host-pathogen interaction and regulation of immune responses.",

            "text": "The ability to generate clones from a single cell is typically a characteristic of stem cell-like cells or tumor cells. Using limiting dilution method, we successfully generated a pure BIEC clone from a single cell. Immortalization of mixed epithelial-like cells followed by limiting dilution is the usual approach since single cell suspension may fail to generate clones unless those have been immortalized. In a previous study, limiting dilution was first performed to obtain fetal-derived pure BIEC culture. However, it was immortalized with SV40 gene after a few passages due to a decline in cell proliferative capacity (Miyazawa et al. 2010) . These cells were shown to form tight junctions (Miyazawa et al. 2010) . In this study, we first generated a stable BIEC-c4 clone and then immortalized it with three different methods. All four cell types retained their ability to proliferate and were maintained by continuous culture. The possibility that the BIEC-c4 clone was obtained from a stem cell-like population cannot be ruled out (Peterson and Artis 2014; Potten et al. 1997) . For instance, the mixed ileal epithelial-like cells could have been derived from crypt-resident stem cells (Booth and Potten 2000) . Additionally, we were not able to polarize the BIEC-c4 culture, which may be due to the less differentiated phenotype of the BIEC-c4 cells, suggesting that these are more stem cell-like. The BIEC clone generated by limiting dilution could, however, change to a more differentiated phenotype during passaging and lose its ability to proliferate. Therefore, immortalization was necessary. Further, it would also be difficult to characterize the pure BIEC clones if those were immortalized prior to limiting dilution as immortalization could change certain phenotypes. Also, it would be difficult to identify whether the proliferative capacity of BIECs was dependent on or independent of immortalization. As a result, we were able to identify the ability of BIECclones to grow in continuous culture to be independent of immortalization. In the future, immortalized BIEC-c4 clones may be cultured under different culture conditions to differentiate into a more mature phenotype. Due to the trade-off between cell proliferation and differentiation, immortalization may be able to rescue the BIECs from loss of proliferation.",

Further studies may clarify and justify the effective use of these cells for studying the innate immune responses against enteric pathogens.",
