Consumed for centuries, lactic acid bacteria have a long and safe association with humans [1] . Over the past decade, there has been increasing interest in the use of bacteria as mucosal delivery vehicles for vaccine antigens. There are a number of reports of oral vaccine candidates established from genetically modified pathogenic bacteria, such as Salmonella and Listeria [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] , [6] or commensal bacteria such as Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus species [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] . While both pathogenic and commensal bacteria have advantages and disadvantages as mucosal delivery vehicles, lactic acid bacteria are preferable in terms of safety control and greater public acceptance [8] , [11] . Thus, lactic acid bacteria are excellent candidates for the development of safe mucosal delivery vehicles for prophylactic and therapeutic molecules.",

We have previously developed a protective oral vaccine for Lyme disease based in OspA-expressing L. plantarum [14] . In addition, we have recently reported that the immune response to OspA-expressing L. plantarum is modulated by the lipid modification of the antigen [15] . In order to determine if this technology can be applied to developing vaccines for other diseases we focused on the Class A select agent, Yersinia pestis. Low calcium response V antigen (LcrV) is a secreted virulence factor and parenteral immunization with recombinant protein protects mice from subcutaneous [16] and aerosol challenge with virulent Y. pestis [17] . The study reported here suggests that this system could be used as a platform technology to develop oral vaccines for multiple diseases.",

We used the FASTA program Kyte Doolittle Hydropathy Plot (http://fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/fasta_www2/fasta_www.cgi?rm=misc1), that is based on the parameters proposed by Kyte & Doolittle [19] . To assess the hydrophobic character of LcrV and ss LcrV expressed by recombinant Lactobacillus, we performed Triton X-114 phase partitioning [20] . L. plantarum cultures were grown overnight at 30 \u00b0C, harvested and resuspended to an OD 600 of 1.0 in PBS. Bacteria were disrupted with a French\u00ae press and the insoluble material (membrane and cell wall) was separated from the cytosol fraction by centrifugation. This cell envelope fraction was suspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 2% Triton X-114 (v/v) in PBS. The fractions were rotated end over end at 4\u00b0C for 1 h and were phaseseparated by warming the solution for 30 min in a water bath at 37\u00b0C followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 25\u00b0C. The separated detergent and aqueous phases were each washed three times. The solutions were then rewarmed and recentrifuged as described and the detergent and aqueous phases were collected. Ten (10) \u03bcl of each phase was analyzed on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, electrotransferred to PVDF filters, and used for immunoblot analysis. LcrV-specific monoclonal antibody 40.1 (1:100) was used as primary antibody, goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1:1,000; Pierce Rockford, IL) was used as secondary antibody and the immunoblot was developed by BCIP/ NBT\u2122 (KPL, Washington, DC). The protein bands corresponding to each LcrV antigen were quantified by densitometry using a Multi Image\u2122 Light Cabinet and the AlphaEase\u2122 software (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA).

            "text": "We have previously developed an effective oral vaccine for Lyme disease based on Lactobacillus plantarum expressing the outer surface protein A (OspA) of B. burgdorferi [14] . Recently, we reported that the immune response to Lactobacillus plantarum expressing OspA is modulated by the lipid modification of the antigen [15] . With the ultimate goal of proving that this system can be used as a platform technology to develop oral vaccines for multiple diseases, we focused on the category A select agent Yersinia pestis. We cloned into a Lactobacillus expression vector the Low calcium response V (lcrV) gene from Yersinia pestis downstream of the signal sequence of ospA, ss lcrV. In addition, we generated a clone lacking the signal sequence of ospA, lcrV (Fig. 1A) . Total extracts of L. plantarum expressing wildtype LcrV (LpV) or ss LcrV (Lp ss V) were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gels and protein expression was confirmed using anti-LcrV monoclonal antibody mAb 40.1 (Fig.1B) . As expected, Lp ss V migrates just slightly above LpV (37 kDa) given that it carries the leader peptide of OspA. We further analyzed protein hydrophobicity and evaluated the export of ss LcrV in comparison to the wildtype LcrV (Fig. 2) . In silico analysis of LcrV and ss LcrV hydrophaty shows an increase in the hydrophobicity of ss LcrV compared to LcrV, that corresponds to the additional leader peptide of OspA present in the N-terminus of the protein (Fig. 2A) . Using Triton X-114 phase partitioning of the cell envelope of Lactobacillus we observed that wildtype LcrV partitions only to the aqueous phase, suggesting that, in addition to being exported, wildtype LcrV is hydrophilic. In contrast, ss LcrV partitions equally between the detergent and aqueous phases, suggesting that the protein is also exported through the membrane and that, addition of the OspA leader peptide to LcrV ( ss LcrV) increases the hydrophobicity of ss LcrV compared to wildtype LcrV. Differences between detergent and aqueous phases are significant for LpV (p=0.003) ( Fig. 2B and 2C) .",

Therefore, ss LcrV is surface exposed whereas wildtype LcrV is not ( Fig. 3A and 3B ). Reactions with Lyz digest peptidoglycan releasing the LcrV that is attached to the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall and expose LcrV that is attached to the membrane (Lyz 30 min, Fig. 3A , or 5 and 45 min, Fig. 3B ). Our results indicate that ss LcrV is associated with the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall and is attached to the membrane whereas wildtype LcrV is not, further confirming that only ss LcrV is exported through the membrane.",

Mice fed OspA-expressing lactobacilli developed a protective systemic IgG response as well as a mucosal local and distant IgA antibody response [14] . Furthermore, we found that recombinant L. plantarum expressing OspA lipoprotein breaks oral tolerance through a combined Th1/Th2 cell mediated immunity and that this delivery system does not induce secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokine IL-8 by epithelial cells [15] . From our initial observations in the Lyme disease mouse model it appears that an effective mucosal vaccine includes antigen expressed in a native form within a microorganism that remains viable and that will allow it to interact with specific components of the mucosal immune system. We assessed these factors by analyzing export and localization of LcrV in the cell envelope of L. plantarum and by evaluating induction of distant mucosal (BAL and VL) IgA production to the vaccine antigen. In addition, we analyzed the systemic IgG antibody and cellular immune responses induced by the vaccine antigen.",

Considering vaccine design, antigen presentation on the surface of lactobacilli is appealing because there is evidence that some strains have a favorable influence on physiologic and pathological processes of the host due to their health promoting characteristics associated with modulation of the immune system [32] , [33] , [29] , [34] , [35] , [36] , [37] . Our recent discovery that the leader peptide of OspA targets the protein to the cell envelope of Lactobacillus and that the Cys 17 is recognized by the L. plantarum cell wall sorting machinery that lipidates OspA and releases the protein from the membrane to the outer layer of the cell wall [15] , lead us to use this sequence as a signal at the N-terminus of LcrV to mark the protein for translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane of L. plantarum. We constructed two recombinant L. plantarum clones, L ss pV expressing LcrV donwstream the leader peptide of OspA ( ss LcrV) and LpV expressing LcrV without the OspA leader peptide (LcrV). Hydrophaty analysis and Triton X-114 extraction showed that the protein containing the OspA leader peptide ( ss LcrV) is more hydrophobic than LcrV, and that the highly hydrophobic OspA leader peptide could be responsible for the association of the LcrV protein with the membrane. Furthermore, using live-cell ELISA and immunofluorescence assays we determined that only the LcrV that is associated with the leader peptide of OspA ( ss LcrV) is presented on the surface of L. plantarum.",

Therefore these cells are pivotal in the initiation of adaptive immune responses and can directly internalize intestinal bacteria [41] , [42] , [43] , [23] . Given that dendritic cells are the front-line antigen presenting cells of the bowel mucosa, we and others [22] , reasoned that the way in which these cells react to recombinant Lactobacillus would be pivotal in directing the nature of the adaptive immune response to the expressed antigen. When we stimulated mouse bone marrow derived dendritic (BMDC) cells with Lactobacillus expressing LcrV we observed that both clones induced significant production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-12 as compared to the control, but did not induce any IFN\u03b3. Although significant, production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was about 10 fold lower than that of IL-12. When we stimulated human peripheral blood derived dendritic cells (PBMC/DC) with recombinant Lactobacillus we observed that, in contrast to the control and Lactobacillus expressing wildtype LcrV (LpV), the clone ss LcrV (Lp ss V) induced significant amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1, IL-12, IFN\u03b3 and IL-6. This clone also induced significant amounts of anti-inflammatory IL-10. Differences in detection of cytokines in both assays, namely IFN\u03b3, can be explained by the fact that in the former (BMDC) we have a pure population of dendritic cells that do not express IFN\u03b3, and in the later (PBMC/DC) we have a mixed population of monocyte derived dendritic cells, T cells, B cells and NK cells and we expect the production of IFN\u03b3 to come from T cells. These data indicate that the mechanism by which LcrV-expressing L. plantarum stimulates the immune response involves polarization to Th1 mediated immunity with some involvement of Th2. Furthermore, localization of the antigen at the cell envelope interface plays an essential role in directing the adaptive immune response that ensues.",

The absence of secretion of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IL-8 by human intestinal epithelial cells stimulated with L. plantarum expressing LcrV suggests that a vaccine composed of this agent would not induce local inflammation of the gut.",

It has become clear that immunization at one mucosal site results in very specific immunity at distinct distant sites (i.e. nasal immunization results in active immunity in the rectum, respiratory and genito-urinary tract) and this process is described as compartmentalization of the mucosal immune system [47] . In our studies we observed that Lactobacillus expressing ss LcrV (Lp ss V) induced secretion of LcrV-specific IgAs in distant mucosal sites, such as in the lung (BAL) and vagina (VL). In contrast, Lactobacillus expressing wildtype LcrV (LpV) did not induce IgA secretion at these distant mucosal sites. The localization of the antigen in the cell envelope interface of the vaccine delivery vehicle (i. e. Lactobacillus) appears to play a role in this mechanism of compartmentalization.",

This is especially true of the intestine where tolerance to commensal flora (10 12 -10 14 bacteria per gram of colonic issue) is the norm and a failure of this tolerant state results in disease [48] , [49] , [33] . Based on the assumption that a lack of counter-regulatory immune response favors the development of type I allergy, the induction of allergen-specific Th1 responses has been proposed as a promising concept for treatment of Th2-biased hyperresponsiveness [50] . Thus, it is exciting to presume that this technology could be expanded to deliver therapeutic molecules to treat diseases that involve failure of the tolerant states of the intestine, such as IBD, food allergies and celiac disease.",

Expanding the application of our technology to Y. pestis, here we report cloning LcrV, a proven vaccine candidate for plague, in the same mucosal delivery vehicle and analysis of the LcrV-specific humoral and cellular immune response. In both systems, we determined production of systemic IgG and mucosal IgA antibody responses specific to either antigen. Furthermore, mouse and human dendritic cells stimulated with recombinant L. plantarum produced cytokines that polarize T cells to a Th1 type cellular response with some involvement of Th2 immunity. Here we provide evidence that our platform technology can be applied to deliver multiple prophylactic antigens and thus could also be expanded to deliver therapeutic molecules. ",
