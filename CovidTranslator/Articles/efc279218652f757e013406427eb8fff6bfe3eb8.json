Cattle production is one of the most important economic sectors in Uruguay. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of BCoV infections and their genetic diversity in Uruguayan calves and to describe the evolutionary history of the virus in South America. The overall detection rate of BCoV in Uruguay was 7.8% (64/824): 7.7% (60/782) in dairy cattle and 9.5% (4/42) in beef cattle. The detection rate of BCoV in samples from deceased and live calves was 10.0% (6/60) and 7.6% (58/763), respectively. Interestingly, there was a lower frequency of BCoV detection in calves born to vaccinated dams (3.3%, 8/240) than in calves born to unvaccinated dams (12.2%, 32/263) (OR: 4.02, 95%CI: 1.81-8.90; p = 0.00026). The frequency of BCoV detection was higher in colder months (11.8%, 44/373) than in warmer months (1.5%, 3/206) (OR: 9.05, 95%CI: 2.77-29.53, p = 0.000013). Uruguayan strains grouped together in two different lineages: one with Argentinean strains and the other with Brazilian strains. Both BCoV lineages were estimated to have entered Uruguay in 2013: one of them from Brazil (95%HPD interval: 2011 and the other from Argentina (95%HPD interval: 2010-2014). The lineages differed by four amino acid changes, and both were divergent from the Mebus reference strain. Surveillance should be maintained to detect possible emerging strains that can clearly diverge at the antigenic level from vaccine strains.",

Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the sampling was not evenly distributed because many more samples were analyzed from dairy calves (782) than from beef calves (42) . In addition, dairy cattle are concentrated in the southwest region of the country, whereas beef cattle are dispersed throughout the rest of the country [7] . Despite the difference in sampling, we considered the inclusion of beef cattle samples relevant, but the results should be interpreted with caution. We could not determine if the observed differences were due to the breed of cattle, calf management, production type and/or geographical region, so further studies are needed to clarify these points. Strategies to prevent NCD should be directed toward enhancing host immunity and reducing the viral load in the environment [29] . There is evidence that the latter goal is not being met in Uruguay [30] ; however, vaccination against NCD is a strategy used to enhance host immunity (48% of the calves in dairy farms in this study were born to vaccinated dams, Table 1 ). Interestingly, we observed that vaccination of the dam was associated with a reduced likelihood of BCoV being detected in the calves. It is important to clarify that the information collected about vaccination in this study refers to vaccination against NCD and not specifically against BCoV, and although most vaccines include a strain of BCoV, there are some exceptions. Therefore, the impact of vaccines on the reduction of BCoV needs to be investigated further. On the other hand, BCoV detection was higher in dead calves with diarrhea than in live calves (although not statistically significant), in concordance with previous data [31] .",

While the frequency of BCoV detection was higher from the third week of age, the higher frequency of BCoV detection in diarrheic calves than in non-diarrheic calves was only observed in the first week of life. Colostral antibodies persist in calves for approximately 3 weeks, and between the third and fourth week of age, antibody titers from passive transfer are low, and the calf is just beginning to mount its own antibody responses to environmental microbiota [32] . The higher frequency of BCoV detection in the third and fourth weeks of age in our study might correspond to this decline in colostral immunity. On the other hand, the only age group with a higher BCoV detection rate in diarrheic samples than in nondiarrheic samples was the first week of age, in agreement with previous studies in which the susceptibility of calves to NCD caused by BCoV was found to be higher in the first days of life [33] [34] [35] [36] .",

Since BCoV is more stable at lower temperatures and lower levels of ultraviolet light [37] , this might be a reason why BCoV is most frequently detected in winter [38, 39] . In Uruguay, according to the Uruguayan Institute of Meteorology (INUMET), in June, July and August (in addition to the temperature), the time of direct insolation, the vapor pressure, and the cumulative rainfall are also lower than in the other months, and the average relative humidity and the atmospheric pressure are higher than in the remainder of the months. Therefore, although we focused on the average temperature in this report, some (or all) of the above-mentioned factors could have been involved in the higher detection rate of BCoV in those three months. The higher frequency of BCoV detection in winter may be due to cattle shedding the virus year after year in the winter months, as the incidence of coronavirus shedding in nonvaccinated cows that delivered in the winter months has been reported to increase at parturition [38] . Calves born to BCoV carrier dams have a significantly higher risk of developing BCoV-induced diarrhea due to periparturient exposure from fecal contamination, and if calves are raised in groups, transmission between them is expected [31, 38, 40, 41] .",

In this regard, the strains detected in this study are divergent from the Mebus strain, as observed in the phylogenetic analysis, and nine amino acid differences were observed between the Uruguayan strains and Mebus. Four of these differences (together with several nucleotide changes, not shown), are associated with divergence between the Uruguayan lineages, although both appear to have entered to Uruguay in the same year and from neighboring countries. Surveillance is necessary to determine if vaccine strains are still effective against the new variants that are emerging, and if strains are found to have antigenic differences, they should be studied and possibly included in the vaccine formulations. Uruguayan BCoV strains that diverged from the Mebus strain were found to cluster with the Argentinean isolate Arg95. Mebus-induced neutralizing antibodies were capable of neutralizing the Arg95 strain and vice versa, indicating that the aa differences were not enough to establish a new serotype [18] . It is worth mentioning that some strains (56%, 34/60) could not be amplified by conventional PCR, despite the fact that they were detected in positive samples by real-time PCR, which could be explained by a difference in the sensitivity of the methods and/or possible mutations in the primer regions.",

One of the lineages entered from Argentina, and the other entered from Brazil, and both lineages entered in the same year (2013), which strongly suggests that there are biosecurity shortcomings leading to the transboundary spread of BCoV between these countries. However, factors that may have led to the introduction of these two viral lineages in the same year from two neighboring countries remain largely unknown. The substitution rate estimated in this analysis was 1.39 \u00d7 10 \u22123 s/s/y, faster than previous estimates: 6.1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 s/s/y [44] and 8.7 \u00d7 10 \u22124 s/s/y [45] . Both previous analyses were carried out using complete S gene sequences (the first together with other betacoronavirus 1), while in our analysis, partial S genome sequences corresponding to a hypervariable region were used, which is expected to show a faster evolutionary rate and could explain this difference. The MRCA of the BCoV lineages circulating in South America was dated to 1987, and both lineages have been circulating for approximately 20 years on this continent: one of them in Argentina since 1992, and the other in Brazil since 2000, both spreading later to Uruguay. Based on our analyses, since the entry of BCoV lineages into South America, the population size seems to have been constant, although low fluctuations can be observed.",

BCoV-positive calves in their first week of life are more likely to have diarrhea than older BCoV-positive calves. Winter months with lower temperatures were associated with a higher frequency of BCoV detection. Field BCoV strains in Uruguay are not divergent enough from reference vaccine strains to affect their antigenicity, suggesting that vaccination with currently available vaccines could represent an effective BCoV control strategy, although surveillance should be maintained to detect possible emerging strains that could diverge at the antigenic level from vaccine strains. Biosafety capabilities and biosecurity shortcomings between South American countries should be further assessed.",
