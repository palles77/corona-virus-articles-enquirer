The cause of the decline of antibiotic development is multifactorial and currently most ICUs are confronted with the challenge of multidrug-resistant organisms. Antimicrobial multidrug resistance is expanding all over the world, with extreme and pandrug resistance being increasingly encountered, especially in healthcareassociated infections in large highly specialized hospitals. Antibiotic stewardship for critically ill patients translated into the implementation of specific guidelines, largely promoted by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, targeted at education to optimize choice, dosage, and duration of antibiotics in order to improve outcomes and reduce the development of resistance. Inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, meaning the selection of an antibiotic to which the causative pathogen is resistant, is a consistent predictor of poor outcomes in septic patients. Therefore, pharmacokinetically/pharmacodynamically optimized dosing regimens should be given to all patients empirically and, once the pathogen and susceptibility are known, local stewardship practices may be employed on the basis of clinical response to redefine an appropriate regimen for the patient. This review will focus on the most severely ill patients, for whom substantial progress in organ support along with diagnostic and therapeutic",

All this leads to an accelerating development of resistance, further enhanced by the fact that the more resistance genes there are, the higher the probability that one or more of them will end up as a so-called successful clone, with exceptional abilities to spread, infect, and cause disease [8] . When this happens, the world faces major ''outbreaks (epidemics) of antimicrobial resistance''. Sometimes these are local and occur as outbreaks of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Enterococcus faecalis or E. faecium (the latter species being very difficult to treat when glycopeptide resistant) in highly specialized healthcare settings such as neonatal wards or other ICUs, hematological wards, and transplant units. With the aforementioned bacteria, major problems evolved in the USA where outbreaks occurred in transplant units on the east coast and in Israel, Greece, and later Italy. Today smaller or larger outbreaks with multidrug-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae are seen all over the world. Recently several of these clones also show resistance to last resort agents like colistin making the situation desperate in some areas, in some hospitals, and for some patients. Since there is no influx of truly new antimicrobial agents and limited evidence of reversibility [9] of antimicrobial resistance, the future looks grim. Another sign of our desperation is the increasing interest in trying to redevelop old antimicrobials [10] .",

These are based on the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the antibiotic and the application of breakpoints to categorize isolates as susceptible (S), intermediate (I), and resistant (R). AST can also be performed using genotypic methods, most commonly in the form of direct gene detection using polymerase chain reaction methods for the detection of specific resistance genes, such as the mecA gene encoding for methicillin-resistance in staphylococci or the vanA gene encoding for glycopeptide resistance in enterococci and staphylococci. The research community is currently exploring the use of whole genome sequencing for AST. The advantage of phenotypic methods is that they are quantifiable and can predict both sensitivity and resistance. Phenotypic methods, both MICs and disk diffusion, traditionally need 18 h of incubationconstituting the classical ''overnight'' incubation. However, the incubation time can, if traditional systems are recalibrated, be brought down to 6-12 h depending on the microorganism and the resistance mechanism. The advantage of the genotypic methods is that they are rapid and specific but so far they predict only resistance and they are not quantitative.",

The European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) managed in the period 2002-2010 to unite the six European national systems and harmonize systems and breakpoints in Europe. Since then, many non-European countries have joined EUCAST. Both EUCAST [13] and CLSI [14] breakpoints are available in all internationally used susceptibility testing methods. EUCAST recommendations are freely available on the Internet [15] , whereas the CLSI recommendations must be purchased. As a general rule, clinical breakpoints from EUCAST are somewhat lower than CLSI breakpoints. This is mainly because EUCAST breakpoints were systematically revised on the basis of recent information, whereas many breakpoints from CLSI were neither reviewed nor revised for more than 15-25 years.",

This obviously means that, in severe infections, antimicrobial therapy must almost always be empiric, before isolation and identification of the causative organism and determination of the organism's sensitivity, to achieve a timely initiation. Unfortunately, the rising incidence of MDR microorganisms leads, at least, to one of two consequences: increased incidence of inappropriate antimicrobial therapy or higher consumption of broad-spectrum antibiotics [28] .

Firstly, there is a potential synergy of combined antibiotics in order to maximize clinical efficacy or prevent development of resistance. Synergistic effects, however, were proven in vitro for many combinations of antibiotics, but a clear benefit has only been demonstrated in vivo in the treatment of invasive pneumococcal disease and in toxic shock syndrome. In these two clinical situations, the combination of b-lactams with macrolides or lincosamides, respectively, was able to inhibit bacterial pathogenicity factors and was associated with improved survival. The second reason for the selection of a combination therapy is the desired extension of the expected spectrum of pathogens (so-called gap closing). However, none of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with sepsis could demonstrate any advantage of combination therapies. A meta-analysis of RCTs comparing the combination therapy of a b-lactam plus an aminoglycoside versus a monotherapy with a beta-lactam alone did not show any benefits of the combination therapy in terms of morbidity and mortality [33] . Similarly, a subgroup analysis of septic patients in a Canadian ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) study comparing meropenem monotherapy with meropenem/ciprofloxacin combination therapy also found no differences in morbidity, mortality, or adverse reactions between the groups [34] . Finally, the MAXSEPT study of the German Study Group Competence Network Sepsis (SepNet) comparing meropenem with meropenem/moxifloxacin combination in severe sepsis and septic shock could not demonstrate a difference between the groups either for changes in SOFA scores or for 30-day mortality [35] .",

This suggests that combination therapy may be rational when, as a result of the anticipated resistance pattern, treatment failure of a b-lactam monotherapy is likely. Several observational studies looking at carbapenem-resistant (CR) pathogens demonstrated a survival benefit for a combination therapy using a carbapenem together with colistin and/or tigecycline in comparison to meropenem alone [38, 39] . In addition, intravenous fosfomycin has been recently administered as part of combination regimens in patients with XDR K. pneumoniae infections to improve the effectiveness and decrease the rate of emergence of resistance [40] . Also aminoglycosides have been recently used in combination regimens in patients with difficult-to-treat infections, including XDR K. pneumoniae infections [41] .",

Essentially this is a strategy that is applicable after starting a broad-spectrum empirical therapy prior to identification of the causative pathogen. Intuitively this would limit the applicability of de-escalation as a concept in MDR infections as after identification of an MDR pathogen, often the oppositeescalation of antimicrobial therapy-is required. Depending on the pathogen involved, even multiple antibiotics may be required, even with the same antibiotic class such as combination therapy with ertapenem and another carbapenem for K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) producers.",

Other studies have reported de-escalation to be safe in MDR-colonized patients [44] . This does, however, not mean that the concept of de-escalation is not applicable in MDR infections. Depending on antibiotic susceptibility, an antimicrobial agent with a narrower spectrum may be available, or combination therapy may be stopped after initial therapy. If the infection is resolving, de-escalation may prove a valid option in order to avoid further antibiotic pressure [45] . However, the value of de-escalation in the setting of MDR infections has not been extensively explored and application should be considered on an individual patient basis [45] . Retrospective analyses have found deescalation to be a safe approach when applied in selected patients [23], but in a recent, non-blinded RCT [19], deescalated patients had more superinfections and increased antibiotic use. Although intuitively logical and frequently suggested [16, 46, 47], de-escalation of antibiotic therapy has not been clearly associated with lower rates of antibiotic resistance development.",

            "text": "It is known that antimicrobial resistance, as defined in the clinical laboratory, often translates into insufficient in vivo exposures that result in poor clinical and economic outcomes [48] . In addition to resistance, it is now becoming increasingly recognized that the host's response to infection may in and of itself contribute to considerable reductions in antimicrobial exposures due to alterations in the cardiovascular, renal, hepatic and pulmonary systems [49] . A recent ICU study has highlighted the potential impact of adaptations in the renal system as more than 65% of these critically ill patients manifested augmented renal function, defined by a creatinine clearance C130 mL/min/1.73 m2, during their initial week of hospitalization. This finding is particularly concerning because the backbones of most antimicrobial regimens in the ICU such as penicillins, cephalosporins or carbapenems are predominantly cleared via the renal route [50] . To this end, Roberts and colleagues have recently reported the results of a prospective, multinational pharmacokinetic study to assess b-lactam exposures in the critically ill population [51] . In that study, the investigators noted that among 248 infected patients, 16% did not achieve adequate antimicrobial exposures and that these patients were 32% less likely to have a satisfactory infection outcome. While a personalized approach to dosing that is based on a given patient's specific pharmacokinetic profile for b-lactams is not yet the standard of practice as might be expected for the aminoglycosides and vancomycin due to lack of routinely available drug assays, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profile of b-lactams as well as other agents may be incorporated into treatment algorithms to optimize outcomes. To this end, we developed and implemented pharmacodynamically optimized b-lactam regimens which incorporated the use of higher doses as well as prolonged or continuous infusion administration technique to enhance in vivo exposures in patients with VAP [52]. Utilization of these regimens was shown to improve the clinical, microbiologic and economic outcomes associated with this ICU based infection. Clinicians need to recognize that in the early stages of infection, alterations in metabolic pathways as well as the reduced susceptibility of target pathogens may result in inadequate antimicrobial exposures if conventional dosing regimens are utilized. Therefore, pharmacodynamically optimized dosing regimens should be given to all patients empirically and once the pathogen, susceptibility and clinical response are known, local stewardship practices may be employed to redefine an appropriate regimen for the patient [53].",

The cause of the decline of antibiotic development is multifactorial. Drug development, in general, is facing increasing challenges, given the high costs required, which are currently estimated in the range of US$400-800 million per approved agent. Furthermore, antibiotics have a lower relative rate of return on investment than do other drugs because they are usually used in short-course therapies. In contrast, chronic diseases, including HIV and hepatitis, requiring long-term and maybe lifelong treatments that suppress symptoms, represent more rational opportunities for investment for the pharmaceutical industry. Ironically, antibiotics are victims of their own success; they are less desirable to drug companies because they are more successful than other drugs The current assessment of the pipeline (last updated August 2014) shows 45 new antibiotics in development or recently approved (Table 3) . Of those, 14 are in phase 1 clinical trials, 20 in phase 2, seven in phase 3 (a new drug application has been submitted for one, and three were recently approved) [64] . Five of the seven antibiotics in phase 3, as well as one drug submitted for review to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have the potential to address infections caused by MDR Gramnegative pathogens, the most pressing unmet need [65] . Unfortunately there are very limited new options for Gram-negative bacteria such as carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, XDR A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa.

Indeed on the basis of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitors (BLBLIs) and specific fourth-generation cephalosporins (i.e., cefepime) with greater stability against b-lactamases could be theoretically used to treat ESBL-PE infections [68] .

For critically ill patients, dosages of 2 g every 12 h or higher are probably preferred. As suggested in recent studies in this specific situation, practitioners should be aware of the risk of suboptimal dosage. According to all the recent data, for critically ill patients carbapenems are still preferable to alternatives as empirical therapy when ESBL-PE is suspected. Alternatives as definitive therapy could be possible once susceptibilities are known. However, high dosage and semi-continuous administration of b-lactams should be preferred. [80] . High doses (up to 24 g/day) and avoidance of monotherapy are strongly recommended in the setting of critically ill patients with MDR pathogens. Failing monotherapies with colistin or tigecycline may be explained by a suboptimal exposure to the drug; recent PK/PD data favor dose escalation compared to the initially recommended dose regimens. A small single-center non-comparative study employing a loading dose (LD) of 9 MIU followed by 4.5 MIU bid and adaptation according to renal function [81, 82] showed that colistin monotherapy might be adequate [83] . A concise guide to optimal use of polymyxins is shown in the Electronic Supplementary Material. Higher doses up to 200 mg/day may optimize tigecycline PKs and result in improved clinical outcomes [84] .",

However, their indiscriminate use may contribute to further selection of resistance and may also expose patients to unnecessary toxicity. Thus, selection of patients who should receive empirical treatment covering Acinetobacter is essential. Colistin is the most widely used in clinical practice although polymyxin B seems to be associated with less renal toxicity [97]. The recommended doses of these antimicrobials are shown in Table 5 . Tigecycline, active in vitro against a wide range of Gram-negative bacilli including A. baumannii, is approved in Europe for the treatment of complicated skin structure infections and intra-abdominal infections. Nevertheless, although diverse meta-analyses have warned about the increased risk of death in patients receiving tigecycline compared to other antibiotics particularly in HAP and VAP [98] [99] [100] , a high dose regimen (Table 5) , usually in combination with another antimicrobial, may be a valid alternative for severe infections including A. baumannii pneumonia [75, 101] .",

            "text": "The main treatment options for treating MRSA infections in critically ill patients include glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin), linezolid, and daptomycin; daptomycin is contraindicated for the treatment of pneumonia because of its inactivation by surfactant. Alternative anti-MRSA agents are tigecycline, for which there is a regulatory warning concerning possible small increased (unexplained) mortality risk [105] , telavancin, which has associated warnings contraindicating its use notably in patients with renal failure [99] , and ceftaroline, dalbavancin, and oritavancin, which have limited evidence for their efficacy in very severe infection. There have been numerous meta-analyses to compare the efficacy of the aforementioned agents in MRSA infection. Four meta-analyses are unusual in that they have assessed all possible treatment options [106] [107] [108] [109] , although only one study [107] examined all MRSA infection types (as opposed to MRSA cSSTIs). This latter (network metaanalysis) study identified 24 RCTs (17 for cSSTI and 10 for HAP/VAP) comparing one of six antibiotics with vancomycin. In cSSTI, linezolid and ceftaroline were non-significantly more effective than vancomycin. Linezolid ORs were 1.15 (0.74-1.71) and 1.01 (0.42-2.14) and ceftaroline ORs were 1.12 (0.78-1.64) and 1.59 (0. 68-3.74) in the modified intention to treat (MITT) and MRSA m-MITT populations, respectively. For HAP/ VAP, linezolid was non-significantly better than vancomycin, with ORs of 1.05 (0.72-1.57) and 1.32 (0.71-2.48) in the MITT and MRSA m-MITT populations, respectively. The data of the Zephyr trial suggested a clinical superiority of linezolid compared with vancomycin with higher rates of successful clinical response, acceptable safety and tolerability profile for the treatment of proven MRSA nosocomial pneumonia. Microbiologic responses paralleled clinical outcomes, and MRSA clearance was 30 % greater with linezolid than with vancomycin. A difference of at least 20 % persisted until late follow-up, suggesting that linezolid treatment may result in more complete bacterial eradication [110] .",

A recent meta-analysis of S. aureus bacteremia studies failed to find an overall increased risk of death when comparing cases caused by S. aureus exhibiting high-vancomycin MIC (at least 1.5 mg/L) with those due to low-vancomycin MIC (less than 1.5 mg/L) strains [111] . Outbreak of MRSA resistant to linezolid mediated by the cfr gene has been reported and was associated with nosocomial transmission and extensive usage of linezolid [112] . However, the authors cautioned that they cannot definitely exclude an increased mortality risk, and to emphasize this point it remains possible that specific MRSA strains/clones are associated with worse outcomes. Attempts to address elevated MICs and so improve target attainment by increasing vancomycin dosages are associated with more nephrotoxicity [113] .",

There are currently two main treatment options for severe CDI: either oral vancomycin 125 mg qds for 10-14 days, or fidaxomicin, which should be considered for patients with severe CDI at high risk for recurrence [114] . The latter include elderly patients with multiple comorbidities who are receiving concomitant antibiotics. Metronidazole monotherapy should be avoided in patients with severe CDI because of increasing evidence that it is inferior to the alternatives discussed here [115] . In severe CDI cases who are not responding to oral vancomycin 125 mg qds, oral fidaxomicin 200 mg bid is an alternative; or high-dosage oral vancomycin (up to 500 mg qds, if necessary administered via a nasogastric tube), with or without iv metronidazole 500 mg tds. The addition of oral rifampicin (300 mg bid) or iv immunoglobulin (400 mg/kg) may also be considered, but evidence is lacking regarding the efficacy of these approaches. There are case reports of tigecycline being used to treat severe CDI that has failed to respond to conventional treatment options, but this is an unlicensed indication [116, 117] .",

These patients require close monitoring, with specialist surgical input, and should have their blood lactate measured. Colectomy should be considered if caecal dilatation is more than 10 cm, or in case of perforation or septic shock. Colectomy is best performed before blood lactate rises above 5 mmol/L, when survival is extremely poor [119] . A recent systematic review concluded that total colectomy with end ileostomy is the preferred surgical procedure; other procedures are associated with high rates of re-operation and mortality. Less extensive surgery may have a role in selected patients with earlier-stage disease [120] . An alternative approach, diverting loop ileostomy and colonic lavage, has been reported to be associated with reduced morbidity and mortality [121] .",

Treatment options seem to be more optimistic for Gram-positive pathogens (including C. difficile), for which the pipeline is more promising; however, the recently launched anti-MRSA agents have not been extensively investigated in critically ill populations. In the field of Gram-negative MDR infections there is great concern about the therapeutic future, as only a handful of the upcoming agents will address the unmet medical needs. Associations of beta-lactams with beta-lactamase inhibitors seem promising against Gram-negative MDR pathogens, but their real clinical utility will be known only after results of large clinical trials are available. Currently, the most effective approach is the PK/PD optimization of the available antibiotics, particularly given the increasing awareness of the pharmacokinetic alterations that occur in the critically ill patient. Combination treatments seem to be important, at least in the empirical phase of treatment, to ensure adequate coverage of the patient and improve clinical outcome. However, randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to define the possible benefit from combinations in various settings. Most importantly, infection control measures and prompt diagnostics are the cornerstones to prevent further transmission of MDR and XDR pathogens in healthcare settings and to optimize early antimicrobial treatment.
