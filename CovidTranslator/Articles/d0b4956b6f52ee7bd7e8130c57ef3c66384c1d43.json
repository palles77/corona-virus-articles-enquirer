Methods: The likelihood of importation of MERS cases and the magnitude of the public health impact in Singapore were assessed to determine overall risk. Literature on the epidemiology and contextual factors associated with MERS coronavirus infection was collected and reviewed. Connectivity between the Republic of Korea and Singapore was analysed. Public health measures implemented by the two countries were reviewed. Results: The epidemiology of the 2015 MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea remained similar to the MERS outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. In addition, strong infection control and response measures were effective in controlling the outbreak.",

Nonetheless, the risk of a serious public health impact to Singapore in the event of an imported case of MERS would be mitigated by its strong health-care system and established infection control practices. Discussion: The MERS outbreak was sparked by an exported case from the Middle East, which remains a concern as the reservoir of infection (thought to be camels) continues to exist in the Middle East, and sporadic cases in the community and outbreaks in health-care settings continue to occur there. This risk assessment highlights the need for Singapore to stay vigilant and to continue enhancing core public health capacities to detect and respond to MERS coronavirus.",

Current evidence suggests that camels are an important source of MERS-CoV in the community, and the pattern of disease reported in humans appear to be the result of repeated introductions of the virus from camels to humans. 6, 7 Although no sustained community transmission has been reported thus far, human-to-human transmission has been documented in several clusters associated with health-care facilities, households and workplaces. 8, 9 The overall basic reproduction number of MERS is less than one but can be higher in crowded healthcare settings where infection prevention and control measures are inadequate. 10,11 Visits to multiple healthcare facilities with increasing number of contacts has also been identified as a common feature of clustering events in the outbreak in the Republic of Korea. 12 Thus far, the possibility of transmission from asymptomatic polymerase chain reaction-(PCR) positive cases cannot be excluded, necessitating the need for close monitoring and investigation of all contacts, including asymptomatic contacts. 13 There has been no reported transmission during air travel, and the incidence of infection associated with large gatherings such as umrah and hajj was very low. 14 The largest MERS outbreak outside the Saudi Arabia occurred in 2015 in the Republic of Korea. The index case travelled to the Middle East and developed symptoms one week after returning to the Republic of Korea. By the time the diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was established, the index case had transmitted the infection to his wife, other patients and visitors in the same room/ ward and health-care workers who had provided care to him. These secondary cases subsequently went on to infect relatives, patients and health-care workers in a similar pattern and largely in health-care settings, resulting in four generations of cases. Among them, 83% appeared to be linked to five clustering events. An event was arbitrarily defined by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as one patient transmitting the infection to more than four patients. 1 There was no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community or airborne transmission. The pattern of transmission in the Republic of Korea was similar to that of the outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. In addition, poor outcomes were associated with increasing age or medical of Korea and preparedness of the Singapore health authorities. The risk assessment was conducted by a core group of five public health officers specializing in public health surveillance, epidemiology and risk analysis of infectious diseases. Their findings were reviewed by a broader group of experts from the Singapore Ministry of Health in the areas of public health, laboratory medicine, epidemiology, infectious diseases, risk communication, as well as emergency preparedness and response.",

The authorities also expanded their contact-tracing and search activities to include the entire hospital when deemed necessary. For instance, the authorities had attempted to contact every individual who had visited two severely MERS-infected hospitals during the implicated period. The authorities also sealed off several hospitals and quarantined all patients and staff at the hospitals, resulting in a further increase in the number of contacts under quarantine between 10 and 18 June. More than 16 000 contacts were monitored during the entire outbreak with a peak of more than 1000 new contacts put under quarantine daily (Figure 2 ).

            "text": "The Singapore Ministry of Health has been closely watching the developments of MERS-CoV infections since its first emergence in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012. As a precautionary measure for the early detection of MERS cases, temperature screening at air checkpoints has been in place since 18 May 2014 for passengers arriving from affected countries in the Middle East. 19 In view of the surge in the number of MERS-CoV cases in the Republic of Korea, and continued news of reported breaches in containment and quarantine measures there, temperature screening at air checkpoints for passengers arriving from the Republic of Korea commenced on 9 June 2015. 20 Health advisories were also distributed at border checkpoints for travellers coming from and going to areas affected by MERS-CoV. 21 Temperature screening and other border health measures for passengers arriving from the Republic of Korea ended on 6 August 2015 in view of the stabilized situation in the Republic of Korea. 22 Temperature screening may not pick up all imported cases due to the long incubation period of MERS-CoV and the presence of mild and asymptomatic cases. Therefore, all hospitals and doctors have been reminded to remain vigilant and to step up their operational readiness in the event of an imported case. 20 Patients with clinical signs/symptoms of pneumonia or severe respiratory infection with breathlessness and a travel history to the Middle East and the Republic of Korea in the two weeks before onset will be evaluated to exclude MERS-CoV infection. In addition, people with a fever and respiratory illness of any severity who had recently visited a healthcare facility while travelling in the Middle East will also be similarly evaluated. (This measure was similarly applied for the Republic of Korea during the outbreak there. All suspected and confirmed cases will be isolated and managed under strict airborne infection control precautions.) Infection control precautions and practices have been strengthened in all health-care institutions. Guidance to health-care workers on the management of any suspected MERS cases has also been provided. The National Public Health Laboratory and the public hospital laboratories have the capabilities to test for MERS-CoV following the protocol recommended by to their hospitalized relatives. 26 The subsequent intense case and contact management implemented by the Republic of Korea government was effective in bringing down the case incidence. The analysis of the number of contacts under quarantine in the Republic of Korea provided insights into the surge capacity required from public health authorities to deal with such an outbreak.",

It remains a concern as the reservoir of infection (thought to be camels) continues to exist in the region, and sporadic cases in the community and outbreaks in health-care settings continue to occur there. In view of air traffic between Singapore and the MERSaffected areas, the importation of MERS-CoV infections into Singapore is possible. This risk assessment highlights the need for Singapore to stay vigilant and to continue enhancing core public health capacities to detect and respond to MERS-CoV. To date, there have been no MERS cases reported in Singapore.",
