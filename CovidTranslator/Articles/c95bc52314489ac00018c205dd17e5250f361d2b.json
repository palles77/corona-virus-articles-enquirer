            "text": "Recent global advocacy efforts have highlighted the importance of development of a vaccine against group A Streptococcus (GAS). Combo5 is a non-M protein-based vaccine that provides protection against GAS skin infection in mice and reduces the severity of pharyngitis in nonhuman primates. However, Combo5 with the addition of aluminum hydroxide (alum) as an adjuvant failed to protect against invasive GAS infection of mice. Here, we show that formulation of Combo5 with adjuvants containing saponin QS21 significantly improves protective efficacy, even though all 7 adjuvants tested generated high antigen-specific IgG antibody titers, including alum. Detailed characterization of Combo5 formulated with SMQ adjuvant, a squalene-in-water emulsion containing a TLR4 agonist and QS21, showed significant differences from the results obtained with alum in IgG subclasses generated following immunization, with an absence of GAS opsonizing antibodies. SMQ, but not alum, generated strong interleukin-6 (IL-6), gamma interferon (IFN-\u2425), and tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-\u2423) responses. This work highlights the importance of adjuvant selection for non-M protein-based GAS vaccines to optimize immune responses and protective efficacy. IMPORTANCE Availability of a group A Streptococcus vaccine remains an unmet public health need. Here, we tested different adjuvant formulations to improve the protective efficacy of non-M protein vaccine Combo5 in an invasive disease model. We show that novel adjuvants can dramatically shape the type of immune response developed following immunization with Combo5 and significantly improve protection. In addition, protection afforded by Combo5 is not mediated by opsonizing antibodies, believed to be the main correlate of protection against GAS infections. Overall, this report highlights the importance of adjuvant selection in raising protective immune responses against GAS invasive infection. Adjuvants that can provide a more balanced Th1/Th2-type response may be required to optimize protection of GAS vaccines, particularly those based on non-M protein antigens.",

The global burden of streptococcal diseases has been long neglected despite being responsible for an estimated 500,000 deaths annually (1) . Recent advocacy efforts have highlighted the urgent need for the development of a vaccine that prevents GAS-related infections (2) (3) (4) . M protein-based vaccines have been considered strong candidates, despite concerns over insufficient serotype coverage (N-terminal-based vaccines) and the association of M protein with the generation of cross-reactive antibodies linked to ARF and RHD (5) . On the other hand, non-M protein-based vaccines have emerged as alternative candidates that overcome such concerns. Regardless of the choice of GAS antigen used as a vaccine candidate, the choice of adjuvant, a significant element of the final vaccine formulation, has generally been overlooked. Aluminum salts (alum) have represented the most common adjuvant used to test GAS vaccine candidates (6) (7) (8) (9) . For M-protein based vaccines, alum has proven effective for the generation of opsonizing antibodies, which are associated with protection against infection in animal models (10, 11) .",

Our research has focused on the development of Combo5 vaccine, a combination of 5 GAS protein antigens (arginine deiminase, [ADI], C5a peptidase [SCPA], streptolysin O [SLO], interleukin-8 protease [SpyCEP] , and trigger factor [TF]). We previously tested Combo5 formulated with alum in murine and nonhuman primate (NHP) models of infection with various results. While immunization with Combo5/alum decreased the severity of clinical signs but did not reduce colonization in a NHP pharyngitis model of infection (12) and provided protection in a murine superficial skin infection model, the same formulation failed to protect in a murine invasive model of disease (13) . In this study, taking advantage of the opportunity presented by these findings, we examined the protective capacity of Combo5 formulated with a panel of different adjuvants (Table 1) using the invasive GAS disease model. The level of protection from lethal challenge ranged from 20% to 90% survival among the different formulations. We further characterized the protective immune response elicited by Combo5 formulated with SMQ adjuvant and compared this to the nonprotective response elicited by Combo5/alum and to the protective response elicited by the \"gold standard\" homologous M1 protein formulated with alum.",

One primary and two booster immunizations were delivered via intramuscular injection into the thigh muscle. Serum samples from day 35 were used to measure antigen-specific antibodies against all proteins contained in Combo5. Antigen-specific total IgG endpoint titers against all antigens (ADI, SCPA, SLO, SpyCEP, and TF) with all adjuvanted vaccines (Fig. 1A , blue circles) were significantly higher than the titers seen with their corre- sponding negative controls (Fig. 1A , black circles). Immunization with M1/alum was used as positive control in all experiments, and Fig. 1B shows anti-M1 IgG titers from one representative experiment. Survival against invasive challenge. On day 42, mice were infected subcutaneously with GAS strain 5448 (dose range, 7.4 \u03eb 10 7 CFU to 1.4 \u03eb 10 8 CFU). Mice were monitored for 10 days postinfection, and animals showing signs of disease, pain, or distress were humanely euthanized and classified as having succumbed to infection. As shown in a previous study (13) , immunization with Combo5/alum did not provide significantly greater protection than treatment with PBS/alum (Fig. 2 ). Mice immunized with Combo5/SWE or Combo5/Advax-4 showed no protection compared to mice immunized with adjuvant alone, mirroring the situation for Combo5/alum (Fig. 2 ). Mice immunized with Combo5 formulated with Advax-2 showed 70% survival against lethal challenge, although the results were not significant compared to the 40% survival rate seen with mice immunized with Advax-2 alone (Fig. 2 ). Combo5 formulated with LQ, LMQ, and SMQ adjuvants showed significantly higher levels of survival, with 80%, 80%, and 90% protection, respectively, than that observed for controls treated with adjuvant alone (Fig. 2 ). Mice immunized with M1/alum were consistently protected against infection, with 90% to 100% survival across the experiments (Fig. 2) .",

We further characterized the immune response induced by the formulation that provided the highest protection against invasive lethal challenge and compared it to the immune response induced by Combo5/alum and M1/alum. Four mice per group were immunized with Combo5/SMQ, Combo5/alum, and M1/alum, and naive mice were used as negative controls. At day 35 following one primary immunization and two booster immunizations, animals were humanely euthanized to obtain blood and spleens for further analyses. Levels of antigen-specific IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2b, IgG2c, and IgG3) were measured in serum samples. IgG1 serum titers against ADI were significantly higher in Combo5/alum-immunized mice than in those immunized with Combo5/SMQ (Fig. 3A) . On the other hand, anti-ADI IgG2c titers were significantly higher in Combo5/SMQ-immunized mice than in Combo5/alum-immunized mice. Titers for anti-ADI IgG2b and IgG3 were comparable in the two groups. Anti-SCPA and anti-TF IgG2b and IgG2c titers were significantly higher in mice that received the Combo5/SMQ formulation than in those that received Combo5/alum, while titers against the same antigens were comparable for IgG1 and IgG3 (Fig. 3A) . IgG2b, IgG2c, and IgG3 titers against SLO were significantly higher in Combo5/SMQ-immunized mice than in those treated with Combo5/alum, whereas the IgG1 titers were equivalent for the two formulations (Fig. 3A) . Anti-SpyCEP IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG3 antibody titers were not significantly different between Combo5 formulations, but a significant difference was observed in IgG2c titers, which were between 10 3 and 10 4 in the Combo5/SMQ group, while the IgG2c titers were undetectable in the Combo5/alum group (Fig. 3A) . The anti-M1 IgG subclass response following immunization with M1/alum was characterized by high IgG1 titers followed by IgG2b titers and low titers for IgG2c and IgG3 antibodies (Fig. 3B ). IgG1/IgG2c ratios were calculated for each antigen in both Combo5 and M1 protein formulations (Fig. 3C) . Ratios closer to 1 were observed for Combo5/SMQ, indicating a more balanced Th1/Th2 response (Fig. 3C ). On the other hand, higher ratios were obtained for Combo5 and M1 antigens formulated with alum, suggesting a Th2-biased antibody response (Fig. 3C) .",

The non-M protein Combo5 vaccine contains 5 conserved GAS proteins (ADI, SCPA, SLO, SpyCEP, and TF) that have low sequence variation and high coverage among GAS isolates from different geographical regions (16) . Using alum as an adjuvant, we have tested Combo5 in different animal models with various results. Immunization with Combo5/alum provided protection in a superficial skin infection model in mice (13) and decreased the severity of pharyngitis and tonsillitis clinical signs in a pharyngitis model in nonhuman primates (12) . On the other hand, the same formulation failed to provide protection using the humanized plasminogen mouse model of invasive lethal infection (13) . Given that the humanized plasminogen mouse model is a well-established model to evaluate systemic GAS dissemination (17, 18) and that vaccine-induced protection was evident in this model when purified M1 protein was used as an antigen, we decided to investigate whether alternative adjuvants could improve the efficacy of Combo5.

Both of these inulin-based adjuvants induced significantly higher antibody titers for all Combo5 antigens than were seen with PBS/adjuvant. Both Advax-2 and Advax-4 induced high antigen-specific antibody titers; however, the rate of survival of vaccinated mice was not significantly higher than that seen with the PBS-adjuvant control groups. SWE adjuvant is a squalene-in-water emulsion. The composition of SWE adjuvant is similar to that of MF59, an adjuvant currently used in several influenza vaccines available on the market (22) , which has been shown to promote recruitment of immune cells to the injection site and enhance antigen uptake by antigen-presenting cells (23) by promoting local release of ATP (24) . Combo5 in formulation with SWE generated high antibody titers against all antigens but showed no protection against GAS lethal challenge compared to PBS formulated with SWE.",

LMQ also contains the synthetic Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist 3-0-desacyl-4-monophosphoryl lipid A (3D-MPL). A bacterium-derived TLR4 agonist has shown a synergistic adjuvant effect when combined with the saponin QS21 in the neutral liposome carrier AS01 adjuvant. AS01 is included in Mosquirix (RTS,S) malaria vaccine and Shingrix (HZ/su) herpes zoster vaccine, both of which are approved for human use (26) . SMQ is a squalene-in-water emulsion containing cholesterol, synthetic 3D-MPL, and QS21. The AS02 adjuvant, also a combination of emulsion containing a bacterial TLR4 agonist and QS21, has been tested in humans as part of the development of the Mosquirix (RTS,S) vaccine (27) . Combo5 formulated with LQ, LMQ, or SMQ provided significant protection against invasive lethal GAS infection, with 80%, 80%, or 90% survival, respectively. Given that the common ingredient between these three Vaccine-Induced Th1-Type Response against Invasive GAS \u00ae adjuvant formulations is QS21 (Table 1) , we hypothesize that addition of QS21 is crucial for protection against GAS in this invasive challenge model. Given that the antibody titers against all five proteins in Combo5 did not predict protection in the different adjuvant groups, we hypothesize that T cell immunity may be a more relevant predictor of protection in this model. We next characterized the immune response phenotype induced by one of these protective adjuvanted formulations. SMQ was chosen as it was associated with the highest rate of survival after GAS challenge. Mice immunized with Combo5/SMQ, Combo5/alum, and M1/alum were used to study signature immune responses. IgG subclasses generated with the different formulations showed significant differences, particularly in the ability to generate antigen-specific IgG2c. Overall, immunization with Combo5/SMQ generated a combined Th1/Th2 response with more-balanced IgG1/ IgG2c ratios, while Combo5/alum-adjuvanted and M1/alum-adjuvanted formulations produced a Th2-biased response (28) . Serum antibodies generated by all three formulations were able to recognize and bind antigens on the surface of live GAS as measured by flow cytometry. However, only M1/alum-immunized sera were able to promote opsonophagocytosis of GAS.",

            "text": "A pressing issue in GAS vaccine development is the establishment of a correlate of protection that can be used to fast-track the licensure of a vaccine candidate (3). Opsonizing antibodies have long been associated with protection against infection for M protein-based vaccines and following natural infection (29, 30) . In our previous report, opsonizing antibodies were detected in sera from Combo5/alum-immunized mice by the use of the classical Lancefield whole-blood indirect bactericidal assay (13) . In the present study, we were not able to detect opsonic antibodies by the use of the standardized HL-60 assay for Combo5/alum. Discrepancies between these two assays in the detection of opsonic antibodies have been reported in the past (31) . The technical complexity of the classical Lancefield whole-blood assay makes it unfeasible for use in clinical trials, while the HL-60 assay may become more widely accepted as the standardized assay to investigate the presence of opsonizing antibodies against GAS. In this study, mice immunized with Combo5/SMQ were protected against invasive lethal challenge in the absence of opsonizing antibodies. Consequently, this work provides evidence that the opsonizing antibody correlates of protection paradigm do not necessarily apply for non-M protein antigens. This finding highlights one of the weaknesses that need to be addressed on the road to licensure for a GAS vaccine. To begin to address this issue, cellular recall responses were investigated in antigenstimulated splenocytes from immunized mice. Combo5/alum-immune splenocytes mainly secreted cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13), indicating a Th2-type signature, with low levels of TNF-\u2423. In contrast, Combo5/SMQ-immune splenocytes secreted a wider variety of cytokines, including Th1-type and Th2-type cytokines. Combo5/SMQ immunization resulted in strong secretion of IL-6 and IL-10 and of Th1-type cytokines IFN-\u2425 and TNF-\u2423, suggesting a potential role for Th1 responses in protection against invasive GAS infection following vaccination. It has been previously reported that SCPA-specific IFN-\u2425 responses may play an important role in age-related immunity to GAS following natural exposure in humans (32) . This observation, which is in line with our results, highlights the importance of Th1 responses (especially that of IFN-\u2425) in protective immunity against GAS infections.",

A 10-l volume of baby rabbit complement, diluted one in six in opsonization buffer, and 40 l differentiated human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) were added to each dilution of sera at a multiplicity of infection of 500:1 (HL-60:GAS) and incubated for 90 min at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 with shaking at 700 rpm.

An overlay agar, consisting of Todd-Hewitt broth supplement with 0.75% (wt/vol) yeast extract and 0.0025% (wt/vol) 2,3,5-tetraphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd.), was poured over each plate. Plates were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 .
