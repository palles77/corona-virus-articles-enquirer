            "text": "Shigellosis is an acute invasive disease of the lower intestine, which afflicts millions of people worldwide with an estimated one million fatalities per annum. Despite of extensive research during the last two decades, a vaccine against multi-drug resistant Shigella is not yet available in the market. To provide a safe, effective and broad-spectrum vaccine against Shigella, we explored food grade bacteria Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) for the delivery of conserved antigenic protein; Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) to the mucosal sites for effective elicitation of systemic and mucosal immunity. We have previously confirmed the immunogenic potential of recombinant L. lactis expressing OmpA (LacVax \u00d2 OmpA) in BALB/c mice. In the present study, we have characterized the humoral and cellular immune profile of LacVax \u00d2 OmpA and assessed its protective efficacy using a newly developed human like murine shigellosis model. The significant increase in OmpA specific serum IgG, fecal sIgA and a Th1 dominant immune response (indicated by high INF-c/IL-4 ratio) in LacVax \u00d2 OmpA immunized mice revealed successful activation of humoral and cellular immunity. The LacVax \u00d2 OmpA immunized animals were also protected from human-like shigellosis when challenged with S. flexneri 2a ATCC 12022. The antigen specific serum IgG, fecal sIgA, INF-c and IL-10 levels were found to be the significant correlates of protection. Collectively these results suggest that the LacVax \u00d2 OmpA is a promising prophylactic candidate against shigellosis. However, the protective efficacy of LacVax \u00d2 OmpA in the higher animals would further strengthen its future application in humans.",

This bacillary dysenteriae is responsible for childhood morbidity and mortality and remains a major public health problem [1] . Recurrence of Shigella infections in children also results in poor absorption of nutrients in the intestine which can lead to stunted growth, impaired cognitive development and various long-term health problems [2] . The disease burden is maximum in resource-poor settings where as many as 167 million diarrheal episodes are reported. Every year, around 600,000 deaths occur due to shigellosis, of which, 500,000 cases are reported amongst military personnel and travelers from industrialized countries. The major factors responsible for high incidences of shigellosis in developing countries are lack of clean water, poor sanitation and malnutrition [3] . While public health strategies to reduce exposure and transmission are effective, their establishment in many developing countries, especially in the context of conflict or mass displacement of susceptible person remains challenging [4] .",

Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000g for 10 min and resuspended in 0.5 mL of PBS to obtain 10 8 CFU.

On day 63, each group was further randomly sub-divided into two sub-groups (n = 6, each group), of which, one sub-group was challenged with S. flexneri 2a ATCC 12022 and the other group was sacrificed for splenocytes isolation and other pathophysiological parameters.",

Attenuated pathogens as vaccines successfully activate both the arms of immunity and provide long lasting immunity but poses a threat of reversion to virulent phenotype.

Enteric invasive pathogens such as Shigella breach the epithelial barrier and establish their infection. The presence of commensal bacteria and antigen specific sIgA resist the host pathogen interaction and invasion of the pathogen [28] . In the present study, immunization with LacVax \u00d2 OmpA resulted in four fold increase in OmpA specific fecal sIgA. The sIgA production also increases after 14 days post vaccination, following the similar trend as that of serum IgG. The presence of sIgA in fecal samples indicate the stimulation of mucosal immunity and supports the protective efficacy of the developed vaccine candidate [29, 30] . In order to evaluate the activation of cellular arm of immunity, the cytokine profile of vaccinated animals, before Shigella challenge was studied. An indicative Th1 dominant response (high INF-c/IL-4 ratio) in vaccinated animals advocates the elicitation of a strong cellular response essential to combat intracellular pathogens such as Shigella. The surge in INF-c levels ensures the inhibition of cytosolic replication of Shigella and thereby reducing the susceptibility of Shigella infection in vaccinated animals [31] . Moreover, the pro-inflammatory cytokine, INF-c, is also reported to have antiinflammatory activities along with the interplay of other cytokines [31, 32] . The anti-inflammatory properties of INF-c as well as IL-10 are also observed in the present study wherein the colon lengths of vaccinated animals did not reduce even following Shigella infection, strengthening the protective role of INF-c and IL-10 during Shigella infection. The observation of protective IL-10 induction following vaccination in our study are in line with the IL-10 role in preventing bacterial induced inflammation following vaccination as established by other researchers [33, 34] .",
