At the other end, neural networks are able to model any (also nonlinear) relationships between input and output variables.

Recently, it has emerged that cross-validation actually shows merely that a model is internally consistent, but not necessarily predictive for new compounds. The question of how reliability of models can be assured is also discussed in Section 4, and indeed several recent publications propose approaches to determine the 'domain' of models (the area in which they are applicable, see Section 4 for details).",

The performance ratio of 'state-of-the-art' methods (i.e., circular fingerprints and Unity fingerprints) to those 'dumb' descriptors can then be interpreted as the 'added value' of more sophisticated methods. Soberingly, on many datasets of actives 'real' fingerprints do not perform significantly better than atom counts (see Fig. 1 ).",

Still, if experimental data for retrieved hits are subsequently obtained, many of the 'false-positive' predictions may well be active. Second, following bioisosteric considerations in combination with 'fast follower' approaches to synthesis, it should be noted that this database contains a large number of close analogues. The hit rates obtained on this dataset may thus be overly optimistic compared to real-world libraries employed for virtual screening. Still, the two databases referenced above, which are both subsets of the MDDR, were very important as they enabled comparison of similarity searching approaches on multiple, identical datasets. We would also like to emphasize that more suitable datasets are too often -unfortunatelyunavailable from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.",

In the previous few years, about two dozen publications that focused on 'model validation' have appeared, an area which shall be summarized in this review. Finally, Sections 5 and 6 turn to the application of the methods described earlier. In Section 5, we discuss additional ways to examine data available such as those from high-throughput screening (HTS) campaigns and to gain more knowledge from this data.

Scaled bits are summed and normalized at each position. Afterward, the descriptor can be used for virtual screening.

After generation of tautomers and conformers, k-means clustering of atomic coordinates is performed. Thus, no knowledge about the active conformation of a structure is necessary. Interaction types are assigned to characteristic 'feature points' in a subsequent step, and are again subject to k-medoids clustering to reduce redundant conformer coverage. Cluster representatives can now be used for similarity searching. Validations are presented using both MDDR (Cox-2, HIV-RT and 5HT3A inhibitors and ligands, respectively) and in-house datasets. In addition, it was shown that inhibitors can be identified from a database, based simply on endogenous ligands (for dopamine and retinoic acid).",

This problem was recently addressed [12] by applying 'edit distance' measures to the similarity of compounds -the number of operations needed to transform one reduced graph structure of a molecule into another. Through this emphasis of not only the fragments present in reduced graphs, but also the way in which they are connected, better agreement with the human perception of 'molecular similarity' could be achieved.",

Some extensions of the descriptor have been presented recently, which include the incorporation of shape [21] into the descriptor. It was recognized that molecular shape is a major factor determining ligand-receptor binding, a property that was previously not emphasized enough by the original GRIND descriptors. This was due to the fact that only maximum products of interactions are incorporated into the descriptor, omitting large lipophilic features which do not contribute significantly to calculated interaction energies with probes, but might still have profound influence on binding through steric effects. Introducing the new 'TIP' probe (which is not a probe in the traditional sense but a measure of curvature of the molecular surface) led to significant improvements in QSAR studies of adenosine receptor antagonists (of the xanthine structural class) and Plasmodium falciparum plasmepsin inhibitors being observed. Interestingly, TIP-TIP correlations were also found to be the most significant descriptors in case of A 1 antagonists, showing the importance of the shape descriptor on this class. The second development was the 'anchor-GRIND' approach [22] , which focuses on user-defined features to calculate a distribution of interaction points relative to it, thereby incorporating pre-existing biological knowledge about a target. Models are found to be both of better quality and easier to interpret on congeneric series of hepatitis C virus NS3 protease and of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, as well as more discriminatory between factor Xa inhibitors of both high and low affinity. A virtual screening methodology also based on the GRID force field was developed recently [23] . This method was validated on a large dataset containing thrombin inhibitors and also showed potential to select suitable replacements for scaffolds typically encountered in the lead optimization stage.",

However, binning borders may introduce artifacts such that feature distances close to each other but on opposites sides of bin borders being perceived to be as different from each other (simply since features do not match) as much more distant features.

It was found that biospectra similarity provides a solid descriptor for forecasting activities of novel compounds and this was validated by removal of some important target classes after which clustering of compounds was overall still very stable. While the response of single targets is already a step toward biology, protein readouts of cell cultures [32] also incorporate cell signaling networks, thus stepping even closer to whole organism systems (of course at the price of increased complexity and cost involved). Also based on biological response data (phenotypic screening) a 'class scoring' technique was recently developed [33] , which does not assign binary (hit/non-hit) activities to individual compounds but to classes of compounds instead.

Random Forests [37] are an ensemble of unpruned classification or regression trees created by bootstrapping of the training data and random feature selection during tree induction. Prediction is then made by majority vote or averaging the predictions of the ensemble. On a set of diverse datasets (blood-brain-barrier penetration, estrogen-binding, P-glycoprotein-activity, multidrug-resistance reversal-activity and activity against COX-2 and dopamine receptors) superior results to methods such as decision trees and PLS were reported. More recently, 'Boosting' was applied to the same (and additional) datasets [38] , and as a general rule this new method seems to be slightly superior in large regression tasks, whereas Random Forests are claimed to excel in classification problems. Additionally, employing k-nearest neighbor classifiers, SVMs and ridge regression in an ensemble approach [39] gave significant improvement over single classifiers on a 'frequent hitter' dataset.",

Surprisingly, in only 2 out of the 12 cases did significantly different numbers of actives get retrieved (defined as more than 20% difference).

            "text": "Several recent publications have attempted to investigate what the actual scope of a QSAR model is -and attempted to develop guidelines to assess the applicability of a model to a novel compound whose properties are to be predicted [66, 67] . Two measures for applicability are proposed: the similarity of the novel molecule to the nearest molecule in the training set and the number of neighbors of the novel compound within the training set with a similarity greater than a certain cutoff. As expected, molecules with the highest similarity are best predicted, and this was found to be true across datasets as well as across methods. The applicability measures described above can also be used numerically to derive error bars for estimations of how likely the prediction of a specific model is within a certain error threshold. The issue of model validity was also briefly reviewed from a regulatory viewpoint [68] . In a similar vein, a 'classification approach' has been presented for determining the validity of a QSAR model for predicting properties of a novel compound [69] . Focusing on linear models (though the underlying concept is more generally applicable), the predictions made for compounds within the initial training set are differentiated between 'good residuals' and 'bad residuals'. Using three different datasets (an artemisinin dataset as well as two boiling point datasets) machine-learning methods were employed to predict whether a novel compound belongs to the 'good' or 'bad' class of residuals, thereby making predictions as to whether its properties can be predicted -with a success rate of between 73% and 94%. A stepwise approach for determining model applicability [70] considers physicochemical properties, structural properties, a mechanistic understanding of the phenomenon and, if applicable, the reliability of simulated metabolism in a step-by-step manner. With several QSAR datasets, it could be shown that for substances that are well covered by the training set improved predictions can be made for novel compounds, in agreement with the conclusions stated above.",

While large enrichment factors (often in the hundreds) are reported, the question arises of how much 'added value' more sophisticated methods actually provide, compared to very simple approaches, and where the gain-to-cost ratio actually shows an optimum. A recent study illustrated that simple 'atom count descriptors' (which do not capture any structural knowledge but represent a molecule by a set of integers which represent the number of atoms of each element) are able to have comparable performance to state-of-the-art fingerprints [6] . Thus, when averaged over multiple target classes, the added value of virtual screening approaches is probably closer to two (compared to trivial descriptors) than in the region of often published double-digit numbers (compared to random selection). It should be added that performance of 'dumb' and more sophisticated descriptors varied widely, between virtually no difference in performance up to high single-digit performance improvements of state-of-the-art fingerprints (which are, with respect to retrieval rate and on a MDDR-dataset, circular fingerprint descriptors).",

Using Scitegic circular fingerprints [72] , similarities between molecules in wells containing compounds predicted as being active (which may be true positives or, often, just noise) are calculated. The compounds most similar to active compounds are more likely to be active themselves; by predicting (across wells) those compounds which are similar to each other and at the same time are located in wells showing activity, the active compounds out of the mixtures can be estimated. This way, between 29% and 41% of the active compounds could be retrieved in the top 10% of the sorted compounds.",

Still, the identification of active ligands was shown to be improved by a second data post-processing step. First, ligands are docked to the target. Subsequently, predicted active and inactive compounds are subject to model generation via a Na\u0131\u00a8ve Bayesian model [75] based on circular fingerprints. Applied to protein kinase B and protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B, significant performance improvements could be observed in combination with Dock, FlexX as well as Glide scores on protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B. On the other hand, results on protein kinase B results were not improved, which was attributed to the fact that the predicted actives used to train the model were 100% false positives. Understandably, performance cannot be improved if the initial enrichments are not able to identify true positive binders. More recently, another step was introduced between scoring and selecting active and inactive compounds for training the Bayes Classifier [76] , which is one of the available consensus scoring methods. Since consensus scoring is often able to rescue docking results in cases where a specific scoring function fails, rank-by-median consensus scoring was shown to improve results for protein kinase B considerably. Other consensus approaches (rank-by-mean, and rank-by-vote) did not perform as well. This was attributed to their sensitivity to cases where one of the scoring functions performs badly.

A combination of fingerprint and maximum common substructure (MCS) descriptors [101] speed up clustering (compared to purely MCS methods) enabling its application to large datasets, and the method was shown to be able to identify the most frequent scaffolds in databases, to select analogues of screening hits and to prioritize chemical vendor libraries. A modification of k-means clustering also showed a considerable speed increase to be possible when processing large libraries [102] , as demonstrated on a dataset containing about 60,000 compounds derived from the MDDR. The desired speed-up was observed along with favorable enrichment of activity classes within the clusters. By introducing fuzziness into the clustering process [103] , superior results can be obtained compared to the original (non-fuzzy or 'crisp') approaches to k-means and Ward clustering, depending on the particular dataset and the property one attempts to predict. Fuzzy clustering assigns partial memberships to multiple classes (instead of binary values); with a log P dataset the best fuzzy parameterization was shown to clearly outperform the best crisp clustering. In addition, partial class memberships were shown to capture the 'chemical character' of a compound more satisfyingly than conventional (crisp) class assignments.",

First applications employed Ghose/Crippen descriptors in combination with neural networks for classification, and correct classification was achieved for 83% of the ACD and 77% of the WDI, respectively [104] . Later, the application of SVMs was not able to improve overall performance significantly, but the new method was able to correctly classify compounds that were misclassified by the ANN-based technique [34] . Very recently a further analysis of the drug/non-drug dataset appeared, which analyzed SVM performance (as well as that of other machine-learning methods) in more detail [105] . It was found that, in spite of problems with the dataset (some descriptor representations of compounds were, for example, identical in the drug and non-drug dataset) performance could be improved considerably to about 7% misclassified compounds by optimizing the kernel dimensions employed. An application using 'humanunderstandable' descriptors of drug-vs. non-drug-like properties has also been presented [106] recently, and was able to distinguish between both datasets with the most important descriptors being proper saturation level and the heteroatom-to-carbon ratio of the molecule. The concept of database comparison is also more generally applicable, as was shown recently when the question of how 'in-house like' external databases are was addressed in order to help to decide whether they should be acquired or not [107] .",
