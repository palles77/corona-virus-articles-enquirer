In this study, we carefully analyzed the interface in both RBD-ACE2 complexes. Whereas some of the variations may strengthen the interactions between nCoV-RBD and ACE2, others may reduce the affinity compared to that between SARS-RBD and ACE2. For instance, the change from Val404 to Lys317 may result in tighter association because of the salt bridge formation between Lys317 and Asp30 of ACE2 (Figs. 3C, 4C) . Change of Leu472 to Phe486 may also make stronger van der Waals contact with Met82 (Fig. 4D) .",

Despite the overall similarity, a number of sequence variations and conformational deviations are found on their respective interface with ACE2 (Fig. 4, Supplementary Figure S3). On the left end of the \"bridge\", Arg426 \uf0e0Asn439, Tyr484 \uf0e0 Gln498, and Thr487 \uf0e0 Asn501 are observed from SARS-RBD to nCoV-RBD (Fig. 4B). More variations are observed in the middle of the bridge. The most prominent alteration is the substitution of Val404 in the SARS-RBD with Lys417 in the nCoV-",
