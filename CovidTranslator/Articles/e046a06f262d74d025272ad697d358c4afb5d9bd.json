On the basis of analysis of this complete genomes obtained in this study, several laboratories developed molecular detection tools based on targeting ORF1ab, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene N, and E regions of viral spike genes [13][14][15] . And then the rapid identification of this novel coronavirus is attributed to recent advances in the detection of SARS-CoV-2, including RT-PCR, real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR), reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), and microarray-based assays. At present, RT-PCR is a widely used detection technique for SARS-CoV-2 and several marketed nucleic acid detection kits for using in clinic 14 . Currently, the standard of reference for the COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis is a positive result in nucleic acid detection assay for the upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and blood, respiratory tract specimens were including nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. And the patients confirmed with the COVID-19 pneumonia had 2 or 3 continuous negative RT-PCR results for nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens can discharge from hospital. However, the scholar around china indicated that cases of COVID-19 that had 2 or 3 continuous negative RT-PCR results for nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens before finally laboratory-confirmed [13].

Notably mild cases count to 94.1% in COVID-19 suffers (32/34) (Fig2.A). 20 of the 32 cases showed RT-PCR positive & CT negative or RT-PCR positive & CT uncertain, suggested the priority of RT-PCR in identifying mild infections. There are still 12 cases with RT-PCR negative & CT positive or RT-PCR negative & CT uncertain, we are inclined to consider unqualified sampling or low viral load in early stage were responsible for the false discovery of RT-PCR. Only two inconsistent cases were severe infections (Fig2.A)., indicating both of the methods reached the good accordance. Besides that, we also focused the results pattern in 93 non-COVID 19, that mainly presented RT-PCR negative & CT positive (n=40) and RT-PCR negative & CT uncertain (n=49) (Fig2.B). That is 95.3% (89/93) patients possessednegative RT-PCR but abnormal CT results. We concluded that CT scan is an morphology detection, not pathogen identification, hence, it was difficult to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 from other viruses or pathogens accurately.",
