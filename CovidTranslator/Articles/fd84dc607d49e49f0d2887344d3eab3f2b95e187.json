Here we use phospho-specific flow cytometry to assess perturbations of many different cellular signaling pathways during treatment with drug combinations that are highly effective in blocking Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection. We discovered two antiviral drug combinations act on distinct signaling pathways, either STAT1 or S6 phosphorylation, to block HSV-1 infection. We focused on upregulation of S6 phosphorylation by HSV-1 infection, and our subsequent finding that ribavirin antagonizes this upregulation of S6 phosphorylation. We go on to show that the S6 kinase inhibitor SL0101 blocks HSV-1 replication in vitro and in an in vivo animal model of HSV-1 infection. Overall, we have used an unbiased analysis of cellular signaling pathways during treatment by antiviral drug combinations to discover a novel antiviral drug target against HSV-1 infection. The outcomes of the approach we present highlight the importance of analyzing how antiviral drugs modulate cellular and pathogen-induced signaling as a method to discover new drug therapy targets.",

However, potential side effects and off-label indications are often not found until clinical trials or post-market drug safety monitoring. Consequently, this approach to drug discovery often leads to unexpected problems or misfires that delay or block significant advancements. Techniques that can determine the best drug or combination of drugs to optimally treat a disease without using conventional drug screening approaches are needed for rapid, efficient translational medicine (Lee et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2013) . Developing targeted therapies that focus on the key signaling pathways that lead to pathology and avoid bystander perturbations of the physiology of a cell are possible when looking at how a therapeutic drug combination impacts a cell using an unbiased analysis of cellular signaling (Bendall et al., 2011; Bodenmiller et al., 2012; Schweizer and Zhang, 2013) .",

The use of drug combinations is well documented in both cancer and infectious disease therapy (Al-Lazikani et al., 2012; Arts and Hazuda, 2012; George et al., 2015) . Therapeutic drug combinations work by simultaneously controlling several cellular pathways in the complex network system. In a previous study (Ding et al., 2012) , two combinations of antiviral drugs, one combination rich in interferon and one rich in Ribavirin, were determined due to their ability to inhibit Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection. These combinations were identified through a Feedback System Control (FSC) technique which uses an unbiased search based on the outcome of the drug combination treatment and can identify many unexpected drug combinations offering desired therapeutic outputs (Wong et al., 2008) . However, due to the focus on outputs, the FSC search methodology does not give any information on which cellular signaling pathways are stimulated by these drug combination or the mechanistic reasoning behind efficacy of the optimal drug combination.",

The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins by kinases and phosphatases are part of the essential regulatory networks that drive the phenotype and function of cells, tissues, and organisms, especially after exposure to a drug or biological therapeutic (Sachs et al., 2005) . Advances in phosphoflow have made studies at the phosphoproteomic level possible (Krutzik and Nolan, 2006) . Using phosphoflow to monitor multiple indicators of cellular physiology allows us to determine how drug combinations affect the intricate cellular signaling by simultaneously interrogating distinct signaling nodes within treated cells. The insight afforded to us by phosphoflow analysis of a drug combination or disease state may allow us to better design specific therapeutics that modulate the activity of disease-related kinases or phosphatases (Krutzik et al., 2008; Bodenmiller et al., 2010) .",

However, side effects and potential off-label or secondary indications for the use of a drug are often only discovered after the drug is used with FDA approval. A prime example of a virus that is well studied with regards to antiviral therapy is HSV-1. HSV-1 frequently infects humans leading to diseases ranging from mild mucocutaneous lesions to life threatening infections, especially in elderly or immunocompromised patients (Whitley and Roizman, 2001) . HSV-1 is characterized by its ability to develop latency in neurons of sensory ganglia and lytic outbreaks that often require drug therapy (Knickelbein et al., 2008) . Although extensive research efforts have been made to unveil the mechanism of HSV-1 infection, new aspects of HSV-1 pathogenesis are frequently discovered (Tognarelli et al., 2019; Sauerbrei, 2016; Johnston and Corey, 2016) .",

            "text": "The standard therapy for HSV management includes acyclovir (ACV), a compound developed in the 1980s. Extensive use of ACV, as is expected with antiviral therapeutics, has led to resistance to ACV being increasingly reported (Morfin and Thouvenot, 2003; Piret and Boivin, 2011) . As the future clinical efficacy of ACV is being assessed, therapies with increased efficacy, reduced resistance potential, and improved pharmacokinetics will undoubtedly benefit clinical outcomes (James and Prichard, 2014) . Combinatorial drugs often provide better efficacy with reduced individual drug doses compared to treatment with a single drug (Silva et al., 2016; Nowak-Sliwinska et al., 2016; Weiss et al., 2015; Ding et al., 2014) . As mentioned above, two distinct drug combinations identified through the FSC technique (a mixture of ACV with either ribavirin (RIB) or interferons (IFNs)) could both effectively inhibit HSV-1 infection (Ding et al., 2012) . Though both drug combinations were effective in reducing HSV-1 infection, the underlying mechanisms as to why these particular drug combinations were so potent have not been fully explored. In this study, infected cells treated with either the RIB-rich drug combination or the IFN-rich drug combination were compared side-by-side using phosphoflow technology to determine how these drug combinations affect cellular signaling networks. By not focusing on one set pathway of cellular signaling we used an unbiased approach looking across various signaling nodes in cells to better understand the antiviral mechanisms of these two drug combinations and directly identify cellular signaling pathways that are critical in the control of HSV-1 replication. This study demonstrates the power of using this approach to analyze drug combinations and how to translate the findings. Importantly, we also directly translate our findings into the signaling changes involved in the HSV-1 infection to directly target those changes with antiviral therapies.",

However, analysis of these panels of signaling nodes revealed that levels of phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1) and phosphorylated S6 (pS6) were noticeably regulated by treatment with different drug combinations (Fig. 1A) . Sixteen hours after drug treatment, we found that stimulation with individual revealed that, as expected, Interferons including IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 induced upregulation of pSTAT1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B, left  panel, yellow histograms) . In addition, we see that most of the drugs individually cause minimal to no change to the high levels of pS6 proteins, except the higher dose of Ribavirin (Fig. 1B, right panel, black histogram). The optimal combinations followed these key individual drugs with the IFN-rich treatments (Optimal_A) inducing increased levels of pSTAT1 but induced no obvious changes in pS6 (Fig. 1C) . Conversely, RIB-rich treatments (Optimal_B) decreased levels of pS6 but induced no obvious changes in pSTAT1 (Fig. 1C) .

Percent infection plotted against pS6 levels revealed that viral infection followed a log-linear relationship with pS6 level (Fig. 5E) .

To evaluate the effect of down-regulating the S6 pathway on HSV-1 replication we looked at viral replication 16 h after treatment with SL0101. At 50 \u03bcM of SL0101 there is a slightly decreased GFP level in +HSV-1 samples, while SL0101 at 100 \u03bcM or RIB at 100 \u03bcM profoundly decrease the viral infection level (Fig. 6A) . We also examined the effects of these treatments on pAKT, pERK, pMAPKAPK2, p-p38, p-p70, p-p90 RSK , pS6, pSTAT1, and pSTAT3. When HSV-1 was not present, RIB and SL0101 both showed general signaling regulation across multiple pathways. With viral stimulation, however, SL0101 at 25 and 50 \u03bcM no longer resulted in dramatic signaling regulation. This result shows that HSV-1 infection could overcome changes induced by low dose SL0101. However, at 100 \u03bcM, SL0101 treatment resulted in a general decrease in signaling across multiple pathways. RIB at 100 \u03bcM appeared to be much more specific in signaling regulation, as only pS6 was significantly downregulated (Fig. 6B) . -infection) , pAKT, pMAPKAPK2, pNF\u0138B, pS6 and pSTAT1 were found to be involved during the viral infection and inhibition process.

SL0101 inhibited pS6 at 50 \u03bcM when virus was absent, but it was not effective at that dose when virus was present (Fig. 6C) . When virus was present, SL0101 only down-regulated pS6 at 100 \u03bcM. Furthermore, with HSV infection present, SL0101 did not obviously reduce viral infection levels at 50 \u03bcM, but infection levels were diminished at 100 \u03bcM.

In addition, this acts as a proof of principle that our platform can determine key signaling nodes that should be manipulated as therapy of disease. Fig. 7A depicts our setup of a model of HSV-1 vaginal infection in mice. To ensure that the animal model could be used to evaluate HSV-1 inhibition efficacy in vivo, we first tested ACV alone and drug combination Optimal_B (RIB-rich treatments). Mice treated with ACV showed decreased HSV-1 viral load, especially on day 3. Remarkably, mice treated with drug combination Optimal_B had HSV-1 levels that were 70-fold lower than those of untreated mice on day 3 (Fig. 7B ).

While HSV-1 infection can be well controlled by currently available antivirals, we must develop alternative therapeutic strategies due to several reasons. These reasons include the appearance of anti-viral resistant strains, the possibility of HSV-1 inducing enhanced disease in immunocompromised individuals, and the lack of an effective HSV-1 vaccine. Here we analyze cellular signaling on a system level to determine how antiviral drug combinations modulate many different pathways and discovered that they have different molecular signatures when assayed by phosphoflow. Our results reveal that HSV-1 infection can be targeted using antivirals that modulate one of two pathways: STAT1 or S6. Combinations containing RIB cause changes in S6 phosphorylation, whereas IFN-containing combinations lead to changes in STAT1 phosphorylation. STAT1 is a well-known cellular inducer of the antiviral state (Horvath and Darnell, 1996; Liu et al., 2012) .

Using this focus, we used a small molecule (SL0101), an inhibitor of an S6 kinase that can reduce S6 phosphorulation and thereby mimic the efficacy of one of the drug combination by lowering S6 phosphorylation.

This finding is important because it underscores that regulation of S6 phosphorylation occurs in cells with and without viral infection. Consequently, the consequences of changing the phosphorylation state of a key ribosomal protein by any drug may be immense. We did not see any obvious changes in cellular morphology nor changes in cell viability as assessed by MTT assay when cells were treated with SL0101, suggesting that minimal cellular toxicity was induced by the SL0101.

Unlike drug combination Optimal_B, which started to show strong an anti-HSV-1 effect on day 2, SL0101 took longer (day 3) to induce viral inhibition.
