Exceptions include the setting of known epidemics where large numbers of cases may present with a similar clinical picture; during the smallpox eradication campaign, photographs of the distinctive rash of smallpox were distributed to allow field workers to institute immediate containment measures. However, accurate virus diagnosis nearly always requires laboratory testing. The past few decades have seen a major revolution in the operation of virus diagnostic laboratories, and their role in the clinical management of patients has become vital.

            "text": "1. The appropriate management of the patient depends on knowledge that follows from the diagnosis. Specific management does not always include, or stop at, chemotherapy. A rapid, specific, and accurate diagnosis can often avoid the need for further unnecessary tests, limit unnecessary or continuing antibiotic use (e.g., in cases of meningitis), ensure quicker management of patients, allow a more informed prognosis, and save on costs. Furthermore, specific active management measures may be indicated. The management of needlestick injuries to medical staff, screening of donated organs before transplantation, and application of blood isolation precautions for particular surgical procedures, are all highly dependent on the testing for blood-borne viruses. Cesarean section may be advisable if a woman has primary genital herpes at the time of delivery. Special care and education are required for a baby with congenital defects attributable to rubella or cytomegalovirus. Pregnancy termination is recommended if rubella is diagnosed in the first trimester of pregnancy. 2. Use of antiviral agents usually requires accurate laboratory identification of the infecting virus. In some chronic diseases, for example, those caused by HIV and hepatitis B virus, decisions about when to initiate therapy require a full understanding of clinical and laboratory findings. Drug combinations appropriate for each patient are selected and later modified based on the drug resistance profile of the infecting virus strain. Results of virus load testing are used to monitor the response to therapy and guide changes to therapy. 3. Infections may demand public health measures to prevent spread to others. For instance, blood banks routinely screen for HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses that may be present in blood donated by symptomless carriers. Since herpes simplex virus type 2 is readily transmissible to sexual partners, in some settings contact tracing helps protect sexual partners. Nosocomial infections (e.g., varicella, measles), often in epidemic form, may create havoc in a leukemia ward of a children's hospital, unless hyperimmune IgG is promptly administered to potential contacts following diagnosis of the sentinel case. Documentation of a novel strain of influenza virus may herald the start of a major epidemic against which vulnerable older members of the community should be immunized. Positive identification of a particular arbovirus in a case of encephalitis enables authorities to promulgate warnings and initiate appropriate mosquito control measures. Introduction of a dangerous exotic disease demands containment and surveillance, and so on. 4. Surveillance of viral infections may shed light as to the significance, natural history, and prevalence of a virus in the community, allowing control measures to",

Clearly, the clinical sample must be taken from the right place at the right time. The right time is as soon as possible after the patient first presents, because virus is usually present in maximum concentration at about the time symptoms first develop, and then declines during the ensuing days. Samples taken as a last resort after days or weeks of empirical treatment (e.g., antibiotic therapy) are almost invariably useless. The site from which the specimen is collected will depend on the clinical symptoms and signs, together with knowledge of the pathogenesis of the suspected disease. As a general rule the epithelial surface that constitutes the portal of entry and the primary site of viral replication is usually the best site for obtaining samples (Table 10 .2). The key specimen in respiratory infections as well as in many generalized infections, is a nasal or throat swab, or in the case of a young child a nasopharyngeal aspirate in which mucus is drawn from the back of the nose and throat into a mucus trap using a vacuum pump.

It enables a single copy of any gene sequence to be enzymatically amplified in vitro at least a million-fold within a few hours. Thus viral DNA extracted from a very small number of virions or infected cells can be amplified to the point where it can be readily identified. PCR can also be used to detect viral RNA by including a preliminary step in which reverse transcriptase is used to convert RNA to DNA. It is not necessary or usual to amplify the whole genome, but it is necessary to know at least sufficient nucleotide sequence in order to synthesize two oligonucleotide primers, usually about 20 residues in length, that hybridize to opposite strands of the target DNA and flank the region one chooses to amplify. The two primers (sometimes known as \"forward\" and \"reverse\" primers) provide the DNA polymerase with an initiation point to which additional nucleotides can be attached, and also attach the reaction to the specific DNA target region. Primers can be synthesized containing attached ligands or molecular tags, thereby generating tagged DNA product molecules to facilitate further analysis. Computer programs can be used to design optimum primer sets and to predict optimal PCR reaction conditions, for example, time/temperature/ionic conditions. Where the target might be expected to show variability at a particular site, \"degenerate\" primers containing different bases at that site can be synthesized to ensure all variants are detected.",

The synthesis reaction is catalyzed by DNA polymerase added to the reaction. The primer extension products from the first cycle act as templates in a second reaction, and the cycle of melting, primer binding, and primer extension are repeated many times. The number of DNA copies increases exponentially. Thus after 30 cycles the number of DNA copies, beginning with a single copy of the target sequence, is theoretically 2 30 or 1 billion, and in practice over 1 million can be achieved. Forty cycles can be completed in less than an hour depending on reaction volumes and method, and by a suitable automated thermal cycling device. The amplified DNA may be detected either as a stained band of correct molecular weight on agarose gel electrophoresis, or by hybridization with labeled DNA or RNA probes culminating in any of a wide variety of readout systems. However the development of real-time detection systems (see below) has revolutionized the speed and quantitative accuracy of the method and greatly helped reduce false-positive reactions due to contamination.",

Use of \"nested\" PCR reactions, whereby a second amplification is carried out with primers internal to the initial target after the initial PCR amplification of a target sequence. This can greatly increase sensitivity, albeit at the potential cost of increasing the risk of falsepositive reactions; 3. Due to the detection of trace amounts of DNA sequence with extreme sensitivity, early PCR results suffered from regular problems of environmental contamination with DNA products leading to false-positive results. The procedure developed a reputation for unreliability, and laboratories went to heroic efforts to prevent reaction contamination, including stringent physical segregation of the different steps in the procedure. This has become far less of a problem with recent advances, in particular the use of real-time detection methods; 4. Real-time PCR testing. This method for detecting PCR products required the development of a thermocycler with an inbuilt fluorimeter allowing measurement of newly synthesized PCR products in the reaction tube as were accumulating, that is, in real time. The reaction products can be detected by dyes that fluoresce when bound non-specifically to any double-stranded DNA, for example, SYBR Green; or by sequence-specific reporter probes (EgTaqMan) containing a fluorescent reporter at one end and a fluorescence quencher at the other, that bind specifically to newly synthesized target sequences leading to loss of quenching and emission of a quantitative fluorescence signal. As the reaction progresses, the intensity of the fluorescent signal is continually monitored and plotted, generating curves the position of which reflects the original concentration of target. This approach has largely replaced other methods for product detection because it does not require the reaction tube to be opened once the reaction has started, thereby minimizing contamination, it achieves excellent quantitative measurements, is more sensitive than earlier detection systems, and if a sequence-specific reporter probe is used it has improved specificity because only the target sequence and no other non-specific DNA molecules is detected; 5. Development of more accurate quantitation. Realtime detection methods allow generation of standard curves the position of which corresponds to the original concentration of target, and an unrelated copy number control can be included in the reaction to detect any non-specific inhibition of the enzyme reaction. With a number of infections, the clinical interpretation and management are now dependent on regular quantitation of the patient's \"viral load\"; 6. Use of multiplex PCR. Once different fluorescent probes became available for PCR product detection, it became possible to include different sets of primers bearing different fluorescent labels for different targets in the same reaction, and thereby to detect a number of different products simultaneously. This is exploited in a number of standard protocols for specific sites, for example, respiratory virus infections ( Fig. 10.6 ).",

The binding of a labeled sequence is detected by laser scanning of the chip and software programs that assess the strength of the binding. From the map position of the reacting oligonucleotides, the software identifies the virus in the clinical sample. This type of test was used to initially determine that the virus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was a coronavirus. With knowledge of the oligonucleotide sequences that bind an unknown virus, primers can be made to eventually determine the entire nucleotide sequence of the virus.

Similar approaches have been described for the simultaneous detection and typing of human papillomavirus sequences in routine clinical specimens.

However, obtaining a partial sequence from PCR products is widely used and has replaced earlier molecular approaches such as restriction mapping of DNA products and oligonucleotide fingerprinting. For example, the resistance of a patient's circulating HIV to the commonly used anti-retroviral drugs is predicted from the pattern of resistance-associated point mutations in the sequence of the viral polymerase. This can be determined from the sequence of the patient's HIV PCR product, which is then compared with commercially available sequence databases to correlate polymerase sequence with drug resistance phenotype. The result is used to plan the patient's individualized drug regimen or to modify a drug regimen to which the patient's virus has become resistant. Because different rabies virus sequence variants have segregated according to geographical region and animal host species, sequencing of rabies virus recovered from a patient can be used to determine the origin of the infection. In order to investigate an apparent cluster of HIV patients who may or may not have acquired their infection from a common source, for example, a single medical practice or surgeon or a common sexual partner, partial sequences of their viruses (1) blocked attachment-binding of antibody molecules to virus results in steric interference with virus-receptor binding, (2) blocked endocytosis-antibody molecules binding to the capsid can alter the capsid structure, affecting the process of endocytosis, (3) blocked uncoating-antibodies bound to the incoming particle fix the capsid in a stable conformation so that pH-dependent uncoating is not possible, (4) blocked uncoating inside the cell-antibodies themselves may be taken up by endocytosis and interact with virions inside the cell after infection starts, (5) aggregation-because all antibodies are divalent, they can aggregate virus particles, facilitating their destruction by phagocytes. Any or all of these mechanisms may operate in quantitative neutralization assays. Virus neutralization assays may be used to measure the titer of neutralizing antibody in clinical samples, by reacting a standard virus inoculum with different dilutions of serum. There are many other variations, for example, known antisera to different virus serotypes may be used to identify the serotype of a new virus isolate; tests may be run in cell cultures with cytopathic effect or plaque endpoints, or in animals when necessary, and many steps may be automated. can be compared with the usual random sequence variation seen in that population, to assess the likelihood that this truly represents common source infection.",

Blood is collected in the absence of anticoagulants and given time to clot, and then the serum is separated. Acute and convalescent serum samples should be tested simultaneously. For certain tests that measure inhibition of some biological function of a virus, for example, virus neutralization or hemagglutination-inhibition, the sera must first be inactivated by heating at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes and sometimes treated by additional methods, in order to destroy various types of non-specific inhibitors of infectivity or hemagglutination, respectively. Prior treatment of the serum is not generally required for assays that simply measure antigenantibody binding, such as EIA, RIA, Western blot, latex agglutination, immunofluorescence, or immunodiffusion. The paired sera are then titrated for antibodies using any of a wide range of available serological techniques. Demonstration of a significant rise in antibody titer (conventionally, a four-fold rise when titrating the test serum as two-fold dilutions) is taken as proof of \"seroconversion,\" that is, acute infection with the agent in question. In practice, there are many subtleties in the interpretation of results. For example, the timing of the collection of the paired sera in relation to the date of onset of illness must be carefully assessed to allow for inappropriate sample timing. Moreover, an individual with immunity due to prior infection or immunization may undergo a second or reinfection, often of a subclinical nature, but showing a rise in antibody titer. It is obvious that in reality, two welltimed paired sera to allow demonstration of a four-fold rise in titer, are often not available. Attempts are sometimes made to infer that a recent infection has occurred, on the basis of one serum sample containing a relatively high antibody titer; indeed laboratories may issue guidelines about what titer of antibody in a single serum may imply recent infection. In practice this is often unreliable, as the peak antibody titer seen in the convalescent stage of an infection can vary significantly from person to person.",

In attempting to interpret whether a virus that has been isolated is related to a patient's disease, one must be guided by the following considerations. First, the site from which the virus was isolated is important. For example, one would be quite confident about the etiological significance of herpes simplex virus isolated from a sample of brain tissue, or of mumps virus isolated from the CSF of a patient with meningitis, because these sites are usually sterile without any normal bacterial or viral flora. On the other hand, an echovirus recovered from the feces, or herpes simplex virus from the throat, may not necessarily be causing any pathology as such viruses are often associated with unapparent infections. Second, knowledge that the virus and the disease in question are often causally associated engenders confidence that the isolate is significant.In addition to the obvious issue of diagnosing the cause of a patient's illness, it is very important to remember that laboratory diagnostic methods are used to answer many other significant clinical and public health questions (see Box 10.3).A number of very important practical issues should not be forgotten as these can seriously interfere with the reliability of laboratory results for a given clinical situation. These include:1. Contamination of the sample with extraneous viruses or nucleic acids, unrelated to the disease being investigated. This may occur at any stage in the diagnostic chain, from collection of the sample through to the final stage of the test procedure; 2. False-positive and false-negative results may occur with any test, for numerous reasons including sensitivity and specificity; 3. Mix-up of samples, labeling errors. Laboratories frequently build in system checks to detect such errors.Frequently, laboratories will include a requirement for confirmation by repeat testing in the case of results that are subject to particular significance or unreliability.",

Potentially hazardous procedures are described in Table 10 .4. In many countries, including the United States, European Union, Canada, and Australia, pathogens are classified into categories 1 to 4 based on properties of pathogenicity, transmissibility, host range, the availability of treatment and vaccination, etc. These categories are endorsed by the World Health Organization. An appropriate level of containment and handling practice is specified for each risk category, ranging from Biosafety level 1 (BSL 1)-standard microbiological practice-for category 1 organisms, through to BSL 4-maximum security facilities and containment protocols-for category 4 viruses and organisms. In research laboratories, work usually involves known agents where the hazards are predictable and safety procedures appropriate to the level of hazard can be applied. However, diagnostic laboratories accept human samples of unknown infective status that are in a practical sense an extension of the patient. These may contain HIV, hepatitis",
