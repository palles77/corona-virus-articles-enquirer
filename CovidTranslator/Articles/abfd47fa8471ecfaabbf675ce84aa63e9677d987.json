            "text": "To deal with donor-derived infections in organ transplant recipients, we have to take into account the two sides of the same coin. In one side we have safety, as it is the most important issue to care about. On the other side, organ shortage is, nowadays, the most important barrier for a successful transplantation. Actually, many patients die while they are awaiting a life-saving transplantation, so any policy regarding the risk for infection transmission through organ transplantation should minimize adverse events but maximizing the availability of life-saving organs. Transmission of infection has been clearly documented via organ and tissue allografts. Organ donors need to be adequately screened for the presence of latent or active infections that may be transmitted through transplantation. A first step in the screening process is a complete medical and social history including travel and epidemiological exposure. Additionally, several microbiological screening tests should be used in the evaluation of an organ donor as it has been stated by some recent scientific guidelines and national and international regulations. The parameters for the election of these assays should be based on clinical parameters. Increased sensitivity may incur false positive assay results result in discarding of uninfected donor tissues. However, the transmission of potentially fatal or life threatening diseases requires selection of an assay that optimizes sensitivity. Decisions must be based on the urgency of transplantation, the availability of alternate therapies or grafts, and of treatments for the disease screened. Some documented infections preclude organ donation (HIV, uncontrolled sepsis, rabies, etc), but many others (cytomegalovirus, most bacterial infections, HCV, HBV, etc) do not stop the organ donation process, but may modify the election of the recipient or to treat the recipient with the adequate antimicrobial therapy. It s clear that a mandatory and timely reporting of transmission events to procurement organizations and public health authorities is crucial in the management of donor-derived infections. Clinicians require education on reportable events including specified clinical syndromes and the mechanisms available for these reports. In general, allograft recipients with evidence of unexplained infection early after graft placement, with recovery or recognition of common or unusual organisms, or with uncommon clinical syndromes merit reporting.",

For many years these methods have been used primarily for research and surveillance of national and local susceptibility patterns in order to choose appropriate antimicrobial agents for empirical therapy. However, as increasing resistance has been observed for many of the frequently encountered anaerobic bacteria, there is a need for more simple methods in the routine clinical microbiology laboratory. Gradient strips are used as a simple but expensive method for AST. Disk diffusion on Wilkins-Chalgren agar (former CLSI recommended agar) for anaerobic bacteria has also been evaluated several years ago, and although results were promising at that time, the method has not been generally accepted. With the introduction of the EUCAST disk diffusion method the intention was to develop a standardised method for anaerobic bacteria. The following test conditions were suggested: the Brucella Blood Agar medium supplemented with hemin and vitamin K (BBA, currently recommended by the CLSI) with strictly controlled test conditions (temperature, atmosphere and time of incubation). The use of the disk diffusion method was limited to rapidly growing (<24 hours) anaerobic bacteria such as members of the Bacteroides fragilis group, Clostridium spp. and Fusobacterium necrophorum. Studies on BBA are in progress and preliminary studies with Bacteroides fragilis group and Fusobacterium necrophorum reference strains have been promising. Furthermore, studies with clinical isolates of Clostridium difficile shows that isolates with reduced susceptibility to metronidazole and vancomycin can be separated from wild-type isolates with disk diffusion. Clostridium perfringens or other Clostridium spp. may well be the next candidates to be evaluated for AST with disk diffusion. Although the reference methods are still the AST methods of choice for a large number of slow growing anaerobic species, disk diffusion seems to be a potential alternative for certain rapidly growing anaerobic bacteria.",

            "text": "Recent data indicate that there is a high percentage of isolates carrying a phage integrase gene. It is possible that they shape the genome at least in terms of the diversity of strains found worldwide as well as contribute to virulence evolution. Phylogenic analysis of the phage integrase gene showed a pattern of biogeographic separation. This is in agreement with a model of co-evolution between the virus and its bacterial host since biogeographic separation is also observed within H. pylori. A model of geographically constrained viral dispersal also fits, i.e. H. pylori from different geographical regions may have been infected by distinct phage lineages after the geographic separation of the bacterial host. Another hypothesis could be that after bacterial infection with the virus, the divergence of the bacterium is also accompanied by divergence of the integrated virus. It has been argued that H. acinonychis strain Sheeba is derived from H. pylori and that the prophage was acquired after the host jump from human to feline. An equally likely scenario is that the prophage was present in the bacterial genome before the host jump. There is ample evidence for continued exchange of genetic material between phages, bacterial genomes, and various other genetic elements. This explains the sometimes fuzzy distinction between phages, plasmids and pathogenicity islands (PAI), and the chimerical nature of some phage genomes. The origin of the cag PAI is currently unknown. An exciting hypothesis would be that cagPAI as well as newly described plasticity zones, which are being considered increasingly as true PAIs, have a phage origin.",

            "text": "Lund and O'Brien (2011) suggest that 15-20% of the population may be regarded as vulnerable to food borne infection. This is not a homogeneous group. Vulnerability is often considered in terms of increased likelihood of infection on exposure or increased risk of serious adverse outcome from infection but increased frequency or intensity of exposure should also be considered. Some vulnerable groups are clearly demarcated by physiological or pathological condition (pregnant women, HIV/AIDS etc). Therapies associated with increased risk include cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunomodulators (e.g. anti-TNF) and proton pump inhibitors. Infants and older people are also vulnerable although age boundaries between ''normal'' and increased risk are somewhat arbitrary. Poverty, poor education and lack of access to facilities for hygienic storage and preparation increase frequency and intensity of exposure. We can consider four categories of microbe (i) classical pathogens (e.g. salmonella) (ii) pathogens of at risk groups (e.g. L. monocytogenes) (iii) environmental organisms (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and (iv) cultures promoted as probiotic (Lactobacillus casei) Industrially prepared or catered foods should be free of classical pathogens. A challenging issue in relation to pathogens of at risk groups is the extent to which food-safety for vulnerable groups can be addressed by labelling/education as opposed to zerotolerance. Environmental species that occur in fresh fruit and vegetables are associated with infection in neutropaenic patients but avoiding these foods does not reduce infection. Foods containing ''probiotic'' cultures have been associated with infection but this is not common. Balancing the protection of vulnerable groups with public preferences for diverse and traditionally/minimally processed foods is a challenge. Also one needs to ensure that the quality of life of vulnerable people is not unduly impaired by loss of favourite foods and beverages. Freshly prepared thoroughly cooked food and freshly prepared washed fruit and vegetables are safe. Boiling water for 1 minute is a failsafe for immunecompromised patients; but reputable bottled waters or properly filtered/ treated waters and pasteurised bottled/packaged beverages are unlikely to cause problems. Animal products that have not had thermal treatment or equivalent should be avoided, likewise certain processed/catered foods that are at high risk for contamination with L. monocytogenes.",

Nosocomial outbreaks of listeriosis are relatively infrequent, but at least eight outbreaks were reported in England and Wales from 1999 to 2011. In Germany in Oct. 2007 , one public health office reported that two patients had stayed in the same hospital before the onset of listeriosis. Active case finding with retrospectively investigated listeriosis notifications from the state Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg was performed. All available isolates from 2006 to 2008 were characterized by PFGE. Altogether, 16 cases were identified, with 11 patients linked to hospital A (begin Dec. 2006); their nine available isolates were indistinguishable from an isolate of a food sample previously obtained during a routine inspection in food company A. This ready-to-eat cold cut sausage (used for Wurstsalat) was identified as source of the outbreak. Food items served in hospitals could be classified as ''food intended for special medical purposes''-as defined in the Commission Directive1999/21/EC. This would include the absence of L. monocytogenes in 25 g food. However, this special food is only considered for patients with severe neutropenia (<0.5 \u00b7 10^9/L, \u20216 days). In fact, none of the patients reviewed from hospital A met this criterion and consequently all of them had received regular food during their stay in hospital. In Oct. 2010 in Texas, company B had to recall all products shipped since Jan. (outbreakbegin). The 10 patients (five fatal) were shown to have recently eaten in hospital settings. Food and environmental samples were collected from the hospitals; the strain was found in chicken salad made with prepackaged, diced celery. Tracing the celery back led to company B. Cut celery was sold to restaurant and institutional settings, not grocery stores. In Austria (total population: 8.3 millions) on average one out of three citizens stays in a hospital each year (2 678 627 hospitaladmissions; mean 6.8 day; median: 3.9 day). Due to the prevailing high hygienic standards of hospital kitchens, ready-to-eat food remain a residual risk.

A vaccine to prevent disease is a feasible alternative approach, the development of which is a goal that appears achievable in the particular context of pregnancy-associated malaria. The evidence base for this assertion rests on several interconnected epidemiological, parasitological and immunological observations. At the epidemiological level it is known that, in areas with stable transmission of malaria, primigravid women are more susceptible than multigravidae, both to infection with P. falciparum and to its pathological consequences. The latter are directly related to the fact that parasite-infected erythrocytes (PfiE) accumulate in the placenta resulting, especially in primigravidae, in frequently intense monocytic inflammatory activity. Multigravidae are rendered less susceptible by the specific immunity they have acquired over the course of earlier pregnancies. That immunity is characterized by the antibody-based, gender-specific nature of the response to a particular parasite-derived protein antigen expressed on the surface of PfiE. The protein in question acts as a ligand that mediates adhesive interactions between PfiE and a placental receptor, chondroitin sulphate A (CSA), expressed on syncytiotrophoblasts. The antigen is referred to as VAR2CSA, a designation derived from the fact that it is encoded by a gene of the var family, members of which are responsible for the production of PfEMP1 proteins. Although indeed polymorphic, a characteristic of all PfEMP1 proteins, VAR2CSA displays a comparatively reduced degree of variability. The latter is emphasized by the fact that the antibodies acquired by multigravidae living in a given distinct geographical region can inhibit the adherence to CSA of infected erythrocytes from placentas of women living elsewhere. The detailed molecular understanding of the processes involved now available thus provides the foundation for the on-going efforts aimed at developing a VAR2CSA-based vaccine. Such a vaccine would represent an extremely valuable additional tool with which to reduce the burden of disease both in mothers and their offspring.",

The main impact of such chronic T. cruzi infection in pregnancy is the transmission of parasites to foetuses (occurring in 0.1% to 12% of infected pregnant women) and the development of a congenital Chagas disease. Detection of infection during pregnancy can be performed using serological tests. Serological testing is recommended for pregnant women who are living in disease endemic areas, or in disease non-endemic areas and are born or have lived previously in disease endemic areas or whose mothers were born in such areas. There is no way to identify, in advance, those infected mothers who will transmit the infection to their foetuses. Anti-parasitic treatment is not recommended during pregnancy and congenital infection cannot be prevented. There is presently an international consensus (WHO Technical Group on control of congenital Chagas disease) to recommend detection of congenital infection in newborns of infected mothers with treatment of positive neonates, as the best strategy for limiting short-term morbidity and mortality of acute congenital infection, and preventing long-term effects of Chagas disease. Detection of living parasites can be performed by microscopic examination of umbilical cord or neonate venous blood (microhematocrit test) or other parasitological tests (e.g. hemoculture). PCR assays can detect low amounts of T. cruzi DNA, but their standardization and validation are still under development. Detection of IgM and IgA antibodies and placental histopathology are not contributing to such diagnosis. In case of negative results close to birth, detection of specific antibodies using standard serological assays can be carried out 8-10 months after birth, i.e. when antibodies transferred from the mothers have been eliminated. A positive serological result at this time indicates that the infant is currently infected. Cases of congenital T. cruzi infection should be treated with benznidazol or nifurtimox as soon as the diagnosis has been confirmed. Treatment is generally successful and without the adverse reactions seen in adults if administered within the first year of life.",

But colistin is composed of at least 30 different polymyxin compounds, mainly colistin A and B, and it is administered intravenously or by nebulisation as a complex mix of colistin methanesulfonate (CMS) derivatives. Therefore it's pharmacokinetics is relatively complex and could not be investigated until specific analytical assay became available. Yet major studies have recently been conducted and colistin pharmacokinetics is nowadays mostly understood. It was demonstrated that in healthy volunteers, about 2/3 of the inactive CMS dose is lost by direct excretion in urine (1). Accordingly it was observed that in patients with relatively well preserved renal function and treated with the most usual maintenance dose (3 MIU/8), steadystate plasma concentrations of colistin could hardly reach values greater than 2 lg/mL (2). It was also observed that colistin concentrations are virtually constant between two consecutive administrations at steadystate with no real peak nor trough values. Furthermore colistin concentrations increase slowly after treatment initiation and it takes about 2 days before reaching steady-state suggesting the need for loading dose. These data were further confirmed in a study conducted on a greater number of critical care patients including some on hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement (3) . It was shown that CMS loading dose could be adjusted to body weight and maintenance dose to creatinine clearance (3) . However it was also concluded that colistin may best be used as part of a highly active combination, especially for patients with moderate to good renal function (creatinine clearance >70 mL/min) and/or for organisms with MICs of \u20211.0 lg/L (3).",

Colistin has been re-introduced into clinical practice for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria by necessity. Studies in the last decade have attempted to reconstruct the path present-day medications undergo prior to clinical use. The median half-life of active colistin is 9.1 hours in critically-ill patients with normal renal function. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies show that doses higher than those conventionally used in Europe are needed. Loading doses, amounting to the total daily dose, are recommended in critically-ill patients. Colistimethate sodium (produg) and colistin are efficiently removed by hemodialysis; daily doses of 6 million international units (MIU) are recommended for patients undergoing continuous hemofiltration and 1 MIU with intermittent hemodialysis. The cerebrospinalfluid (CSF)/serum ratio of colistin is 25% and intra-thecal doses >60 000 IU/day are needed to reach trough concentrations above 2 mg/ L in the CSF. Colistin was associated with lower mortality than no effective treatment and higher unadjusted mortality than beta-lactams in non-randomized comparative clinical studies. Two studies comparing colistin to inappropriate antibiotic treatment showed lower mortality with colistin, pooled odds ratio 0.51 (95% CI 0.24-1.08). Prospective studies or matched retrospective studies (N = 7) showed a pooled OR for death of 1.40 (95% confidence intervals 1.07-1.84), indicating significantly higher mortality with colistin. Four non-matched retrospective studies reported a pooled OR for death of 2.65 (95% CI 1. 76-3.99) . However, in all these studies colistin was administered to sicker patients with carabapenem-resistant bacteria. Overall, nephrotoxicity rates were not higher with colistin in studies comparing colistin to other antiobiotics and colistin-induced nephrotoxicity is reversible in most patients. Emergence of colistin resistance has been described in high use settings. Synergy with carbapenem, rifampin and other antibiotics has been reported in-vitro.

Large spectrum antibiotics are major risk factors for C. difficile infections (CDI) leading to intestinal dysbiosis and disruption of the microbiota barrier effect. Then, C. difficile multiplies and colonizes the intestinal tract. Molecular methods based on 16S rDNA and metagenomics have given new insights into the composition of the intestinal microbiota. Three major phyla compose the adult intestinal microbiota: Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes (Clostridium leptum-Clostridium coccoides) and Actinobacteria. Each human being has his own gut microbiota at the species level. Several species, however, are shared by at least 50% of healthy human population, and constitute a phylogenetic core. The bacterial composition of the human microbiota varies greatly according to age. Several studies have profiled the microbiota in infants, adults and the elderly colonized by C. difficile. The loss of colonization resistance against C. difficile was associated with qualitative and quantitative changes in the microbiota. In asymptomatic infants colonized by C. difficile and adults with CDI, species diversity in the intestinal microbiota was not affected by the presence of C. difficile. In contrast, microbiota of adults with recurrent CDI presented a significant biodiversity decrease. Patients with multiple recurrent CDI have marked reduction of Bacteroides, C. coccoides and C. leptum groups with increases of Enterobacteriaceae and Veillonella spp. In young healthy infants, C. difficile colonization was associated with changes in the intestinal microbiota ecosystem: Bifidobacterium longum was associated with faecal microbiota of C. difficile non-colonized infants, while colonized infants presented more frequently Ruminococcus gnavus and Klebsiella pneumoniae species. Microbiota of elderly patients with CDI was characterized by a reduced number of Bacteroides and bifidobacteria and by a greater diversity of facultative species, lactobacilli and clostridia. A bacterial signature associated with the absence of C. difficile colonization will provide information about bacterial groups involved in the barrier effect against C. difficile. These data pave the way to define therapeutic approaches for microbiota modulation with an anti-C. difficile objective.",

Infections emerging during bone marrow aplasia now became predominant causes of death, with the risk of severe infections directly corresponding to the duration of profound neutropenia. During the past decade, antineoplastic treatment strategies have elaborated which are based upon pathogenic molecular mechanisms, designated as ''targeted therapies'', ''small molecules'' or ''epigenetic strategies'', and in some instances, toxicities from conventional chemotherapy, including myelosuppression, have become less burdensome. One of the major advances in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemias and myelodysplastic, particularly in elderly patients, has been the introduction of demethylating agents such as 5azacytidine, providing a treatment modality aiming at DNA repair in malignant myeloid precursor cells instead of cytotoxic eradication associated with transient, but profound and critically long-lasting marrow aplasia. This remarkably effective approach has enabled antileukaemic therapy also in fragile and co-morbid patients formerly excluded from myelosuppressive treatment modalities. However, since the malignant clone is not eradicated, this treatment is indefinite and typically results in emerging resistance and clinical relapse. And although further non-myeloablative treatment modalities including histone deacetylase inhibitors or multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed also for leukaemia treatment in recent years, all these approaches will not substitute the classical myelablative chemotherapy in the treatment of acute leukaemias.",

It is also clear that the immune response to infection is generally excellent since only about 1% of the 1.7 billion infected people worldwide have active disease. However, in those patients with active infection, there is widespread inflammatory tissue destruction. This talk will focus on the role of the innate immune system in both host defence to and the pathology of tuberculosis. The principal innate inflammatory cells involved in host defence are phagocytic cells of the macrophage lineage including multi-nucleate giant cells but others including stromal cells, neutrophils and NK cells are of key importance. The innate immune response acting through a series of pattern recognition receptors orchestrates the host response by secreting a range of mediators, cytokines and chemokines. Innate immunity targets the pathogen by secretion of molecules such as cathelicidins and defensins. In addition, by upregulating gene expression and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase enzymes, it is critical to the destruction of host tissue. This is both the pre-requisite for the spread of infection and the hallmark of severe infection leading to morbidity and mortality. Innate immune function is influenced by the physiological and metabolic environment. In this talk, the diverse aspects of innate immunity will be discussed and the potential for the novel application of immune modulators to improve patient outcomes will be examined.",

Biocides are increasingly used in a number of applications and concern has been raised that biocide exposure might act as a selective force for development to biocide resistance and that such mutants may be cross resistant to antibiotics. Our laboratory has studied the consequences of exposure of bacteria to various biocides in terms of survival and development of antibiotic resistance. We have assessed exposure to in use concentrations of biocides and sub-optimal exposures and determined the ability of strains to survive and characterised surviving mutants using a combination of flow cytometry, phenotypic characterisation, transcriptomic and genomic analysis and virulence assays. We have found bacteria can survive high level biocide exposure and that surviving mutants demonstrate a low-level multiple antibiotic resistance phenotype and that this is mediated by de-repression of multidrug efflux. Similarly biocide exposure results in selection of multidrug efflux mutants. However the propensity to select for antibiotic resistant mutants varies between different biocides we have evaluated and true biocide resistance is rare and hard to achieve. Biocides must be used appropriately and in line with recommended dilutions to ensure success, the potential for development of antibiotic resistance should be considered when developing novel biocide formulations.",

To prevent of the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria appropriate disinfection and antisepsis is advised in corresponding guidelines. The question has been raised, whether repeated and continued use of biocidal substances can lead to the promotion of biocide resistance or even antibiotic resistance. In the assessment of available data on resistance it is crucial to use appropriate definitions. While antibiotic resistance is usually defined as a minimum inhibitory concentration above the level that is reached in affected human tissue, biocide resistance should be defined as a significantly increased biocidal concentration needed to pass accepted disinfectant test standards. Use of sublethal biocide concentrations can lead to phenotypic adaptation of microbes, which is different from resistance, which is hereditary. It can also select for unspecific resistance mechanisms, which confer cross resistance to antibiotics. This has not been observed, when biocides are used at microbicidal concentrations. In several studies clinical isolates from infected patients did not demonstrate any resistance to biocidal substances used in the same setting. While antibiotics target specific microbial structures or metabolic processes, biocides have broad and unspecific mechanisms of action and target sites. It is concluded that appropriate use of disinfectants and antiseptics in infection prevention using concentrations defined by tests according to accepted standards does not bear a relevant risk of the development of biocide resistance or promotion of antibiotic resistance.",

The bacteria can be characterized and compared by myriad phenotypic or genotypic methods; one may choose methods that are suitable for fine-focused local outbreak investigations or others that give panoramic perspectives of population structure. Against this background of resistant isolates, strains and clones, one must consider the complexity of genes, integrons, transposons and plasmids that confer resistance. These fundamental units of resistance spread through bacterial populations vertically, by association with successful strains or lineages, or horizontally between strains, species and genera. Applying an epidemiological aspect to these molecular investigations additionally requires us to factor in whether the resistant bacteria were isolated from humans (in hospital, nursing home, or community settings), animals (food production, companion or wild), foodstuffs, or environmental samples and should ideally include denominators, and demographic, temporal and geographic data. The depth of any investigation will ultimately depend on its goals and the resources available. The nature of multiresistance in Enterobacteriaceae is highly complex, involving spread or repeated selection of successful clonal lineages, and horizontal spread of resistance plasmids. Local investigations are useful for guiding infection control, but maximum information is obtained if they can be set into a national or international context.

This may be due to any of these reasons or their combinations: increased virulence (which is rarely proved), delayed appropriate therapy (because the probability of prescribing inappropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy is increased), and diminished efficacy or increased toxicity of available second-line drugs. In the case of Enterobacteriaceae, invasive infections caused by ESBL-producers have been shown to be associated with increased mortality; we may assume that the effect is similar for isolates producing other mechanisms of resistance. Infections caused by MDR-E occur more frequently in predisposed patients, as those with underlying diseases, admitted to healthcare centres or undergone invasive procedures, and who had recently received antimicrobial treatment, but may also happen increasingly in healthy patients with community-acquired infections. Thus, in front of patients with serious infections, clinicians frequently need to decide between the empirical use of very broad spectrum antimicrobials (and even second-line drugs) to cover MDR-E, or to reserve them in order to avoid further spread of resistance. Several clues may help in this decision making-process. First, pre-test probability may be estimated in base of local prevalence of antibiotic resistance. Second, evaluation of the individual risk factors for MDR-E may help to identify patients with lower or higher risk for infections caused by these organisms (post-test probability). And third, a careful assessment of the severity of acute disease and systemic inflammatory response syndrome would help to identify patients in which appropriate empirical therapy is an absolute priority. In the absence of randomised clinical trials, decisions for empirical therapy, de-escalation strategies, and use of alternative agents in different situations need to be based on a deep knowledge on the available microbiologic data, PK/PD models, and clinical studies. It follows that management of acute infections in the 21st century demands a certain degree of super-specialisation for performing an adequate and timely clinical work-up, correctly identifying the potential source of infection and severity, and the specific determinants that modify the potential risks, aetiologies and antimicrobial susceptibility, so that the decisions about antimicrobial therapy can be optimised.",

It appears to be an amide formed by condensation of marinolic acid that is similar to the anti-MRSA antibiotic mupirocin (also known as pseudomonic acid), except for possessing 8-hydroxyoctanoic acid instead of 9-hydroxynonanoic acid, and a pyrrothine similar to holomycin. To understand how these antibiotics are made and provide genetic information for constructing hybrid pathways we have analysed the thiomarinol biosynthetic genes and used this to underpin further analysis on both pathways. As with the mupirocin cluster the thiomarinol cluster encodes its own isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, the known target for mupirocin. Cloning these resistance genes from both the mup and the tml clusters in E coli showed that the TmlM protein confers complete resistance to thiomarinol but that the MupM only confers resistance to mupirocin. Targeted gene knockouts allowed the derivation of strains that produce the pyrrothine but no marinolic acid, marinolic acid but no pyrrothine or both of these components separately but with no production of thiomarinol. The mutant unable to produce marinolic acid was fed with mupirocin and was shown to produce a novel analogue of thiomarinol that was able to inhibit the growth of mupirocin-resistant MRSA. The tmlU gene is responsible for joining marinolic acid and pyrrothine together for production of thiomarinol but surprisingly when introduced into the mupirocin producer TmlU appears to interfere with the elongation of the 9 hydroxynonanoic acid component. We are also testing whether amide synthetases related to TmlU can substitute for it in this reaction, thus allowing a larger number of diverse substrates to be used. We are also manipulating the expression of genes of the mupirocin cluster in order to increase production but without accumulation of side products such as Pseudomonic acid B.",

We also isolated several antibiotics such as holomycin and indolmycin that are known antibiotics hithero only isolated from terrestrial Streptomycetes. The fact that we predominantly found already known antibiotics could be because we used the same growth conditions as many previous studies. Genome sequencing of one Pseudoalteromonas strain from which two antibiotics were isolated revealed that at least seven PKS/NRPS genes were found. Hence manipulating culture conditions, or expression in other hosts, may induce expression of hithero silent genes coding for bioactive metabolites. Certainly culturing one of the antibiotic producing Vibrionaceae on a substrate mimicking its natural conditions by containing exclusively chitin as C-and N-source, led to a dramatic alteration in secondary metabolite profile. Under these natural growth conditions, the antibiotic became almost the only metabolite produced. Some strains of the Vibrionaceae also produced compounds, so-called solonamides, that were not antibacterial per se but that specifically inhibited the quorum sensing system in Staphylococcus aureus likely via binding to the Agr. Also the quorum sensing system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited by a yet un-identified compound produced by Roseobacter clade strains. Whilst it is known that both Roseobacter clade bacteria and Pseudoalteromonas species produce bioactive compounds, the Vibrionaceae have predominantly been researched due to their role as pathogenic or symbiotic bacteria. Our work demonstrates that this bacterial group likely also harbours organisms of biotechnological interest. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of bacteria continue to provide considerable challenges for clinicians who face a deceasing arsenal of antibiotics, many of which are analogues of compounds for which resistance has already arisen. MDR strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, other Gram-positive pathogens such as S. aureus, Clostridium difficile and the intrinsically-resistant Gram-negative bacteria such as Salmonella enterica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa require the development of new classes of antibacterial which are 'opaque' to efflux, or alternative strategies to reduce the MDR phenotype, for example the use of efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs). Plants are an untapped source of antibacterial chemotypes and at present there are no examples of phytochemicals which are used clinically. This is unusual given the wide use of plant materials in traditional systems of medicine, which in many communities of the developing world are the only resource available for the treatment of topical or even systemic infections. We have been studying plants that are used medicinally for their antibacterial and resistance modifying properties and have isolated a number of compounds that display potential such as the garlic metabolite1 1 and the Hypericum2 natural product 2, which display MIC values of 0.1 and 2 mg/L against M. tuberculosis and S. aureus respectively. In collaboration we have also investigated the ability of plant-derived compounds such as the natural product three to inhibit multidrug efflux, having dual antibacterial and EPI activity. This lecture will cover the need for antibacterials and resistance-modifying agents and will propose plant natural products as a useful source of these molecules with examples from our work to date.

The development of efficient strategies for prevention and treatment of HCV infection has been hampered by rapid development of viral resistance and escape. Viral entry into target cells is a promising target for antiviral preventive and therapeutic strategies since it is essential for initiation, spread and maintenance of infection. Indeed, cross-neutralizing antibodies inhibiting HCV entry have been shown to be associated with control of HCV infection and prevention of HCV re-infection in cohorts with selflimited acute infection. HCV entry is a multistep process involving several host factors including heparan sulfate, CD81, scavenger receptor B1, claudin-1 and occludin. Using a functional genome-wide RNAi kinase screen we have recently identified a network of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) as HCV entry factors. Functional studies indicate that kinases act on postbinding steps by interfering with CD81-claudin-1 co-receptor associations and membrane fusion. Using an infectious cell culture model, we demonstrate that targeting of host entry factors by receptor-specific monoclonal antibodies or inhibition of RTKs by approved protein kinase inhibitors block entry and infection of all HCV genotypes including viral escape variants that are resistant to autologous host immune responses. These results suggest that targeting host entry factors using receptor-specific monoclonal antibodies or small molecules constitutes a novel antiviral approach to prevent primary HCV infection, such as after liver transplantation and may also restrain virus spread in chronically infected patients.",

            "text": "Assessing non responders Although community acquired pneumonia (CAP) diagnosis may be straightforward, the criteria commonly used, physical examination and chest radiography, have high sensibility but low specificity. Furthermore microbiological documentation may not be possible, especially in viral infections, and its results usually are not available before 48 hours of presentation. The evaluation of the response to antibiotics may be even more problematic, because it relies on the normalization of those unspecific criteria previously used. Non response has been mostly defined by subjective criteria, like clinical deterioration within 72 hours, lack of response or worsening of clinical or radiologic status, persisting fever or clinical symptoms (malaise, cough, expectoration, dyspnoea). The pattern of C-Reactive Protein kinetics in CAP, namely failure to decrease its concentration, has also been associated with non response. Non response to antibiotics may simply unveil a wrong diagnosis. However in the presence of true CAP different factors related to the host, the bacteria and the antibiotic itself may lead to therapeutic failure. Host, Bacteria, Antibiotic Host age and comorbid conditions, genetic polymorphisms, namely in the Toll Like Receptor-4 gene and Tumor Necrosis Factor and the bacteria causing health care related CAP, especially Pseudomonas, have been implicated in slow response to CAP, which may mimic non response. But the most common causes of antibiotic failure is bacteria resistance to antibiotics and the presence of suppurative complications such as empyema or abscess. Finally polymicrobial CAP, including viral and bacterial co-infection, is usually more severe and more often associated with therapeutic failure and mortality. No compliance to antibiotic therapy, especially in the outpatient setting, is another cause of non response and should always be excluded. Antibiotics may also fail to achieve adequate concentrations, especially in the lung tissue, as a consequence of pharmacokinetic changes in the host during sepsis. Moreover adequate infection control may require larger antibiotic exposure. Although antibiotic therapy is of utmost importance, especially in severe CAP, adequate antibiotic therapy alone, even if used optimally, probably is not sufficient to reduce the associated mortality. Therefore interest in non-antibiotic, adjunctive therapy has continued to grow. However until now no single drug has proven to be beneficial in patients with CAP.",

            "text": "Myocarditis is an inflammatory heart disease, usually caused by infectious agents. In Europe and North America the most common causes of myocarditis are viral agents. Patients with acute myocarditis present a range of symptomatology, from asymptomatic courses to severe manifestations leading to intensive care therapy. However, the diagnosis of myocarditis is based on histology, and thanks to endomyocardial biopsies it is possible to identify viral genomes by using molecular biology techniques (PCR, in situ hybridization). Moreover, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, that is the underlying cause in around 50% of patients with heart failure, has been associated with myocarditis, because the incidence of biopsy-diagnosed myocarditis in patients with unexplained congestive heart failure can reach two thirds of cases. For a long time, enteroviruses have been considered to be the most common cause of acute viral myocarditis, with possible transition from acute myocarditis to dilated cardiomyopathy. Recent investigations have shown, however, that other viruses are also frequently encountered in acute myocarditis patients, suggesting that persistence of various virus species may play a pathogenic role in the transition from acute myocarditis to dilated cardiomyopathy. Thanks to a most extended use of endomyocardial biopsy in the diagnosis of myocarditis, new viral agents and new mechanisms of damage have been detected. Enterovirus, parvovirus B19, Cytomegalovirus, HHV6, and EB virus genomes have been identified in myocarditis, and mechanism of damage has been characterized. For example. during an acute myocarditis caused by enterovirus several mechanisms of myocyte damage can actually be recognized including: (i) the induction of an inflammatory reaction to the infectious agent; (ii) the release of destructive proteases from the host; and (iii) the activation of intracellular apoptotic pathways. The complex processes determined by viral infection will change the entire heart anatomical and functional structure, leading to activation of an adaptive mechanism known as heart remodeling, which involves heart dilation and ventricular dysfunction in patients with congestive heart failure. S108 Therapeutic approach to infectious myocarditis Myocarditis is defined as inflammation of the heart. This is induced either by any inflammatory process, or directly by infection. Among therapeutic means, we can distinguish non specific and specific goals. MR-scan could help greatly to diagnose quickly acute myocarditis and could help to chose appropriate treatments. Nevertheless, it could not assess particular infection. EMB remains gold-standard, even if scarcely performed. Specific treatments are recommended only for proved cardiac infection, that is theorically in case of positive endomyocardialbiopsy (EMB). Among numerous infectious agents, specific treatment is then available: bacterial infections (in case of severe sepsis, Lyme, tuberculosis, \u2026), parasitic (Chagas disease, toxoplasmosis,\u2026) and mainly in case of viral infections: coxsackiesviruses, CMV, EBV, HIV\u2026 Immunomodulation could endly offer new possibilities of treatments: cytokine modulation could help to redirect wrong immunological answer. Interferon could help in several situations, illustrating importance of immunomodulation. New medical hypotheses are actually explored, such as arrhythmias, and possibly specific actions of non specific treatments, or even interest of cardiac frequency. Non specific treatments aim at improving cardiac physiology: CEI, ARB, beta-blockers. In case of severe left ventricular dysfunction, spironolactone is also possible. Diuretics are often necessary for symptom relief. These treatments are probably also involved in other therapeutic ways, especially through anti-inflammatory effects (CEI or ARB mainly). In a recent French registry beta-blockers seemed to lower mortality. Anti-inflammatory treatments, such as aspirin or colchicine, are often proposed to decrease systemic and cardiac inflammation, but this point remains controversial. Methods: CHIF-NET is the first nationwide invasive fungal infection surveillance study in China that covered 12 tertiary hospitals in nine provinces. It is important to note that, only yeasts that isolated from blood or other sterile body sites were collected. All isolates were identified by amplification and sequencing of the internal transcribed (ITS) region.

An universal goal is to start appropriate treatment as soon as possible. It is logical that these facts are also valid in patients with invasive fungal infections (IFI). The problem is that IFI are often not easily recognisable and that we can only suspect them in patients at risk. While prospective, randomized studies are lacking, retrospective studies used different criteria of timing, although majority defined time as a period between culture sampling and start of appropriate treatment. Despite this, results uniformly showed that delay is associated with poorer outcome. In patients with candidemia, the importance of timing was assessed analyzing the time period between the time when positive blood cultures were drawn and start of AFT. Delay in treatment \u202112 or \u202124 hours increased hospital mortality 1.5-2.06 fold. Negative impact of delayed diagnosis and consequent AFT was shown in patients with candidemia: a 24-delay in blood culture positivity would almost double the risk of patients' death. Studies in hematological patients with invasive aspergillosis or zygomycosis showed that delay of appropriate antifungal therapy (AFT) for more than 10 or 6 days after the appearance of first symptoms almost doubled the mortality rates. The negative impact of treatment delay on patients' outcome urges physicians to start AFT empirically at high-risk patients with clinically suspected IFI (empirical therapy) or after positive new diagnostic tests associated with imaging findings (pre-emptive therapy, mostly for moulds infections). To avoid overtreatment with new, expensive antifungals, rapid diagnostic tests are necessary. Background: Renal transplant recipients are at increased risk for developing invasive pneumococcal diseases, but may have a poor response to the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV). The aim of this study was to compare antibody response of a sequential vaccination schedule of PPV with those of a sequential schedule of 7valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPnC) followed by PPV twelve months later in adult renal transplant recipients. Methods: We conducted a randomized doubleblind controlled study to evaluate the quantitative serological responses to pneumococcal serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F, 1, 5, and 7F. Using isotypespecific ELISA, two-fold antibody response compared to baseline was determined 8 weeks after the first vaccination, before the second vaccination, and 8 weeks after the second vaccination, respectively.

Vaccine effectiveness for PCV13 was based on data for PCV7 in children adjusted for age and risk profile, assuming similar levels of effectiveness against the additional six serotypes. PPSV23 effectiveness was based on an analysis by the Health Protection Agency. The analysis uses a UK NHS payer perspective, therefore only direct costs and outcomes were included. Health outcomes were measured in terms of quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Cost and outcomes were discounted at a 3.5% annual rate. Assumptions and parameter uncertainty were tested in sensitivity analyses. Results: It is estimated that adult vaccination with PCV13 instead of PPSV23 is cost-effective at the current NHS list price. Despite uncertainty around individual parameters, sensitivity analyses suggest that results were robust and PCV13 adult vaccination would be costeffective due to the high risk of pneumococcal infection among these groups.",

Objectives: Pertussis (PT) incidence has steadily increased in the United States since the 1980s. Mortality is the highest in children 3 months of age or younger. Incidence of PT quadrupled from 2000 to 2005 and was highest among those younger than 6 months. Because the first PT vaccine is recommended for administration in children at 2 months of age in the US, vaccination of persons caring for or exposed to infants is recommended to decrease transmission and thereby incidence of PT in this at-risk age group. At our rural hospital, opportunities are available to address the vaccination status of patients and a mechanism for administering pneumococcal and influenza vaccines is available. However, no assessment tool or mechanism was available for the nurses to determine appropriateness and administer PT vaccine without a physician order. To increase compliance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations, a tool was developed for nurses to assess a patient's eligibility for PT vaccination and to order vaccine. After education sessions, the tool was implemented for the maternity ward in July 2011. The overall objective of this study was to examine the impact of the tool on the rate of vaccination for PT among post-partum women.",

Oral fluid swabs were collected at ca.1 month intervals from subjects following administration of DTaP primary or pre-school booster (PSB). For the post-primary analysis, swabs were taken up to 280 days following the third dose as well as on the date of the third dose and for the PSB analysis shortly after the dose then at intervals up to ca. 380 days after. Total IgG was also measured because this may impact the assay with potentially lower aU titres when total IgG is low (<1 mg/ mL). Results: Results were available for 72 infants post-primary vaccination who had 1-9 samples taken with valid titres (515 results). Results were also available for a total of 121 post-PSB results with 5-13 samples with valid titres (1253 results). The decline in titre was modelled by taking log [10] (titre) and performing regression analysis of this against time. For the primary post-third dose the relationship showed reduction of 54% for each doubling of time. For post-PSB titres reached were higher and reduction slower at 34% per doubling of time. Assuming prevalence of 0.3, post-primary data showed high (95%) PPV by 282 days post-vaccination post-PSB data showed PPV of 86% at 1000 days (at the threshold). Evidence of reduced titres was found only when total IgG was very low (<0.5 mg/mL). Conclusions: Modelling post-vaccination titres allowed calculation of the PPV of the assay and correction for low total IgG. By estimating prevalence, the interpretation of post-vaccination titres can be expressed with PPVs. Further work to determine the distribution of titres above the threshold will assist the interpretation of these results. Objectives: Group B streptococcal (GBS) infection is the leading cause of bacterial infections during pregnancy and newborn mortality. The existence of ten capsular serotypes among GBS strains has produced challenges in development of an effective polysaccharide vaccine.

The study was supported by RFBR grant 10-04-00750a. , all proven cases, mostly within two months after diagnosis (n = 10, 59%). Twelve of these (71%) had preexisting risk factors for chronic Q fever. Only in five patients (29%) an episode of acute Q fever was diagnosed. Four deceased patients (24%) had endocarditis, 12 (71%) had vascular infection, and one patient (6%) had an unknown infection focus. These data show that mortality is 9% overall and 20% in proven cases. In proven cases, mortality of vascular Q fever infection is 24%, compared to 17% mortality for endocarditis, although this difference was not significant (p = 0.76). Conclusion: In the Netherlands, in contrast to reports from other countries, chronic Q fever manifests mainly as vascular infection, rather than endocarditis. Mortality of chronic Q fever is high: 9% overall and 20% in proven cases, which warrants awareness by clinicians. As an acute Q fever episode was diagnosed in only 29% of fatal proven chronic Q fever cases, screening programmes in high risk groups seem to be justified. Objectives: Early intervention including timely antibiotics in patients with severe sepsis on admission to hospital improves survival, but less is known about patients who develop sepsis in hospital and the potential to improve their care. The aim of this study was to develop and implement an intervention to improve care for these patients in an acute NHS hospital. Methods: Patients developing sepsis were identified prospectively by screening patients who had blood cultures taken in medical, surgical and orthopaedic wards. The primary study outcome measure was the proportion of septic patients that received antibiotics within four hours of sepsis onset. Baseline data were collected from Sept 08-Feb 09 and post-intervention from Oct 09-Mar 10. The design of the intervention was informed by the baseline clinical data and the findings of a questionnaire and interview survey of junior medical staff. A multifaceted intervention consisting of education, a care pathway, and audit and feedback was developed. The effect was evaluated by segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series (ITS) data. Results: Among the 241 baseline patients, only 91 (38%, 95%CI 32-44%) received antibiotics within 4 hours. The mean and median times to administration were 11.0 hours (95%CI 9.3-12.7 hours) and 6.0 hours (IQR 2.5-13.3 hours) respectively. Problems identified in the clinical data, and in the findings of 147 questionnaires (35% response rate) and ten interviews with junior doctors, included delays in the recognition of sepsis and in clinical decision-making. Post-intervention, 139/297 (47%, 95%CI 41-52%) patients met the primary outcome measure of antibiotics within 4 hours of sepsis onset and the 9% increase from baseline was statistically significant (X2 test p = 0.04). Run charts of the data pre-and post-intervention ( Figure) suggested a chaotic process and formal run chart analysis indicated nonrandom variation. Segmented regression analysis of ITS data did not show a statistically significant intervention effect (p value for change in level = 0.91, and for change in slope = 0.21).",

Adequate initial antibiotic treatment will minimise treatment failure and prevent associated increases in resource consumption. Objectives: It is important to detect the etiologic agent by the rapid diagnostic tests with high sensitive and specificity rates. Etiologic results may be learnt in less than hours with the new molecular diagnostic tests, therefore a proper antimicrobial therapy for the pneumonia can be managed early. This early targeted therapy can avoid the adverse reactions and the increased resistance profile of unnecessary antimicrobials and decrease the total cost. In this study it was aimed to evaluate the bacterial and viral etiology of CAP with polymerase chain reaction. Results: The rate of the specific agent detection with either conventional methods or PCR in the patients with community acquired pneumonia was 100%. S. pneumoniae was the most common agent (78%) similar with previous studies (Table 1) . Fifty four percent of the patients had more than one pathogen with mostly H. influenzae and rhinovirus. The viral agents which have increasing popularity in the last years were detected with a high ratio (36%) in our study (Table 2 ). They were detected as single agent in two patients and as concomitant agent in 16 patients. Unexpectedly, the most common viral agent was Rhinovirus. Coronavirus and Human Metapneumovirus were detected in one patient each.",

These are the first data related to newly discovered viruses such as Human Metapneumovirus, coronavir\u00fcs 229E/OC43, Bocavirus in Turkey. In addition these data suggest that mix infections are more common than they are expected in CAP requiring hospitalization. We suggest the usage of the molecular diagnostic tests in lower respiratory tract infections. The human bocavirus was initially discovered in 2005 as the second pathogenic member of the parvovirus family, next to the human parvovirus B19. HBoV has since been shown to be extremely common worldwide and -to cause a systemic infection in children and adults often resulting in respiratory or gastrointestinal disease. Parvoviruses are assumed to replicate via their genomic terminal hairpin-like structures in a so-called rolling-hairpin model, resulting in head-to-head or tail-to-tail intermediates. Surprisingly, in case of HBoV-1, we identified head-to-tail intermediates in clinical samples that are not compatible with the rolling hairpin model but are a typical feature of the classical rolling circle replication. A further study by Kapoor and co-workers (2011) confirmed our observation and extended the conclusion as those head-to-tail structures may originate from episomal genomes that persist in the infected host cell.",

            "text": "In concert with a clinical case recently described by our group, the hypothesis of episomal persistence following rolling circle replication seems a likely explanation. In the described case a child suffering from an autoimmune disease unable to produce an antibody response was infected with HHV6 and coinfected by HBoV. The HBoV shedding was discontinued after cidofovir therapy that successfully suppressed HHV6 titres to levels below the detection limit. The simultaneous disappearance of HBoV and HHV6 may be interpreted as a dependency of HBoV DNA replication on the presence of a herpesviral replication machinery, that in turn is able to initiate rolling circle replication in cis and in trans. Moreover the underlying autoimmune disease gives raise to the hypothesis that the HBoV infection was limited directly or indirectly by the cidofovir treatment rather than by a reconstituted immune response previously shut down by the HHV6 infection. Moreover it appears that HBoV contributes to chronic lung diseases as we observed an association of HBoV with lung fibrosis in several cases, as identified by the Luminex RVP assay. Thereby it remains unclear to which extent the clinical course was aggravated by HBoV or caused by HBoV persistence in turn inducing chronic inflammation resulting in fibrosis. Thereby, one patient suffered from a co-infection with CMV, another herpesvirus potentially acting as a helpervirus and thus supporting the hypothesis that HBoV may alternatively replicate in a rolling circle mechamism supported by helper viruses. Objectives: Paediatric liver transplant (LTx) patients (pts) are at particular risk of developing EBV -related posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD). The risk of PTLD is higher in pts with high viremia. However, among transplant recipients is a group of pts with chronically high viral load (CHVL) who do not develop lymphoproliferations, so there is a need for new prognostic markers to define pts at risk of serious complications. Polymorphism within cytokine genes, might contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. IL-12 plays a key role in anti-viral immune response. The A-to-C substitution within IL12B gene (SNP rs321227) affects the IL-12p40 production. The aim of the study was to analyse the polymorphism of IL-12p40 with regard to CHVL carriage in paediatric pts after LTx. Methods: One hundred seventy nine children after LTx were included in the study (median age at LTx 1.3 years, range 0.1-18). All pts were followed up for at least 12 months after LTx (median 30, range12-139). A group of 38 pts with CHVL (i.e. the presence of EBV DNA level >4000 copies/lg DNA in >60% of blood samples for min. 6 months) was selected. The remaining 141 pts with moderate or undetectable viremia consisted a control group. IL12B was genotyped by RFLP-PCR. The association between IL12B genotype and CHVL was analysed by multivariate logistic regression adjusting for confounders. To analyse the impact of IL12B polymorphisms on the length of CHVL carriage (defined as the time between 1st EBV DNA level >4000 copies and first two consecutive values below this level), the proportion of pts with persistent high viremia over 24-months period was assessed for each genotype. The Kaplan-Meier curves were compared using the log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards model was adjusted for tacrolimus level.",

Polymorphism within cytokine genes may influence the susceptibility and the clinical course of infectious diseases. The immunogenetic factors influencing outcome of CMV infection in paediatric liver transplant recipients (LTx) have been little investigated. The aim of this study was to assess the polymorphisms in selected cytokine genes that my impact on CMV reactivation in children after LTx. Methods: One hundred twenty-six paediatric pts after LTx (median age at LTx 1.3 years, range 0.1-18.0) were included in this study. All pts were CMV seropositive prior to LTx and 105/126 pts received graft from a positive donor (in 21 pts -donor was negative). All children were followed up for at least 12 months after LTx (median 29, range 12-111 months).

Control samples were collected from 14 adult patients who died accidentally or by committed suicide. Viral genomes (RNA/DNA) were detected and semi-quantified using broadrange PCR amplification assays coupled to electrospray ionization/ time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis (PCR/ESI-TOF MS) and by classical quantitative real-time PCR (Q rt-PCR) assays. Results: Sixteen (67%) of the 24 DCM patients were positive for single or multiple viral genome detection (HHV6 = 1 (4%); Human Enterovirus (EV) = four (17%); PVB19 = five (21%); EV-PVB19 = six (25%)) and correlating well with EV and PVB19 detection by classical Q rt-PCR assays (kappa tests = 0.69 [0.44-0.92 Objectives: Dengue is an arthropod-borne flavivirus with worldwide distribution. Persistent infection has been described in other flaviviruses such as West Nile virus (WNV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Our group has recently reported live dengue virus persistence in urine during convalescence. Here we demonstrate that viral persistence is not only prolonged, but also ''differential'' in body compartments. Methods: Specimens from eleven adult patients with acute DEN2 infection by standard ELISA and serotype-specific reverse transcription PCR were included in this study. Viral RNA extracted from plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), saliva and urine during febrile and convalescent periods was subjected to dengue-specific SYBR Green real time quantitative RT-PCR. Serial dilution of known concentration of DENV-2 (PFU/mL) was constructed as standard curve to determine the amount of viral shedding in each sample. Viral load of each sample was compared in the unit of PFU/microgram RNA. Results: All patients were secondary dengue infection. Ten were DHF (DHF I = 4, DHF II = 6) and the other was DF. Dengue virus was detected in both febrile and convalescent periods in nine of 11 patients. The viral RNA was detected in plasma (n = 9), PBMCs (n = 11), saliva (n = 8) and urine (n = 8) during febrile period and in plasma (n = 2), PBMCs (n = 1) and urine (n = 8) during convalescence. The viral loads shifted among samples and time points of infection. During the febrile period, viral loads in blood sample (plasma or PBMCs) were higher than those in saliva and in urine as well as those in convalescent samples. Interestingly, the viral loads in urine during late febrile phase were higher than those in the blood samples. Moreover in some patients, the viral loads in convalescent urine were higher than those in all corresponding febrile samples. Objective: Virus-mediated cell-to-cell fusion is a hallmark cytopathic effect accompanying infection by several enveloped viruses. While virus-to-cell fusion during entry has been extensively studied, little is known about cellular pathways involved in the process of cell-to-cell fusion. The non-enveloped reovirus fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins are the smallest known membrane fusion proteins. Unlike enveloped virus fusogens, FAST proteins are non-structural and are not involved in virus entry. Their sole function is to induce syncytium formation following infection, making them an ideal model for the study of cellular pathways involved in syncytiogenesis. In this study, we conducted a comparative, temporal analysis of FAST protein-and influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-mediated cell-to-cell fusion in order to determine whether viral proteins designed for entry and those designed for cell-to-cell fusion elicit a similar response during fusion pore expansion and syncytium formation. Methods: HA and p14-FAST were transfected and HA fusion was triggered by trypsinization and incubation of cells at pH4.8. Pore formation was monitored by transfer of a cytoplasmic fluor between quail fibroblasts and Vero epithelial cells. Syncytium formation, quantified by counting syncytial nuclei, indicated pore expansion. In addition, we developed a novel method to analyze pore expansion by adding the membrane curvature agent lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) during our temporal analysis of syncytium formation. Results: We report that while LPC does not inhibit FAST protein mediated pore formation, it does inhibit pore expansion resulting in a reversible ''stalled pore'' phenotype. In contrast, LPC inhibits both HAmediated pore formation and pore expansion, this ''stalled pore'' phenotype is also reversible. This is the first example of syncytium development arrest following a membrane fusion event.",

Using this system, we identified several cellular proteins involved in syncytium formation, which are currently under investigation in our laboratory. Objectives: Noroviruses are estimated to cause 80-95% of all gastroenteritis cases worldwide, representing a considerable public health burden. The genotype GII.4 lineage is predominant in healthcare settings. The nucleotide sequence of the capsid P2 domain has been used to discriminate outbreaks. The aim of this study was to use whole genome sequencing to provide detail to elucidate transmission events within outbreaks. Methods: Nineteen complete norovirus genomes were determined by Sanger sequencing. These represented five separate outbreaks and two unlinked individuals, submitting samples between Jan 2010 and June 2011. Detailed corresponding epidemiological data was collected. The BEAST (Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees) package was used to reconstruct relationships and determine the rate of evolution within the defined timeframe. Results: The 19 complete GII.4 genomes (7560 nucleotides (nt) with 569 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) were included in our analysis. The rate of evolution was estimated at 5 \u00b7 10-3 mutations per site per year (~3 mutations/genome/month), comparable with recent reports of rates between 4.3-9.0 \u00b7 0-3 mutations per site per year, calculated using Bayesian analysis of the GII.4 capsid (1623 nt) and polymerase (247 nt) fragments of the genome. Isolates within four of five outbreak clusters were identical according to the capsid P2 domain (455 nt) sequence alone. However, all but four isolates had one or more SNPs by whole genome sequencing (WGS)(see figure) . WGS confirmed one cluster of 5 isolates containing four identical isolates and the fifth containing only two SNPs. In the four clusters each containing identical P2 domains, WGS revealed 2, 10, 13 and 24 SNPs within each cluster suggesting that these were part of larger ongoing outbreaks.",

No less concerning, chronic respiratory infection by P. aeruginosa is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) and a frequent complication of other respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or bronchiectasis. Due to a complex multifactorial adaptive process, once established, P. aeruginosa chronic infections are almost impossible to eradicate with antibiotics. The underlying factors driving this situation include (i) the transition from the planktonic to the biofilm mode of growth, associated with a significant reduction of antimicrobial susceptibility, (ii) the extraordinary capacity of P. aeruginosa for acquiring resistance to nearly all available antibiotics through a complex interplay of intrinsic and mutation-driven resistance pathways, (iii) the intense genetic adaptation and phenotypic diversification process taking place within the CF lung and (iv) the frequent emergence and fixation of mutator phenotypes, often resulting from a nonfunctional DNA mismatch repair system caused by the inactivation of mutS or mutL genes leading to increased (up to 1000-fold) spontaneous mutation rates. Moreover, results from recent research argue that the four factors are intimately interconnected and act synergistically to establish life-long persistent infections that are highly recalcitrant to the activity of antimicrobial agents: the biofilm mode of growth is found to facilitate development of mutation-driven resistance, selection of mutators, genetic adaptation and phenotypic diversification; conversely, mutator phenotypes are shown to significantly enhance mutation-driven resistance, biofilm development, genetic adaptation and phenotypic diversification.",

            "text": "The growing number of immunocompromised patients could account for the increased number of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) detected. However, the use of corticosteroids, intravascular devices, and other aggressive procedures may also be responsible for the increase in the number and different types of patients at risk of developing IFIs. An accurate study of the epidemiology of IFIs requires reliable diagnostic tools, yet our knowledge of epidemiology in IFIs is limited by the difficulty in establishing a diagnosis. Invasive candidiasis is the most common IFI and is particularly prevalent in patients carrying intravascular catheters, those undergoing abdominal surgery, and very-low-birth-weight newborns. Although Candida albicans is still the main etiologic agent in invasive candidiasis, other non-albicans Candida species are becoming increasingly prevalent. Knowledge of local epidemiology is important, as susceptibility to antifungal agents is mainly based on the species involved, which vary with geography. Furthermore, widespread use of antifungal agents is also contributing to antifungal resistance. Invasive aspergillosis and other mold infections have classically affected patients with hematological cancer in periods of deep and prolonged neutropenia and recipients of solid organ or bone marrow transplant. Today, the population at risk of acquiring mold infections is more heterogeneous and includes patients with chronic lung diseases receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy. Environmental factors may also contribute to invasive aspergillosis in patients with a relatively sound immune status, such as those undergoing major surgery. Invasive aspergillosis is caused mainly by Aspergillus fumigatus; however, recent advances in fungal taxonomy have uncovered a more complex species epidemiology. Finally, the increasing number of azole-resistant A. fumigatus isolates is making patient management difficult. Although restricted to the north of Europe, this problem has the potential to spread to other areas. My presentation reviews and updates current knowledge on the epidemiology of IFIs, with emphasis on populations at risk, causative agents, and problems related to antifungal resistance. There was no statistically significant difference in LTBI frequencies among the three groups (p = 0 773). Conclusion: Although HCWs and HIV infected patients are considered as having an increased risk of LTBI compared to population at large, our results showed that LTBI prevalence was similar among the three groups. According to the WHO, one-third of the world's population has LTBI, being at risk of developing disease. A much lower prevalence of LTBI was found in our study. One possible reason for these observations is the fact that WHO data is based on the Mantoux test, which is affected by prior BCG vaccination, providing lower specificity and false-positive results. Objectives: Pott's disease (PD) has reemerged in some European countries due to immigration. In the last 15 years Catalonia has increased from 6 to 7.5 million citizens, in 84% due to foreign people. The aim of this study was to review our series of PD, focusing on cases associated to immigration. Methods: A retrospective review of all consecutive episodes diagnosed at a university hospital, from 1993 to 2010. All patients had TB confirmed by bacteriologic and/or histological studies. We recorded socio-demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, clinical features, microbiological and histopathologic studies, treatment and outcome. Results: During the study period 45 episodes (21 men, median age 56 years) of PD were diagnosed. In the last 10 years percentage of immigrants from undeveloped countries increased (37% vs. 5%, p = 0.016). The most common underlying conditions were: alcoholism in 5, diabetes in 4, HIV in 3, liver transplant in 3, systemic steroids therapy in 2 and chronic renal failure in 2. Median duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 4 months (IQR 1-7). Clinical presentations were pain (88%), neurologic manifestations (49%), constitutional symptoms (27%) and fever (18%). Extraspinal involvement was diagnosed in 10 (22%) patients among which 50% had pulmonary TB. The main spinal sites of involvement were lumbarsacral in 18 (40%), thoracic in 16 (36%), thoraco-lumbar in five (11%) and multifocal in two (4%). M. tuberculosis was isolated in 30/38 (79%) vertebral specimens studied and 20/40 (50%) patients had suggestive histology. Complications included paravertebral abscess/ mass in 62%, medullar compression in 31% and spinal deformity in 24%. Median duration of antituberculous chemotherapy was 12 months. Surgical treatment was performed in 12 (27%) patients. Infection was cured in all cases, except for 2 TB-related deaths due to disseminated disease. At the end of follow up (median: 18 months) none of the cases relapsed and 19 (42%) patients had persistent sequelae. Compared to natives, immigrants were younger (34 vs. 57 years, p = 0.002) and required more often surgery (64% vs. 16%, p = 0.002), due to a higher proportion of paravertebral abscess (91% vs. 58%, p = 0.047) and medullar compression (70% vs. 26% p = 0.01).",

            "text": "Conclusions: In our setting the proportion of PD cases occurring in immigrants is increasing. Compared to natives, foreign born are younger and more frequently require surgery due to higher proportion of complications. Paradoxical aggravation is a well described outcome of treated tuberculosis also identified as the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in HIV patients receiving HAART. Some cases have also been notified after biotherapy withdrawal. Objectives: We report the first case-series of anti-TNF induced TB-IRIS and compared them with non-IRIS TB patients in order to determine prevalence and IRIS risk factors. Methods: Anti-TNF associated TB-IRIS cases were collected from the French register RATIO (69 reported cases of anti-TNF associated TB) and national case-calls, 28 anti-TNF associated TB without IRIS during the 6 months following TB diagnosis were collected as controls and randomly matched two for one according to the year of TB diagnosis. Conditional logistic regression was done by using SAS software. Results: Between 2001 and 2010, 14 cases of anti-TNF associated TB-IRIS were collected. Patients were median 52 years-old, underlying inflammatory diseases were inflammatory arthritis (10), vasculitides (3) and psoriasis (1) lasting for a median of 9 years. Anti TNF-alpha drug was monoclonal antibodies (13) and soluble receptor (1) prescribed for a median of 37 weeks. TB presentation was mostly disseminated (12). Anti-TNF was stopped. As anti-TB antibiotics started, eight patients received steroids. After initial improvement, IRIS occurred in a median of 62 days after antituberculous therapy beginning, manifestations were fever, lymph node swelling, tuberculoma, cold abscesses, pleural, pericardial or abdominal effusion, pulmonary cavitation, or increased pulmonary lesions. All recovered but required increase of steroids dose (9), rituximab initiation (1), new antituberculous treatment (3) or surgery (3). Among RATIO cohort, IRIS prevalence was 7.14%. Case-control study identified disseminated tuberculosis (OR = 5.56, p = 0.03), strong immunodepression (OR = 4.59, p = 0.02) as IRIS risk factors. TB-IRIS was associated to a significantly longer antituberculous treatment 16 months vs. 8 months (OR = 1.45, p = 0.046).",

Conclusion: The patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were mainly impaired in cellular immunity, humoral immune damage also play a role. The patients with pulmonary tuberculosis complicated by COPD were impaired both in cellular immunity and in humoral immunity, and its extent of immune impairment is more serious than that of the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Objectives: There is a lack of point-of-care (POC) diagnostics in tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis. Measurement of IP-10 released by whole blood stimulation with TB specific antigens has recently been proposed as a new tool for the diagnosis of latent (and active) TB with diagnostic accuracy at-par with the Quantiferon TB in tube-assay (QFT, Cellestis). Higher cytokine release of IP-10 in comparison to interferon-gamma (IFN-g) could permit measurement of IP-10 in a POC test. The aim of this study was to compare a new lateral flow based POC IP-10 detection device head-to-head with the QFT in patients with active TB and healthy controls.",

The cut-off points for positive test were determined to be 0.56 ng/mL, 0.32 ng/mL, and 5.0 ng/mL for LFI, MPA, and ELISA, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of IP-10 measurement were 83% and 83% (LFI), 83% and 93% (MPA), and 72% and 96% (ELISA), respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for QFT was 69% and 100% using the manufacturer's cut off of 0.35 IU/mL.

Conclusion: In our study the POC LFI measuring IP-10 had comparable sensitivity and specificity compared to QFT for the diagnosis of active TB. The three test methods to measure IP-10 after stimulation with TB-specific antigens correlated well to each other and to QFT. Prospective studies evaluating this new IP-10-POC test are thus warranted. The sensor is able to discriminate the signature of a causative organism using pattern recognition software. Studies have shown that they may be valuable in detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis directly from patient sputa. We proposed a study evaluating the use of such a sensor for the detection of M. tb directly from the breaths of patients suspected of having pulmonary TB. Method: The objective was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the sensor (NextDimension Technology, California) to that of TB microscopy, and culture or GeneXpert. TB suspects were recruited at PHC facilities in the Paarl area, Western Cape. Forty smear positive, culture/Xpert positives, 28 smear negative, culture/Xpert positive, and 48 smear negative, culture/Xpert negative TB suspects were recruited over a 6 month period (September 2010-February 2011). In addition, breath samples from 50 healthy volunteers were obtained. Thirty-nine percent of the study population was HIV-positive. The test, performed in triplicate, consisted of a patient exhaling into a bag, which was then attached to the sensor and the sample was analysed in real-time.",

After a median follow-up of 3.8 years (2562 patient-years) for the whole cohort and 4.2 years (1537 patient-years) for patients at risk (on anti-TNF therapy), four (0.6%) patients developed TB (incidence: 156 per 100 000 patients/years; 95%CI 50-377 for the whole cohort, and 195; 95%CI 50-531 for patients at risk). Three out of four cases occurred in patients on anti-TNF therapy, one in each period. Another patient had negative TST and QFT, and did not receive neither Pre-tx nor anti-TNF therapy. Conclusion: Systematic evaluation and treatment of patients prior TNF-antagonist therapy, prevents TB in a great extent. Ceasing the twostep TST practice and introducing QFT substantially reduce diagnoses and pre-emptive treatments for LTBI without increasing the risk of TB.

In the 6th months after treatment of Linezolid, 10 patients presented cavity closure. Sputum smear negative conversion occurred in all pulmonary cases at a median of 64 days(range:8-210).Culture conversion occurred in all pulmonary cases at a median of 63 days(range:8-210).The relapse of both sputum and imaging occurred in two cases after 4 months of not using Linezolid. Six cases presented nausea, vomiting and other gastrointestinal reactions, but symptoms disappeared after reduction of Linezolid. Three patients developed peripheral neuropathy. Two patients developed declining of eyesight. Six cases had hematological adverse reactions.One patients developed leucopenia. Four patients developed middle anemia. One patients developed severe anaemia and needed blood transfusions. Conclusions Using Linezolid to treat XDR-TB can significantly improve clinical symptoms, promote lesion absorption and cavity closure, and accelerate sputum negative conversion.

Objectives: Tuberculosis meningitis (TBM) has a case fatality rate of >30%. Optimal treatment for TBM has not been established and follows the model of pulmonary TB treatment. Moxifloxacin, because of its potencyand good penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a promising drug for TBM. Higher doses of moxifloxacin as well as rifampicin may increase drug exposure in blood and CSF, thereby improving survival. This study evaluates the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and efficacy of such an intensified regimen for TBM in a hospital in Indonesia. Methods: We randomized 60 Indonesian TBM patients (10% HIVinfected) to standard dose (450 mg, 10 mg/kg) oral rifampicin or high dose (600 mg, 13 mg/kg) rifampicin administered i.v., and (in a second randomization) to moxifloxacin 400 mg, moxifloxacin 800 mg, or ethambutol 750 mg QD, for the first 14 days and in adjunction to standard INH, PZA and dexamethason. After the first two weeks of treatment all patients continued with standard TB treatment. Pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments were performed in blood and CSF within the first critical 4 days of treatment, adverse events attributable to TB treatment were assessed, and 1 month mortality was evaluated. This explorative study was powered to detect pharmacokinetic differences between groups.",

Mean CSF concentrations for rifampicin were low and showed only a small increase with a higher dose (0.50 vs. 0.37 mg/L). Mean CSF concentrations for moxifloxacin were 1.7 vs. 3.9 mg/L (p < 0.05) for standard vs. high dose moxifloxacin. Among the first 48 patients included, mild QTc prolongation occurred in 48% of patients taking moxifloxacin, while grade 3 (10%) and grade 4 (6%) hepatotoxicity was evenly distributed between groups. One-month mortality among the first 48 patients included, was substantially lower (31% vs. 57%, p = 0.07) in patients taking high-dose rifampicin i.v. compared to those taking standard dose orally. Conclusion: Intensified antibiotic treatment for TBM leads to more favorable PK in plasma (rifampicin and moxifloxacin) and in CSF (moxifloxacin), with acceptable toxicity. Preliminary data in this explorative study show a trend for lower mortality in patients taking high dose rifampicin. Larger studies should evaluate the effect of intensified treatment on survival of patients with TBM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen which is ubiquitous in soil and water. It is however able to cause severe infections in humans and in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients it is the dominant cause of morbidity and mortality due to its persistence in the airways of these patients. Our main objective has been to characterize the evolutionary routes by which these bacteria switch from an environmental life-style to one associated with chronic infections. Helped by a substantial strain collection covering several hundred CF patients with lung infections lasting for up to 35 years we have been able to identify particularly successful clones whose changing genome sequences and global gene expression profiles have constituted an important platform for our analysis. The genome dynamics reflect in many cases the frequent appearance of hyper-mutator strains, in which mutations accumulate with rates which are up to 1000 fold increased relative to what is observed in non-mutator isolates. In these cases the airway populations of P. aeruginosa are highly diverse and adaptation to the changing environments in the CF airways seems to occur at the population level. In contrast, very successful non-mutator clones seem to harbor several mutations in global regulatory genes, which result in highly adapted cells and quite homogeneous airway populations. Through allelic replacement wild-type strains of P. aeruginosa have been constructed, which carry one or more of the identified regulatory mutations from clinical isolates, and the resulting strains display phenotypes with profiles resembling those of the clinical strains. These results suggest that a small number of specific regulatory mutations, altering networks of transcription in the bacteria, may provide the cells with adaptive features that lead to high fitness levels of the bacteria in their new environment. The latest results from these on-going studies of gene regulation in CF isolates and their synthetic counter-parts will be discussed.",

Predictive models in adult nonneutropenic critically ill patients allow stratification and selection of high-risk patients for C/IC who may benefit from early antifungal therapy. Our group has developed and validated the ''Candida score'', a predictive model of IC, based on a scoring system for certain variables, which assigns a value of 1 point for surgery, multifocal colonization and parenteral nutrition, and a value of two points severe sepsis. A cutoff of \u20213 is highly reliable to identify patients at high risk of C/IC. Moreover, abdominal surgery increases significantly the risk of C/IC. Based on these results, early antifungal treatment can be specifically directed to patients with multifocal Candida colonization and associated Candida score \u20213 and, in particular, to those with abdominal surgery. This scoring system is simple and may be of help to clinicians to differentiate between Candida spp. colonization and occult invasive fungal infection when early antifungal treatment is considered. Serological tests have been recently added to the diagnostic armamentarium of C/IC, including detection of Candida albicans germ tube antibodies (CAGTA) and (1,3)-Beta-D-Glucan (BDG). A recent metaanalysis concluded that BDG has good diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing patients with and without invasive fungal infection. Proper use of this test requires good knowledge of its characteristics, particularly the fungal pathogens that remain undetected and the factors associated with a false-positive result. PCR-based methods to detect Candida spp. directly in blood samples may play an important role in improving the outcome of patients with IC through an earlier and more sensitive diagnosis. A recently published meta-analysis has demonstrated the usefulness of this method, which may accompany blood cultures, although serial sampling may be considered for patients at high risk for IC. This systematic review demonstrated that direct PCR in blood samples may have higher sensitivity for the diagnosis of IC than conventional blood cultures, with a specificity of 90%. Therefore, stratification of patients at high risk for IC with the use of a predictive model of IC together with measurements of biomarkers (BDG and CAGTA) and the possibility of having available diagnostic tests based on real time PCR may change the outcome of patients with IC.",

            "text": "Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are a group of remarkably diverse DNA viruses from the Papillomaviridae family, which are causally involved in the etiology of various benign and malignant neoplastic lesions of mucosal and skin epithelium. Approximately 40 different HPV types from the alpha genus are known to infect mucosal epithelium, with a subset of 10-12 HPV types being associated with lesions that can progress to cancer. These cancer-associated HPVs are designated as high-risk HPV types (hr-HPV) and are the etiological agents of virtually all cervical carcinomas and play the leading etiological role in the development of anal cancer and a substantial proportion of vaginal, penile, vulvar and oropharyngeal (mainly tonsillar) cancers. In view of the fact that persistent infection with hr-HPVs is a necessary etiological factor in the development of cervical carcinoma, HPV testing has become an important part of cervical carcinoma screening and detection algorithms in several countries. Testing for hr-HPVs has four main clinical applications: (i) triage of women with ASC-US or other borderline cytology, (ii) follow-up of women with abnormal screening cytology results who are negative at initial colposcopy/biopsy, (iii) prediction of the outcome after treatment of CIN2+ and (iv) primary screening of women aged 30 years and more in combination with Pap smear. Currently more than 80 different commercial assays for the detection of alpha HPVs are available (reviewed in Poljak M, Kocjan BJ. Exp Rev Anti Infect Ther 2010;8:1139-62) and can be provisory divided into five main groups: (i) DNA-based screening assays, which test for the presence of 13-14 hour-HPVs without determination of HPV type; (ii) assays that combine testing for 14 hours -HPVs and HPV-16 and HPV-18 genotyping; (iii) HPV DNA based genotyping assays, (iv) mRNA hr-HPV assays and (v) in situ hybridization HPV assays. The vast majority of HPV assays currently on the market are not useful for the established clinical applications and especially not for primary screening. Automation, price reduction and improvement of clinical specificity are the main goals for the future development of HPV assays.",

Additionally women report more severe reaction to influenza vaccines. Overall, studies to identify the differences to response to vaccines are scarce.Nevertheless, studies on sex-related immune response and response to vaccination are needed to define futures strategies for vaccination programs. Gender related responsiveness to vaccines are another issue to be addressed. Gender and immunisation has been a topic to be assessed by the WHO and partner for statistical analysis of demographic health surveys, qualitative systematic review and case studies. The compilation of the data showed that vaccinations outcomes with regard to both sexes were variable within the studies countries.

All isolates were re-identified to the species level using standard microbiological methods. PCR detection of mecA and lukS-PV/lukF-PV genes was performed. The isolates were characterised by spa-typing, RM test typing, agr typing and SCCmec typing. MLST was performed for selected isolates representing different centres. Results: All MRSA isolates were grouped into 11 clonal complexes, namely: CC5 (n = 296; 46%), CC22 (n = 148; 23%), CC8 (n = 115; 17.8%); CC80 (n = 34; 5.3%) CC30 (n = 21; 3.3%), CC398 (n = 13; 2%), CC45 (n = 6; 0.9%), CC1 (n = 5; 0.7%), CC59 (n = 2; 0.3%), CC152 (n = 2; 0.3%) and CC7 (n = 1; 0.1%). 567 (88.2%) isolates belonged to hospital-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) lineages, 63 (9.8%) to community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) lineages, whereas 13 (2%) to livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) lineages. 10 (1.5%) isolates represented sporadic MRSA clones. Among HA-MRSA lineages the most predominant clones were: Southern German (ST228-I and related, n = 152) observed mostly in Switzerland, Italy and Serbia; EMRSA-15 (ST22-IVh and related, n = 148) observed mostly in Scotland and Spain and EMRSA-2/-6 (ST8-IVc, n = 93) observed mostly in France. CA-MRSA clones, European (ST80-IVc, n = 34) and Southwest Pacific (ST30-IVc and related, n = 18) dominated in Greece. Overall, the most disseminated clone was EMRSA-15, observed in seven out of nine centres, followed by EMRSA-2/-6 and Southern German clones, in five and three out of nine centres, respectively. The most prevalent SCCmec type was IV (n = 347) followed by SCCmec type I (n = 157), II (n = 61) and III (n = 20). Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) was carried only by isolates belonged to CA-MRSA clones (n = 42).

On the other hand, hospitals that performed competence assessment of their personnel's ability to insert and maintain these lines showed significantly lower MRSA proportions. Even in low prevalence hospitals, central venous catheter (CVC) care bundles were reported by no more than 45.5% of hospitals; in turn, only 72.1% of these institutions documented compliance whereas just 25% of them performed bundle audit and feedback at least every 6 months.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Whereas IPC policies are abundantly present in European hospitals, efforts to ensure that staff are competent in the performance of those same policies appear sub-optimal. In addition, a higher MRSA prevalence also seems to be related to less intensive surveillance and especially to lack of efforts to identify and correct causative aetiological factors through root cause analysis. Effective CVC care bundles are also still absent in most hospitals. IPC practices in European hospitals seem to lack the requirements of good practice and clearly need to learn from safer industries, such as aviation, if improvements in MRSA bacteraemia epidemiology are to be achieved. Methods: Sixteen hospital laboratories across England, Wales and Northern Ireland were requested to refer up to 10 consecutive MRSA and MSSA from bacteraemia cases within the period from January to July 2011. Patient demographic data were collated. Genetic characterisation included spa typing, mecA PCR, MLVA and SCCmec typing. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by agar dilution (BSAC method) and interpreted using EUCAST guidelines. Results: Overall, 165 isolates (107 MSSA; 58 MRSA) were referred from the participating laboratories. Patients were aged 0 to 96 years; >55% were from the 65+ age group. All but one MRSA tested were ciprofloxacin resistant. Resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin and fusidic acid was observed in 19, nine and four SA isolates respectively. Among MRSA, 27 spa types were identified; t032 was predominant (n = 23) and 81% of all the MRSAs belonged to CC22 (EMRSA-15, as inferred from spa typing data). Meticillin resistance in this group was associated with SCCmec type IV. Other SCCmec types detected included types I (t688), V (t904, t4303); some SCCmec elements proved non-typable (t024 and t190). Among the MSSAs, 44 spa typesclustered into eight inferred clonal complexes and 22 genetically unrelated lineages -were identified. Five major spa types (t002, t008, t012, t015, and t084) accounted for 26% of the total MSSA. MLVA increased discriminatory power: 116 distinct profiles were identified. Specifically, the predominant spa type among the MRSA (t032) was sub-divided into 9 distinct MLVA types. PVL was not detected in MRSA, but 4 MSSA (t355, t315 and t3841) were PVL-positive. Conclusion: Based on the spa type data, there were no significant changes in the genetic structure of SA bacteraemia in the UK in 2011 compared with 2006. The MSSA remain heterogeneous with multiple lineages identified. EMRSA-15 (CC22-SCCmec IV) remains the predominant MRSA clone associated with bacteraemia in the UK. Objectives: The aim of this study was to characterize invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates collected during a 2011 6-month period in France and compare data with those obtained in 2006 using the same protocol. Methods: We conducted a prospective multicenter study of invasive (bacteraemia) MRSA strains, including the first five consecutive blood culture isolates, collected between January and July 2011 in 29 hospitals located throughout France. The strains were extensively characterized using antibiotic susceptibility patterns, agr typing, spa typing, SCCmec typing, toxin profiling and DNA microarrays (StaphyType, Alere). Clones were designated by their sequence type (ST) followed by their SCCmec type (I to VI) .",

Using ApaI-PFGE, seven pulsotypes (A-G) were detected, with types A and B accounting for 67% of the strains. SCCmec type V was found in 23 isolates and the other three were SCCmec type IV. Six different spa types were identified: t011 (68%), t1197 (8%), t1451 (4%), t1255 (8%), t108 (8%) and t889 (4%). One strain was spa negative both by PCR and microarray analysis. Tet-R was mediated by tet(M) and tet(K) in 18 isolates. Ciprofloxacin resistance was 65%. Resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin, erm(C) mediated, was 27%. Multiresistance was detected in 11 isolates (42%) and four (15%) showed expanded resistance patterns (R to six or more antibiotic classes). All isolates carried genes codifying a type 5 capsule.

Conclusion: Although a rare pathogen, in the last two years the number of MRSA-ST398 isolates infecting or colonizing pts has increased significantly in our setting. Pts harboring this clone were often debilitated by underlying diseases. Genetic variability was high among the MRSA-ST398 isolates and near half of the isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics. Objectives: There are four distinct serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) and each of these serotypes may cause disease ranging from mild febrile illness to devastating manifestations including Dengue hemorrhagic fever and Dengue shock syndrome. Disease severity of DENV infection appears to be controlled by the presence of cross-reactive DENV antibodies directed against the envelope (E) and precursor membrane (prM) by facilitating antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. We recently reported that immature DENV turns highly infectious in the presence of prM antibodies. These antibodies facilitate efficient binding and cell entry of immature particles into Fc-receptor expressing cells. In addition, enzymatic activity of furin present in the endosome is critical to render the internalized immature virus infectious. In this study, we analyzed if antibodies recognizing the E protein can also promote viral infectivity of immature virus particles.",

While most antibodies promoted infection, some did not. Anti-E mAbs that do not stimulate viral infectivity may interfere with the conformational change of the virion prior to furin cleavage, or with the fusion process itself. Taken together, our results support the notion that antibodies against the structural proteins prM and E both can enhance infectivity of prM-containing immature and partially mature flavivirus particles. We are currently running experiments using acute sera samples of patients developing different disease outcomes to assess whether immature particles contribute to disease pathogenesis and we anticipate to present these results at the conference as well. Objectives: We recently reported that Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infects the enteric nervous system (ENS) through the orogastric route resulting in gastrointestinal inflammation and dysfunction. Since the ENS possesses the molecular machinery to recognize and react to viral infections we decided to decode the functional relevance of toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 in mediating the response to HSV-1 and investigate whether innate immunity driven responses can harm neuronal functional integrity. Methods: Adult C57Bl/6 (WT) and TLR2 knock-out (KO) mice were inoculated with HSV-1 intranasally and after 4 weeks (W) intragastrically (IG). Mice were sacrificed 1-8W post IG. RNA was extracted from longitudinal muscle myenteric plexus (LMMP) to evaluate viral transcripts. Distal ileum segments were assessed for changes in muscle tension, using electric field stimulation in isolated organ baths, and for ENS integrity by immuno-fluorescence on whole mount preparations. Immune cells from mucosa and LMMP were analyzed by fluorescent activated flow cytometry (FACS). Results: In WT mice HSV-1 latency-associated transcripts (LATs) were detected by 2W post IG, while ICP4 and gC mRNAs were detected only at 6W. Activated CD11+ CD49d+ macrophages infiltrated mucosa at the early stage of infection whereas resident F4/ 80 + cells shown bare phagocytic activity. HSV-1 reactive CD3+ CD8+ lymphocytes were identified in LMMP at 8W post IG. Indeed, at 1 and 8W post IG ileal contractility was reduced and ENS structure damaged (i.e. loss of neuronal HuC/D and glial S100beta immunoreactivity). In TLR2KO mice ICP4 and gC mRNA were detected in the LMMP 1W post IG infection while LATs appeared only at 4W. Indeed, in TLR2KO mice no infiltrating cells were identified but resident mucosal macrophages preserved the phagocytic activity and INF-g production as detected by FACS analysis. During the infection, TLR2KO mice failed to develop a strong adaptive immune response. Intestinal contractility increased at 1-3W post IG infection. Objective: Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is the most frequent complication of acute tonsillitis, and one of the most prevalent causes for acute admission to Otorhinolaryngology Departments. Viral infections have been shown to predispose to the development of acute bacterial complications, such as acute otitis media, sinusitis, and pneumonia. Our aim was to examine whether viruses also play a role in the pathogenesis of PTA. Methods: We have examined both palatine tonsils, from 25 patients undergoing acute tonsillectomy for PTA, using PCR-based assays specific for Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1), Herpes Simplex Virus-2 (HSV-2), Adenovirus, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), Influenza A and B, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) A and B. We similarly examined tonsils from 55 patients undergoing elective tonsillectomy due to recurrent tonsillitis (RT) and/or tonsillar hypertrophy (TH), or persistent sore throat syndrome (PSTS). This elective group served as a control group, as they did not have clinically apparent infection at the time of surgery. Only patients aged 8-30 years, without antibiotic treatment during the month preceding surgery, were included in the study.",

Quantification of EBV load demonstrated no differences between the PTA group and the elective tonsillectomy group, and in the PTA group no differences between the abscessed and the non-abscessed, contralateral tonsil. Concordance between contralateral tonsils was found to be poor for HSV-1 and Adenovirus (20 and 27% concordance, respectively), and high for EBV (94%), likely reflecting the relative viral load of these viruses in the tonsils.",

Nanopillars acts as microfluidic sieve to separate and concentrate different markers of infection from clinical samples which are present in low copies. The antigens are detected and quantified by flowing across an array of cantilever nanosensors functionalised with carefully selected high affinity capture molecules raised against different (sub) types of HIV virions.

The resonance frequency response of a cantilever array (CLA) is tracked using the laser beam deflection method ( Figure  1. ). Frequency shifts are caused by additional mass loading onto the cantilevers. The cantilevers are functionalized with an agarose layer supplemented with culturing medium. Aspergillus niger spores were seeded on the cantilever surface using the ink-jet printing technique. During microbial growth microorganisms assimilate nutrition and water from the nutritive layer and humid air, which results in an increase in the mass on the cantilever. Results: The use of CLA's allows Aspergillus niger growth to be detected within a few hours. Different magnitudes of frequency response due to a different number of viable spores on cantilevers were observed. Initial resonance frequency decrease was detected during fungal growth. The subsequent hypha growth along the cantilevers longitudinal axis resulted in a resonance frequency increase. The use of a reference cantilever allows a differential signal to be recorded. Thus, the true change in resonance frequency can be extracted from the data. The currently used cantilever arrays (eight cantilevers per array) provide the opportunity to perform parallel measurements of different growth conditions (eg.antibiotic susceptibility testing).",

Vaccination is reported to have serious side effects in individuals Novel methods to diagnose infections who had (subclinical) infection with C. burnetii before. According to the manufacturer guidelines, vaccination candidates should therefore be tested by serology and by an intradermal skintest. We developed a feasible antigen-specific interferon-gamma (IFN-g -assay to diagnose previous infection with C. burnetii. In the recent Dutch vaccination campaign we compared this assay with serology and skintest. Methods: For the IFN-g assay heparinised blood was collected and incubated with inactivated whole C. burnetii Nine Mile phase I bacteria for 24 hours. A negative control (no stimulus) and a non-specific control (PHA) were incubated simultaneously. The IFN-g concentration was measured in the supernatant by ELISA. The assay was performed in 1525 vaccination candidates who were also tested serologically and by skin test prior to vaccination. Results: Of 1294 individuals had conclusive results in the IFN-g assay, 1166 individuals had evaluable results for all three tests and were included in the analysis. In the 212 individuals with either a positive serology (n = 136; IgG phase 2 titer \u202132) or a positive skintest (n = 76; induration \u20215 mm), IFN-g production was 402 \u00b1 73 pg/mL (mean \u00b1 SE), significantly (p < 0.0001) higher than 28 \u00b1 6 pg/mL in the 954 seronegative and skin test negative individuals (Figure 1 ). When a positive serology or skin test was used as a marker for as a previous infection with C. burnetii, the ROC-curve of the assay shows a test accuracy of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.80-0.87). Interestingly, the IFN-g production in the 9 patients with a serologic profile compatible with chronic Q fever (defined by the Dutch guidelines for chronic Q fever as IgG phase 1 \u2021 1024) was very high (1716 \u00b1 1053 pg/mL). Conclusion: The Q fever-specific IFN-g assay is a useful method for the detection of individuals who had previous contact with C. burnetii and can be used in pre-vaccination screening. The value of the test in the diagnosis of chronic Q fever deserves further evaluation. Objective: Q fever is a highly contagious zoonotic disease caused by Coxiella burnetii. The presentation of Q fever in humans is variable, from asymptomatic, acute and chronic disease to Q fever fatigue syndrome. It is diagnosed principally by serology and antibody patterns between phase I and II which differentiate between acute, convalescent and chronic Q fever. However, the current serological methods do not discriminate sufficiently or early enough between acute and chronic Q fever during the convalescent stage, making preventative treatment problematic.",

The antibody kinetics and the influence of antibiotic treatment on the antibody response was studied in follow-up samples from 25 patients. Results: Several serological markers were significantly present at higher levels in patients diagnosed with chronic Q fever compared to the acute patients. These detected markers may therefore be a better indicator for chronic disease than the level of the IgG phase 1 in the Immuno Fluorescence Assay. A decrease in antibody responses was observed in follow up serum samples after acute infection and during treatment of chronic Q fever. We observed possible reactivation in at least two chronic Q fever patients, indicated by an increase in the antibody responses to the identified markers after discontinuation of their antibiotic treatment.",

Use of simple clinical tools (e.g. 7 days' watchful-waiting rule for sinusitis, Anthonisen's criteria) and strep-test needs to be expanded and embedded in daily practice as a means of appropriate antibiotic prescribing. Patients' pressure to prescribe antibiotics may affect physicians' habits in certain cases. Education of both physicians and patients, especially in non-metropolitan areas, could provide a viable solution in combatting antibiotic overprescribing. Objectives: Many countries require a sick note to claim sickness leave or benefits, necessitating patients to consult a physician and often resulting in an antimicrobial prescription. Socio-economic, cultural and health-regulatory determinants have been demonstrated to be correlated with antimicrobial consumption. Therefore we evaluated the possible relation between different legitimate periods of uncertified sickness leave and antibiotic consumption. Methods: Data on the length of sickness leave without medical certification (SLWC) were collected via e-mail surveys, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions and various websites. Countries with self-certification were coded as intrinsically having the longest period. Data on antibiotic consumption between 2000 and 2008 were obtained from the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption database. Using two-tailed Spearman's rho correlations, we compared the SLWC with the mean antibiotic consumption and also the relation between SLWC and other potentially influential parameters such as uncertainty avoidance index (UAI) and power distance index (Deschepper et al, 2008) , age group distribution, physician density and national income (Masiero et al, 2010) and physician consultation rates (Chahwakilian 2011) (Data Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2000-2008) .",

As general practitioners take in charge a lot of UTI, we wanted to know if they knew and followed these guidelines. Methods: We performed a prospective study. The point of call was urinalysis done in an outpatient biological lab that performs bacteriological analysis for many other labs either in town or in the suburbs. Using this selection method coupled with the criteria of urinalysis diagnosis, we were sure that patients presented an UTI.

LightCycler Septifast assay uses a renovated technology that enables the direct detection from blood samples of a wide panel of bacterial and fungal microorganisms commonly involved in systemic infections. Molecular test was performed in only 0.5 mL of blood, instead of 1.5 mL, unlike to manufacturer's instructions, due to difficulties to draw blood from the small veins. In parallel, new cultures were requested, including peripheral blood and umbilical catheter tip cultures. Results: Within 6 hours upon reception of blood for SeptiFast, DNA of S. maltophilia, Esherichia coli and Candida albicans was amplified in the blood sample and reported to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Antifungal treatment with amphotericin B and 5-flucytocine was then promptly added to his therapy. In the following days, culture-based approaches confirmed molecular results. Blood culture was positive for Gram-negative rods, and after two additional days definitive identification of S. maltophilia was obtained as the initial blood culture. E. coli was grown after 24 hour of incubation in the umbilical catheter tip culture. C. albicans was not recovered neither from blood culture, after 5 days of incubation, nor from catheter tip one, but rectal swabs cultures detected the yeast.

Specifically, multi-drug resistant (MDR) gram-negative organisms have become a major concern because of limited treatment options, increased lengths of stay (LOS), costs, and mortality associated with infections. In a study of costs associated with MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa mean cost of hospitalization was $54 081 (mean LOS = 18 days) for patients with MDR isolates vs. $22 116 for susceptible isolates. These increased costs could in part be attributed to a delay in appropriate empiric therapy and the delay's adverse affect on clinical outcome and mortality. A similar study of P. aeruginosa bacteremias indicated hospital mortality was statistically higher for inappropriate empiric therapy compared to appropriate empiric therapy (30.7% vs. 17.8%; p = 0.079).

Objectives: In an era of increasing emergence of azole-resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus, combining antifungal agents may be an alternative approach to improve therapeutic outcomes in azoleresistant invasive aspergillosis (IA). The efficacies of antifungal agents can be described by pharmacodynamic indices (PDIs), such as area under the concentration-time curve above the MIC (AUC > MIC). We explored whether the same PDIs that explain efficacy during monotherapy would explain efficacy during combination therapy in an animal model of IA. Methods: Female CD-1 mice were infected intravenously 24 hours prior to start therapy with VCZ-susceptible and VCZ-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus. Fourteen days efficacy data (survival) were determined for various combination regimens of 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mg/ kg voriconazole (VCZ) plus anidulafungin (AFG) and for each of these agents singly. Groups of 11 mice were treated intraperitoneally once daily, for seven consecutive days. The parameters for each dose as determined from pharmacokinetic experiments, was used to calculate PDI for each strain. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the importance of various PDIs during monotherapy. The efficacies of the combination regimens were then predicted on the basis of a linear regression analysis for the single agents with the highest r2 value and then predictions were compared with the observed outcome of combination therapy to determine the presence of synergism. Objectives: Voriconazole (VCZ) has become the drug of choice for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. Although strains with reduced in vitro susceptibility to VCZ have been described, clinical breakpoints have not yet been defined. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis can help to identify VCZ resistant isolates. The aim of our study was to investigate the efficacy of VCZ against Aspergillus fumigatus (AFM) using a novel in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model for identifying drug-resistant isolates. Methods: Two clinical isolates of AFM with VCZ CLSI MICs of 0.125 mg/L (wild type strain), and 2 mg/L (CYP51 mutation TR/ L98H) were included. standard VCZ dosages 4 mg/kg were simulated in a new in vitro PK simulation system with a half-life of 6h and C max of 1.75 mg/L as observed in patients (Purkins et al, AAC 2002). The new system consists of an internal compartment (IC, a 10 mL dialysis tube made out of semi-permeable cellulose membrane allowing the free diffusion of molecules with MW <20 kDa) placed inside an external compartment (EC, a 700 mL glass beaker) whose content is diluted with a peristaltic pump at the same rate as the clearance of VCZ in human plasma. Aspergillus conidia (10^3/mL) were inoculated inside the IC and VCZ was added in the IC and EC. Drug levels were determined by microbiological methods and fungal growth by measuring galactomannan concentrations in the IC with a sandwich-ELISA (Biorad). The area under the drug concentration-time curve AUC0-24 (PK parameter) and the area under the galactomannan concentration-time curve AUCGI (PD parameter) were determined for each dose and isolate for 24 hour. The percent of growth inhibition at each dose was calculated as 1-AUCGI,VOR/AUCGI,GC where AUCGI,VOR is the AUCGI at a certain VCZ dose whereas AUCGI,GC is the AUCGI of the drug free control. Results: The simulated dose 4 mg/kg of VCZ resulted in fAUC0-24 of 10 mg/hour/L which corresponds to the lower 95% fAUC0-24 (58% protein binding) observed in patients receiving the standard dose of 4 mg/kg (10-44 mg/hour/L, Purkins et al, AAC 2002) . By taking into account the population variability of fAUC0-24 second in patients, growth inhibition 100% was observed for the isolate with an MIC of 0.125 mg/L, but 0% for the isolate with an MIC of 2 mg/L. Conclusion: PK/PD analysis of VCZ's in vitro activity strongly indicates that AFM isolates with VCZ CLSI MICs \u20212 mg/L should be classified as resistant. Objectives: In vivo/in vitro correlation of antifungal combination testing is necessary in order to reliably assess the efficacy of combination regimens. We therefore attempted to correlate in vitro checkerboard testing of posaconazole (POS) and amphotericin B Objectives: Selective Digestive tract Decontamination (SDD) and Selective Oropharyngeal Decontamination (SOD) are associated with improved patient outcome and lower carriage rates of antibioticresistant bacteria (ARB) in ICU-patients in the Netherlands. In both regimens patients receive oropharyngeal decontamination with colistin and tobramycin (4/daily). In SDD (but not in SOD) patients receive intestinal decolonization (colistin and tobramycin (4/daily)) and a 4-day course of cefotaxime. We determined unit-wide effects of SDD and SOD on intestinal carriage with ARB in a 16-center cluster-randomized cross-over CRCO study in The Netherlands, comparing 12 months of SDD and SOD. ",

Public health control is dependent on prevention measures and effective antimicrobial therapy and will be threatened by the emergence of resistance and therapeutic failure to current therapies. Surveillance of gonococcal infections is of paramount importance to monitor the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance and detect drifts in susceptibility in order to inform national and international guidelines. Many countries in Europe maintain national programmes, but with a mobile population it is essential to have a European wide approach to provide timely and co-ordinated information to prevent the spread of antimicrobial resistant gonorrhoea across Europe. Surveillance for gonococcal antimicrobial resistance across Europe was initiated in 2004, and since 2008 has been a component of the European network for the surveillance for sexually transmitted infections, which is co-ordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The aims of the microbiology component are to improve the quality of laboratory surveillance of gonorrhea, Chlamydia (including LGV) and syphilis and to strengthen surveillance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae susceptibility in EU/EEA Member States and candidate countries. A network of reference and expert laboratories participates in the European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Susceptibility Programme, Euro-GASP. The programme consists of a number of components including sentinel surveillance of gonococcal resistance to therapeutic antimicrobial agents, external quality assurance, assessment of laboratory capacity, training courses and use of molecular typing for public health purposes. As decreased susceptibility and therapeutic failure emerges to the current agents of choice in most countries, the extended spectrum cephalosporins, it is paramount that data is obtained and disseminated in a timely manner. To achieve this objective, sentinel surveillance of antimicrobial resistance has been established in 21 countries. Initially testing was centralised and provided annual data but recently has been extended to include decentralised testing and to provide data twice yearly. A key component of Euro-GASP is to provide training to increase capacity in non-participating countries to improve coverage and representativeness.",

Although remarkable progress has been made in lowering the incidence of the disease, the worry is that gonorrhoea is becoming a much more difficult infection to treat, increasing the morbidity and the cost. Recently, scientific communities have been discussing the emergence of an N. gonorrhoeae strain resistant to all antimicrobial drugs available. The new strain is called H041, isolated in Japan, and contains genetic mutations making it resistant to penicillin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and also thirdgeneration cephalosporin, including ceftriaxone widely recommended and the first line treatment for gonorrhoea around the world. For that, the multidrug resistant gonococcus may be considered a superbug that initiates a future era of untreatable gonorrhoea. The resistance to ESCs (extended-spectrum cephalosporins) such as cefixime and ceftriaxone, has been documented to be due to the presence of multiple chromosomal changes in the penA gene that form the basis for this reduced susceptibility/resistance. So, the antimicrobial resistant (AMR-NG), multidrug resistant (MDR-NG) and more recently the extensively drug resistant N. gonorrhoeae (XDR-NG) to different class of antibiotics, are an important public health concern for gonorrhoea. Data from the European surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in gonorrhoea by M. Cole et al 2011, showed that 5% of isolates had decreased susceptibility to cefixime, an upward trend in the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ceftriaxone and a high prevalence of resistance to ciprofloxacin (63%) and azithromycin (13%). In Italy, from 2007 to 2011 around 700 isolates have been tested for their antimicrobials susceptibility. In particular, among 114 gonococci isolated in 2009, seven showed a MDR phenotype due to a resistance to four different antibiotics including cefixime (MIC \u2021 0.125 mg/L). Enhancing systematic and sentinel surveillance for AMR and MDR gonorrhoea by promoting the susceptibility testing and studying the genetic mechanisms of the resistance are priority as key points for a control strategy and for combating the spread of MDR gonococci. A sustained and integrated international effort to reduce rates of gonorrhoea and the misuse of antibiotics is required to stem further emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant strains.",

Soldati* (Geneva, CH) Pathogenic mycobacteria such as Mycobacetrium tuberculosis and M. marinum utilise common strategies to invade phagocytes of the innate immune system, manipulate their otherwise bactericidal phagocytic apparatus and increase the success of cell-to-cell transmission. M. marinum is the closest relative to mycobacteria of the tuberculosis complex and provides a powerful model to study the pathogenesis of tuberculosis in genetically tractable model organisms, such as Drosophila and zebrafish. The soil amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has become a popular experimental model to study the cell-autonomous innate immune response, because D. discoideum and human phagocytes share several conserved functions, such as engulfment killing and digestion of microorganisms by phagocytosis. Using D. discoideum a host, we identify and characterize mycobacterial and host factors that modulate resistance to infection and cell-to-cell spreading. We study bacteria sensing and killing and the role of NADPH-oxidases in ROS production. We study the specific roles of the three NOX isoforms in ROS production and susceptibility to mycobacteria infection. We also study the roles of three paralogs of the CD36 family of scavenger receptor type B. One is present at the surface and acts as a receptor, while the other two are lysosomal and are implicated in trafficking of hydrolases. Like M. tuberculosis in macrophages, M. marinum interferes with phagosome maturation by modulating membrane trafficking events to and from its compartment. We developed both quantitative-comparative proteomic techniques and live cell imaging with various probes of the phagolysosomal pathway to study the mechanisms of maturation arrest. In a final stage of infection, M. marinum and M. tuberculosis escape from their vacuole to the cytosol.",

Overall, our studies demonstrate the conservation of both pathogen virulence strategies and host defence mechanisms, ensuring the success of D. discoideum as a powerful and simple host-pathogen model system to study mechanisms of mycobacterial infection. In that context, our most recent efforts are directed at using this alternative system to screen for small chemicals that interfere with the infection, either as anti-mycobacteria virulence or host immunity-boosting compounds. Results: Ratios of the two strains were skewed towards one or other predominating. This effect was lost on phagocyte depletion. Mathematical modelling of pathogen dynamics was consistent with a small number of bacteria surviving within phagocytes leading to disseminated infection. This was confirmed in a mouse septic arthritis model, in which injected bacteria form abscesses in the kidney. Using two marked strains, these abscesses arose more commonly than expected from predominantly one bacterial population or the other, again suggesting a niche exists in which these bacteria can evade host defence and ultimately re-establish foci of infection. To test whether this niche was within a sub-population of phagocytes, individual populations of neutrophils or macrophages were depleted in the zebrafish. Neutrophil-depleted larvae showed better survival compared to macrophage depleted, but lower variance of the ratios of the two SA strains, suggesting neutrophils might provide a niche in which SA can avoid host killing. Conclusion: We predict that understanding the nature of this phagocyte niche will enable its manipulation, and provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of SA disease. The finding of evolutionary conserved innate immune signaling pathways governing antimicrobial response in Drosophila highly stimulated the understanding of metazoans immune mechanisms. Two major pathways, Toll and Imd, are activated in Drosophila fat body cells following bacterial infections leading to the synthesis of large quantities of antimicrobial peptides secreted in the hemolymph. These pathways can also be differentially activated in exposed epithelial tissues (trachea, gut, genitalia). Following bacterial recognition by immune receptors, signaling is ensured by conserved molecules such as proteases, adaptators, kinases and NF-kB transcription factors. Ubiquitination is also a signaling mechanism conserved from flies to humans; we notably demonstrated that Imd ubiquitination by lysine 63linked Ub chains is required for signal transduction and is controlled by the deubiquitinase USP36/Scny. Beside this humoral response, Drosophila differentiates phagocytic cells, deriving from the hemocyte blood cells lineage, ensuring bacterial phagocytosis as well as cytokines and antimicrobial peptides secretion. By expressing the Pseudomonas aeroginusa ExoS toxin targeting RhoGTPases, we specifically disrupted hemocytes phagocytic function in vivo and demonstrated the essential contribution of Rac2 and phagocytosis in Drosophila immunity together with the feasibility of using transgenesis to investigate the in vivo mechanisms of action of a bacterial toxin.",

In this line, we and others observed that some Pseudomonas strains can establish biofilms in the Drosophila crop or anterior midgut and display reduced virulence towards their host. Undoubtedly, flies still have a high amount of information to deliver about molecular mechanisms and physiology of anti-bacterial defense and bacterial virulence in a living organism. C. elegans is a widely-used model in biology. It has been adopted by a growing community of researchers investigating pathogen virulence and host defences. We use C. elegans to dissect the molecular and cellular basis of innate immunity to fungal infection. C. elegans responds specifically to different types of infection through the activation of distinct signaling pathways. Fungal infection of the epidermis results in the production of multiple effector proteins, including antimicrobial peptides such as NLP-29 or CNC-2. Through a candidate approach and a small-scale EMS screen, using fluorescent reporters, we have identified many components of the innate immunity cascades involved in the regulation of the nlp-29 and cnc-2 genes. We showed that a conserved pathway involving a protein kinase C acting upstream of a p38 MAPK cascade (Ziegler et al., 2009 ) and a noncanonical TGF-beta pathway (Zugasti and Ewbank, 2009) regulate nlp-29 and cnc-2, respectively. The two pathways are linked by a STAT factor that is required for the expression of both genes (Dierking et al., 2011) .",

Patients with a D. fragilis infection suffering from chronic gastro-intestinal complaints that remain unexplained after thorough investigation are therefore often treated with the intention to eradicate the D. fragilis infection from the gut. Since no consensus exists about treatment for dientamoebiasis, we performed a retrospective follow-up study to compare the efficacy of paromomycin, clioquinol and metronidazole. Methods: Patients were included when between January 2004 and January 2011 D. fragilis was demonstrated in a stool sample and results of a follow-up stool sample were available. Paromomycin (three daily doses of 500 mg for 7-10 days), clioquinol (three daily doses of 250 mg for 7 days), metronidazole (three daily doses of 500 mg for 7-10 days), were prescribed off-label and after informed consent of the patient.

The aim of the present study was to analyze the Blastocystis subtypes among the isolates from pediatric patients in Saint-Petersburg and identify the correlation between the subtype and gastrointestinal symptoms. Methods: One thousand and seventy-three stool samples were collected from healthy children or children with gastrointestinal disorders. Seventy eight isolates were positive for Blastocystis. The isolates were analyzed with specific primers for 1-9 type employing PCR. Results: Analysis of the level of Blastocystis colonization showed that subtype 3 was the most common in both symptomatic and asymptomatic groups (73%). Subtype 2 was detected in 24% of all isolates, subtype 1 in 15%, subtype 4 in 2.5% and subtype 7 in 3.8%. Subtypes 2 (32%) and 3 (24%) were found in the isolates from asymptomatic the group without gastrointestinal symptoms. In symptomatic groups we mainly detect subtypes 3 (43.4%) and 1 (22.6%) separately or together (24.5%), subtype 4 in 3.7% and subtype 7 in 5.6% of isolates. Interestingly, only patients from the group with subtype 7 were not sensitive for metronidazole after treatment. Conclusion: The present study suggests that subtype 3 is the most common genotype in pediatric patient in Saint-Petersburg. It is quite possible that subtype 2 is a non-pathogenic genotype of Blastocystis. At the same time subtype 7 might be associated with metronidazole resistance of Blastocystis. These facts clearly demonstrate that there is a need of preliminary identification of the parasite before the treatment. Human giardiasis is considered a zoonotic infection, although the role of animals in the transmission to humans is still unclear. When considering the zoonotic potential of each genotype, the Assemblage A and B are believed to represent a major risk for human health since both appear to be infective to a wide range of wild and domestic host species.",

Objectives: In a previous Cochrane review we showed that oral iron supplementation in malaria endemic areas was not associated with increased mortality or clinical malaria. We preformed a broader metaanalysis and systematic review in order to assess the effect of any type of iron supplementation for children in malaria endemic areas on malaria-related outcomes and overall mortality. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing any iron supplementation (oral, parenteral or food/drink fortification) vs. placebo, no treatment or a control intervention that does not include iron, in children living in malaria endemic areas. Trials that do not report malaria-related outcomes were be excluded. Primary outcomes included clinical malaria and overall mortality. Risk of bias was assessed using domain-based evaluation. All data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using fixed effects meta-analysis, when heterogeneity was not significant (inconsistency measure <50% Background: Malaria morbidity and mortality in Uganda continue to escalate despite standard prevention and control measures currently inplace. Whereas prompt and accurate laboratory diagnosis of malaria is the key to the effective management of malaria, clinical syndromic diagnosis has been the most widely used in Uganda and other resource poor countries. Objective: To determine the incidence of anti-malarial drug abuse among patients clinically diagnosed with malaria in Bushenyi, Uganda. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was undertaken at outpatient departments of ten health center (IIs) in Bushenyi, Uganda between April and June, 2011. Rapid diagnostic Test for malaria parasites was performed on recruited 217 female patients (66.2%) and 111 male patients (33.8%) who were clinically diagnosed with malaria. Fifteen health workers at the ten participating health centre IIs were interviewed on criteria used to prescribe anti-malarial drugs and ten key informants interviewed on how they perceived being treated without laboratory results. Rapid diagnostic test were used for the malaria test Results: All (100%) health workers found in the 10 participating health Centre IIs in Bushenyi district were aware of the new policy of routine malaria laboratory diagnosis of all malaria case suspects, but they were all still using the presumptive treatment of malaria basing on clinical signs and symptoms because they had no access to laboratory services. Anti-malarial drugs were wrongly prescribed for febrile patients in 93.6% of the total time malaria was diagnosed in the health centers. Thus this study shows that antimalarial drugs were correctly administered to febrile patients in 6.4% of the total time malaria fever were suspected confirming the fact that 93.6% of the febrile patients who received malaria drugs simply abused it because they had no malaria disease. Conclusion: In our study we did not find a significant difference in mortality between patients with BSI due to ESBL positive E. coli and BSI with non-ESBL producing E. coli. However, patients who suffered a BSI from an ESBL producing E. coli stay significantly longer in the hospital than patients with a BSI due to a non-ESBL producing E. coli strain. Furthermore we have to determine how many patients with sepsis due to an ESBL positive E.coli strain directly received adequate antimicrobial therapy. Microbiological reports were probabilistically linked to England Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data, which captures data on admission and discharge dates. Reports for children who had a positive blood culture taken two or more days after admission were defined as HA BSI and were analysed in terms of pathogen and AMR.",

Enterococcus faecalis represented the main enterococcal isolated strain. HLAR is an increasingly common resistance mechanism, accounting for 36.4% of our enterococcal endocarditis cases. Although limited by its number, our report shows good results of daptomycin use either alone or in association with ampicillin for the treatment of these infections. tigecycline, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, rifampicin and ciprofloxacin were determined with broth microdilution method; for daptomycin the Etest method was used. Results were interpreted with the EUCAST and CLSI breakpoints. Patients' clinical and epidemiological data provided in the questionnaire were also analyzed. Results: Among patients 56% were men and 42% women (2%, gender not reported). Age distribution was as follows: 2.3% newborns, 5.8% age 1-25, 15.5% age 25-50, 37.8% age 50-65 and 37.8% above 65 years old (no data for 0.8%). Mortality rate was 17.0%. The most frequent causes of hospitalization were bloodstream infections (bacteraemia 42.8.%, and septicaemia 21.6%); other diseases included abdominal infections, chest infections, endocarditis, pelvic infections and meningitis. Risk factors involved: hospitalization during last 6 months (47.1%), ICU stay (22.4%) and surgery (24.7%). Among isolates 141 (54.4%) were classified as Enterococcus faecalis, 113 (43.6%) as Enterococcus faecium and 5 (2.0%) as other Enterococcus spp. The ratios of nonsusceptibility among E. faecalis and E. faecium were as follow: penicillin 0% and 92%, ampicillin 1.4% and 97.3%, vancomycin 16.3% and 10.6%, teicoplanin 0.7% and 6.2%, gentamicin 54.6% and 86.7%, streptomycin 53.2% and 88.5%, linezolid 0% and 0.9%, tigecycline 2.1% and 9.7%, tetracycline 90.0% and 56.6%, chloramphenicol 29.8% and 21.2%, rifampicin 67.4% and 94.7, ciprofloxacin 60.3% and 100%, daptomycin 0% and 0%, respectively. Conclusion: Nearly the same number of E. faecalis and E.faecium was observed in invasive infections from May 2011 till June 2011 in Poland. The infections affected mainly patients older than 50 years and mortality rate was 17%. High ratio of non-susceptibility to older antibiotics was observed with the exception of glycopeptides, but very good susceptibility to new antibiotics: tigecycline, linezolid and daptomycin was detected. specialities. MDR was more prevalent in isolates from blood of patients aged 1-44 years (7%) than in those of 45-74 (4%) or \u202175 years (2%); the 5 individual agents all showed the same downward trend of NS with increasing age. Isolates from children under one were less commonly MDR (2%), with most agents, especially ciprofloxacin, showing less NS than in older patients. RTI P. aeruginosa showed a similar pattern of NS with age. Blood isolates originating from the genitourinary tract were less often MDR (1%) compared with those from other known sources (4-6%). Conclusion: The main factors predicting increased MDR in P. aeruginosa were ICU location and younger age (except infants); genitourinary focus of infection was associated with reduced MDR. Multiple NS in blood and respiratory infections was not unduly prevalent in recent years, with 7-13% of isolates NS to \u20212 agents, 3-7% NS to \u20213, and 1-2% NS to \u20214. Occasional isolates (<1%) were NS to all five tested agents. Overall, Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to third generation cephalosporins in 18.2%, to aminosides in 11.9% and to fluoroquinolones in 17.9%. The resistance rate of A.baumannii was 25.8% for ceftazidim and 6.8% for imipenem. The resistance rate of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidim and imipenem were 13.8% and 15.5%, respectively.",

West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus belonging to the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex in the family Flaviviridae. WNV is maintained in an enzootic cycle between birds and ornithophilic mosquitoes, mainly Culex species, while humans, horses, and other mammals are considered incidental or dead-end hosts. Infection in humans mainly occurs asymptomatically or, in approximately 20% of cases, with a febrile illness, while, in <1% of infections, it occurs with a neuroinvasive disease, which is often severe or even lethal in elderly and immunocompromised individuals. First isolated in 1937 in the district of West Nile in Uganda, in the last 30 years the virus has been responsible for several human and equine outbreaks in Europe and in the Mediterranean basin. In recent years, epidemics caused by WNV in humans and horses have become more frequent in Southern European countries, such as Italy and Greece. The increasing number of WNV outbreaks is associated with the emergence of novel viral strains, which display higher virulence and greater epidemic potential for humans. In addition, both WNV lineage 1 and lineage 2 have been isolated in recent years in European countries. Recent research findings on WNV epidemiology, biology, vaccines and drugs under development will be presented.",

Hantaviruses are found worldwide and are known to cause two serious and often fatal human diseases: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Asia and Europe and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas. The mortality rates vary from 12% in HFRS up to 50% in HCPS. Both diseases are acute febrile infections, usually acquired through inhalation of aerosols or dust particles contaminated with virus containing rodent excreta. HFRS is characterized by renal failure and hemorrhagic manifestations that vary from petechiae to severe internal bleeding. Pneumonia and cardiovascular dysfunction are characteristic of HCPS. Increased permeability of micro vascular endothelium seems to be a common effect of hantavirus infection. Although, the pathogenesis of hantavirus infection is poorly understood, it is suggested that not the direct viral cytopathology, but immune mechanisms may play an important role in a complex pathogenesis. The diagnosis of acute hantavirus infection is primarily based on serology, since viral RNA cannot be regularly detected in the blood or urine of patients. For immunization, inactivated virus vaccines are licensed in certain Asian countries. Moreover, several classical and molecular vaccine approaches are in pre-clinical stages of development.",

Any antibiotic use selects for resistant bacteria and we use antibiotics extensively to treat and prevent infections in humans and animals; the sequelae impact also on the environment. Resistance is as old as antibiotic production, and many of the resistance genes that we recognize today evolved millennia ago. These genes have moved through bacterial ecosystems to genera in the environment and in animal (including human) hosts, and some eventually reach a species that causes infection and is subjected to susceptibility testing. Multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae are one of the greatest challenges encountered by clinical microbiologists, and we have witnessed two waves since 2000. Broad usage of oxyimino-cephalosporins selected first for ESBL producers, particularly those with CTX-M enzymes and, to a lesser extent, bacteria with acquired AmpCs. These were countered by increasing use of carbapenems for serious infections, and in consequence we now face an international onslaught of Enterobacteriaceae that have acquired a diverse array of carbapenemases. These acquired beta-lactamases are usually encoded on plasmids that encode resistance to multiple other antibiotic classes. Genome sequencing reveals that these plasmids are built in modular fashion; a fundamental selfreplicating backbone of essential genes then accumulates resistance genes through successive rounds of transposition and recombinational events. Plasmids can be considered ''successful'' if they are readily transmissible between bacterial strains, species or genera and/or if they are hosted by a successful bacterial strain or clone. Both scenarios have contributed to the global dissemination of ESBLs and carbapenemases, with exposure to antibiotics the most obvious and direct selective pressure. With few new antibiotics in development, preserving the efficacy of those we have must be a priority for all prescribers.",

Control groups include: (i) nine patients with chronic staphylococci BJI without SCV phenotype (SCV-BJI group; all with implant; five due to S. aureus, four to CNS); (ii) six patients with chronic BJI due to other pathogens (other BJI group; three with implants); and (iii) 19 healthy volunteers (HV). PBMC isolated from patients were analyzed for surface CD3, CD8, CD56, CD57, CD69, NKG2D, CD16, NKp30, 2B4, DNAM1 and intracellular perforin and NKG7 expression using multiparameter flow cytometry. In a separate set of experiments, PBMC were stimulated for 4 hours with or without K562 cells (classical NK cell targets). Degranulation (CD107a exposure) and intracellular IFN-g expression by gated NK cells were measured by flow cytometry. Objectives: In human leishmaniasis Th1/Th2 dichotomy and the role of CD8+ T cells in protection is not clearly defined. In this study based on CCR7 expression total memory vs. na\u00efve CD8+ T cell populations were isolated from volunteers with self-healed cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and cytokine productions were analysed. Methods: Leishmanin skin test (LST) was performed for all volunteers. Blood samples were collected from 13 volunteers with history of CL caused by either L. major or L. tropica and 18 healthy volunteers from non-endemic area. Using enrichment cocktail mAbs and magnetic nanoparticles CD14+CD16-monocytes and total memory CD8+ T cells were isolated from autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). For na\u00efve T cells, non-naive cells depleted and CD8+ T cells positively selected using CD8 microbeads. Monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) were produced by incubation of adherent monocytes in cRPMI at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 6 days. Isolated T lymphocyte populations were co-cultured with 1:10 autologous MDM in the presence of PHA or soluble Leishmania antigen (SLA). Cytokine productions were titrated on culture supernatant after 72 hours incubation at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. Part of the SLA cultured cells was harvested, stimulated with PMA/Ionomycin calcium, permeabilized, stained for intracellular IFN-g, and analyzed using flow cytometer. Results: The mean diameters of skin indurations were significantly higher in CL volunteers (8.7 \u00b1 3.62 mm) compared to healthy controls (0 mm) (p < 0.005). The mean \u00b1 SD percentage of memory T cells was 5 \u00b1 1.8% and of na\u00efve T cells was 9 \u00b1 2.2% retrieving from PBMC. Stimulation of isolated CD8+ memory T cells from CL volunteers induced a significantly higher IFN-g production compared with that of controls (p < 0.005). No significant difference was seen in the production of IFN-g from naive T cells and in the production of IL-10 from na\u00efve or memory T cells between CL and controls. Significantly higher numbers of memory CD8+ T cells from CL volunteers were positive for intracellular IFN-g than the same cells from controls (p < 0.001).

In analogy to other CMV antigens, host immune pressure may be expected to generate genetic diversity in the UL32-gene. Particularly CMV strains in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) may be under a strong evolutionary force. The immunoglobulin (Ig) expressed on selected leukemic cells interacts with pUL32 and these cells constitute >90% of the leukocyte fraction in CLL patients. Nevertheless, knowledge on genomic diversity of the UL32 gene coding for pUL32 among clinical strains is very limited, so far. Methods: We screened 200 consecutive CLL patients for the presence of CMV-DNA and sequenced the UL32 gene to determine the genomic diversity among clinical CMV strains. Results were analyzed with respect to CMV-seropositivity and sequence of the Ig expressed on leukemic cells.

Polychromatic flow cytometry and CBA flex was applied for detailed analyses of PBMC populations and circulating cytokines, respectively. Immunogenicity of TBEV-vaccine was used as a marker for immunocompetence and negatively correlated with immune senescence. Predictors of vaccine immunogenicity were analysed by multivariable logistic regression. Results: Geometric mean titer (GMT) of TBEV-specific ELISA, neutralizing antibodies and T cell frequencies were significantly lower in HCMV-positive compared to HCMV-negative elderly, particularly early after primary immunization (NT week 8: 13.5 vs. 30.5; p = 0.002). HCMV-infection was associated with profound alterations of lymphocyte subset distribution, of T cell activation, differentiation and regulation and of blood dendritic cells but not with significant changes in cytokine levels.

Mice were sacrificed and organs (liver, spleen, bone marrow and blood) investigated for the presence of Hz. To look at the interference of Hz in vaccination, C57BL/6 mice were infected with P. berghei NK65 followed by treatment with CQ (mice cleared parasite but Hz still remains in the organs). Mice were then immunized with whole irradiated sporozoites and after 10 days challenged with live sporozoites. Liver infection load was determined 42 hours after challenge by real-time PCR. In parallel mice were injected with Hz and then immunized followed by challenge. Native and synthetic Hz was produced and characterized by several methods. Results: Our results showed that Hz was detectable in the host for up to 200 days with the spleen as the major organ for Hz deposition. Immunized mice which had a previous malaria infection seemed to have a reduced protection relative to na\u00efve immunized mice. Also, mice injected with Hz at time of vaccination had undetectable levels of antibodies against sporozoites. Hz characterization by SEM showed that Hz produced by us is structurally equivalent to others, with crystals in the size range of 0.7-1.6 um. Conclusions: In highly endemic areas continuous infections with malaria can potentially lead to a certain level of Hz accumulation in host organs. Thus if Hz has a role in immunesuppression it can potentially interfere with the response to other infections or to vaccination. Our results seem to indicate that this maybe the case, because Hz appeared to cause a degree of immunesuppression capable of reducing the protective efficacy of a malaria vaccine, using whole irradiated parasites. This was shown by a higher liver infection on mice with a previous blood stage and undetectable antibody production against sporozoites when immunization was given together with hemozoin. Objectives: Staphylococcus aureus Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is a pore-forming toxin associated with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), severe osteomyelitis and necrotising pneumonia. PVL prevalence in S. aureus strains is highly variable worldwide. Recent epidemiological data indicate that prevalence rates of PVL-positive isolates are highest in Africa, but they decline from West and Central Africa to North Africa. Whether variations in PVL prevalence influence immunity to PVL in the general population is unknown. We addressed this question by comparing the levels of PVL antibodies in the general populations of France (Europe), Algeria (North Africa) and Senegal (West Africa).",

PVL and alpha-toxin antibody levels were determined by ELISA. Because alpha-toxin is present in all S. aureus strains, its antibody level was considered to reflect the level of population exposure to S. aureus. Results: As compared to France, the median PVL antibody level was 1.7-fold higher in the Algerian population and 7.5-fold higher in the Senegalese population (p < 0.001 for all differences, Mann-Whitney U-test). PVL seropositivity rates in France, Algeria and Senegal were 3.5%, 16.0% and 71.6%, respectively (p < 0.01 for all differences, Chisquare test). On the other hand, there was no significant difference in alpha-toxin antibody levels among patients of the three countries, showing that the observed differences in PVL antibody levels were not biased by variations in population exposure to S. aureus. Conclusion: PVL antibody levels in the general populations of France, Algeria and Senegal vary widely and match variations of PVL-positive S. aureus strains prevalence with an increasing north-south gradient. We conclude that immunity to PVL in a given population is related to the local PVL prevalence. In the light of recent reports suggesting that PVL-directed immunity protects against severe deep-seated infections, but might enhance susceptibility to SSTIs, this finding has important implications for understanding the varying clinical patterns of PVLassociated infections between low and high PVL prevalence areas.",

Objectives: To evaluate the effect of levamisole combined with the standard treatment vs. the standard treatment on the phagocytic function of polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMNs) and monocytes and to determine also the antibody dependent cytotoxicity of isolated monocytes in patients with active brucellosis. Methods: Patients were randomly divided into two groups: Group-I who received standard treatment (doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily and streptomycin, 1.0 g once daily over 3 weeks) and group II who received standard treatment as in group-I plus levamisole (100 mg once daily over 3 weeks). Demographic data and clinical features of the patients were documented on a designed form. Chemiluminenescence (CL) of the oxidative burst was used to determine the PMNs and monocytes phagocytic activity in the blood samples collected. Further, the isolated monocytes' ADCC was detected using nucleated target cell suspension at 630 nm.

Methods Ten S. aureus isolates causing complicated and ten causing uncomplicated BSI were randomly selected to assess their susceptibility to LL-37. Both methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates were included (n = 16 and n = 4). All isolates were positive for the multiple peptide resistant factor (mprF) gene which codes for lysylphosphatidylglycerol (L-PG) synthase except one causing complicated infection and one causing uncomplicated infection. Bactericidal activity was determined from viable cell counts following incubation of 5 \u00b7 10 5 CFU/mL S. aureus with 2.5 lg/mL LL-37 for 1 hour compared to assays containing no LL-37. Objectives: Recent work in our lab has demonstrated that polyclonal Bcell activation with TI-II antigen mimics (e.g a-d-dextran) are able to inhibit the TCR-induced proliferation and activation of T-cells. Based on the fact that TI-II antigens are present in bacteria, we investigated whether N. meningitidis was able to induce B-cell activation but suppress T-cell proliferation and activation. Methods: Primary human PBMCs were exposed to fixed N. meningitidis (whole bacteria) or to purified Neisseria outer membrane vesicles. A flow cytometry assay was designed to measure stimulatory interactions of B and T-cells. Proliferation was measured using a CFSE dilution assay, while cellular activation was assessed by expression of activation markers. Enrichment experiments by negative selection provided pure primary T and B populations for cell-contact experiments.",

Higher bacterial count (100:1) failed to inhibit T-cell activation and the inhibition on T-cell proliferation was mild. The same experiment performed with a lipooligosaccharides (LOS) deficient mutant showed a similar suppressive pattern, being the smallest inocula the most effective dose and suggesting that LOS is not the mechanism of inhibition. Purified fresh and heated outer membrane vesicles of both N. meningitidis and N. lactamica demonstrated to contain the suppressive factor, being effective even at small concentrations and implying that the capsule is not the key factor either. Purification experiments have suggested that B-cells might be the cell type responsible of this phenomenon; however they seem to require other accessory cells from the PBMCs to achieve a regulatory phenotype. Latest experiments with E. coli and S. pneumoniae have clarified that such suppressive effect may be exhibited by bacteria other than N. meningitidis, but that the resultant inhibition is dose sensitive and varies among organisms. Conclusion: Small bacterial inocula of N. meningitidis and its outer membrane vesicles are able to inhibit T-cell proliferation and activation. Still unclear whether the B and T-cell contact is required or if a soluble factor within the PBMCs is a key factor. Other microorganisms seem to exhibit the same phenomenon.

Consecutive adult patients admitted for IV treatment of CAP were identified by screening admission lists. On day three of antibiotic treatment, clinical response was scored by objective parameters for clinical stability and treating residents were interviewed on their switch strategies and potential barriers in individual cases. Additionally, all residents and specialists responsible for the treatment choices were interviewed to evaluate their knowledge and adherence to guideline advice. Results: Of 162 enrolled patients, 13 (8%) were excluded, leaving 149 patients for analysis. They were treated by 107 physicians, of which 97 (91%) were interviewed. Based on clinical parameters, a switch to oral antibiotics was possible in 68/149 (46%) patients on day 3 of treatment, but not performed in 27/68 (40%). Patient factors delaying the switch were a high CURB-score on admission (p = 0.04), oxygen treatment (p = 0.04), high temperature (p = 0.00) and high respiration rate (p = 0.04) on day 3. The clinical experience of physicians was not related to duration of IV therapy. Physicians' barriers (n = 47) to an early switch in clinically stable patients were mainly practical considerations (n = 13, 28%), organisational factors (n = 8, 17%) and misconceptions (n = 26, 55%). Strikingly, 91/97 of (94%) physicians were not aware of guideline advice and 59/116 (51%) of patients marked as clinically stable by residents, did not meet objective parameters for clinical stability.

            "text": "O403 Antibiotic treatment of community-acquired pneumonia: rationale of a cluster-randomised cross-over study design According to Dutch guidelines, empirical treatment for patients with Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) requiring hospitalisation but not ICU admission, consists of either monotherapy with a beta-lactam, beta-lactam and macrolide combination therapy or quinolone monotherapy. However, the scientific evidence for each of these strategies is conflicting. Well designed prospective studies are, therefore, necessary. Observational studies are hampered by bias by indication as the choice of therapy may be influenced by different determinants, such as severity of disease or the patients' overall prognosis. As a result, younger patients are more frequently treated with antibiotics with atypical coverage compared to older patients. Although it is -theoreticallypossible to adjust for these differences in multivariate analysis, many determinants may be hidden which will result in (residual) confounding. Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) avoid bias by indication, but may suffer from information bias. Individual randomisation in RCT's requires written informed consent from participating patients. Therefore, in most RCT's, patients have already started with antibiotic treatment before consent is obtained. As the initial antibiotic may differ from the antibiotic after randomization, and since initial treatment is crucial for outcome, such a design may severely compromise an accurate evaluation. Given the drawbacks of these designs, we have designed a multi centre cluster-randomized cross-over study to evaluate the (cost-) effectiveness of three antibiotic treatment strategies (beta-lactam monotherapy, betalactam and macrolide combination therapy or fluorchinolon monotherapy). All patients admitted with (suspicion of) CAP on general wards in 8-10 Dutch hospitals are eligible for inclusion. Each hospital uses one of the three treatment arms as standard empirical therapy during a period of four consecutive months, after which preferred treatment will rotate to one of the other two regimens. The order of change is randomised per hospital, thereby controlling for inter-hospital variables and minimizing seasonal influences. The primary endpoint is day-90 mortality. The results will be analysed in a per-protocol (with stratification based on CAP severity) as well as an intention-to-treat analysis.",

It is likely to have a tremendous impact on economic burden of the disease, specifically in resource limited settings, in a country like India. Objectives: Findings from a previous hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) study indicated that efficacy of tigecycline (TGC) 50 mg q12h was lower than that of imipenem-cilastatin (IMI), especially in subjects with ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of two higher TGC dosage regimens with an IMI regimen in HAP subjects. Methods: In this Phase 2, multicentre, double-blind study, subjects with HAP (stratified VAP and non-VAP) were randomized to one of three treatment arms: TGC 75 mg q12 hour; TGC 100 mg q12 hour; or IMI 1 g q8 hour and received treatment for up to 14 days. The primary and secondary endpoints were the clinical response in clinically evaluable (CE) and clinical modified intent-to-treat (c-mITT) populations at test-of-cure (TOC), respectively. Results: Of 105 subjects who received study drugs, 67 subjects (63.8%) were clinically evaluable. The median age of subjects was 64 years, 68% were male, 39% had VAP, 30% had an APACHE II score >15, 20% were prior antibiotic failures, and median therapy duration was 8 days. Clinical responses are shown in the table below. Eighty-six (82%) subjects reported treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). The most frequently reported TEAEs, gastrointestinal disorders (incidence, 37%) had a numerically higher incidence in the TGC 100 mg group (43%). Serious AEs of sepsis/septic shock were numerically higher in the TGC 75 mg (n = 5) than TGC 100 mg (n = 2) and IMI (n = 2) groups. Seventeen deaths occurred in 7 (19.4%), 3 (8.6%), and 7 (20.6%) subjects who received TGC 75 mg, TGC 100 mg, and IMI respectively.",

Background: XF-73 is a novel porphyrinic antibacterial with demonstrated bactericidal activity in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus (SA) with a low potential for inducing mutational resistance. Two Phase I studies, conducted in two study sites, have evaluated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and anti-staphylococcal activity, of XF-73 intranasal gel, in multiple ascending doses. Methods: Subjects were healthy adults confirmed to be nasal carriers of SA. Safety assessments included haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, ECG, vital signs and nasal examinations. XF-73 or placebo was administered to the anterior nares two or three times daily, for 5 days. Anti-staphylococcal activity was assessed throughout and after treatment by nasal swabs and subsequent culture. Results: Sixty Eight subjects received XF-73 (25 female, 43 male); nine subjects received placebo as control. Five XF-73 concentrations were tested; 0.125-2.0 mg/g, applied for 5 days, two or three times a day. Treatment was well tolerated at all doses. Mild and short lived nasal AEs were reported by 21 (31%) subjects in XF-73 groups, typically mild, transient changes in sensation lasting between 10 hours and 1 day. None of these AEs had any consequence for XF-73 administration or were assessed as clinically significance. Nasal examinations following dosing did not reveal any drug related signs, such as increased secretions or erythema. There were no significant changes in laboratory parameters, ECG or vital signs. PK assessments were all below the detection limit for XF-73, indicating no detectable systemic absorption. Meaningful reductions in SA colonisation were evident at XF-73 concentrations of 0.25, 0.5 and 2.0 mg/g. In a subset of 24 heavily colonized individuals (semi-quantitative culture) at 0.5 (n = 16) and 2.0 mg/g (n = 8), all (100%) registered a reduction in SA load; at the end of treatment SA carriage was absent in 14 (58%), scant in 8 (33%), reduced to a moderate in 2 (9%). Conclusions: Repeated intranasal administration of XF-73 over 5 days is well tolerated at concentrations up to 2.0 mg/g b.d. and there are good preliminary indications of anti-staphylococcal activity to justify further investigation. Propionibacterium acnes is a Gram-positive aerotolerant anaerobe that is found predominately on the skin where it forms part of the resident microbiota. It represents the major opportunistic pathogen within the ''cutaneous'' group of propionibacteria and has been linked, sometimes controversially, to a range of infections and conditions. Historically, the role of P. acnes in certain infections has almost certainly been underestimated due to diagnostic protocols that have poor sensitivity for the detection of the bacterium combined with dismissal as a contaminant when it is recovered. Today, data emerging from P. acnes whole genome sequencing projects, phylogenetic and genetic population analyses, and studies at the transcriptome and proteome level are challenging our understanding of this bacterium and its capacity to cause disease. In particular, isolates from the four genetic divisions (IA, IB, II and III) of P. acnes differ with regard to inflammatory potential and the production of specific virulence determinants, including proteins with phase/ antigenic variation signatures, CAMP factor homologues, haemolysins, and lipase. Recent studies have found a very clear association between isolates from the type IA division, including a globally dispersed clonal lineage, and acne vulgaris. In contrast, isolates from the type IB, II and III divisions are rarely associated with this condition, although they appear to be more frequently recovered from soft tissue and medical implant-related infections. In addition to a discussion of P. acnes epidemiology in relation to acne, we will consider recent data from studies investigating a possible link between P. acnes infection of the prostate gland and prostate cancer development, and review the growing body of evidence that supports P. acnes as an important pathogen in relation to biofilm infections of prosthetic joints.",

The Gram-positive bacterium Propionibacterium acnes is ubiquitously found on the skin, where it resides within sebaceous follicles of the face and back. The presence of P. acnes is thought to be beneficial, e.g. protecting against colonization by harmful microorganisms. However, emerging evidence suggests that P. acnes can act as an opportunistic pathogen in a number of inflammatory diseases. Above all, the bacterium is well known for its association with acne vulgaris, the most common skin disease, which affects up to 80% of all adolescents. However, despite decades of research, the exact role of the bacterium in acne remains an enigma. Recent research has highlighted the potential importance of P. acnes strain identity for determining disease outcome of colonization. This assumption is based on the fact that there are disparities between acne isolates and strains isolated from healthy individuals. Moreover, strain identity seems to have a major impact on host tissue adhesion and inflammatory potential of P. acnes. We decided to apply comparative genome and transcriptome analysis to pinpoint the major differences between ''commensal'' and ''diseaseassociated'' strains of P. acnes. Our data highlight the presence of genomic regions and islands and their possible contributions to pathogenicity. Targeting strain-specific P. acnes factors is a novel therapeutic strategy to cure acne and other P. acnes -associated diseases, with the added advantage of minimal disturbance to the fragile balance of our skin microbiota. In a second study, we applied a microarray-based approach to compare host cell responses to P. acnes, thereby using different tissue-derived cell types. We found that infection scenarios differed drastically between cell types in terms of the triggered cellular signaling events. Our data also suggests that host-tissue tropism, in part, determines P. acnes invasion, inflammatory capacity and persistency of infection; this could contribute to severe P. acnes pathologies at non-skin infection sites.",

This fusion has caused an additional six amino acids to be added to the N-terminus of the pre-protein which explains its recently described ragged N-terminus by changing cleavage sites and also the membrane targeting of NDM-1. This fusion may have happened by two routes. Firstly a deletion event between an upstream aphA6 composite transposon could have occurred removing sequence upstream of the start codon and the majority of the aphA6 gene or secondly, this structure could have been constructed by an ISCR16-like element which initially captured blaNDM-1 and then moved it into the NDM-1 -a growing problem aphA6 gene. Analysis of sequence adjacent to the oriIS of the ISCR16/ blaNDM-1 structures in both Acinetobacter and other species indicate that it has inserted in a region with a similar GC% to A. baumanii adding evidence to such an hypothesis. The construction of blaNDM-1 by this fusion event has also given blaNDM-1 new promoter sequences by a natural genetic engineering event which may be linked to its recent success. The identical sequence upstream blaNDM-1 and aphA6 genes indicates that the fusion is recent, in line with current knowledge of NDM-1 emergence.",

All but one NDM plasmids of the five donor strains could be transferred by conjugation. The conjugation rates of InA/C NDM plasmids from K. pneumoniae and E. coli were 9.0 \u00b7 10^4 and 1.4 \u00b7 10^4 transconjugants per recipient, respectively. We also observed a synergistic effect of meropenem and ceftazidime combinations with sodium azide mitigating NDM producing transconjugant growth. The inclusion of sub-MIC ciprofloxacin into the environment in vitro enhanced the conjugation rate by~40 times for NDM plasmid. Conjugation can alter the tra operon which may lead to defective conjugation machinery within transconjugants. Conclusion: The spread of the NDM plasmid can occur at an astounding rate through the process of conjugation. This process can be enhanced by introduction of ciprofloxacin into the environment before conjugation to either stimulate plasmid transfer or increase the frequency. Furthermore, the plasmid can become modified during the conjugation process to generate an alternative sized plasmid or multiple plasmids which can potentially enhance the spread of the NDM gene.",

The blaNDM-1 gene was localized in a multidrug resistance (MDR) region of 20 181 bp. This region was bracketed by two copies of insertion seqeunce IS26 in opposite orientations, creating an IS26-made composite transposon. In order to get further insights into the blaNDM-1 gene successful dissemination, a comparison of the genetic structures previously identified with that identified in plasmid pGUE was performed. It appeared that a common module was always identified. This module was composed of the ISAba125 fragment containing the -35 promoter region, the blaNDM-1 gene, the bleomycin resistance gene, and a truncated phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase. Conclusion: Our study characterized an IncFII plasmid which backbone is known to be successful considering that it currently represents the major vehicle for dissemination of the blaCTX-M-15 gene. The functional part of the scaffold corresponded to that of other identified IncF plasmids. The originality was linked to the way the blaNDM-1 containing module had been acquired, resulting from a series of recombination events involving insertion sequence IS26.",

Hospital sewage is an important but often overlooked reservoir of antimicrobial resistance determinants and warrants more attentions. The aphA6-ISAba125-blaNDM-1 structure was likely due to recombination between two copies of ISAba125. This suggests that ISAba125 could serve as a hot spot for homologous recombination, generating variations in genetic contexts of blaNDM-1. Background: CMV-recipients receiving a graft from a Cytomegalovirus (CMV)+ donor (R-D+) are at high risk of developing CMV infection or disease. Universal prophylaxis, for at least 3 months, is the preferred option but there are still doubts about the best strategy to use in these patients (pt). Methods: Kidney and liver R-D+ pt from the RESITRA cohort (Transplantation Infections Spanish Network Study) were analysed. Development of CMV infection or disease according to the prophylaxis received was studied. Results: One hundred and ninty five out of 2410 kidney or liver transplant pt were R-D+ for CMV. 33 (17%) R-D+ pt developed CMV disease, of which 14 (42%) were late-onset diseases. Universal prophylaxis during 3 months was administered to 126 pt (65%). Eighteen (14%) of these pt developed CMV infection, 13 (10%) of them also developed CMV disease. Among 69 pt who did not receive universal prophylaxis, 31 (45%) developed CMV infection and 20 (29%) of them, also developed CMV disease. Focus on these 20 pt who did not receive universal prophylaxis and developed CMV disease, 16 out of 20 pt developed CMV disease directly without observed CMV replication previous CMV disease development and therefore without the possibility of an early pre-emptive therapy. Among 11 pt who developed CMV infection without CMV disease they had received a pre-emptive therapy. Mean time to CMV infection in pt receiving and not receiving universal prophylaxis was 142 and 78 days, respectively. There was a trend towards developing late CMV disease in the universal prophylaxis group (p < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, not receiving universal prophylaxis (OR 5.9, 95% CI 2.8-12.6), the presence of rejection requiring steroids (OR 3.4, 95% CI: 1.2-9.1), and receiving a kidney transplant compared with liver transplant (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2-9.2) were independent factors associated with increased risk of CMV infection. On the other hand, not receiving universal prophylaxis (OR 4, 3, 95% CI 1, 9) , and receiving a kidney transplant compared with liver transplant (OR 1,5, 95% CI 1,1-1,9) were independent factors associated with increased risk of CMV disease.",

Ulcerative colitis, older age and corticosteroid resistance are risk markers for developing this complication in IBD patients with a flare. Immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine and infliximab is also a risk factor in patients with previously-diagnosed IBD. Phage Therapy was proposed as a therapeutic treatment against bacterial infections almost a century ago by Felix d'Herelle, about 10 years before the discovery of penicillin. Despite a rapid world diffusion of this therapy, the lack of scientific knowledge on bacteriophages/bacteria relationships and the discovery of antibiotics precipitated its abandon except, mainly, in East European countries. While antibiotics became a routine therapy in the second half of the last century, the scientific knowledge on bacteriophages led to the birth of molecular biology. Today the increasingly public health problems caused by antibioticresistant bacteria are a major driving force in the renewed interest in phage therapy. Together with the re-discovery that bacteriophages were used to treat bacterial infections in humans for years in some East European countries, recent works performed with animal models highlight the potential of the use of bacteriophages in medicine.",

            "text": "In the past few years, we have shown using mice that bacteriophages can be used to treat acute lung infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This work, performed on two different P. aeruginosa strains with two different bacteriophages, was later extended to the demonstration that bacteriophages could also be used to prevent and protect mice from lethal lung infection up to 4 days. These investigations led us to the identification of two new groups of bacteriophages. More recently we investigated the relationships between bacteriophages and the intestinal flora. We first showed that bacteriophages were able to infect bacteria growing on biofilms formed in vitro and ex vivo. Second, using a mouse model colonized with an enteroaggregative O104:H4 Escherichia coli strain, we demonstrated that bacteriophages can replicate continuously over several weeks. Upon addition of an initial high dose of bacteriophages we could show that the ileal concentration of the E. coli strain was strongly reduced. However, this strain could not be totally cleared from the gut. In the light of these two examples, phage therapy is getting closer to reality and does not anymore resemble to a myth, even if numerous questions have still not yet found answers. Despite reductions in disease attributable to widespread use of proteinconjugate polysaccharide vaccines (PCV), the pneumococcus retains its role as a principal pathogen of the respiratory tract, causing many or most cases of otitis media, acute sinusitis, and pneumonia and occasional exacerbations of chronic lung disease. Diseases outside the respiratory tract include bacteremia with no recognized focus, meningitis, septic arthritis, endocarditis, peritonitis and osteomyelitis. The complex polysaccharide capsule repels ingestion and killing by innate immune mechanisms or by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Peptidoglycan, the principal constituent of cell wall, and pneumolysin each stimulate an intense inflammatory response. Disease of the respiratory tract results when the host fails to clear organisms and inflammatory products accumulate. Treatment of extra-CNS infection has remained straightforward, with most pneumococci remaining susceptible to betalactam antibiotics in commonly used doses and to fluoroquinolones. Even meningitis, in most cases, responds to commonly recommended high doses of third-generation cephalosporins. Some newer antibiotics such as ceftaroline appear to be effective against penicillin-resistant organisms. Widespread use of 7-valent PCV has led to emergence of replacement strains, and use of 13-valent PCV is almost certain to have the same effect, limiting the usefulness of any polysaccharide-based vaccine in the future. Pneumolysin, a major virulence factor of pneumococci, and proteins that are expressed on the surface are currently under investigation as potential vaccine components.",

Since 2008, a trend to involvement of northern areas in Veneto Region was observed, and, in 2011, most cases were identified in areas that were not affected in the previous years. WNV NAT screening of blood, tissue, and organ donation identified four WNV RNA-positive blood donors and one WNV RNA-positive organ donor, who were resident in the same areas where symptomatic human cases were identified. A WNV-positive organ donor was missed by NAT testing and transmitted infection to three out of five recipients, two of whom (the kidney recipients) developed WNND and excreted WNV RNA in their urine. Rapid detection of these cases allowed prevention of further transmissions to other tissue recipients. Following this experience, we monitored WNV RNA in the urine of WNV NAT-positive blood donors. In these subjects, WNV RNA remained positive in urine long after becoming undetectable in peripheral blood. Whole genome sequencing of two human WNV strains isolated in Veneto Region in 2011 demonstrated that they were WNV lineage 1, clade 1a, and phylogenetically related to WNV strains circulating in Italy and in the Western Mediterranean basin in the previous years. About 1% divergence was observed between the genome of the WNV strains isolated in 2011 and the strain isolated in 2009 in Veneto Region. Conclusions: For the forth consecutive year, in 2011, human cases of WNV disease occurred in Veneto Region. In affected regions, WNV NAT screening of blood and organ donations detected a relatively high rate of positive cases. WNV RNA detection in urine represented a sensitive test. Genetic comparison of WNV strains isolated in Italy in the recent years indicated that the virus might been re-introduced by migratory birds several times and than it might have circulated and evolved. Conclusions: A comparison of data during these outbreaks indicates a shift from mild illness towards a larger and more severe manifestation of the disease, which could be interpreted as an epidemiologic transition pattern in Lahore and other regions of the country.Serologic and virologic conditions are now highly indicative of a further locally acquired outbreak of DHF of a larger magnitude in the future. This highlights the need for rigorous vector control measures and vaccine development. Continuing education of clinicians and primary care physicians is crucial for early recognition of DHF, especially in patients with a prior history of DF. Several studies have demonstrated that Toscana virus (TOSV) was a prominent cause of CNS infections and febrile illness in Mediterranean countries, and more specifically in southern France. However, there is still little data reflecting the circulation of TOSV in the general population; a previous study conducted on 92 sera from blood donors reported that approximately 12% possessed IgG specific of Toscana virus, suggesting previous infection (de Lamballerie et al. 2007) . A recent study conducted in blood donors found prevalence of the same order of magnitude (Brisbarre et al. 2011) . However, the small number of samples precluded to investigate the distribution according to the age. A total of 387 sera which were collected in patients admitted and/or hospitalized in the Public Hospitals of Marseille and for which Toscana virus serology was prescribed were included in the study. These sera had been collected from 2004 to 2011. Approximately 12% of the general population has been in contact with TOSV demonstrating a very active circulation.",

Background: Respiratory infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Novel respiratory viruses, such as human coronaviruses (HCoV), bocaviruses, and human metapneumovirus, are recognized as common causes of respiratory disease. HCoV drew the attention of the scientific community after the identification of SARScoronavirus in 2003. Since then, at least two additional coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63; HCoV-HKU1) associated with human illness have been discovered. No reports exist in the literature describing the existence of these viruses in Peru. Methods: Respiratory samples were collected from influenza like illness (ILI) cases who are participating in a population-based respiratory surveillance study in Peru. This study, initiated in June 2009, follows approximately 7000 participants, from 1500 households living in four geographically distinct locations across Peru: Lima (central coast/ urban), Tumbes (tropical coast/rural), Cusco (highlands/semi-rural), Puerto Maldonado (Amazon rainforest/urban). Samples were tested by real-time RT-PCR for influenza A and B. A sub-group of 173 samples, negative for influenza was selected to perform additional testing for additional respiratory viruses using a multiplex Luminex RVP assay. Results: Of the 173 samples, 11 (6.4%) were positive for HCoV, 8 (4.6%) for HCoV-HKU1, 2 (1.2%) for HCoV-NL63, 1 (0.6%) for HCoV-229E. None were positive for HCoV-OC43. The majority of the cases were male, under the age of 5to (7/11; 64%).), One participant was 7 months old, while three were adults (31, 32 and 59 years old). Participants with HCoV infections started their ILI disease episodes between mid April and mid December; however 9/11 participants started their disease between mid May and July, the winter season in Peru. HCoV cases were observed from all four sites, three from Lima, four from Cusco and two each from Puerto Maldonado and Tumbes. Discussion: To our knowledge this is the first report of HCoV infection in humans from Peru. The prevalence in our study is similar to previous reports. A clear seasonality for HCoVs was also found. HCoV infections were from four sites in Peru, suggest that HCoVs circulate in urban and rural areas in Peru. HKU1 infections were most common in our populations, which is in contrast to other studies where viruses such as HCoV-OC43 are most prevalent. We only found positive samples in 2010; this could be explained by a biennial behavior as previously reported. Objectives: Alert and surveillance are major issues in the field of infectious diseases (ID) and several examples during past decades have highlighted that warning systems can reveal major pathogen and outbreaks. A weekly monitoring of microbiologic data that involves both syndromic and targeted surveillance has been implemented since 2002 in Marseille University Hospitals (UH) using EPIMIC, an in house computer program. Methods: EPIMIC uses Microsoft Excel software and analyses weekly numbers of clinical samples send for microbiological diagnosis to core/ point-of-care laboratories of Marseille UH and the weekly numbers of positive testing. Surveillance is (i) primarily syndrome-based, using the nature of the samples regardless of pathogens sought, and (ii) secondarily focused on pathogens including those critical in terms of mortality or implication in nosocomial infections and antimicrobial resistance. EPIMIC calculates for each set of data the mean value and standard deviation (SD) and new data are compared instantly to historical ones. Any significant increase beyond the mean value +2 SD, generates a red color signal. All data are plotted in graphics.",

New parameters have been gradually added, and the mean duration of surveillance is 4.6 years (range, 2 months-8.4 years). Beside monitoring infections/pathogens with known seasonality, EPIMIC proved efficient by the detection of several abnormal/previously unknown events including notably: (i) an increased incidence of Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infections during summer; (ii) a low incidence of influenza infections in 2010; (iii) an increase in 01/2011-02/2011 of pharyngitis with group A Streptococcus (GAS) and association of GAS invasive infections with Influenza; (iv) an increase in 02/2011 of imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii; and (v) an increase of hepatitis E cases during first trimester 2011. Conclusion: EPIMIC is a home-made, simple and versatile program that has proven efficient to detect abnormal events related to ID, which is well suited to their unpredictability. Future improvements may include optimization of critical threshold for alert, specific monitoring for some clinical units, and automation of data transfer from lab computer systems.",

A matrix degrading phenotype in TB results in tissue damage, where the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is unopposed by their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs). We investigated factors regulating neutrophil MMP secretion in TB in vitro and in patients. Methods: Neutrophils from healthy volunteers were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) or stimulated with conditioned media from Mtb-infected monocytes (CoMTB). Analysis of MMP-8/-9 secretion and TIMP-1/-2 was by ELISA, Luminex array and zymography. Gene expression of MMP-8/9 was investigated using real-time PCR. Neutrophil granule formation was assessed by confocal microscopy. Induced sputum samples from 137 healthy controls and TB patients were analysed. Brain biopsies from patients with central nervous system-TB were studied by immunohistochemistry. Results: Neutrophil MMP-8/-9 secretion is upregulated by Mtb over time and is dependent on TB multiplicity of infection. CoMTB stimulated neutrophils resulted in a 2 and 3 fold up-regulation of MMP-8/-9 secretion respectively (both p < 0.001). TIMP-2 is increased 2-fold (p < 0.001) but not TIMP-1. MMP-8 and -9 is increased 16 and 160 fold respectively compared to TIMP-2. MMP-8/-9 gene expression was increased 3.5 fold and 7 fold respectively by CoMTB stimulation at 24 hours (both p < 0.001). Confocal microscopy demonstrated colocalisation of early endosome marker Rab-5 with MMP-8 and -9 indicating that MMP-8/-9 are newly synthesised. MMP-8/-9 is significantly elevated in induced sputum samples from TB patients compared to healthy controls and both correlate with the neutrophil markers neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin and myeloperoxidase. Brain biopsy specimens from patients with CNS-TB demonstrated neutrophils surrounding TB granulomas with MMP-8 and -9 present. Conclusions: Neutrophil MMP-8/-9 gene expression and secretion is upregulated following direct infection with TB or stimulation by monocyte-dependent TB networks. The increase in MMP/TIMP ratio will result in a proteolytic environment which may lead to patient morbidity associated with tissue destruction. Introduction: Tuberculosis (TB) is characterised by extensive tissue destruction, causing mortality, morbidity and mycobacterial spread. The greatest burden of disease lies in Southern Africa and has been fuelled by the HIV epidemic. In HIV co-infection, TB causes divergent pathology, with markedly reduced inflammatory host damage evident in advanced immunocompromise. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), key proteases in extracellular matrix remodelling, are implicated in TB tissue destruction, but little is known about their role in TB-HIV coinfection.",

Objectives: To examine the respiratory burst of both monocytes and polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) and to determine the monocyte antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Methods: Patients presenting with compatible symptoms, relevant imaging, positive tuberculous cultures and suggestive histological tissue with diagnosis of tuberculosis were consecutively enrolled in the study. The patients were compared with age and sex matched healthy volunteers. Demographic data and clinical features of the patients were documented on a designed form. The isolated PMNs and isolated monocyte respiratory bursts were studied by stimulation with phorbol myristate (PMA) with the measurement of chemiluminescence (CL) responses. ADCC of isolated monocytes was determined utilizing the turbidimetric measurement of nucleated target cell suspension at 630nm. Results: Thirteen patients with culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis and six patients with extra-pulmonary were consecutively enrolled in the study. They were made up of 13 males and six females with mean age \u00b1SD of 40 \u00b1 3.2 years. The patients were compared with age and sex matched nineteen healthy volunteers.

Five selected MAP genes were fused to the pNZ8048 expression vector to create transcriptional fusions for controlled expression utilizing the Nisin Inducible Controlled Expression (NICE) system. Subsequently, these fusion vectors (pNZ8048:MAP+) were transformed into Lb. salivarius and induced at mid-log phase with 0.2% v/v nisin for 4 h statically at 37\u00b0C. mRNA isolation and RT-PCR analysis (Roche Lightcycler480) were used to confirm the expression of MAP genes within the host strain. Levels of nisin dose-dependant control over expression were also examined. Protein analysis was carried out using SDS PAGE and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The controlled over-expression of MAP proteins/antigens from a GRAS (Generally Regarded as Safe) host has numerous therapeutic applications.

OXA-48 beta-lactamase was initially identified in Turkey, but there have been scattered reports, mainly in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, from several countries in the Middle-East and the Mediterranean region, especially north Africa. Hospital outbreaks caused by producers of this carbapenemase have been described in Turkey and more recently in several European countries. K. pneumoniae strains of sequence type 395 have been implicated in the European spread of OXA-48 carbapenemase, although the resistance gene has been detected in many clones and, indeed, other genera. The blaOXA-48 gene is usually located on transposon Tn1999, which has been found in OXA-48-positive Enterobacteriaceae of diverse geographic origin on highly-related conjugative plasmids of c. 62-kb. A recently described variant, OXA-181 carbapenemase, differs from OXA-48 by just four amino acids, but its gene is associated with an ISEcp1 element on a distinct transposon, Tn2013, and on much smaller plasmids of c. 7-kb. Accurate detection of these enzymes in Enterobacteriaceae may pose problems for diagnostic and reference laboratories unless confirmatory molecular tests are used; many producers remain susceptible in vitro to imipenem and/or meropenem and, in the absence of other resistance mechanisms such as ESBLs, also to oxyimino-cephalosporins. Highlevel resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam and temocillin may be useful markers for OXA-48-like enzymes in strains that show reduced carbapenem susceptibility. International studies are needed to monitor spread of OXA-48 and other carbapenemases. Results: In 2010 the mandatory MRSA bacteraemia surveillance recorded 1630 MRSA bacteraemia cases in England, giving a rate of 3.12 cases per 100 000 population with MRSA accounting for 15% of all S. aureus bacteraemias. This is in contrast to the situation merely 4 year previously, where the same surveillance programme reported 6771 MRSA cases giving a rate over four fold higher than in 2010, at 13.33 cases per 100 000 population and 38% of S. aureus bacteraemias being MRSA. This represents a c. 76% reduction in MRSA in 4 years. The low 2010 MRSA rate coincided with 16 (9.5%) NHS Trusts recording no Trust apportioned MRSA bacteraemia cases i.e. cases discovered on or after the third day post hospital admission.",

Furthermore, to calculate species specific rates of nosocomial BSI, and to compare drug resistance patterns for selected hospital and community acquired infections. Methods: All patients with a positive blood culture at Lillebaelt Hospital during 2008-2011 were included in the study. An episode of BSI was defined as a positive blood culture with a significant pathogen and concomitantly treatment of the patient with antibiotics. A new episode of BSI was defined as a new culture of the same microorganism after 1 week or later or as growth of another pathogen two days or more after a previous positive blood culture. Nosocomial infections (HAI) were defined as positive blood cultures obtained more than two days after hospital admission. Information on microbiological findings and admission data was compiled from electronic registries in the Hospital.",

The distribution of Gram-positive and negative strains, yeast and anaerobic bacteria was 53%, 43%, 3%, and 1%, respectively. Nosocomial infections comprised 22% of all BSI detected during the study. However, the proportion of HAI was <6% for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Group A and B betahemolytic streptococci, whereas more than 60% of the episodes with Candida species, Enterococcus faecium, and Serratia marcescens were of nosocomial origin. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were most commonly isolated; 20% and 11% were HAI, respectively. MRSA caused 4% of HAI with S. aureus and none of the community acquired BSI (CAI). Percentage of penicillin-resistance was 77% and 74%, respectively. E. coli with ESBL were seen in 6% of HAI and 4% of CAI. Surprisingly, resistance to ampicillin, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin was highest in E. coli BSI episodes of CAI origin. Rates of BSI for selected species are presented, e.g., the E. coli nosocomial BSI rates for Department of Oncology were 0.12, 0.15, 0.27, and 0.51 per 1000 bed days in 2008-2011. Conclusion: Computer-assisted surveillance of hospital and community acquired blood stream infections, and the corresponding drug resistance patterns of relevance for empiric treatment of patients should be implemented at a hospital. Incidence rates of selected nosocomial BSI may assist in evaluation of infection control measures. Background: Infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae are a major concern to public health. OXA-48 is an emerging carbapenemase, especially in the Mediterranean basin. Patients and Methods: An observational prospective study was conducted in the setting of an outbreak at a 1328-bed university hospital in Madrid, Spain. All adult patients with OXA-48 positive blood cultures between July 2010 and November 2011 were included. OXA-48 genes were searched by PCR.",

            "text": "Results: Twenty six patients (65% men) with bacteremia caused by an OXA-48 producing bacteria, were included (21 K. pneumoniae, 4 E. coli and 1 K. oxytoca). MIC50 for Ertapenem was >32 mcg/mL, for Imipenem 4 mcg/mL and for Meropenem was 2 mcg/mL. Median age was 73 (41 to 92) and median Charlson Index was 5 (0-12). All were nosocomial except three that were health-care related, no communityacquired episodes were observed. Median time from hospital admission to positive blood cultures was 29 days (0-167). Up to 18 patients had surgery during the admission. 4 patients had urinary catether, two central venous catheters and five had both at the time of bacteremia. Median antibiotic DDD received before bacteremia was 47 and carbapenem DDD was 23. The source of the infection was intrabdominal in 8/26 patients (31%), urinary in 7/26 (27%), catheterrelated in 3/26 (11%), primary bacteremia 4/26(15%) and others 4/ 26(15%). Regarding severity of presentation, median Pitt Score was 2 (0-11). Eighteen patients received active antimicrobial therapy against the isolate. The most used antibiotic were: tigecycline, amikacin, fosfomycin and colistin, in any combination. Median delay between the date of isolation and the start of an appropriate antimicrobial therapy (MIC sensitive) was 3 days (0-8) and for an adequate treatment (right dose and route of administration) was 7 days (0-8). 18 patients died during admission (69%), 11 treated and seven non-treated. Relationship between bacteremia and death was direct in 10 cases, not related in seven, and unknown in 1.Median time from blood cultures to death was 13 days (0-128). Among those who survived, median time from blood cultures to discharge was 40 days (11-87). Conclusions: BSI caused by OXA-48 produccing enterobacteria are associated with an ominous prognosis, this could be related with dificulties in identification, limited therapeutic options and toxicity of available treatments. Efforts should be made to identify outbreaks and to adopt appropriate measures to control nosocomial spread. (Figure 1) . Over time the male excess has remained fairly constant but with variation by age group. Where reported, the main sources of MRSA and MSSA bacteraemia were lines (36% & 28% respectively) and skin and soft tissue infections (28% & 30% respectively), with much variation by meticillin-resistance, gender and age group. Amongst those aged < 1year lines predominated for both genders (60-70%). Urinary tract infections (UTIs) were more common amongst males compared to females (MRSA 15% vs. 5% [p = 0.0011]; MSSA 9% vs. 5% [p = 0.154]) however this variation was minimal in the <1 year group and most apparent in the 75 + group.",

The source of bacteraemia may be driving the gender and age specific trends observed but further analysis is required. Objectives: Obtaining data on trends in the incidence of central lineassociated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) in the population of a large teaching institution is difficult, because days of catheter exposure/ patient is usually measured in the intensive care unit (ICU) only. An alternative could be monitoring catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) confirmed in the microbiology department. We evaluated recent trends in the incidence and aetiology of CRBSI in a large teaching institution and their correspondence with CLABSI. Methods: We assessed the incidence and aetiology of CRBSI (synchronous presence of the same microorganism in blood culture and in a significant semiquantitative count in the catheter tip) during an 8-year period (2003-2010) by comparing adult ICUs that implemented care bundles with other hospital departments. Results: We recorded 479 710 admissions, 14 713 episodes of BSI (30.67 episodes/1000 admissions) and 1208 episodes (8.2%) of CRBSI. The incidence of CRBSI ranged from 1.9 to 3.6 episodes/1000 admissions, with a mean of 2.5 episodes/1000 admissions. No significant overall reductions in the incidence of CRBSI were detected (p = 0.6). However, after adjusting for the number of blood cultures drawn, we observed a significant 47% reduction (95% CI: 17-66%; p = 0.005) in the incidence rate in adult ICUs, where care bundles had been applied. This trend was similar for both CLABSI and CRBSI.",

The effect of obesity varied according to surgical category with large bowel surgery being most affected by patients' BMI (obese vs. not obese OR = 2.03, p < 0.001) and abdominal hysterectomy being least affected (obese vs. not obese OR = 1.83, p = 0.085). Conclusion: Being overweight or obese substantially increases the risk of SSI. Given the increasing prevalence of obesity in England, it is likely that BMI will increasingly contribute to the overall risk of a patient developing an SSI. This has implications for the management of obese surgical patients. The effect of increased BMI has implications for antimicrobial prophylaxis and for patients' glycaemic control and suggests areas for further clinical research.",

Automated culture systems, mass spectrometry and DNA based diagnosis have drastically reduced the time needed for pathogen identification in clinical specimens. However, recent studies on rapid bacterial identification of MSRA in blood culture failed to show a clinical impact, when not coupled with an immediate communication of results to the on-ward clinician by either an infectious diseases specialist or a pharmacist. Clearly, rapid microbial identification is most useful if it reaches the clinician in charge immediately and is interpreted correctly. Ideally, an ID specialist could be used to make the link between the lab and the clinician in charge 24/7 for the most relevant specimen. However, what is possible within the funding of clinical studies may not be in real life. IT solutions could provide an alternative approach. Nowadays, most physicians are familiar with handheld devices used at the bedside to check creatinin clearance, drug interactions and so on. The on-ward physician could expect in the near future to receive messages on his ward cell phone such as: ''Mister X, positive blood culture (four vials) with Gram negative rods, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. This bacterium is naturally resistant to carbapenems and aminoglycosides''. If the hospital already uses an electronic antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) program, the latter could even add: ''Your patient is actually treated by imipenem. Consider empiric use of co-trimoxazol plus ceftazidime''. In institutions using an antibiotic guide, the latter could be electronically linked with the microbiological results (hyperlink). Rapid microbiological diagnosis linked with advanced IT solutions has the potential to positively improve time to adequate treatment of our patients, as well as infection control. However, there are still many questions to resolve. How to identify the physician that is actually at bedside? How to ensure that the ''live'' information is strictly limited to what is most critical for the clinician? How to avoid inappropriate interpretation of lab results? There lies the ''talon d'Achille'' of advanced IT solutions such as electronic AMS programs linked with microbiological results.",

We are in the process of implementing full microbiology laboratory automation to provide timely information relevant for patient care. So far, the majority of processes are controlled by a laboratory information system (LIS) that is also transmitting the results to the hospital information system (HIS). At present, urgent results, such as the identification of bacteria causing bloodstream infections or the antimicrobial susceptibility data of multiresistant pathogens are communicated via phone by clinical microbiologists, which also regularly participate on clinical rounds to discuss critical patients. However, the mere number of hospitals and there geographic distribution makes direct communication ever more difficult. We are, hence, forced to apply new information technology to collect clinical data required both for prioritizing tests and for interpreting test results. This requires an intelligent, versatile and open middle ware that not only controls the lab organization but also communicates with existing laboratory or clinical information systems without compromising data safety and security or strangling the capacity of exiting IT divisions. The use of smartphones or other personal digital assistants over wireless broadband or 3G networks represents a promising way for real-time clinical alerts with or without decision support both for antimicrobial therapy or hospital hygiene. Implementation of mobile communication platforms may significantly improve the management of infectious diseases thus preventing further development and spread of antimicrobial resistance.",

            "text": "Today, most laboratories have their in vitro diagnostic devices connected to their information management system, either directly or via an intermediate system steering the work of a set of devices, exchanging the work orders and their corresponding results up and down the stream. This connectivity of the IVD devices to the laboratory information system is achieved for all specialties, microbiology included. It enables the clinical laboratory to streamline its internal processes while improving the level of quality of those processes, thus contributing to meet the requirements of overall quality management standards such as ISO 15189. However, this connectivity is often still relying on non-standard communication protocols as well as on locally agreed coded vocabularies to identify objects such as the types of specimens, the analytes, the microorganism or the antibiotics. This results in a high cost of deployment and maintenance of these interfaces, for both the vendors and the users. Moreover, this lack of standardized protocols and coded vocabularies weighs on the laboratory capability to communicate its results to the stakeholders surrounding it: The information systems of clinicians waiting for the laboratory reports, the shared electronic health records operated by the region or country to improve continuity and coordination of care, and the public health repositories, who need to track and consolidate knowledge on the ongoing status of infections on broader territories, such as Europe with ESCMID for example. A better handling of these laboratory results and especially microbiology results can only occur with an end-to-end connectivity relying on stable standards and consistent vocabularies, used in the same way by all systems potentially dealing with such laboratory results. The international organization Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) is contributing to this goal of end-to-end connectivity, by providing a consistent set of profiles of standards in the IHE Laboratory domain, covering the various use cases of laboratory information exchange. Recently this set of profiles has been complemented with the help of another international organization -the IVD Industry Connectivity Consortium (IICC). This 2 years joined effort of IHE and IICC has produced a new profile called ''Laboratory Analytical Workflow''.",

            "text": "Isolation as a mean to control the spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms is subject to controversy. Isolation makes sense if a bacteria is efficaciously transmitted by direct contact, and patients (or their surrounding surfaces) harbouring them are important reservoirs. In a recent systematic review of published articles, multifaceted strategies including contact precautions and isolation has been shown to be associated with increased probability of controlling the spread of MDR gram negatives. However, because isolation may be associated with adverse effects, pros and cons should be carefully considered. Many clonal outbreaks of ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in which colonised patients are key reservoirs have been described. Moreover, some clones of K. pneumoniae are well known by their great ability to spread by cross-transmission within healthcare centres. This usual epidemiologic behaviour makes it prudent to recommend isolation for all patients colonised or infected with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. This recommendation may be applied to other species of Klebsiella and Enterobacter. The decision is more difficult in the case of ESBLproducing Escherichia coli. Two arguments can be used to recommend isolation in these cases: the fact that some ESBL-producing E. coli has been shown to spread clonally, and the fact that the mobile genetic elements associated with ESBLs may be cross-transmitted using E. coli or other enterobacteria as a vehicle. However, clonal spread of E. coli actually occurs in the community, and whether acute care centers plays a relevant role in further amplifying the spread is far from clear. Well proven nosocomial outbreaks caused by ESBL-producing E. coli in which cross-transmission is important are scarce and usually affected small numbers of patients. Finally, the prevalence of colonisation with ESBL-producing E. coli in the community in many areas may be too high to feasibly detect and isolate all them. Thus, combining activities aimed at improving hand hygiene and prudent use of antibiotics which select for these organisms (mainly, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones) while carefully tracking all nosocomial cases so that any outbreak can be readily detected is a reasonable alternative to isolation for all pateints harbouring ESBL-producing E. coli. An exception to this might be patients admitted to ICUs, for which isolation may be prudent. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the commonest cause of hospital acquired diarrhoea in adults but the clinical significance of CDI in children is less certain. This talk describes colonisation and infection with CDI in childhood in terms of risk factors, epidemiology and management. A proposed scoring system for assessing the severity of CDI with specific criteria for children is discussed. Proteomics is particularly suitable for characterizing human pathogens with high life cycle complexity, such as fungi. Protein content and expression levels may be affected by growth states and life cycle morphs. Identification and typing of fungi by conventional methods are often difficult, time-consuming and frequently, for unusual species, inconclusive. Moreover, substantial changes in medical, intensive care and organ transplantation practices are drastically increasing emerging therapy-refractory/uncommon fungi. Herein we report on proteomic phenotypes from MALDI-TOF MS employed as analytical and typing expression profiling of yeasts, yeastlike species and strain variants in order to achieve fungal proteomics population studies. MS-based dentifications (IDs) can be successfully compared to reference biochemical-based systems (e.g.,Vitek-2) and corroborated by genotyping IDs, targeting 25-28S rRNA hypervariable D2 regions. MS IDs show a high analytical performance and profiling heterogeneity which complement or even outclass existing yeast typing tools. This variability reflects the high biological complexity of yeasts and may be properly exploited to provide epidemiological tracing and infection dispersion patterns. Furthermore, filamentous and other fungi (e.g., Aspergillus, Emericella, Fusarium, Geosmithia, Neosartorya, Penicillium, Pseudallescheria, Scedosporium, Talaromyces, Fomitopsis) may be correlated to laboratory-adapted reference ''proteomic phenotypes'' which extend the diagnostic powerful of basic databases. Growth time-courses at 30\u00b0C on Sabouraud agar medium define the 120 hour point as the best peptide extraction condition for full recovery of conidia-or asci-producing multihyphal morph structures and the highest intra-and inter-class profiling correlation, allowing engineered derived libraries. MS mould IDs may be referred to genotyping and to routine morphotyping IDs. Fingerprinting classifiers, selected by Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis algorithm, and computed by different algorithms, allow model construction. Proteomic phenotyping is revolutionizing diagnostic mycology as fully reflecting species/morph varieties but often overcoming taxonomic hindrance. If we are to gain further insights into the description of fungi of relevant medical interest, we need to implement customized fingerprinting databases ''ad-hoc'' generated. MALDI-TOF MS proteomic phenotyping boosts patient-tailored identification protocols in diagnostic mycology. Several studies have been performed in which MALDI-TOF MS has been used for the identification of anaerobic bacteria e.g. Prevotella sp., Fusobacterium sp., Clostridium sp., Bacteroides sp. and gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC). In each of these studies MALDI-TOF MS was shown to be superior over conventional identification methods. The importance of an extensive database containing the reference spectra was also shown in these studies. Several of these studies first compiled a database which was subsequently used to identify unknown strains. Strains not identified by MALDI-TOF MS were mostly species of which no reference spectra were present in the database.",

This confirms the importance of an extensive database. At this moment a correct species identification is obtained, when compared to the 16S rRNA gene sequencing, for roughly 60% of the anaerobic bacteria encountered in human clinical specimens. More strains can be identified when the available databases are optimized for the identification of anaerobic bacteria.",

Because MALDI-TOF MS is capable of detecting a broad spectrum of molecules, including structural modifications at the molecular level, the detection of different mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobials may soon become available. Two main approaches can be used for this purpose: (i) the identification of molecular epidemiological markers specific to drug-resistant cells and (ii) the detection of the destruction or modification of antibiotic molecules. The former approach has been used for the detection of methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and for the elucidation of polymyxin resistance in Gram-negative bacteria resulting from structural changes in their lipopolysaccharides. The latter approach was first applied for detecting the modification of beta-lactams by beta-lactamases. Methods for the detection of carbapenemases based on the hydrolysis of meropenem or ertapenem were recently validated. MALDI-TOF MS was able to detect small changes in carbapenem molecules (e.g., sodium salt variant of these antibiotics). Therefore, it can be hypothesised that assays for the detection of modifications of other antibiotic molecules (e.g., aminoglycosides) can be rapidly developed. The greatest challenge in determining the mechanisms of drug resistance is the quantification of antibiotic concentrations. In general, the quantification of molecules using MALDI-TOF MS may be difficult but is possible. This method could be helpful in the study of efflux and porins. I believe that MALDI-TOF MS can provide many new applications that will be applicable not only in research on drug resistance mechanisms but also the development of routine microbiological diagnostics.",

Analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for this purpose is rapid and economic, the resulting spectra can be very informative. These extraordinary features for the identification of bacteria have lead to the extension of the approach for the characterisation of other microorganisms like yeasts or fungi, and also of tissue cultures and whole animals, especially arthropods. The interest of many users focuses on the question of how detailed MALDI-typing can be at best. Concerning bacteria, it is of greatest interest to which taxonomic level samples can be classified and, in a number of cases, if biovars or serotypes can be reliably distinguished. In contrast to the identification of proteins or peptides by mass spectrometry, the identification of the analyte by MALDI-typing is not based on the comparison of the experimental spectrum with masses calculated from a sequence database but rather on the comparison of the analyte spectrum with a library of reference spectra from authentic samples. Although widely applied, some theoretical aspects of mass spectrum-based classification have not been fully addressed yet. A number of commercial and inhouse softwares implementing different classification algorithms are in use, complicating cross-platform comparison of typing results. One step in most algorithms used for classification is data reduction, i.e. the selection of masses from the reference or sample spectra that are useful for classification. This is especially necessary for the distinction of closely related organisms like subspecies or serotypes, as their spectra will only present a limited number of differing masses. In an effort to characterise the spatial and temporal distribution of Shiga toxinproducing Escherichia coli (STEC) isolates representing the serotypes O165:H25, O26:H11/H32, and O156:H25, we have analysed MALDItype spectra by systematic variation of the data reduction step in our classification algorithm. With optimised parameters, the classification of all three O-serotypes was possible with a false rate below 1%. For all combinations of two of the three groups, parameters could be adjusted to accurately distinguish the two groups.",

Results: MLVF grouped the 78 isolates into two distinct clusters: A (n = 40) and B (n = 38). Importantly, all isolates of cluster A had spatype t024, whereas all isolates of cluster B had spa-type t008. Furthermore, both clusters were composed of several patterns, but within each cluster most of the strains yielded the same pattern.

            "text": "Conclusion: MLVF has the discriminatory power needed to distinguish between the community-acquired USA300 clone and closely related lineages with the same PFGE profile. Additionally, MLVF allows a differentiation of isolates with the same spa-type into sub-clusters, which will be relevant for further epidemiological studies. In addition, exoproteome analyses on the community-acquired USA300 clone and related nosocomial lineages will provide better insights into their virulence potential. Ultimately, this will lead to a better understanding of critical determinants for staphylococcal fitness and pathogenesis. Objectives: To determine the impact rapid epidemiological typing has on the control and transmission of C. difficile. Method: A prospective study was conducted in 15 hospitals in the United Kingdom over 12 months. All faeces samples that were confirmed as toxin positive for C. difficile from periods of increased incidence (PII) which was defined as two or more patients developing C. difficile in a 28 day period on a ward were submitted for typing. Hospitals were randomised into control or test arm, with all isolates in the test arm being typed using modified MLVA typing and isolates in the control arm being typed using PCR ribotyping; all results were fed back in a timely manner. Following the reporting of results from a PII a questionnaire was sent to each Trust to evaluate whether they considered that the typing result had aided their management. The total number of patients positive for C. difficile 48 hours after admission was collected for each hospital and modelled using a negative binomial regression model, including the logarithm of the number of beds in the Trust as an offset term to compensate for the different Trust sizes.",

The number of cases involved in a PII ranged from 2 to 15, with the mean duration of a PII being 19.9 days in the MLVA arm and 19.1 in the ribotyping. Of the 785 samples, typing results were available for 318 (83%) in the ribotyping arm and 351 (88%) in the MLVA arm, 166 samples could not be typed due to not enough sample or isolate could not be cultured. The mean turnaround time for MLVA was 5.3 days as opposed to 13.6 days for ribotyping. Of the 785 cases investigated 208 were considered to be part of an outbreak by the method used for investigation. The number of patients acquiring C. difficile >48 hours after hospital admission during the study period was 814 in the MLVA arm and 868 in the ribotyping arm and the binomial regression model confirmed no differences between the intervention and control group. In response to the questionnaire 43% of respondents in the MLVA arm stated that the results had aided their management as opposed to 8% in the ribotyping arm. Conclusion: MLVA typing provided a rapid turnaround providing results that aided the management of outbreaks. However, due to the multifaceted nature of controlling C. difficile the study did not demonstrate a difference between the two groups. (SID = 93, 4% [92, 6%] ). The emm89 (n = 62) and emm1 (n = 55) isolates were the most prevalent and constitute the two main PFGE clusters, accounting for 37% of the collection.

The emm89 and emm1 clusters were mainly characterized by the presence of speC, speG, smeZ and speA, speG, speJ, smeZ, respectively. It was detected one isolate resistant to chloramphenicol and two nonsusceptible to levofloxacin. Macrolide resistance was detected in 10% of isolates, mostly with the cMLSB phenotype. Tetracycline resistance was detected in 47 isolates, of which 12 were also resistant to macrolides.",

A new serotype, named 11E, was discovered among strains previously identified as serotype 11A, carrying a capsular locus with a mutated or disrupted wcjE gene. In addition, the genomic analysis of three serotype 11A pneumococcal strains revealed a discordance between the serotype and the capsular locus, which corresponded to that associated with the 11D serotype. The aim of this study was to verify which capsular locus was present in serotype 11A pneumococcal strains circulating in Italy.",

Upon stimulation those T cell subsets accumulate that show compromised IL-2 secretion capacities (CD7-) as well as those unable to home (CCR7-) into secondary lymphoid organs like T^EM cells.

However, K65R can be selected by d4T or ddI in non-B subtype HIV-1 and potentially limit use of TDF in subsequent antiretroviral regimen. Only AZT exerts activity against K65R.In developing countries, the most widely used antiretroviral therapy (ART) is non-TDF containing regimens such as d4T, ddI, AZT and 3TC.We aimed to determine the incidence and characteristics of K65R mutation in patients who failed non-TDF containing ART. Objectives: Twenty multi-drug resistance (MDR) patients, who achieved a successful virological suppression with darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) containing regimens, were followed for 72 weeks to examine the evolution of intracellular drug resistance associated mutation (RAMs) pattern. The main aim of this analysis was to assess the ability of the archived viral variants to re-emerge during ART and to establish their role in therapy failure. Methods: All patients belonging from a larger cohort of antiretroviral multi-drug experienced HIV-1 subjects, enrolled at the ''Sapienza'' University Hospital, were included in the study.

Therefore consensus is needed on minimum requirements for the performance of the specialty at an optimal level, appropriate to EU standards. The profile of the specialty and terms for training has been defined many years ago. This profile still is the basis for the training programme and the detailed logbook. According to UEMS Chapter on Training of medical Specialists in the European Community (4) the training program and the logbook have to be implemented and standards and assessment of the quality of training centers and trainers have to be developed. The UEMS Chapter 6 on training, containing these requirements for a 5 year training program, has been adopted during a recent Council meeting in 2011 in Naples (5) Diagnosis of Chagas disease (CD) during the acute phase relies on the direct observation of the parasite in blood. Microhematocrit and Strout's method are the reference techniques while PCR is recommended for congenital cases because of its higher sensitivity. In immunocompromised patients' reactivations, Trypanosoma cruzi may also be detected in other body fluids and tissues. Parasitological methods have low sensitivity for chronic CD thus diagnosis is based on serological testing (usually indirect haemagglutination, indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA), being necessary at least two techniques with a positive result to establish a diagnosis of chronic CD. In this setting, PCR techniques are not enough sensitive for diagnosis but may have a role in discordant cases. Currently, only two drugs with proven efficacy against T. cruzi infection are marketed. The use of benznidazole is generally preferred over nifurtimox because of its better safety profile, tissue penetration and possible higher efficacy. Tolerability of both drugs is not good and a significant number of patients develop adverse reactions that lead to treatment interruption in up to 40% of cases. Assessment of treatment efficacy is difficult because it is affected by the phase of CD, dose, length of treatment, and the end-points evaluated in clinical studies. Trypanocidal treatment has proven to be efficacious in acute, congenital, early chronic infections (children under 18) and reactivations, while its usefulness is much more doubtful in patients with late chronic disease, and probably has no role in advanced organ involvement. As for treatment monitorization serology is the most reliable test for cure. However, while in children serology negativization can take 3-6 years after therapy, in adults with chronic CD this may take up to 10-20 years. Parasitological methods (xenodiagnosis and blood cultures) are poorly sensitive, and PCR could be a useful tool but still awaits for standardization and clinical validation. There are many challenges to overcome about CD. We need more sensitive and standardized T. cruzi detection techniques, to identify markers for disease progression, and validated surrogate markers for response to therapy. There is also an urgent need for better drugs, with improved efficacy and tolerability, paediatric formulations and newer treatment strategies focused on therapy length, drug combinations, retreatment of therapy failures, and management for immunosupressed patients All isolates were susceptible to both vancomycin and daptomycin. There was weak correlation between vMIC and dMIC, (rs = 0.21, p = 0.003). Factors associated with vMIC were increased age, renal failure, the presence of an intravascular catheter, health-care associated acquisition, and IDU, whereas mortality at 30 days was not associated with vMIC (Table 1 ). In the univariate analysis, age, COPD, housing status, and health-care associated acquisition were associated with mortality; however these were not statistically significant in the multivariate analysis.",

Advanced age, renal failure, the presence of an intravascular catheter, and health-care associated acquisition were associated with having a higher vMIC. There was no association found between higher vMIC and mortality. Invasive Fungal infections (IFI) are important causes of morbidity and mortality in immune-compromised patients. Diagnosis relies on culturebased methods, which lack sensitivity and delay diagnosis. PCR for the diagnosis of IFI offers an attractive method for early diagnosis. However, a lack of standardization of fungal PCR assays has limited its acceptance as a diagnostic tool. There is currently no consensus on the optimal blood fraction from which to isolate Candida DNA. A PCR detection limit of <10 CFU/mL in whole blood (WB)have been associated with improved test performance for Candida. A consensus concerning the type of specimen, volume, the extraction method, target, PCR format and platform has to be reached. In 2006, the European Aspergillus PCR Initiative (EAPCRI) was formed. The aim of the initiative was to provide optimal standardized protocols for the clinical evaluation of the Aspergillus PCR to determine its diagnostic role and allow inclusion in disease diagnosis criteria. A standardisation for Aspergillus PCR assay in (WB) and serum has been proposed by the EAPCRI. For the detection of Aspergillus in WB: the importance of the nucleic acid extraction protocol in achieving satisfactory analytical sensitivity was highlighted. For PCR testing of WB: blood volumes (>3 mL) should be be efficiently lysed before bead beating to disrupt the fungal cell and use of an internal control PCR to exclude false negativity. DNA should be eluted in volumes of <100 L. For the dection of Aspergillus in serum: A positive association between sensitivity and the use of larger sample volumes, an internal control PCR and PCR targeting the ITS region was shown. Negative association between sensitivity and the use of larger elution volumes (>100 uL) and PCR targeting the mitochondrial genes was demonstrated. A multi-centre clinical trial is required to determine the clinical validity and utility of both Candida and Aspergillus WB and serum PCR testing, and a multi-centre comparison of WB and serum PCR is required to determine the optimal specimen for PCR diagnosis.",

Regimens containing less than three antiretroviral drugs are currently not recommended based on the high risk of virological failure and selection of drug resistance mutations (DRM) with previous experience of NRTIonly based approaches, except for boosted PIs monotherapy which is optional in patients with intolerance to NRTIs or requiring treatment simplification provided that they never experienced virological failures or admitted in exceptional circumstances. Nevertheless, the investigation of possible new treatment paradigms remains attractive due to the high potency and low risk of selection of drug resistance mutations with PIr based therapies and the established long term toxicity of even newer and currently preferred N(t)RTIs, in particular the renal and bone toxicity of tenofovir and the debated potential association with increased cardiovascular risk of abacavir, which has been described in some cohort studies. New treatment strategies are thus being evaluated in order to try to respond to the unmet medical needs of HIV-infected patients with metabolic complications and increasing risk of concomitant cardiovascular or renal diseases. This talk will review the evidence regarding the safety and the efficacy of alternative treatment paradigms based on older and newer antiretroviral drugs and drug classes and will also try to define the optimal candidates for these regimens. We observed both the carriage of similar KPC-harboring plasmids within genetically distinct strains and the inter-hospital spread of the two major clones ST258 and ST512, belonging to CC258. KPC-3 was also identified in clones ST646, ST650 and ST14 . The blaVIM gene was identified in clones ST646, ST647 and ST648. The blaKPC-3 gene was located on plasmids similar to those previously described in clone ST258 from Israel. The ST258 clone identified in two hospitals harbored an additional IncA/C plasmid, carrying the CMY-2 AmpC beta-lactamase. One patient had an intra-abdominal infection sustained by a ST258 KPC-3-producing clone, but during the treatment with colistin a carbapenem susceptible isolate lacking the plasmid carrying KPC-3 was isolated from the same site and successfully treated with carbapenems. Another patient developed sepsis sustained by a ST512 KPC-3-producing clone, but on the same day a ST512 strain, susceptible to carbapenems and negative to KPC-3, was isolated from urines. In this strain a rearrangement occurred on plasmid, causing the loss of the blaKPC-3 gene. Conclusion: Our findings evidenced an unexpected and high spread of carbapenemase-producing KP in our urban area. Different strains were identified carrying the KPC-3 gene, but all of them were associated to a common plasmid of the pKpQIL type. This plasmid represents the major vehicle of diffusion of KPC-3 among the different strains circulating in this area. However, two major clones where identified: ST512 and ST258, also indicating suggesting inter and intra-hospital spread. Conclusions: In conclusion we report a clonal outbreak of KPCproducing K. oxytoca in Austria involving five patients and lasting for 5 months. While outbreaks of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae have been described frequently no outbreak of KPC-producing K. oxytoca has yet been described to the best of our knowledge. These observations provide some insight in the epidemiology and clinical importance of KPC carbapenemases that pose a serious clinical threat also when produced by K. oxytoca. Objectives: Nosocomial infections sustained by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) are a global health problem. Active surveillance has been maintained in 2011 in 10 hospitals of Rome, demonstrating that the increasing carbapenem resistance in KP was associated to the production of the carbapenemase KPC-3 in two major clones:ST512 and ST258. The entire plasmid content of these strains was investigated by high-throughput sequencing to ascertain the contribution of plasmids to the success of these clones. Methods: Full sequencing of plasmids was performed applying the 454-Genome Sequencer FLX procedure on libraries obtained on total plasmid DNA purified from two archetypal ST258 and ST512 strains. Contigs with at least 15-fold coverage obtained by GS-FLX gAssembler software were assembled by the PCR-based gap closure method. Results: Up to four different plasmids were identified within the strains. The IncFIIk-FIBk plasmid, carrying KPC-3 was identified in both strains and was very similar to plasmid pKpQIL identified in KP ST258 strains from Israel (GU595196). With respect to the former pKpQIL a composite transposon IS26-aphA1-IS26, conferring kanamycin resistance was acquired in the pKpQIL from the ST258 strain identified in Italy. Both strains contained another IncFIIk-FIB-like plasmid, we named pKPN-IT, which was highly related to plasmid pKPN3 identified in KP from USA, conferring resistance to arsenic, copper and silver. Plasmid pKPN-IT showed a Fec-like iron(III) dicitrate transport system, a glutation ABC-transport system, a class 1 integron carrying trimethoprim and streptomycin resistance genes (dfrA12, orfE, aadA2) and the chloramphenicol and macrolide resistance genes (catA1, mphA). One ST258 strain also carried an IncA/C plasmid carrying the AmpC CMY-2 beta-lactamase. Other novel plasmids belonging to untypable groups were also identified within these strains.",

            "text": "The presence of multiple resistance and putative virulence plasmids within KP-KPC-3 clones endowed the strains with a formidable set of resistance genes against toxic compounds, metals and antimicrobial drugs. The presence of the iron (III) uptake system is likely involved in the capacity of the bacterium to acquire iron in the human host. Our study contributes to the description of the characteristics of KP clones that currently represent a serious potential risk for nosocomial settings. Background: Complex epidemiology of KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae (KPC-E) with non-ST258 K. pneumoniae (Kpn) clones was documented in our hospital. Since colonized patients are the main reservoir of multiresistant bacteria, we determined the length of carriage (LOC) with KPC-E in patients with infection and/or colonization with these isolates. Methods: From September-09 to June-11, 19 patients (nine females; median age 75 years, range 24-86) were infected and/or colonized by KPC-E and under routine colonization screening and contact precautions. Swab cultures (chromID-ESBL medium, bioMerieux) from throat and rectum were taken weekly until three consecutive negative cultures, or discharge. Identification (MALDI-TOF) and phenotypic-KPC production (modified Hodge test and boronic acid disc method) was confirmed. KPCs were identified by PCR and sequencing, and the harbouring clones characterized by PFGE and MLST. LOC is defined as the time elapsing between the first and last documented positive culture for KPC-E, and CP (clonal persistence) as the ratio between the average days of colonization per clone and the average days of follow-up per patient. Results: Seventy-five throat and 80 rectal specimens were obtained. KPC-E isolates were recovered in 25.3% (19/75) throat and 52.5% (42/ 80) rectal swabs. Rectal colonization was demonstrated in 68.4% (13/ 19) of the patients, half of them concomitantly with positive pharyngeal cultures. None of the patients had only pharyngeal colonization. The mean duration of follow-up after the first positive KPC-E culture were 28.5 \u00b1 32.4 days (median 18, range . LOC with KPC-E in the patients with positive surveillance cultures (68.4%, 13/19) was 22.5 \u00b1 19.8 days (median 20, range 3-69). KPC-E clones were: K. pneumoniae (12/13 patients) ST20 (2/12), ST384 (6/12), ST454 (1/12) and ST659 (3/12) and two E. coli (Eco) in two patients. One patient was co-colonized with Kpn-ST659 and an Eco clone. Kpn clones showed different CP values (Kpn-ST384, 0.79; ST20, 0.73; ST454, 0.41; and ST659, 0.58). Both Eco clones were detected during all the follow-up period (CP = 1) Conclusions. Rectum was the most sensitive sampling site for detecting KPC-E colonization. Pharyngeal colonization was not present in the absence of rectal carriage. K. pneumoniae clones exhibited different lengths-of-colonization (LOC) values. Such variability encourages the need of identifying clonal factors involved in to long persistence that could enhance clone transmissibility. Clinical strains were isolated from different body sites (blood, urine, rectal swabs or sputum), during the patient hospitalization, in particular when the antibiotic resistance profile changed. Species identification and antimicrobial susceptibilities were obtained by Vitek2 System (bioM\u00e9rieux). All of isolates were suspected for KPC production based on synergistic activity with phenylboronic acid. Imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, colistin and tigecycline susceptibility was assessed also by E test. A total of 52 isolates were chosen as representative and further investigated by genotyping. PCR for blaKPC-like genes and sequencing were performed. PFGE and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were used to investigate clonal relatedness. Results: All 52 isolates resulted KPC-positive, harbouring blaKPC-3 gene. Carbapenem MICs ranged from 4 mg/L to >32 mg/L and 18 isolates were resistant to colistin (in the range of 4-24 mg/L), whereas only five isolates were still sensitive to tigecycline. PFGE analysis revealed the spread of one prevalent clone belonging to ST512 and showing seven pulsotypes clonal variants (pt A1-A7), and two sporadic clones, belonging to ST258 (pt A8) and ST101 (pt B). Several isolates with distinct genotypes in the same patient were found, suggesting that the colonizing strain may occasionally be replaced.",

Further, it was possible to point out a synergistic interaction of the involved species in forming dual-species biofilm. The FESEM analysis allowed us to distinguish between the two biofilm-forming bacterial species on the basis of their different features (rods or spear-shaped bacilli vs. cocci). Further, this morphological approach offered the chance to approximately evaluate the relative contribution of the two interacting species to form the mixed biofilm. Conclusion: As far as we know this is the first report on the ability to in vitro adhere and to form single/dual-species biofilms exhibited by anaerobic strains belonging to the species Bacteroides oralis, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium baratii, Clostridium fallax, Clostridium bifermentans, Finegoldia magna, Fusobacterium necrophorum. Further, the in vitro development of dual-species biofilms by the couples Fusobacterium necrophorum + Veillonella spp, Bacteroides fragilis + Finegoldia magna, and Finegoldia magna + Clostridium difficile has a particular significance because of the above mentioned selective criteria. This finding is in favour of the possible coaggregation of some species belonging to the intestinal microbiota to form in vivo sessile-growing polimicrobial communities. Multiresistant gram-positive bacteria are a continuing and rising threat in hospitals worldwide. Complex mechanisms enable these pathogens to exchange genetic information, especially the distribution of resistance determinants leads to their propensity to cause hospital outbreaks as well as endemic spread. Here, we report that one of the very factors responsible for genetic exchange, namely a specific protein of the so-called type four secretion systems, represents an Achilles heel that can be harnessed to fight these often untreatable infections. A prototypical gram-positive type four secretion system is present on plasmid pIP501, and several proteins of the transfer region have been expressed in E. coli. Rabbit sera were raised against two proteins, i.e. ORF10 and ORF13, that code for an ATPase and a putative channel component. The rabbit sera were used in an opsonophagocytic assay and sera raised against ORF13 showed 77% killing of the homologous strain at a dilution of 1:10. Using absorption of the sera with increasing amounts of purified protein this killing could be inhibited by up to 44.5%. Testing of a larger collection of strains from different species revealed that 3/4 (75%) E. faecalis, 2/4 (50%) E. faecium, and 5/5 (100%) S. aureus were effectively killed by anti-ORF13 at a dilution of 1:10, including one vancomycin-resistant S. aureus strain and several USA300 CA-MRSA. Western Blot analysis demonstrated crossreactive protein bands in two of three tested E. faecalis-, three of four E. faecium and a total of five S. aureus strains, respectively. The homologous strain E. faecalis JH2-2pIP501 (expressing protein Orf13) shows a band at 37.5 kDa. Using a mouse bacteremia model, significant reductions in colony counts were seen in animals that had received anti-ORF13 as compared to animals that had received antisera against ORF10 and were challenged with the homologous E. faecalis, as well as with an E. faecium and a CA-MRSA strain. Animals infected with the homologous E. faecalis that were not carrying plasmid pIP501 were not protected. These data demonstrate that ORF13 is the target of opsonic and protective antibodies and may therefore be a promising and broadly cross-protective vaccine candidate targeting multi-resistant gram-positive pathogens.",

The development of new methods for the bacteria isolation and PCR-identification techniques in the 1990s led to the recognition of K. kingae as a leading cause of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis in children younger than 2 years old. The bacterium is also a cardiovascular pathogen causing infective endocarditis. K. kingae produces a potent protein toxin of the RTX-group, RtxA. Methods: Kingella kingae septic arthritis isolate PYKK081 was grown on Columbia agar containing 5% sheep blood and 2 lg/mL vancomycin for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C, a number of bacteria was identified by colony forming units count. Active RtxA was purifed from PYKK081 cytosolic fraction. The toxin-deficient mutant was created using mariner transposon mutagenesis. Three-week old Sprague-Dawley rats were used in animal models. Mammalian cell lines were obtained from ATCC. Results: Kingella kingae toxicity: Cohorts of rats were injected intraperitoneally with different doses (from 1 \u00b7 10^9 to 1 \u00b7 10^6 cells/animal) of PYKK081, 50% lethal dose (LD50) was 1.3 \u00b7 10^8 cells/animal. Septic arthritis model: Right rat knee joints were injected intraarticularly with different doses (from 1 \u00b7 10^5 to 1 \u00b7 10^2 cells) of PYKK081. Left knee joint was injected with saline. Thirty one percent of animals injected with 1 \u00b7 10^5 and 1 \u00b7 10^4 bacterial cells demonstrated features of acute inflammation in the infected joint for first 72 hours. Histopathological examination of the joint and adjacent bones 7 days after infection revealed the signs of chronic inflammation. RtxA: The secreted RtxA (>1 lg/mL) had toxic effect on human, rat, rabbit and mouse white blood cells. When tested at high concentrations (>40 lg/mL), the toxicity of RtxA was also detected on other cell types including human synovial cells and osteoblasts. The toxic effect of the isogenic rtxA mutant on the mammalian cells under the same conditions was not detected. Conclusion: This is the first study toward the development of in vivo model for K. kingae pathogenesis. The bacterium is shown to cause infections in rat offspring. A rat model of knee septic arthritis due to K. kingae is proposed. RtxA primarily affects multiple types of leukocytes suggesting the toxin role in host immune response evasion. RtxA is responsible for the major cytotoxic effect of K. kingae on mammalian cells.",

Our goal was to investigate the role of neutrophils in respiratory infection with L. longbeachae. To this extent mice were treated with anti-Gr-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) before and after infection and survival, bacterial loads, pathology and leukocyte content of the lung was analyzed and compared with untreated animals. Methods: Control C57Bl/6 mice (6-8 weeks old) were inoculated intratracheally with a sublethal dose of 10^3 L. longbeachae NSW150. At various time points after inoculation, mice were sacrificed and leukocytes were isolated from the lungs. Myeloid cells were stained for FACS analysis. Mice were injected either with 25 or 250 ug/dose anti-Gr-1 18 hours before and 24 hours after infection. For the survival assay mice were observed for 14 days post-infection. For enumeration of bacterial load at different time points CFU in lungs and liver was determined. Histological sections of lungs were prepared and stained with hemotoxylin and eosin. Statistical significance was assessed using two-way analysis of variance or a Student's t test in GraphPad Prism software.",

Conclusion: In neutrophil-depleted mice L. longbeachae causes more severe infection and neutrophils play an important role in host resistance against this bacterium. Introduction: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) causes approximately 2 million deaths a year. Extensive lung destruction is the hallmark of pulmonary tuberculosis and is caused by breakdown of extracellular matrix by host matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Hypoxia upregulates the gene expression and secretion of many inflammatory mediators via hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), the master regulator of the adaptive response to hypoxia. Tissue hypoxia has been demonstrated in animal models of tuberculosis (Tb) but investigation of hypoxia in human disease has not been performed. Objective: To investigate the hypothesis that hypoxia increases MMP activity in Tb infection in a HIF-1a dependent manner Methods: Human respiratory epithelial cells and primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were either directly infected with Mtb H37RV or stimulated with the Conditioned Media from Tb infected monocytes (CoMTb). Experiments were conducted in real hypoxia (1% or 10% O2 with 5% CO2) or chemical hypoxia using dimethyloxalyl glycine (DMOG). MMP and TIMP concentration were measured by ELISA and Luminex array, gene expression by PCR and promoter activity by dual luciferase assay. Total HIF-1a protein was measured by western blot analysis. Results: Hypoxia increased Mtb-induced MMP-1 secretion 3.5 fold (p < 0.001) and MMP-9 secretion 2.1 fold (p < 0.01) compared with Mtb infected cells in normoxia. Additionally, hypoxia decreased secretion of the specific Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase (TIMP-1) which inhibit MMPs in a 1:1 manner. In A549 respiratory epithelial cells, 1% O2 upregulated MMP-1 gene expression 95 fold at 6 hours and markedly increased MMP-1 promoter activity (p < 0.001). NF-kB blockade with Helenalin significantly down-regulated MMP-1 secretion in hypoxia (1% O2) in MDMs. In contrast, 10% O2 decreased MMP-1 secretion in by 80.6% in MDMs (p < 0.001) and 50.4% in lung epithelial cells (p < 0.001) compared with normoxia. Western blot analysis from MDMs infected with Mtb in normoxia demonstrated accumulation of HIF-1a, maximal at 24 hours. In respiratory epithelial cells, HIF-1a stabilisation occurred at 6 hours and was via a networking effect rather than direct infection with Mtb. This is the first time that Tbdriven HIF accumulation has been described.",

Conclusion: L-D Glutamate interconversion is a key process for A. baumannii to form abiotic biofilms and attach to HeLa eukaryotic cells.

Biofilms were quantified using various models and under various conditions, the most useful and high throughput of these is the crystal violet biofilm assay. Various phenotypic assays were used to visualise curli (proteinaceous filaments) and cellulose (polysaccharide) production, important components of a Salmonella biofilm extracellular matrix. Differences in expression of biofilm related genes between wild-type and efflux mutants were determined using qRT-PCR. Results: Sixteen of the 17 efflux mutants formed significantly less biofilm than wild-type in all biofilm assays tested. The reason for this biofilm defect was a lack of curli expressed on their cell surface. qRT-PCR showed that this defect in curli expression was as a result of repression at the transcriptional level. In addition to genetic inactivation of the multidrug resistance efflux pumps, chemical inactivation with efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) PA beta N, CCCP and chlorpromazine, also inhibits the formation of biofilms in the wild-type strain.

It also shows that this phenomenon is not specific to AcrAB-TolC or even RND efflux pumps but is a generic effect seen with four different classes of multidrug resistance efflux pump. Objectives: Staphylococcus aureus is a dangerous bacterial pathogen whose virulence is expressed through various forms ranging from pyogenic tissue invasion to systemic toxic shock syndromes. In this latter situation the prototypical superantigen is TSST-1 (Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin 1), encoded by tst, which is carried on a mobile genetic element and not present in all S. aureus strains. Thus transcriptional regulation of tst is only partially understood. Evidence exists for regulation by the catabolite regulator protein CcpA, the twocomponent SrrAB sensor, the quorum sensing system agr, and the global accessory regulator, SarA. In this study, we have further dissected the role of sarA, sarS (sarH1), RNAIII, with particular emphasis on the alternative stress sigma factor sigmaB.",

Furthermore, sarS, another member of the sarA family, was shown to impart an additional level of negative regulation.

Objective: To assess the effectiveness of a hand hygiene improvement program (HHIP) in 13 European intensive care units (ICUs); and to quantify the effect of known determinants. Methods: We conducted a 26-month intervention study with the ICU as unit of inference. After a 6 month baseline period (phase 1), a HHIP was implemented for 6 months (intensive HHIP, phase 2), using the WHO ''My 5 Moments for Hand Hygiene'' concept. Observations were performed at random dates, time-intervals and bed spaces. In the last 14 months of the study, focus shifted towards another (non-related) intervention, whilst HHIP continued (continued HHIP, phase 3). Mixed effects logistic regression modelling was performed, with random effects for phase and hospital. Results: 44 764 hand hygiene opportunities were observed in 13 European ICUs. Hand hygiene compliance (HHC) varied widely between ICUs in baseline (range 7-88%; mean 52% (95%CI of peers' high compliance, and ABHR as a cue to memory for HH. Nurses can also be influenced by a message that their peers expect them to comply, while doctors should be reminded that ABHR is always available. Risk factors: 60.3% of new +ves and 51% of negatives were checklist positive for one or more risk-factor. In an average trust, screening only checklist +ve patients would reduce the number of screens from 858-478 a week, and identify 82% of positives. Screening only those in high risk specialties would reduce the number of screens to 94 a week, but identify only 10% of +ves. Conclusions: Uptake of admission screening was low (especially emergency and day-case admissions) as was the yield of MRSA+ve patients. The use of checklist activated screening would reduce the number of MRSA admission screens by 50% but identify 82% of all +ves. Screening high risk specialties only would reduce screens by c90% but identify only 10% of +ves. Health Economic modelling will use this data to determine the most cost effective screening policy.",

Kramers, A. Voss, H. Huntjens-Fleuren (Nijmegen, NL) Objective: Timely switching from intravenous antibiotics to oral is important to improve patient safety and reduce costs associated with intravenous therapy. For this reason, numerous interventions have been devised, and have shown to improve antibiotic switching. However, these interventions are usually time-consuming and therefore expensive and difficult to implement. We have introduced an intervention that relies on a computerized trigger, which intelligently identifies patients who are candidates for antibiotic switching. This was combined with weekly discussing switch therapy during the microbiology-infectious disease multidisciplinary meeting. With this intervention we aimed to improve the rate of intravenous to oral antibiotic switching. Methods: Intervention was performed on all the internal medicine wards in a large teaching hospital. Daily an automated trigger tool selected patients eligible for switch based on data from the pharmaceutical and patient system. Patients were identified as eligible when parenteral antibiotics were used for 48-72 hours. Patients were ineligible for switch when CRP was rising, neutrophils were <0,5*109/ mL or leukocytes <1*109/mL, inability to receive oral therapy or when an antibiotic was prescribed for which nor oral option was available. Before daily rounds, per candidate for antibiotic switch, a form was generated and given to the resident caring for the patient. Information concerning the ability to switch and reasons which impeded the switch were recorded. Median iv days per iv prescription and number of iv prescriptions \u202172 hours in the intervention period were compared to a similar period the year preceding the intervention. Results: Of 156 forms generated in 603 iv antibiotic prescriptions, 92 (59%) were filled in and returned. In 52% of cases this form led to an iv-oral switch. Median number of IV days was reduced by 1 (3 vs. 2, p < 0.0001). Number of iv prescriptions longer than 72 hours was reduced by 45% (44% vs. 24%). Reasons for not switching antibiotic therapy were inability to receive oral therapy (36%), clinical instability (21%) and stopping antibiotic therapy in 16% of the patients. Conclusions: We designed an intervention which uses an computerized trigger to identify patients who are candidates for antibiotic switch therapy in combination with frequent but short term education of residents. This was effective in promoting antibiotic switch therapy and reducing number of IV days >72 hours. Objective: The outcome in patients with sepsis is better if the initial empirical antimicrobial treatment is adequate, and several studies have shown that adherence to guidelines on antibiotic use positively influences the clinical outcome. However, adequate empiric therapy is not the only relevant determinant of outcome. Quality indicators (QI) are measurable elements which can be used to assess the actual quality of care provided. They can be systematically derived from guidelines. Objective of the present study was to develop a valid set of QI which can accurately measure quality of antimicrobial treatment in hospitalized adults with sepsis. Such QI for sepsis are at present lacking. We derived the QI from the recently published, evidence-based Dutch guideline on antimicrobial treatment of adult patients with sepsis (www.swab.nl/guidelines). Methods: A RAND-modified, five step Delphi procedure was used. A multidisciplinary panel of 13 experts appraised and prioritized all graded recommendations retrieved from the Dutch consensus guideline for antimicrobial therapy on sepsis. The selection of the QI potentially relevant for clinical outcome, antimicrobial resistance and costs was done using two questionnaire mailings with a face-to-face consensus meeting between rounds, over a period of 3 months. Results: Forty recommendations were initially derived from the sepsis guideline. After appraising these recommendations in the first questionnaire, 31 potential QI remained. During the consensus meeting 17 potential QI were merged into four generic QI, leaving 20 potential QI. Prioritizing these by the experts resulted into a final set of five potential QI: take two blood cultures together with cultures from suspected sites of infection, prescribe empirical antibiotic therapy according to the national guideline, start antibiotics intravenously, start antibiotics as soon as possible (preferably within an hour) and streamline antibiotic therapy. Conclusion: With this systematic, stepwise method combining evidence and expert opinion, a new, concise and therefore measurable set of process QI for antimicrobial therapy in sepsis was obtained. These QI can give insight into the actual quality of the given care and could be used to determine for which aspects there is room for improvement. Testing the feasibility, reliability and case-mix sensitivity of these indicators in practice will be the next step before using them in quality improvement projects.",

Since 2007, within a regional Antibiotics Commission, actions have been implemented, such as the validation of local protocols for AB treatment or surgical prophylaxis and sharing them on a website, the broadcasting of messages to the appropriate use of AB developed by a working group, the organization of regional trainings, the harmonization of indicators for monitoring AB consumption and bacterial resistance and the proposal of a tool for decision support to guide improvement actions (according to D. Monnet). We performed a cross-sectional study in 2007 and 2010 to assess the evolution of implementation of antibiotic stewardship by collecting the annual indicators of antibiotics consumption and bacterial resistance. Results: Of the 56 regional hospitals, 36 participated in the crosssectional survey (64%). Between 2007 and 2010, the degree of implementation of measures to manage antibiotics has increased: 89% of hospitals have antibiotics advisors (vs. 68% in 2007, p < 0.01), 95% use local protocols for antibiotic therapy and prophylaxis (vs. 70% in 2007, p < 0.001), 58% have antibiotics prescription software (vs. 14%, p < 0.001). For 80.5% of hospitals, the pharmacist dispenses antibiotics with pharmaceutical analysis (vs. 47%, p < 0.001). For monitoring the indicators of AB use and bacterial resistance, the participation of hospitals has increased over the last 3 years (31 in 2007 and 46 in 2010). Among the 26 hospitals who participated in annual data collection, AB consumption decreased by 8% in 3 years, with a significant decrease in the use of fluoroquinolones (37.27 DDD/1000 PD vs. 47.7DDD/1000 PD, p < 0.05).",

            "text": "Conclusion: The regional monitoring has created a professional dynamics for the good use of antibiotics. Every year, the participation of regional hospitals in the project increases. After The success of this regional program allows its extension to other categories of hospitals (rehabilitation centers and nursing home) is required in 2012. Objectives: Regular feedback of antibiotic usage data helps promote rational prescribing, reduce inappropriate use, and potentially slow the development and spread of resistance.1,2 Such ''antimicrobial stewardship'' strategies are recommended in the Health and Social Care Act 2008, which English hospitals have to take account of for registration with the Care Quality Commission.3 Our objective was to describe the frequency and types of antibiotic usage data fed back to clinicians in English hospitals. Methods: An electronic audit was e-mailed to the antimicrobial pharmacist of each acute hospital NHS Trust in England (n = 151). The survey software (Adobe Acrobat \u00d2 ) recorded responses, before analysis in Excel \u00d2 . Results: The response rate was 79%. Figure 1 shows reports on antibiotic usage provided to clinical teams, and their frequency. Information on expenditure was more commonly provided (78%) than Daily Defined Doses (DDDs, 70%) or packs/prescriptions (29%). 80% of DDD reports were split into parenteral and oral forms; 53% reported use by speciality, and 43% by outpatient vs. inpatient use. Antibiotic point prevalence studies (PPS) were conducted by 86% of Trusts, but fed back less frequently to clinicians than expenditure or to the LUMC where PCR ribotyping was performed. Web-based questionnaires were used to collect clinical and epidemiological data. Results: In total, 1052 patients were included in the survey and 926 (88%) isolates were obtained. The mean incidence was 15 per 10 000 hospital admissions. Type 001 was the most frequently found type (20%), followed by type 014 (13%), 078 (12%) and 002 (6%). Type 027 was found in 3%. Twelve outbreaks were observed, mainly associated with type 001. Of 694 patients clinical information was available. Half of them were female, the mean age was 67 years. 177 patients (26.6%) were defined as community-onset CDI. Most patients (70.5%) used antibiotics prior to the start of diarrhoea. A total of 129 patients (20.2%) had severe CDI. After 30 days, 68 patients with CDI (12.8%) died; two deaths were attributable to CDI and 16 deaths were contributable to CDI. Half of these patients had CDI due to type 001. Other types involved in attributable or contributable death were type 014, 005, 228, 045. Conclusion: We conclude that the incidence of CDI is stable in the Netherlands and that types 001 and 014 are still predominant types. The incidence rate of C. difficile PCR ribotype 027 remains low as previously reported. Extrapolating the data of sentinel surveillance to all hospitals in The Netherlands, it is estimated that more than 2700 hospitalized patients annually will develop CDI of which 100 will succumb attributable or contributable to CDI. Incidence per 10000 bed-days (excluding repeat positives within 14 days) was calculated over calendar time for EIA-positive culture-positive CDI and for the 10 most common strains, and compared across strains using stacked negative binomial regression with natural cubic splines to reflect nonlinear calendar trends. Results: Over the study period, incidence of EIA-positive culturepositive CDI declined from 9.4 per 10000 bed-days in Q4 2007-2.9 in Q1 2011 (per-annum decline (incidence rate ratio) 22%, 95% CI 18-27%). Of 943 EIA-positive culture-positive CDI in OUH inpatients, the 10 most common sequence types (STs) were 179 (19%) ST1 (PCR-ribotype 027), 81 (9%) ST2 (ribotypes 014/020), 81 (9%) ST8 (ribotype 002), 60 (6%) ST6 (ribotype 005), 50 (5%) ST3 (ribotypes 001/072), 44 (5%) ST44 (ribotype 015), 40 (4%) ST5 (ribotype 023), 36 (4%) ST42 (ribotype 106), 34 (4%) ST10 (also ribotype 015) and 27 (3%) ST11 (ribotype 078) (311 (33%) other less common STs). In Q4 2007, ST1 and ST42 accounted for 36 (36%) and 8 (8%) of the 98 CDI -but neither ST was observed in 16 CDI in Q1 2011, and they accounted for only 11 (8%) and 2 (2%) of the 133 CDI during 2010, per-annum declines of 65% (95% CI 58-71%) and 64% (95% CI 48-75%) respectively over the study period. Other STs apart from ST11 also declined over the study period, but at a significantly slower rate than ST1 and ST42 (12% pa (95% CI 3-18%): p < 0.0001 vs. ST1/ ST42). In contrast, there was marginal evidence that ST11 was not declining in the same way as other common STs, but instead increasing, with an estimated annual increase in incidence of 32% (95% CI 10% decrease to 95% increase; p = 0.045 vs. other STs, p < 0.0001 vs. ST1/ST42), although to an absolute level which still remained relatively low. Conclusion: Declines in CDI in Oxfordshire inpatients were driven by declines in ST1 and ST42 suggesting that these may have been particularly susceptible to hospital-based interventions. ST11 (PCRribotype 078) may be increasing in Oxfordshire.",

Data were obtained from October 2006 to December 2009 and split into a preintervention and post-intervention period by the introduction of a restricted antibiotic policy in October 2008. Monthly data on antibiotic use, CDI incidence and mortality were used and adjusted for clinical activity using hospital admissions data. Results: Analysis was performed on patients admitted through the acute medical admissions unit (medicine) and patients admitted to any of six surgical wards (surgical). There were no changes in crude 30-day all cause mortality for patients in medicine and surgery. Subgroup analysis by Age and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score revealed no changes following the intervention. A separate study at the same hospital showed that patients that had a blood culture taken were four times more likely to die within 30 days of admissions than those that did not and that most of the increased risk of death was attributable to sepsis. To ensure that an increase in deaths from sepsis was not masked by a decrease in deaths from other causes, 30-day mortality was analysed in patients that had blood cultures taken. Statistical analysis confirmed no significant abrupt or sustained change after the intervention in medicine or surgery and the direction of all changes was negative demonstrating a reduction in mortality post intervention. In the medicine cohort the change in slope was a reduction by 3 deaths per 1000 patients per month, p = 0.19 (95%CI -4.5 to +1.5). Subgroup analysis by Age and CCI score did not show any evidence of increase in mortality.",

Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of all patients admitted at IUCPQ for which a C. difficile diagnostic assay was ordered between August 1st, 2010 and July 31st, 2011. All submitted specimens were tested in parallel by commercial PCR targeting toxin B tcdB gene, and by a two-tiers algorithm based on EIA detection of glutamate deshydrogenase (GDH) and toxins A and B (ToxA/B), followed by cell culture cytotoxicity assay (CCNA) in case of positive GDH but negative ToxA/B EIA. Healthcare-associated CDI incidence rates were compared, and incidence rate ratios were calculated using univariate Poisson regression. Results: Overall, 1321 stool samples (from 888 patients) were tested in parallel during the study period representing 95 750 patient-days of surveillance. A total of 224 specimens (17.0%) were positive by PCR, and 162 (12.3%) were positive by EIA/CCNA (absolute difference, 62 cases; p < 0.001 by chi-square test). Furthermore, 158 cases were positive by both PCR and EIA/CCNA algorithm, 66 cases were positive by PCR but negative by EIA/CCNA, and four cases were negative by PCR but positive by EIA/CCNA. The overall incidence rate was 8.9 per 10 000 patient-days (95% CI, 7.1-10.9) by PCR, and 5.8 per 10 000 patient-days (95% CI, 4.4-7.4) by EIA/CCNA. Among the 13 administrative periods of the study, incidence rates were above the government-imposed target of 9.0 cases per 10 000 patient-days for 7 periods (54%) using PCR, and 4 periods (31%) using EIA/CCNA. The incidence rate ratio comparing PCR and EIA/CCNA was 1.52 (95% CI, 1.08-2.13; p = 0.015). There was a wide variation in the magnitude of discordance between the two diagnostic methods depending on the administrative period, from 0 to 6.7 cases per 10 000 patient-days. Conclusion: Performing PCR instead of EIA/CCNA is associated with a more than 50% increase in CDI incidence density. In the context of mandatory and public reporting of CDI rates, rates should be stratified according to the diagnostic method to improve intra-and inter-hospital comparison.",

Methods: During Sep-Oct 2011, two clusters of CDI cases were identified in our hospital group in Oxfordshire. Three CDI cases occurred over 3 days on a long-stay medical ward, and three over 22 days in an elective surgery unit. DNA from cultured isolates and the last preceding CDI isolate from each location (12 days and 6 months earlier respectively) was sequenced, four isolates at a time, using the Illumina MiSeq platform in runs lasting 27 hours. Paired 150 base pair reads were mapped to the CD630 reference genome with STAMPY. Variant calls were made using SAMTOOLS, PICARD and Python scripts. Velvet de novo assemblies were used to determine 'in-silico' multi-locus sequence types (MLST) to provide a traditional genotyping comparison to WGS. Results: All eight isolates were successfully sequenced (mean 78.1% of the reference genome called after filtering). Total sample preparation, sequencing and analysis time from receipt of the last positive culture was <1 week. All four medical patients shared time and space on the same ward after diagnosis of the 1st case. Sequence data revealed >4000 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) between each of the three cases occurring within 3 days excluding the possibility of transmission. However one of the isolates was genetically identical (0 SNVs) to the case from 12 days before, highlighting the likely importance of this case in transmission which had not been considered by the initial infection control investigation. While similar conclusions would have been drawn using MLST, the exact genetic match between the two related cases would not have been known. In contrast, within the surgical unit where all three clustered cases spent time together, MLST data suggested two of the three cases were potentially related, however these two cases were actually 129 SNVs apart refuting the possibility of transmission between them. Intriguingly one of the surgical cases differed by only 7 SNVs from a medical case despite neither patient having been to the same hospital in the last year and the cases living 30 miles apart. Conclusion: Comparing whole genomic sequences distinguishes related from unrelated isolates in a potential CDI outbreak setting. The rapid turnaround of desktop sequencing demonstrates the prospect of using this approach in focused outbreak investigation.",

Rybkova (Saint-Petersburg, RU)Materials and methods: Bronchoscopy was performed in 116 cases of nosocomial pneumonia. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) was investigated microbiologically. The identification was performed by routine methods and by sequencing of 16sRNA gene (ABI Prism 3130, MicroSeq ID 16s rDNA500 Library v2.0). Resistance to routinely used antibiotics was investigated with dilution techniques on Muller-Hinton agar (Oxoid, GB). Results: One hundred and fifty-one bacterial strains were isolated from BAL in 116 cases of nosocomial pneumonia in 2010-2011. Grampositive bacteria were revealed in 76 (50.3%) cases. E. faecalis was isolated from BAL in 27 (17.9%), E. faecium in 17 (11.3%), S. aureus in 16 (10.6%), S. epidermidis in 10 (6.6%), S. pneumonia in 2 (1.3%), S. mitis in 2 (1.3%) and B. cereus in 2 (1.3%) patients. Totally 75 (49.7%) gram-negative bacteria were isolated from BAL: K. pneumoniae in 20 (13.2%), P. aeruginosa in 15 (9.9%), A. baumannii in 11 (7.3%), E. coli in 10 (6.6%), S. maltophilia in 6 (3.9%), Enterobacter spp. (E. aerogenes, E. cloacae) in 6 (3.9%), S. marcescens in 1 (0.7%), P. fluorescens in 1 (0.7%), B. cepacia in 1 (0.7%), M. catarrhalis in 1 (0.7%), C. freundii in 1 (0.7%), P. mirabilis in 1 (0.7%), K. oxytoca in 1 (0.7%) case. Resistance to antibiotics was revealed in 140 (92.7%) strains. Resistant to four and more antibiotics were 70 (46.4%) isolates. The highest ratio of polyresistant strains were observed in E. faecium (100.0%), A. baumannii (90.9%), S. epidermidis (70.0%). Meticillin-resistant were 3 (18.7%) of S. aureus and 7 (70.0%) of S. epidermidis strains. No resistance to linezolid and daptomycin was observed in grampositives, to tigecycline in gram-negatives. Conclusions: 1 Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were revealed with the same frequency in cases of nosocomial pneumonia. 2 Most of bacterial isolates (92.7%) were resistant to antibiotics, one half of isolates were polyresistant. 3 Meticillin-resistance was predominantly observed in S. epidermidis. 4 All gram-positive microorganisms were susceptible to linezolid and daptomycin, gram-negative -to tigecycline.O350 Prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria responsible for bloodstream infections in Marseille hospitals, France, 2001-2011 M.

HIV infection O556 Comparisons of serological responses to different doses of hepatitis A vaccine between HIV-positive and HIVnegative men who have sex with men in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy Y. Tseng*, W. Liu, C. Wu, Y. Su, H. Sun, C. Hsieh, P. Wu, S. Chang, C. Lu, C. Hung (Taipei, TW) Background: Vaccination against hepatitis A virus (HAV) has been recommended for men who have sex with men (MSM). HIV-positive persons respond less favorably to HAV vaccination than HIV-negative persons. Whether an extra dose of HAV vaccine can improve serologic responses among HIV-positive persons remains controversial in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Methods MSM who were seronegative for HAV and aged <40 years were enrolled from June 2009 to Dec 2010. HIV-positive MSM was provided with free-of-charge vaccination with two doses (administered at 0 and 24th week) or three doses (administered at 0, 4th, 24th week) of HAV vaccine, and HIV-negative MSM was provided with regular two doses of HAV vaccine (administered at 0 and 24th week). Primary end point of the study was seropositivity for HAV (anti-HAV antibody IgG) at 48th week of vaccination. Quantification of anti-HAV antibody was performed at 48th and 72th week of vaccination. Results: During the study period, 582 MSM were enrolled: 217 HIVnegative MSM and 140 HIV-positive MSM (94 [67.1%] on HAART) received 2-doses of HAV vaccine; and 225 HIV-positive MSM (113 [58.2%] on HAART) received 3-doses of HAV vaccine. All subjects had completed the planned 48 weeks of follow-up. The response rate at 48th week was 75.7% (106/140) and 76.4% (172/225) (p = 0.5) for HIV-positive MSM who received two doses and two doses of HAV vaccine, respectively, and the rate was 88.5% (192/217) for HIVnegative MSM, according to intention-to-treat analysis with the last observation carried forward analysis. In multivariate analysis, HAV vaccination that was administered when the subject's CD4 count was greater than 200 cells per cubic millimeter was significantly associated with a better serologic response. The geometric mean titers of anti-HAV antibody IgG were 75.5, 212.8, and 280.4 mIU/mL (p < 0.001) in the 2-dose HIV-positive, 3-dose HIV-positive, and HIV-negative MSM group, respectively. Conclusions: An extra dose of HAV vaccine does not improve serologic responses in HIV-positive persons at 48 weeks of follow-up in the cART era. HIV-positive persons with CD4 counts greater than 200 cells per cubic millimeter at vaccination is associated with better serologic responses.

Almirante, A. Pahissa (Barcelona, ES)Background: The ability of Candida species to form biofilms impairs the treatment of infected catheters. Removal of the catheter poses a problem when infection involves a highly needed catheter. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of anidulafungin (ANI) in the treatment of C. Of 44% of patients presented with decompensated chronic liver disease. Most of infections were due to Candida and predominant species causing IFI were Candida albicans (34%) and C. glabrata (34%). Other markers of disease were: concomitant bacterial infection in 96% of patients, 74% underwent major abdominal surgery, renal failure 62%, upper GI bleeding 42%, renal replacement therapy 40%, diabetes 36% and prior Candida colonization 42%. 76% of patients received antifungal prophylaxis within 30 days prior to the start of ANI. A favourable outcome was seen in 65% patients. Four patients had breakthrough infections due to C. parapsilosis (2), and C. glabrata (2). There was one case of persistent C. glabrata infection despite ANI therapy. Favourable clinical response was observed in 30 out of 45 evaluated patients (71.1%). 54% of patients had abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) at start of ANI and 30% at the end of ANI therapy. Rises in LFTs were mainly due to the underlying disease. 38% died because of liver disease progression and multiorgan failure and none of these deaths were attributed to fungal infection, or medication related. Conclusion: In this highly selective group of patients, ANI for the treatment of IFI appeared to be effective, safe and well tolerated. A favourable outcome was observed in 65% of patients.Objectives: Recent studies showed that, in the last years, a slight decrease in bacteraemia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as well as significant increase in those due to Multidrug resistant gram-negative (MDR-Gn) occurred in Europe.Objectives: Our aims were (i) to analyze the risk factors for colonization with extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producing Proteus mirabilis (ESBLPM) and (ii) to characterize the molecular features of these strains.Methods:The study was conducted in two rehabilitation centers; in Tel-Aviv, Israel (TA), and Rome, Italy (RM), from October 2008 to April 2011.

In one of four ICU's, two separate outbreaks of EKP that occurred in 2008 and 2009 were linked based on identical PFGE patterns. Further research was done to investigate and control the outbreak. Methods: In our hospital all ICU patients are treated with selective digestive decontamination with routine surveillance cultures of sputum and rectum twice weekly. All ICU patients with EKP between July 2007 and July 2009 were included in the first fingerprint analysis. Subsequent isolates from the ICUs with the typical susceptibility pattern of the identified outbreak strain were subjected to molecular typing. An outbreak management team was formed and multiple measures were implemented to control the outbreak. Results: Of the 56 EKP isolates identified, 25 were clonal and all had identical susceptibility patterns and different from the remaining 31 isolates. Contact isolation was performed in all EKP positive patients until ICU discharge or, if admitted to the wards, until two negative cultures were obtained. A time-line was constructed that showed several episodes without EKP positive patients. An external source was suspected. Environmental screening cultures using a selective broth revealed the outbreak EKP strain in two sinks. Cleaning of the sinks was intensified (twice daily with chlorine 250 PPM), and tap water was",

No specific indications for infection control measures are available although a multifaceted strategy (MS) seems to be the best option. We reviewed the literature to define the effect of different combinations of interventions on the acquisition rate of MDR-Gn. Methods: Literature up to May 2011 was searched, to identify MS studies to control MDR-Gn hospital spread. The rate of the MDR-Gn acquisition after MSs was the major assessed outcome. Our systematic review suggests that including HH, EDU, CP and IR in a MS has the greatest chance of success in controlling the nosocomial spread of MDR-Gn. The heterogeneity of MS combinations and the lack of RCTs represent a major gap in the establishment of the evidence supporting the effectiveness of different MSs. Further studies are required to show how applicable are our findings to endemic and non endemic situations.M.R. Haverkate*, L.P.G. Derde, C. Brun-Buisson, M.J.M. Bonten, M.C.J. Bootsma on behalf of the MOSAR research consortium One hundred forty five unique patients colonized with AMRB had at least one readmission. When analyzing all AMRB together, 162 episodes of colonization were recorded, including episodes of colonization with two or more organisms. When split up by type of bacteria we found 107 episodes of ARGNB colonization (further divided into 42 for Escherichia coli [E. coli], 79 for Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, or Citrobacter spp. [KESC], and eight for Proteus, Providencia, and Morganella spp.[PPM]), 62 for MRSA, and 33 for VRE. Median times until decolonization were 1.2 months for all bacteria together, 1.5 months for ARGNB (<1 month for E. coli, less than one month for KESC, and not assessable for PPM), one month for MRSA, and less than one month for VRE. Duration of colonization was statistically significantly longer for KESC compared to E. coli. infection with any of the targeted CR Gram-negative pathogens. Of these infections, 52 (74.3%) occurred in patients hospitalized in the ICU. Seventy-four CR Gram-negative pathogens were identified: 20 (27.0%) A. baumannii, 13 (17.6%) P. aeruginosa, and 41 (55.4%) K. pneumoniae; 38 (92.7%) of the latter pathogens were KPC carbapenemase-producers. The incidence of infection with any of the studied pathogens was lower in the second compared with the first half of the study period for all hospitalized patients (5.These findings show that the implementation of an infection control program can reduce the incidence of infections with CR Gram-negative pathogens in our tertiary care facilities; more efforts need to be made for containing the incidence of infections with KPCproducing K. pneumoniae, which is endemic in our region. 5%) in the study population (19% for outpatients and 15% for inpatients). Four samples contained more than one ESBL-producing species, so that in total 52 ESBL-producing isolates were found. Of these, 49 were E. coli and three were Klebsiella spp. One isolate was resistant to meropenem. 35% of the ESBL positive E. coli were resistant to aminoglycosides, and 44% were resistant to ciprofloxacin. All isolates were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam.",

Studies with mAbs also revealed the existence of both protective and non-protective antibodies to fungal pathogens, which provided a possible explanation for the inconclusive results in passive-antibody experiments with immune sera. Vaccines: The scientific appeal of preventing fungal infections by vaccination is most obvious for endemic dimorphic fungi (Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides spp., H. capsulatum and P. brasiliensis) as exposures to these pathogens usually result in long-term immunity. A vaccine to prevent candidaemia has been launched recently. Prophylactic vaccines are intriguing but only offer protection against selected organisms. Rottmann M,McNamara  C, Yeung BK et al.

The presentation will summarise our current knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of rickettsioses in international travellers to the tropics. STEC) were first described as human pathogens. The characteristics of the outbreak strain, the way it spread among humans and the resulting clinical pictures have changed the way STEC are regarded as human pathogens in general. EAHEC O104:H4 and other EAHEC serotypes belong to an emerging E. coli pathotype which is endemic in Africa and has spread to Europe and Asia. Other STEC O104 strains, such as STEC O104:H2, O104:H7 and O104:H21 were implicated in outbreaks and sporadic infections of humans in different countries but these are fundamentally different from the EAHEC O104:H4 strain, as they do not possess enteroaggregative properties. EAHEC O104:H4 have evolved from enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) by uptake of an Stx2a encoding bacteriophage. No other virulence markers of classical enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) including the chromosomal locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) are present in EAHEC strains. EAHEC O104:H4 colonizes humans through AAF-pili encoded by the EAEC-plasmid. The EAHEC O104:H4 strains possess the full virulence characteristics of EAEC (aatA, aggA/agg3A, aggR, aap, set1 and pic). The AAF colonization mechanism substitutes the LEE functions for bacterial adherence and delivery of Stx2a into the human intestine resulting clinically in HUS. Humans are the only known natural reservoir for EAEC and EAHEC. In contrast, classical STEC and EHEC are associated with animals as natural hosts.Contaminated sprouted seeds produced in Northern Germany were identified as vehicle of transmission of the EAHEC O104:H4 outbreak strain. Secondary transmission of the pathogen from human to human and human to food/environment was found important. Epidemiological investigations revealed EAHEC O104:H4 contaminated fenugreek seeds as the source of entry of the agent into the food chain. However, microbiological investigations of seeds and sprouts grown from fenugreek seeds were negative. The survival of EAHEC in seeds and the frequency of human carriers of EAHEC need to be explored for a better understanding of EAHEC transmission routes.",

The major etiologic agent for HFRS in Greece is Dobrava/Belgrade virus (DOBV). The main pathophysiologic finding is increased vascular permeability. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the most potent vascular permeability agents. Aim of the study was to evaluate the levels of VEGF according to the day of illness, and the clinical course in DOBV infections. Methods: The case-controlled study included 38 serum samples from 23 HFRS patients (19 males), 17-70 years old (median 38), in whom laboratory diagnosis was set by serological and/or molecular methods. The earliest available sample was of the 5th day of the disease, and the latest of the 70th day. The patients were divided into two groups: mild/ moderate and severe disease. Samples were divided into 4 groups, according to the day of illness; A: 5-7 days, B: 8-14 days, C: 15-21, D: 22-70 days. A control group of apparently healthy individuals was included. VEGF levels were estimated using the Human Grp I cytokine 27-Plex-Panel kit in a Bio-PlexTM Suspension Array system. Mann-Whitney U-test or Kruskal-Wallis test was used to evaluate the difference between groups. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Serum VEGF levels ranged from 0 to 1340.86 pg/mL (mean 420.21, SD 319.3) and were significantly increased compared to the control group (mean 78.20, SD 34.7) (p = 0.006). VEGF levels were significantly higher in patients with hemorrhagic manifestations (r = 0.624, p = 0.002). Higher levels were also observed in patients with pulmonary involvement (r = 0.554, p = 0.014). Patients with severe clinical course presented higher VEGF levels that those with mild/moderate disease (r = 0.504, p = 0.005). Significant differences were seen in VEGF levels in groups A-D (p = 0.015). Highest VEGF levels (mean 389.49 pg/mL, SD 149.0) were observed during the 2nd week of the disease. The respective values in the 1st and 3rd week were 95.46 pg/mL (SD 174.9), and 131.85 pg/mL (SD 149.0). Levels decreased further after the 4th week (74.67 pg/mL, SD 17.7) Conclusion: Significant higher VEGF levels are observed in HFRS patients with hemorrhagic manifestations or pulmonary involvement, with highest values seen at the 2nd week of illness, suggesting that VEGF is important in HFRS pathogenesis and might be a target for the treatment of the disease.O274 An in vivo model of tick-borne encephalitis in infant rats infected with Langat virus C. Maffioli*, D. Grandgirard, O. Engler, S.L. Leib (Berne, Spiez, CH) Objectives: Tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Langat virus TP21 (LGTV) are closely related viruses within the tick-borne flaviviruses that cause menigoencephalitis in humans. TBE causes permanent neurofunctional sequelae in up to 45% of the survivors.LGTV, a naturally attenuated tick-borne flavivirus, has previously been used as a live vaccine but has been abandoned since it caused meningoencephalitis in vaccinees. The pathogenesis of TBEV and the mechanisms of brain injury underlying the neurofunctional sequelae of TBE are poorly understood and currently no effective therapy is available. Aim: To establish a rat model of TBE using Langat virus TP21 as a tool to study disease mechanisms and to develop novel treatment strategies for TBE. Methods: 11-days old Wistar rats were inoculated intracisternally with 10E6 focus forming units Langat virus or 25 mL cell supernatant. Animals were monitored for clinical symptoms of disease by assessing appearance, roaming, feeding and weight over 10 d. At 2, 4, 7 and 9 day post-infection neurofunction was scored and cerebrospinal fluid was assesed for concentration of cyto-/chemokines. At 4, 7 and 9 day after infection brains were analysed by histopathology. Results: Infection with LGTV led to menigoencephalitis including gait disturbances, hypokinesia, reduced weight gain or weight loss at 4 day p.i. Hind leg paralysis and loss of balance were evident in all (12/12) infected animals; on the rotating rod infected animals showed a significantly (p < 0.0001) higher frequency of falls within 120 seconds, and in the open field test a significantly (p < 0.05) reduced ambulatory activity compared to the controls. At 4 day p.i IFN-gamma, RANTES, IL-6 and IFN-beta were significantly increased in infected vs. control animals. Infected brains exhibited characteristic histopathological features of TBE including subarachnoid pleocytosis, perivascular cuffs and glial nodules. Immunohistochemistry documented LGTV antigen in the thalamus, basal ganglia and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum.Conclusions:The newly established rat model of LGTV-TBE mimics important clinical and histopathlogical features of human TBE and provides a tool to investigate the pathophysiology, and to develop therapeutic strategies for TBE where currently no effective treatment is available.O275 The role of viruses in the pathogenesis of peritonsillar abscess M.

Further, the widespread co-infection of HIV with HBV and syphilis alters the clinical presentation with fatal consequences. Timely effective monitoring of people with HIV is crucial both in preventing those infected from developing AIDS and in limiting onward transmissions. Currently however, HIV diagnostic tools are limited to single marker detections, laboratory-based, require the input of skilled clinical personnel and are not suitable for transportation to resource limited regions -regions where infection rates are often at their highest. There is a driving need to develop new point-of-care (POC) technologies for early diagnosis and smart patient monitoring. Directly relevant to this objective, we are developing an affordable multi-functional, realtime handheld device, similar to glucose sensor, which is capable of detecting viral multiple markers from small sample volumes (e.g. a drop of blood)",

Cameron  (Victoria, Vancouver, CA)    Objectives: To develop novel diagnostic proteins in order to enhance early detection of syphilis infections and improve overall syphilis diagnosis. Methods: Using pooled serum samples from patients infected with syphilis, immunoreactive regions of two previously identified diagnostic protein candidates, Tp0326 and Tp0453, were elucidated. Focusing on these regions, a chimeric protein construct was created. Expression conditions for Tp0326, Tp0453 and the Tp0326/Tp0453 chimeric constructs were optimized to produce soluble protein expression in Escherichia coli. To determine sensitivity these recombinant proteins were screened against serum samples from patients with primary, secondary, and latent syphilis (n = 170). To determine specificity these recombinant proteins were screened against uninfected individuals (n = 19), RPR biological false positives (n = 12), and potential cross-reactive serum (Leptospira, Borrelia burgdorferi, Helicobacter pylori, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and cytomegalovirus) (n = 38). These results were directly compared to the rapid plasma regain (RPR) test, the microhemagglutination assay for T. pallidum (MHA-TP) and the fluorescence treponemal antibody assay (FTA). Results: The sensitivities for Tp0326, Tp0453, and the Tp0326/Tp0453 chimeric protein were found to be 85%, 98% and 97% respectively. The specificity for Tp0326, Tp0453, and the Tp0326/Tp0453 chimeric protein were found to be 99%, 100% and 99% respectively.

Interventions: Between the first quarters (Q1) of 2008 and 2011 the clinical microbiology team at Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust undertook multiple primary care antimicrobial stewardship interventions.This comprised: monthly consultant microbiologist/general practitioners ''bridging the gap'' lunch time study sessions involving educational content delivery followed by prescriber led-discussion/questions; microbiologist led rootcause analysis of all C. difficile infections across primary care and acute trust; introduction of a revised comprehensive primary care antimicrobial formulary; engagement with community pharmacy and infection control staff in ''Whole Health Economy'' meetings; an increasing volume of telephone consultations with primary care clinicians; GP trainees in hospital posts taking on leadership of antimicrobial stewardship audits; and an open invite to relevant primary care staff to the hospital antimicrobial and infection control committee meetings. The proportion of total antibacterial prescriptions that were for quinolones, cephalosporins or co-amoxiclav was assessed at the start and end of the period. A basic regression analysis was used to look for a significant downward trend. Results: The proportion of total antibacterial prescriptions made up of these three high risk agents decreased from 16% in Q1 2008 to 9% in Q1 2011 (p \u2021 0.001). No other confounding variables during the same period accounting for this proportionate reduction were identified.

Bryson on behalf of the Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group Objective: To utilise quantitative and qualitative data on antibiotic prescribing to develop a quality indicator. Methods: The Prescribing Information System for Scotland (PRISMS) provides quantitative analysis of antibiotic use in primary care at national, NHS board and GP Practice level. In 2011 a study involving General Practitioners was carried out to collect data about all consultations for acute infections during a one week period. The findings of this study were used along with data from PRISMS to develop a proposal for a national quality indicator. The proposal was accepted by the national Primary Care Leads group and was submitted to Scottish Government for implementation in April 2012. Results: In 2010 the overall use of systemic antibacterials expressed as number of items per 1000 population per day was 1.9% lower than in 2009, the second successive annual reduction. Qualitative analysis of antibiotic prescribing by 99 GPs from 55 Practices and across 13 of the 14 NHS boards in Scotland showed: o In 68% of consultations a prescription for an antibiotic was issued. o Upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) accounted for >60% of prescriptions. o Approximately half of those with an URTI received an antibiotic and use of delayed prescriptions was low. The focus for the quality indicator was agreed as reduction of total antibacterial use. Antibiotic prescribing across GP practices in Scotland during 2010-11 ranged from 0.7 to 4.0 items/1000 patients/day with a mean number of items of 1.99 items/1000 patients/day. The SAPG proposal translates into a ''best in class'' standard of 1.66 items/1000 patients/day. To facilitate introduction of the quality indicator SAPG has developed a toolkit including: o Review of the evidence for antibiotic use in URTI and alternative management strategies oAn editable poster version of primary care antibiotic guidance for local adaptation oConsultation aids o A summary of resources available for Continuing Professional Development oInformation for patients on URTI o Audit tool for qualitative evaluation of practice with real time reportingConclusion: National quantitative information and baseline qualitative information on the use of antibiotics in a sample of GPs across Scotland have been used to evaluate prescribing practice in primary care. We have identified overprescribing of antibiotics for URTI as a potential area for quality improvement and this is being implemented as a national prescribing indicator to reduce antibiotic use.O295 Utility of LightCycler SeptiFast test for the detection of polymicrobial newborn sepsis in low draw volume of blood G.

An Emax model with variable slope was used to fit response data (Graphpad Prism 5.0). Results: Data from 89 patients were available for NONMEM modelling. A two-compartment model best fit the data with creatinin clearance as a covariate on clearance and age on the central compartment. Using the model and the MICs of the GN, the %fT>MIC was estimated for 154 patients in the NP study. CART analysis showed a breakpoint value of 44.9% (p < 0.0001) for GN pathogens. The Emax model showed a good fit (R2 = 0.93). The benefit of adequate treatment increased from an eradication rate of 0.48 at %fT>MIC of 0% to 0.99 at 100%, respectively. The EC50 was 46.8% and the EC90 was 74.1%fT>MIC. Conclusion: Analysis of a large phase three nosocomial pneumonia study showed that microbiological outcome at EOT in patients treated with CAZ was significantly associated with exposure. A high probability of microbiological eradication was attained at values above 44.9%fT>MIC. These clinical data concur with values observed in preclinical models and underscore the need for adequate exposures in clinical patients.O298 A cohort study comparing outcomes of extended-infusion doripenem to standard infusion imipenem for patients with invasive Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections D.

The Antimicrobial Stewardship Program (ASP) evaluated the clinical outcomes of extended-infusion doripenem compared to 30 minute infusions of imipenem for patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia or pneumonia.Methods: Adult patients with a blood culture and or BAL > 10 000 CFU/mL for P. aeruginosa who received standard infusion imipenem (0.5 g IV over 30 minutes every 6 hours) from Oct-July 2010, were compared to extended infusion doripenem(0.5 g IV over 4 hours every 8 hours) from Oct-July 2011. Demographic characteristics, Charlson score, mechanical ventilator days, ICU admission, ICU length of stay (LOS), infection related LOS mortality, and hospital costs, were compared. p-values were determined by Fisher's exact or Wilcoxon ranksum test as appropriate. All values are presented as number or percent or median (IQR) as appropriate. Results: One hundred sixteen patients were identified for inclusion. A trend towards fewer ICU and ventilator days, shorter LOS, lower mortality and hospital costs favored extended infusion doripenem.

Methods: A recently published voriconazole population pharmacokinetic model fitted to data from 64 healthy volunteers and patients was used as a Bayesian prior for the controller. The ability of the model to track individual patients was assessed in 10 HSCT patients receiving a standard voriconazole regimen.

Environmental contamination with VRE and ESBL is less common. Sampling times were not related to cleaning schedules therefore we have not determined if the high rate of isolation of MRSA is related primarily to more intense shedding or longer persistence in the environment.O301 The effect of hospital effluent on antimicrobial-resistant E. coli within a municipal wastewater system S.

E. faecalis was mainly found in samples from TRA-A, both in winter and summer (55% of the isolates). In TRA-B, E. hirae was predominant in winter (72%) and E. 55%) was detected. Enterococci resistant to \u20212AB were found in 90% of the samples, including water/sediments collected upstream TRA, feed and fish. CuR genes, tcrB or cueO, were identified in 12% and 8% of the isolates tested, mostly feed, fish tanks water/sediments, water leaking TRA and only in a single E. faecalis from river water upstream of TRA-B. They often carried resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin, streptomycin or chloramphenicol. The vanA/B; ermA/C; tetO/K; cfr, aac(6)-Ib/Ic/Id genes weren't found. Conclusion: Fish raised in free-AB TRA are either colonized or in contact with Enterococcus resistant to copper and AB used in human medicine, through contaminated river water and feed. Feed containing Cu might select ABR genes located in the same genetic element. Multiresistant genetic platforms (plasmids, transposons, clones) can be spread to humans through the food chain or secondary routes from the contaminated environment.O303Biocide susceptibility among clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates T.

Coque and the BIOHYPO Consortium (Madrid, ES; Lisbon, PT; London, UK; Brussels, BE) Objectives: Biocides are widely used in hospitals and community settings to control microbial growth, however, susceptibility of well characterized bacterial pathogens against these compounds has scarcely been studied. This study evaluates the activity of commonly used biocides among human Enterobacteriaceae of different species. Methods: Five hundred thirty-five Enterobacteriaceae isolates (372 Escherichia coli of phylogroups A, B1, B2 and D, 60 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 48 Salmonella spp., 55 Enterobacter spp 1988-2011) from different origins (mainly urine, blood and feces) with different phenotypes (178 ESBL, 4 KPC, 353 non-ESBL isolates) of representative widespread clones (MLST, PFGE, phylogroups) were evaluated. Susceptibility against antibiotics and biocides including triclosan (TRI), chlorhexidine (CHX), benzalkonium chloride (BKC) and sodium hypochlorite (SHC) were determined by broth microdilution method following CLSI guidelines using appropriate control strains. Results: MIC and MBC (mg/L) unimodal distributions were observed for all biocides analyzed, values varying 1-3 fold among species: TRI, MIC50/90 = 0.06-0.25/0.12-1 and MBC50 = 1; CHX, MIC50/ /L and MBC50 = 32768-65536. E. coli was the most susceptible species to all compounds analyzed. Within E. coli, isolates of phylogroups A and B1 showed slightly higher MIC/MBC to TRI, BZC and CHX than D or B2 strains. Other species differed in MIC/MBC values to BZC (Salmonella > Enterobacter > Klebsiella), CHX (Salmonella > Enterobacter = Klebsiella) or TRI (Klebsiella > Enterobacter > Salmonella). Three isolates, 1 A0-E. coli (linked to cryptic lineages), one D E. coli, and 1 Enterobacter cloacae showed reduced susceptibility to TRI (MIC > 16 mg/L). Correlation between low susceptibility against biocides and antibiotic resistance was not established. Conclusion: This work constitutes one of the first reports addressing biocide susceptibility against different species of Enterobacteriaceae which may contribute to establish epidemiological cut off values (ECOFFs) of biocides for these microorganisms. Predominant unimodal distributions for all compounds analyzed indicate that biocide resistance remains uncommon among clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates, but the application of these compounds might change the populational proportions of Enterobacteriaceae species in the environment, and occasionally give rise to resistant variants O304 Antibiotic-resistance and virulence profiles in bacterial strains isolated from wastewater treatment plants and receiving waters in Romania",

The regression analysis showed the best responses of combination regimens by the sum AUC0-24 > MIC of the single-agent regimens with r 2 = 0.39 and 0.43 for VCZ-susceptible and VCZresistant isolates respectively, indicating that in vivo combinations of VCZ + AFG were significantly synergism. Conclusion: We conclude that the PDIs of VCZ and AFG can be used as predictive of outcome for single agents and also combination therapy. When given in combination, there appears to be a degree of synergism independent of the dosing regimen applied. This study shows that synergistic therapeutic efficacy of VCZ + AFG was dependent on the exposure of two drugs, in a non-neutropenic murine model of resistant-IA.O306 Pharmacodynamic effects of antifungal agents on biofilms of Aspergillus fumigatus strains isolated from cystic fibrosis patients M. Simitsopoulou*, E. Tasina, E. Roilides (Thessaloniki, GR) Objectives: A. fumigatus colonizes the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients forming biofilms (BF) and causing allergic or invasive aspergillosis. We aimed to study the BF-forming capacity of A. fumigatus isolated from sputa of CF or non-CF patients and the susceptibility of the BF to amphotericin B (AMB), voriconazole (VRC) and micafungin (MFG). We additionally compared these results to those against A. fumigatus planktonic (PL) cells. Methods: A. fumigatus BF were produced by incubating 10^6 conidia/ mL in RPMI, pH 7.2, at 37\u00b0C for 24 hour. BF production was evaluated by safranin staining and absorbance measuring at 492 nm. BF were incubated with no drug or with AMB, VRC or MFG at 0.015-128, 0.007-128, and 0.0035-128 mg/L, respectively at 37\u00b0C for 24 hour. BF MICs were determined as >50% BF damage compared to controls, using the XTT assay. PL MICs were determined according to the CLSI M38-A method. The concentrations used in evaluating PL MICs were: AMB, 0.03-16; VRC, 0.007-128; MFG, 0.0035-32 mg/L. The damages of CF biofilms were compared to non-CF biofilms by one-way ANOVA (3 independent experiments), Bonferroni post-test (p < 0.05). Results: PL cells of all isolates were susceptible to all agents (PLMIC50 of AMB, VRC and MFG: 0.5, 0.06 and 0.03 mg/L for CF vs. 0.25, 0.015 and 0.007 mg/L for non-CF isolates). BF of both CF and non-CF strains appeared to be susceptible to AMB with BFMIC50 comparable to those of PL cells (1.41 for BF vs. 0.56 mg/L for PL of CF strains, p = 0.057; 1.33 for BF vs. 0.71 mg/L for PL of non-CF M.

Quigley, M. Ramsay, S. Ijaz (London, UK)Objectives: The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive molecular epidemiological investigation of acute hepatitis B infections throughout England and Wales as part of the enhanced surveillance at microbiological services, HPA. The knowledge of genotype distribution and phylogenetic analysis of acute HBV infections can assist in the surveillance of this disease, tracking of transmission and prediction of the future disease burden. Methods: Serum samples from acute hepatitis B infected individuals were collected from across England and Wales from 2009 to 2011. PCR and sequencing of the surface, X, precore and core regions of HBV was undertaken in order to determine the genotype distribution, perform phylogenetic analysis and detect the presence of any clinically significant mutations. Epitope mapping of the surface antigen region was carried out and samples were also screened for the presence of delta virus. Results: Of the 481 patients identified with an acute HBV infection 44% had a genotype A infection, 2.5% genotype B, 16% genotype C, 28% genotype D, 7% genotype E, 1% genotype F, 0.5% genotype G and 0.5% genotype H. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of a number of clusters within this group of patients. Sequence analysis of the HBV virus identified the presence of clinically significant mutations in this group of samples. Among the mutations identified there were those in the ''a'' determinant of the HBsAg which are possibly associated with antibody escape and one occurrence of an established anti viral resistance profile in the overlapping polymerase gene. Clinically significant mutations were also found in the precore and X regions of the genome.Conclusion: This study is currently the most comprehensive overview of the molecular epidemiology of acute hepatitis B infections in England and Wales. It is also the first study to have identified the presence of clinically significant mutations in acute infections, to have phenotyped these mutations and to have screened a large group of acute hepatitis B acute infections for the presence of delta virus. O593 Hepatitis B virus reactivation: a heterogeneous entity D. Seixas*, C. Nazareth, B. Pereira, N. Marques, L. Malcata, E. Ferreira, J.E. Serra, J.G. Saraiva da Cunha (Coimbra, PT) Background: In the last years natural history of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection has been clarified. It is now understood that HBV remains in the host's Genoma even after viral clearance. Under immunosuppressive conditions the virus might became replicative, leading both to asymptomatic liver function test abnormalities or lethal acute liver failure. HBV screening should therefore be universal in every immunocompromised patients, though, which of them should undergo prophylaxis it is not yet consensual. Method: Reactivation of Hepatitis B was defined as the recurrence or a sudden rise in this virus replication, accompanied by an increase in serum transaminase levels in patients with previous inactive or occult hepatitis B infection. The authors performed a retrospective study, concerning patients referred to the Infectious Disease Department between years 2004 and 2011 with HBV reactivation during an immunosuppressive condition and who did not underwent appropriated prophylaxis. Results: The authors identified eight caucasian Portuguese patients (four males and four females), median age 64 years old. All had evidence of past infection (HBcAb positive) and two were HBsAb positive.Five had hematological malignancies receiving chemotherapy; one had a bone sarcoma and another was a heart transplant recipient. The other patient was HIV-C3 positive and he was lost to follow-up after 1 month of therapeutics. Four patients were HBsAg negative before chemotherapy, which became positive afterwards; from these patients two had HBsAb positive before immunosuppressive drugs. Both of them received Rituximab as part of the treatment for their underlying condition. A median increase of ALT levels of twenty folds normal was registered, but this value returned under the normal cut-off in all patients after treatment was started. The therapeutics used for HBV reactivation was 3TC in five patients, TDF+FTC in two patients and Entecavir in the other. Treatment was stopped in two patients and it is still kept in the others (median duration 2.7 years). Conclusion: In spite of routine prophylaxis being consensually given only to HBsAg positive persons, results suggest that all patients with evidence of past HBV infection are potential candidates for preimmunossupression prophylaxis. Appropriate surveillance and selected intervention and may offer improved patient survival as well as limiting associated morbidity.O594 A decade (2001-2011) of liver transplantation in HIVsubjects with HCV cirrhosis in the haart era: coinfection does not lead to reduced survival in the first 5 years A.

Barcena (Madrid, ES) Objectives: To assess the impact of HIV-coinfection on overall outcomes and independent predictors of mortality in all consecutive hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhotic subjects undergoing liver transplantation (LT) at a Reference Center from January 2001 to November 2011 (N = 195) Methods: Descriptive statistics of baseline features and univariate and Cox-regression analyses of independent predictors of mortality.Results: HIV+ subjects accounted for 12% of LT (n = 23). They were younger (45 \u00b1 6 vs. 52 \u00b1 9 years, p = 0.0001), with less frequency of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as the indication for LT (30% vs. 54%, p = 0.03), and showed a higher rate of HCV/HBV coinfection (26% vs. 4%, p = 0.001). There were no differences in the distribution of HCV genotypes (G1 or G4 77% vs. 84%, p = 0.37), nor in the MELD scores at LT: overall 18 \u00b1 7 vs. 16 \u00b1 6 (p = 0.24), 20 \u00b1 7 vs.19 \u00b1 5 if excluded HCC (p = 0.78). Mean times on wating list (WL) were also similar (179 \u00b1 138 vs. 246 \u00b1 228 days, p = 0.17), with a trend to a shorter time on WL in HIV+ subjects if excluded patients with HCC: 152 \u00b1 137 vs. 278 \u00b1 280 days, p = 0.08. Prevalences of donor/ recipient CMV missmatch were also similar: 9% vs. 6% (p = 0.95). To date, median time of follow-up is 700 days (0-3784), and HIV+ subjects showed similar rates of early mortality (<90 days after LT), retrasplantation, acute rejection, or CMV infection: 4% vs. 12% (p = 0.48), 4% vs. 6% (p = 1), 22% vs. 33% (p = 0.27), 43% vs. 27% (p = 0.11), as well as a similar median time to CMV infection (26 vs. 42 days). After Cox-regression, independent predictors of mortality after LT were a higher MELD score at LT (HR 1.054; 95%CI 1.008-1.102, p = 0.022), CMV infection (HR 2.319; 95%CI 1.347-3.992, p = 0.002), and older age (HR 1.043; 95%CI 1.012-1.074, p = 0.006). Overall, HIV-subjects had similar cumulative survival at 1, 3 and 5 years: 95% vs. 85%; 78% vs. 71%; 65% vs. 60% (p = 0.42), and similar rates of severe HCV recurrence (13% in both groups), HCVrelated death (60% (3/6) vs. 46% (23/50), p = 0.6), or peg-IFN/RBV use (35% in both groups). Conclusion: in HCV cirrhotic subjects undergoing LT, HIVcoinfection did not worsen outcomes within the first 5 years. Mortality was associated to older age, higher MELD scores at LT and CMV infection.

Beslen on behalf of the Chronic Hepatitis C Study Group* Objective: To evaluate the relationship between liver biopsy and noninvasive biochemical methods in determination of liver fibrosis based on biochemical and haematological parameters in treatment naive chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. Methods: A total of 185 treatment naive CHC patients were included in this multicentre, open label, non-interventional, observational study conducted in 31 outpatient clinics of Infectious Diseases Departments at universities and Sections at governmental hospitals all over Turkey.During 12-month study period, comparisons of liver fibrosis scores obtained via liver biopsy (Metavir scoring system) and noninvasive biochemical methods (Fibrotest, APRI, Forns index) were performed, based on biochemical (albumin, total protein, alpha 2-macroglobulin, haptoglobulin, apolipoprotein A1, total bilirubin, Mean (SD) age of the cohort was (49.9 (11.4) years); and there was a slight female (58.9%) predominance. Liver biopsy was performed in all patients, whereas non-invasive biochemical methods were performed in 145 patients. Metavir fibrosis scoring of liver biopsy specimens revealed identification of F0 in 28,2%, F1-F2 in 41,5%, F3 in 16,9%, and F4 in 13,4% of patients. As a non-invasive biochemical fibrosis marker, Fibrotest results revealed identification of F0 in 28.3%, F1-F2 in 42.1%, F3 in 16.6% and F4 in 13.1% of patients. There were significant correlations between Metavir fibrosis Conclusion: In conclusion, our findings indicate the efficacy of Fibrotest, APRI and Forns index noninvasive biochemical markers to be similar to biopsy related Metavir scores in determination of liver fibrosis in treatment naive chronic hepatitis C patientsO596 Incidence of end stage liver disease and causes of deaths in a cohort of HIV/HCV-infected patients in France: HEPAVIH ANRS C013 E. Pambrun*, M.A. Loko, M. Winnock, P. Sogni, K. Lacombe, P. Morlat, F. Dabis, D. Salmon on behalf of Hepavih Arns C013 Background: The HEPAVIH ANRS C013', implemented in 2005 aimed at describing the natural history of HIC/HCV coinfection in france.Methods: The study involved 1175 patients followed for a median duration of 38 months. Fibrosis stage was evaluated by liver biopsy or fibroscan, or fibrotest. For incidence of end stage liver disease (ESLD), the study focused on HIV/HCV-coinfected patients without decompensated cirrhosis or HCC at inclusion. Fibrosis stage was evaluated using an algorithm combining liver biopsy and non-invasive liver fibrosis tests. Time from enrollment to the first liver decompensation, HCC or death was reported as function of fibrosis stage at enrolment. The causes of death were validated by an expert committee.Results: Incidence of events was clearly dependent of fibrosis stage. In patients with HIV/HCV and cirrhosis, the incidence rate of ESLD or HCC was 2.6% at 1 year, 6.1% at 2 years, 9.1% at 3 years, 10.0% at 4 years, 10.8% at 5 years. 68 deaths were notified. The causes of death were unknown in 8,6% (n = 6) of the notified cases. Among those with documented causes of death, the main underlying causes were: liverrelated (42.9%, hepatocellular carcinoma: 27%), cancer not related to AIDS or hepatitis (11.4%), cardiovascular disease (8.6%), AIDS-related (8.6%), other infections (10%), overdose (4.3%) and suicide (2,9%).. Mortality incidence at 5 years was much higher in cirrhotic patients.Conclusions: Although liver related deaths remain the most important cause of deaths in HIV/HVC coinfected patients, cancers and cardiovascular diseases are becoming increasing causes of deaths. Besides the treatment of HCV, this needs implementation of specific measures of screening and management of cancer and cardiovascular risk in HIV/HCV coinfected patients. and therapy of MRSA infection O597 Nosocomial transmission of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Danish hospitals D.J. Hetem*, H. Westh, K. Boye, J.O. Jarl\u00f8v, M.J.M. Bonten, M.C.J. Bootsma (Utrecht, NL; Copenhagen, DK) Objective: The emergence of community-associated methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has changed the epidemiology of MRSA infections worldwide. In contrast to hospitalassociated MRSA (HA-MRSA), CA-MRSA more frequently affects healthy individuals, both with and without recent healthcare exposure. Despite obvious epidemiological differences, it is unknown whether differences in nosocomial transmissibility exist. We have, therefore, quantified transmissibility, expressed by the single admission reproduction number, RA, of CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA in hospital settings in Denmark. Methods: MRSA index cases and secondary cases were investigated in four hospitals in the Copenhagen area. Index cases were defined as nonisolated, non-screened patients with MRSA, and secondary cases were defined as persons carrying MRSA isolates -identical to that of the corresponding index -as identified through contact screening. CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA were categorized upon genotyping (CA-MRSA: t008-ST8, PVL+; t019-ST30, PVL+; t127-ST1, PVL+; t044-ST80, PVL+ and their related spa-types; HA-MRSA: all other). A mathematical model based on the queueing theory was applied to determine the genotype-specific transmission rate (RA) of CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA strains. Results: During the 7 year study period there were 117 MRSA-index cases with subsequent post-contact screenings (of 1108 patients and healthcare workers), revealing 22 outbreaks with a total of 52 secondary patients. RA values were 0.07 (95% CI 0.00-0.28) and 0.65 (95% CI 0.48-0.84) for CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA, respectively. Conclusion: In four Danish hospitals the nosocomial transmission rate of CA-MRSA was 9.3 times lower than that of HA-MRSA. A. Shoyinka*, S. Arshad, D. Moreno, A. Chen, M. Zervos (Detroit, US)Objectives: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are associated with a severe necrotizing syndromes and high mortality. It accounts for 20%-40% of all hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There is insufficient data on comparative outcomes by molecular characteristics in MRSA isolates in pneumonia patients. Earlier noncomparative studies in USA600 MRSA bacteremia patients have shown a 50% mortality rate due to this organism. The purpose of this study is to compare clinical outcomes of patients with the CDC USA600 (ST45) MRSA strain vs. those patients with the USA100 (ST5) strain type in MRSA pneumonia. Methods: This is a retrospective case control study done in a 900 bed urban hospital in Detroit, Michigan from July 2005 to December 2009 of consecutive patients with MRSA pneumonia. Patients were identified through review of microbiology laboratory records. Medical history, risk factors, antibiotic exposure and outcome were obtained by chart review. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of SmaI-digested genomic DNA was performed on all isolates using a CHEF-DR III (BioRad). PFGE patterns were compared using BioNumerics software (Applied Maths). Results: Two hundred and twenty-one 221 consecutive MRSA pneumonia patients were evaluable for an all-cause 30-day mortality outcome. The prevalence by CDC group was 11% (24 patients) USA600, and 59% (131 patients) USA100. There was no significant difference in age amongst the USA600 vs. the USA100 patients; the mean age was 71 \u00b1 14.4 and 64 \u00b1 17.1, respectively. The distribution by gender was as follows: 79% males, 21% females within the USA600 cohort, and 61% males, 39% females in the USA100 cohort. All cause 30 day mortality was seen in 33% of all patients; within the USA600 group, 46% (11 pts) and within the USA100 group, 34% (44) pts died (p = 0.249). Conclusions: Although there is no statistically significant difference in mortality observed amongst the patients by strain type, the mortality rate is still quite high. Future studies are necessary to evaluate the relationship of molecular characteristics of MRSA isolates with patientrelated factors in MRSA pneumonia. O599 A retrospective study of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia: correlating vancomycin MIC to clinical outcomes Q.D. Dinh*, T. Wong, S. Champagne, MG Romney, N. Press (Vancouver, CA) Objectives: At our institution, which serves an inner-city population, there is a high incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia. Previous data have suggested vancomycin ''MIC creep'', but it is unclear if elevated MIC levels are associated with mortality (indicating treatment failure) in patients who are bacteraemic with MRSA. We examined factors associated with vancomycin MIC, and correlates with mortality. Methods: A retrospective study of adults with MRSA bacteraemia at St. Paul's Hospital from June 2006 to June 2009 was performed by standardized chart review. MICs for vancomycin(vMIC)and daptomycin (dMIC) were determined using Etest methodology for the first isolate for each episode. The analysis group was stratified into three groups by vMIC \u00a30.75 mg/L (n = 51), 1.0 mg/L (n = 99), and \u20211.5 mg/L (n = 50). Variables associated with vMIC were determined using chi-square test, and correlated to mortality using chi-square test, t-test, and logistic regression. Results: Complete MIC results were available for 200 of 244 episodes of MRSA bacteraemia, comprising 192 patients. The median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 38-59 years); injection drug use (IDU) was associated with 50.5% of episodes; and 26% of patients had HIV/AIDS. The most common related diagnoses were complicated skin and soft tissue infection (21%), pneumonia (18.5%), probable or definite infective endocarditis(17%),haematogenousboneandjoint infections(14.5%),and catheter-related bacteraemia (9.5%). The 30-day mortality rate was 13%.",

Pujol on behalf of the MRSA study groups REIPI/GEIH Objectives: To evaluate the risk factors for infective endocarditis (IE) among a large cohort of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia, taking into account clinical and microbiological identifiers as well as antibiotic therapy. Methods: Prospective cohort study from Ju-2008 to December-2009 among 21 Spanish hospitals. All episodes of MRSA bacteremia were included. Demographic and clinical information were recorded and strains were studied in a central lab, including antibiotic susceptibility and molecular characterization. Ecocardiography was necessary for the diagnostic of IE, which was the dependent variable in a logistic regression model. Results: Five hundred and eighty-three episodes were included, 32 (5%) were diagnosed with IE. Localization: Mi: 17 (53%), Ao 8 (28%), Tr/Pul 4 (13%). Prosthetic IE: 7 (22%). 5 (16%) IE on pacemaker. Isolates vancomycin and daptomycin MIC90 were 1 and 0.5 ug/mL. Pulse-type 2 observed in 77% of the isolates (agr2, MLST125), LPV genes were not harbored by any of IE episodes isolates. Appropriate initial antibiotic therapy (first 48 hours): 26 (84%). Antibiotic therapy duration (mean, range): 42 days (9-65 day). Surgery on the infected valve(s) needed in 10 patients. Complications and outcome: distant hematogenous seeeding 10 (31%). Blood cultures were sterilized (mean) in 9 days (SD 6.6 day). Persistent bacteremia observed in 15 (56%)episodes. 30-day mortality: 17 (53%). 1 relapse was observed. Risk factors for IE were Pitt score >3 (OR 3.33 [1.08-10.3]), unknown portal of entry (OR 24.21 [6.67-87.9]), distant hematogenous seeeding (OR 42.58 [11.68-155]) and foreign bodies presence (OR 3.57 [1.07-12.0]). Conclusion: IE incidence among MRSA bacteremia is high, and is related to the severity of sepsis, distant hematogenous seeeding,foreign bodies presence and absence of known portal of entry. Overall mortality was also high in our cohort of patients. O601 MRsA decolonisation: success rate, risk factors for failure and duration of follow-up in a low-prevalence setting P. Kohler*, A. Bregenzer-Witteck, G. Rettenmund, S. Daneel, M. Schlegel (St. Gallen, CH) Objective: MRSA decolonization is a widely established, though controversial part of many MRSA controlling strategies. In our institution, a 700 bed tertiary hospital in Eastern Switzerland with low MRSA prevalence (2.6% of isolates), we aimed to evaluate our decolonization success rate, to identify risk factors for decolonization failure and to determine the optimal duration of follow-up. Methods: We included all patients with newly detected MRSA colonization or infection between 01/2007 and 12/2009. Decolonization is initiated shortly after MRSA detection or after loss of temporary risk factors for decolonization failure, such as open wounds or ongoing antibiotic treatment. Patients with persistent risk factors or non-adherence are usually not decolonized. Decolonizationconsists of nasal mupirocin ointment, chlorhexidine mouth rinse and whole body wash with didecyldimonium chloride for 5 days. Systemic antibiotics are usually not added to the regimen. Control swabs are taken around month 1, 3, 6 and 12 after decolonization. Successful decolonization was assumed for patients with at least one negative control swab and no further positive swabs thereafter. MRSA failure was defined as persistent positivity after decolonization or MRSA recurrence (positive swab after at least one negative swab). Every patient with failure enters a new decolonization cycle. The time interval from the start of the first decolonization to the day of the last available swab was defined as follow-up period.Results: Out of 78 MRSA positive patients, 51 (65%) underwent decolonization. The decolonization success rate was 65% (33/51) after a mean of 1.4 decolonization cycles (median follow-up 13 months). Besides colonization of the respiratory tract (OR 9.1; CI 1.2-66.7), isolation of a certain MRSA subtype (OR 5.8; CI 1.0-33.3) was found to be the most important risk factor for decolonization failure(Figure). 88% of episodes with MRSA recurrence (14/16) were detected within 270 days after decolonization.Conclusion: Without the routine use of oral antibiotics, high MRSA decolonization success rates can be achieved. A time period of 1 year after decolonization seems to be a reasonable duration of follow-up in our setting. We encourage other institutions to take into account local MRSA epidemiology (e.g. predominance of certain subtypes) for the management of MRSA patients. efficiency of molecular techniques S604 PCR for early diagnosis of invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients: Where are we?L.

For Old World localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL), the main treatment remains pentavalent antimonial agents given intralesionally \u00b1 cryotherapy. Topical treatment with paromycine ointment could be an option in L. tropica. Pentavalent antimonials are the drug of choice for New World LCL. Nonetheless, liposomal amphotericine B, pentamidine isethionate and miltefosine could be attractive alternatives according to the culprit species. In case of acute schistosomiasis praziquantel does not prevent the chronic phase of the disease and is associated with exacerbation of signs in approximately 50% of cases. Corticosteroids may be recommended in severe forms. The most convenient treatment of Hookworm related cutaneous larva migrans is one single dose of ivermectin (200 mg/kg bodyweight) (cure rates: 94-100%). Oral or topical albendazole is another option. Presumptive treatment for strongyloidiasis (in case of corticosteroid therapy in migrants and travellers) should be ivermectin (200 mcg/kg) for 2 days or repeated 2 weeks later. Oral albendazole (400-800 mg/ day, at least for 3 days) is as an option. Treatments for neurocysticercosis include praziquantel and albendazole. Eradication of Taenia solium may also need treatment of tapeworm carriers with niclosamide (2 grams) or praziquantel (5 mg/kg). Corticosteroids are indicated in situations at risk of severe complication (ocular cysticercosis, ventricular cysts or diffuse brain infections). Treatments for gnathostomiasis are albendazole (400-800 mg per day for 21 days) (cure rates : 78.5-94%) and ivermectin (0.2 mg/kg for 2 days)(cure rates : 100%).

Rodr\u00edguez-Ba\u00f1o* (Seville, ES)Although bloodstream infections (BSI) include a heterogeneous collection of infection types caused by a variety of microorganisms, there are some clear advantages of using them as a priority for quality of care programs in the area of infectious diseases and antimicrobial use. First, BSIs are associated with important morbidity and mortality, and the incidence of BSI has been increasing during last decades. Second, indications for performing blood cultures are similar in most hospitals, and etiologic diagnosis is available by definition, and making BSI a good model for observational investigation on the clinical impact of antibiotic resistance and of antimicrobial treatment. Third, some aspects of the clinical management are common among all patients with BSI. And fourth, programs aimed at improving the earlier adequate management of BSI have been shown to improve outcomes. We have recently proposed some indicators of structure, processes, and outcome that might be useful to evaluate the quality of care for patients with BSI. Although some available data may be used for preliminary benchmarking, more studies are needed. Additionally, data on BSI may serve as indicators for evaluating other programs, such as those directed to improving the management of sepsis, or local protocols for antimicrobial use. The implementation of activities aimed at improving the management and outcome of patients with BSI should be a priority for Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology services in all hospitals. Such activities should ideally be performed in collaboration by welltrained microbiologists and infectologists under a structured program including early reporting of preliminary and definitive results, active offering for specialised clinical management advice and follow-up, educational activities, and feed-back.C. Caneiras*, F. Calisto, G. Da Silva, L. Lito, J. Melo Cristino, A. Duarte (Lisbon, Coimbra, PT)Objectives: We conducted a surveillance study of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates in order to investigate the KPC-3 carbapenemase dissemination in Portugal.Methods: A PCR-based, hospital surveillance study of carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriacea isolates was conducted in Portugal from January 2010 to July 2011 in a tertiary care Group of Hospitals, in Lisbon. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion method and interpreted following the CLSI. The presence of genes encoding metallo-beta-lactamases (IMP, VIM, NDM), KPC-type and OXA-48 and others ESBL enzymes were screened by PCR method using specific primers. All amplified products were then subjected to direct nucleotide sequencing. Results: Since the first description in Portugal in 2009, 43 unique and multi-resistant isolates were identified. 48% of the isolates were from surgical wards, 21% from intensive and intermediary care units and 9% from surgical outpatients follow-up. The KPC-3 carbapenemase was detected in all carbapenems-resistant isolates (n = 43), namely: 31 K. pneumoniae, seven K. oxytoca, two Enterobacter aerogenes, two Escherichia coli and one Citrobacter freundi. The blaKPC-3 gene is part of a plasmid associated to Tn4401 however different genetic environments especially for Enterobacter aerogenes and E. coli isolates were found. The E. aerogenes isolates harbour KPC-3 and TEM-type although E. coli and C. freundi simultaneously showed KPC-3+TEM-type+SHV-type. A combination of different ESBL genes was found to KPC-producing K. pneumoniae, namely: KPC-3+TEM-To our knowledge, is the first report of Citrobacter freundi isolate KPC-3 producer in Portugal and a novel association of KPC-3 with DHA in Klebsiella oxytoca. These results suggest a diversity and widespread dissemination of the KPC-3 gene in clinically significant nosocomial isolates. Therefore, prompt detection of carbapenemases-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates, active antibiotic resistance surveillance, and strict implementation of infection control measures in surgical wards are critical to avoid the spread of these isolates.O623 Molecular characterisation and epidemiology ofKlebsiella pneumoniae KPC-3 producers isolated in Rome, Italy A.

The aim of the study was to fully characterize the carbapenem resistant KP strains. Methods: From February to June 2011, 103 KP strains with ertapenem MIC \u20211 mg/L were isolated from 101 patients and screened for carbapenemase production by the modified Hodge test, PCRsequencing of carbapenemase and ESBL genes, plasmid replicons, and OmpK35, OmpK36 porin variants. Genetic relatedness of isolates was determined by PFGE and MLST.

Carmeli (Tel-Aviv, IL)Objectives: Our aims were (i) to examine the duration of carriage of KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC KP) following hospital discharge, (ii) to study the risk factors for persistent carriage and (iii) to investigate transmission to family members. Methods: A cohort of KPC KP carriers were followed monthly between 3 and 6 months after discharge from an acute-care hospital. Rectal sample and data were collected at baseline and at each visit. Family members and caregivers in the same household were also tested by rectal samples. KPC KP was detected by culture and direct blaKPC PCR. Acquisition time was regarded as the earliest date of KPC KP isolation. Resolution of carriage was defined as a negative KPC KP tests in at-least two consecutive samples. Analyses were separated for recent (<3 months) (REC) and remote (>3 months) (REM) acquisition groups. Risk factors for persistent carriage were examined by survival analyses (log rank test) for the REC group and by the Chi-square and ttest for the REM group. Results: A total of 125 patients were included, 75 and 50 in the REC and REM groups, respectively. The mean (SD) age of patients was 67.5 (19.3) years and 49.6% were males. The numbers (%) of persistent carriers were 46 (61%) and 14 (28%) in the REC and REM group, respectively (p < 0.001). Significant risk factors for persistent carriage identified in both the REC and REM groups were the presence of any catheter and a low functional status (Barthel index) score (p < 0.05). Unique risk factors identified in the REC group included the use of antibiotics during the month prior to study entry (p = 0.053), longer hospitalization (p = 0.043), admission from a long-term care facility (LTCF) (p = 0.001) and a discharge from acute care to LTCF (p = 0.002). Out of the entire 100 patients who had at least one negative sample, only 65 remained negative. Family members and caregivers (n = 32) were followed for up to 3 months with 102 rectal samples collected; all tested negative for KPC KP. Conclusion: Persistent carriage of KPC KP is more common in patients with recent acquisition, and is related to LTCF stay. A single negative KPC KP test is insufficient to exclude persistent carriage. The potential for transmission of KPC KP to close family members and caregivers is low.O625 Nosocomial outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase producing Klebsiella oxytoca, Austria M. Hoenigl*, T. Valentin, H. Salzer, E. Leitner, J. Posch, G. Zarfel, K. Seeber, I. Zollner-Schwetz, R. Krause, A.

Outside the US, KPCproducing K. Pneumonia have recently been reported from several European countries, including Greece,Israel, Poland, Germany, or   France. In contrast reports of KPC-producing K. oxytoca are rare. We report the first nosocomial outbreak of KPC carbapenemase producing Klebsiella oxytoca. Methods: Analysis of the outbreak was conducted using the DiversiLab System. Isolates were considered to be indistinguishable, closely related, possibly related, or unrelated. ''Indistinguishable'' was defined as >98% similarity and none banding differences.Results: From October 2010 through February 2011 five patients were colonized (n = 2) or infected (n = 3) by KPC-producing K. oxytoca. All patients were admitted to the same room of a medical intensive care unit in Austria. Automated rep-PCR assays showed >97.9% similarity of isolated strains and confirmed the nosocomial outbreak.

Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted at two tertiary care hospitals located in Athens between September 2009 and November 2010. Consecutive patients with K. pneumoniae BSIs were identified and followed up until discharge or death. Susceptibilities to antibiotics were determined by the E test. All isolates were examined for the presence of carbapenemases by combined disk test based on meropenem-EDTA and meropenem-boronates synergy. The carbapenemase encoding genes were detected by PCR using specific primers for blaVIM and blaKPC. Results: A total of 347 patients were included in the analysis; 214 (62.8%) were infected with CPKP (134 with KPC, 44 with VIM, 36 with both KPC and VIM) and 133 were infected with non-CPKP. During the study period, the incidence of KPC BSIs increased from 0.16 to 0.31/1000 patient-days whereas the incidence of VIM BSIs remained low and stable (0.07/1000 patient-days). The all-cause 14-day mortality rates were 17.3% (23 of 133) for patients infected with carbapenemase-negative organisms, 20.5% (9 of 44) for those infected with VIM-positive organisms, and 29.4% (50 of 170) for those infected with KPC or KPC and VIM-positive organisms (p = 0.042). OR = 1.99; p = 0.003) were independent predictors of death. After adjustment for appropriate therapy, the effect of carbapenemase production on outcome was reduced to a level of non-significance, whereas administration of appropriate treatment was associated with favorable outcome (OR = 3.2; p = 0.006). Conclusion: In patients with K. pneumoniae BSIs, carbapenemase production, severity of sepsis, underlying diseases, and polymicrobial bacteremia were independent predictors of adverse outcome. The higher mortality associated with carbapenemase production was mediated by the failure to provide effective therapy.O629 Emergence of a colistin-resistant KPC-3-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae ST512 clone in an Italian university hospital B.

Results: From April 2009 to March 2011, there were 1554 isolates of CDI of which 1058 (69.5%) were successfully assigned a ribotype. Since April 2009 the most prevalent ribotype was type 078, 129/822 isolates in 2009/10 (15.7%) and 119/730 isolates in 2010/ 11(16.3%). In 2010/11, of the 119 individuals with ribotype 078, the median age was 82 and 74 were female (62.2%). 39/119 (38.7%) isolates of 078 were community associated, 34/119 (28.6%) hospital associated and 46/119 (38.7%) were indeterminate. 12/119 (21%)",

            "text": "Objectives: The ability of A. baumannii to form biofilms on abiotic surfaces and adhere to eukaryotic cells is central to its survival success and pathogenicity. We found that the metabolism of L-glutamate is essential for biofilm formation (Cabral et al., 2011), as well as the presence of the D-glutamate isomer. Glutamate racemase is one of the two enzymes that catalyses the formation of D-glutamate, which is necessary for cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis. We examined the roles of the two glutamate racemase genes of A. baumannii, named murl1 and murl2, during abiotic biofilm formation and interaction with HeLa cells. Methods: The murl1 and murl2 mutants of A. baumannii ATCC 17978 were obtained by disruption of the target genes by single homologous recombination events with internal fragments of these genes cloned into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector. Abiotic biofilms were cultivated in 96-well polystyrene plates, stained with crystal violet and quantified at 570 nm. HeLa cells were grown in six-well plates or coverslips placed in six-well plates. Confluent monolayers were infected with 2 \u00b7 10^6 bacterial cells, and incubated for 1 hours at 37\u00b0C. After washing, the infected monolayers were lysed and lysate dilutions were plated to determine the number of bacteria attached to HeLa cells. For SEM analysis, the coverslips were fixed to aluminium stubs, coated with gold and examined with a Jeol JSM-6400 scanning electron microscope. Results: The murl1 and murl2 mutants did not form biofilms on polystyrene when L-glutamate was provided as the only carbon source. In the presence of another source of carbon, the murl1 mutant still produced no visible biofilm, while murl2 showed similar levels to the",

            "text": "hospitals is likely to be observed. Psychiatric adverse effects have been reported in patients who were placed on short-term isolation. Therefore a study was conducted to assess whether there is an increase in symptoms of anxiety, depression, and fluctuation of mood in adult patients under isolation. Secondary objective was to define if isolation was associated to an increase in infectious diseases (central venous catheter and urinary tract infections) as well non-infectious complications (sore ulcers and patients' fall). Methods: A cross-sectional matched case-control study was conducted. Cases (Cs) were patients under isolation for more than 48 hours (hrs). Controls (Ct) were randomly selected among patients who did not experience isolation and matched by ward and duration of hospitalisation before study inclusion. Patients were evaluated at 48 hours of isolation or at study inclusion and then every 5 days with modified Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D),UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS), and self-reported visualanalogue-scale (VAS). Changes in UCLA-LS, CES-D, and VAS scores were examined by performing the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results: Ninety-seven patients were included. Baseline characteristics were not different among Cs and Ct. Psychological adverse events were observed 8-time more frequently among Cs. A significant higher increase of UCLA-LS score and of CES-D score at 10 days was observed among Cs (from 22 to 25 vs. 14 to 16 among Ct, p < 0.01 and from 20 to 24 vs. 12 to 15 in Ct, p < 0.01, respectively). The VAS score significantly decreased after 15 days (from 45 to 39, p < 0.001) among Cs. Non-infectious and infectious related complications did not significantly differ. Conditional regression analysis, after adjusting for comorbidities, identified isolation as independent factor associated with alteration of psychiatric tests after 10 days of isolation. Conclusions: Our study suggests that isolation for more than 48 hours significantly increases patients' levels of anxiety and depression. Since a projection for person needing this control measure suggests a significant increase in the next few years, strategies designed to reduce and control the negative impact of isolation should be urgently defined and implemented. and an open invite to relevant primary care staff to the hospital antimicrobial and infection control committee meetings. The proportion of total antibacterial prescriptions of quinolones, cephalosporins or co-amoxiclav was assessed at the start and end of the period. A basic regression analysis was used to look for a significant downward trend.Conclusions: HAI travel freely between community & hospital. There is variation in the dynamics & resources of PCT and hospital ICTs. However, the key to a successful joint HAI programme is team working and complimenting expertise, joint initiatives and real-time monitoring of the HAI to meet new challenges.O656 Optimising antimicrobial use: outcome of IV antimicrobial rounds as part of an antimicrobial stewardship programme at a large district general hospital in East of England T.
