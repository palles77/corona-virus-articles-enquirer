When who-infects-whom is not observed, we use an EM algorithm to average the Nelson-Aalen estimates from all possible combinations of who-infected-whom consistent with the observed data. This converges to a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimate of the cumulative hazard function that we call the marginal Nelson-Aalen estimate. We study the behavior of these methods in simulations and use them to analyze household surveillance data from the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic.",

Current statistical methods for infectious disease data fall into two categories: chainbinomial models and generation interval models. In a chain binomial model, the transmission of disease is modeled as a discrete-time process. Methods based on generation intervals use continuous time, but they model the transmission of disease as a process that creates a population of infected individuals rather than a process of spread through an existing susceptible population. In this paper, we propose nonparametric statistical methods that model the spread of disease through an existing population in continuous time. These methods are a nonparametric counterpart to those of Kenah (2011) .",

Given that i infected j, i must have infected j before anyone else. Generation and serial intervals contract because of this competition among infectives to infect the remaining susceptibles.

            "text": "If there is no rapid transmission within small groups, the generation interval distribution is stable very early in an epidemic, when most new infections have been exposed to only one infective. However, the assumption that generation intervals are independent and identicallydistributed (iid) severely constrains the underlying epidemic model. Consider a model with only two people, i and j. Upon infection, there is a constant hazard \u03bb of infectious contact. The infectious period is with probability p or with probability q = 1 -p. If person i is infected and person j is susceptible, the generation interval X has the probability density function (pdf) where 1 S equals one if S is true and zero otherwise. Now suppose i can transmit infection to a second susceptible k, and assume that transmission between j and k cannot occur (to avoid generation interval contraction). The generation interval Y from i to k has the pdf g(y). However, the joint pdf of X and Y is because the infectious period of i is either or , not both. X and Y are independent if and only if p = 0 or q = 0. A similar result holds for the latent period from infection to the onset of infectiousness. Suppose i has infectious period \u03b9 and becomes infectious immediately with probability p or after a latent period \u03b5 > 0 with probability q = 1 -p. Then X and Y each have the pdf but their joint pdf is Again, X and Y are independent if and only if p = 0 or q = 0. In general, statistical methods based on iid generation intervals implicitly require constant latent and infectious periods. When serial intervals are used as a proxy for generation intervals, a constant incubation period (from infection to symptom onset) is also required.",

            "text": "Much of the trouble with generation and serial intervals is caused by conditioning on the transmission of infection. Kenah (2011) outlined an alternative analysis of epidemic data based on contact intervals. The contact interval \u03c4 ij from an infectious person i to a susceptible person j is the time from the onset of infectiousness in i to the first infectious contact from i to j, where we define infectious contact as a contact sufficient to infect a susceptible individual. It will be right-censored if j is infected by someone other than i or if i stops being infectious before making infectious contact with j. This censoring is handled using methods adapted from survival analysis. The distribution of \u03c4 ij provides a concise summary of the evolution of infectiousness over time in person i because its hazard function equals the hazard of infectious contact from i to j while i is infectious. Likelihoods written in terms of contact intervals improve on likelihoods based on generation or serial intervals by using information contributed by uninfected person-time and accounting for exposure to multiple infectives. They improve on chain-binomial models by allowing the use of continuous time, which more accurately re ects the data-generating mechanism underlying infectious disease data. This paper outlines the nonparametric survival analysis of epidemic data based on contact intervals. The rest of Section 1 defines the general stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model, outlines assumptions about the censoring and observation processes, and discusses the application of these methods to Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) models. Section 2 outlines the Nelson-Aalen and marginal Nelson-Aalen estimators for infectious disease data. Section 2.1 shows that the Nelson-Aalen estimator produces an unbiased estimate of the cumulative hazard function of the contact interval distribution when who-infects-whom is observed. Section 2.2 describes an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that can produce a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of this cumulative hazard function when who-infects-whom is not observed. Section 3 explores the performance of these estimators in simulations, and Section 4 uses them to analyze household surveillance data from the 2009 in uenza A(H1N1) pandemic. Section 5 discusses the limitations, advantages, and future development of these methods.",

We assume that the contact interval distribution is continuous with the hazard function \u03bb 0 (\u03c4) and the cumulative hazard function (2) We call \u03c4 the infectiousness age. By the de nition of the contact interval, \u03bb 0 (\u03c4) is the hazard of infectious contact from an infective i at infectiousness age \u03c4 to any given j such that C ij = 1. The hazard of infectious contact is a familiar idea in infectious disease epidemiology. The contact interval distribution is simply the distribution defined by this hazard function. This change of perspective makes survival analysis a natural framework for the analysis of infectious disease data.",

The marginal Nelson-Aalen curve has much larger jumps on days 1, 2, and 3 following infection than on days 5 and 6, which places the highest infectiousness on the day prior to, the day of, and the day after the onset of symptoms.

For comparison, we have parametric estimates of the cumulative hazard function assuming exponential and Weibull contact interval distributions.

Note the large jumps on days 1, 2, and 3 following the onset of infectiousness and the small jumps on days 5 and 6. Sensitivity analyses for the nonparametric analysis of the LA county household data. There is little sensitivity to the assumed incubation and infectious periods. There is greater sensitivity to the assumed latent period, but there is good evidence for transmission on the day prior to symptom onset and little evidence of significant transmission \u22652 days prior to symptom onset Donnelly et al., 2011) .
