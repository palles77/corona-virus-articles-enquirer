[6] [7] [8] Consequently, the benefits of feeding bovine colostrum or colostrum supplements in human patients with diarrhea have been investigated with variable outcomes. Oral supplementation with a bovine colostrum supplement in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection-associated diarrhea results in a dramatic decrease in stool evacuations per day, decrease in self-estimated fatigue, and an increase in body weight. 9 In contrast, supplementation with bovine colostrum in human patients with short bowel syndrome results in an increase in diarrhea with no improvement in intestinal absorption. 10 Diarrhea is the most common disease condition in preweaned dairy calves in the United States, accounting for 56.4% of deaths. 11 In nonsick calves, oral supplementation with immunoglobulin G (IgG) from 2 to 14 days of age reduced frequency of occurrence of diarrhea, and improved daily weight gain. 12 Oral administration of colostrum or immunoglobulin supplements might provide local immunity in the gastrointestinal tract of calves, thereby reducing frequency and/or preventing the occurrence of diarrhea.",

Given the reported benefits of bovine colostrum or immunoglobulin supplements in human and bovine studies and their potential use as nonantibiotic alternatives, investigations on their use for management of calf diarrhea are warranted. We hypothesized that oral supplementation with immunoglobulins in neonatal dairy calves with diarrhea will reduce treatment events, time to resolution of diarrhea, and mortality rates compared with placebo and control calves.

The specified outcome of interest was resolution of diarrhea based on fecal scoring. At the exit time point, calves that did not have the outcome of interest (resolution of diarrhea) were censored. Differences in time to resolution of diarrhea among the 3 survival plots were compared using the Sidak test. The effect of age at enrollment, serum IgG concentrations, fecal score at enrollment, medical treatments, and daily milk intake as explanatory variables for time to resolution of diarrhea was determined using the Cox proportional hazard model, and subsequent determination of risk ratios. Risk ratios <1 or >1 with a corresponding P < .05 were considered significant. In all analyses P <.05 was significant.",

CONT, control; PLCB, placebo; TRXT, treatment Several reasons might explain the lack of effect on diarrhea after addition of immunoglobulins in milk in our study. We added 20 g of immunoglobulins per feeding (40 g per day) based on a previous study in calves which reported a reduction in frequency of occurrence of diarrheal disease in nonsick calves when 10 g of IgG was added twice daily to milk replacer. 12 Considering that calves in our study had diarrhea, we estimated that supplementing with twice as much immunoglobulins compared to previous studies 12 Calves in the TRXT group were supplemented with immunoglobulin derived from bovine serum. Serum derived immunoglobulin supplements contain higher IgG 2 concentrations than IgG 1 because bovine serum contains higher IgG 2 concentrations. 35 In contrast, bovine colostrum-derived immunoglobulin supplements contain higher IgG 1 concentrations than IgG 2 because IgG 1 is selectively secreted from the cow's circulation into colostrum. 36 Although IgG 1 is considered the principal immunoglobulin for passive immunization (requiring absorption from the gut), our study assessed local immunity by the immunoglobulins. Although previous reviews indicated that only IgG 1 activates complement, 35 other studies indicated that both bovine IgG 1 and IgG 2 activate complement and mediate phagocytosis. 36 Potentially, response of calves with diarrhea to supplementation with bovine serum-derived immunoglobulin might differ from bovine colostrum-derived immunoglobulin.",

The 20 g of immunoglobulins was delivered through 182 g of the powdered supplement, thereby adding solid weight to 2 L of milk.Any further addition of larger supplement weight to increase the amount of immunoglobulin will likely affect mixing, viscosity, and palatability of the milk leading to decrease in milk and immunoglobulin supplement consumption. Consequently, it is possible that the dose of immunoglobulins in our study was not sufficient to cause an effect when fed to calves with diarrhea. Furthermore, catabolism of immunoglobulins or passage of immunoglobulins through the gastrointestinal tract of calves with diarrhea might be higher than nondiarrheic calves, and thus higher doses of immunoglobulins are required to produce an effect. Effect of supplementation of immunoglobulins might also depend on the identity of the pathogens causing diarrhea. it is possible that supplementation of oral immunoglobulin might be effective against specific pathogen classes (viral, bacterial, or protozoal) because of different mechanisms causing diarrhea. Diarrhea in calves is a complex disease syndrome characterized by coinfections with bacterial, viral, and protozoal pathogens, which might explain why the immunoglobulin supplementation was not effective as expected. Duration and severity of the diarrhea might also depend on the age of the calf, passive immune status of the calf, and the etiology of the diarrhea.Maldigestion and malabsorptive diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium or rotavirus causes loss of mature villous enterocytes resulting in mild to severe diarrhea of shorter clinical duration.[23][24][25][26] In contrast, maldigestion and malabsorptive diarrhea caused by coronavirus causes loss of mature and crypt enterocytes of the small intestine and colon resulting in pro-",

Although unlikely to influence the results, the difference in crude protein, ash, and vitamins between the TRXT and PLCB supplements could not be adjusted easily by dilution without delaying feeding of nonenrolled calves by the farm personnel. Thus, no attempt was made to adjust the difference in the crude protein, ash, or vitamins at the time of feeding. Although it is likely practical to add supplements to milk or milk replacers in clinic settings or for individual calves in small dairy herds, it is important to note that this might not be time efficient on a large dairy farm. Although in our study there was no additional time required for feeding the calves because the authors added the supplements and fed all the enrolled calves, additional labor by farm personnel might be required for addition of supplements to individual calves with diarrhea on a large dairy farm. We did not consider dehydration status or acid-base assessments using serum biochemical analysis or base deficit prediction charts based on body position, strength of the suckle reflex, and age 37 of the calf in our study. Although group assignment of calves was randomized, and only calves with uncomplicated diarrhea were enrolled, and medical treatments were included as a covariate for time to resolution of diarrhea in the data analysis, acid-base status of the calves might affect medical treatments and response to treatment. The increase in osmolarity after adding the supplement might exacerbate the diarrhea or affect viscosity and palatability. We did not assess the change in osmolarity after the addition of the supplements for each feeding as this would have decreased the efficiency of the feeding process by farm personnel. The supplement fed to the PLCB group calves contained potassium, whereas the TRXT group supplement contained no potassium. Although we did not determine the plasma potassium concentrations in our study, calves with diarrhea are frequently normokalemic or hyperkalemic in the presence of acidemia 38,39 despite potential intestinal losses or decreased milk consumption.40 Thus, hypokalemia is infrequently observed in calves with diarrhea.38,39 Supplementation of potassium in hyperkalemic calves with diarrhea might cause severe cardiac conduction abnormalities and arrythmias, 41 thereby negatively affecting recovery of calves from diarrhea.",
