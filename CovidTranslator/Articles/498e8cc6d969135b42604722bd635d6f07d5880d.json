            "text": "Recent observations revealed a novel role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and the angiotensin II type-1 receptor (AT1R) in lung injury, thereby extending knowledge about the functions of the angiotensin system. Angiotensin II, whose target is the AT1R, is a potent vasoconstrictor. Accordingly, an imbalance leading to enhanced activity of the angiotensin II-AT1R axis is postulated to contribute to both circulatory disturbances and lung injury. In this context, a functional single-nucleotide polymorphism, AT1R A1166C, which leads to enhanced responsiveness of the AT1R, has been postulated as a candidate susceptibility factor for ischemic stroke. The aim of our study was to investigate its occurrence in ischemic stroke and to analyze its possible synergistic associations with clinical risk factors. Genetic and clinical data on 308 consecutive patients with acutely developing ischemic stroke were analyzed. A total of 272 stroke and neuroimaging alteration-free subjects served as a control group. Univariate and logistic regression statistical approaches were used. Alone, the AT1R 1166C allele did not pose a risk of stroke. In hypertensive smokers, however, it was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke (OR 22.3, 95% CI 5.8-110.2, p < 0.001). Further subgroup analysis revealed the same association for both small-vessel (OR 24.3, 95% CI 6.1-121.1, p < 0.001) and large-vessel (OR 21.3, 95% CI 4.6-81.1, p < 0.001) infarction. On a pathophysiological basis, our results suggest the possibility that the AT1R A1166C polymorphism might give rise to ischemic stroke indirectly via an unfavorable effect on the cardiorespiratory function.",

            "text": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the maintenance of blood pressure into angiotensin II. Angiotensin II, which binds the angiotensin II type-1 receptor (AT1R), is a potent vasoconstrictor and a stimulator of cardiac growth Kuba et al., 2005; Nicholls and Peiris, 2005) . However, ACE2 converts angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7 Kuba et al., 2005; Nicholls and Peiris, 2005) , which has functions opposite those of angiotensin II, acting as a potent vasodilator and a repressor of cardiac growth (Ferreira and Santos, 2005; Imai et al., 2005; Kuba et al., 2005; Nicholls and Peiris, 2005) . Recent papers have raised the possibility that an elevated level of angiotensin II and an enhanced activity of AT1R might be associated with lung injury Kuba et al., 2005; Nicholls and Peiris, 2005) . Hence, an imbalance leading to enhanced activity of the angiotensin II-AT1R axis might contribute to both circulatory disturbances and lung damage. The ACE D/D polymorphism associated with an elevated angiotensin II level has been demonstrated to play an important role in the development of ischemic stroke, indicating genetic involvement in the affected function of the RAS (Szolnoki et al., 2002 (Szolnoki et al., , 2003 Um et al., 2003) . In this context, a functional single-nucleotide polymorphism, AT1R A1166C, which leads to enhanced responsiveness of the AT1R, has been postulated as a candidate susceptibility factor for ischemic stroke, cardiovascular events, and hypertension (Hindorff et al., 2002; Treszl et al., 2003; Fukazawa et al., 2004; Kobashi et al., 2004; Rubattu et al., 2004; Sugimoto et al., 2004) . A direct role of the AT1R A1166C polymorphism in ischemic stroke has not been proved, although its unfavorable effect is strongly suggested (Rubattu et al., 2004) . The aims of the present study were to investigate the occurrence of the AT1R A1166C polymorphism in ischemic stroke and to analyze its possible synergistic association with clinical risk factors (smoking and hypertension), which might also be associated indirectly with lung disorders.",

These subjects had been admitted to our Department of Neurology and Neurophysiology between January 1998 and January 2004 after being examined by an internist in the local emergency unit or by a family physician at their homes. All 308 subjects underwent detailed clinical scrutiny, including medical history, family history, an evaluation of vascular risk factors, general physical and neurological examinations, urine analysis, extensive laboratory examinations, electrocardiography, extracranial and transcranial Doppler sonography of the brain-supplying arteries, transthoracic and/or transesophageal echocardiography, where appropriate, and MRI examinations within 2 d after the onset of symptoms. All scans were read by an experienced investigator without knowledge of the clinical and laboratory data. The patients were enrolled immediately after the clinical neurological and MRI examinations. Subjects on whom MRIs could not be recorded or for whom the examined clinical parameters and risk factors could not be obtained with certainty in consequence of some technical cause or death were excluded from the study groups. Patients with atrial fibrillation were also excluded to make the study groups more homogenous.",

Data show that the AT1R 1166C allele is associated with increased angiotensin II responsiveness (van Geel et al., 2000; Jones et al., 2003) . This feature of the AT1R A1166C polymorphism might be the molecular basis of its enhancing effect on the endothelial dysfunction caused by hypertension and smoking. The evidence concerning a direct role of the AT1R C1166A presence of the AT1R 1166C allele did not lead to an additional increase in the ORs of hypertension or smoking for ischemic stroke (Table 3) .

The AT1R 1166C allele did not increase the risk of stroke in the presence of either hypertension or smoking separately, as compared with the risk of ischemic stroke caused by hypertension and smoking alone. However, the co-occurrence of the AT1R 1166C allele, hypertension, and smoking enhanced the risk of ischemic stroke as compared both with the control group and the risk of ischemic stroke caused by the combination of hypertension and smoking. The subgroup analysis revealed that the interaction between the two clinical risk factors and the AT1R 1166C allele reached a similar extent in all subgroups of stroke. The crude and adjusted ORs demonstrated that the presence of the AT1R 1166C allele increased the risk of ischemic stroke only if the stroke patient was both a smoker and suffered from hypertension. Because no association was found between the AT1R 1166C allele and hypertension or smoking alone, an additive interaction might be presumed between the two clinical risk factors and the AT1R 1166C allele. 63.2 \u00b1 11.5 a 53.7 \u00b1 14.8 BMI (kg/m 2 ) 26.9 \u00b1 2.0 a 23.1 \u00b1 3.1 Cholesterol (mmol/L) 6.9 \u00b1 1.5 a 5.2 \u00b1 1.5 Triglycerides (mmol/L) 1.92 \u00b1 0.9 a 1.2 6 \u00b1 0.8 Hematocrit ( Journal of Molecular Neuroscience Volume 28, 2006 mutation in ischemic stroke and hypertension, however, seems to be inconclusive (Hindorff et al., 2002; Agachan et al., 2003; Jones et al., 2003; Sugimoto et al., 2004) .
