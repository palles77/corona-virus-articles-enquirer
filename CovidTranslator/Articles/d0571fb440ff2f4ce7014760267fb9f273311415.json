Severe trauma represents the leading cause of mortality worldwide, and is the third highest cause of death in France behind cardiovascular disease and cancer. About 46 deaths following trauma occur per 100,000 inhabitants per year in France, representing close to 8% of all deaths. [1 2] While 80% of deaths occur within the first 24 hours of trauma, directly related to the trauma itself, 20% of deaths occur later and are mainly due to healthcareassociated infections (HAI). [3] [4] [5] [6] More than 50% of patients that present with severe trauma will develop at least one HAI during their stay. Neurological disorders, recourse to mechanical ventilation and early post-traumatic immune suppression may explain the elevated incidence of HAI, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which mainly occur in the first week following trauma. [7] [8] [9] Ventilator-associated pneumonia represents the predominant HAI in severe trauma patients with a mean incidence of 35%, which may even exceed 60% in some series, followed by catheter infections and bacteraemia. [3] [4] [5] [6] HAI account for heightened morbidity and mortality, longer stays in the ICU and increased treatment costs. In France, the additional cost is estimated at \u20ac800 million per year [1] . These infections also require high use of antibiotics, and VAP alone makes up more than half of the antibiotic treatments prescribed in the ICU. [7] Given the selection pressure they induce, these antibiotic therapies favour the appearance of bacterial resistance.",

Therefore, regular monitoring of tracheal cuff pressure is recommended, but the optimal monitoring frequency has yet to be clearly determined. Underinflation and/or overinflation of the tracheal cuff often occurs in ventilated patients under intermittent manual control of tracheal cuff pressure using a manometer, which is a well-known source of morbidity and mortality.

The VAP prevention measures recommended by the 2008 French consensus conference on nosocomial infection prevention [12] state that the orotracheal route should be used for tracheal intubation instead of the nasal route,[7 11 13] and the tracheal cuff pressure should be maintained between 25 and 30 cm H 2 O.[14 15] They also recommend using a sedation-analgesia algorithm that facilitates early weaning off ventilation, avoidance of unplanned extubation,[16] prioritising the use of non-invasive ventilation by following the recognised indications,[16 17] placing the patient in a semirecumbent position between 30-45\u00b0,[18 19] regularly decontaminating the nasal and oropharyngeal cavity through suitable mouth care,[20 21] and starting enteral nutrition as early as possible.[22] When combined with systemic antibiotic therapy, selective digestive decontamination may be recommended, but its implementation requires specification of not only its modalities (choice, dosing, duration of selective digestive decontamination and antibiotic therapy), but also the targeted population.",

Two methods of continuous regulation of tracheal cuff pressure are available: pneumatic and electronic. Published studies favour the first [33] due to better reactivity with fewer periods of insufficient or excessive tracheal cuff pressure, and consequently, reduced risk of microbe inhalation and tracheal injuries, in addition to the low acquisition cost, ease of use, and no electricity supply required.",

While 80% of deaths occur within the first 24 hours after trauma, 20% occur later and are mainly due to healthcare-associated infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).Preventing underinflation of the tracheal cuff is recommended to reduce microaspiration, which play a major role in the pathogenesis of VAP. Automatic devices facilitate the regulation of tracheal cuff pressure, and their implementation has the potential to reduce VAP. The objective of this work is to determine whether continuous regulation of tracheal cuff pressure using a pneumatic device reduces the incidence of VAP compared to intermittent control in severe trauma patients.Methods and analysis:This multicentre, randomised, controlled and open-label trial will include patients suffering from severe trauma that are admitted within the first 24 hours, who require invasive mechanical ventilation to longer than 48 hours. Their tracheal cuff pressure will be monitored either once every 8 hours (control group) or continuously using a pneumatic device (intervention group). The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients that develop VAP in the intensive care unit (ICU) at day-28. The secondary endpoints include the proportion of patients that develop VAP in the ICU, early (\u22647 days) or late (>7 days) VAP, time until the first VAP diagnosis, the number of ventilator-free days and antibiotic-free days, the length of stay in the ICU, the proportion of patients with ventilator associated events and that die during their ICU stay.Ethics and dissemination:This protocol has been approved by the ethics committee of Poitiers University Hospital, and will be carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

            "text": "best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study to evaluate the usefulness of continuous pneumatic regulation of tracheal cuff pressure in a population of severe trauma patients, who will also benefit from other recommended VAP preventive measures. At an individual level, the benefits are expected to include reduced duration of mechanical ventilation and stay in the ICU, as well as improved patient prognosis. At a collective level, a lower cost of hospital stay is expected, in addition to fewer days on antibiotics, associated with a reduction in the selective pressure perpetuating multidrug-resistant bacteria.In order to keep management practices as standardised as possible, we decided to limit thenumber of investigating centres to 15 university hospital centres (CHU), all of which are recognised in the field of trauma care and treat more than 50 severe trauma patients per year. These centres belong to three networks that share the common objective of promoting multicentre clinical research, consisting of AtlanR\u00e9a (Grand Ouest surgical intensive care network), AzuR\u00e9a (Grand Sud intensive care network) and TraumaBase (APHP trauma intensive care network). These 15 centres also share the same standards of care. Previous studies that have evaluated devices aimed to continuously regulate tracheal cuff pressure have reported that these devices are efficient in controlling cuff pressure,[41] and are well-tolerated by patients.[33] In this setting, the choice of a pneumatic device instead of an electronic device presents several advantages [33]: better reactivity with fewer periods of insufficient or excessive pressure into the tracheal cuff, and consequently, reduced risk of microinhalations and tracheal lesions; no need for an electricity supply; low acquisition cost; and ease of use. Finally, the encouraging preliminary results previously reported using this device also significantly contributed to our choice.[27] Page 22 of 42 For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml BMJ Open",
