            "text": "This paper is an attempt to estimate the risk of infection importation and exportation by travelers. Two countries are considered: one disease-free country and one visited or source country with a running endemic or epidemic infectious disease. Two models are considered. In the first model (disease importation), susceptible individuals travel from their disease-free home country to the endemic country and come back after some weeks. The risk of infection spreading in their home country is then estimated supposing the visitors are submitted to the same force of infection as the local population but do not contribute to it. In the second model (disease exportation), it is calculated the probability that an individual from the endemic (or epidemic) country travels to a disease-free country in the condition of latent infected and eventually introduces the infection there. The input of both models is the force of infection at the visited/source country, assumed known. The models are deterministic, but a preliminary stochastic formulation is presented as an appendix. The models are exemplified with two distinct real situations: the risk of dengue importation from Thailand to Europe and the risk of Ebola exportation from Liberia to the USA.

The most notorious example is perhaps the Black Death of the XIV century, which decimated from a quarter to a half of the European population (Massad et al. 2004; Bossak and Welford 2009) . Many centuries later, the Spanish Flu, which killed between 50 and 100 million individuals worldwide, started in an American army barrack in the United States in 1918, and rapidly spread by travelers to others areas of the world (Caley et al. 2007; Massad et al. 2007 ). Almost one hundred years later, SARS frightened many countries due to its potential spread by infected travelers (Wilder-Smith and Freedman 2003; Massad et al. 2005a ). The swine flu pandemic (H1N1) of 2009 is another example of the dangers of international spread of communicable diseases (Khan et al. 2009; Massad et al. 2010) . The current outbreak of Ebola is the most recent example of the risk of a new and, in this case, frequently fatal disease, posed by individuals traveling from infected to uninfected areas of the world (Gomes et al. 2014; Pandey et al. 2014) .",

This occurs at the international and national levels and even between different districts in the same city.

The greatest concern for global health now is the ability of a traveller with an infectious disease to travel to virtually any part of the world within 24 h. The current volume, speed, and reach of travel are unprecedented. International tourist arrivals have shown a virtually uninterrupted growth-from 25 million in 1950 to 278 million in 1980 278 million in , 528 million in 1995 278 million in , and 1087 278 million in million in 2013 278 million in (UNWTO 2014 . Asia and the Pacific recorded the fastest relative growth across all World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) regions, with a 6 % increase in international arrivals per year in recent years. Asia is the epicenter of many infectious diseases (UNWTO 2014) . Africa, another continent with many emerging infectious diseases, saw an increase of 5 %. International tourist arrivals worldwide are expected to increase by 3.3 % a year from 2010 to 2030 to reach 1.8 billion by 2030, according to UNWTO's long-term forecast Tourism Towards 2030 (UNWTO 2014) .",

An increased volume of international passenger air traffic originating from regions with endemic dengue has contributed to a rise in the number of dengue cases in both endemic areas and elsewhere (Jones et al. 2008; Wilder-Smith 2006; Khan et al. 2010) . Another example is that the main hindrance to polio eradication is the spread of polio via travelers to polio-free countries (Quam et al. 2014; Wilder-Smith and Tambyah 2007) . It is important to be able to calculate or at least estimate the number of cases due to the importation or exportation of infectious diseases via travelers. Current methodological approaches to estimate the risk of diseases in travelers still have many shortcomings (Wilder-Smith 2006; Khan et al. 2010; Quam et al. 2014; Wilder-Smith and Tambyah 2007; Leder et al. 2013) . For example, estimations based on notifications of imported cases underestimate the risk. This is so because many diseases are either not notifiable to authorities or even if legally notifiable are underreported, as not every traveller will report her/his condition to healthcare providers. Moreover, many imported diseases may go unnoticed because of a high frequency of asymptomatic cases that may also contribute to the transmission of diseases.",

Two different models describe these two situations. The theory described in Sect. 2.1 and 2.2 are exemplified by the case of the potential risk of dengue introduction into Europe (importation model, Sect. 2.1.5), and the case of Ebola exportation to disease-free countries (Sect. 2.2.1). The model's implications and limitations are discussed in Sect. 3. In \"Appendix 1\", we present a more detailed discussion of the parameters and data aggregation used previously to estimate the risk of dengue among international travelers visiting Thailand (Massad et al. 2013) .

It proposes a model taking into account the force of infection of the disease in the endemic country, which can either be a visited country (source of infection importation) or a country from where local residents export the infection when traveling in the latent condition to disease-free countries. The model is deterministic but a preliminary stochastic formulation is presented in \"Appendix 2\". It assumes that, in the case of disease importation, travelers are subject to the same risk of infection as local residents. In the case of disease exportation, the model considers the probability that a latent individual travels to a disease-free country. The model is exemplified by two distinct situations, namely, the risk of dengue importation from Thailand to Europe and the risk of Ebola exportation from Liberia to the USA. The model can also be applied to other cases as, for instance, that of Yellow Fever in Brazil (Massad et al. 2005b ).",

This is encouraging in the sense that the model may represent a significant step forward in the readiness for disease-free countries to deal with infections previously exotic to their environment. It is important, however, to point out some limitations of the model. Firstly, and mostly, the model heavily depends on the estimation of local dynamics of the infections at risk of being spread to other parts of the world. Secondly, it depends on the estimation of the parameters related to transmission in the host country. For instance, in the case of a vector-borne infection, it is central to know (or at least to have a reasonable estimate) of the vectors' density and biting habits in the host country. Thirdly, the deterministic nature of the main models does not allow estimation of many uncertainties related to parameter estimation among others. As shown in \"Appendix 2\" a stochastic framework would allow the calculation of the probability of a given number of infected travelers returning infected to their home-countries. The simple model presented in the appendix was intended to exemplify an alternative approach. Finally, the sheer number of people traveling to and from endemic areas, which have been the priority of previous works on this area, is also a necessary component to be included in the calculation of the risk of spreading of exotic infections.",

To differentiate them from those in the second subpopulation, they will be represented by starred letters. Differently from the previous subpopulations, this must be divided in four classes: * S T (susceptible to the infection), * I T (infectious cases abroad), * R T (recovered from * I T and still abroad) and * * * R T (recovered that returned home). These last classes of recovered individuals are resistant to the infection and do not influence the dynamic of the infection eventually introduced in their home country. Because of that, they received two additional stars and were mentioned only for completeness. 4. Finally, the fourth subpopulation (center-right flow in Fig. 2) considers those individuals that have travelled to the endemic country, have acquired the infection there and returned still infective to their home country. It is the population that experience the third time-line in Fig. 1. To differentiate them from the other subpopulations, the individuals of this subpopulation will receive two stars in their representing letters. This subpopulation has no susceptible individuals and can be split in just two classes: those infective individuals that returned home still infective, denoted by * * I T , and those individuals that recovered when back home, denoted by * * R T . 5.

In order to avoid extremely complex equations, this stochastic model is a simplified version of the complete problem, taking \u03bc = \u03b1 = \u03b3 = 0, S T (0) = N T and \u03c3 = \u03c3 .As in the deterministic model, susceptible travelers S H (t) arrive at the visited country at time t = 0. These individuals can either get the infection, with rate \u03bb L , or return to their home country with rate \u03c3 . In the stochastic formulation, the number of individuals in the susceptible state are denoted x; those in the infective state are denoted y; and those that return infected are denoted z. Finally, it is assumed that transitions between the states occur one at a time. The transitions between the states are assumed to occur according to:x, y, z \u2192 x, y, z :which is equal to:or:Using the method of Lagrange (Cox and Miller 1965) :Now, from 4 : G = \u03b1 1 = constant; from 1 = 3 : v = 1 + \u03b1 2 exp(\u03c3 t), \u03b1 3 = constant; and from 1 = 2 :Therefore,The average number of travelers that return to their home country infective is * I H (t) , which is the first derivative of the PGF (39) with respect to w, calculated at",
