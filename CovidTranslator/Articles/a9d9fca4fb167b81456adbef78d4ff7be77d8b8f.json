            "text": "N osocomial infections affect nearly 10% of hospitalized patients and represent a major problem in health care facilities, resulting in prolonged hospital stays, substantial morbidity and mortality, and excessive costs. 1 In the United States, health care-associated infections contribute to the deaths of nearly 90,000 hospital patients each year and increase annual medical expenses by approximately $4.5 billion. 2 In addition, multidrug-resistant pathogens are commonly involved in such infections and render effective treatment challenging. The hands of health care workers (HCWs) are the primary mode of transmission of multidrug-resistant pathogens and infections to patients. 3 Proper hand hygiene is the single most important, simplest, and least expensive means of preventing health careassociated infections and the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Nevertheless, in most health care institutions, adherence to recommended hand-washing practices remains unacceptably low, rarely exceeding 40% of situations in which hand hygiene is indicated. 4 Why do HCWs consistently fail to perform this simple and inexpensive procedure, thereby compromising patient safety and the quality Health care-associated infections constitute one of the greatest challenges of modern medicine. Despite compelling evidence that proper hand washing can reduce the transmission of pathogens to patients and the spread of antimicrobial resistance, the adherence of health care workers to recommended hand-hygiene practices has remained unacceptably low. One of the key elements in improving hand-hygiene practice is the use of an alcoholbased hand rub instead of washing with soap and water. An alcohol-based hand rub requires less time, is microbiologically more effective, and is less irritating to skin than traditional hand washing with soap and water. Therefore, alcohol-based hand rubs should replace hand washing as the standard for hand hygiene in health care settings in all situations in which the hands are not visibly soiled. It is also important to change gloves between each patient contact and to use hand-hygiene procedures after glove removal. Reducing health care-associated infections requires that health care workers take responsibility for ensuring that hand hygiene becomes an everyday part of patient care.",

He noted that puerperal fever was more common on a maternity ward where physicians and medical students provided care to women in labor (ward A) than it was on the ward where midwives assisted at deliveries (ward B). Peripartum mortality on ward A was as high as 18%, compared to only 3% on ward B. 5 At that time, miasma (bad air), dirty bed linen, low social status, and climatic influences were considered possible reasons for the higher mortality on ward A. In contrast, Semmelweis postulated that physicians and students were contaminating their hands while performing autopsies on nonrefrigerated bodies and subsequently introducing a fatal etiologic agent (\"cadaverous particles\") into the birth canal during vaginal examination. Washing their hands with soap and water before examining women in labor did not prevent the epidemic of puerperal fever, and the hands retained a disagreeable odor from the autopsy rooms.",

At that time, microorganisms were unknown to be the cause of infection, and Semmelweis may have chosen chlorinated lime because of its deodorizing characteristic. After introduction of the new hand-hygiene practice, the maternal mortality rate dramatically decreased to less than 3% and remained low for years. Nevertheless, Semmelweis' recommendations were strongly opposed by his coworkers. Rightfully, although undiplomatically, he denounced his unenlightened colleagues as \"killers,\" and his appointment in Vienna ended prematurely. He returned to Pest, Hungary, where he instituted his antiseptic handhygiene method in 2 other hospitals, reducing their mortality rates from more than 10% to less than 1%. Although most physicians at that time ignored his theory, Semmelweis opened a new era in medical science by introducing hand antisepsis in surgery and obstetrics.",

            "text": "Later studies confirmed Semmelweis' findings about the important role of HCWs' hands in the transmission of nosocomial pathogens. Interestingly, although Semmelweis is frequently called a pioneer of hand washing, he actually replaced hand washing with hand disinfection. Chlorinated lime has recently been shown to be one of the most active currently existing disinfectants, reducing bacterial counts on the skin by 6.1 log 10 colony-forming units (CFU). Because chlorinated lime is harmful to the skin, alcohol was later used as a hand antiseptic. Semmelweis' intervention represents the first evidence that disinfection of heavily contaminated hands between patient contacts can reduce nosocomial transmission of contagious diseases more efficiently than hand washing with plain soap and water. However, many subsequently published guidelines continued to recommend washing with soap and water as the standard hand-hygiene practice for decades. 6 Ignorance of scientific evidence supporting the use of an alcoholbased hand rub is difficult to explain. Hand washing may represent an old cultural heritage of human civilization that in the past served not only for the removal of dirt but also to deliver people symbolically from physical and moral evils. 5 More than 150 years after Semmelweis' epidemiological observations and despite advances in microbiology and infection control, implementation of proper hand hygiene remains a challenge in clinical practice today. Recently, completely revised guidelines for hand hygiene in health care settings were published in the United States by an international group from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 7 According to these new hand-hygiene guidelines, the use of an alcohol-based hand rub is the preferred method of hand hygiene in the health care setting. Hands should be washed with soap and water primarily when they are visibly soiled or contaminated with blood, other body fluids, or proteinaceous material. This usually represents less than 10% of all routine patient contacts. In general, the hands should be either rubbed with alcohol (the standard procedure for clean hands) or washed with soap (if visibly soiled), but both procedures should not be used at the same time.",

            "text": "The alcohol hand-rub procedure involves the use of alcohol rather than water. In contrast to hand washing, the objective of this procedure is a more effective and rapid reduction of skin flora by killing, not mechanically removing, microorganisms (all transient flora and most resident flora). Therefore, the alcohol hand-rub procedure should not be confused with hand washing. Vigorous friction, rinsing with water, and drying with a towel are unnecessary. Instead, the technique consists of rubbing alcohol onto both hands until it completely evaporates, usually requiring 15 to 30 seconds. Because alcohol kills microorganisms only where it comes into contact with the skin, the use of sufficient amounts of alcohol (3-5 mL) and spreading it onto all surfaces (rather than mechanical friction) is crucial. Most dispensers deliver 1.5 to 2.0 mL of alcohol per application; therefore, 2 applications are usually necessary to completely cover both hands. 10 The antimicrobial activity of alcohols is based on protein denaturation. They have excellent and rapid (within seconds) germicidal activity against vegetative bacteria, fungi, and many viruses. For hand rubs, ethanol, isopropanol, and/or n-propanol are used (listed in order of increasing antibacterial activity at equal concentrations). Alcohol concentrations of 60% to 95% (vol/vol) kill 3.4 to 5.8 log 10 CFU in 30 seconds, with higher concentrations having better antibacterial activity. 5 However, concentrations of greater than 95% are less potent because water is essential for protein denaturation. The presence of organic material diminishes the antibacterial activity of alcohols by 0.2 to 0.7 log 10 CFU. Alcohol solutions are also highly effective against mycobacteria (the bacteria most resistant to the disinfection process) and multidrug-resistant pathogens but have poor or no activity against bacterial spores and protozoal oocysts.

            "text": "Proper hand hygiene can prevent health care-associated infections and the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial resistance prevalence rates are increasing in many countries around the world. In the United States, during the 5-year period from 1997 through 2001 the proportion of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) among isolates of S aureus causing nosocomial infection continuously increased nationwide from 22.4% to 38.7%. 11 This growth has been paralleled by an increase in other multidrug-resistant organisms such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci, vancomycin-intermediately resistant S aureus, and vancomycin-resistant S aureus. 12 The reasons for these worrisome findings are complex and not entirely clear, but inconsistent isolation practices, misuse of antimicrobial agents, failure to conduct active surveillance cultures, and poor adherence to hand-hygiene practice may have key roles. 13, 14 For example, in some northern European countries, such as Finland and The Netherlands, where a strict MRSA containment \"search-and-destroy\" strategy and the routine use of alcohol-based hand rubs are standard practice, the prevalence of MRSA remains below 1%. In contrast, most southern European countries, which have had inconsistent isolation precautions and hand-washing recommendations for several decades, are struggling with high prevalence rates of MRSA (>30%) and health careassociated infections. 15 The goal of hand hygiene is a sufficient reduction of microbial counts on the skin to prevent cross-transmission of pathogens among patients. It is easier to keep the hands clean than to make them clean. The critical density of microorganisms on the hands needed for the spread of pathogens remains unknown. It may depend on the type and duration of contact, the type of microorganism, and the patient's resident flora (ie, their colonization resistance). As observed by Semmelweis in 1847, washing with plain soap is not always sufficient to prevent hand-borne transmission of pathogens. Although in most instances hand washing is probably sufficient to prevent transmission of microorganisms, in some cases the use of soap and water fails to remove or, paradoxically, even increases the bacterial counts on the skin over baseline counts from clean hands, presumably because of heavy contamination or recontamination by the soap, faucet, or sink. 16, 17 In fact, none of the hand-washing techniques, durations of washing, or types of soaps (antimicrobial or nonantimicrobial) have demonstrated antimicrobial activity equal to or better than that of alcohol-based hand rubs. 5 Multiple in vitro and in vivo experiments have indicated considerably better antimicrobial killing with alcohol hand disinfectants than with hand washing, and the use of alcohol-based hand rubs has been associated with a decrease in nosocomial infection rates. 3, 5, [18] [19] [20] Table 1 summarizes patient-care situations in which hand hygiene is indicated. 7 According to recently revised handhygiene guidelines, the use of an alcohol-based hand rub is the preferred method of hand hygiene. In general, hands should be either rubbed with alcohol (the standard procedure for clean hands) or washed with soap (if visibly soiled); both procedures should not be used at the same time. The use of alcohol immediately before or after hand washing with soap and water is not recommended because it may cause dermatitis. To avoid confusion, alcohol handrub dispensers should not be placed adjacent to sinks but rather placed close to patients (eg, at bedside). Alcoholimpregnated wipes are not as effective as alcohol hand rubs and are not recommended for routine hand hygiene. For hand hygiene outside health care facilities, such as before and after working hours, before eating, or after using a restroom, the use of soap and water is the recommended method.",

Each pair of gloves should be used for the care of only 1 patient. They should be removed immediately after caring for the patient (before touching any surface) and should be changed between care of contaminated and clean body sites on the same patient. Failure to remove gloves after patient contact may result in the spread of nosocomial pathogens among patients or in contamination of surfaces. Gloves should not be washed or reused.

Health care workers with dermatitis are more likely to harbor S aureus and other pathogenic bacteria than those with healthy skin. Skin drying and irritation can be avoided by adding emollients to alcohol formulations, such as glycerol (1%-4%), silicone oils, refattening agents, or rehydrating agents. Moreover, alcohol hand rubs cause substantially less skin irritation and dryness than washing with soap. Hand washing removes lipids from the skin, whereas alcohol compounds only redistribute them. However, either strategy can result in dryness of the skin if skin-care products are not applied regularly. Therefore, HCWs should be advised to use hand lotions or creams frequently to minimize the occurrence of irritant contact dermatitis. Allergies to alcohol are extremely rare, but reactions can be caused by emollients and other compounds added to the alcohol. Importantly, to avoid skin irritation and prevent dilution of the alcohol to concentrations with insufficient antimicrobial activity, alcohol should not be applied to wet skin or to hands with soap residue. Some commercially available alcohol formulations may change the color of fingernails. Other factors that influence the acceptance of alcohol products by HCWs include the odor, color, and consistency of the product.",

Writing new hand-hygiene guidelines alone is not enough. Simple training sessions for HCWs should be held on each ward to introduce the advantages of alcohol hand rubs over hand washing. In addition, patients can be educated about the importance of hand hygiene and be encouraged to ask HCWs to comply with hand-hygiene guidelines. The efficiency of the hand-rub technique can be evaluated with an alcohol product supplemented with fluorescent dye and an ultraviolet light. 9 Another way to estimate the quality of hand hygiene is to evaluate the consumption of soap and alcohol. If HCWs strictly follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hand-hygiene recommendations, the ratio between soap and alcohol consumption should be close to 1:10.

Proper hand hygiene can prevent health care-associated infections and the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Factors that contribute to poor adherence to hand hygiene include poor access to handwashing facilities (sinks), the time required to perform standard hand washing, irritant contact dermatitis associated with frequent exposure to soap and water, high workloads, knowledge deficits among HCWs, and the failure of administrative leaders to make hand hygiene an institutional priority.",

The alcohol hand-rub technique is microbiologically more effective, more accessible, and less likely to cause skin problems and saves time and human resources. As a consequence, alcohol hand rubs are associated with substantially better adherence to hand hygiene than hand washing. The use of alcohol-based hand rubs should replace hand washing as the standard for hand hygiene in health care settings in all situations in which the hands are not visibly soiled.",

Resident flora is acquired from contacts with patients and contaminated environments c. Resident flora is considered important for preventing colonization with potentially more pathogenic microorganisms d. Plain soaps have minimal or no antimicrobial activity and reduce bacterial counts from hands only by mechanical removal e. The antimicrobial activity of alcohols on skin flora is diminished by the presence of organic material 2. Which one of the following statements about alcohol hand rubs is false?a. Alcohol should be rubbed onto all surfaces of the hands until it completely evaporates, and vigorous friction or drying with a towel are unnecessary b. There is no evidence that the use of alcohol for hand hygiene can increase the risk for emergence of resistance against antiseptics c. Alcohol hand rubs cause substantially more skin irritation and dryness than hand washing with soap and water d. All hand-washing techniques demonstrate a lower antimicrobial activity than alcohol hand-rub procedures e. Alcohol should not be applied on wet skin after hand washing with soap and water 3. Which one of the following durations of hand washing is needed to reduce bacterial counts on hands by 3 log 10 CFU? a. 15 ",
