In light of the poor clinical effi cacy of steroids for pneumonia in previous studies, 2,3 a median diff erence of 1 day in length of hospital stay could easily be attributed to confounders such as variations in clinician behaviour and family assess ment of a patient's readiness for discharge. 4 Meijvis and colleagues should also have provided some absolute measures of treatment eff ect. We calculated the absolute risk reduction and number needed to treat to benefi t, along with 95% CIs, for the outcome of hospital admission (webappendix). 5 Data were derived from fi gure 2 of the published study. We found that the absolute risk of remaining in hospital was 15% and 12% lower in the dexamethasone group than in the placebo group at days 8 and 12, respectively. Furthermore, we found that seven and eight patients with communityacquired pneumonia would need to be treated with adjuvant dexamethasone therapy (versus placebo) to result in early discharge of one additional patient on days 8 and 12 of hospital admission, respectively.",

Notably, in viral pneumonia caused by the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, increased viral load has been documented with corticosteroid treatment in a randomised trial. 5 Given the diff erences in immunopathogenesis between viral and bacterial pneumonia, and the uncertainties in effi cacy and safety, 4 we recommend that corticosteroids should not be used routinely in known viral community-acquired pneumonia, especially infl uenzarelated. In this regard, availability of rapid and reliable diagnostics for the causes of communityacquired pneumonia is important to guide antimicrobial treatments (targeted, susceptible antibacterials; or antivirals such as neuraminidase inhibitors), and the use of adjuvant corticosteroids. 2, 4 We declare that we have no confl icts of interest. community-acquired pneumonia with corticosteroids are formalised. Finally, the single case of gastric perforation, potentially caused by the trial drug, might be of greater signifi cance if the benefi cial eff ects of corticosteroids are in doubt. 5 We declare that we have no confl icts of interest. Sabine Meijvis and colleagues 1 conclude that dexamethasone can reduce length of hospital stay in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. We would like to add some comments. Their study addressed a selected population. Of patients admitted to hospital with community-acquired pneumonia, only 43% were enrolled. Of these patients, those requiring admission to the intensive-care unit (ICU) were excluded from the analysis of the length of hospital stay.",

One of the criteria for discharge is body temperature-a measurement aff ected by systemic corticosteroids. The eff ect seen by Meijvis and colleagues could be the defervescence caused by the corticosteroids and not a true shortening of severity of disease. Additionally, we have found that a rebound fever can occur after cessation of dexamethasone, 2 and this fi nding has been corroborated. 3 No reference was made to duration in hospital and long-term follow-up of patients' body temperature.Moreover, dexamethasone could be detrimental. Non-steroidal antiinfl ammatory drugs given before admission to the intensive-care unit for community-acquired pneumonia have been associated with a more severe hospital course. 4 In Meijvis and colleagues' study, the number of patients who had empyema was greater in the dexamethasone group, as was the length of stay in the intensive-care unit. Although these values are not signifi cant statistically, they require attention before recommendations for the treatment of",
