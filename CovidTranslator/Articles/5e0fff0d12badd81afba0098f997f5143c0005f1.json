Avian coronavirus-infectious bronchitis virus (AvCoV-IBV) is an enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA virus, and belongs to the genus Gamma-coronavirus within the family of Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales [2] . The virus is spread mainly by aerosol, consumption of contaminated feed and water, and contact with infected feces or equipment. IB is characterized by various clinical signs in broilers and layer hens: coughing, sneezing, and decreased weight gain [4, 13] . Specifically, in layers, egg production can drop up to 70% with eggs that have shells that are wrinkled, thin, and soft. In young chicks, IBV infection can lead to oviduct cysts and reduced laying potential [2, 4, 9] .",

            "text": "The 27 to 28 kb genome of IBV encodes nine genes, which includes spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) [2] . The spike protein, a viral surface glycoprotein, was shown to induce neutralizing antibody response, and the nucleocpasid protein was shown to elicit strong antibody responses [2, 5] . Despite the presence and application of IBV vaccines in poultry, there is a high rate of emergence of antigenic variants and recombinant strains, and the lack of cross-protection between different viral genotypes, making disease control difficult and vaccine development rather challenging [15, 16] . Therefore, genetic characterization of circulating strains of IBV, appropriate vaccination programs, and application of sensitive diagnostic tests to detect and assess disease risk are important regional, national, and international strategies to control IBV infections [2, 8, 10, 21, 23] . Several ELISAs have been developed for detection of antibodies to IBV in chickens. Recombinant antigens used in these ELISAs were either based on the S1 protein [20] , which is highly variable, or the N protein and often produced in an E. coli expression system [15] . E. coli is a common flora or pathogen in chickens, thus creating the possibility of serological cross-reactivity and detection of false positives in these diagnostic assays. Thus, it is necessary to assess the suitability of other expression platforms for production of diagnostic antigens for use in IBV serology. The objectives of this study were to clone and express IBV N protein using the recombinant baculovirus expression system and assess its use as diagnostic antigen for serological diagnosis of IBV infection in chickens in Turkey.",

Following electroblotting of the proteins onto PVDF membrane, the blots were probed with mouse anti-His (C-Terminal)-HRP monoclonal antibodies (1.2 mg/ml) (Life Technologies) diluted 1:5000 to determine expression of the correct molecular size protein. Further confirmation of expression was performed using a mouse anti-IBV N (Massachusetts strain) monoclonal antibody (6 mg/ml) diluted 1: 2000 (Cat No. MBS312776; MyBioSource, San Diego, CA) and antiserum (at 1:50 dilution) collected from chickens naturally infected with local Turkish wild-type IBV strains. The membrane was then incubated with anti-species IgG-HRP secondary antibody conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) at 1: 5000 dilution, and specific signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) detection system. To assess the induction of specific IBV N-specific antibodies in the immunized chickens (described below), the antisera were tested in immunoblot assays. Approximately, 100 \u03bcl of sample containing approximately 5 \u03bcg of recombinant IBV N protein was diluted in 50-\u03bcl Laemmli sample dilution buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) and resolved in 12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel as described above. Following transfer, the blot was probed with IBV N antisera obtained from the chicks immunized with the recombinant IBV N protein at a dilution of 1:50 and with antisera from wild-type IBV-infected chicken at 1:50 dilution [19] . IBV negative chicken sera, at a dilution of 1:50, and mouse anti-IBV N monoclonal antibody (2 mg/ml) (Thermo Fisher, Cat. No. 7500891) at a dilution of 1:500 were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Thereafter, the blots were probed using goat anti-chicken HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (200 \u03bcg/0.5 ml) (Cat. No. sc2428; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) at a dilution 1:5000, and goat anti-mouse HRP conjugated secondary antibody (200 \u03bcg/0.5 ml) diluted 1:5000 (Cat. No. sc2005; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX). Reactivity was detected using 3\u2032-3\u2032-Diamino benzidine peroxidase substrate system (Sigma Cat no: D4418-5) as recommended by the manufacturer.",

This represents the first study in Turkey that expressed recombinant IBV N protein in baculovirus and examined its reactivity against antisera obtained from Turkish chickens for potential use as antigen Fig. 5 Detection of IBV N specific antibodies in sera obtained from naturally infected chicken (a) and vaccinated chickens (b) using an in-house IBV-N ELISA and a commercial ELISA. The cut-off value for inhouse indirect ELISA is set at OD 0.2, and for the commercial ELISA at S/P (sample to positive) ratio of 0.2 in serological investigation of IBV infection in domestic poultry. We have demonstrated that IBV N produced in a recombinant baculovirus expression system is immunogenic in local chickens and could detect IBV N-specific antibodies in sera obtained from chickens exposed to natural infection. The recombinant N protein was reactive in both immunoblot and indirect ELISA assays. The performance of the in-house indirect ELISA was comparable to the commercial ELISA tested in this study, indicating the potential suitability of recombinant baculovirus IBV N as a diagnostic antigen that could be used for serological risk assessment of IBV in domestic chickens in Turkey. Indeed, the N protein of IBV, in contrast to the S1 protein, has been associated with high stability and immunogenicity and has been used by others as a diagnostic antigen [1, 12] . The recombinant N protein used in the current study was based on nucleotide sequences of the Beaudette IBV strain. The reactivity of the recombinant IBV N protein with a monoclonal antibody (B819M) produced against the heterologous IBV Massachusetts strain, and with sera from local Turkish chicken indicate the conserved, cross-reacting nature of the N protein sequence and suggest potential broad cross-reactivity of the target protein among different IBV isolates and its suitability as a diagnostic antigen to detect IBV infection in local Turkish poultry. Other researchers have utilized recombinant IBV N expressed in various host systems in serological assays. For example, in a study performed by Pradhan and others [14] , IBV-N protein was produced using a prokaryotic expression system. The protein was used for diagnostic purposes and similar to this study, compared the performance with a commercial ELISA kit (IDEXX). The authors reported a 96.8% sensitivity and 95.8% specificity for the in-house ELISA based on the recombinant IBV N antigen and they concluded that an indirect ELISA based on the recombinant antigen is suitable for use in development of serodiagnostic tools [14] . In another study, the IBV-N protein was produced in both E. coli and baculovirus expression systems [3] , and the recombinant antigens were used in ELISAs to analyze chicken sera collected from farms [3] . Their data from screening of sera for the presence of IBV antibodies indicated that using the recombinant N protein as coating antigen could achieve equivalent performance to an ELISA kit based on extracts from infected material as coating antigen [3] .",

An in-house ELISA using the multi-fragment protein exhibited a 95.4% concordance with a commercial ELISA [6] . In the present study, recombinant IBV-N protein was produced using a baculovirus expression system and utilized as a diagnostic antigen in an indirect ELISA. The chicken sera from farms and the sera from immunized chickens were reactive with the recombinant antigen with comparable performance to a commercial ELISA test kit.",
