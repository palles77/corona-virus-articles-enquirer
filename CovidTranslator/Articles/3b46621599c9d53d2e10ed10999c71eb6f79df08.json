Conclusions: The proportion of RV involvement in CAP is higher than previously reported. The proportion of RV identifi ed in healthy subjects is signifi cantly lower than in CAP, but it is not zero and should be weighed when interpreting corresponding proportions among patients.",

Pneumonia was diagnosed only if both experts independently reported a pulmonary infiltrate in the acute phase radiograph that disappeared or retreated signifi cantly in the follow-up radiograph.

At the data analysis phase of the study, the patients were divided into the CAP or NPLRTI groups according to the presence or absence of pneumonia. None of the patients in the NPLRTI group underwent chest CT scan, so negation of CAP was based solely on chest radiographs. In the majority of patients with NPLRTI, the indication for hospitalization was decompensation of chronic comorbid disease and deterioration in an elderly patient's general condition due to the infection.

The sample size was calculated on the basis of these data to detect a difference among the three groups in the proportions of participants positive for at least one of the RVs, with an a level of 0.05 and a power of 80% using standard methods. According to those calculations, the study required at least 162 participants in of publications on this subject and even more so in the higher frequency and broader spectrum of RV identifi ed in adult patients with CAP in recently published papers compared with similar papers published in the past. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] The use of nucleic acid amplifi cation tests (NAATs) for the identifi cation of RV is a common factor in these recent studies. Today, researchers in this fi eld agree that this technique greatly increases the ability to identify RV in clinical samples compared with traditional methods, such as serology, viral culture, and immunofl uorescence. [2] [3] [4] [6] [7] [8] Furthermore, two important groups of RV, rhinovirus and coronavirus, only can be identifi ed by NAAT. 2, 3, 5, 9, 10 The previous studies focused on identifi cation techniques for RV while ignoring the effect of the sampling site and method on their yield. In addition, none of the recent studies included a control group of subjects without evidence of respiratory infection to facilitate a valid interpretation of the results. Thus, the objectives of the present study were (1) to identify RV in hospitalized adult patients with CAP using the NAAT technique and a combination of three sampling methods and (2) to compare the proportion and types of RV identifi ed in patients with CAP in two comparison groups, one group of healthy subjects without evidence of respiratory infection and the other including adult patients hospitalized for nonpneumonic lower respiratory tract infection (NPLRTI).",

The corresponding proportions from our study are within these ranges, except for RSV for which our proportion was higher than in previous studies. which was signifi cantly higher than among patients with CAP, could be attributed mainly to infl uenza viruses that were identifi ed in 31.3% of patients with NPLRTI.

In contrast to previous studies, this study ignored nonviral etiologies for CAP, which raises the question about whether the virus identifi ed in the patients with CAP was the sole etiology for CAP or whether bacterial and atypical etiologies could have been identifi ed as well in these patients and may have caused the clinical presentation and course of the disease.

            "text": "An additional methodologic limitation in the study is that the subjects were recruited over two winter periods and not continuously over all the seasons of the year. It is possible that this limitation of our study affected the results and should be taken into consideration when comparing them to those of the fi ve studies described herein, all of which were conducted continuously over all seasons of the year. Another methodologic limitation is the exclusive use of NAAT without regard for other traditional methods, including serology, viral cultures, and immunofl uorescence. Although each of those methods is less sensitive than NAAT, it is possible that testing of our samples by other methods would have increased the proportion of viruses identifi ed in our study population. During the planning stage of the present study, we were well aware of these limitations. The inclusion of the two comparison groups made the study population much larger than similar studies in the past. Furthermore, the decision to use three sampling methods increased",
