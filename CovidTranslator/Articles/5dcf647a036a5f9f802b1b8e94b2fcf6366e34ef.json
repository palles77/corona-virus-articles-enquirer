Medical virology has a relatively brief history, spanning just over a century, but it is crowded with intriguing discoveries, stories of immense personal courage and numerous practical applications, many of which have had an overwhelmingly positive benefit on humankind. Its origins involved the replacement of centuries-old beliefs and theories with discoveries borne out of rigorous scientific investigation. Targeted prevention and control strategies could only be developed and implemented once the concept of the specificity of disease causation had been accepted, namely that infectious diseases are caused not by some common miasma (a mysteriously poisonous substance), but rather by specific agents. In a wider sense, the microbial sciences have played a pivotal role in the development of medical thought overall, particularly in applying scientific rigor in understanding pathological processes. Advances in understanding infectious agents have led to improvements in human health and well-being that arguably have exceeded the contribution of any other branch of science. Indeed, no less than 35 workers in this and closely related fields have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in recognition of their achievements.",

For example, epidemics of smallpox, yellow fever, and polio myelitis, commonplace until well into the 20th century, have been virtually eliminated by the application of various prevention and control strategies. However, hitherto unrecognized diseases have emerged over the past halfcentury at the rate of at least one per year. Many of the viruses dealt with in this edition were unknown when the first edition was published over 45 years ago. The epidemiology of other viruses has radically changed as humans continue to alter the environment in so many ways. Meeting the challenges posed by emerging diseases requires the medical virologist to acquire ever more increasing expertise and access to ever more complex technologies. Today diseases such as HIV/ AIDS, hepatitis C, influenza, and diarrheal diseases represent significant threats to public health. Tomorrow it will be other diseases, the nature and means of control for which are largely unpredictable. One positive note is that all emerging viral diseases of recent years have been found to be caused by members of previously recognized families of viruses. Thus a thorough knowledge of representative members of each family is likely to facilitate and inform the rapid development of knowledge about any new pathogen.",

These filters originally were used to sterilize water and other fluids by preventing the passage of bacteria. Dimitri Ivanovsky (1892) and Martinus Beijerinck (1898) showed that the agent causing mosaic disease in tobacco plants (now known to be tobacco mosaic virus [TMV]) passed through ultrafilters retaining bacteria. Beijerinck realized he was dealing with something other than a microbe but erroneously thought that the entity that passed through the ultrafilter was an infectious liquid and not a particle-he called it a \"contagium vivum fluidum.\" Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch were the first to correctly conclude that an ultrafilterable infectious agent was indeed a submicroscopic particle. Studying the cause of foot-and-mouth disease of cattle, Loeffler and Frosch found that the causative agent passed through a Chamberland ultrafilter but not the finer Kitasato ultrafilter. Thus these first virologists saw ultrafiltration in a new way-they focused attention on what passed through the ultrafilter rather than what was retained, and thereby established an experimental methodology widely adopted in the early 20th century. In quick succession, further diseases were shown to be caused by ultrafilterable agents: in 1900 the first human virus, yellow fever virus, and its mosquito transmission cycle was discovered by Walter Reed, James Carroll and the US Army Yellow Fever Commission in Havana, Cuba, a discovery that was guided by the earlier work of the Cuban physician Carlos Findlay ( Fig. 1.2) .",

A major advance was the development of negative-contrast electron microscopy in 1959 by Sydney Brenner and Robert Horne. Using this method, electron-dense stains surround virus particles to produce a negative image of the virus with remarkable resolution; importantly in those early days of medical virology, the method was simple to use. Figs. 1.3 and 1.4 depict the diverse spectrum of morphological shapes represented by animal viruses. By the early 1960s, the fine structure of several viruses was unraveled by Aaron Klug, Donald Caspar, and others using X-ray crystallographythey showed that many viruses are constructed from uniform subunits, following the principles of icosahedral symmetry as first understood for the Platonic solids (regular polyhedra) by the ancient Greeks.

Notable developments included the attenuated yellow fever vaccine developed by Max Theiler in 1931, a vaccine that is still in widespread use today and has saved countless thousands of lives. Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin in 1954 and 1959 developed non-replicating (inactivated) and living attenuated virus vaccines against poliovirus, respectively, the use of which has been so extensive that poliovirus infection has all but been eradicated save for a few pockets of infection FIGURE 1.1 In 1881 and 1882, Louis Pasteur, Charles Chamberland, \u00c9mile Roux, and Louis Thuillier began their research toward developing a rabies vaccine. They modified Pierre-Victor Galtier's technique by inoculating nervous tissue from a rabid dog through a long series of dogs via subdural trephination. After many passages, they obtained a virus of maximum virulence and with a fixed incubation period of about 10 days. The degree of attenuation of virus recovered from each passage was measured and virus was then further attenuated in rabbits. This final attenuation procedure consisted of suspending the spinal cord of a rabid rabbit in a flask, in a warm dry atmosphere, to achieve slow desiccation. They succeeded in producing \"attenuated viruses of different strengths,\" the weakest of which could be used to prepare the first dose of a vaccine. Inoculating dogs with a sequence of spinal cords of increasing virulence rendered the recipients resistant to inoculation with fully virulent virus. Within a year, Pasteur and his colleagues reported the results of this treatment in 350 cases of rabies exposure-only one person developed rabies, and this a child who was treated 6 days after exposure. Over the next decades many thousands of people with potential rabies exposures were immunized with ever-improving animal nervous system (brain and spinal cord) vaccines, at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, which was founded in 1888, and in other locations throughout the world.

Viruses do not possess functional organelles (e.g., mitochondria, Golgi, chloroplasts, and endoplasmic reticulum), and thus are totally dependent on the host for the machinery of energy production and synthesis of macromolecules. Viruses contain only one type of functional nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA, never both, and differ from microorganisms in having a life cycle divisible into two clearly defined phases. Outside of the host cell, the viruses are metabolically inert and can be considered as complexes of large macromolecules; during this extracellular phase of the viral life cycle, virus transmission is dependent upon movements of air and fluid, and in some cases the life cycle of insect vectors. Once inside the host cell, however, viruses behave with many of the properties of living organisms; viruses are metabolically active in that the viral genome exploits the machinery of the host to produce progeny genome copies, viral messenger RNA, and viral proteins (often along with carbohydrates and lipids), all of which are then assembled to form new virions (virion, the complete virus particle). This assembly from pools of precursor molecules is in contrast to the multiplication of cellular organisms by binary fission. In contrast to any microorganism, many viruses can reproduce even if only the viral DNA or RNA genome is introduced into the host cell. These qualities have been used to argue the question, \"Are viruses alive?\" One answer is to envision viruses \"at the edge of life,\" in some ways fulfilling the criteria we use to define life, but mostly not.",

First, viruses may have originated as escaped eukaryotic genes, that is nucleic acid sequences, that evolved to encode protective protein coats to allow survival outside of the environment of the cell (transposons and retrotransposons have been suggested as the progenitors of retroviruses). Second, viruses may be degenerate forms of intracellular parasites, having lost most cellular functions (bacteria have been suggested as the progenitors of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and poxviruses); and third, viruses may have originated independently along with other primitive molecules and developed with self-replicating capabilities.",

For example, the genome of a plant viroid (a subviral agent comprised of infectious naked RNA), potato spindle tuber viroid, seems to be a self-replicating RNA copy of a part of the host potato DNA. Many of the genes of pox viruses are similar to those of eukaryote hosts. In any case, it seems certain from sequence analyses of viral genomes that all presently recognized viruses did not evolve from a single progenitor; rather, different kinds of viruses likely arose independently from different origins, and then continued to diversify and adapt survival and transmission qualities to better fit particular niches by the usual Darwinian process of mutation and natural selection.",

Since viruses use the replicative machinery of the host, virus infections present major challenges to antiviral drug development. Drugs that interfere with viral replication nearly always interfere with essential host cell functions. This is in contrast to bacteria, which have unique metabolic pathways different from those of the host, enabling these to be exploited as targets for antibiotics.",
