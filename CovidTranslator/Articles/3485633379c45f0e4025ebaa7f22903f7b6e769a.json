The results provide three lines of evidence suggesting that the spike glycoprotein is different from the other coronavirus proteins: (1) the spike glycoprotein is more sensitive to mutations, this is the current state of the spike glycoprotein, (2) the spike glycoprotein has undergone more mutations in the past, this is the history of spike glycoprotein, and (3) the spike glycoprotein has a bigger potential towards future mutations, this is the future of spike glycoprotein. Furthermore, this study gives a clue on the species susceptibility regarding different proteins.",

These proteins have the following functions: the hemagglutinin-esterase is the major receptor determinant, binding to sialic acid-containing receptors on the host cell and penetrating of virus genome into host cell cytoplasm by fusion of virus and host cell membranes. Both the envelope and membrane glycoproteins are components of the viral envelope that play a central role in virus morphogenesis and assembly via its interactions with other viral proteins. The nonstructural proteins mediate nuclear export of viral RNPs and bind RNA, thereby inhibiting host Electronic Supplementary Material is available for this article if you access the article at http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00894-004-0210-0. mRNA translation, and regulating viral pre-mRNA splicing and translation. The nucleocapsid protein is the major structural component of virons that associates with genomic RNA to form a helical nucleocapsid. The replicase polyprotein is a multifunctional protein containing the activities necessary for the transcription of negative stranded RNA, leader RNA, subgenomic mRNAs and progeny virion RNA as well as proteinases responsible for the cleavage of the polyprotein into functional products. The spike glycoprotein is responsible for both binding to receptors on host cells and for membrane fusion [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .",

By comparing the percentages of predictable and unpredictable portions among different proteins, we can find which protein has a larger unpredictable portion than others. Consequently this protein is more sensitive to mutations according to our previous studies [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Figure 1 shows the predictable and unpredictable portions in coronavirus proteins. This figure can be read as follows. The length of each bar presents 100%, which is located at both unpredictable and predictable sites separated by dotted line. For example, the unfilled bar in spike glycoprotein group presents the absent types, which are composed of 19.70% randomly predictable portion with interquartile range from 16.67 to 26.89% (right panel) and 80.30% randomly unpredictable portion with interquartile range from 73.11 to 83.33% (left panel). The statistical inference in Fig. 1 as well as Fig. 2 is conducted by using the ANOVA test to detect whether or not there is a difference among different proteins in a panel followed by a comparison test. For example, regarding the absent type in Fig. 1 , at first we use the Friedman ANOVA rank test whether or not there is a difference among different protein groups. Taking three bars in Fig. 1 into account, the spike glycoproteins have a larger unpredictable portion than others. These results suggest that the spike glycoprotein is more sensitive to mutations than other coronavirus proteins.",

Thereafter, we are particularly interested in the unpredictable portions (left panel in Fig. 1 ), because they are not engineered by randomness. As mentioned under Materials and methods, an unpredictable portion includes the unpredictable types and predictable types with unpredictable frequency, which can be presented as the actual values either larger or smaller than its predicted values. Our previous studies reveal that the unpredictable types whose actual value is larger than its predicted value are highly likely to be targeted by mutations, whereas the unpredictable types whose actual value is smaller than its predicted value are highly likely to be formed after mutations [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Figure 2 illustrates the percentage of unpredictable types and frequencies with respect to whether the actual value is larger or smaller than its predicted value in coronavirus proteins. Technically Fig. 2 is a subset of Fig. 1 obtained by classifying the data in the left panel of Fig. 1 into two criteria, i.e., the actual value is larger than the predicted value, or vice versa. In view of the unpredictable portion whose actual value is smaller than its predicted value (left panel), the spike glycoproteins have the largest percentages in both unpredictable type and frequency among different coronavirus proteins. Whereas in view of the unpredictable portion whose actual value is larger than its predicted value (right panel), the spike glucoprotein group reveals a larger percentage of unpredictable type accompanied by a smaller percentage of unpredictable frequency. This means that the spike glycoprotein might have undergone more mutations in the past than others.",

The scale of the vertical axes in Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 is shown logarithmically in order to emphasize the amino-acid pairs with large differences between the actual and predicted values. Due to the limitation of the graphic software, the filled forms are duplicated in one or two bars. However the data used in these figures can be found in the Supplementary Material. These figures can be understood as follows, the bars at two extremes along the horizontal axis present the amino-acid pairs sensitive to mutations, because our previous studies have shown that the larger the difference between actual and predicted values is, the more sensitive to the mutations is [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . By comparing the scales of horizontal axes from Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, we can see that the spike glycoproteins are more sensitive to mutations than other proteins because Fig. 9 Percent of unpredictable types and frequencies figure.

This supports our argument that the spike glycoprotein has undergone more mutations in the past. Moreover, if we look at the nine proteins which have been documented with more mutations (column IX in Table 2 ), we find that the percentage of unpredictable type in spike glycoproteins is statistically similar to the proteins in Table 2 (columns III and IV in Table 2 , similar to right panel in Fig. 2 ), but the difference regarding the percentage of unpredictable frequencies is statistical significant.

However we would like to argue that the host, the environment and the immune system are the external factors imposed on the spike proteins, while the internal factor in the spike proteins, which is particularly interesting to us, is the structure that can be partially explained by our random approach. In another study on the spike protein, we specifically discussed the spike proteins from three human coronaviruses classified with our approach and gave predictions of possible and potential mutation forms regarding the spike protein structure [7] . At this stage of study, it is still difficult to define the reason and to give a biological explanation to the results that the absent types in the spike protein behave differently from and opposed to other proteins, although we have discussed the biological explanation in the present types in rat monoamine oxidase B in the past [38] . However it is certain that the randomly unpredictable absent types should be deliberately eliminated from a protein rather than being self-organized and selfempowered. This is so because such an absence cannot be explained by randomness which suggests the least time-and energy-consuming.",

This finding can be correlated with hemagglutinin and neuraminidase from influenza A virus. Both hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are surface proteins, and subject to the pressure of the antibody and the selective pressure for the appearance of host cell variant with altered receptor binding specificity. Meanwhile the spike glycoprotein is responsible for both binding to receptors on host cells and for membrane fusion. In this viewpoint, the spike glyprotein is quite similar to hemagglutinin and neuraminidase.",

            "text": "The multiple sequence alignments are a phenomenological technique by comparing the similarity among proteins. The phenomenological analogy can be classified into at least three types. For the simplest example, we compare the letters that construct a word to guess the meaning of the word. Another type of phenomenological analogy is equivalent in physical laws, for example, Fick's law and Kirchhoff's law are equivalent to the law of conservation. The third type of phenomenological analogy is mathematically similar, for example, the transfer of energy, mass, heat and momentum can be described by using similar differential equations. [39, 40] In fact, what the multiple sequence alignments are doing is language similarity. On the other hand, our approach is a mechanism-driven technique by calculating the randomly predictable and unpredictable portions in a protein. Our approach is not a phenomenological tool, and is studying the internal power engineering the mutations. Multiple sequence alignments cannot predict BTK human Bruton's tyrosine kinase, CA54 human collagen a5(IV) chain precursor, FA9 human coagulation factor IX precursor, GLCM human bglucocerebrosidase, HBA haemoglobin a chain, LDLR human low-density lipoprotein receptor, PH4H human phenylalanine hydroxylase protein, VHL Von Hippel-Lindau disease tumor suppressor, RUN1 human acute myeloid leukemia 1 protein, ADHA human alcohol dehydrogenase a-chain, CTGF human connective tissue growth factor, GSHR human glutathione reductase, AOFB human monoamine oxidase B, LIS1 human platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase a-subunit, TNFA human tumor necrosis factor, TYRO human tyrosinase, ATTY human tyrosine aminotransferase, AMPC_ CITFR Citrobacter Freundii b-lactamase, DOPO human dopamine b-hydroxylase, I percent of unpredictable portion of present types, II percent of unpredictable portion of present frequencies, III percent of unpredictable present types whose actual values are smaller than predicted values, IV percent of unpredictable present frequencies whose actual values are smaller than predicted values, V difference between actual and predicted values in unpredictably present types whose actual values are smaller than predicted values, VI difference between actual and predicted values in unpredictably present frequencies whose actual values are smaller than predicted values, VII difference between actual and predicted values in unpredictably present types whose actual values are larger than predicted values, VIII difference between actual and predicted values in unpredictably present frequencies whose actual values are larger than predicted values, IX number of mutations the future, while our approach can predict the likelihood of future mutations. Technically, multiple sequence alignments need a large database for searching, while our approach needs a few data but a large amount of calculations. In general, multiple sequence alignments are the first step for the understanding of proteins, DNA, etc., and science must advance to seek other new techniques for the understanding of proteins, DNA, etc. However, our approach at this moment is only related to the primary structure, therefore it cannot give information on loop regions, as multiple sequence alignments also cannot. With respect to the evolutionary pressure, our approach is using the randomly unpredictable portion to account, as we argue that the randomly unpredictable portion should be deliberately developed through the evolutionary process. This is so because randomness suggests the least time-and energy-consuming to construct proteins.",
