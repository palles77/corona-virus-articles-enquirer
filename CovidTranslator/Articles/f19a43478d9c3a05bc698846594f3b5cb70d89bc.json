To elucidate the potential causes of the increase in CD4+CD8+ i-IEL with age, we analyzed the specificity of the CD4+CD8+ i-IEL and influence of intestinal micro flora on the increase in this subset in aged rats. The purified CD4+CD8+ i-IEL proliferated in response to DnaK [Escherichia coli (E. coli) HSP70] in the presence of mitomycin-c (MMC)-treated syngeneic spleen cells. The proportion of CD4+CD8+ T cells in whole i-IEL were significantly increased in aged rats fed commercial (CL-2) diet but not in those fed home-made (purified) diet under conventional condition. No CD4+CD8+ i-IEL were detected in aged rats under germfree condition, irrespective of diet feeding. A larger number of Enterobacteriaceae, especially E. coli, were detected in the intestinal contents and feces from aged rats with CD4+CD8+ i-IEL compared with those from aged rats fed without CD4+CD8+ i-lEL. The unique CD4+CD8+ i-IEL population specific for E. coli HSP may be associated with long term exposure to intestinal E. coli in aged rats.",

The unique CD4+CD8+ i-lEL bearing TCRa~ were found to respond to HSP70 derived from Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the presence of syngeneic APC. The CD4+CD8+ population expanded in the i-IEL of aged rats in association with the increased number of Enterobacteriaceae, especially E. coli, in the contents of small intestine and feces.

To confirm these earlier findings, we first examined the proliferative responses of whole i-IEL from 6 month-old Wistar rats against E. coli HSP70 (DnaK) in the presence of syngeneic antigen presenting cells (APC). Consistent with our previous report with F344 rats (15) , the i-lEL from the aged Wistar rats showed proliferative response in the presence of MMCtreated syngeneic splenocytes, whereas such response was not detected in the i-IEL of young (8 week-old) Wistar rats (Fig. la) . The proliferative response of CD4+CD8+ i-IEL respond to E. coli hsp 70 . 555 the aged rats i-IEL was significantly enhanced (p < 0.05) in response E. coli HSP70 (Fig. 1 b) , but those of the young rats did not respond to the HSP70. To further determine which cell population in the i-IEL from aged rats was able to respond to the bacterial HSP70, we purified CD4-CD8+ i-IEL and CD4+CD8+ i-IEL from aged rats by using EPICS\u00ae Elite ESP of COULTER cell sorting system. The purity of each subset was 99.3% for CD4-CD8+ i-IEL or 97.5% for CD4+CD8+ i-IEL (Fig. 2a) . As shown in Figure 2b , the purified CD4+CD8+ i-IEL responded to syngeneic spleen cells and much more vigorously to HSP70 in the presence of syngeneic spleen cells, whereas CD4-CD8+ i-IEL showed little, if any, proliferation in response to HSP70 with syngeneic spleen cells.",

After staining with various mAbs, the i-IEL were examined by FCM analysis. A representative FCM profile from 5 rats of each group was shown in Figure 3 and the data were summarized in Table 3 . In 6-month old rats bred under conventional conditions, which were fed CL-2, a much larger proportion of CD4+CD8+ i-IEL were detected (Fig. 3a, Table 2 , p < 0.005). Although most of the i-IEL expressed TCRa~ in these rats, an appreciable number of CD3+ TCRa~i-IEL corresponding to TCRyb i-IEL were detected in the i-IEL (Fig. 3b) . The CD3-TCRa~i-IEL were also detected at an appreciable level in the rats. The CD3-TCRa~-CD4-CD8-i-IEL did not belong to B cells because they did not express surface 19 as accessed by staining with anti-IgK chain mAb (data not shown). The CD4+CD8+ cells were reported to be detected, albeit only a few, in the GALT including PP and lamina propria in mice (10) . To confirm that the CD4+CD8+ i-IEL were really located within the epithelium, we carried out immunohistochemical analysis of the small intestine of aged conventional rats. Two color staining using naphtol and DAB revealed that CD4+ i-lEL coexpressed CD8 in these rats (Fig. 4a) . The CD4+CD8+ i-lEL were detected at the intraepithelium and preferentially located at the lateral surface in the longitudinal sections of villi from the terminal ileum, whereas these CD4+CD8+ i-lEL were rare in the crypts or dome epithelium overlying PP (Fig. 4b, 4c , and data not shown).",

As shown in Figure 5 , only a few CD4-CD8+ i-IEL expressed CDS, which is a pan T cell marker, but all CD4+CD8+ i-IEL expressed much the same intensity of CDS as the peripheral mature T cells, suggesting that the lineage of CD4+CD8+ i-IEL may differ from that of CD4-CD8+ i-IEL. The phenotype of i-IEL from aged rats fed home-made diet under conventional conditions were found to be quite different from those fed CL-2. The i-IEL consisted of a large number of CD4-CD8+ cells and appreciable numbers of CD4-CD8-cells and CD4+CD8-cells but very few, if any, CD4+CD8+ cells (Fig. 3a) . Thus, these results suggest that the composition of a diet may deeply influence the increase in the CD4+CD8+ i-IEL with age.",

Our present data suggest that the responders to the bacterial HSP are a CD4+CD8+ i-IEL subset, which are increased in aged rats of various strains. Furthermore, this unique subset is able to respond to HSP70 derived from E. coli, which is one of major members in intestinal microflora.

The CD4+CD8+ i-IEL were detected in aged rats fed CL-2 diet but hardly detected in aged conventional rats fed home-made diet. Two possibilities can be brought forward to explain the difference between aged rats fed CL-2 diet and those fed home-made diet. The first possibility is that CL-2 may contain antigens capable of directly stimulating CD4 +CD8+ i-IEL. The second possibility is that the different diets may cause differences in the composition of the microflora, which may affect the selection of CD4+CD8+ i-IEL. Our results with aged germfree rats, fed a CL-2 diet or home-made diets suggest that stimulation with intestinal microflora, rather than antigens present in a CL-2 diet, is important for the expansion of the CD4+CD8+ i-IEL. Interestingly, aged rats fed on a CL-2 diet contained a large number of E. coli in microflora, which may express DnaK E. coli HSP70. Taken together, these results suggest that an unique CD4+CD8+ i-IEL population may be selected by HSP70 through long term exposure to intestinal E. coli. So far, we do not know why rats who fed home-made contained fewer Enterobacteriaceae but a larger number of H2S-producing bacteria in their microflora as compared with those fed on a CL-2 diet. Major differences in the composition of these two diets were the amount of vitamins and amino acids. The differences in various compositions of diets and the mutual interaction of microflora may be responsible for the different compositions of the microflora between rats fed on a CL-2 diet and those fed home-made diet.",

Immature CD8+ T cell precursors in the thymus are reported to acquire CD4 during differentiation in vivo and in vitro (37, 38) . Recent studies, which were examined with athymic nude mice, scid mice, and RAG gene knock-out mice repopulated with T celldepleted bone marrow cells, have revealed that a significant fraction of i-IEL can differentiate independently of the thymus (3, 39) . It is assumed that the CD8+ i-JEL may differentiate to CD4+CD8+ i-IEL at the local site of intestine under the influence of stimulation with intestinal microflora. On the other hand, there is evidence that activation and culturing of human CD4+ T cell clones in IL-4 resulted in the acquisition of CD8 due to its de novo synthesis (40) . Therefore, it is alternatively possible that CD4+CD8+ i-IEL may originate from CD4+ cells. IL-4 is known to have an ability to induce expression of Ia on B cells and macrophages. CERF-BENSUSSAN et al. (33) reported that IFN-y but not IL-2 appear to contribute to induction of Ia on intestinal epithelium. Stimulation with intestinal microflora including E. coli HSP70 may activate the i-lEL to produce both la-inducing and CD8-inducing cytokines, resulting in appearance of CD4+CD8+ i-IEL and Ia intestinal epithelium in aged conventional rats fed CL-2 diet.",

Therefore, CD4+CD8+ i-lEL may contain cells responding to the bacterial antigens in a MHC class I-restricted CD8-dependent manner. The cytolytic activity of i-IEL is known to be regulated by externally derived stimuli via a specific functional interaction between i-IEL and gut-associated antigens (21) . Expression of CD8 is reported to be important for anti-CD3 directed cytolytic activity by the CD4+CD8+ T cell clones (37) . The CD4+CD8+ i-lEL have been recently reported to display a high level of cytolytic activity upon TCR triggering (23) . Taken together, the CD4+CD8+ i-IEL may play important roles in the first line of defense against various pathogens in epithelium through recognizing them. And they may be presented by MHC class II in a CD4dependent manner and through their cytolytic activities against MHC class 1restricted antigens.
