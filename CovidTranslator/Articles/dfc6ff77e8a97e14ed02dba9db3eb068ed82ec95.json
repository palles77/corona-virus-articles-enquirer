            "text": "The aim of this study was to explore the predictive implications of the composition of immune cell populations prior to lenalidomide plus high-dose dexamethasone (Len-Dex) initiation for the occurrence of infections. We prospectively examined immune cell populations in peripheral blood taken at baseline of lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (Len-dex) therapy and reviewed clinical and microbiology records in 90 patients with refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma (RRMM). Risk factors for infection were analyzed using logistic regression. During a median of 11 cycles of Len-dex treatment, 52 (57.8%) patients experienced at least 1 infection episode. Of a total of 92 episodes of infection, 58 (63%) episodes were clinically defined, 29 (31.5%) episodes were microbiologically defined, and 5 (5.4%) episodes were fever of unknown origin. Severe episodes were more frequently observed during the first 3 cycles. After adjusting for risk factors for infection based on univariate analyses, multivariate analyses showed that lower Hb (< 10 g/dL) was a clinically independent factor associated with occurrence of infections. Lower frequency (P = 0.044) and absolute count (P = 0.014) of circulating CD3 + CD4 + CD161 + cells prior to Lendex treatment were also associated with the occurrence of infection, especially during the first 3 cycles of Len-dex therapy. In addition to several clinical predictive factors, we found that CD3 + CD4 + CD161 + cells may provide additional information for predicting the occurrence of infection in the early period of Len-dex therapy.",

A large longitudinal cohort study that The et al. conducted in patients with MM receiving current standard treatment with proteasome inhibitors (PIs), immune-modulatory drugs (IMiDs), and autologous stem cell transplantation revealed high-risk factors for infection such as late disease, multiple treatments, intensive combination systemic chemotherapy, and corticosteroid dose [9] .",

The treatment paradigm has shifted with the use of small biologic molecules (PIs, IMiDs and HDAC inhibitors). The effects of these drugs on the immune system are distinct from those of conventional anti-myeloma agents, resulting in changes in the types and patterns of infections. In particular, the combination of lenalidomide and high-dose dexamethasone (Len-Dex) demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with relapsed/refractory MM in two large, welldesigned pivotal clinical trials [10, 11] . After that, lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (Len-dex) led to better overall survival and lower toxicity than Len-Dex in patients with newly diagnosed MM [12] and also remains the standard of care in the relapsed or refractory setting. Therefore, we analyzed the patterns and risks of infection in patients with RRMM during Len-dex treatment and sought to identify immune cell subtypes related to the occurrence of infection using multicolor flow cytometric analysis of fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from RRMM patients prior to Len-dex initiation.",

Optimal cutoffs for continuous variables were identified using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.

The results from two pivotal clinical trials found that the incidence rate of infection (\u2265 grade 3) was approximately 10 to 20% in patients with RRMM receiving Len-Dex [10, 11] . Although the use of low-dose dexamethasone has reduced toxicity while preserving the efficacy of Len-Dex [12] , Kim et al. reported incidence rates (\u2265 grade 3) of febrile neutropenia, sepsis, and pneumonia of 4.6, 2.7, and 9.1%, respectively, in 110 Korean patients with RRMM in which dexamethasone 160 mg per cycle was most commonly used [18] . Herein, we demonstrated that 52 (57.8%) out of 90 patients experienced at least 1 infection episode during Len-dex treatment, and severe episodes were frequently observed during the first 3 cycles. Our observations of an increased risk of infections in the early treatment period are consistent with findings from previous studies. Many studies, which were conducted before the development of the novel agents, have demonstrated an increased risk of infections in early courses, particularly within 4-6 months following treatment, and a decreased risk of infections after achieving a favorable response to treatment [19] [20] [21] . In patients with MM receiving bortezomib-based treatment, early course therapy was associated with the development of severe bacterial infections [22] . In addition, considering the disease-related and treatmentrelated immune deficits in patients with RRMM, we explored immune cell subsets in association with the occurrence of infection in order to evaluate their emerging potential as cell biomarkers. In this study, lower Hb (< 10 g/dL) was a clinically independent factor associated with the occurrence of infections, and lower frequency (P = 0.044) and absolute count (P = 0.014) of CD3 + CD4 + CD161 + cells in the peripheral blood prior to Len-dex were associated with the occurrence of infection, especially during the first 3 cycles of Lendex therapy.",

Kleber et al. showed A unique finding in our study was the suggestion of an immune subtype as a predictive biomarker for the occurrence of infection, especially during the early period of therapy. CD161 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein with characteristics of the C-type lectin superfamily. This receptor is expressed on NK cells, 25% of all adult peripheral T cells, more than 90% of all peripheral blood monocytes, and on in vitro-derived dendritic cells [24] . We previously evaluated the association of CD161-expressing T cells with the development of acute graft-versus-host disease (AGVHD) after allogeneic SCT and found that a low proportion of CD8 + CD161 + cells and a high ratio of CD4 + CD161 + cells to CD8 + CD161 + cells from peripheral blood at engraftment were associated with the occurrence of AGVHD, with evidence of higher expression of the Th17 transcription factor ROR\u03b3T in CD4 + CD161 + T cells rather than CD8 + CD161 + T cells [25] . Within the CD4 + subset, CD161 expression is associated with IL-17 production [26] , but other IL-17-producing T cells, such as CD8 + and CD4 \u2212 CD8 \u2212 double-negative T cells also, express CD161 [27] . Until recently, there has been an agreement that CD161 receptors on NK cells play an inhibitory role [28] [29] [30] , whereas the role on T cells lacks consensus. Recently, we reported that the proportion of pretransplant circulating CD3 + CD4 + CD161 + cells in the allogeneic stem cell transplant setting was associated with the occurrence of neutropenic inf e c t i o n s , w h i c h s u g g e s t e d t h e i m p o r t a n c e o f CD3 + CD4 + CD161 + cells in the rapid immune response to microorganisms before establishment of the post-transplant immune system [31] . The relation between pretransplant CD3 + CD4 + CD161 + cells and the occurrence of early complications was also seen in autologous stem cell transplant setting [32] . In this study, we found that the presence of preexisting CD3 + CD4 + CD161 + cells may play an important role in decreasing the risk of severe infection in patients with RRMM during Len-dex therapy.",

However, there is no data on immune subtypes as a predictive factor for infection in RRMM patients treated with Len-dex. Evidence about the prophylactic use of antibiotics in non-neutropenic MM patients is still inconclusive [35] , and prophylactic antibiotics raise the concern of the emergence of antibiotic resistance [36] . Therefore, the prophylactic use of antibiotics may not be needed for all MM patients, but rather only by patients at high risk for the occurrence of infection.",

At baseline, the CD3 + CD4 + CD161 + T cell frequency was 4.00 \u00b1 0.28%, which significantly decreased to 2.86 \u00b1 0.26% (P = 0.005) and 2.72 \u00b1 0.29% (P = 0.004) after the 2nd and 3rd cycles of therapy, respectively. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM and t tests were used to compare the continuous variables a risk of varicella zoster virus infection in lenalidomidetreated MM patients as well as bortezomib treatment or transplants and demonstrated risk factors including suppressed lymphocyte subsets, substantial cell-mediated immune defects, and compromised humoral immune response[23]. Our observations provide specific data on the type of infection and factors affecting infectious complications in patients treated with Len-dex. While the lower frequency and absolute count of CD3 + CD4 + CD161 + cells were associated with an increased risk of infection during the early period of therapy, CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 + , NK cells, and MDSCs were not associated with an increased risk of infection. Among various clinical parameters, serum creatinine, Hb, and serum albumin levels were identified as potential factors related to the occurrence of infection.",
