Indeed, even the identification of the causative agent as a virus (that is, capable of passing through a filter) rather than the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae (championed by some leading microbiologists at the time) was in dispute until late in the course of the pandemic 1 . The 1918 virus had an estimated case fatality rate of 10-20%, spread to six continents, infected ~500 million people and killed approximately 3% of the world's population 2, 3 . The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus pandemic of 2002-2003, the first pandemic of the twenty-first century, had a case fatality rate of near 10%, but infected far fewer people (8, 096 ) than the H1N1 influenza virus of the 1918 pandemic 4 . Transmissibility, as estimated by R 0 (the basic reproduction number; that is, the number of cases generated through contact with one infected individual) was similar for the influenza pandemic of 1918 (R 0 = 2-3) 5 and the SARS pandemic of 2003 (R 0 = 2-5) 6, 7 . However, the global response to SARS was facilitated by advances in epidemiology and microbiology that",

This reflects not only factors that enable the appearance and globalization of new microbial infections, but also improvements in methods for ascertaining the cause of a new disease. Innovative molecular diagnostic platforms, investments in pathogen surveillance (in wildlife, domestic animals and humans) and the advent of social media tools that mine the World Wide Web for clues indicating the occurrence of infectious-disease outbreaks are all proving to be invaluable for the early recognition of threats to public health. In addition, models of microbial patho genesis are becoming more complex, providing insights into the mechanisms by which microorganisms can contribute to chronic illnesses like cancer, peptic ulcer disease and mental illness. Here, I review the factors that contribute to infectious-disease emergence, as well as strategies for addressing the challenges of pathogen surveillance and discovery.",

Whereas two large teams invested weeks using classical dideoxy sequencing techniques to characterize SARS coronavirus genetic material that had been amplified in tissue culture 8, 9 , the high-throughput sequencing platforms that have been used in more recent outbreaks, such as the Lujo virus outbreak in South Africa in 2008, have allowed the identification of novel agents in clinical materials in only 48-72 hours 10 . As a consequence of the globalization of travel and trade, infectious agents are expanding their geographical ranges and appearing in new contexts. Thus, clinicians and public health officials must be prepared to detect and respond to the unexpected. The ongoing development of new antimicrobial drugs, therapeutic antibodies, vaccines and probiotics means that early and accurate disease diagnosis can have profound implications for medical management and public health. This is particularly true for viral infections, for which, until recently, opportunities for effective intervention were limited to HIV, hepatitis C virus and herpesvirus infections. Surveillance and discovery efforts are bearing fruit in chronic disorders and in studies of normal physiology, as well as in the investigation of acute diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, meningitis, encephalitis and haemorrhagic fevers. The role of Helicobacter pylori in causing peptic ulcers 11 , the role of human papillomavirus in cervical cancer 12 and the role of polyomaviruses in Merkel cell carcinoma 13 are prominent examples of the microbial contributions to the pathogenesis of disorders that were idiopathic only a few years ago. Insights into the role of the human microbiome in nutrition, allergies and autoimmunity have led to the implementation of the same surveillance and discovery platforms that are used to investigate classic infectious diseases 14, 15 . Finally, although there have been no recent examples of bioterrorism, the risk has only increased with political instability and with the accessibility of synthetic genomics techniques that enable the creation or re-creation of virulent pathogens.",

However, genetic methods have moved to the forefront in microbial surveillance and diagnostics [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . The foundation for most of these methods is PCR, which was developed in 1983 by Kary Mullis (TIMELINE). PCR requires minimal equipment and operator training, can be completed in minutes rather than days, is less expensive than culture and has been adapted to portable instruments that can be used in the field in developing countries or near a patient's bedside. Furthermore, like other genetic methods, PCR might succeed in detecting an organism that has fastidious requirements which confound cultivation. Most PCR assays that are approved for clinical applications test for the presence of a single type of bacterium or virus. Such assays, described as singleplex, are used to screen for any evidence of infection (for example, to find hepatitis B virus in blood products to be used for transfusion) or to quantify microorganism levels when assessing a response to therapy (for example, to determine the HIV burden in the serum or plasma of subjects receiving antiretroviral medication).",

The emergence of high-throughput sequencing over the past decade has enabled the discovery of new microorganisms, the rapid resolution of the causes of infectious-disease outbreaks and the development of metagenomics, a field in which investigators inventory the complex microbial communities found in humans, domesticated animals, wildlife, plants and various environments. Although high-throughput sequencing was initially confined to specialized laboratories owing to the high costs of instruments and supplies, along with the requirements for specially trained personnel, recent technical improvements have increased access to this technology to a broader segment of the research community. One index for the evolution of sequencing technology is the per-base cost, which decreased from $5,000 per megabase in 2001 (using classical dideoxy methods), to $15 per megabase in 2008 (using pyrosequencing; see DNA Sequencing Costs: Data from the NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP)), to $0.50 per megabase in 2012 (using the Illumina platform 49 ). Another index is the time required to obtain sequence data. Metagenomic analyses 42, 55, 56 have revealed dynamic microorganism-host relationships that influence normal physiological processes -for example, digestion 57,58 and the immune response 59 , which might be factors in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases 59 and cancer 56 -and that probably also contribute to global climate regulation through effects on marine plankton 60 . The challenge now is not in obtaining sequence data but in analysing it. Millions of sequence reads must be assembled into continuous strings of genetic information and identified as originating from a particular microorganism or host by using algorithms that search for similarity between the sequences obtained from metagenomics and those already catalogued in existing databases. Few investigators currently have the in-house processing power and expertise required for these types of analyses; however, access to large computer clusters can be achieved through cloud computing and high-throughput sequencing software that is rapidly becoming more user friendly.",

Whereas passive surveillance uses data that already exist or are collected routinely, active surveillance involves a new investment in and/or new processes for microorganism collection and analysis. A classic example of passive surveillance is the concept of reportable diseases. Most regional and national public health authorities maintain lists of infectious diseases for which laboratory tests indicative of infection must be reported (see CDC National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System). These diseases include those characterized by human-to-human transmission, such as sexually transmissible diseases (for example, syphilis or gonorrhoea) and vaccine-preventable diseases (for example, measles), as well as those for which detection indicates the presence, in the environment, of an infectious agent that poses a substantial threat to public health, such as haemorrhagic fever viruses or highly pathogenic bacteria (for example, Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic plague). On the non-human side, agricultural authorities monitor infections such as foot-and-mouth disease, which have important economic implications. Passive surveillance is informative and inexpensive, but might underestimate the true frequency of an agent or a disease. Furthermore, by definition, it cannot detect the risk of infection with a particular pathogen before the onset of symptoms.",

In some instances, the connection is immediately apparent because precedent supports plausibility -for example, finding a new type of Ebola virus in an individual with a haemorrhagic fever, or a new strain of Vibrio cholerae in a diarrhoea outbreak. However, in other instances, the link is more tenuous. Host factors can have a profound impact on susceptibility to infection and the consequences thereof. Agents that are normally innocuous can have high morbidity and mortality rates in individuals with immunological deficits, whether those deficits are due to genetic mutations, age, malnutrition, a co-occurring infection (for example, HIV/ AIDS), or complications of cancer treatment or transplantation.",

More difficult to recognize are instances in which the expression of microbial toxins has remote effects, or infection induces immune responses to the microorganism that break tolerance to self. Clostridium spp., for example, can infect the skin or gastrointestinal tract and produce toxins that act on the nervous system to cause spasms (Clostridium tetani) 72 or flaccid paralysis (Clostridium botulinum) 73 .

            "text": "The best established criteria for proof of causation were formulated by Loeffler and Koch in the 1880s. Popularly known as Koch's postulates 75 , these criteria require that an agent be present in every case of the disease, be specific for the disease and be sufficient to reproduce the disease after culture and inoculation into a naive host. Rivers 76 modified these postulates by acknowledging that the presence of neutralizing antibodies to an agent is evidence of infection. Fredericks and Relman 77 noted that pathogens can often be recognized by molecular methods before they can be cultured, and therefore allowed as evidence the presence of microbial sequences as well as of infectious microorganisms. Thus, although Koch's postulates remain the gold standard, they need not be fulfilled to implicate an agent in a disease. Indeed, a focus on Koch's postulates might impede the successful discovery of, and response to, emerging pathogens and the development of models for infectious disease. Through the discovery and characterization of nearly 500 viruses, my colleagues and I have developed a three-level scoring system for establishing the level of confidence in a particular association, from possible to definitive (BOX 2) . Poor design or execution of pathogen discovery projects can lead to spurious links being made between infectious agents and diseases, and this can result in the use of inappropriate and potentially dangerous treatments or the rejection of health-promoting interventions such as vaccines 42 . The effort required to break these links can be greater than that invested in building them, particularly for disorders with a grim prognosis and/or limited treatment options. From our experience with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (linked to enteroviruses), mental illness (linked to bornaviruses), autism (linked to the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine) and myalgic encephalomyelitis-chronic fatigue syndrome (linked to both xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus and polytropic murine leukaemia virus), we have developed a strategy to try and acquit microorganisms by addressing social as well as scientific considerations",

It took an additional 4 years to determine the genomic organization of the virus 96, 97 . With specific cloned reagents in hand, I reasoned that it would be straightforward to determine whether BDV was indeed a human pathogen; however, the issue lingered until 2012, when blinded multicentre analyses, both molecular and serological, ultimately revealed no evidence of human infection 98 .",
