            "text": "Allochthonous inputs are important sources of productivity in many food webs and their influences on food chain model demand further investigations. In this paper, assuming the existence of allochthonous inputs for intermediate predator, a food chain model is formulated with disease in the prey. The stability and persistence conditions of the equilibrium points are determined. Extinction criterion for infected prey population is obtained. It is shown that suitable amount of allochthonous inputs to intermediate predator can control infectious disease of prey population, provided initial intermediate predator population is above a critical value. This critical intermediate population size increases monotonically with the increase of infection rate. It is also shown that control of infectious disease of prey is possible in some cases of seasonally varying contact rate. Dynamical behaviours of the model are investigated numerically through one and two parameter bifurcation analysis using MATCONT 2.5.1 package. The occurrence of Hopf and its continuation curves are noted with the variation of infection rate and allochthonous food availability. The continuation curves of limit point cycle and Neimark Sacker bifurcation are drawn by varying the rate of infection and allochthonous inputs. This study introduces a novel natural non-toxic method for controlling infectious disease of prey in a food chain model.",

            "text": "Mathematical epidemiology is an important branch of science as it is essential to determine the patterns, causes, and effects of health and disease conditions in defined populations. Populations are prone to various bacterial and viral diseases in every ecosystem. These diseases have a significant influence on the dynamical evolution of the concerned population. This has prompted the need to study the impact of epidemiological parameters from mathematical as well as ecological point of view. There were significant developments in the theory and applications of epidemiological models of predator-prey systems [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] in the last two decades. Mathematical models have a long history in infectious disease ecology starting from Bernoulli's [8] modelling of smallpox and including Ross's [9] analysis of malaria. Pioneer works on mathematical modelling of infectious disease was done by Kermack and McKendrick [5] [6] [7] . These papers had a major influence on the development of mathematical models forinfectious disease and are still relevant in many epidemic situations. There are many famous mathematical models which are related with important human infectious diseases e.g., HIV [10] , malaria [11, 12] , SARS-coronavirus [13] and influenza [14] . Mathematical models are also being used to explore wildlife disease dynamics [15, 16] and possible routes of zoonotic disease emergence. A predator-prey system with infected prey in polluted environment was investigated by Sinha et al. [17] . Anderson and May [18] were probably the first who considered the disease factor in a predator-prey dynamics and observed that pathogen tends to destabilize the predator-prey interaction. Hadeler and Freedman [19] determined a threshold of infection rate above which an infected equilibrium or an infected periodic solution appear in Rosenzweig prey-predator model. Many eco-epidemiological models are investigated by several researchers considering various types of interactions between the populations [20, 21] . Chattopadhyay and Arino [22] formulated three species eco-epidemiological model and they studied local stability of equilibrium points, extinction criteria of species and determined the conditions for Hopf bifurcation in an equivalent twodimensional model. Haque and Chattopadhyay [23] investigated the role of transmissible diseases in a predator-prey system with infected prey. Bhattacharyya et al. [24] proposed and investigated an epidemiological model considering nonlinearity in infection incidence. Liu et al. [25] had done the bifurcation analysis of a predator-prey model with disease in prey and they reported various bifurcation scenarios of the system. Yongzhen et al. [26] investigated effect of delay on a predator prey model with parasitic infection. Recently, various disease control strategies are introduced to control infectious disease in food chain model [27, 28] . Seasonal variation of infection rate is an important factor in disease modelling. Modelling and analysis of the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis without and with seasonality was investigated by Bowong et al. [29] .",

            "text": "Disease control has relied heavily on the application of chemical fungicides, bactericides and soil fumigants over the last 50 years. Now there are many problems associated with their continued deployment forces us to reduce use of chemicals in the environment in general. Consequently, applications of alternative non-chemical methods of disease control continues to gain importance. It is well known that most predators not only feed a single prey rather move for alternative foods also. Polis and Strong [30] reported that the alternative resources and pathways plays central role in food web dynamics. Unexpected consequences of predator removal was observed experimentally by Sih et al. [31] and Cote & Sutherland [32] . They found that predator removal reduced prey populations in many cases. Several experimental studies [33, 34] had shown that predators can easily capture diseased prey. If predators eliminate the most infectious individuals from the prey population then that will have an outcome equivalent to quarantine, whereby infectious individuals are removed from the ecosystem and thereby prevented from disease spreading. Therefore, predator control has significant effect on food chain model with infected prey. Allochthonous inputs to predators help to increase predator population in a food chain. Some investigations [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] were done either providing alternative food or considering allochthonous inputs to predator in a predator-prey system. Recently, Sahoo and Poria [40, 41] reported the consequences of alternative food for predator in a diseased predator-prey system. They showed that an diseased system may becomes disease free in presence of additional food up to some threshold infection rate. But disease controlling aspects of allochthonous inputs to intermediate predator in a three species food chain model is unexplored. Starting from a well studied tritrophic food chain model [37] , we investigate the disease controllability aspects of allochthonous inputs in this paper. The bifurcation phenomena of the model are analysed with respect to important biological parameters for finding periodic and other behaviours [42] of the model.",

In next Section, the model formulation is done. In Section 3 the conditions for positivity and boundedness of solutions are derived. Stability conditions of all equilibrium points are derived and extinction criterion of infected prey population are calculated in the Section 3. Persistence condition of the system is derived in Section 4. In Section 5 the numerical simulation results of the model are presented and the effects of seasonal variation of contact rate on the model is also investigated. Numerically, one and two parameter bifurcation results using MATCONT 2.5.1. software [43] [44] [45] are presented in Section 6. Finally, conclusion is written in Section 7.",

The supply of allochthonous inputs remain constant. The parameters can be deemed biologically plausible as they represent realistic predator-prey ratios in body size found in surveys [46, 47] . Polis and Hurd [48] suggested that for an island system most of the allochthonous inputs are available to intermediate predator population only. There are many other systems which are driven by allochthonous inputs to the intermediate predator population include marine filter-feeding communities in unidirectional currents or invective areas [49] , soil communities [50, 30] and headwater streams which received leaf litter inputs [51] .

            "text": "It is well known that seasonal variations in temperature, rainfall and resource availability strongly influence infectious disease dynamics due to variation of contact rate. London and Yorke [59] and Yorke et al. [60] have computed seasonal contact rates for various diseases. Both London and Yorke [59] and Yorke et al. [60] showed that for monthly data, the contact rate appears to be smooth and periodic with a period of about one year. London and Yorke [59] demonstrated that seasonality is necessary for perpetuating a recurrent epidemic, so we will concentrate on examining the effects of variation d in the model (3) . In order to investigate the qualitative effects of seasonality, we assume the infection-rate is set by the parameter d\u00f0t\u00de [61] [62] [63] and incorporates time-dependent external factors affecting the contact rate between members of the population and the infectivity of the disease in the model (3). We assume d\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc d 0 \u00bd1 \u00fe d 1 sin\u00f02pt\u00de [60] [61] [62] , where d 0 is the average contact rate-constant, d 1 represents the strength of the seasonal forcing between zero and unity and t has units of years. Note that the sinusoidal forcing may strongly influence the long term behaviour [64] . Here, we investigate the effects of seasonal variation of contact rate in the disease dynamics of prey population in presence of allochthonous inputs. The bifurcation diagrams with respect to d 1 of infected prey are presented in Fig. 9 with random positive initial condition using MATLAB software (see Appendix G for algorithms of numerical simulations). From Figs. 9(a) and 9(c), we observe that the infection of prey population exists for seasonally varying d 1 in absence of allochthonous inputs to intermediate predator. On the other hand, in presence of allochthonous inputs the system becomes disease free (Figs. 9(b) and 9(d) ). Therefore, allochthonous inputs to intermediate predator may be very useful to remove disease in prey population in case of seasonally varying contact rate also.",

We study the existence of periodic orbits bifurcating from equilibrium points of the system (3). This phenomenon is know as a generalized Hopf bifurcation [65] . This is actually done by studying the change in the eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix and also following the continuation algorithm. We consider a set of fixed point initial solution, s 0 \u00bc 0:22982797; i 0 \u00bc 0:77209572; p 10 \u00bc 0:15448232 and p 20 \u00bc 1:1231164, corresponding to a parameter set of values as in Table 1 . The characteristics of Hopf point, the limit cycle and the general bifurcations are explored using the software package MATCONT2.5.1. [43] [44] [45] . In this package we use prediction-correction continuation algorithm based on the Moore-Penrose matrix pseudo inverse for computing the curves of equilibria, limit point (LP), along with fold bifurcation points of limit cycles etc (see Appendix G for algorithms of numerical simulations).",

In the Fig. 10 To proceed further we start from the first Hopf point (H 1 ) which is predicted in Figs. 10 and 11 as the initial point at d \u00bc 0:675168, and using the backward continuation process we get a family of stable limit cycles bifurcating from this Hopf point. This phenomenon is shown in Fig. 12 , where again the infection rate d in the system is the Table 2 Parameter values of d and A at the bifurcation points in Fig. 10 and 11 , together with normal form coefficients and eigenvalues [66] . Table 3 Limit cycle bifurcation with respect to d in Fig. 12 , together with first Lyapunov coefficients [66] . Table 2 . We list periods of limit cycle oscillations together with normal form coefficients (Fig. 12) in Table 3 . Now, we investigate codimension 2 bifurcation sequences with d and A as bifurcation parameters. We now consider our starting point to be the first Hopf point (H 1 ) occurring at d \u00bc 0:675168, in Fig. 10 . Applying forward and backward continuation techniques, we observe generalizedHopf (GH) points and doubleHopf (HH) point considering d and A as free parameters and this phenomena is presented in Fig. 13 Table 4 Parameter values of d and A at the bifurcation points in Fig. 13 , together with normal form coefficients and eigenvalues [66] .

This is happening because infected prey is weaker than susceptible prey and is easily captured by intermediate predator. This will reduce the number of infected prey and ultimately the system may becomes disease free at certain stage for low infection rate without allochthonous inputs. But for higher infection rate (d P 0:62), the disease free system can not be obtained in absence of allochthonous inputs. However, the bifurcation analysis with respect to infection rate proves that the system becomes disease free in presence of suitable allochthonous inputs for higher infection rate (Figs. 6 and 7) . If intermediate predator eliminate the most infected individuals from the prey population then it has an outcome equivalent to quarantine and prevent disease spreading among prey species. Allochthonous inputs to intermediate predator helps to increase its population size which helps to eat infected prey at higher rate. In this way allochthonous inputs to intermediate predator is very useful for controlling disease of prey population in a food chain model. We also consider seasonally varying contact rate and show that the system becomes disease free there in presence of suitable allochthonous inputs. Therefore, we may conclude that allochthonous inputs can control infectious disease of prey in a food chain model. We draw infected and uninfected region in the parameter plane as a function of infection rate and allochthonous inputs.",

Existence of Hopf (H), double-Hopf (HH), generalized Hopf (GH) bifurcation with the variation of infection rate and allochthonous inputs are noticed. We have shown that the system also undergoes branching, period doubling, and Neimark-Sacker bifurcations. The first Lyapunov coefficient is computed to determine the nature of Hopf bifurcations in the model. The local representation of a Neimark-Sacker (NS) bifurcation curve is determined. We observe some critical bifurcation points like: 1:1 Resonance (R1), 1:3 Resonance (R3) and 1:4 resonance (R4) in the model with the variation of infection rate and allochthonous input. Therefore, many qualitatively different dynamical behaviours are observed in the model with the variation of infection rate and allochthonous input.",

            "text": "The key observation is that allochthonous inputs to intermediate predator can control infectious disease of prey in a food chain model if the death rate due to predation is lower than disease induced mortality of prey. If predators eliminate the most infectious individuals from the prey population then that will have an outcome equivalent to quarantine, which can prevent disease spreading among prey. Actually, the supply of allochthonous input increase the population of intermediate predator and then it can captures infected prey at higher rate and as a result, after certain time the system becomes disease free. Considering a parasite infected food chain model Packer et al. [67] showed that predation will increase prey population size when the force of predation is lower than prey mortality. On the other hand if the death rate due to predation is higher than prey mortality then negative effects of allochthonous inputs will be expected. Notice that allochthonous inputs never increase the disease of prey but may not control the infection of the prey at high infection rate (for example see Fig. 8 ). Results presented in this paper are important to understand the role of allochthonous inputs as a natural disease controller of infected prey in a food chain model. The possible interesting aspects for future developments are to investigate the role of allochthonous inputs as a disease controller in food chain models with other type of functional responses between intermediate predator and infected prey and also with different types of infection spreading rule. The role of allochthonous inputs to control infectious disease of prey in a network of infected food chain models are also an important area for future developments. This novel natural non-toxic method of disease control may be very useful for biological conservation of prey species and also for developing new strategies for controlling infectious disease of prey in a real world biological systems.",

We now discuss about the equilibrium curve of the system for fixed A \u00bc 0:8. For A \u00bc 0:8, we observe two Hopf point, one branch point in the positive quadrant. The first Hopf point (H 1 ) is located at \u00f0s; i; p 1 ; p 2 ; d\u00de (0.269218, 0.861629, 0.156250, 1.239693, 0.675168) with eigenvalues \u00f0\u00c00:0473243 AE i0:173118; AEi0:365186\u00de. For this Hopf point the first Lyapunov coefficient turns out to be \u00c00.008568927, indicating a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. Indeed, there are two complex eigenvalues of the equilibrium with real k 3;4 % 0 at this parameter. First Lyapunov coefficient is negative implies that a stable limit cycle appears when equilibrium point looses stability (see, Appendix D for general procedure of existence of Hopf bifurcation). As the parameter is increasing, second Hopf point \u00f0H 2 ) is situated at \u00f0s; i; p 1 ; p 2 ; d\u00de \u00f00:134544; 0:509303; 0:156250; 0:797909; 1:350987\u00de. For this second Hopf point the first Lyapunov coefficient turns out to be \u00c00.05326441.
