Antiviral resistance to available drugs such as adamantanes or neuraminidase inhibitors has appeared rapidly 6-9 , creating a need for new antiviral targets and new drugs for influenza virus infections. Using forward chemical genetics, we have identified influenza A nucleoprotein (NP) as a druggable target and found a small-molecule compound, nucleozin, that triggers the aggregation of NP and inhibits its nuclear accumulation. Nucleozin impeded influenza A virus replication in vitro with a nanomolar median effective concentration (EC 50 ) and protected mice challenged with lethal doses of avian influenza A H5N1. Our results demonstrate that viral NP is a valid target for the development of small-molecule therapies.",

Over half of the indi viduals infected by the H5N1 subtype died irrespective of treatment with both classes of drug 7-9 . In our previous studies on SARS corona virus, we demonstrated that a forward chemical genetics approach using a chemical library of 50,240 compounds with diverse structures could interrogate most known targets for viral infection 10,11 . Here we screened the same library using MadinDarby canine kidney (MDCK) cell-based influenza A infection assays and identified 950 compounds that showed protective effects as primary hits.",

Furthermore, nucleozin effectively inhibited viral growth even when added within 6 h after inoculation of the MDCK cells with the virus (Fig. 1d) , indicating that the antiviral activities of nucleozin reside on postentry and postnuclear events, suggesting that multiple processes involving NP may be affected, although only the nuclear import process of NP can be readily observed.",

Antiviral resistance to available drugs such as adamantanes or neuraminidase inhibitors has appeared rapidly [6] [7] [8] [9] , creating a need for new antiviral targets and new drugs for influenza virus infections. Using forward chemical genetics, we have identified influenza A nucleoprotein (NP) as a druggable target and found a small-molecule compound, nucleozin, that triggers the aggregation of NP and inhibits its nuclear accumulation. Nucleozin impeded influenza A virus replication in vitro with a nanomolar median effective concentration (EC 50 ) and protected mice challenged with lethal doses of avian influenza A H5N1. Our results demonstrate that viral NP is a valid target for the development of small-molecule therapies.",

To localize the binding site of nucleozin to NP, escape virus mutants resistant to nucleozin were selected with increasing concentrations of nucleozin. We were not able to obtain escape mutants by using nucleozin as the selecting agent but an escape mutant showing crossresistance to nucleozin was obtained after five passages of selection using compound FA1. The resistant viral clone was plaque purified and selected for further studies. It is noteworthy that in the absence of nucleozin, the viral titer of the resistant mutant was only slightly lower than the parental virus under low (0.001) multiplic ity of infection (MOI) conditions (Supplementary Fig. 7 ) but about an order of magnitude lower than the wildtype virus when a high MOI of 7 was used (unpublished observations). We speculate that the escape mutant virus may produce more defective interfering particles at high MOI but this observation may be applicable only to this Y289H mutant and not be generalized to other strains of influenza virus. Furthermore, although the mutant virus seemed to be less fit for infection in MDCK cells when compared with wildtype WSN virus, we caution that the fitness of a laboratoryinduced mutant virus could only be meaningfully evaluated in the context of relevant animal models.",

Results from the luciferase reporter-based minigenome assay 18 further showed that concentrations of nucleozin that effectively abolished the replication of the virus had little effect on the Y289H variant NP (Fig. 2d) . The results from minigenome assays also indicated that the replication activity of the Y289H was about 20% lower than the wildtype NP, which might explain the lower NP signal in Y289H immunofluores cence studies (Fig. 2c) . When we used purified recombinant wildtype NP or Y289H NP in a nuclear import assay 19 , the nuclear import of the wildtype NP was abolished in the presence of nucleozin (Fig. 2e) , indicating that nucleozin acts on NP in the absence of other viral components.

            "text": "Influenza A NP has six tryptophan residues scattered through out the protein. Binding of exogenous molecules is likely to induce a change in the microenvironments of tryptophan molecules leading to a change in intrinsic fluorescence. Fluorescence spectroscopy showed that incubation of nucleozin with purified recombinant NP elicited a clear dosedependent fluorescencequenching effect, indicating that nucleozin binds to influenza A NP and that this binding may induce conformational changes in the protein. Fluorescence titration using the Y289H variant NP resulted in a much lower fluorescencequenching effect, suggesting that the binding of nucleozin to the Y289H variant NP is much weakened but not totally abolished (Fig. 3a) . The docking model (Supplementary Fig. 4) suggests that residue N309 of NP forms a hydrogen bond with nucleozin, and residue Y289 forms hydrophobic interactions with nucleozin by aromatic ring stacking. Replacement of tyrosine by histidine at position 289 presumably disrupts the ring stacking effect and destabilizes the binding of the nucleozin to NP. As the experimental results with the Y289H mutant virus agreed with the predicted binding of nucleozin to NP, the small groove behind the body ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 4 ) of NP is likely to be critical to the binding of nucleozin. Sequencing the NP gene of ten independent nucleozinresistant clones from our mutant raising experiment has shown that nine clones are Y289H mutants. One clone carried a N309K instead of the Y289H mutation. This second resistance mutation reconciles well with the original predictions of the docking model ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 4) , suggesting that N309 may stabilize the binding of nucleozin through hydrogen bonds.",

We speculate that the binding of nucleozin to influenza NP may induce conformational changes in the protein that render NP unsuitable (Fig. 3b) but caused a dosedependent reduction of NPRNA complex that could be run into the 4-12% polyacrylamide gradient gel (Fig. 3b,c; lanes 3-6) . The result suggested that nucleozin induced the formation of very large NPRNA aggregates that were too big to get into the gradient gel during electrophoresis. The NP in the assay was not lost on account of degradation; this was apparent when we separated the reaction content by denaturing SDSPAGE under reducing conditions and detected intact NP (Supplementary Fig. 8) , indicating the presence of NP aggregates that could be dissolved in denaturing conditions. In the absence of RNA, the nucleozin treat ment could also reduce the amount of NP running into the native gradient gel in a dosedependent manner as judged by the intensi ties of Coomassie blue-stained NP in each lane (Fig. 3d, lanes 1-5) , presumably due to formation of very large NP complexes. Separating the reaction content by denaturing SDSPAGE demonstrated that the NP was present at comparable levels in treated and untreated samples and detectable under denaturing conditions (Supplementary Fig. 9) . The data suggest that although nucleozin alone induced NP aggre gate formation, the presence of RNA in the system greatly enhanced the formation of very large NPRNA complexes nonresolvable by native electrophoresis. The Y289H variant NP, on the other hand, was inert to the addition of nucleozin, in the absence or presence of RNA (Fig. 3c, lanes 7-10; Fig. 3d, lanes 6-10) .",

Analyzing all the publicly available NP sequence of human H1, H2, H3, H5, H7, H9 influenza A subtypes revealed that although Y289H is a rare polymorphism in influenza A viruses, the newly emerged SOIV is a natural Y289H variant. Among 525 Y289H variants detected in H1N1 viruses, 512 belong to the SOIV (Supplementary Tables 1-3) . The SOIV has high resistance to nucleozin (EC 50 > 50 \u03bcM; data not shown) in MDCK cell infection models but a close analog, compound FA10, of nucleozin has shown promising antiviral activity against the Y289H variant and the SOIV, with EC 50 = 11.3 \u00b1 0.9 \u03bcM and 5.0 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcM, respectively. FA10, however, has reduced activity toward the wildtype WSN virus, with EC 50 = 15.3 \u00b1 2 \u03bcM ( Supplementary  Fig. 10) .

Nucleozin induces the formation of NP aggregates and antagonizes its nuclear accumulation, leading to cessation of viral replication. Investigation of other nucleoproteins of other viruses as direct druggable targets for smallmolecule therapeutics is warranted.",

The HTS data was transferred to a Dell Precision 500 Workstation and normalized by custom designed data analysis software in two stages. For stage one normalization, each well was divided by the median of each plate and a normalized value was obtained for each well. As the HTS was carried out in triplicate, the second stage normalization took into account the variation between each well and the final reading was calculated by aver aging the two closest readings. This twostage normalization method mini mized potential experimental errors, which are usually random and sporadic in nature. Secondary screening. Secondary screening was carried out in triplicate in 96well tissue culture plate (TPP) at 10 \u03bcg/ml. Selected compounds were first dispensed in the wells, followed by the addition of 20,000 MDCK cells and 200 PFU of influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus into each well. The plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 and monitored daily using a Leica DM inverted light microscope for virusinduced cytopathic effect. Compounds that gave full protection of MDCK cells (no cytopathic effect) were selected for further studies. The cytotoxicity of selected compounds was determined by MTT assay according to manufacturer's instructions.",

The threedimensional structure of nucleozin was then generated by Chem3D (CambridgeSoft). Hydrogen atoms were assigned and Sybyl Mol2 files for Autodock were prepared by InsightII (Accelrys), and partial charge and potential were assigned by CHARMM force field. Autodock3.0.5 Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm and its default parameters were used for docking. After carrying out docking, models of the complexes of nucleozin interacting with influenza NP were obtained. CHARMM force field was used to optimize the docked complexes by removing bad contacts between the ligand and the protein. PyMol (Delano) was used to plot the modeling figures.",

All DNA sequencing was carried out in the Genome Research Center (University of Hong Kong).Generation of recombinant influenza virus by reverse genetics. The pHW2000 eightplasmid system was used to generate desired recombinant viruses 17 . The eight plasmids contain the cDNA of the eight segments of the influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) genome: pHW2000PB2, pHW2000PB1, pHW2000PA, pHW2000HA, pHW2000NP, pHW2000NA, pHW2000M and pHW2000NS. Standard PCRbased techniques were used to clone the mutation in the NP gene of the escape mutant into the BsmI sites of pHW2000NP. On the day before transfection, confluent 293T and MDCK cells were trypsinized and cocultured in a sixwell tissue culture plate (TPP). TransIT Oligo Tranfection Reagent (Mirrus) was used to transfect the co cultured 293T and MDCK cells according to manufacturer's instructions. The infectious particles from the supernatants were harvested 48 and 72 h posttransfection, and the recombinant virus titer enumerated in MDCK cells by plaque assay.Luciferase reporter assay for polymerase complex activity. The luciferase reporter assay was performed as previously reported 18 . Fulllength genomic segments of NP, PA, PB1 and PB2 derived from different virus strains were cloned into pHW2000 vector. RNP complex comprised of WSN wildtype NP or Y289H variant NP, PA, PB1 and PB2 were cotransfected into 293T cells with a luciferase reporter plasmid, pYHLuci, which contains noncoding sequence from the M segment of influenza A virus and firefly luciferase gene driven by polI. Plasmid phRLTK (Promega), which expresses Renilla luci ferase, was also cotransfected as an internal control for data normalization. At 2 h after transfection, different amounts (final concentrations: 1-25 \u03bcM) of nucleozin (in DMSO) were added to the transfected cells. As a solvent control, some volume of DMSO was added to a final concentration of 0.5%. At 24 h after transfection, the luciferase activities were measured using Dual Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega E1910) and Victor3 multilabel plate reader (Perkin Elmer).NP nuclear import assay in MDCK cells. The assay was done as described 19 . MDCK cells were seeded on glass coverslips and were washed with import buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 110 mM potassium acetate, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM sodium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate and 2 mM dithiothreitol) before being permeabilized with 20 \u03bcg/ml of digitonin (Sigma) for 5 min at 25\u00b0 C. Meanwhile, 25 \u03bcM of NP with or without 10 \u03bcM of nucleozin were preincubated for 5 min at 25\u00b0 C. After washing off the digitonin with import buffer, the NPnucleozin mixture was added to the permeabilized cells and incubated for 30 min. The energygenerating system (0.4 mM ATP, 0.45 mM GTP, 4.5 mM phosphocrea tine and 18 U/ml phosphocreatine kinase (Merck)), 15% rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), 1.6 mg/ml BSA (Sigma) and protease inhibitors (Roche) were subsequently added to the cells and incubated at 37 \u00b0C CO 2 incubator for another 30 min. The cells were then rinsed with import buffer and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were immunostained as described above. The images were visualized using confocal microscropy (Carl Zeiss).Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used to examine the effect of nucleozin on the RNA binding activity of the NP proteins. Purified recombinant wildtype WSN or Y289H variant NP proteins were incubated with nucleozin at 25\u00b0 C for 30 min, then a 24nucleotide RNA oligomer 16 was added and incubated for another 30 min. Nucleasefree water was added, up to 10 \u03bcl. Final concentration of small RNA oligomer was 2 \u03bcM and molar ratio of NP/RNA was kept at 4:1. After incubation, the samples were mixed with 3 \u03bcl 6\u00d7 DNA loading dye (0.25% bromophenol blue, 0.25% xylene xyanol, 40% sucrose) and loaded into sample wells of nondenaturing 4-12% gradient BisTris NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen) equilibrated by preelectrophoresis at 50 V in 1\u00d7 TBE. Samples were separated by electrophoresis at a constant voltage of 150 V for 35 min at 25\u00b0 C in 1\u00d7 TBE. The gel was first visualized by ethidium bromide staining for RNA shift patterns followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue G250 for NP shift patterns. For examining the effects of nucleozinNP interac tions in vitro in the absence of RNA, we used NativePAGE 4-16% BisTris gradient gel (Invitrogen) for the separation of NP under native conditions accordingly 30 .Animal experiments. As previously described 22 , we kept the 5 to 7weekold BALB/c female mice in biosafety level 3 housing and gave the mice access to standard pellet feed and water ad libitum. All experimental protocols followed the standard operating procedures of the approved biosafety level 3 animal facilities and were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee. One group (nine mice) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 100 \u03bcl of 20 mg/ml of zanamivir (GlaxoSmithKline), a second group (nine mice) was injected with 2.3 mg/ml of nucleozin, and the untreated group (nine mice) was injected with PBS 1 h before inoculating the mice intranasally with 5 LD 50 (100 PFU) of the A/Vietnam/1194/04 H5N1 virus in 20 \u03bcl 2 mg/ml zanamivir, 0.23 mg/ml of nucleozin or PBS. Two doses per day of i.p. 100 \u03bcl of 20 mg/ml zanamivir, 2.3 mg/ml of nucleozin or PBS were given for 7 d. Animal survival and general conditions were monitored for 21 d or until death. Three mice in each group were euthanized randomly on day 6 postinoculation and lungs were removed for determination of viral titers by plaque assay.",
