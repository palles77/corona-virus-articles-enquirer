For such interventions to be 17 contemplated they need to comprise drugs that are efficacious when given to adults and for which 18 extensive human safety data are available. Here we show that dramatic lifespan extension can be 19 achieved in C.elegans by targeting multiple, evolutionarily conserved ageing pathways using drugs 20 that are already in human use. By targeting multiple synergistic ageing pathways, we are able to slow 21 ageing rate, double lifespan and improves healthspan while minimize developmental and fitness trade-22",

Employing 24 lipidomics and transcriptomics analysis we found lipid metabolism to be affected resulting in 25 increased monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and decrease membrane peroxidation index. Our best 26 drug combination showed a conserved lifespan extension in fruit flies. To the best of our knowledge, 27 this is the largest lifespan effect ever reported for any adult-onset drug treatment in C. elegans. This 28 drug-repurposing approach, using drugs already approved for humans to target multiple conserved 29 aging pathways simultaneously, could lead to interventions that prevent age-related diseases and 30 overall frailty in a rapidly ageing population.",

In model organisms, mutations affecting these pathways can often extend lifespan 35 by between 30% and 100% 7,8 . Combining different genetic mutations can result in synergistic lifespan 36 extension 9-11 . By contrast, the effect of pharmacological interventions are typically much weaker, even 37 when targeting the same pathways 2,12,13 , but this genetic synergy suggests a potential strategy for the 38 design of novel pharmacological interventions by simultaneously targeting multiple evolutionarily 39 conserved ageing pathways. To date there is little data on synergistic effects of pharmacological 40 interventions on lifespan 14 . Here we report an in vivo approach to design novel multi-drug ageing 41 interventions. We show how multi-drug interventions leverage pathway synergies to maximize effect 42 size, while minimizing side effects and detrimental developmental tradeoffs through targeting distinct 43 but interacting ageing pathways. Our ultimate aim was to design a purely pharmacological, adult-44 onset intervention with lifespan efficacy similar or better than those of canonical aging mutations did.",

We therefore developed our candidate drug 47 combinations in a short-lived model organism, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Using our 48 approach, we identify two triple drug combinations that extend lifespan and healthspan to an extent 49 greater than any previously reported pharmacological intervention in C. elegans 13 . Our synergistic 50 drug combinations show effect sizes comparable to the classical ageing mutations while avoiding 51 most of the tradeoffs associated with them 19-21 . We find that these interventions actually increase some 52 markers of performance while slowing biological ageing rate. Moreover, we identified TGF as a key 53 contributor and required pathway in mediating these synergistic effects. We also find that worms 54 treated with synergistic drug combinations have higher MUFA:PUFA ratios and a decrease in 55 membrane lipid peroxidation index. Finally, we confirm that this synergistic effect is also present in 56 the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Table S1 ).

While transcriptional analyses revealed significant overlap between affected genes, we also 98 identified sets of genes that were unique to each individual compound (Fig. 2a) .

Using this definition, we identified two synergistic combinations out of the ten 125 pairs tested (Fig. 2c, 170 Several of the drugs tested have previously been reported to be CR mimetics 17,32-34 . We therefore 171 tested each synergistic combination and its constituent compounds in a C. elegans model of CR (eat-2 172 mutants). We found that only RIF among the single drug treatments further extended lifespan in eat-2 Table S3 ). First we explored the transcriptomics data for changes that 223 might affect lipid composition and found that synergistic drug combinations indeed resulted in a 224 significant up regulation of the C. elegans SREBP-1c homologsbp-1, a master transcription factor 225 controlling several lipogenic genes, and genes coding for \"desaturases\" responsible for MUFA 226 synthesis 38-40 (Fig. 4c ,e). We then employed an MS-based lipidomics assay to determine changes in 227 lipid compositions that might result from these drug treatments.

This means that their health span was significantly 255 extended both in absolute and relative terms. Indeed, more than half of the treated animals were still 256 in optimal health even after the last control animal had died (Fig. 5d, Extended data Fig. 9c ).",

Moreover, treated animals experienced improvements in resistance 261 to heat and oxidative stress (paraquat) assays, (Figure 5e The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/153205 doi: bioRxiv preprint 8 limited detected tradeoffs, but also improved health span, increased stress resistance, and even 264 increased physical performance. Such observations raise the important question if these lifespan 265 benefits are due to an actual delay in biological ageing rate. The rate of ageing can be expressed as 266 mortality rate doubling time (MRDT). We determined MRDT of animals exposed to synergistic drug 267 combinations using Survcurv 53 , and found MRDT to be significantly longer in RIF+PSORA+ALLAN 268 treated animals compared to controls (MRDT of control = 3 days and RIF+PSORA+ALLAN = 3.7 269 days, P value < 0.0001). The initial mortality rate was significantly lower for both synergistic should be noted that cohort size of flies was smaller than for worms and that we did not re-optimize 294 drugs for the fly experiments. However, these data confirms that some of the detected synergies 295 appear to be evolutionary conserved.",

This effect size is comparable to that of the classical 301 ageing mutations and, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest reported for any adult-onset 302 pharmacological intervention 13 . However, unlike in ageing mutations we detect very limited 303 detrimental evolutionary or fitness tradeoffs associated with this lifespan extension by drug synergies 304 19 . In particular, we did not detect any decrease in oxygen consumption or total fecundity. The latter 305 result is consistent with a previous study showing benefits of an adult-onset intervention using 306 resveratrol without reduced fecundity 56 . These data suggest that there is significant post-9 controls (Fig. 5g) . Mortality analysis suggests that one synergistic drug treatment slows basic 311 biological ageing rate by ~20% (Extended data Fig. 10 ). To test for evolutionary conservation, we 312 determined lifespan benefits in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, confirming qualitative 313 conservation for two of the four synergistic drug combinations. Nematodes are evolutionarily more 314 distant from fruit flies than they are from mammals 57 , making mechanisms and pathways conserved 315 between flies and nematodes ancient, and tracing this synergy back to a common ancestor of all three 316 clades.",

This further 145 supports the notion that ALLAN has a unique mode of action 22 . Therefore, we tested addition of 146 ALLAN to the two synergistic double combinations. This addition resulted in significant additional 147 mean and maximum lifespan extension in both cases (Figures 2f,g, Extended data Fig. 3d-f and 148 Supplementary Table S2). The best triple combination (RAP, RIF, ALLAN) doubles mean lifespan, 149 resulting in a median lifespan of up to 44 days and a maximum lifespan of 50 days (Supplementary 150 Table S2). This effect size is comparable to the canonical ageing mutations and is, to the best of our 151 knowledge, the largest lifespan extension ever reported in C. elegans with any adult-onset drug 152 intervention 29 . By contrast, addition of ALLAN to the non-synergistic combination (RAP+PSORA) 153 did not show any further benefit (Extended data Fig. 3c). Finally, to test whether, despite its high 154 overlap in terms of gene expression changes, addition of MET would results in any further lifespan 155 benefit on dual combinations, we add MET as a third component to one of the synergistic dual 156 combinations RAP+RIF. However this triple combination (RAP+RIF+MET) 16/FOXO is a transcription factor that plays a key role in lifespan determination in model 161 organisms and likely also in humans 30,31 .

Only RIF+PSORA resulted in further lifespan extension and addition 176 of ALLAN, a second CR mimetic, did not result in further benefits. 177 To further explore the mechanism of drug synergy we determine the transcriptome profile for each 178 synergistic combination and selected non-synergistic drug combinations. Transcriptomic analysis in 179 worms treated with single, double and triple drug exposure for the synergistic and non-synergistic 180 combinations revealed that the transcriptome of CR mimetic single drugs is clustered together with 181 eat-2, whereas the non-CR mimetic RIF is different from eat-2 and from all other single drugs (Fig. 182 2h). Interestingly, the transcriptomes of synergistic combinations are clustered together and the 183 pattern is different from those of their constituent single drugs and from that of eat-2 mutants (Fig. 2h, 184 Extended data Fig. 4c,d). Moreover, we found that only on pathway, transforming growth factor beta 185 (TGF ), was commonly enriched in all synergistic dual and triple combinations (Fig. 4a, Extended 186 data Fig. 6c, 7a, Supplementary Table S4) relative to untreated control. To identify pathways that 187 were further enriched by the drug combinations relative to their constituent single drugs, we used the 188 single drug transcriptome as background control (see methods) for pathway analysis. Using this 189 approach, we found that all synergistic combinations, again, affected TGF amongst the pathways 190 differentially impacted relative to their parent drugs while none of the non-synergistic combinations 191 did so (Supplementary Table S5). Because some drug combinations resulted in further lifespan 192 extension in eat-2 mutants relative to their constituent drugs, we tested whether TGF was enriched in 193 the transcriptomes of N2 animals treated with synergistic drug combinations relative to untreated eat-194 2 worms. Again, TGF was the only pathway enriched in all synergistic combinations (Extended data 195 Fig. 7bSupplementary Table S6).

Previously it has been shown that TGF (daf-7) mutation 202 extends lifespan via insulin signaling and that both daf-2 and daf-7 regulate the transcription of daf-16 203 dependent genes 35 (Extended data Fig. 7d). To test the role of the IGF pathway in this effect and to 204 determine if the lifespan of already long-lived daf-2 mutants could be further extended using our drug 205 combinations, we first determined lifespan of daf-2 mutants for each combination. Only the RAP-206 based combinations, RAP+RIF and RAP+RIF+ALLAN, showed lifespan extension in daf-2 mutants. 207 However, the effect size was similar to that of RAP alone and none of the combinations resulted in 208 further synergy (Fig. 3c, Extended data Fig. 8, Supplementary Table S2). PSORA treatment alone 209 extended the lifespan of daf-2 mutants, but none of the PSORA based combinations, RIF+PSORA 210 and RIF+PSORA+ALLAN, extended lifespan in daf-2 mutants (Fig. 3c and Extended data Fig. 8). To 211 test our hypothesis that TGF was involved in mediating drug synergies, we next tested the efficacy 212 of all synergistic combinations and their components in daf-7 mutants.

Furthermore, TGF /daf-7 219 regulates triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism 37 and daf-7 mutants are known to store more fats 36 . 220 These links in conjunction with our transcriptomics data led us to investigate whether treatment with 221 synergistic drug combinations resulted in modifications in lipid profiles consistent with TGF 222 inhibition.

Because of these changes, there was a significant decline in lipid peroxidation index (PI) (Fig. 232 4i). A low PI, indicates that lipids contain fewer carbon-carbon double bonds, making them less 233 susceptible to peroxidation and this has been previously associated with increased lifespan, probably 234 related to lower susceptibility to lipid peroxidation 41,42 ,43 . A reduction in the susceptibility to lipid 235 peroxidation suggests better resistance to oxidative stress 44,45 and worms treated with synergistic drug 236 combinations indeed showed such an increase in resistance (Fig. 5f). We also observed an increase in 237 total sphingomyelin (Fig. 4h); an event that has previously shown to elicit autophagy-dependent 238 lifespan extension in the nematodes 46 . 239 240 Drug synergy improves health span and delays ageing 241 Suppression of energy metabolism and inhibition of the electron transport chain (ETC) can extend 242 lifespan in C. elegans 47,48 .

This means that the RIF+PSORA+ALLAN drug combinations extend 272 lifespan by making worms age more slowly while at the same time making them move 273 faster/increasing spontaneous activity and increasing their resistance to stress when young. the key questions for ageing studies is whether lifespan effects are conserved across species. 278 We therefore tested whether the synergistic lifespan extensions we found in C. elegans are conserved 279 in Drosophila melanogaster. RAP has previously been shown to extend lifespan of fruit flies 54 while 280 MET has been shown to be ineffective 55 . We systematically tested all single drugs and all synergistic 281 combinations in male fruit flies. First, we showed that RAP and ALLAN extend mean lifespan 282 whereas RIF and PSORA extend only the maximum lifespan of flies (Fig. 6 Supplementary Table 283 S2). However, the RAP based combinations RAP+RIF and RAP+RIF+ALLAN showed conserved 284 synergistic lifespan extension in flies(Fig. 6a). The PSORA based combinations; RIF+PSORA and 285 RIF+PSORA+ALLAN did not show further mean lifespan extension(Fig. 6b). However,286RIF+PSORA showed synergistic maximum lifespan extension compared to single drugs(Fig. 6c).287Comparison of the Gompertz parameters of the mortality trajectories (Extended dataFig. 10b)showed 288 that the baseline mortality rate was not significantly different in drug combination treated flies (IMR 289 difference of RAP+RIF+ALLAN = 2.9e -1 , RIF+PSORA+ALLAN = 4.8e -1 , NS) compared to 290 untreated control. However, the rate of increase of mortality with age is significantly lower in drug 291 combination treatments (Gompertz different b of RAP+RIF+ALLAN = 2.20e -4 , P-value < 0.001, 292 Gompertz different b of RIF+PSORA+ALLAN = 1.15e -2 , P-value <0.05) relative to the control.

            "text": ". The connection between IGF/FOXO and 320 TGF is consistent with previous results where daf-7 regulates lifespan via insulin signaling 35 , 321 neuronal TGF links food availability and longevity 58 , and daf-7 regulates metabolism in C. elegans 322 and controls fat accumulation 36 . Several previous studies have demonstrated that lifespan extending 323 mutations in C. elegans result in alterations in lipid metabolism causing an increase in the MUFA and 324 reduction in PUFA levels 59,60 . In agreement with these reports, our drug synergies resulted in an up 325 regulation of sbp-1, a master transcription factor controlling several genes related to lipid metabolism 326 and MUFA synthesis 38-40 (Fig. 4c,e, Extended data Fig. 5). MS-based lipidomics analysis of 327 nematodes exposed to synergistic drug combinations revealed major changes consistent with 328 activation of sbp-1, including accumulation of TAGs and increases in the MUFA:PUFA ratios (both 329 in PC and PE classes). Previously, it has been shown that an increased TAG abundance prolongs 330 lifespan in budding yeast 61 and C. elegans 36,38 . Furthermore, upon closer inspection of the fatty acyl 331 chains bound to the TAG species, we found a significant increase in those that contained medium 332 chained saturated fatty acyls (MCFA) (14:0, 16:0), (Fig. 4f). The findings from lipidomics therefore 333 are consistent with the observed induction of the sbp-1 and its target lipogenic genes (Figure 334 4c).Increased abundance of such medium chained saturated fatty acyls has also been reported to be 335 positively correlated with longevity in C. elegans previously 59 . Similarly, high abundance of MUFAs 336 has been shown to be associated with extended lifespan in nematodes 62 . In humans, high ratios of 337 MUFA:PUFA have also been found in erythrocyte membranes of children of nonagenarians 63,64 . 338 There has been much interest in the potential for MET and possibly RAP to delay age-dependent 339 decline and disease in humans. Given this translational interest, the limited benefit of combining 340 MET with RAP in both C. elegans and mice is somewhat disappointing. However, as our results 341 illustrate, lifespan is determined through complex and interactive biochemical and gene regulatory 342 networks. Intervening simultaneously at multiple points of these networks can result in significant and 343 sometimes surprising benefits 28 . Our proof-of-principle study suggests that beneficial synergistic and 344 additive interactions affecting key longevity pathways are unexpectedly common and evolutionarily 345 conserved. While, to date, ours is the largest systematic transcriptional screen of drug synergy 346 interactions between compounds targeting ageing pathways, it is important to note that this dataset is 347 too small to derive definitive rules by which to detect or predict synergistic interactions based on the 348 transcriptional profiles of single drugs or even drug combinations. Moreover, there is growing interest 349 in repurposing drugs by identifying compounds that may target known or suggested ageing pathway 350 based on the often-extensive data known about such compounds, including their three-dimensional 351 structure bound to biological ligands, their pharmacokinetics, physical properties and known 352 biological targets and effects 65 . Our finding support the feasibility of targeting multiple conserved 353 ageing pathways using existing drugs to slow down biological ageing rate, an approach that, if 354 translatable to humans, would result in dramatic medical and economic benefits 66 Single drugs extend lifespan of wild type C. elegans 359 Wild type N2 worms treated with different doses of a, RAP b, RIF c, MET d, PSORA and e, ALLAN 360 have longer lifespan. f, Mean lifespan of worms treated with the optimal dose of each drug, mean \u00b1 361 SD.

GO terms enriched by synergistic triple drug combinations determined by Cytoscape 70 and summarized by Revigo 71 . Differentially expressed genes (|LFC| >= 1, P value < 0.05) for each conditions were used as an input for GO term analysis. both a, RIF+PSORA+ALLAN, and b, RAP+RIF+ALLAN mainly targets metabolic pathways.

Purple line links identical genes whereas blue line links different gene that grouped into similar GO terms. b, Venn diagram of pathways enriched in synergistic combinations using eat-2 transcriptome as a background. Only TGF-beta was commonly enriched in all synergistic combinations. S7 TGF-beta pathway is significantly enriched in the synergistic drug combinations differentially expressed genes. a, Top five pathways enriched in the down regulated genes of the four synergistic drug combinations. All synergistic combinations consistently enrich TGF\u03b2. b, Pathways enriched in N2 animals treated with synergistic drug combinations relative to untreated eat-2 worms. All synergistic combinations consistently enrich TGF\u03b2. c, fold enrichment of TGF\u03b2 in all single drugs and synergistic combinations. From single drugs, only RIF enriched TGF\u03b2. All the four synergistic combinations resulted in a significant enrichment of TGF\u03b2 compared to RIF. d, protein-protein interaction drawn by STRING 72 showed that TGF\u03b2/daf-7 has an interaction with daf-2 and daf-16 as well as the lipid metabolism regulators daf-9 and daf-12. Thickness of the edge indicates strength of data support for the specific interaction. e, PC's pooled based on their degree of unsaturation, an increase shown in the MUFA containing species normalized to control, 2500 worms per condition (Mean \u00b1 SD) *P<0.01, **P<0.001, ***P<0.000.

In order to test the lifespan effects, 84 which can be highly sensitive to details in experimental conditions and can be variable between 85 different laboratories 19,23 , we first carried out operator-blinded confirmatory lifespan studies using the 86 previously reported optimal dose for each drug. We found that only five compounds extended lifespan87 reproducibly under conditions used in our laboratory (Fig. 1, Extended data Fig. 1, Supplementary 88Table S2). Generally, lifespan extension effects in our hands tended to be smaller compared to 89 previous reports 7,22,24-26(Fig. 1, Extended data Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S2).Gene expression signature of single drug treatmentsTo examine drug modes of action, we carried out transcriptomics analysis and determined 93 differentially expressed genes (DEG) and pathway enrichments relative to untreated controls.",

This means that two out of the three pairs formed by the 127 drugs that are most well-separated in the PCA are synergistic (Fig. 2b, Extended data Fig. 4a,b). Of 128 the remaining eight combinations, four extended lifespan as much as their best component while the 129 other four combinations nullified each other and did not result in lifespan extension and none were 130 toxic (Extended data Fig. 2, Supplementary Table S2). Lifespan extension resulting from the two synergistic pairs, while larger than those of previously 132 published drug effects, were still smaller than the benefits seen with genetic mutations 9 . This raises 133 the question whether the effect size seen with the synergistic pairs represented the maximum 134 achievable by adult-onset drug treatment or if further benefits could be gained by adding additional 135 compounds. Since exhaustive combinatorial search of all thirty possible triple drug combinations was 136 not feasible, we explored selected triple combinations based on the original synergistic pairs and 137 taking into account our analysis of transcriptional changes for the single drugs. We first evaluated the 138 combination of the three drugs best separated by PCA and involved in the two initial synergistic pairs 139 (RAP, RIF and PSORA). However, nematodes treated with this triple combination had a shorter 140 lifespan than seen with either of the dual combinations (Extended data Fig. 3a SupplementaryTable 141S2). We then tested three drug combinations including ALLAN as the third component. As explained 142 above, ALLAN has a gene expression signature that is quite distinct from the rest of our drugs.",
