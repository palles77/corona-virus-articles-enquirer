The cause of KD remains unknown, although an as-yet unidentified infectious agent might be responsible. By determining the causative agent, we can improve diagnosis, therapy and prevention of KD. recently, identification of an antigen-driven igA response that was directed at cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in KD tissues has provided new insights that could unlock the mysteries of KD.",

            "text": "Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute childhood illness that usually affects previously healthy infants and children. The disease is manifested by a high spiking fever and, in classic cases, four of five additional features: rash; red eyes; red lips and mouth; swollen and red hands and feet; and swollen glands in the neck. These symptoms resolve spontaneously within 1-3 weeks, or sooner after treatment with intravenous gammaglobulin and aspirin. However, inflammation of medium-sized arteries throughout the body, particularly of the coronary arteries, can occur during the acute illness and result in coronaryartery aneurysms in 25-30% of untreated patients [1] [2] [3] [4] . In severe cases, KD leads to heart attacks, coronary-artery-aneurysm rupture and/or sudden death 5, 6 . Affected children can require interventions, such as angioplasty or stent placement, coronaryartery-bypass surgery or, rarely, heart transplantation [7] [8] [9] [10] . Because the features of KD resemble those of other febrile childhood illnesses and as there is no specific diagnostic test for KD, diagnosis can be delayed or never established, which results in a higher likelihood that coronary-artery abnormalities will develop 11 . Incomplete clinical presentations of KD, in which children present with fever but fewer than four of the other classic features, make diagnosis especially difficult 12 . Although treatment with intravenous gammaglobulin and aspirin is an effective therapy for KD, its mechanism of action is unknown, not all children respond and the optimal treatment for children with refractory KD remains unclear 2, 13, 14 . Identification of the aetiology of KD would greatly enhance efforts to develop a diagnostic test, improve therapy and prevent KD.",

The young age group that is affected, the winter-spring predominance of cases in non-tropical climates and the existence of epidemics or clusters of cases that spread in a wave-like manner throughout a community also suggest an infectious cause 15 . In the 40 years since Tomisaku Kawasaki initially described the clinical features of KD 16 , many possible aetiological agents have been suggested (TABLe 1) , but none have been confirmed by subsequent study. studies of KD aetiology and pathogenesis are fraught with difficulties. Accessing the most important target tissue of the disease, the coronary artery, for aetiological and pathogenic studies is not possible in living patients. As KD is an illness of small children, there are also ethical constraints on obtaining biopsy samples for research studies from lymph nodes and other tissues. so far, it has not been possible to reproduce the disease in an animal model by injecting blood, body fluids or tissue samples from acutely ill patients.",

These studies revealed that oligoclonal IgA plasma cells infiltrate inflamed tissues, including coronary arteries 17, 18 . synthetic versions of these oligoclonal KD antibodies bind to an antigen in acute-KD-inflamed ciliated bronchial epithelium 21 . light and electron microscopy studies have demonstrated that the antigen is localized to cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in tissues inflamed by acute KD 22 . In this Opinion, we discuss pathological and immunological findings of acute KD, with an emphasis on the IgA immune response and its antigenic targets, and on the importance of macrophages and their secreted factors in the pathogenesis of coronary-artery-aneurysm formation. Although other theories of KD aetiology will be discussed, our primary goal is to highlight a new pathway of discovery in KD research: the identification of IgA plasma cells in tissues inflamed by KD and the subsequent identification of viral-like cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in tissues inflamed by KD. The proposed pathogenesis of KD described below and illustrated in FIG. 1 represents the opinion of the authors, which was formed on the basis of these findings and the well-described pathological features of KD.",

            "text": "History of KD aetiology studies Clinical, epidemiological and pathological studies of KD that were performed in Japan in the 1970s and 1980s quickly led to the hypothesis that an infectious agent is the cause of KD. A ubiquitous agent is suspected because of the rarity of KD in infants under 2 months of age (young infants could be protected by passive maternal antibodies) and in adults (who could have experienced asymptomatic 15, 23, 24 . KD affects all ethnic and racial groups worldwide, but the markedly higher attack rate of KD in children of Asian ethnicity suggests a genetic predisposition to symptomatic infection; an increased attack rate is also observed in Japanese-American children who have a Western diet and lifestyle 25 . By the age of 5, 1 in 150 Japanese children 26 , 1 in 1,000 Black children from the United states 27 and 1 in 2,000 Caucasian children from the United states 27 will have developed KD. siblings of patients with KD and children whose parents have a history of KD are at higher risk than the general population 28, 29 . Genetic susceptibility to KD is probably polygenic -polymorphisms in several genes that are related to an immune response, such as interleukin-4, chemokine receptor 5, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3-like 1 and inositol phosphate kinase C [30] [31] [32] , have been implicated, which is compatible with an aetiology that is probably infectious. Genome-wide linkage analysis has revealed linkage of KD with chromosome 12q24, and multiple candidate genes are located in this chromosomal region 33 . Extensive culture and serological studies have not been successful 25, 34 , and none of the proposed agents have been confirmed [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] (TABLe 1) . It has been suggested that KD is caused by multiple aetiological agents, because various microorganisms have been isolated from individual patients with KD 51, 52 . Although several illnesses that are not associated with fever and primarily involve a one-organ system can be triggered by diverse infectious agents, such as reye syndrome and haemolytic uraemic syndrome, there is no precedent for a multisystem febrile childhood illness with distinctive clinical features, such as KD, to be the result of multiple diverse aetiological agents. some childhood febrile illnesses, such as polio, roseola and fifth disease, were suggested to be the result of multiple agents, but were later found to be due to a single infectious agent or a group of closely related infectious agents. Because KD is a common illness, it is more likely that KD occasionally coexists with other infections, without causal relationships.",

Further study showed that IgA plasma-cell infiltration of the arterial wall was characteristic of acute KD 17 , which prompted examination of non-vascular tissues. IgA plasma cells infiltrate the upper respiratory tract of patients with acute KD, often in a peribronchial distribution 18 . Examination of other tissues inflamed by KD revealed IgA plasma-cell infiltration in the pancreas (during acute KD), especially around the pancreatic ducts and in the kidneys 18 . Absolute numbers of IgA B lymphocytes were decreased in peripheral blood in patients with acute KD compared with controls, which suggests that these cells may selectively enter target tissues of the disease in a manner that is similar to CD8 + T lymphocytes 85 .",

Immunoglobulin heavy-chain \u03b1-genes that had been identified in the arterial wall of three children who had died of acute KD were sequenced in the CDr3 (antigen-binding) region, which revealed that each of the three patients had a restricted pattern of CDr3 usage that was characteristic of an antigen-driven response 19 .

Nucleic acid stains indicate that ICIs contain rNA, but not DNA. Although ICIs were not detected in the ciliated bronchial epithelium of control infants, they were present in the ciliated bronchial epithelium from approximately 25% of the control patients who were 9-84 years old. These older control patients had probably experienced asymptomatic infection with the ubiquitous KD agent; this high prevalence of ICIs in older control patients suggests that the KD agent can cause persistent infection. Taken together, these findings are consistent with a ubiquitous, persistent rNA virus as the aetiological agent of KD 87 . We propose a model of KD pathogenesis in which the aetiological agent of KD enters through the respiratory tract and infects ciliated bronchial epithelium, where it forms ICIs (FIG. 1) . The agent might enter the bloodstream via macrophages, as a result of either infection or uptake by the cells that act as scavengers, before being carried to its target tissues, particularly coronary arteries, other arterial tissue and ductal tissues. Antigen-specific IgA plasma cells and CD8 + T lymphocytes infiltrate the targeted tissues to combat the pathogen and contain the infection, but the coronary arteries might be damaged by the products of activated macrophages and lymphocytes, such as MMPs. Alternatively, the infection could be controlled through gammaglobulin therapy by the provision of specific antibody, perhaps via antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity [88] [89] [90] (the mechanism for the dramatic clinical response of patients with Argentine haemorrhagic fever, an arenavirus infection to immune gammaglobulin).",

Identification of the KD aetiological agent will be accelerated by the placement of biopsy or autopsy tissues from patients with KD into an optimal cutting-temperature compound for storage at -70 o C, into liquid nitrogen for rapid freezing with storage at -70 o C and into glutaraldehyde and formalin. Ultrastructural analysis of ICIs in glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue and molecular studies of unfixed tissues will facilitate rapid progress. The new finding that ICIs are present in 25% of normal control patients might make more tissue available for research. The goal of these studies is to identify the causative agent of KD so that a diagnostic test and better therapies can be developed. Additional research on the genetics of KD could enable the identification of patients who are at high risk of the disease. The long-term goal of KD aetiology and pathogenesis research is to prevent the disease by vaccination or other strategies. Abstract | When the UNiceF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDr) was established in the mid-1970s, it represented an innovative institutional formula in terms of its structure and the manner in which scientists were convened from both developed and developing countries to address some of the world's most neglected parasitic diseases. A review of TDr's historical record sheds light not only on some important milestones in tropical disease research, but also on how future challenges could be approached and hopefully surmounted.",

Although TDr was initially sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Development Programme was also involved from the beginning and joined formally as a co-sponsor in 1976, followed by the World Bank in 1977 and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in 2003. Another innovation was the equal representation of donor and recipient governments on TDr's governing body, the Joint Coordinating Board (JCB), which was created in 1978 (ReF. 5) . Meanwhile, the scientific and Technical Advisory Committee (sTAC), an independent technical-oversight body, enlisted leading scientists not only from global centres of expertise but also from disease-endemic regions and industry. This kind of cooperation bestowed research credibility and helped make TDr a forerunner of the public-private partnerships (PPPs) that would emerge around the turn of the millennium 6-9 .
