It shares antigenic relationships with other coronaviruses, such as porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and canine coronavirus (CCV). The other well-characterized human coronavirus, HCV-OC43, is in a separate antigenic group which includes mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and bovine coronavirus (BCV). Both human coronaviruses are mainly respiratory pathogens and have been estimated to cause up to 25% of common colds (McIntosh et a/., 1974; Wege et a/., 1982) . They have also been implicated in gastrointestinal diseases (Resta et a/., 1985) . Furthermore, the isolation of coronaviruses bearing an antigenic relationship to HCV-OC43 from the central nervous system of two patients with multiple sclerosis has suggested a possible etiologic relationship between human coronaviruses and multiple sclerosis (Burks et a/., 1980) . This possibility is supported by the observation that neurotropic strains of MHV cause demyelination in the central nervous system of rodents (Weiner and Stohlman, 1978) . Thus, human coronaviruses are important human pathogens.",

The virion contains a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA molecule (molecular weight 6-8 X 1 O6 Da) (Lai and Stohlman, 1978) associated in a helical conformation with nucleocapsid proteins (N) . The viral nucleocapsid is enclosed by an envelope, in which are embedded at least two types of viral proteins, the peplomer (E2) and matrix (El) glycoproteins. Coronavirus RNA replication occurs in the cytoplasm of infected cells and is mediated by a virusencoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Brayton et a/., 1982) . The virus-specific mRNA in infected cells comprises a genomic-sized RNA plus six subgenomic mRNA species. These mRNAs are arranged in a nested-set structure, which is characterized by RNAs having common 3'-termini but extending for varying lengths in the 5'direction (Lai et al., 1981) . Only the 5'proximal regions of each mRNA are translated (Rottier et a/., 1981) . A unique feature of the structure of coronavirus is the existence, at the 5'-end of each mRNA, of an identical leader sequence. This sequence is derived from the 5'-end of the genomic RNA and is of approximately 70 nucleotides in length (Lai eta/., 1983 (Lai eta/., , 1984 . Recent evidence has supported a role for the leader sequence in mediating a novel type of discontinuous transcription of genomic RNA (Baric et a/., 1985; Makino et al., 1986; .",

Intracellular RNA was extracted from infected L132 monolayers at specified times p.i. The RNA was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1) . As can be seen, viral mRNA synthesis could be detected as early as 7 hr p.i. and reached maximum at 29 hr p.i. Thereafter, total RNA synthesis gradually declined. By 46 hr p.i. onlythe most abundant mRNA species were evident. The number and size of these mRNA species are comparable to those of MHV mRNAs and are in agreement with previously published results (Weiss and Leibowitz, 1981) . Significantly, mRNA 2a, which was previously found only in BCV-infected cells and proposed to encode hemagglutinins (King et a/., 1985; Keck et a/., 1988) was not present. This is consistent with the finding that HCV-229E does not have hemagglutinating activity (Hierholzer, 1976) . The relative amounts of the mRNA species were the same throughout the replication cycle. Therefore, in all of our subsequent experiments, the virus-specific intracellular RNAs were extracted at 15 hr p.i. Molecular cloning of HCV-229E genomic RNA and intracellular virus-specific mRNAs cDNA cloning was initially performed using virion genomic RNA as a template. The sizes of inserts in the resultant cDNA clones ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 kb in length. One clone, A34, contained a 0.45-kb insert, which was subsequently characterized by restriction mapping and Northern blot analysis. The 0.45kb fragment was labeled with 32P by nick-translation and hybridized with intracellular RNA from 229E-infected cells. The result, shown in Fig. 2 , revealed that the fragment hybridized to each of the mRNA species. This result suggested that the HCV229E subgenomic mRNAs possess a nested-set structure similar to other coronaviruses and that A34 represented a cDNA clone of either the 3'-end of the genomic RNA or the leader sequence.",

Clone Sl 0 was found to have a poly(A) stretch of 34 bases. Figure 4 shows the complete DNA sequence with a translation of the main open reading frame (ORF) in one-letter amino acid code. This ORF extends from base 147 to base 13 13 and predicts a 389 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 43,366 Da. This predicted molecular weight is slightly smaller than the measured molecular weight of the nucleocapsid protein of HCV-229E, which is 50 kDa as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (MacNaughton, 1980) . The difference is probably due to phosphorylation or other modification of the protein. The predicted protein shares features with the nucleocapsid proteins of TGEV, MHV, BCV, HCV-OC43, and IBV (Kapke and Brian, 1986; Skinner and Siddell, 1984; Armstrong er a/., 1983; Lapps et a/., 1987; Kamahora et al., 1988; Boursnell et a/., 1985) . Namely, the protein is highly basic and rich in serine residues. Sixty percent of the amino acid residues are basic and 12% are acidic. There are 39 serine residues (10% of total), which are presumed to be sites of phosphorylation (Stohlman and Lai, 1979) . When compared to TGEV, with which HCV-229E shares antigenic properties, both N proteins have identical amounts of basic and acidic amino acids and serine residues and similar molecular weights (Kapke and Brian, 1986) . Figure 5 shows a schematic diagram of the possible ORFs obtained by translating the nucleotide sequence. The ORF in frame 3 is likely the one which encodes the nucleocapsid protein. In frame 2, the 5'-flanking region probably contains part of the sequence of the matrix protein encoded by gene 6. This possibility is sup- --I1 I II I III   -----__   1   III1  -I   -llil  I  II  II  I I  I  III I II   2-J  I I 111111 II I1111111 lllll  III I II, 1111 I Ill1 IIII I   3  I  I  I  I  Ill  I I I11   I  I  I  I  I ported by the finding that reading frame 2 remains open at the extreme 5'-end. Furthermore, the sequence TCTAAACT, which is found in the intergenic regions of several other coronaviruses (Kapke and Brian, 1986; Skinner and Siddell, 1984; Armstrong et a/., 1983; Lapps et al., 1987; Kamahora et a/., 1988; Budzilowicz eta/., 1985) is also present between the presumed initiation codon of the main ORF and the 3'-end of gene 6. This sequence is the proposed site of fusion of the leader sequence with the mRNA coding region Makino et al., 1986; Budzilowicz eT al., 1985) .",

Since our cDNA clones did not appear to contain leader sequences, we used primer extension studies to determine the sequence of the HCV-229E leader RNA. A synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide which was complementary to an 18-mer sequence located near the 5'-end of the gene (Fig. 4) was end-labeled and used in a primer extension study with poly(A)-selected intracellular mRNA as a template. The reaction products, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, revealed six bands (data not shown). Since these bands were most likely to represent the primerextended products of the individual mRNA species, the smallest and most abundant band, corresponding to the primer-extended product of mRNA7, was eluted and sequenced by the chemical modification method (Maxam and Gilbert, 1977) . The sequence of the 3'-end of the primer-extended product was identical to the L8 sequence from nucleotides 129 to 17 1. At nucleotide 128, immediately 5' to the proposed leader mRNA fusion site, the sequence diverged from the L8 sequence and revealed a putative 60-base leader sequence which is shown in Fig. 6 .

Amino acid sequence analysis revealed several suggests that a certain degree of functional homology structural features common to both viruses, which may exists within the first and last one-third of each molehave functional significance. For instance, there is a cule, with an additional region around position 200. The peak around position 200 occurs just after the serine-rich region of the molecule. The relative conservation of these regions suggests a possible role in the interaction of the N protein with the viral genome. Similar structural features exist among the N proteins of HCV-229E, IBV, MHV, HCV-OC43, and BCV (Skinner and Siddell, 1984; Lapps eT a/., 1987; Kamahora et a/., 1988; Boursnell et a/., 1985) . This is demonstrated by the hydropathy profiles of these proteins, which are also shown in Fig. 7 . Further studies are required to reveal the functional significance of the conserved domains.",
