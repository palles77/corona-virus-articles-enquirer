The transmission process and outbreak pattern of SARS is still not well understood. This study aims to find a simple model to describe the outbreak pattern of SARS cases by using SARS case data commonly released by governments. The outbreak pattern of cumulative SARS cases is expected to be a logistic type because the infection will be slowed down due to the increasing control effort by people and/or due to depletion of susceptible individuals. The increase rate of SARS cases is expected to decrease with the cumulative SARS cases, as described by the traditional logistical model, which is widely used in population dynamic studies. The instantaneous rate of increases were significantly and negatively correlated with the cumulative SARS cases in mainland of China (including Beijing, Hebei, Tianjin, Shanxi, the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia) and Singapore. The basic reproduction number R o in Asia ranged from 2.0 to 5.6 (except for Taiwan, China). The R o of Hebei and Tianjin were much higher than that of Singapore, Hongkong, Beijing, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, indicating SARS virus might have originated differently or new mutations occurred during transmission. We demonstrated that the outbreaks of SARS in many regions of Asia were well described by the logistic model, and the control measures implemented by governments are effective. The maximum instantaneous rate of increase, basic reproductive number, and maximum cumulative SARS cases were also calculated by using the logistic model.",

From rm, R o can be estimated if only the infection period from a single case to the secondary case is given. According to the epidemic studies on SARS in Hong Kong, China and Singapore[I,21, the mean serial interval, defined as the sum of incubation period and the duration of infectiveness of SARS person, is estimated as 8-12 d with an average of 8.4\u00b13.8 din Singapore, and R o is estimated to be from 2.2 to 3.6. Since the incubation period is about 5 or 6.4 d[11, the duration of infectiveness (D 1 ) is about 3 d. Hospitalized SARS persons would also infect front-line doctor staff in hospital, and the average duration of SARS person in hospital (D 2 ) is about 14 d [26] . As shown in Table 1 rate of increase against the cumulative SARS cases in China and in Singapore. This is also a good indication that the control measures, mostly strict isolation of SARS persons and persons with experience of close contact to The maximum cumulative SARS cases in many provinces or cities in the mainland of China were fitted very well byusing eq. (2) based on the peak values of new SARS cases or by using eq. (3) ( Table 2 ). The maximum cumulative SARS cases in Beijing were estimated to be 2398 and 2547 respectively by using the two methods, very close to the observed value 2520; the maximum cumulative SARS cases in whole mainland of China were estimated to be 6212 and 6020 respectively, very close to the observed cases 5328 ( Table 2 ). The prediction accuracy was very high. Therefore, the model could play an important role in prediction of outbreak of SARS accumulative cases. However, prediction using both ways would become difficult if the variation of increase rate is large for a small number of cumulative SARS cases. Our study clearly indicates that the outbreak pattern of the SARS virus in China is of a logistic type, and there is strong negative \"density dependency\" of the instantaneous SARS persons, implemented by government, are effective, and these measures were also causative factors in the negative correlation between rate of increase and total cumulative SARS cases.",
