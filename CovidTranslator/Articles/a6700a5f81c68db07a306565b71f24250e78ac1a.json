Methods: We reviewed the outbreak investigation reports and medical records of 1 index case and 25 additional MERS cases in hospitals A (14 cases) and B (11 cases), and conducted an in-depth interview with the index case. Results: The CFR in hospital B was higher than that in hospital A (63.6% vs. 28.6%, respectively). Higher MERS-CoV exposure conditions were also found in hospital B, including aggravated pneumonia in the index case and nebulizer use in a six-bed admission room. The host factors associated with high CFR were pre-existing pneumonia, smoking history, an incubation period of less than 5 days, leukocytosis, abnormal renal function at diagnosis, and respiratory symptoms such as sputum and dyspnea. Conclusions: The conditions surrounding MERS-CoV exposure and the underlying poor pulmonary function due to a smoking history or pre-existing pneumonia may explain the high CFR in hospital B. The clinical features described above may enable prediction of the prognosis of MERS cases.",

After discharge, due to his experiencing symptoms such as a febrile sense, chilling, cough, general weakness, and diarrhea, the patient was admitted to hospital A during 22-28 May 2015. Since his illness worsened, including development of a severe productive cough, the patient wanted a discharge from hospital A to visit the emergency room (ER) of hospital B via his own transportation on May 28. Chest radiographs showed the progression of pneumonia from May 22 to 28. The chest image in hospital B on May 28 showed aggravation of pneumonia compared with those obtained in hospital A. On the second day of admission in hospital B, he received lidocaine inhalation in his admission room using a jet nebulizer and then underwent a bronchoscopy in a separate examination room. Medical staff in the bronchoscopy room wore surgical masks, gloves, and vinyl gowns.

Hospital factors such as a high prevalence of comorbid conditions among inpatients and the specific hospital environment may increase the CFR. 8 The underlying diseases among inpatients influenced CFR, as the CFR was higher in the acute care pulmonary ward in hospital B compared to the chronic care patients in hospital A. Additionally, certain aspects of the hospital environment may affect the CFR. Compared to hospital A, the higher density of inpatients and lower air ventilation in the room occupied by the index case in hospital B could have increased exposure to MERS-CoV, which may also explain in part the higher CFR in hospital B.",

            "text": "The index case may be another important factor to consider since the patient had aggravated pneumonia and visited hospital B without communication between the two hospitals. This form of \"doctor shopping\" causes inpatients and caregivers to be unexpectedly exposed to high viral loads. The C t values of the index case in hospital B indicated a high viral load status. Additionally, the jet nebulizer used in the admission room of hospital B may have increased virus transmission to surrounding patients, as was observed during the nosocomial outbreak of SARS. 9 Cho et al. 10 showed a difference in incubation period according to the levels of MERS-CoV exposure in a super-spreading event in an ER. Virlogeux et al. reported associations between shorter incubation periods and disease severity in cases of SARS 11 and MERS, 12 respectively. Thus, a higher infecting dose may have led to greater viral replication, a shorter incubation period, more aggressive inflammatory responses, and more severe outcomes. 12 In fact, cases in hospital B had lower mean incubation periods and higher CFRs than those in hospital A. Pre-existing pneumonia was associated with increased CFR in this study. This is consistent with the single-center experience in Saudi Arabia in which concomitant infection was an important risk factor for mortality. 13 Bacterial co-infection is common in any viral pneumonia such as influenza pneumonia, 14 and pneumonia increases pulmonary permeability. 15 We presume that MERS-CoV can infect more readily an injured lung and accelerate progression to systemic infection, which leads to death. For the same reason, smoking history was significantly associated with the CFR of MERS in this study. 16, 17 Male gender was also a significant factor in the present study, possibly due to confounding by smoking and co-morbid conditions: males had a higher frequency of smoking history than females, and 84.6% of male cases (25.0% of female cases) were inpatients.",

Specifically, incubation period, dyspnea and sputum, leukocytosis, and elevated BUN and Cr levels were associated with elevated CFR. As discussed above, the shorter incubation period may be associated with higher viral exposures and more aggressive clinical progression. 12, 18 This suggestion is supported by the association between leukocytosis and CFR. An activated host immune response to viral infection may also increase the CFR, similar to the observed neutrophilic response in SARS cases with poor prognoses. 19, 20 Moreover, since aggravated pulmonary infiltration may induce dyspnea and sputum, these symptoms may be predictive of higher CFR. On the other hand, cases with abnormal renal function had no history of chronic kidney disease in our study. Acute renal impairment during the clinical progression of MERS could predict mortality in patients with MERS-CoV, 21 which was also found in SARS patients. 22 The C t values were not associated with CFR in this study, which agrees with the study of Kim et al. 23 where no association was found between viral load and survival in respiratory specimens from 21 MERS-CoV patients. However, Kim et al. 23 showed that blood viral RNA positivity was related to survival in the early phase of infection.",

First, the number of fatal events (11 fatal cases) was insufficient to provide adequate statistical power in the multiple logistic regression analysis to adjust for age. According to the analysis of the CFR, the ageadjusted odds ratio of smoking or pre-existing pneumonia was not significant. The number of events per independent variable (EPV) usually needs to be at least 10 in a logistic regression model. 24 Moreover, statistical power is generally very low even at 20 EPV. 25 Second, non-fatal cases could have been missed, because serological analyses were not performed to identify such cases. Thus, missing non-fatal cases may have led to lower CFRs than presented. Third, we could not compare the level of environmental contamination with MERS-CoV between the main outbreak wards in the two hospitals because the wards had been cleaned prior to investigation of the outbreak. In summary, the risk factors for mortality of MERS cases in Daejeon were underlying poor pulmonary function such as preexisting pneumonia and smoking history, and exhalation of a large quantity of virus by the index case using a nebulizer in a morecrowded room with inefficient air ventilation in hospital B. Furthermore, the shorter incubation period, leukocytosis, abnormal renal function at diagnosis, and respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea and sputum were predictive of a fatal prognosis. The risk factors and predictors described above may have played an important role in MERS mortality in Daejeon.",

Patients with a peak body temperatures >37.5 C also had elevated CFRs, although this finding was not statistically significant (RR 6.57 [95% CI 0.45-96.05], p = 0.169). Cases with dyspnea or sputum had a higher CFR than those without either (RR 2.29 [95% CI 1.09-4.79], p = 0.029; RR 3.33 [95% CI 1.71-6.51], p < 0.001, respectively) (Table 2). Fourth, in terms of laboratory examinations, when leukocytosis was defined as a WBC level >10,000/mm 3 , four patients had leukocytosis and all died (RR 2.67 [95% CI 1.42-5.02], p = 0.002). However, lymphopenia (lymphocyte < 1,000/mm 3 ) was not associated with increased CFR. Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels were also associated with increased CFR (RR 2.25 [95% CI 1.34-3.77], p = 0.002; RR 2.11",
