Hopefully this will increase the awareness of modeling infectious diseases spreading that is an important topic in mathematical biology [1] . There are different approaches to this topic, e.g. ordinary differential equations, difference equations, partial differential equations and coupled map lattice. Here we use fractional order differential equations (FOD). The reason is that FOD are naturally related to systems with memory which exists in most biological systems. Also they are closely related to fractals which are abundant in biological systems. Consider the following evolution equation [2] :",

            "text": "Now we present a nonlocal interacting epidemic model. The nonlocal interactions in the epidemic spreading is widely observed in many outbreaks, especially the recent ones of FMD, SARS and bird's flu. The Lajmanovich-Yorke model [13, 14] is a special case of coupled map lattices. It is a globally interacting model that emphasizes the diffusion of a disease from other infected farms beside its spread within the same farm. We have generalized it to the inhomogeneous case [15] and introduced it as an approximation for the epidemic spreading on small-world networks [15] . Consider n patches, where each one contains a certain number of individuals (say animals). In general these patches are not identical. Infection spreads from infected animals within the patch and due to those diffusing from other patches. The fractional order form of the model is given by D a y i \u00bc l i y i \u00f01 \u00c0 y i \u00de \u00fe m i \u00f01 \u00c0 y i \u00de X jai y j \u00c0 g i y i ; i \u00bc 1; 2; . . . ; n,where y i is the number of infected individuals in the ith patch. The first term represents the infection within the patch with a rate l i . The second term represents the effect of other patches both nearby and far away at a rate m i . The recovery rate is represented by g i . Since the effect of other patches (second term in Eq. (14)) is significantly smaller than the first one, we expect that m i 5l i . The disease is eradicated if y i \u00bc 0, 8 i \u00bc 1, 2, y, n. So the stability of this solution is studied. Using the same procedures in the previous section, the stability of the zero solution (disease free state) is that all the eigenvalues x of the matrix A satisfy |arg(x)|4ap/2 where A \u00bc:: :: :: :: :::: :: :: :: :: m n m n m n . . . l n \u00c0 g n ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi \u00f0l 1 \u00c0 g 1 \u00fe l 2 \u00c0 g 2 \u00de 2 \u00c0 4\u00bd\u00f0l 1 \u00c0 g 1 \u00de\u00f0l 1 \u00c0 g 1 \u00de \u00c0 m 1 m 2 q l 1 \u00c0 g 1 \u00fe l 2 \u00c0 g 2 0 @ 1 A 4 ap 2 .",
