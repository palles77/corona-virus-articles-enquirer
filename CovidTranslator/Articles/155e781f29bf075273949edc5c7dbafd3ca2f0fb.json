HCoV was detected in 12 samples (229E: 11; HKU1: 1) from seven mother-child couples. For three couples, only MR tested positive (cases 1-3). For two other couples all three samples (MV, MR and NG) tested positive (cases 4 and 5). For case 6, only MV and NG tested positive. In case 7, only MV was positive. Possible vertical transmission of HCoV was hypothesized in this pilot study and requires further investigation on a larger scale.",

Each assay was initially assessed using positive controls. An ABI prism 7000 TaqMan (PE, Foster City, CA, USA) was used to amplify and quantify the amplification product after each cycle. Triplex RT-PCR was initially carried out to test for HcoV-229E, NL63, and OC43; a second real-time RT-PCR was subsequently performed with a set of primers/probe, detecting both HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 as described by Kuypers et al. [13] . In each technique, 5-7 \u00b5l of RNA extract were added to a 25-\u00b5l one-step reverse-transcription PCR using Superscript\u2122 III Platinum\u00ae One-Step qRT-PCR SuperMix plus ROX (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France).

Genital tropism of HCoV was thus found, with four vaginal swabs that were effectively positive, in association with a positive respiratory swab 50% of the time. Vaginal carriage of HCoV appears to be a significant element of transmission, as the 3 infants with a gastric swab positive for HCoV all had mothers with positive vaginal samples. One newborn among the 3 was delivered by cesarean: case 6 (MR-, MV+, NG+). Genital passage thus does not appear indispensable to transmission, leading to the hypotheses of ascending intrauterine transmission or transplacental viremia. However, no viremia has been reported in human coronavirus respiratory infection aside from SARS-CoV. Moreover, transmission to the infant is not consistent, as among the 7 mothers carrying the virus, more than half had infants whose gastric samples were negative.",

On the other hand, vertical transmission was shown in enteroviruses responsible for sometimes severe neonatal infections [17] . If no materno-fetal transmission has been observed in humans, this mode of contamination is well-known among veterinary services. Numerous coronaviral strains have been isolated in different animals, each virus being named as a function of its host and possible associated pathology: avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), bovine coronavirus (BCV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV), and rat coronavirus (RCV), among others [11] . These coronaviruses are responsible for sporadic infections and seasonal outbreaks among breeders. Adult animals present limited or unapparent infection and transmit the virus to newborns, which then show a far more severe pathology. The majority of coronaviral strains are excreted in respiratory secretions and feces, sources of post-natal transmission. However, certain strains can replicate in the macrophages, lymphocytes, hepatocytes, neurons, endothelial cells or in the urogenital tract, which can result in materno-fetal infections [11] . Experimental infections with the mouse hepatitis virus resulted in fetal death or neonatal infection [18] . Transmission of MHV in utero following oronasal or intravenous inoculation of gestating mice was found by Barthold et al. However, this vertical transmission of MHV occurred in different percentages depending upon MHV strain and host genotype. This could explain our detection of only two HCoV-229E infections in newborns. The rat coronavirus (RCV) infects the respiratory epithelium and the lachrymal glands, but also the genital tract of females, causing perturbations of the hormonal cycle, miscarriage, and neonatal mortality. The IBV strain infects the oviduct in chickens and perturbs egg production [2] .",
