In this study, we compared the immunogenicity and protection efficacy of recombinant proteins corresponding to different domains of the SARS-coronavirus spike protein. Trimeric recombinant proteins were created by fusing the foldon domain derived from T4 bacteriophage to the carboxy-termini of individual domains of the spike protein. While the full-length ectodomain (S) of the spike protein, the full-length ectodomain fused to foldon (S-foldon), the S1 domain (S1), S1-foldon, and the S2 domain(S2) antigens all elicited comparable antibody titers as measured by ELISA, S-foldon induced a significantly higher titer of neutralizing antibody and S2 protein did not elicit virus neutralizing antibodies. When tested in a mouse virus replication model, all the mice vaccinated with the S1, S1-foldon, S, or S-foldon were completely protected.",

            "text": "The genome of SARS-CoV encodes four structural proteins, including spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N), and some nonstructural proteins (3, 4) . The S protein is a 150-180 kDa transmembrane protein and is responsible for receptor binding via its receptor-binding domain located in the S1 region, as well as virus-membrane fusion and tissue tropism involving its S2 region (5) . The S protein is the main component of the virus that induces neutralizing antibodies against the virus and is thus con-sidered a main target for SARS vaccines (6) . In the present study, we compared the full-length ectodomain of S protein and its fragments (S1 and S2 domains) with respect to immunogenicity and protection against viral infection in mice. In its native state, S protein is a trimer; however, when its ectodomain is expressed as a recombinant protein in eukaryotic systems, the protein exists predominantly in a monomeric form (7) . To make trimeric recombinant spike proteins, we exploited a 27-amino acid sequence, called the foldon domain, which was identified in the bacteriophage T4 fibritin protein (8) . We compared the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of monomeric full-length spike ectodomain (S) and monomeric S1 domain with trimerized forms of S and S1 generated by fusion of the foldon domain to the carboxy termini of the proteins. Our results showed that recombinant S2 does not elicit neutralizing antibodies and that the full-length ectodomain with a C-terminal foldon (S-foldon) induced higher levels of neutralizing antibodies than S, S1, or S1-foldon constructs. Nevertheless, S, S-foldon, S1, and S1-foldon all protected mice from viral challenge.",

The position of the S-foldon in the gradient relative to the 660 kD protein marker suggests a trimeric state. Of note, however, a small proportion of S molecules sedimented to where the trimeric S-foldon was located, suggesting that S may also form trimers, although at a much lower efficiency compared to S-foldon. In addition, both S and S-foldon were also found in the bottom fractions, indicating that a fraction of S and S-foldon molecules formed aggregates.

Recombinant trimeric full-length S proteins have been reported to be highly immunogenic and able to elicit an efficacious protective immune response (12, 13) . However, full-length S proteins contain a transmembrane domain, making it impractical in vaccine production. To overcome this problem, we made secreted recombinant proteins by fusing a foldon domain derived from phage T4 fibritin to the ectodomain of S or its domains (S1 and S2). The foldon has been shown to promote trimerization of a number of recombinant proteins such as collagen fibers (14) . In our study, both of the recombinant proteins with the foldon (S1foldon and S-foldon) formed trimers or oligomers. As S1 is predicted not to be directly involved in the formation of a trimeric spike protein, it is likely that the trimeric state of the S1-foldon as seen in the present study was a structure in which three monomers were simply bound together by the foldon. Although S-foldon, similarly to S, tends to form aggregates after freezing-thawing, a major fraction of S-foldon appeared to retain a trimeric state. It is unknown from the present study to what extent the trimeric S-foldon is structurally similar to the native spike protein, however. Nevertheless, while S1-foldon was comparable with S1 in immunogenicity and in the potency of inducing virus ",

Indeed, S-foldon was the most potent immunogen among all the five recombinant proteins tested in this study. The principle behind this phenomenon is yet to be elucidated. It is probable that the foldon plays a role in maintaining the native conformation of neutralizing epitopes in the trimeric immunogen. Alternatively, the trimeric protein is more efficiently presented to committed B and T lymphocytes to induce higher levels of antibodies. A number of different animal models have been described for SARS-CoV but none of them completely recapitulate SARS-CoV pathology in humans (15) . Considering cost, availability and ease of use, the virus replication murine model still represents a convenient model for initial proof-ofconcept in the evaluation of vaccine candidates. When tested in the virus infection mouse model, the four immunogens, (S1, S1-foldon, S, and S-foldon) fully protected the mice from virus challenge. No difference was observed between the four immunogens tested, perhaps because the mice had been given four doses and they all had very high antibody levels before the challenge. However, given its much stronger potency in inducing neutralizing antibodies than the other constructs, S-foldon might confer an acceptable level of protection with fewer doses than the other constructs. This would be relevant for use in humans and deserves further study.",

However, reports regarding the presence of neutralizing epitopes in S2 and a protective role for antibodies to S2 have been inconsistent. Several studies have suggested that S2 domain contains neutralizing epitopes. Immunization with Escherichia coli expressed or chemically synthesized S2 peptides elicited neutralizing antibodies (16) (17) (18) . Immunization with plasmids encoding the S2 domain was also reported to induce neutralizing antibodies in rabbits (19) . On the contrary, there are also reports that showed that recombinant S2 domain could not induce neutralizing antibodies (20, 21) . Our results demonstrated that recombinant S2 was highly immunogenic but could not induce neutralizing antibodies. The S2 domain of other coronaviruses also failed to induce neutralizing antibodies (22) (23) (24) (25) . Taken together, it is likely that the protective epitopes on S2, if such exist, are not immunodominant.",
