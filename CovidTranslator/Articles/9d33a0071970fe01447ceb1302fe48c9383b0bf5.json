            "text": "We have analyzed the incidence and risk factors for the occurrence of invasive aspergillosis (IA) among 219 consecutive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic SCT after a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen (Allo-RIC). Twenty-seven patients developed an IA at a median of 218 days (range 24-2051) post-Allo-RIC, for a 4-year incidence of 13% (95% confidence interval 4-24%). In multivariate analysis, risk factors for developing IA were steroid therapy for moderate-to-severe graft vs host disease (GVHD) (Hazard Ratio (HR) 2.9, P \u00bc 0.03), occurrence of a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) by a respiratory virus (RV) (HR 4.3, Po0.01) and CMV disease (HR 2.8, P \u00bc 0.03). Variables that decreased survival after Allo-RIC were advanced disease phase (HR 1.9, P \u00bc 0.02), steroid therapy for moderate-to-severe GVHD (HR 2.2, Po0.01), not developing chronic GVHD (HR 4.3, Po0.01), occurrence of LRTI by an RV (HR 3.4, Po0.01) and CMV disease (HR 2, P \u00bc 0.01), whereas occurrence of IA had no effect on survival (P \u00bc 0.5). Our results show that IA is a common infectious complication after an Allo-RIC, which occurs late post-transplant and may not have a strong effect on survival. An important observation is the possible role of LRTI by conventional RVs as risk factors for IA.",

[2] [3] [4] With regard to invasive aspergillosis (IA), which is by far the most common IFI at our institution and in many others, RIC regimens may have changed their epidemiology, but there are few studies on the description and risk factor analysis of IA in large patient cohorts with a long follow-up. Here, we report our findings regarding the incidence and risk factors for the development of IA among 219 adult patients who underwent an Allo-HSCT with an RIC (Allo-RIC) at the Hospital de La Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Catalonia (ES), between 1999 and 2007, and were prospectively monitored for the occurrence of IA. During this time period, symptomatic patients were also monitored for respiratory virus infections, allowing the analysis of any possible association of these with the occurrence of IA.",

Both included fludarabine plus either oral BU 8-10 mg/kg (with pharmakokinetic drug-dose adjustment 8 ) or IV melphalan 70-140 mg/m 2 (for myeloid and lymphoid malignancies, respectively). 5 Alemtuzumab or antithymocyte globulin was given to recipients of HLA-mismatched related donors or volunteer unrelated donors (VUDs). Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of CsA plus shortcourse MTX or CsA plus mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), as described elsewhere. [6] [7] [8] [9] Antifungal prophylaxis While hospitalized, patients at high risk for IA were kept in areas with a positive-pressure, high-efficiency particulate air-filtered isolation. Anti-Aspergillus antifungal prophylaxis was not routinely used, but patients with mucositis and risk of invasive candidiasis received fluconazole prophylaxis (200 mg/day). Thus, patients did not receive a prophylactic antifungal with activity against molds in the early, preengraftment period. After engraftment, if GVHD occurred that required high-dose steroids, patients again received antifungal prophylaxis, which consisted of fluconazole or itraconazole depending on the patient's tolerance and potential drug interactions. Patients who required hospitalization because of severe steroid-refractory GVHD received prophylactic therapy with a lipid formulation of amphotericin B at a dose of 1 mg/kg/ daily. 10 Monitoring for aspergillosis and respiratory viral infections Aspergillosis. The initial diagnostic work-up of febrile neutropenic patients and the use of empirical antibacterial treatment followed international guidelines. 11 Follow-up included daily clinical examination and microbiological or radiological examinations as clinically indicated. Empirical antifungal therapy with anti-mold active agents was started in patients with persistent or recurrent fever of unknown origin (472 h) and a thoracic computerized tomography (CT) scan was carried out, as reported earlier. 12 Patients with GVHD and a febrile illness or respiratory symptoms not resolving with antibiotics were also routinely studied with a chest CT since 1995, and the routine study of the galactomannan (GM) Platelia assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Marres la Coquette, France) in blood samples since 2003, with a maximum of three times per week in inpatients and at each visit in outpatients. Respiratory samples were also always studied by fungal-directed cytological stains and fungal cultures. Any of these patients who developed a pulmonary infection of possible filamentous (mold) fungal origin is maintained in a prospective registry that is continuously updated by the senior author (RM).",

Since 1998, all inpatient or outpatient adults with a hematologic malignancy (including HSCT recipients) who had signs and symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or lower RTI (LRTI) underwent a detailed virological evaluation. Patients with symptoms of a URTI underwent nasopharyngeal aspiration (NPA), whereas patients with a LRTI underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) when it was clinically possible. 13 Patients with pneumonia but no signs of URTI did not undergo NPA. All clinical samples were tested for viral Ag by indirect immunofluorescence assays for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenzae viruses 1-3 (PIV\u00c01, \u00c02 or \u00c03), influenza A or B (FluA or FluB) and adenoviruses (ADV). Samples were always cultured for these viruses (plus enterovirus) and tested by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for non-polio enterovirus, as described elsewhere. 14 In addition, aliquots from BAL and NPA samples were stored at \u00c070 1C and tested retrospectively for metapneumoviruses and coronaviruses, as described in detail elsewhere. 15 Definitions Definition of IA. Proven and probable IA was defined by the 2002 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group consensus Respiratory viruses and aspergillosis after allogeneic HSCT R Martino et al guidelines. 16 In brief, probable IA was defined by 2 or more positive results of serum galactomannan (optical in-dex40.5) or positive galactomannan in BAL fluid, or the isolation of Aspergillus sp. from a non-sterile site (BAL, one sample; sputum, two samples) or histologically-defined hyalohyphomycosis without a confirmatory culture, associated to suggestive clinical and radiological signs. Suggestive radiological findings included the presence of nodules with the halo sign during neutropenia or cavitated nodules after neutrophil recovery on the chest X-ray or CT scan. 12 Respiratory virus (RV) infections. A URTI was defined as the new onset of nasal, pharyngeal or laryngeal irritation with isolation of an RV in an NPA. LRTI was defined as the new onset of cough, rales and/or wheezing in conjunction with a new pulmonary infiltrate in case of pneumonia identified on a chest radiograph or chest CT scan, with isolation of an RV in a BAL or lung sample.",

Univariate analyses of the risk factors for developing IA were carried out using univariate Cox regression analysis, whereas the log-rank test was used for OS. In addition, to further characterize the truly relevant risk factors, multivariate testing was carried out by multivariate Cox regression analysis, including variables with a Po0.1 in univariate testing. The variables analyzed for their effect on the development of IA (and OS) are shown in Table 2 Posttransplant variables, such as the use of steroids for moderate-to-severe GVHD (defined as acute GVHD grades II-IV and/or extensive chronic GVHD), CMV infection, CMV disease, presence of monocytopenia (o0.1 \u00c2 10 9 /l) and occurrence of a URTI or an LRTI by an RV were included as time-dependent covariates.

We analyzed the 4-month survival according to the presence of five poor risk factors for survival recently published for allogeneic HSCT recipients with IA (monocytopenia (o0.1 \u00c2 10 9 /l), disseminated aspergillosis, renal failure (creatinine41.5 times the upper limit of normal, or ULN), elevated bilirubin (42 times the ULN), respiratory failure (required supplemental oxygen to maintain a pO2460 mmHg) and progression or advanced status of the underlying malignancy).

            "text": "This study represents one of the largest epidemiological studies on the occurrence of invasive mycoses after Allo-RIC. As only cases of IA occurred, without a single case of non-Aspergillus molds or invasive yeast infections, the study focuses on IA. In addition, the long follow-up and detailed prospective observation of all cases lends credibility to its results. The first surprise is the lack of IA in the early post-transplant period, a period during which the first group of neutropenia-related IA has been traditionally observed. [20] [21] Possibly, the short duration of neutropenia and the low non-hematological toxicity are responsible for this early protection from IA, even without the use of the anti-Aspergillus drug prophylaxis. However, during longer follow-up, the risk of developing an IA was still substantial and very similar to the 15% incidence of IA traditionally observed after an Allo-HSCT with conventional myeloablative conditioning. 3, 4, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] In a review published in 2002, the median time to onset of IA after a total of nearly 7400 Allo-HSCT procedures was 90 days (range 19-115 days), 26 again emphasizing the late onset of the cases of IA in this study. When comparing the incidence of IA between studies, it is important to remember that in many studies the Kaplan-Meier P estimate method is used for analyzing the P of a post-transplant event (with at least one clear competing event). However, the recommended method is the cumulative incidence estimate, taking into account major competing events (in this case, relapse of the underlying disease is a competing event for the occurrence of an IA), as used in this study. 18, 19 Nearly always, the incidence of a post-transplant event, such as the occurrence of an IA, will be significantly lower than the probability of that same event calculated by the typical Kaplan-Meier method. Established risk factors for IA among Allo-HSCT recipients include duration of neutropenia before engraftment (for the early post-transplant period or in case of late graft failure), use and duration of glucocorticosteroids, donor type, underlying disease, age of transplant recipient, and presence and treatment of GVHD. 3, 4, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] This study is interesting because of several observations. As we closely monitored the occurrence of RV infections in all symptomatic patients, we were able to analyze their possible effect on the occurrence of IA. It has been known for a long time that apparently immunocompetent (or at least not severely immunocompromised) patients can develop an IA immediately after or during an RV lower respiratory tract infection. This association has been described mostly after influenza infections. 20, 22, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] In addition, recent studies from two independent Allo-HSCT groups have reported that infection by an RV (influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus or other RVs) was an independent risk factor for developing IA in large retrospective analyses. 20, 22, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] This study reinforces the role that RV infections may have in the development of IA after an Allo-HSCT. In addition, we found that only LRTIs increased the risk of developing an IA, whereas isolated URTIs had no effect. This association may reflect a direct implication of the alteration in the bronchial mucosa or pulmonary defensive mechanisms by the RV infection. 33, 34 However, it could also simply reflect how the mechanisms or risk factors by which progression of an URTI to an LRTI by an RV occurs also predispose to the development of an IA.",

These findings have important practical implications, as they highlight that in Allo-RIC recipients, strategies of anti-Aspergillus prophylaxis should be focused on patients who require steroids and/or develop clinically significant GVHD rather than on the neutropenic phase of the procedure in which IFIs are currently very infrequent. Another relevant consequence from our observations is that RIC regimens for allografting may carry a significant risk of developing late onset IA, and the use of prophylaxis may also be justified after CMV disease or after an LRTI by an RV. In addition, such prophylaxis should also be targeted to patients with other possible recently described risk factors for IA, such as those with hyperferritenemia/ iron overload 22 or those with donor/recipient genetic polymorphisms, which may predispose to this opportunistic infection. 35 On the other hand, since the introduction of fluconazole prophylaxis, the risk of developing a severe invasive candidiasis post-transplant has decreased, and the current incidence and mortality because of yeast infections is well below 5% in most Allo-HSCT studies. 26 This has been confirmed in this study.",

            "text": "It is unclear whether the high 4-month mortality after an IA is essentially attributable to the IA or may be a consequence of other underlying high-risk factors, which in turn increase the risk of developing such infections. It is thus interesting that in our multivariate survival analysis, we found that IA was not an independent risk factor for dying after Allo-RIC. However, owing to the limited ability of identifying all the truly independent risk factors for survival in such a complex clinical situation, we believe that this observation should be interpreted with caution, as most studies have shown that patients who develop an IA have a very poor 4-12 month survival. 1,3 However, recent results from the Seattle group showed that survival after an IA was improved in patients who had received a RIC regimen with respect to those who received a conventional myeloablative conditioning. 1, 4 In addition, severe opportunistic infections are well known to coexist and possibly be involved in mortality in many such patients. Thus, it is probable that CMV disease and LRTI by an RV coexisted with IA at the time of death, making it difficult to interpret what the main cause of death is. On the other hand, the finding that LRTI by an RV did have a strong effect on OS lends support to the continued efforts to analyze the epidemiology and clinical effect of these infections in Allo-HSCT recipients, including virological studies in the routine post-transplant work-up of patients with URTIs and LRTIs. 34 In conclusion, IA is an important cause of infectious morbidity after an Allo-RIC, although it occurs late posttransplant and may not have a strong effect on survival. An important observation is the possible role of LRTI by conventional RVs as risk factors for IA.",
