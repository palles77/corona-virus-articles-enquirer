However, over the past decade, the organization has to some extent been bypassed for funding, and it lost some of its authority and its ability to set a global health agenda. The reasons for this decline are complex and multifaceted. Some of the main factors include WHO's inability to reform its core structure, the growing influence of non-governmental actors, a lack of coherence in the positions, priorities and funding decisions between the health ministries and the ministries overseeing development assistance in several donor member states, and the lack of strong leadership of the organization.",

            "text": "ODA and non-governmental funding for health increased by 49% from 1990 to 1997, from US$5.74 billion to US$8.54 billion. Most of this increase came in bilateral funding and in a significant increase in spending on health by the World Bank. This rate of growth pales in comparison with the funding during the following years. From 1998 to 2010, ODA and non-governmental funding for health grew 230%, to US$28.2 billion. 1 Similarly, the period from 1990 to 1997 saw only a handful of new initiatives focused on global health. The period from 1998 to 2010, however, saw the birth of several dozen partnerships, initiatives, foundations and institutions dedicated to financing, coordinating or implementing global health programmes, or achieve global health goals. 2 The 1990s was dominated by the rapid spread and acceleration of the HIV/AIDS pandemic from 8.9 million people living with HIV in 1990 to 23.1 million in 1997. AIDS deaths grew at a similarly rapid pace, from 380,000 in 1990 to 1.2 million seven years later. 3 TB incidence grew slightly globally, but an alarming growth in TB-HIV co-infection gave cause for concern and the rates of detection and completed treatment were worryingly low. Figures for malaria e although uncertain e indicated an increase in drug resistance, a growth in deaths and a breakdown of control-efforts in many countries. 4 Immunization rates of children stagnated at just over 70% coverage during these years 5 and efforts to introduce additional vaccines to the routine immunizations largely failed. 6 There was also substantial concern during this period about the reduction in research and development for new drugs and diagnostics for tropical diseases. 7 These outcomes contrast with the positive results produced especially from 2004 onwards. Over the past ten years a reduction in new HIV infections and in AIDS mortality, a sharp decline in TB deaths, a significant reduction in malaria deaths, a steady increase in routine immunization coverage and the introduction of several additional vaccines as well as the arrival and widespread uptake of some important new drugs, vaccines and diagnostics for several diseases have been seen.",

Dr Jonathan Mann, who had built up the General Program on AIDS within WHO from a one-man operation when it started in 1986 to a $100 million program, resigned in 1990, citing 'major disagreements' with Nakajima. 8 The creation of a UNAIDS Secretariat independently of WHO in 1996 contributed to a sense that WHO was not equipped to lead the fight against such a 'modern' disease with its need for a complex, multifaceted response to issues like discrimination, judicial reform, behavioural change, and prevention strategies that challenged cultural and religious norms. 9 Nakajima's focus was instead on using WHO for tasks that had brought successes for Mahler. He hoped that WHO could repeat the achievement from the smallpox eradication of the 1970s by creating a global campaign to eradicate polio. Alarmed by the steep rise in TB cases, WHO from 1995 onwards also promoted the adoption of the directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS), and in doing so, initiated a wide-ranging reform of most countries' TB treatment. While ultimately successful, these efforts only bore significant fruits in the following decade, giving Nakajima little credit during his time in office.",

Nakajima's main mistake may have been to fail to address these weaknesses head-on. 10, 11 In late 1994, a series of articles in the British Medical Journal, 12 listed the main weaknesses in WHO's existing structure and work, only putting into focus what had already been highlighted in several donor country and UN reports: 13 which led to internal competition for resources within WHO and weakened the organization's less tangible or outcome oriented work, such as its normative-, researchor monitoring activities; 4. its inherent handicaps in addressing the increasingly complex social, economic and political determinants of health; and 5. its inability to find constructive working arrangements with the increasing number of other institutions having a growing influence on global health policy or outcomes.",

She therefore made WHO into a convener for partnerships and initiatives to harness the growing political support for action in global health. 17 The first of these partnerships was Roll Back Malaria, which was initiated soon after she took office. Subsequently, Brundtland worked to create or support new initiatives where she felt there were gaps in the existing health architecture (Medicines for Malaria Venture, GAVI, the Global TB Drug Facility, the Global Fund), to bring parties together for dialogue where she felt there were obstacles (pharmaceutical industry round-tables) and to organize partnerships and alliances where she felt the many actors in a field needed direction and coordination (Tobacco-Free Initiative, Partnerships for Health Sector Development, Global Alliance To Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis, Make Pregnancy Safer, Stop TB Partnership, etc.).",

Indeed, Brundtland was forging ahead with what promised to be a strong global policy on nutrition, but after her departure, the final policy fell victim to industry pressure and was weakened to a point where it has become only a shadow of the strong instrument Brundtland envisaged to help countries' efforts to control obesity, high blood pressure and other nutrition-related health issues.",

However, a renewed version of the International Health Regulations was crafted after the scare provided by the SARS outbreak in 2003 and was approved in 2005. Some significant initiatives have been undertaken over the past decade to somehow address important challenges in global health. The most noteworthy of these may be the Commission on Social Determinants of Health, the Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel and the work leading up to a UN General Assembly Special Session on non-communicable diseases in 2011. Most recently, WHO has promoted a goal of 'Universal Health Coverage' and has lobbied hard to make this the primary health goal of what will eventually become a 'Post 2015 Agenda' to replace the soon expired Millennium Development Goals.",
