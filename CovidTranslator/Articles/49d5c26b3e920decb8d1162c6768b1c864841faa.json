From the nares, the skin, groin, axillae, and perineal region may become colonized [76] . Staphylococci appear in grape-like clusters when viewed by gram stain. They possess a typical gram-positive cell wall consisting of a thick layer of peptidoglycan, and they are nonflatulate, nonmotile, and nonspore forming. The organism grows best aerobically and is classified as a facultative anaerobe. Although 12 species of staphylococci colonize humans, the three of significant medical importance are S aureus, S epidermidis, and S saprophyticus.",

It is the second most common cause of infection in this setting, has the highest mortality rate for any nursing-home-acquired infection, and frequently results in the transfer of cases to the hospital for management. The overall incidence of nursing-home-acquired pneumonia varies from 0.3 to 2.5 episodes per 1000 days of resident care [84, 85] . In a study by Muder [84] , the most common etiologic agent in cases of nursing-home-acquired pneumonia were S pneumoniae, followed by H influenzae (nontypeable) and M catarrhalis. The risk for invasive pneumococcal disease was fourfold higher for patients with nursing-home-acquired pneumonia compared with patients with CAP [86] . With increasing age, the rate of oropharyngeal colonization by gram-negative rods increases. The incidence of aspiration also is higher in the nursing-home setting than in the community. It seems reasonable to assume that gram-negative rods would be important pathogens in nursing-home-acquired pneumonia; however, a significant drawback to the study of such pneumonias is the fact that there is too much reliance on sputum cultures to establish the diagnosis. More carefully done studies are needed to define the cause and epidemiology of pneumonia in the elderly and in the nursing-home setting.",
