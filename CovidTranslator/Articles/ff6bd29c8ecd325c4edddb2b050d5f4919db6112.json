Here we describe the 18 use of HiSeq deep sequencing to analyze host gene expression in primary human alveolar 19 epithelial type II cells infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus. At 24 hours 20 post-infection, 623 host genes were significantly up-regulated, including the cell adhesion 21 molecule CEACAM1. The up-regulation of CEACAM1 was blocked in the presence of the 22 reactive oxygen species inhibitor, apocynin. H5N1 virus infection stimulated significantly higher 23 CEACAM1 protein expression when compared to low pathogenic PR8 H1N1 virus, suggesting a 24 key role for CEACAM1 in influenza virus pathogenicity. Furthermore, silencing of endogenous 25 CEACAM1 resulted in reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine production, as 26 well as reduced levels of virus replication following H5N1 infection. Our study provides 27 evidence for the involvement of CEACAM1 in a clinically relevant model of H5N1 infection and 28 may assist in the development of host-oriented antiviral strategies. 29 30 IMPORTANCE 31",

In addition to constant seasonal outbreaks, highly pathogenic avian influenza 45 (HPAI) strains, such as H5N1, remain an ongoing pandemic threat with recent WHO figures showing 46 454 confirmed laboratory infections and a mortality rate of 53%. It is important to note that humans 47 have very little pre-existing immunity towards avian influenza virus strains. Moreover, there is no 48 commercially available human H5N1 vaccine. Given the potential for H5N1 viruses to trigger a 49 pandemic (1, 2), there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic interventions to combat known 50 deficiencies in our ability to control outbreaks. Current seasonal influenza virus prophylactic and 51 therapeutic strategies involve the use of vaccination and antivirals. Vaccine efficacy is highly variable 52 as evidenced by a particularly severe 2017/18 epidemic and frequent re-formulation of the vaccine is 53 required to combat ongoing mutations in the influenza virus genome. In addition, antiviral resistance 54 has been reported for many circulating strains, including the avian influenza H7N9 virus that emerged 55 in 2013 (3, 4) . Influenza A viruses have also been shown to target and hijack multiple host cellular 56 pathways to promote survival and replication (5, 6). As such, there is increasing evidence to suggest 57 that targeting host pathways will influence virus replication, inflammation, immunity and pathology (6, 58 7). Alternative intervention strategies based on modulation of the host response could be used to 59 supplement the current prophylactic and therapeutic protocols. 60",

Reduction of STING gene expression or other anti-viral factors (e.g. 303 IFNB1, MX1, ISG15; Table S1 ) by apocynin, may in part, explain the slight increase of the 304 transcription levels of all influenza genes (NS gene was significantly upregulated) following apocynin 305 treatment (Fig. 2G) . These results also suggest that apocynin treatment may reduce H5N1-induced 306 inflammation and apoptosis. Indeed, the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of apocynin have 307 been shown previously in a number of disease models, including diabetes mellitus (40) could suggest the possibility that upregulation of CEACAM1 (to inhibit NK activity) may be a novel 324 and uncharacterized immune evasion strategy employed by influenza viruses.

In 263 addition, the TNF-\u03b1 expression, which can be induced type I IFNs (31), was also not affected in 264 siCEACAM1-transfected ATII cells (Fig. 5A). Hypercytokinemia or \"cytokine storm\" in H5N1 and 265 H7N9 virus-infected patients is thought to contribute to inflammatory tissue damage (32, 33).

Neutrophils exert their cytotoxic 312 function by first attaching to influenza-infected epithelial cells via adhesion molecules, such as 313 CEACAM1 (44). Moreover, studies have indicated that influenza virus infection promotes neutrophil 314 apoptosis (45), delaying virus elimination (46). Phosphorylation of CEACAM1 ITIM motifs and 315 activation of caspase-3 is critical for mediating anti-apoptotic events and for promoting survival of 316 neutrophils (27). This suggests that CEACAM1-mediated anti-apoptotic events may be important for 317 the resolution of influenza virus infection. 318 NK cells play a critical role in innate defense against influenza virus by recognizing and killing 319 infected cells. Influenza viruses, however, employ several strategies to escape NK effector functions, 320 including modification of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) glycosylation to avoid NK activating receptor 321 binding (47). Homo-or heterophilic CEACAM1 interactions have been shown to inhibit NK-killing 322 (25, 26), and are thought to contribute to tumor cell immune evasion (48). Given these findings, one 323",

CEACAM1 interacts homophilically with 91 itself (22) or heterophilically with CEACAM5 (a related CEACAM family member) (23). The dimeric 92 state allows recruitment of signaling molecules such as SRC-family kinases, including the tyrosine 93 SHP2 members to phosphorylate ITIMs (24). As such, the presence or absence of ITIMs in CEACAM1 95 isoforms influences signaling properties and downstream cellular function. CEACAM1 homophilic or 96 heterophilic interactions and ITIM phosphorylation are critical for many biological processes, including 97 regulation of lymphocyte function, immunosurveillance, cell growth and differentiation (25, 26) and 98 neutrophil activation and adhesion to target cells during inflammatory responses (27).
