In addition, changes in glycosylation patterns often affect the function of a glycoprotein and are biomarkers for pathological or physiological events. For example, the glycosylation patterns of prostate specific antigen (PSA) from cancer cells in culture20 and prostate cancer patients' tissue and sera21 -23 are different from that of normal prostate; human pancreatic RNase 1, a glycoprotein secreted mostly by pancreatic cells, has completely different oligosaccharide chains when produced from pancreatic tumor cells;24 -27 and deviation from the normal glycosylation pattern on fibrinogen (Fn), a protein critical to blood coagulation, can lead to coagulation disorders. 28 In addition, two recent reviews also discuss stem cell surface glycan biomarkers and show that intricate glycan-dependent modulation of signalling molecules such as FGF-2, Wnt, and Notch plays an important role in stem cell proliferation and differentiation.9 , 29 -32 Table 1 summarizes some additional examples of commonly seen carbohydrate-related biomarkers.",

However, up until recently, there has been essentially no effort in the development of carbohydrate \"binders\" as potential medicinal and imaging agents. Effort in making fluorescent carbohydrate \"binders\" (fluorescent sensors) has been largely limited to mono-or disaccharides for potential analytical chemistry work including glucose detection33 -61 with a few exceptions.62 -65 There had been essentially no activity in developing \"binders\" for glycoproteins with the ability to differentiate glycoforms until recently when the Wang lab developed a platform approach to select DNA-based aptamers for such applications.66 A major issue in this field that is hindering the development of carbohydrate recognition-based therapeutic and diagnostic agents is the difficulty in the design and synthesis of highly specific and tight carbohydrate \"binders.\" Chemical approaches to this issue will be addressed in detail later in this review.",

The detailed descriptions of the carbohydrate recognition sections below also give a glimps of the somewhat \"silo\" approaches in the literature. For example, when one reads the chemical approaches, lectin approaches, and the biological applications discussed in the following sections, they sometimes seem to come from different worlds. A large percentage of publications on carbohydrate sensing and recognition from chemistry labs are mostly focused on the chemistry issues and not directly addressing important glycobiological problems. Of course, such a situation has its historical reasons. For a long time, the chemistry knowledge and platform tehnologies were not there to apply chemical approaches to address complex glycobiological problems through carbohydrate recognition. However, efforts in recent years have shown great promise for the future development of a large number of carbohydrate binders for various therapeutic, diagnostic, and detection applications. The carbohydrate recognition field is poised to make significant inroads in the biomedical application direction if the significance of such research is widely recognized. In doing so, the chemical and biological fields can and should work together and help each other in addressing some of the most fundmental unanswered questions in carbohydrate recognition and in applying new chemistry tools to solve glycobiology problems. One of the aims of this review is to present carbohydrate recognition studies from different angles, in one place, to facilitate communications among glyco-researchers in different discinplines. The examples will mostly be those published in the last five years. It is hoped that this review will stimulate more research and ideas in taking carbohydrate recognition research to the direction of addressing complex glycobiological and disease problems.",

            "text": "Available carbohydrate \"binders\" can be classified into the following four categories: (1) antibodies,134 , 135 (2) lectins, 6 , 136 (3) aptamers based on nucleic acids, 137 , 138 and (4) small molecule lectin mimics. 36 Of course, antibodies and derivatives have long been the gold standard in the recognition of a variety of analytes including carbohydrates. 68 , 70 , 75 , 79 , 109 , 115 , 116 , 139 However, in research, antibodies have not been widely used in large scale applications such as in arrays. Presumably, cost and stability are factors. Currently, lectins are the major available tools in research for carbohydrate recognition. However, the available lectins often have cross reactivity issues. Therefore, there is a need to develop alternatives for carbohydrate recognition that meet the following criteria: (1) high affinity, (2) high specificity, and (3) suitable for high throughput analysis. The high affinity and specificity points are easy to understand. The need for high throughput stems from the recent interests in studying carbohydrate/glycan changes at the glycome level. 67 , 140 -148 To meet these criteria there have been a great deal of recent interest in developing fluorescent sensing methods for carbohydrates for various applications. 34 , 149 -155 In this regard, there have been very active efforts in developing small molecules and \"polymeric\" \"binders\" for carbohydrates. Along this line, there have been work in using the boronic acid moiety as the key recognition unit for carbohydrate sensor development. 34 , 149 -155 We have termed these boronic acid-based carbohydrate sensors/binders as boronolectins because they mimic the function of lectins and contain the boronic acid unit.36 Therefore, there are small molecule boronolectins (SBL),33 , 155 , 156 peptidoboronolectins (PBL),44 , 157 -159 and nucleic acid-based boronolectins (NBL). 66 , 137 There has also been effort in taking advantage of non-covalent interactions such as hydrophobic, hydrogen bond, and ionic interactions, 160 and interactions with metals for the design of carbohydrate receptors. 34 , 82 , 161 Sporadic efforts have also been reported in using aptamers as way to achieve carbohydrate recognition and sensing. 162 , 163 Recently, the Wang lab has developed a platform method for the selection of DNA aptamers for glycoproteins with the ability to differentiate glycosylation variations.66 This review will discuss progress and future prospects of all three areas along with the current state of using lectins for carbohydrate profiling and analysis. Ways to develop antibodies against carbohydrates, though important, will not be covered in this review for two reasons. First, antibody production is a mature method, which does not face the same kind of challenges and issues as the development of small molecule binders and applications of lectins. Second, though there are many commercially available carbohydrate antibodies, they are not described in the kind of mechanistic details with K d and selectivity information to allow for careful contrast and analysis.",

However, there has never been a systematic effort to study their binding with diols in a quantitative fashion. Aimed at achieving some fundamental understanding of amidoboronic acid-diol interactions, the Wang lab synthesized and studied the binding of a model \u03b1-amidoboronic acid ( Figure 1 ) with various carbohydrates and other diol-containing. 172 As expected, this compound showed good water-solubility, comparable affinity for carbohydrates as arylboronic acids, and significant fluorescent property changes upon carbohydrate binding.",

            "text": "Boronic acid (1) is called an acid because of its boron open shell, which allows for reaction with a protic solvent molecule such as water to form an anionic tetrahedral boronate (2) with the release of one proton (Scheme 1). The deprotonation of the boronic acid hydroxyl group has a higher pK a than the boron open shell reaction with water or alcohol and is actually very hard after anion formation. Therefore, the acidity of a boronic acid is derived from its Lewis acidity per se. In this context, a boronic acid can react with a variety of Lewis bases such as hydroxyl, sulfhydryl, and amino groups as well as fluoride and cyanide. After reacting with a diol, boronic acid is converted to boronic ester (3), which is also an acid much the same way as a boronic acid-it can react with a water molecule, release a proton, and give the boronate ester species (4) (Scheme 1). It is important to note that binding with a diol actually lowers the pK a of the boron atom in most cases. 173 , 174 Not all boronic acids bind with the diol moiety with the same affinity and not all diols bind to a boronic acid with the same affinity. Understanding the intrinsic preference in binding is very important to the design of boronic acid-based carbohydrate \"binders.\" Though not always true, boronic acids with low pK a values tend to have high intrinsic affinities. 3 , 156 , 173 , 174 For the diol portion, several factors could affect their intrinsic affinities for boronic acids. Low pK a values, small O-C-C-O dihedral angles, and restricted rotations around the C-C bond of the diol moiety all favor binding.174 It is commonly believed that high pH favors boronic acid binding to diols. This is actually not always true. Optimal binding depends on the interplay of the pK a values of the boronic acid and diol, and solution pH.156 , 174 The optimal pH for binding is often between the pK a values of the boronic acid and diol compounds. With low pK a diols such as catechols, the optimal binding pH could be below physiological pH. 156 , 174 Other factors such as solvent, buffer, and steric hindrance should also be considered when examining the binding between a diol and a boronic acid. 156 , 173 , 174 There are two ways of looking at the binding between a boronic acid and a diol. The first way is to look at individual reactions and binding between either the trigonal boronic acid (1, Scheme 1), or the tetrahedral boronate (2, Scheme 1) with a diol. In such a representation, K trig represents the binding constant between the trigonal form 1 of boronic acid and the boronic ester 3; K tet describes the equilibrium between the tetrahedral form 2 of boronic acid and boronate ester 4. The binding equilibrium between phenylboronic acid and a diol can also be presented in Scheme 2, which describes the overall binding equilibrium between boronic acid/boronate 1, 2 and boronic and boronate esters 3, 4.156 K eq is used to describe the overall binding constant (Scheme 2), which of course is an apparent binding constant, but is directly relevant to the equilibrium between a sensor and a carbohydrate. In the literature, binding constants commonly refer to the apparent overall binding constant, K eq , which does not take into consideration of the ionization states of either the complexed or the free form of a boronic acid. 173 , 174 There are several methods for determining binding constants between boronic acids and diols including the pH depression method,3 B-NMR method,209 -211 and spectroscopic methods. 156 , 183 The pH depression method is rarely used now because of its requirement for a large amount of sample and the fact it only gives the K tet values, not the overall binding constants.156 , 173 The B-NMR method suffers from similar shortcomings as the pH depression method. Furthermore, isotope effects are often not considered in NMR-based methods, which use deuterated solvents. Therefore, spectroscopic methods are normally the preferred choice whenever possible, especially when dealing with boronic acids that change spectroscopic properties upon diol binding.36 , 155 For those boronic acids that do not change spectroscopic properties upon diol binding and therefore cannot be detected directly by a spectroscopic method, the Wang lab introduced a three-component competition assay by using Alizarin Red S. (ARS) as a fluorescent reporter compound for the sensitive determination of binding constants. 156 , 173 , 212 From the salient features of the boronic acid-Lewis base (including hydroxyl groups and diols) interactions briefly described above, it is easy to understand why boronic acids are very useful in carbohydrate recognition. However, since monoboronic acids have their intrinsic preference in binding with carbohydrates,3 , 156 , 173 , 174 additional functional interactions are needed if the desired selectivity of the boronic acid-based sensors is different from the intrinsic preference of monoboronic acids, which is essentially all the time. The additional interactions can be boronic acid-based in situations of bis-63 , 64 , 150 or multi-boronic acids213 or the use of other types of interactions such as anionic interactions. 214 , 215 Therefore, in developing boronic acid-based carbohydrates sensors, it is important to have the appropriate scaffold and functional group arrangements. Another important issue is the availability of boronic acid fluorescent reporters, which change fluorescent properties upon binding. 36 , 155 The following section will discuss recent developments in using boronic acids for carbohydrate detection.",

It was said that the fluorescence of the anthracene fluorophore can be quenched by the electron-rich tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) through excited state photoelectron transfer (PET). Addition of a sugar such as fructose could increase the fluorescence intensity of the boronic acid reporter by 5-fold at physiological pH in THF/H 2 O (1:1, v/v). The binding constant of 5 with fructose is 115 M \u22121 . The compound has an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and emission wavelength of 419 nm. The mechanism through which this fluorescent intensity change occurs was proposed to involve the competition of PET between the process involving TTF and boronate and the process involving TTF and the anthracene unit. It was reasoned that binding of the boronic acid moiety results in the conversion of the boronic acid unit to the more acidic boronic ester, which is a stronger acid than the starting boronic acid and therefore should be a better electron \"sink\" to compete for PET. This increased competition for electron transfer from TTF was thought as the reason for the enhanced fluorescence observed. However, one factor that was not considered was that upon conversion of the boronic to its boronic ester form, it would be converted to the tetrahedral anionic boronate ester because of the increased acidity. 36 , 173 , 174 Once it is in the anionic tetrahedral form, the boronate ester can no longer accept electrons in a PET process. More studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism through which the fluorescence intensity changes upon sugar binding. In addition, this compound has poor water solubility and requires lengthy synthesis. Such issues could hinder applications in certain situations.",

This mixture showed a red shift (293 to 303 nm) at one emission wavelength and blue shift (329 to 314 nm) at the other upon sugar binding. Among these reporters, 7-BTBA has the highest binding affinity with sorbitol (K a = 4561 M \u22121 ) and fructose (K a =1342 M \u22121 ). One limitation of this series of reporters is their relatively small fluorescent intensity changes (1 fold) upon sugar binding and the short emission and excitation wavelengths. The fluorescent property changes at two wavelengths on the other hand are an advantage, which allows for ratiometric sensing.",

            "text": "A bisboronic acid fluorescent sorbitol sensor based on the anthracene fluorophore was synthesized and studied by Yoon and co-workers ( Figure 7) . 264 All fluorescent studies were conducted in 50% MeOH/0.1 M aqueous phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 and by using a 6 \u03bcM concentration of compound 27 (\u03bb ex = 365 nm, \u03bb em = 420 nm). The binding constants of chemosensor 27 with sorbitol, xylitol, fructose, galactose and glucose were 1060, 440, 200, 81 and 12 M \u22121 with fluorescent intensity increases by 2.2, 1.9, 3.9, 2.9 and 2.3 fold, respectively. Such results clearly show that the designed sensor prefers sorbitol, though monoboronic acid also preferentially binds to sorbitol with an over 2-fold selectivity over fructose. 173 , 174 , 212 , 264 Based on earlier work,63 , 150 Wang and co-workers synthesized and evaluated additional anthracene-based bisboronic acid sensors for various saccharides.231 , 265 As shown in Figure 8 , a series of new anthracene-based bisboronic fluorescent sensors (28a-d) and three fluorescent monoboronic as controls (29b-c) were synthesized.63 , 64 , 156 , 231 These sensors use the anthracene-based fluorophore (29a) first developed by Shinkai and co-workers. 33 , 266 Compound 28a was published earlier as a selective glucose sensor.150 These new compounds (28b-d) were designed to examine substituent effect on binding and selectivity. Both cyano-(28b) and nitro-substituted (28c) sensors had higher apparent binding constants for glucose (K a = 2540 and 1808 M \u22121 , respectively) than the un-substituted sensor (28a) (1472 M \u22121 ). Although the fluoro-substituted bisfluoroboronic acid (28d) had a lower apparent binding constant (K a = 630 M \u22121 ), it has the best selectivity for glucose under near physiological conditions. Compared to 28a, the selectivity for glucose over fructose did decrease for all the new sensors (28b-c) with the K aglucose /K afructose ratio changing from 43 to 3. The binding affinity trend for the bisboronic acids (28a-c) parallels that of the monoboronic acid building blocks (29b-c). Such results suggest that the affinity of the bisboronic acids (29b,c) for glucose was largely correlated with the intrinsic affinity of the boronic acid moiety. Moreover, the introduction of an electron-withdrawing group does not always result in enhanced affinity. Hence, the effect of the electron-withdrawing group on the selectivity and affinity of the bisboronic acid sensors for glucose is hard to predict. In this series, 28b showed the best binding affinity and the highest fluorescent intensity increase (10 fold) upon binding with glucose. Sensor 28a showed the best selectivity of glucose. This series of compounds have an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and emission wavelength of 425 to 430 nm. One issue with these anthracene-based bisboronic acid sensors is their lack of water solubility and the need for organic co-solvent in binding studies. In addition, the fluorescence intensity of the anthracene fluorophore seems to be very sensitive to environmental changes and careful controls have to be done under the same conditions in order for results to be comparable. Temperature, oxygen content, and solvents all seem to significantly affect the fluorescence intensity of these sensors. Based on stereochemistry studies, the authors proposed that the selectivity of ribose was due to the 2, 3-cis diol structure, and also due to the formation a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of the boronate ester and hydrogen from the amine of 30 ( Figure 9 , complex 33). Carbohydrates, which can share the same hydroxyl configurations (2, 3-cis diol) as ribofuranose such as allose, psicose, adenosine and nucleotide, may behave similarly as ribose. This is the first example of a boronic acid-based chemosensor for ribose with such significant selectivity. In addition, the solution of 30 (0.07 mM) containing 32 (1.9 mM) was observed to generate micromolar level of chromophore 31 in situ, which gave spectroscopic property changes. Furthermore, sensor 32 (1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 M) changed fluorescent intensity by 1 fold upon binding with lactulose and maltulose, comparing to other di-and trisaccharides (1.85 \u00d7 10 \u22123 M), such as lactose, maltose, raffinose, and sucrose, which show no fluorescent intensity changes. Their systems possess good sensitivity and selectivity for the target saccharides. Studies were conducted in 9:1 DMSO/phosphate buffer (0.05 M, pH 7.4), which suggests that water solubility may need further improvement.",

            "text": "Though boronic acids are known to bind diol-containing compounds, they have different intrinsic preference for diols of different structures.3 , 173 , 174 As described earlier, diols with small dihedral angles and low pK a values tend to have a higher intrinsic affinity for boronic acids. Along this line, it is well-recognized that boronic acids bind to diols on aryl and five-membered rings much more tightly than that on six-membered rings. With bisboronic acids, proper design allows for the construction of sensors that can recognize sixmembered ring diols with high affinity.208 , 275 However, with monoboronic acids, the situation is different. Often the binding of a boronic acid with a diol on a six-membered ring is so weak that it is hard to measure a binding constant under near physiological conditions. The only exception is pinanediol,167 , 276 which is often used as a boronic acid protecting group. Even with bisboronic acid, sometimes the binding would start with the recognition of the six-membered ring form and then slowly rearrange to form the complex with a 5membered ring diol. 150 , 186 , 200 The preference by boronic acids for diols on fivemembered rings is especially problematic for the recognition of saccharides released from or as part of a glycoprotein/peptide or glycolipid. This is because these glycans tend to have only linear diols and diols on six-membered rings. Because there have been considerable interests in sensors for many types of glycoproteins,62 , 63 , 150 , 277 , 278 including glycated hemoglobin 160 , 279 , 280 and immunoglobulin G,281 there has also been a high level of interest in finding boronic acids that have enhanced ability to recognize diols on a sixmembered ring. Along this line, the Hall lab has recently reported an ortho-hydroxymethyl phenylboronic acid (39a, Figure 14 ),190 which can recognize 1,3-diols on a six-membered ring. The design takes advantage of the known effect of a similarly positioned amino group (39b) reported by Wulff,204 which helps to improve the intrinsic binding affinity of the boronic acid unit. In neutral aqueous media, this boronic acid 39c could complex hexopyranosides primarily using their 4,6-diol, which is presented on most cell-surface glycoconjugates (Scheme 7). The binding constants of 39a with glycopyranosides were obtained by using the ARS UV assay at neutral pH (7.4) in water.173 , 212 The K a with methyl \u03b1-D-glucopyranoside was 22 M \u22121 , which was slightly lower than the binding constant with glucose. In contrast, the binding constant of phenylboronic acid with glucose is about 5 M \u22121 at physiological pH.173 , 212 In addition, the Hall compound also has good water solubility and is structurally simple. One can envision a wide variety of applications of this very special boronic acid. Using the same system (ortho-hydroxymethyl substituted phenylboronic acids) developed by the Hall lab, Hindsgaul and co-workers have developed a method for visual analysis of the terminal glycosylation of glycoproteins. 282 The key point of this assay is the application of a boronic acid-based dye reagent, tetramethylrhodamine-boronic acid 40 (TMR-B, \u03bb em : 579 nm), as shown in Figure 15 and Scheme 8. In this method, galactose (or other sugars) can be released from a glycoprotein using an enzyme. The released galactose then can be reacted with an immobilized amine. Subsequent reaction with TMR-B through boronic acid-diol complexation then allows for labeling and visualization of the beads based on the presence of the immobilized sugar. The bound TMR-B can also be released by adding a solution of glycerol/MeOH/H 2 O (1:2:2) to the beads for solution quantitation since the amount of released fluorescent boronate should be proportional to that of immobilized sugar. Using this method, several sugars including galactose (Gal, a hexose), fucose (Fuc, a deoxyhexose), sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid, Neu5Ac), and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc, an aminodeoxyhexose) were analyzed by following the capture/dye-binding/washing sequence for each sugar at 40 \u03bcM. The results showed that the relative responses of Gal/Fuc/Neu5Ac/ GlcNAc were 1: 0.67: 0.59: 0.36.",

            "text": "There have been many studies of polymer-based arylboronic acid sensors for saccharides. 46 For instance, as shown in Scheme 9, Tao and co-workers invented a new fluorometric glucose detection strategy by utilizing complexation with boronic acid (41,42) on polycation (43) . The formation of a 2:1 complex between compound 41 and glucose (Scheme 9) was the general design for this method. In their studies, boronic acid 42 was used for the fluorescent binding evaluation, and polycation 43 was used to enrich 42 along its polymer chain by electrostatic interaction. The fluorescent boronic acid 42 emits at 376 nm as a monomer. After binding with glucose to form a 2:1 complex, two pyrenyl groups from two molecules of 42 along with 43 would stack and generate an excimer. The polymer chain changes its conformation due to a change of the charge state of boron (from the trigonal form to the tetrahedral form) induced by the 2:1 binding with glucose. This conformational change triggers a change of fluorescent intensity, which can be used to monitoring the binding process. Other sugars such as fructose and galactose did not show such a strong tendency to form a 1:2 complex with a boronic acid as did glucose. Therefore this method could be used for sensing glucose selectively. Complexation results in the generation of excimer emission in the range of 430-600 nm (\u03bb ex : 342 nm). 46 The fluorescent studies were conducted in aqueous solution containing 10 mM glucose buffered with 10 mM of NH 3 (pH = 10) in the presence of 43 (310 mM). The fluorescent intensity ratio of 482 nm to 376 nm (I 482 /I 376 ) was increased by 10 fold with glucose binding. On the other hand, the increase of I 482 /I 376 with fructose, galactose and ribose was less than 2 fold. The limit of this system is that it functions only under alkaline conditions, which could be improved by lowering the pK a of the boronic acid through the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups.",

Then the boronate ester could diffuse through the membrane and hydrolyze back to the boronic acid and release the saccharide to the receiving phase. The transport of fructose and glucose through supported liquid membrane (SLM) promoted by several tetrahedron-shaped lipophilic monoboronic acids and diboronic acids was examined. The selectivity was measured by the ratio of sugar fluxes between fructose and glucose. The diboronic acid gave high fructose/glucose selectivity (7.7:1.0). As shown in Figure 18 , their diboronic acid carriers could bind with multiple equivalents of D-fructose to form two types of diesters (51 and 52) in the membrane. The method of transporting D-fructose by 51 showed better selectivity for D-fructose over glucose than did 52. It was proposed that the selectivity was due to the formation of a tridentate 2, 3, 6-\u03b2-D-fructofuranose diester 51 and a macrocyclic D-fructopyranose diester 52 within the membrane. This suggestion was supported by computer molecular modeling studies and 13 C NMR experiments with labeled 13 C-Dfructose. 306 Duggan and co-workers also studied the transport of four sialic acid derivatives through lipophilic supported liquid membranes.307 Aliquat 336, a lipophilic quaternary ammonium chloride salt, was added into the membrane to promote the transporting of the sialic acid derivatives. The flux of sialic acid derivatives in the membrane containing Aliquat 336 alone was higher than those in the other two membrane systems (boronic acid alone or boronic acid in combination with Aliquat 336). A mobile-site jumping mechanism was proposed to explain the flux improvement by lipophilic ion pairs. It was proposed that the triol side chain and the amide functional group of sialic acid derivatives form a chloride receptor. The sugar-chloride complex hops from cation to cation in the membrane and then release into the receiving phase. The reason for the impaired transport when a boronic acid is present could be due to the abolishment of the chloride binding ability of the triol side upon boronate formation. It was also interesting to note the very different effect Aliquat 336 has on sialic acid derivatives and D-fructose. For the transport of D-fructose, the flux through ammonium boronate membrane is detectable, while no transport was detected with the membrane containing either boronic acid or ammonium chloride alone. The studies of logP values suggested that D-fructose was more hydrophilic than the four sialic acid derivatives, which explains why only the transport of D-fructose through a lipophilic membrane is favored by the mixture of a lipophilic boronic acid and a lipophilic ammonium salt.",

Their studies suggested that boronate ion was not as reactive as boronic acid in an alkaline solution.

Tao and co-workers evaluated glucose sensing with boronic acid using enzymatic oxidation. 47 In their studies, the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) catalyzed the conversion of glucose into gluconic acid, which was able to complex with a fluorescent boronic acid through the hydroxycarboxylate moiety in aqueous media. This method could overcome the weak binding issue between glucose and boronic acid because of the relatively strong interactions between gluconic acid and boronic acid.

For the synthesis of these two sensors, boronic acid groups were connected either to a \u03b2-pyrrolic position or to the meso-position of the porphyrin core. However, no spectroscopic property changes were observed with the addition of sugars.",

Although several methods including electrophoresis, derivative fluorimetric and pulsed amperometric detection had been reported,336 -339 neomycin B detection was still a challenging problem because these reported methods were time consuming and neomycin lacked the needed spectroscopic and electrochemical properties. Therefore, a competitive impedimetric assay for the detection of neomycin B was conducted by using a fully 2\u2032-O-methylated RNA aptamer sensor, which was developed based on previous RNA motifs. 340 , 341 The O-methylation helped to increase the stability of the aptamer against degrading enzymes. In this approach, neomycin B was first immobilized on a self-assembled monolayer of mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) (Scheme 12). Then aptamer was bound to surface linked neomycin B. Neomycin B in solution can competitively displace the bound aptamer and the dissociation was monitored by using faradaic impedance spectroscopy (FIS). With this method, a 1:1 neomycin-aptamer complex was observed under near physiological conditions. High specific affinity was also found by comparing with binding of paromomycin, which differs from neomycin B in the substitution of a single NH 2 group by an OH group at C 6 . Such results confirmed the previous report that the 100-fold lower binding affinity of paromomycin relative to neomycin341 was not affected by the use of 2\u2032-O-Me bases.

Thus, blocking the binding of the sialyllactose and animal viruses on cell surface could be a route to the development of anti-viral agent. Sawai and coworkers produced a novel cationic-charged modified DNA aptamer by using modified thymidine residues.344 The idea is to use the cationic protonated amino group at the C 5 position to help enhancing the binding affinity with the anionic carboxyl group of sialyllactose.

Another fact that is remarkable in this study is that the aptamers selectively bind to an unsaturated lipid chain of moenomycin in contrast to the farnesylated Ras aptamer binding with the saturated part chain. 348 The authors suggested that the difference might have originated from the different configuration of the isoprenoid moieties.",

The Wang lab worked on using boronic acid-modified DNA for the selection of aptamers for the specific recognition of the glycosylation site(s) of a glycoprotein.137 , 349 As discussed in the previous section, boronic acid is known to high intrinsic high affinity for diols and hydroxyl groups.

Fibrinogen was used as a model glycoprotein because of its known association with the risk of major cardiovascular diseases and nonvascular mortality and the critical role of its carbohydrate moiety in fibrinogen function.31 , 361 The SELEX approach was used for the aptamer selection. Aptamers were selected with K d in the range of low to mid nM.349 More importantly, removal of the boronic acid, the glycan moiety or both resulted in significantly decreased affinities. Furthermore, sugar and boronic acid can competitively inhibit aptamer binding to fibrinogen. In contrast, aptamers selected without using boronic acid-modified TTP did not bind to the glycosylation sites. All such results suggest that indeed boronic acid modified DNA aptamers can be selected to specifically recognize the glycosylation site(s) of a glycoprotein. The same method can be used for the selection of boronic acid modified DNA based aptamers for other glycoproteins. This represents the very first example that aptamers can be selected to specifically focus on the glycan substructure in a glycoprotein.

Specifically, the Anslyn lab selected an aptamer that could bind to the complex between bis-boronic acid receptor 57a ( Figure 23 ) and tartrate. 163 First, organic receptor 57163 , 362 was immobilized on glyoxal agarose beads through reductive amination. Then the immobilized receptor 58a (Figure 23 ) in complexation with tartrate was used for the selection and control compound 58b, which was incapable of binding tartrate, was used for counter selection. The progress of the selection was monitored by incorporating a radiolabel into the RNA pool. After 13 round of selection, no further improvement in binding was detected. The selected aptamers were then cloned, sequenced, and used for binding studies. Several interesting observations were made. First, aptamer binding appeared to be dependent on methanol and the optimal methanol concentration for binding was around 20%. This was one of the first examples of aptamer selection that has been carried out in high concentrations of an organic solvent. Second, on its own, 57 was only slightly selective for citrate (1.3, K d for tartrate = 7.1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 M, K d for citrate = 5.5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ). However, in the presence of aptamer, the specificity of the receptor was dramatically altered (14 for tartrate, K d = 2.1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 and K d < 3 \u00d7 10 \u22123 for citrate in 20% MeOH). The explanation is that aptamer might form a pocket more precisely accommodate the receptortartrate complex, while exclude citrate via steric interactions or charge repulsion. Third, lower affinity of 57 for tartrate in the context of the aptamer was also found. The author explained that at least part of the tartrate-binding energy is used to generate an induced-fit conformation. In summary, by generating an aptamer-receptor complex for the recognition, the author successfully selected an aptamer for a small organic ligand. This work shows a novel route to the development of biosensors for small organic analytes and can serve as a model for future applications to improve the specificity of synthetic receptors.",

The interactions between hosts 59-62 and glucopyranosides were investigated by 1 In order to test the importance of the presence of pyridine nitrogen in the complex, compound 61 ( Figure 24 ) was further designed and its binding affinity with sugar was studied by extraction experiments. Different from compound 59, compound 61 showed very poor solubility in chloroform even at high concentrations of glucopyranosides. The results suggest that without the hydrogen bond interactions involving the pyridine nitrogen, glucopyranosides could not pull the receptor into the solution, an indication of lack of binding. Due to the solubility problem of compound 61, the dimethylphenyl derivative 65 ( Figure 24 ) with better solubility was also synthesized for binding studies. The K a value (750 M \u22121 ) was more than 11-fold lower than that of the complex between 59 and 63 (K a = 8.7 \u00d7 10 3 M \u22121 ), which further confirmed the importance of hydrogen bonding between pyridine nitrogen and OH groups of glucopyranosides in complex formation. To examine the need for three pyridine rings for tight binding, the binding constants of receptor 62 were also determined. Compared with 59, much lower K a values (1.1 \u00d7 10 3 M \u22121 and 460 M \u22121 for 63 and 64 respectively) were obtained. The smaller binding constants for 62 implied the importance of the three pyridine rings for tight binding.",

            "text": "Similar to previous experiments, compound 67 was also designed to demonstrate the significance of the \"three-point\" recognition model. As expected, lower binding affinity (K a = 4.5 \u00d7 10 3 M \u22121 ) was obtained, as compared to compound 66, presumably due to the lack of the third arm for binding. To quantify the influence of the amide NH protons on the formation of binding complex, the binding constant of compound 68 with the replacement of the amide bond by an ester bond was also determined to be 800 M \u22121 , which was more than 10-fold lower than that of the complex between 59 and 63 (K a = 8.7 \u00d7 10 3 M \u22121 ). Such results are consistent with the hypothesis that the amide N-H is very important for binding. Of course, It is also possible that the ester bonds are much more flexible, which would make the receptor molecule less rigid and result in lower binding affinity. Another interesting experiment done by Mazik and co-workers is the design and binding affinity experiments of compound 69 (Figure 25 ), which has an added coumarin ring for additional van der Waals interactions with 63. The 4-fold higher binding affinity (K a = 4.3 \u00d7 10 3 M \u22121 ) as compared to that of 62 and 63 (K a = 1.1 \u00d7 10 3 M \u22121 ) indicates that appropriately positioned additional hydrophobic interactions, similar as in protein-sugar complexes, are beneficial to binding. Furthermore, new effective pyridine-based receptors 70-72 ( Figure 26 ) were designed with replacement of the central phenyl ring by a trimethylphenyl ring to involve more effective CH-\u03c0 interactions with the CH's of sugar molecules. 370 The second methyl group at the 4position of the pyridine ring in host 71 and an additional amino group in host 72 were incorporated to increase the basicity of the pyridine moiety. The binding constants, again, were determined by 1 H NMR experiments. In this study, different ratios were used between the receptor and sugar. This was to examine whether the binding stoichiometry and whether cooperative binding was involved. The results are shown in Table III. The binding constants were determined in chloroform at 25 \u00b0C by titration experiments. The stoichiometry of receptor-sugar complexation was obtained by curve-fitting analysis of the titration data and molar ratio plots. K a1 and K a2 were defined as binding constant of 1:1 and 1:2 receptor-sugar complexation respectively. The signal in NMR from the amine NH moved downfield and methylene CH 2 moved upfield upon binding. Such results suggested the formation of hydrogen bonds between these groups and the sugar hydroxyls. The relative low solubility of the \u03b1-anomer glucopyranoside 74 comparing to the \u03b2-anomer 73 in the presence of receptor 71 provided additional evidence for the preference of \u03b2-anomer. Specifically, during the extraction experiment, 0.7 equiv of \u03b2-anomer 73 was extracted into the CDCl 3 solution of receptor 71. Besides, after binding with 73, the NH and pyridine CH 1 H NMR signals showed significant change in chemical shift, which further indicate complexation. In contrast, \u03b1-anomer 74 was not extracted at nearly the same efficiency. It is interesting to note that after addition of a small amount of water (0.07%) to the chloroform solutions, the binding affinity increases by a factor of 2-3. This increase in binding might be due to the formation of water-mediated hydrogen bonds, in line with similar observations in protein-carbohydrate complexes.364",

Again, K a1 was defined as 1:1 binding constant of receptor-sugar complex, while K a3 was defined as 2:1 binding constant of receptor-sugar complex. The results showed that when the methyl group was in the \u03b1-position (70), lower binding affinity (K a1 = 8.7 \u00d7 10 3 M \u22121 ) was observed as compared to situations when the methyl group is far away from the pyridine nitrogen (K a3 = 2.4 \u00d7 10 4 for 75-63 and 2.3 \u00d7 10 4 M \u22121 for 76-63 respectively). For receptor 59, 1:1 binding was observed. Such results indicate that steric hindrance near the pyridine nitrogen plays an important role in affecting the binding. Decreased steric hindrance at the pyridine nitrogen increased the binding affinity of host (K a3 = 2.4 \u00d7 10 4 for 75-63 and 2.3 \u00d7 10 4 M \u22121 for 76-63 respectively). One interesting thing is that, unlike 59, compounds 75 and 76 showed inversed selectivity, i.e., binding favors the \u03b1-anomer (64, Figure 24 ) instead of the \u03b2-anomer (63, Figure 24 ). In the case of compound 59, the axial 1-alkoxy group in \u03b1-anomer 64 can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the 2-OH group more easily than the equatorial 1-alkoxy substituent in \u03b2-anomer 63, therefore, the 2-OH group in \u03b2-anomer 63 is relatively free from intramolecular bonding, thus can bind with receptors more tightly. However, in the case of binding of compounds 75 or 76 with \u03b1-anomer 64, the intermolecular host-guest interactions might play a more important role than the intramolecular H-bonding network, which contributes to the higher binding of 75 or 76 with \u03b1-anomer 64.",

Again, K a1 is used to designate the binding constant of a 1:1 receptor-sugar complex and K a2 is used to designate a 1:2 receptorsugar complex. Incorporation of the carboxylate group improved binding considerably both in organic and aqueous media. Receptor 87 exhibited at least 100-fold higher affinity for \u03b2glucopyranoside (K a1 = 1.2 \u00d7 10 5 M \u22121 and K a2 = 4.7 \u00d7 10 3 M \u22121 ) than the previously described tri-armed pyridine-based receptor 70 (K a1 = 1.1 \u00d7 10 4 M \u22121 and K a2 = 250 M \u22121 ). Besides, compound 87 shows a preference for the \u03b2-anomer in the recognition of glucopyranosides (K a1 = 1. By using the same strategy, the Mazik lab also designed and synthesized compounds 88 and 89 ( Figure 30 ).368 In this case, crown ether was incorporated as another binding site instead of a carboxylate group. The crown ether moiety was designed for hydrogen-bonding interactions with sugar. Again binding constants were determined using 1 H NMR binding titrations and extraction experiments. The data were fitted into a 1:1 (K a1 ) and a 2:1 (K a3 ) binding model to give K a1 of 5.8 \u00d7 10 5 Inspired by the binding affinity of designed receptors with disaccharides, Mazik and coworkers further developed a new biphenyl-based receptor 90 for the recognition of disaccharides (91\u03b1 and 91\u03b2, Figure 31 ). 373 The hypothesis for this design was that the four heterocyclic recognition groups based on the 2-aminopyridine unit would provide an excellent structural motif for hydrogen bonding. The biphenyl spacer of 90 should provide additional nonpolar contacts to the saccharides. Binding affinity was determined by 1 H NMR with K a > 10 6 M \u22121 for 91\u03b2 in water-containing chloroform solutions (1:10, 1:20) when the data were fitted into a 2:1 (receptor/maltoside) model. Based on spectroscopic changes, it seems that at the initial stage, a 2:1 complex was formed. This was gradually replaced by a 1:1 complex. Compared with the binding of 91\u03b2, 91\u03b1 has very poor solubility in chloroform in the presence of receptor 90 indicating weak binding affinity and good \u03b2/\u03b1 selectivity. The relative low binding affinity of 90 for 63 (K a1 = 1.1 \u00d7 10 4 M \u22121 , K a2 = 300 M \u22121 ) indicates preference for disaccharides.",

The structure of 95 was determined by spectroscopic characterization and single crystal X-ray crystallography. Binding experiments were performed by using 1 H NMR in CDCl 3 and a 1:1 stoichiometry with an association constant of 4.8 \u00d7 10 4 M \u22121 with octyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (Oct\u03b2Glc) was obtained. Interestingly, 95 has very high selectivity for the \u03b2 anomer showing exclusive binding when observed using NMR. The author ascribed the excellent binding to both a precise size fit of the \u03b2-glucoside and an excellent complementarity of the amino/pyrrole group compared to the amide group, which is normally used for hydrogen bonding to a sugar moiety. Another interesting observation is that the precursor compound 94, which has a similar structure as 95, did not exhibit the same binding ability. Addition of Oct\u03b2Glc did not show evidence of complexation. Solubility experiment was further conducted to probe the binding affinity and selectivity. Methyl-\u03b2-Dglucopyranoside (Me\u03b2Glc) is insoluble in CDCl 3 , however, when it was shaken with a 1 mM solution of 95 in CDCl 3 , the solid was partially dissolved and the NMR spectra showed that over 40% of the cage was present in the complex form. The bound percentage was increased to 50% in CCl 4 and 75% in C 6 D 6 . Another competitive experiment to study selectivity was performed by feeding 95 with an equal molar mixture of Oct\u03b2Glc and other selected glycosides. There was less than 10% decrease of binding fraction of 95 with Oct\u03b2Glc after addition of various glycosides as compared with binding in the absence of competitors. In summary, the Roelens lab designed and successfully synthesized a selfassembled macrobicyclic cage 95, which can specifically recognize the \u03b2 anomer of Dglucose and its alkyl glucosides with high K a .",

In the helix form, pyridine rings line up in a cisoid conformation and all the pyridine nitrogen pointed to the inside of pore. Since the pore provides a \"low-entropy\" location compared to the protic solvent molecules outside, which can form hydrogen bonds with each other, the included solvent molecules in the pore thus can be substituted by other hydrogen-bonding substrate such as carbohydrate. The structure of amphiphilic polymer 107 in solution was investigated by UV/vis, 1 H NMR and fluorescence spectra.

It seemed that the chirality of the saccharide was transferred to the helical sense of the polymer as evidenced by the appearance of induced CDs (ICDs) in the absorptive region of the polymer. The binding constants were determined to be 14, 5.5 and 4.4 M \u22121 with D-mannose, D-fructose and D-allose, respectively. However, no significant binding was found with saccharides in 100% of water. The problem of weak binding in aqueous solution can be attributed to two conflicting factors: (1) solvophobic interactions, which cause the helix formation, are favored in water and disfavored in MeOH, and (2) hydrogen bonding, which is the driving force for saccharide recognition, is advantageous in MeOH and disadvantageous in water. More work is needed to improve binding affinity in aqueous environment. (Figure 35 ). 382 The design of 108 drew lessons from sugar-protein interactions, which again rely on both hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions. The target of 108, the \u03b2-D-glucopyranoside unit 109, possesses axial CH groups and equatorial directed hydroxyl groups ( Figure 35 ). Therefore, for complementary interactions, it is desirable that the binding cavity have parallel aryl rings, appropriately spaced and linked by moieties capable of hydrogen-binding. The tricyclic structure of 108 has two biphenyl rings and eight amide groups that appear to fit these criteria quite well. Molecular modeling on the analogous tetramethyl ester indicated that the cavity defined by the biphenyl and benzene 1, 3-dicarboxamide was able to accept a \u03b2-Dglucopyranoside molecule by forming hydrogen bonds and CH-\u03c0 interactions.",

This geometry is compatible with equatorially substituted carbohydrate derivatives. Based on this, the all equatorially n-octyl-\u03b2-D-cellobioside 113 (Figure 36 ) was first used for initial binding studies. Titration 1 H NMR experiments showed a 1:1 binding with a K a of 7.0 \u00d7 10 3 M \u22121 in CDCl 3 /CD 3 OH (92:8), which is higher than that of 108 with \u03b2-monosaccharide (K a = 980 M \u22121 ).

Moreover, weak but unambiguous induced CD was observed when 113 was added to receptor solution in CHCl 3 /MeOH (98:2), although signals were too noisy for quantitative analysis.

Using an NMR titration method with freshly dissolved glucose with an anomeric ratio (\u03b1/\u03b2) of 72:28, a K a of 4.6 M \u22121 was obtained in D 2 O. For glucose equilibrated overnight, which gave an \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio of 40:60, the binding constant was 9.2 M \u22121 . Such results suggest possible selectivity for the \u03b2 anomer. The binding of 118 with other substrates was also studied (Table VII) . The studies with glycosides also show a notable preference for \u03b2-glucose units. For example, the binding affinity for methyl-\u03b2-D-glucoside is 27.3 M \u22121 . In contrast, the binding affinity for methyl-\u03b1-D-glucoside is 6.9 M \u22121 .",

Each pillar involves two amide linkages, with potential to form hydrogen bond with the OH groups in cellobiose. Besides, the pillars were also furnished with externally directed tricarboxylate units to promote solubility. Furthermore, five rigid isophthalamides were also incorporated to prevent the cavity from collapsing. Binding was studied by using an NMR titration method, induced circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy and calorimetry. Ten disaccharides and three monosaccharides were selected as models for selectivity test. Binding constants between receptor 119 and selecting carbohydrates were in the range of 5-910 M \u22121 (Table IX) . The most intriguing result is the excellent selectivity of receptor 119. Minor changes to disaccharide structures could cause almost complete suppression of complex formation. For example, for the result of gentibiose, which contains an all-equatorial structure that is slightly longer than Dcellobiose, the change from D-cellobiose was enough to reduce the binding constant to 12 M \u22121 from 580 M \u22121 . The NOESY contacts observed for the complex between \u03b2-Dcellobiose and receptor 119 and the computational model of the complex gave a good sandwich-like, 2:1 binding model (Figure 39 ). It features eight intermolecular hydrogen bonds and about ten CH-\u03c0 interactions, giving a persuasive explanation for the high binding affinity and selectivity.",

In contrast, lectin binding relies mostly on hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions. The carbohydrate binding sites of lectins are typically a shallow depression on the lectin surface. There are four amino acids that are generally conserved in all lectins regardless of their binding specificity; these are asparagines, aspartic acid, glycine (arginine in Con A) and an aromatic residue. Site-directed mutagenesis in which aspartic acid and asparagines residue is replaced results in loss of the lectin-carbohydrate binding ability. 36 The actual carbohydrate binding site consists of four loops that are typically named A, B, C, and D.399 Aspartic acid is in loop A, glycine in loop B, while asparagines and the aromatic or hydrophobic residue reside in loop C. The amino acids in loop D are highly variable in conformation, length and sequence and have a role to play in the specificity of a lectin. Lectins typically contain a Ca 2+ and a transition metal ion (usually Mn 2+ ). The two cations are 4 \u00c5 apart and are near to the carbohydrate-binding site. These cations are thought to be important in positioning the amino acids residues that interact with the carbohydrate. The correct orientation for the asparagine residue is mediated by a cisoid-peptide bond between the asparagine and the preceding amino acid.343",

The array was then used to analyze the protein ovalbumine that is known to have high mannose and/or hybrid N-linked glycans. 412 The glycopattern observed showed positive signals for the lectins WGA, ConA and GS-II. This was consistent with the known glycosylation pattern for ovalbumine since these three lectins are known to bind to N-linked glycans and ConA to mannose. This pattern is visible to the detection limit of 10 \u03bcg/mL. In order to test the ability of the microarray to differentiate between different glycans, the glycopatterns for ovalbumine was compared to that of two other glycoproteins, bovine submaillary mucin (BSM) and porcine gastric mucin (PGM). The observed pattern for ovalbumine is different from that of BSM or PGM. The observed glycosylation patterns using this nine-lectin array demonstrate its ability to distinguish minimal differences in glycosylation of proteins. This group utilized this same microarray method to monitor cell-surface glycosylation of Escherichia coli. 413 The glycosylation of bacterial cell surfaces has been shown to be important in symbiosis, immunity and cell-cell interaction.144 , 414 However, the limitations of currently available techniques hinder a more detailed examination of the role of glycans in these processes. The method presented by the Mahal group uses a lectin microarray approach to analyze bacterial cell-surface carbohydrates in an efficient manner. The lectin microarray consisted of 21 lectins. Each of the glass slides were printed with 14 isolated subarrays containing five spots per lectin using a SpotBot Arrayer (95 \u03bcM spot size). They examined the binding of fluorescently labeled bacteria (stained by nucleic-acid dye SYTO 85) to the microarray. Significant differences were not observed for the uptake of the dye by different bacterial cell lines; however these strains showed unique binding patterns to the lectin arrays. This observation was especially significant for closely related E. coli strains JM101 and HB101 that could not be distinguished using traditional hemagglutination assays. The two showed reproducible differences in their lectin fingerprints. Both strains showed strong binding to lectins GSII, HPA and WGA, however only JM101 showed moderate binding to MAA and weak binding to BPA, DBA and ECA. They also examined two pathogenic bacteria E. coli RS218 (neonatal meningitis pathogen) and Salmonella tryphimurium LT2. Both of these bacteria showed binding to \u03b1-2, 3-IMAA and \u03b1-2-6-(SNA)-sialic acid residues as well as for \u03b1-1,2-fucose binding as indicated by lectin UEA I. The presence of sialic acids and fucose has been implicated in immune evasion of pathogens.415 RS218 also showed binding to BPA, DBA, ECA and GSI.

The evanescent-field technology is able to analyze relatively weak interactions (such as those between lectins and glycoproteins with K d values in the 10 \u22124 -10 \u22127 M range) because it can detect ongoing interactions under equilibrium conditions in situ without the need to wash after a probing reaction. The evanescent field lectin microarray has been applied to profile glycans of Lec mutants. 419 In this application, cell glycan analysis was performed for Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and their glycan profile was compared to those of their glycosylation-defective Lec mutants. Lec1 (defect in GlcNAc-T1), Lec2 (CMP-sialic acid transporter) and Lec8 (UDP-Gal transporter) were chosen since their biosynthetic features are well characterized. The Lec mutant and CHO cells were grown harvested and washed with PBS to remove any glycoprotein containing ingredient. The cell-surfaces were then labeled with Cy3-succimidyl ester, and a 20 \u03bcL aliquot of each sample was subjected to lectin microarray. The result of the lectin microarray of the CHO cells and the Lec mutants each showed different profiles. Lec1 showed a decrease in signals for a number of lectins such as MAL, ECA, RCA 120, PHS (L), PHA (E), WGA, DSA and LEL and an increase in signals for GNA and HHL. The similarity among the profiles were evaluated using correlation coefficients, that is, a high similarity is indicated by a correlation coefficient higher than 0.9 and a low similarity if the coefficient is lower than 0.5. Keeping these coefficient limits in mind, the resemblance of CHO and Lec1 cells is relatively low with a correlation coefficient of 0.57 whereas Lec2 is relatively similar with a coefficient of 0.81. Lec8 showed the biggest difference among the Lec mutants with a coefficient of 0.46. Lec 8 showed significant decreases in signal for MAL, ECA, RCA120, ACL and PHA (E) which recognize non-reducing terminal sialic acid or galactose. In addition, the Lec 8 mutant showed increased binding with WFA, ABA, EEL, NPA and SBA lectins. These results were compared to results from flow cytometric analysis and glycosidase digestion with neuraminidase. For the latter technique the cells were washed extensively after treatment with neuraminidase and before Cy3 labeling, resulting in a substantial change in glycan profile for CHO cells. On the other hand, no difference were observed for any of the three Lec mutants which can be explained by the fact that Lec mutants do not have sialic acid and are not affected by neuraminidase treatment.",

In this method, glycoanalysis is performed on intact glycoproteins that require about 4-6 hours in most cases. The major advantage of this kit over other methods is that it uses a set of proprietary algorithms that can provide analysis of the resulting histogram with the click of a mouse.420 The technology consists of arrays of 24 plant lectins with overlapping specificities. Binding of a glycoprotein to the array results in a characteristic fingerprint of glycan composition of the protein. The use of such a large number of lectins ensures a high sensitivity to changes in glycosylation pattern. The lectins were spotted in duplicate arrays on nitrocellulose membrane-coated glass slides with 6 replicate sports each and the array was then incubated with intact glycoprotein. The arrays are scanned and the resulting images are analyzed using propriety image analysis software that converts the images into a fingerprint, that is, a histogram of the signal obtained for each lectin. The robust average of the signals is obtained from the 6 replicates and the fingerprint is interpreted by proprietary knowledge-based algorithms. The algorithm creates a list of epitopes with their relative abundance. To develop the algorithm, the specificity of lectins was determined by studying their binding to a large collection of carefully characterized glycoproteins. The glycoproteins in which literature information was not available were fully characterized by mass spectrometric and chromatographic methods. From this information, thousands of fingerprints were created of several hundred glycoform mixtures and resulted in detailed specificity definitions for many lectins. The performance of this microarray analysis kit was demonstrated by the analysis of a series of glycoproteins and their glycovariants. For example, the glycoprofile of a well-studied protein bovine pancreatic ribonuclease B (RNase B) was examined that contains a single N-linked glycosylation site at Asn34 and also contains high-mannose-type-N-linked glycans. Glycoanalysis of RNase B showed the presence of high levels of high-mannose type Nlinked glycans only, which is in agreement with literature data. Strong signals were observed for Glc/Man-and Man-recognizing lectins and essentially no signals for complex-type and antenna-termini-recognizing lectins. The glyco-array kits method also stayed consistent to literature data in the analysis of prostate-specific antigen, porcine thyroglobulin, Tamm Horsfall glycoprotein and recombinant human erythropoietin. This method has been provided as a useful tool for glycobiologists for more detailed analyses and characterization of their proteins of interest.",

Since carbohydrates are the most abundant modification in cells and lectins have the ability to bind to and recognize terminal sugar residues, they provide a means to introduce small drug molecules into cells. A comprehensive review of lectins in drug delivery has been presented by Woodley and co-workers. 428 Glycotargeting with lectins is exemplified by the potential use of lectins as anti-HIV therapies.",

            "text": "The increased risk and fatalities associated with viral diseases such as hepatitis C and HIV-1 demands the development of novel anti-viral treatments, especially since current therapies have only limited success. Carbohydrates on viral envelopes play an important role in viral entry into the cells. Therefore, if an agent can bind to these glycans it may interrupt the function of the virus. Many such avenues have been explored in which lectins are used to develop anti-HIV therapy. The infection of cells by HIV-1 requires the fusion of the viral membrane with cellular membranes. This fusion is mediated by viral envelope proteins such as gp120 and gp41 along with cell surface receptors (CD4 and chemokine receptor) on the target cells 429. Therefore, the viral envelope proteins are attractive targets for anti-HIV-1 therapy. Agents that interact with the viral envelope may interfere with the entry into target cells. The binding of lectins to the glycans on the viral envelope may also force the virus to delete a portion of its glycans shield, making the virus more susceptible to attack. 102 Several lectins had been isolated, identified and studied for anti-HIV activity. Cyanovirin (CV-N) is a 11kDa protein with 101 amino acids. It is isolated from the cyano bacterium Nostoc ellisposporum430 and has affinity for high-mannose glycans especially\u03b1-(1,2)-linked mannose oligomers.431 , 432 CV-N inactivates T-lymphocyte-tropic, laboratory strains of HIV type 1 and HIV type 2, as well as T-tropic, M-tropic and dual tropic primary clinical isolates of HIV-1. The anti-HIV activity of CV-N is related, in some part, to its binding to envelope protein gp120. As a result, it prevents in vitro fusion and transmission of HIV-1 between infected and uninfected cells. Continuous treatment of uninfected CEM-SS cells in the presence of high concentrations (9000 nM) of CV-N did attenuate the lethal effect of the virus. CV-N had an anti-HIV activity in CEM-SS cells with an EC50 of 0.1 nM. SVN (scytovirm) is a 9.7kDa peptide with 95 amino acids and has been shown to have affinity for \u03b1(1,2)-\u03b1(1,6)-mannose trisaccharide units. SVN inhibit HIV infection in T-tropic laboratory strain HIV-1 in CEM-SS cells with an EC 50 of 0.3 nM.433 According to ELISA studies performed, the anti HIV activity is related to its binding to the glycosylated viral core proteins gp120, gp160 and to a lesser extent gp41. However, SVN did not bind to the CD4 receptor. Additional experiments also showed that SVN had to be present in the first eight hours of virus infection for it to be effective. Also pretreatment and removal of SVN led to normal HIV infection in uninfected CEM-SS cells. Altogether these studies suggest that SVN interferes with binding/fusion mechanism of the virus.",

            "text": "Carbohydrates are known to play important roles in a large number of biological and pathological processes. Therefore, high affinity and specificity \"binders\" for biologically important carbohydrates are potential medicinal and diagnostic agents. They can also be important research tools. The use of lectins in various applications has shown some initial promise. Progress in recent years in boronic acid-based carbohydrate binders (boronolectins), non-covalent binders, and metal-based binders have laid an excellent foundation for the future development of medicinal and diagnostic agents based on carbohydrate recognition. Especially important and new are ways of making peptide-based boronolectins and nucleic acid-based boronolectins, which give tremendous modularity and structural diversity for a wide range of application. The use of boronic acid-modified DNA aptamers for glycoproteins with the ability to differentiate glycoforms represents a very significant progress in glycoprotein detections. However, it is also true that peptide-and nucleic acid-based boronolectins may only be useful for in vitro applications and for targeting of cell surface biomarkers because of their potential membrane permeability problems. In this regard, small molecule lectin mimics including boronolectins continue to hold an advantage for intracellular applications. Because of the need for carbohydrate \"binders\" for a wide range of applications including concentration determination, cellsurface labeling, as diagnostic agents, delivery of imaging agents to cell surface, binding to cell surface carbohydrates involved in pathological events (such as metastasis) for therapeutic applications, and intracellular recognition and labeling, all the different methods of developing carbohydrate \"binders\" discussed will be very useful. We hope with this review, we can pursued more people in the carbohydrate sensing field to work on problems directly related to therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

Strongin and co-workers reported several stereoselective and regioselective boronic acid chemosensors (Figure 9 and 10) such as 30, 31 and 32.189 One example is the xanthene dye-based chemosensor 30, which fluoresces at a long wavelength, 597 nm (\u03bbex: 565 nm), and showed good selectivity for ribose (K a = 2400 M \u22121 ) comparing to fructose (110 M \u22121 ), galactose (310 M \u22121 ), and glucose (200 M \u22121 ).

Crystallographic studies have also been conducted. The results show that binding involves both hydrogen bond CH-\u03c0 and van der Waals interactions. Receptor 60 showed similar binding affinity for both anomers with a binding constant of 1.4 \u00d7 10 4 M \u22121 for 63 and 1.3 \u00d7 10 4 M \u22121 for 64.",

Furthermore, compound 86 shows similar binding affinity as compound 87 despite the fact that it does not have the functional groups for ionic interactions. However, both receptors, 86 and 87, showed dramatically decreased association constants in aqueous solution. For example, compound 87 has K a1 of 2 M \u22121 and K a2 of 72 M \u22121 with 63 in water. One surprising thing is that compound 87 showed a preference for the disaccharide D-cellobiose with K a1 of 305 M \u22121 and K a2 of 66 M \u22121 in CDCl 3 .",

The results showed about 10-fold higher affinity for 63 than its precursor 78 (K a1 = 1.3 \u00d7 10 3 M \u22121 ) without the crown ether group. Besides, the two receptors both showed good selectivity for 63 over 64. For example, receptor 88 has a ratio of 417/1 for binding with 63 over 64. Although the incorporation of crown ether group could enhance the binding affinity, such results were only obtained in CDCl 3 solution.
