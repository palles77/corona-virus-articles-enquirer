Health threats from the humananimal-ecosystems interface (HAEI) and zoonotic diseases (zoonoses) impose an increasing risk continuously to public health, from those emerging pathogens transmitted through contact with animals, food, water and contaminated environments. Immense challenges forced on the ecological perspectives on food and the eco-environments, including aquaculture, agriculture and the entire food systems. Impacts of food and eco-environments on human health will be examined amongst the importance of human interventions for intended purposes in lowering the adverse effects on the biodiversity. The complexity of relevant conditions defined as factors contributing to the ecological determinants of health will be illuminated from different perspectives based on concepts, citations, examples and models, in conjunction with harmful consequential effects of human-induced disturbances to our environments and food systems, together with the burdens from ecosystem disruption, environmental hazards and loss of ecosystem functions.

            "text": "Concepts of diseases are developed at different stages throughout the history of public health developments. The basic premise of ecological thinking is that human health and their determinants are interrelated, and different determinants of health are leading to different patterns in the burdens of diseases. The world is constantly changing and different approaches for public health have also been adjusted to accommodate the transitional needs of the situations from the conversion of an old public health model to a new public health model, and till recently, an ecological public health model is the ultimate focus of this transitional needs for an attempt to make positive movements and actions to counter these multiple influences of our health arising from those of ecological determinants. WHO (1947) defined that BHealth is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity.^However, this definition of health has received much criticism over the years and considered to be inadequate to capture variations in health, as health is dynamic and changes from time to time and with multiple dimensions (Sharma and Atri 2010) . In fact, many literatures also revealed different dimensions for the health concept in areas such as physical health, mental health, social health, environmental health, spiritual health and emotional health (Ananth 2008) . Concepts of health are indeed defined in much broader sense, especially there are different meanings of focuses that set forth the boundaries in its field of concerns in relation to the particular health issues and/or determinants per se. This paper discusses more focuses on expanding the boundary in the concepts of health with emergence of complicated factors involved as our understandings developed through the correlations of these complex systems towards the twenty-first century in ecological public health developments, regarding the ecological determinants of health in conjunction with the harmful consequential effects of humaninduced disturbances to our environments and food systems, together with the burdens from ecosystem disruption, environmental hazards and loss of ecosystem functions.",

Public health refers to Ball organized measures (whether public or private) to prevent disease, promote health, and prolong life among the population as a whole. Its activities aim to provide conditions in which people can be healthy and focus on entire populations, not on individual patients of diseases. Thus, public health is concerned with the total system and not only the eradication of a particular disease^ (WHO 2015a) . Transforming from the perspectives of old public health model that focused on hygiene, sanitation, clean water and housing to a new public health model that shifted to person-in-action directly towards health with emphasis on lifestyle approach, which is also in line with the governmental policies of Bbetter health for all^as an initiative, in which the prime focuses are on the lifestyle dimension as an integral part in its concept for health, and till now in the ecological public health concern in the direction of momentous demands and focuses to support the sustainability of our eco-environments and human communities for our ongoing existence on this planet earth, inter alia with issues on global environmental hazards to human health such as climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, loss of biodiversity, changes in hydrological systems and the supplies of freshwater, land degradation and stresses on food-producing systems, as well as other ecological determinants such as health threats from the humananimal-ecosystems interface (HAEI) and zoonotic diseases (zoonoses). Host-agent-environment model is an early public health framework that has also been viewed as adhering to this ecological standpoint, in which eco-epidemiology is grounded in the principle of ecologism with emphasis on the concept of disease resulting from complex interactions between man, an agent (e.g. domestic food animals, poultry and wildlife) and the environments.",

This is especially so, as our understandings unfolded on the complexes of factors that interacted and interrelated to the effects of our human health under the influences of these ecological determinants, which are beyond our systems thinking yet is also systemic in a web of relationships, and all of which are also undergoing change to different health transitions (Rayner and Lang 2012) . This understanding of healthdisease process from different perspectives and stages across public health developments in terms of the patterns in health transition, in turn, is an integral part of evidences supporting this paradigm shift. This paper specifically illustrates the importance of this ecological paradigm, and those actual and potential health threats from the HAEI and zoonoses impose an increasing risk continuously to public health, from those emerging pathogens transmitted through contact with animals, food, water and contaminated environments that arise from such existence of ecological determinants under this shift. This paradigm shift is focused on BOne Health^vision and BOne World^concept as generated for the Ecological Public Health Model in order to promote ecological harmony and preserve the eco-environments for our co-existence of healthy ecosystems, healthy animals and healthy humans. As Rayner and Lang (2012, p. 12) reckoned that BA new ecological sense of public health is emerging based on the recognition of the limits on nature, that nature no longer offers an endless cornucopia of its resources for human use or that the biological world can be ceaselessly altered to human advantage^. Therefore, it is important to understand those ecological factors such as effects of ecosystem services, environmental hazards and its related impacts on the eco-environments and food systems to our human health, plus health threats being strained by HAEI. The ultimate goals of ecological public health approach served as the proactive interventions to counter or minimize those actual and potential problems.",

Food and environment served as a key connecting point to the challenges in this domain, as WHO (2014a) indicated that HAEI and zoonotic diseases (zoonoses) are common to man and animals, which have been recognized for many centuries. The complexity of factors and issues arising from food systems and environments in relation to the ecological determinants of health is indeed focused on more holistic spectrums of all those inducing factors rather than just the causes confined in the disease-centred biomedical model. Ecosystem refers to the combined physical and biological components of an environment, with a dynamic complex of plant, animal and microorganism communities and their nonliving environment interacting as a functional unit. These organisms form complex sets of interrelationships and functions in our planet earth and any of ecosystem disruption can have adverse impact on our health in various ways through complex pathways. Friis (2012) stated that physical and social environments play major roles in the health of individuals and communities and also further emphasized maintaining environmental quality is a pressing task for the twenty-first century. The concept of environmental hazards can be in the form of biological, chemical, physical, psychological and sociological or site and location hazards, which are harmful to our human health, and those hazards can also be affected by the changes or disturbances of biodiversity and its subsequent ecosystem services (Romanelli et al. 2014) . Every disturbance to the eco-environment will prime to the subsequent alteration of disease patterns and our human exposure to the altered and later disease outbreaks that in effect guide to the increasing burdens on global health (Barrett et al. 2015) .",

In fact, environmental impacts are an important factor in the interaction of agent and host under this epidemiological or ecological triad. Traditionally, the concerns of environmental epidemiology included the contamination of air, water and food. Nowadays, the focus is expanding to include predisposing factors such as climate change and other large-scale environmental impacts related to globalization and urbanization, with which also imposed a significant number of adverse health outcomes from those anthropogenic activities, for instance, as Barrett et al.

(2013) . Lake et al. (2012) also further illustrated any such altered conditions for food production may result in emerging pathogens into new crop and livestock species, as well as the altered use of pesticides and veterinary medicines that also affect the main transfer mechanisms through which contaminants can move from the environment into food. Therefore, any extensive use of antimicrobials in all sectors, for human, agriculture, aquaculture and horticulture, means these drugs are often also found in the environment, especially in waterways and soils (Mackenzie et al. 2013) . In reality, such uses of antibiotics in animals have been over the years and also resulted in a selective pressure for AMR microorganisms, which are contributing significantly to our human health problems as people, animals and the environment are directly and indirectly interconnected (Mackenzie et al. 2013) . In this Fig. 1 Emergence of zoonoses (Bean et al. 2013) context, it means that none of the things that the people put into the ecosystem simply disappears, but in actual fact, what we do to this eco-environment, we do to ourselves, because pollutants reach humans through the food we eat and the water we drink as well as the air we breathe. Food and environment on our human health is always a complex issue with many factors interacting and relating to each other as indicated all the way through air pollutions, water pollutions, misuse of antibiotics and growth hormones, over-fishing, abuse of chemical usages, food fraud and overlook of food animals and poultry welfares, as well as other determinants of environmental contaminants, climate changes and food-producing systems, etc.",

For instance, scientists suggest that a virus passed from hogs to humans may have caused the 1918 BSpanish Influenza^pandemic, which caused acute illness in 25-30 % of the world's population and eventually killed 40 million people worldwide (Taubenberger 2006) . Vandegrift et al. (2010) affirmed that influenza virus transmission in wild and domestic animals and humans is intimately connected, and anthropogenic change such as human population growth, land use, climate change, globalization of trade and agricultural intensification is continuously affecting the ecological and evolutionary determinants of transmissibility of such virulence in birds and humans, which can in turn impose potential for subsequent spread of pandemic, as evidence suggested viral transmission in domestic poultry, spillover to other domestic animals, wild birds and humans. Furthermore, the high rates of growth, substantial genetic selection for improved growth and feed conversion on poultry breeds that resulted in reduced genetic diversity of domestic poultry would also enhance the potential epidemic transmission and evolution of influenza viruses (Vandegrift et al. 2010) .",

Those climate changes subsequently imposed adverse effects significantly affecting ecosystem health, water supplies and food production (Yeh, et al. 2015; Brown and DeGaetano 2011) . For instance, as according to Weller et al. (2015) , the global rice agriculture will also be increasingly challenged by water scarcity. Other food production problems are the increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and/or hazards of heavy metals in agricultural systems that could lower the content of zinc and other nutrients in important food crops, and in effect, zinc deficiency is currently responsible for large burdens of disease globally, and the populations who are at the highest risk of zinc deficiency (Myers et al. 2015; Savic et al. 2015) . The dietary deficiencies of zinc and iron are a substantial global public health problem, with an estimated two billion people suffering from these deficiencies, causing a loss of 63 million life-years annually, due to crops grown under field conditions at the elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentration (Myers et al. 2014) . Moreover, environmental contaminants such as heavy metals can also endanger and decrease the ecological value of surrounding water and agricultural land resources by exposing food production to potential contaminants with complex pollution sources (Savic et al. 2015) .",

Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy; while optimizing natural and human resources^ (Burlingame et al. 2010 p. 7) . IOM (2014) also projected a series of major workshops with themes on BSustainable Diets: Food for Healthy People and a Healthy Planet^, which also described how different diets have different environmental impacts with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and the use and contamination of air, water and other natural resources. The concept of sustainable diets offers an opportunity for the commitments to sustainable development to the need for improving the quality and environmental sustainability of our food system, especially given the alarming pace of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation (Johnston et al. 2014) . For instance, the Mediterranean diet has become the object of increasing studies on its environmental sustainability, because of its mainly plant-based dietary pattern and its lower greenhouse gas emissions and lower water footprints, energy resources and the overall impact on the ecosystem (Dernini and Berry 2015) . In fact, this is also in line with our One World concept under Ecological Public Health Model as illustrated in this paper, for sustaining our environment and the planet earth for all beings, as also echoing to Confucian's theory for the environmental ethics of ecological harmony. In fact, lack of ecological health literacy and eco-environmental ethics in practices is one of the most important factors leading to the present devastations and worries.",

A critical example is a developing model of infectious disease that shows most epidemics, as mentioned in previous sections regarding health threats under the impacts of the ecological triad. Susser and Susser (1996) stated that eco-epidemiology is a perspective that balances traditional biomedical concepts of risk with the broader social and environmental context and community ownership principles; in this way, eco-epidemiology rests on an understanding of a universe in which Bnothing exists as a thing by itself, but only has existence in relation to everything else^. Such as forest filter the water we drink, and birds and bees pollinate crops, both of which have substantial economic as well as biological value.",

In 2008, FAO, World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), WHO, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank, and UN System Influenza Coordination (FAO et al. 2008) have developed a strategy to address emerging infectious diseases that specifically focused on the interdependence of human, animal and ecosystem health, with strategic framework of breaking down the barriers among agencies, individuals, specialties and sectors in order to unleash the innovation and expertise needed to meet the many serious challenges to the health of people, domestic animals and wildlife as well as to the integrity of ecosystems. Rayner and Lang (2012) postulated a broader conception in the Bthinking^focus of the environment with recognition that human activity was altering nature and that humans depend on that environment, not least through food, but also the realization of the impact of climate change, biodiversity loss and global interconnectedness as the challenge under an era of ecological threat.",

In this regard, a broader understanding of health and disease requires interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral efforts working collaboratively to attain optimal health for people, animals and our environments for ensuring the biological and biophysical integrity of our planet earth. Consequently, the recognitions of these relationships amongst humans, domestic animals, wildlife, ecosystem services and climate, as in the BOne health concept\u00fb nder Becosphere and zoosphere^of this one world system, are therefore being formulated. A better understanding of the links between biodiversity, health and disease has direct and indirect implications for public health, as loss of biodiversity, habitat fragmentation and the loss of natural environments threaten the full range of life-supporting services provided by ecosystems at all levels of biodiversity, including species, genetic and ecosystem diversity (Romanelli et al. 2014) . The diversity of relevant criteria defined around the public health interventions will be placed on in using One Health approach with this One World concept; FAO/OIE/WHO (2012) built the One Health vision in support of the collaborative multidisciplinary work for the health of humans, animals and ecosystems, in order to reduce the risk of diseases at the interfaces between them. Its critical vision facilitate the diffusion and understandings towards collaborative intervention keys with broad vision to encompass other disciplines that also impact human health from different sectors such as economics, food security and food safety.

Eco-aquaculture is an alternative model linked between aquaculture, the environment and society that acted as complementary roles of aquaculture in allowing the time for our eco-environment recovery (Costa-Pierce 2010). 2. Efforts from the regulatory use of antimicrobial agents are needed in order to prevent development and spread of antimicrobial resistance in aquaculture and to reduce the risk to our human health. There has been much debate about the origins of AMR. Nevertheless, linkages between misuse and increasing AMR are of our concerns. FAO/OIE/WHO (2012) indicated that the accelerated emergence of resistance and the discovery and development of new antimicrobial drugs have slowed to the extent that the development of AMR is now exceeding the availability of new antimicrobial agents, making AMR a global threat to our health. 3. Reduction on food waste to minimize the adverse cycle on the environmental problems by landfills, which cause pollution and produce methane that is a harsh greenhouse gas emission with adverse effects to our eco-environments (Kosseva and Webb 2013) . For example, food wastes in Hong Kong were from less than 400 tonnes per day in 2002 to over 800 tonnes per day in 2012, and the landfill problems with excess food wastes are the major constituent of the municipal solid waste; despite the food waste is highly degradable, it can easily cause odour and hygiene problems that pose risk to our health as well as an adverse cycle by depleting the limited landfill space in HK (HKEPD 2015). 4. Promotion of ecological health literacy and environmental ethics to the public via public health interventions and education in order to provide the public with knowledge to understand this emerging concerns is utmost vital in terms of the consequences of human actions and interactions amongst humans, animals and wildlife within the natural context of the eco-environments and its functions to our planet earth's ecosystems. A matter of education to promote the environmental ethics and way of living with concept of sustainable diets, as well as providing education and training programmes to create more ecologists as a potential workforce, should also be the prime focus, as Kosseva and Webb (2013) supported that these are critical for ecoinnovation for our human capital needs in the delivery of the eco-innovative solutions to our concern.",

These prior and vital definitions of ecological health literacy further strengthen up our belief and practice to our everyday life choices that could well be derived from our understandings of such ecological webs and then form our Bsense of place^in relation to, yet again, our everyday life choices. Reynolds et al. (2009) suggested that every people should be equipped with this ecological health literacy, with connections that ripple out over the globe and to the future generations being actually the foundations of a sustainable society. Bousfield and Brown (2011) emphasized on the One Health idea as a paradigm shift in the way we think about human and animal health in the world, and they further describe this paradigm shift is a revolution and a transformation or a metamorphosis with a complex set of multifactorial circumstances such as population growth, changes in nutritional, agricultural and trade practices, globalization, the shifts in land use, accelerated urbanization, deforestation, encroachment on wildlife and climate change. Their insights and visionaries are not about one disease or a few main listed diseases, but rather concern all human and animal diseases under all related ecologies, as The American Veterinary Medical Association (2008) also supported the concept of One Health should be the collaborative effort of multiple disciplines in order to attain optimal health for people, animals and the environment. Romanelli et al. (2014) also reinforced the links amongst ecosystem services, biodiversity and global health are multifaceted and complex and are manifested at various spatial and temporal scales; hence, ecosystem approaches are absolutely relevant to One Health concept, which embrace the interconnectedness of people (and human development), wildlife and ecosystems to improve global health outcomes. In America, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2004) have offered guidelines as referred to in the BManhattan Principlest o build the bridges to our health in this BGlobalized World^, which summarized the importance of focuses from the perspectives of holistic approach for the prevention of an epidemic/epizootic disease and the maintenance of ecosystem integrity. Global health is the contemporary public health movement for the twenty-first century public health and that should be shifted into an ecological paradigm with ecological and ethical thinking for the concerns of eco-health in support of the sustainability of our environments and our planet earth for all plant, animal and human health.",
