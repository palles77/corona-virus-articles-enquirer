No source of bleeding was identified by colonoscopy or abdominal CT scan and as such, we considered the possibility that hematochezia might be secondary to infection with SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. Unfortunately, we did not determine whether SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in stool specimens, which may have provided further direct evidence in this case.
