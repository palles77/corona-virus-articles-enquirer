Hemagglutinin protein is a major membrane protein of the vital molecular factor in CDV tropism, also known to induce hosts to produce neutralizing antibodies. In the current study, we prepared two monoclonal antibodies, 1A5 and 2B8, against the H protein of the CDV-PS strain. A series of partially overlapping synthetic peptides covering the hemagglutinin protein (amino acids 50-204) were screened to define the linear epitope identified by 1A5 and 2B8 mAbs. 120 QKTNFFNPNREFDFR 134 (F8) and 178 ARGDIFPPY 186 (F14-1) are minimal linear epitopes recognized by 1A5 and 2B8 mAbs, respectively. Further investigations revealed that F8 is conserved in different CDV strains; however, F14-1 contains mutant residues 178, 179, and 180. The epitopes F8 and F14-1 localized at the surface of hemagglutinin protein in a three-dimensional (3D) structure. CDV-infected dog serum can also recognize the identified B-cell epitopes.",

The disease is characterized by high fever, diarrhea, encephalitis, immunosuppression, and other symptoms. The high mortality and morbidity of dogs and fur animals result in serious economic losses. The emergence of canine distemper has been continuously reported in China (3) . Therefore, controlling the spread of CDV still faces enormous challenges. CDV is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded negative RNA virus with a genome size of \u223c15.7 kb. The genome encodes nucleocapsid protein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin protein (H), and large protein (L). The CDV envelope consists of two integral glycoproteins, fusion protein (F) and hemagglutinin protein (H) (4) . The H gene contains 1,947 nucleotides, encoding 607 amino acids. The size of CDV H protein is \u223c78 kD. Embedded on the surface of the viral envelope, H protein can effectively induce the body to produce neutralizing antibodies and play an important role in antigenic recognition (5) . Recently, many studies reported the application of H protein in vaccines and diagnosis (6, 7) . The antigenic epitopes of CDV hemagglutinin protein have not been investigated clearly.",

Two monoclonal antibodies, named 1A5 and 2B8, were previously constructed and stored in the lab. These two monoclonal antibodies were produced by immunizing mice with recombinant truncated CDV-PS strain H protein. The plasmid pEasy-H protein aa 1-204 was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells (Takara) for protein expression ( Figure S1 ). According to standard procedures, truncated H protein (1-204 aa) was used as the antigen to immunize mice to produce CDV H-specific mAb (8) . CDV-PS (GenBank accession number: JN896331.1), CDV-Rockborn (GenBank accession number: GU810819.1), and CDV3 (GenBank accession number: EU726268.1) were used for cell inoculation in immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and WB tests. To determine the virus titers, cells cultivated in 96well plates were inoculated with 10-fold serial dilutions of the virus and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 3-5 days. The viral titers were estimated with the Reed and Muench method and expressed as the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 )/ml. The multiplicity of infection (MOI = 0.1) was confirmed according to the virus titer of the Vero cells. Dog serum samples collected from pet hospitals were confirmed to be CDV positive or negative by using colloidal gold immunochromatography test strips.",

A series of studies have performed linear B-cell epitope mapping of CDV using monoclonal antibodies against N and P proteins (13, 14) . And the antigenic differences between vaccine strains and wild-type strains have been reported. Due to antigenic differences between the vaccine strains and the currently circulating wildtype strains, current vaccines may provide incomplete protection (15) .

Furthermore, mAb 1A5 specifically binds epitopes with the exact core unit F14-1, and mAb 2B8 recognizes F8. Here the epitope 120 QKTNFFNPNREFDFR 134 was found to be conserved in different genotypes of CDV ( Figure 3B) . The IFA and WB test confirmed the sequence alignment results. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that 178 ARGDIFPPY 186 was conserved among most Asian-1 CDVs except CDV RD-JL ( Figure 3A) . So the specific mAb 1A5 can be used as a tool to differentiate CDV RD-JL from other CDV Asia-1 strains. The results of western blotting and conservation analysis of the epitopes demonstrated that the monoclonal antibody lost its characteristics when Ala became Gly at 178 and Gly became Ser at 180. The residues 178 and 180 may be the key determinants of F14-1 reactivity. Previous research indicated that the length of an epitope is usually 5 to 7 amino acids or does not exceed 20 amino acids (16) . In this study, the minimal linearized epitopes were 9 and 15 amino acids, which are consistent with the results obtained in the previous study. In addition, we used peptides of identified epitopes to verify the reactivity of CDV-positive dog serum. The result demonstrated that CDV-positive dog serum was able to recognize the identified B-cell epitopes.",

The mAbs are labeled at the right under each panel. (B) The mAbs recognized CDV-infected Vero cells by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The cells were uninfected and infected with CDV. After 36 h, the cells were primed with 1A5 and 2B8. (C) Binding affinities of the mAb 1A5 and mAb 2B8 determined by indirect ELISA with CDV-PS strain. The value of OD 450 nm is shown as a function of the respective dilution ratios of mAbs. The negative control used mAb against canine parvovirus.",
