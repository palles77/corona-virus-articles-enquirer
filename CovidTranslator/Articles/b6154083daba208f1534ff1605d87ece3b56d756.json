Therefore, there is a dire need to find alternative treatment options for this disease. Since ancient times, medicinal plants are widely used to cure various diseases with no or less harmful effects. Therefore, this study was designed to find out phytochemicals and investigate antiviral activity of methanol extract of Ajuga bracteosa, Ajuga parviflora, Berberis lycium and Citrus lemon against Hepatitis C Virus (HCV infection). Phytochemical analysis of the plant extract was performed using various chemical tests. Toxicity of the plant extract was determined against using trypan blue exclusion method. Antiviral activity of the selected plant extract was find out against HCV infected HepG2 cells. For this purpose, HepG2 cells were seeded with HCV positive and negative serum and nontoxic doses of plant extract for 24 and 48 h. After this RNA was extracted and viral load was determined using Real-time PCR. Phytochemical analysis showed the presence of flavonoids and phenols in all plant extracts while amino acids, alkaloids and tannins were present in B. lycium and saponins were detected in C. lemon. Toxicity assay showed that all plant extracts were nontoxic at maximum concentration of 200 \u03bcg/ml except B. lycium, which showed mild toxicity at 40 \u03bcg/ml and were extremely toxic at 60 \u03bcg/ml and above doses. Real-time PCR quantitation result revealed that after 24 h treatments A. parviflora showed highest antiviral activity, followed by A. bracteosa, while B. lycium extract had low (35%) and C. lemon has no antiviral effects. The 48 h treatments showed an increase antiviral activity by A. bracteosa followed by A. parviflora and B. lycium while C. lemon showed negative effect. Our results depicted that mentioned plants might be used as an alternative therapeutic regime or in combination with existing treatments against HCV.",

A. bracteosa is native to the hilly areas of Pakistan, China, India and Malaysia. In Pakistan, it is found in the northern hilly areas locally known as trakha boti (bitter herb). It has many ethnopharmacological uses as its leaves been used to make herbal medicine to cure diabetes, malaria and digestion related problems [2] . Moreover, leaves extract has been traditionally used to remove toxicity from the blood. The root extract has also been used for the curing of digestion related issues [3] . A. parviflora is found in Pakistan, Kashmir, and Afghanistan within the low temperature and hilly https [4] . It was reported that this plant has been traditionally used to cure fever, asthma, HCV, jaundice [5] , arthritis, cancer and wounds [6] . This plant also has been used in the treatment of eye irritation, poisoning from insect attack, stomach pain and liver tissue damage [7] . Berberis lycium (B. lycium) naturally grow in all regions of Himalayas and also found in temperate and semi temperate regions of Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and India. In Pakistan, they were found in the area which lies between 900 and 2900 m like Azad Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Baluchistan. It is used to cure disease like liver disorders, abdominal pain, skin diseases, cough and ophthalmic. Citrus lemon (C. lemon) comes under the family rutaceae and grown all over the world. It has been used against cancer, to reduce the cytotoxicity of low density lipoprotein and to prevent edema of the legs.",

HCV is present in chronic form in around 130-150 million peoples around the world and are responsible of 33% death alone as a member of hepatitis group [8] . In Pakistan, HCV sero-prevalence among the general adult population is 6.8%, while active HCV infection was found in approximately 6% of the population [9] . Currently, the most common treatment for HCV is the combination of ribavirin and pegylated interferon\u03b1. This treatment is given for 24-48 weeks depending on viral genotype and races [10] . The long term uses of this treatment produces severe side effects including transient virologic response, hemolytic anemia and teratogenic effects [11, 12] . Hence, it is needed to find new and alternative ways of treatment for HCV with lower side effects and higher efficacy.",

Plants were identified by Dr. Abdul Nazir, plant taxonomist at Department of Environmental Sciences, COMSATS Institute of information technology Abbottabad, Pakistan and the voucher specimen was placed in Islamabad herbarium at Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad. The plants were washed with tap water and dried at room temperature in the shade. At 8-12% moisture level, the plant materials were grounded and weighted. Then, extraction was performed using previously reported method with some modifications [13] . Briefly, 100 gm of each plant material was soaked in 750 ml of 70% methanol for 10 days. The mixture was filtered using a mousseline cloth in order to remove large waste particles of the plant, followed by filtration with Whatman Filter Paper 42. The extract was concentrated using a rotatory evaporator at 50\u00b0C. The dried samples were weighted and stored. Stock were prepared by dissolving 20 mg of extract in 1 ml of Dimethyl sulfoxide and kept at -20\u00b0C for further use.",

In which the 3 ml of extracts were separately dissolved in 70% HCl and filtered. Then, Mayer's reagent was added to the filtrates and appearance of yellow color precipitate indicated the presence of alkaloids. Fehling's test was used for the detection of carbohydrates. In this, 0.5 g extracts were dissolved in 5 ml of distilled water and filtered. Then, the filtrates were hydrolyzed with 70% HCl, neutralized with alkali and at last heated with Fehling's A and B solutions. The presence of reducing sugars was indicated by the formation of red precipitate. For the detection of saponins, Foam test was applied in which 0.5 gm of extract was dissolved in 2 ml of distilled water and well shaken. The production of foam, and its persistence up to 10 min indicated the presence of saponins. Phenols were detected with Ferric Chloride test in which 2 ml of extracts were treated with 2-3 drops of 10% ferric chloride solution. Formation of bluish black color indicated the presence of phenols. Tannins were detected with Gelatin test. It was performed by adding 1% gelatin solution containing sodium chloride to the extract. The presence of tannins was indicated by the formation of white precipitate. For the detection of flavonoids (Lead Acetate test), 2 ml of extracts were treated with 2-3 drops of lead acetate solution. Formation of yellow color precipitate indicated the presence of flavonoids. Ninhydrin test was used for the detection of amino acids. Ninhydrin solution was added to the extract and boiled for a few min. The formation of blue color indicated the presence of amino acids.",

Methanol extract from the leaves of A. bracteosa, A. parviflora, roots of B. lycium and from the pulp of C. lemon were checked for their anti-HCV activity. It is always important to know the phytoconstituents of extracts under investigation. Therefore, plants were subjected to phytochemical analysis. The plants under study were also previously analyzed by researchers for phytoconstituents. They had reported that A. bracteosa methanol extract is a promising bioactive extract due to presence of polyphenols and phytoecdysteroids. Kayani et al. [18] . The results in current study agreed as phenols were detected (Table 3) . Similarly, previous study reported the presence of aromatic compounds, carbohydrates, glycosides, tannins, alkaloids, polyphenols, quinines and dions, aminophenols, steroids/sterols, flavonoids and terpenoids in A. Parviflora methanol extract. In the present study flavonoids, carbohydrates, amino acids and phenols were detected, however alkaloids were not detected ( Table 3 ). The reason for absence of alkaloids could be the difference in season of collection or age of the collected plants in the present and previous study. Likewise, the presence of flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, carbohydrates was reported in B. lycium [19] . All these constituents were also present in the currently investigated extract (Table 3 ). In a previous study, the phytochemical analysis of citrus juice concentrates revealed the presence of flavonoids and saponins which are detected in the current study [20] .",
