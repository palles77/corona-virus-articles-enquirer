All 21 close contacts of RP patients were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and no suspicious clinical symptoms were reported. However, 18/24 of RNA-negative samples detected by the commercial kit were tested to be positive for virus RNA using a hyper-sensitive method, suggesting the carrier status of virus possibly existed in patients recovered from COVID-19.",

Mild RP patients were usually younger than 14 years old and moderate RP patients were younger than 60 years old. By contrast, no severe patients were found to be RP patients within the similar follow-up period. In addition, more RP patients displayed minor symptoms in their hospitalization such as less comorbidities and fever, and more upper respiratory symptoms. RP patients also maintained more remission in their CT imaging than those of NRP patients.

The possible reasons argued by a large number of experts are related to several virological, immunological and sampling methodological factors. Virologically, the false negatives [21] , viral residual [12] , intermittent viral release [12] and viral distribution [22, 23] are usually considered to be major factors. Our data support the notion that the false negatives using commercial kit may partially account for the RP, because the kits had only 30%-50% positive rate of detection [23, 24] . In 24 of various samples from RP patients, RNA was detected to be negative for both N gene and ORF1b gene at several days after their re-admission to the hospital using commercial kit, whose lower limit of detection (LOD) was relatively high (500 copies/ml). However, using a more sensitivity Sherlock kit with an LOD of 100 copies/ml [25] , 75% of samples were detected to be positive for S gene and 41.6% for ORF genes, thus leading to half of positive subjects present within RP patients with undetectable RNA using commercial kit in their hospitalization. By contrast, among 8 samples from NRP patients, none was detected to be positive using either Sherlock or commercial kit. However, in a sample confirmed by SRAS-CoV-2 sequencing, the Sherlock tested it as positive (data not shown). Therefore, future study should improve both the sensitivity and specificity of detection kit, All rights reserved.

Thus other factor may be associated with the RP patients. We could not exclude sampling methodological factors including differential sampling and operational methods, sample quality, and technician expertise levels. Nor could we exclude immunological factors including low mucosal immune responses such as low IgA levels. These factors may take some uncertain risks leading the occurrence of RP patients [4, 27] .
