Convened by the WHO Director-General under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) , the EC considered exportations to other countries and gave evidenced-based advice to the Director-General to support the final decision.

However, SARS-CoV uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor and primarily infects also ciliated bronchial epithelial cells (Fig. 1 ) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , whereas MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) as a receptor and infects unciliated bronchial epithelial cells (Fig. 1) [6, [11] [12] [13] . Structural analyses apparently predict that 2019-nCoV uses also the ACE2 as its host receptor ( Fig. 1) [9, 10, 14] . Recent studies suggest that the 2019-nCoV does not use other coronavirus receptors, aminopeptidase N and DPP4/CD26 [10] . Now, once again, the world faces the emergence of a new pathogen, another coronavirus, with a more important outbreak in terms of number of cases and deaths, compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [15] . Certainly, the 2019-nCoV represents a big threat to global health, with a growing number of cases, as reported by WHO (https://www. who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situationreports/), requiring coordinated efforts, research and development in counter measures, sharing scientific knowledge and information to mitigate the impact of such situation [16] .",

In addition to pre-existing travel health information for travel to China, TravelHealthPro has produced news items to help travellers keep pace with the evolving nature of this outbreak; particularly important when this outbreak has coincided with the national holiday of Chinese New Year, when large numbers of UK travellers will have planned to visit China. Outbreak information is updated daily so that data on cases to other countries can also be tracked. These resources appear to be reaching a large audience -with pageviews to the TravelHealthPro website hitting a new record of 80,000 in one day, and pageviews of the China-specific advice page increasing by over 400%from 9000 views in January 2019, to over 45,000 in January 2020 [unpublished data]. Anecdotally calls to the advice line regarding the outbreak have also increased and this trend is likely to continue as 2019-nCoV cases increase in travel destinations out with China. These early signals of high public concern can help frontline clinical staff in their preparations for potentially similar increases in consultations, and the resources and capacity building this may require.",
