To overcome this shortening of supplies, computerised tomography (CT) scans of lungs have been used for diagnosis, with mixed results and at a risk of false-negatives especially during the early onsets of symptoms [6] . When a shortage in diagnostic kits in China happened, the Chinese health institutions diagnosed COVID-19 in a period in patients based on clinical symptoms alone, resulting in a major peak in the reported cases on February 12 th 2020 [7] . Because clinical symptoms for COVID-19 are sometimes non-specific (cough, mild fever, sore throat, fatigue), similar to other respiratory diseases or even absent despite infection [8, 9] , molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 [9] is necessary for a more correct diagnosis.

In this study we show that substitution of the MagNA Pure purification step with simple heating for 5 min. at 98\u00baC will result in a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 97.4% (86.2-99.9), 100.0% (84.6-100.0) and 98.3% (95% CI=91.1-99.9), respectively, using the SensiFAST TM SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay (supplementary data). The SensiFAST TM SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay was superior in sensitivity to the RealStar\u00ae SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR kit 1.0, which was completely inhibited by the non-purified samples. We have not previously used the QIACube system to purify oropharyngeal swabs, and to our surprise QIACube purification of supposedly COVID-19 negative oropharyngeal swabs resulted in a weak but positive signal (Ct= 41.85) using the SensiFAST TM SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay. Moreover, this positive result could not be confirmed by any other NA purification method or SARS-CoV-2 specific RT-qPCR assay and therefore we cannot confirm if this patient sample is truly positive for COVID-19 using the QIACube purification system or false negative using the MagNA Pure system. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the heating approach was lower when compared to samples confirmed positive by the QIACube. Due to this variation in sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy between different RT-qPCR assays, we recommend that all alternative RT-qPCR assay used together with the heat-processing workflow, should be validated before being implemented in clinical diagnostics.",

However, during a time where the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is so immense and molecular testing is critically challenged by the limited supplied of reagents for NA purification we may use alternative diagnostic methods.
