Over a few months, the disease spread from its likely origin in Southern China to more than two dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia with more than 8400 cases of infection. 1 SARS is characterized by high fever, malaise, rigor, headache and nonproductive cough or dyspnoea and may progress to generalized interstitial infiltrates in the lung. The fatality rate among people with the illness is around 15% (calculated as deaths/(deaths + surviving patients)). 1a A novel coronavirus has been identified as the causative agent of SARS. 2, 3 In order to find an efficient therapy for SARS, many scientists are now focusing on the development of drugs that inhibit the viral main prote-inase (SARS-CoV M pro ) and disrupt the replication cycle of the virus. In May 2003, Hilgenfeld and co-workers showed that the substrate-binding site in SARS-CoV M pro is well conserved compared to those in two other coronavirus main proteinases (HCoV 229E and TGEV M pro ). 4 In addition, they reported similarities between substrate/inhibitor-binding modes of SARS-CoV M pro and the distantly related human rhinovirus 3C proteinase (HRV 3C pro ). Based on these findings, it was suggested that the HRV 3C pro inhibitor, AG7088, could serve as a good starting point for modifications leading to an efficient and bio-available inhibitor for the SARS-CoV M pro and other coronavirus main proteinases. AG7088 is currently under clinical trial for treatment of the \u00d4common cold\u00d5 caused by HRV Scheme 1. ",

The hydrochloride salt was first coupled with 5-methylisoxazole-3-carboxylic acid 3 to give methyl ester 4 in almost quantitative yield. Subsequently, NaBH 4 reduction of 4 in THF methanol afforded b-aminoalcohol 5 in 99% yield. Alcohol 5 was then oxidized to a-aminoaldehyde 6 under Swern conditions. As a-aminoaldehydes are particularly prone to epimerization, no purification was performed on 6. 6 In-stead, the crude product from the Swern oxidation was used directly in the subsequent indium-mediated allylation reaction. Thus, crude aldehyde 6 was reacted with methyl 2-(bromomethyl)acrylate in the presence of indium metal to furnish homoallylic alcohol 7 in overall 66% yield (from 5) with almost complete syn diastereoselectivity (syn/anti = 98:2).",

Clearly, chelation of the a-nitrogen atom and the steric bulkiness of the i-propyl group cannot totally account for the observed selectivity in our reaction. This suggests that the isoxazole group could have been involved. Therefore, we propose that the nitrogen atom of the isoxazole ring coordinates to the indium atom, forming a second five-membered chelated ring (Scheme 5).",

Less puckering of the transition state (R 0 = isoxazole) is now possible (compared to R 0 = Cbz or Boc) to minimize the steric repulsion between the i-propyl group and the COOMe group. The transition state leading to the anti product is therefore further destabilized, resulting in the increase in the syn/anti selectivity from 82:18 and 87:13 to 98:2, respectively. In our synthesis of the L L-leucine analogue of lactone 1, an improvement in the syn/anti selectivity was also clearly demonstrated (Scheme 4). The excellent diastereoselectivity in the allylation step makes our synthetic strategy of 1 very efficient and paves the way for controlling the second stereogenic centre in the molecule.",
