For many firms, it means the difference between getting the job and losing it, satisfying the client or disappointing the client. For example, the professional services firm Deloitte LLP is driving organizational improvement by shifting to the ''One Deloitte'' culture. One Deloitte describes how the firm presents itself to the market; it has a consistent way of doing business in an effort to better serve clients. A key success factor for delivering better service is improving communication to foster integration across functions and among firm members.",

            "text": "In late 2008, U.S. President-Elect Barack Obama moved extraordinarily quickly to put together his economic team, largely because the global economic crisis was in danger of spiraling out of control. Both the U.S. and global markets demanded that Obama act with speed; economic experts agreed that swift and bold action was required to help prevent the U.S. from plummeting into a deep recession. Rahm Emanuel, Obama's designate Chief of Staff said: ''He [Barack Obama] has been working tirelessly with the transition team on the development of his economic team . . . He wants us to move with deliberate haste -emphasis on deliberate, as well as equal emphasis on haste.'' But even in times of crisis, it is paramount that team members ''gel'' so that the team is in a position to have an immediate impact. Innovation requires teamwork and speed. For instance, in most firms, several different divisions have to cooperate in order to develop new products and services and bring them to market. Each division must be predisposed to say yes to new ideas and be willing to do what it takes to execute them. Observers have suggested that Yahoo! is becoming less responsive to market forces, in part because team leaders have started to look for reasons to say no to ideas and initiatives. Individuals have begun to place the needs of their business units ahead of the needs of the corporation. Yahoo! is becoming risk-averse, a dangerous situation for a firm in its market. Hence, the recent shift to ''One Yahoo!''-a set of behaviors designed to encourage teamwork and help decompartmentalize the enterprise.",

There are three necessary conditions for creating and developing this organizational capability, which we call ''one-teaming.'' First, you must have good team leaders who know how to organize a team, task it properly, and manage team processes. Second, you must have employees who are prequalified and trained to be great team members, even though the teams of which they will be part have yet to be formed. They need to be able to short-circuit the time-consuming and energy draining processes of forming, storming, and norming before the team can perform. These processes are important, but they distract newly formed teams from actually performing in crises. Third, the culture of the organization must fully support teamwork as a complement to individual performance. Such a culture is characterized by several conditions: team results are more important than individual outcomes; team members support and help each other for the sake of the team's objectives; team members seek input from others, listen to them, and speak up themselves; and existing systems in the organization facilitate effective team dynamics.",

This is true for many, but certainly not all, business conditions. No doubt, it is faster and easier to simply issue orders and tell people what to do; but this approach doesn't guarantee goal-directed action. In contrast, involving employees in decision-making increases ownership and commitment and fosters a work environment in which employees choose to contribute to team and organizational goals. However, team-based decisions have one major downside: they take time, particularly when the teams have to be assembled, brought up to speed, and taught to work effectively together.",

They make mistakes and perform poorly, and their failures lead to finger pointing and blaming, which further degrade team performance. Often, the consequence is a poorly performing group, rather than a high-achieving team. If this happens often enough, the whole organization develops an anti-teaming bias, and the firm misses out on the benefits that accrue from team-based decision-making. For example, in March 2008, two members of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival's triumvirate of artistic directors resigned just before their first season opened. The resignations were a shock to the Canadian arts community. Stratford insiders opined that, ''it had never really been a happy group.'' What might have contributed to this development? Some observers thought that the personalities of the three artistic directors were too disparate. Others suggested that the artistic directors were not always willing to ''back down'' and work together to create great plays. The team was not united; two camps had emerged. Another reason for the acrimonious relationships was that there was no decision-making protocol for dealing with disagreements on issues such as programming and marketing. The two artistic directors sensed they were without the power to make the decisions they felt needed to be made. It appears that the three artistic directors never made it past the storming and norming phase of team development.",

Our thesis is that people who are selected, trained, and developed to work in teams, and who can work as leaders or followers in any team, before that team is constituted, are more likely to form effective teams faster than those who lack these skills and characteristics. The question is: how do you make this happen? The answer might be found in the lessons from these three stories: Fire at Mann Gulch, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) experiences with the Apollo 13 and Columbia space craft, and the tragic events that unfolded on Mount Everest in 1996. These triumphs and tragedies have spawned many articles and books, in part because they offer some compelling lessons in leadership and teamwork. We revisit these stories to highlight the critical role that one-teaming played in one of the situations, and because we believe that the absence of one-teaming significantly impacted the outcomes of the other two. We also highlight one business organization that made a concerted effort to develop teaming skills in its managers.

What appeared to be a routine firefight turned disastrous as the men raced frantically from a hellish, fast-moving forest-and-grass fire. Less than two hours after the team of 15 elite airborne firefighters had parachuted from a plane, the crew found themselves caught between a raging fire and the rocky slope that blocked their route to safety. With less than a minute remaining before his team would be engulfed by flames, R. Wagner Dodge, the crew chief, discovered a way out. He started an escape fire that cleared a small area of flammable prairie grass and bushes. Dodge survived because he ''literally burned a hole in the raging fire,'' explains Michael Useem in The Leadership Moment. However, most of Dodge's frightened crew ignored his order to jump inside the expanding ring of fire. Instead they tried in vain to outrun the blaze.",

In contrast, the U.S. Forest Service maintained a rotating smokejumper policy. Their teams were based on rest breaks; when a smokejumper returned from an assignment, he dropped to the bottom of the volunteer list. This practice had two key implications: (a) the team did not always represent the strongest assembly of firefighters, either in terms of camaraderie or the knowledge, skills, and judgment needed to fight the next fire and (b) the firefighters did not have the opportunity to develop together as a team, since they fought each fire with a different set of colleagues.

Many of the young and relatively inexperienced smokejumpers had never seen a fire of this magnitude. They had never worked together or shared their experiences, so they weren't well prepared for an emergency situation. Stable group norms and agreed-upon procedures are essential for working through challenges. These norms provide a clear plan for action; for example, how to share information, set priorities, assign individual tasks and responsibilities, and handle contingencies. The smokejumpers never learned how to act as one. The scheduling policies of the U.S. Forest Service had not prepared the men to stick together during challenging situations.",

There, representatives of hospitals and health agencies, police, and government routinely engage in crisis scenario simulations. The objective is to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of the various individuals on the crisis management team (e.g., their team skills, ability to deal with ambiguity, and multi-tasking) before a real crisis hits. This process also evaluates the provinces' emergency response command, communication, and coordination structures. A key learning from Ontario's 2003 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak was that the dual leadership structure that was in place was less than ideal for controlling and combating the outbreak. One person involved in the crisis put it as follows: ''We never knew who was in charge.''

Dodge has been described as a man of technical expertise, but few words. But, as Michael Useem explains, ''Being a person of few words may be fine in a technical position, but it is a prescription for disaster in a position of leadership.'' Dodge came up with the idea of an escape fire, but he could not get his people to follow him. Robert Sallee, one of the survivors, later said, ''With the fire almost on our back, what the hell is the boss doing lighting another fire in front of us?'' Dodge was an unknown to many of the smokejumpers, and he did not know much about them either. Prior to the landing, and during the mission, he had done little to assert himself or establish trust. His reticence denied his crew the value of his decades of knowledge and wisdom gained fighting fires.

Ham's opinion was that the foam strike was not a problem. She failed to invite dissent and did not listen to the experts; she never asked the tough questions. By contrast, Kranz pushed his colleagues to generate options to find solutions and rapidly analyze alternatives. He peppered his colleagues with question after question and demanded answers.

Implicit in these principles is avoiding ''group-think'' by encouraging diversity of thought and intellectual curiosity. Leaders are expected to reduce dangerous complacency by encouraging all employees to voice dissenting opinions and by fostering the attitude of ''it can happen here.''

Eight climbers died, including renowned guides Scott Fischer and Rob Hall, who were each leading paid expeditions to the summit. Many individuals within the climbing community considered Rob Hall to be the ''Dean of the Mountain;'' he had a reputation for reliability and safety. Many have tried to understand what happened that day. Journalist Jon Krakauer was in Hall's party on assignment from Outside magazine, and he later related his experiences on the mountain in the bestseller Into Thin Air. The guide Anatoli Boukreev felt so impugned by Krakauer's book that he co-authored a rebuttal in The Climb.",

Psychological safety is the shared belief that the team is a safe place for taking interpersonal risks. For example, in psychologically safe teams, members trust and respect each other and are confident that they will not be rebuked, marginalized, or penalized for speaking up or challenging prevailing opinions. The idea is that when team members feel safe to raise questions, the team as a whole tends to learn more, and is likely to make better decisions.",

If you don't like a particular decision I make, I'd be happy to discuss it with you afterward, not while we're up on a hill.'' Jon Krakauer: ''A group of complete strangers . . . trust in one's partners is a luxury denied to those who sign on as clients on a guided ascent . . . [we were] a team in name only.'' How is this relevant to one-teaming? There were many questions and doubts on Everest. Scott Fischer appeared to be exhausted, not all climbers were ready to tackle the mountain, the turn-around time wasn't firm, and individual responsibilities were unclear when the group got separated. Krakauer later wrote, ''The accumulation of many little things-a slow accrual, compounding steadily and imperceptibly toward critical mass.'' What would the outcome have been if individual climbers had been comfortable and confident enough to raise their doubts? One-teaming implies that the team leader is also a team member, and willing to create room for others to contribute to the team process. The effective team leader understands that relying on a single pair of eyes or ears is very risky.",

Second, the organization needs to establish systems that both recognize and reward successful team outcomes and foster learning from failure. For example, recruitment and reward systems should reinforce one-teaming values. A compelling example of how one organization shapes and reinforces oneteaming values is WestJet Airlines Ltd. The airline was founded in 1996, and has since turned into a successful enterprise: its share of the domestic airline market continues to increase, and its corporate culture is among the most admired in Canada. Don Bell, one of the founders, explained that: ''We're in the hospitalitybusiness and our culture is everything to us.'' Two core elements of the WestJet culture are a ''cared-for feeling'' and a focus on teamwork. How does WestJet facilitate these values and associated behaviors? First, processes such as selection, performance management, leadership development, rewards and recognition, and measurement bring to light and reinforce the desirable behaviors (e.g., show initiative in meeting and exceeding customer expectations, and demonstrate helping behaviors toward colleagues even during the most difficult times). The senior leadership appointed a team -CARE, or creating a remarkable experience -whose task is to propagate the culture or value set throughout the organization. Second, there is a strong expectation that ''we all pitch in.'' For example, the pilots are expected to help clean the cabin, and members of the senior management team can be spotted in customer service agent uniforms or assisting in the call centre during peak times. Such behaviors are essential to the success of WestJet. Third, there is frequent communication from the senior leadership, both formal and informal. This communication brings a sense of one-ness to the organization. The senior leadership also spends time in listening mode through surveys and fireside chats.",

Medical students practice resuscitation skills on patient simulators. These people understand the need to practice before a crisis happens; not doing so is a recipe for disaster. The flight crew of the US Airways plane that landed it, largely intact, on the Hudson River in January 2009 credited their extensive safety related training to their success in handling this situation, even though they had not practiced for this specific event. Teams cannot coast along, simply assuming they will be able to respond quickly and effectively to situations that require oneteaming. Extensive practice is vital. But look at any team you know and you will very often find it is ill prepared to deal with high-stress situations. It is far better to teach and practice one-teaming before these skills are put to the test in a crisis-like situation. Give the team time to work together and opportunities to bond so they can build the trust and confidence they will need to perform well in a fast-paced environment. Simulate high-stress situations in which one-teaming is likely to be required. Use teaming experiences as data for action-learning and create reflective moments so that the team can constantly improve. It is unlikely that the precise situation you simulate will occur; however, any practice will help the team meld into a highly effective unit when the unthinkable or unpredictable does happen.",

As the story goes, the Apollo 11 space mission was on track to the moon about three percent of the time; almost 97 percent of the journey was spent off-course. But the crew reached its destination because it was continuously checking and correcting. As team leaders, encourage your teams to spend time in both performance and learning modes. The learning mode may not rack up billable hours, but it is critical for developing individual and intact team competencies, building relationships, establishing team norms, and accelerating decision-making.
