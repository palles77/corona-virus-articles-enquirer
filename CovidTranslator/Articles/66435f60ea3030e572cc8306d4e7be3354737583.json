The index patient was linked to an outbreak at a nearby municipal hospital. Three clusters were identified over a 3-week period. The first cluster (5 patients) and the second cluster (14 patients) occurred among patients, family members, and nursing aids. The third cluster (12 patients) occurred exclusively among healthcare workers. Six healthcare workers had close contact with SARS patients. Six others, with different working patterns, indicated that they did not have contact with a SARS patient. Environmental surveys found 9 of 119 samples of inanimate objects to be positive for SARS coronavirus RNA. These observations indicate that although transmission by direct contact with known SARS patients was responsible for most cases, environmental contamination with the SARS coronavirus may have lead to infection among healthcare workers without documented contact with known hospitalized SARS patients.",

The ER is organized into several sections, including triage, examination, observation, critical care, and a clean area reserved for staff activities. A SARS screening unit was established on March 17, 2003, to interview and triage febrile patients with suspected cases of SARS. The patients were questioned about the presence of fever, myalgia, gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms, whether they had close contact with a SARS patient, and recent travel. N95 respirators were placed on patients suspected to have SARS early during the triage process, and they were immediately placed in private rooms (SARS area) to avoid contact with others in the ER. A daily record was maintained of all patients screened in the SARS screening unit. SARS cases were defined according to the World Health Organization criteria (10) , modified to expand the definition of contact to include any healthcare setting with nosocomial transmission.",

A volume of 5 \u00b5L of RNA solution was analyzed.

This ready-to-use system is designed for specific amplification of the 80-bp region of the SARS-CoV genome and for directly detecting the specific amplicon in fluorimeter channel F1 of the LightCycler Instrument. In addition, these reagents contain a second heterologous amplification system to identify possible PCR inhibition. Internal controls in each run of the experiment included two negative controls (one for RNA extraction and one for RT-PCR) and four quantification standards (1 x 10 1 copies/\u00b5L, 1 x 10 2 copies/\u00b5L, 1 x 10 3 copies/\u00b5L, and 1 x 10 4 copies/\u00b5L).

Six of the cases among the healthcare workers had no direct SARS patient contact. They may have acquired their infection from commonly used, contaminated objects. Finding SARS-CoV RNA in nine commonly used inanimate objects supports this notion. Although the signal only Environmental contamination was first demonstrated during a community outbreak in Hong Kong (13) . The SARS virus may be stable in the environment at room temperature for 1 to 2 days (8) . It can survive on plastic surfaces, stainless steel, glass slides, and paper files. The virus can survive even longer (up to 4 days) in stool from patients with diarrhea (8) . In some series, diarrhea is a common complaint of SARS patients (14) . One patient (patient 2) in the first cluster had intestinal bleeding, and 4 of 14 patients in the second cluster had diarrhea.",

In addition, overworked medical staff may not follow preventive procedures and take inadequate precautions (15, 16) . After the outbreak in hospital A, healthcare workers in the ER wore N-95 respirators for all patient care. Using protective equipment may account for the absence of cases among healthcare workers during the first and the second clusters of SARS in the ER. However, the third cluster included six healthcare workers who were not exposed to patients with SARS. Thus, masks do not prevent acquisition from environmental sources. Furthermore, the spread of SARS was most likely facilitated by lack of proper handwashing than by direct contact with patients or environments contaminated with viral nucleic acids. Therefore, intensive environmental cleaning should be instituted as soon as a case is identified, particularly for those with diarrhea. In addition, the importance of handwashing cannot be overemphasized.",
