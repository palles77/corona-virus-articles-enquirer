Participants included 660 college students who consented to complete a questionnaire. The results showed significant differences between students who perceived that they were at risk for type 2 diabetes onset and those who thought their peers were the ones at risk. A higher prevalence of participants thought their peers were the ones at risk for type 2 diabetes. Women were more likely than men to report a higher risk perception, indicating that their peers were at lower risk for diabetes onset.",

However, as reported by the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study (1) between 2001 and 2005, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among younger age-groups (<20 years of age) more than doubled. There has also been an increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among people in their 30s (2) (3) (4) . In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 25.6 million people \u226520 years of age and 215,000 individuals <20 years of age are affected by diabetes (5). Diabetes is now the leading cause of chronic diseases of childhood and adolescence in the United States (1, 6) . Because type 2 diabetes affects children and adolescents, college students are not exempt from developing diabetes. Therefore, there is a need to assess college students' perception of their risk for developing type 2 diabetes and to tailor appropriate messages to meet their needs.",

A survey of 400 college students revealed that 46.7% of the sample did not engage in vigorous physical activity, and 16.7% were physically inactive (10) . Based on research findings linking weight gain and reduced levels of physical activity to increased risk of type 2 diabetes, it is advisable for this population to learn about preventing or delaying the onset of this condition (11) . Type 2 diabetes diagnosed at younger ages could place an additional economic burden on society because of the health complications commonly associated with this disease and associated premature mortality, as well as increased health care costs (12) . Unfortunately, young adults may not be aware of the increased risk for type 2 diabetes that results from their lifestyle (e.g., unhealthy food and beverage choices and reduced levels of physical activity). Therefore, targeted diabetes education programs are needed to give these individuals an opportunity to learn about how they can modify their lifestyle while there is still time to prevent or delay the onset of dia-betes at an early age. However, before attempting to tailor type 2 diabetes awareness programs for this population, it is necessary to identify their perception of their risks for developing diabetes.",

A few studies of risk perception and diabetes have been conducted among college students. One survey was designed to determine college students' perception of their risk for developing diabetes in the next 10 years (15) . The results showed that participants who identified themselves as being part of a racial or ethnic group other than non-Hispanic white and who had family members with diabetes perceived an absolute 10-year risk of diabetes onset (15) . Another study found that participants rated their risk for diabetes onset lower than their risk for heart disease (16). A third study focusing on perceived susceptibility among college students found that 32% of a sample of 707 students perceived themselves to be susceptible to developing diabetes (17) . It has been proposed that individuals must perceive that they are at high risk of developing a disease to consider modifying their health behaviors to prevent its onset (18) .",

Individuals in general believe that they are less likely than other people to experience negative health outcomes (24).
