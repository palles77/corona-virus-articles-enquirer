            "text": "Originally reported in the literature in the later part of the 19th century, neonatal NEC has stimulated increased interest with the advent of modern neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) during the 1960s.144J 17X) Is3 Because of this disease's propensity to affect low-birth-weight infants in neonatal intensive care units, clinicians hypothesized that some factor or factors associated with the care of sick premature infants caused or initiated the disease. This hypothesis generated a search for multiple risk factors that were purported to contribute to the etiolom of NEC. Early hypotheses suggested chorioamnionitis and swallowed pathogenic bacteria at birth as additional risk factors. Finally an observation that almost all infants with NEC were fed milk formula prior to the illness focused attention on neonatal feeding practices, including the composition of the formula, total daily volume, and the rate at which feedings were increased. In the 1980s we began to realize that neonatal NEC is a complex, and probably multifactorial, disease. Nonetheless, the pathogenesis has yet to be determined. Among hospitalized premature infants in neonatal intensive care units NEC is the most common serious acquired gastrointestinal tract disease.3f) 'lo Indeed in a recent study from the Medical Center Hospital of San Antonio (Texas), which included 31,000 births, NEC followed immediately behind respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) as a significant cause of n&onatal mortality at that center.z7 Respiratory distress syndrome was the presumptive cause of death in 7% while NEC accounted for 6% of deaths. 27 As a cause of intestinal perforation NEC exceeds gastrointestinal obstruction, spontaneous perforation of the bowel, Hirschsprung's disease, feeding tube accidents, and meconium ileus.l' In the United States approximately 2,000 to 4,000 newborn infants each year develop NEC.31'f10 Although many of these infants develop the disease in an NICU during the course of treatment of the diseases common to all premature infants, an increasing number of patients are developing NEC or a NEC-like illness in level I well-baby nurseries in community hospitals.",

Both roentgenographic signs are relatively specific for NEC and are helpful in confirming the diagnosis (see below). Furthermore, NEC may occur as an endemic or sporadic disease or may occur as intermittent epidemics superimposed on the endemic rate.

            "text": "Neonatal NEC is predominantly a disease of premature infants that develops during their hospitalization in a level III NICU. 78, 80, 107, 171, 205 Nonetheless, approximately 7% to 10% of patients are not premature, but are full-term infants admitted to the NICU for cyanotic heart disease, diarrhea, polycythemia, or antecedent anatomical intestinal malformations.107J160 Some of these more mature infants have had operative palliation of cyanotic heart disease or repair of congenital gastrointestinal tract anomalies. Recently, we and others have observed NEC developing in babies in level I nurseries. These patients were either previously healthy full-term infants or \"larger\" premature infants. This latter group includes premature infants who were \"reverse transferred\" back to a level I nursery from a level III NICU. These premature infants were recovering from the usual diseases of prematurity and most of these infants required only additional time and nutritional care to \"gain and grow.\" The other group of premature infants who have developed NEC in level I nurseries are those who were thought to be well enough (on the basis of size, ability to feed, and the absence of significant cardiopulmonary disease) to remain in a well-baby nursery. It is important to emphasize that in addition to infants with documented classical NEC, other infants in these nurseries simultaneously have also developed milder gastrointestinal disturbances, often characterized by abdominal distention, occult blood, or frank hematochezia. 176 Among patients who develop NEC in level III neonatal units, the average birth weight is 1,400 to 1,500 gm, and mean gestational age is usually 30 to 32 weeks.1061f3 When compared with the general population of infants with neonatal problems admitted to the same intensive care nursery, there are usually no differences in birth weight or gestational age for patients with and without NEC. Thus, it would appear that the disease affects premature infants in the NICU indiscriminately.",

Although seasonal epidemics have been suggested, there is a paucity of evidence that suggests a consistent relationship between NEC and seasonality. 175 Patient characteristics appear to be different during clustered cases of NEC. Epidemic patients tend to be older or more mature, have fewer antecedent neonatal diseases, develop NEC later, and have been fed for a longer period of time than patients with endemic NEC. 107, 145 In the past, epidemics have been thought to be related to overcrowding in the NICU, to suboptimal nurse-to-patient ratios, or to large numbers of \"very sick\" infants.

On rare occasions, NEC has been reported in siblings during different pregnancies. Nonetheless, most studies do not demonstrate familial or genetic factors that predispose patients to this disease. Twin status has been investigated among patients with neonatal NEC. In an earlier report from our hospital, 13 of 123 patients with NEC were from multiple gestations .lo7 Of these infants, in only one set of twins did both infants develop NEC within 24 hours of each other. Both infants also had bacteremia with identical Escherichia coli. Multiple gestation is a common cause of prematurity and the incidence of twins among patients with neonatal NEC is not different than the incidence of twins in the general population of premature infants who do not develop NEC. In a study of NEC among multiple gestations, Samm and colleagues investigated the epidemiology of NEC in twins and demonstrated that the firstborn \"A\" twin was always the twin to NEC report the total number of cases of NEC in an NICU, and compare that with the total number of patients admitted to that unit. This includes many severely ill, premature infants who die in the first three days of life due to complex cardiorespiratory diseases. The vast majority (over 90%) of patients who develop neonatal NEC do so after the initiation of enteric alimentation with milk feedings. Thus, by including infants who die before a time when NEC would usually develop, these figures underestimate the incidence of NEC in the population at risk. The remaining at-risk group consists of the surviving premature infants who are ready to initiate enteric milk feedings. If infants who die early are excluded and only infants who have been fed are included, the incidence of NEC in level III NICUs approaches 15% .l13",

The diagnosis of neonatal NEC will be considered only after more specific gastrointestinal manifestations have been identified. Nonspecific signs of NEC may also be found in many neonatal diseases, such as sepsis, hypoglycemia, and intraventricular hemorrhage. These signs include apnea, bradycardia, lethargy, temperature instability, poor cutaneous circulation, and a \"septic\" appearance (Table 1) . M ore specific findings related to gastrointestinal dysfunction include, in order of decreasing frequency, abdominal distention, abdominal tenderness, the presence of occult or frank blood in the stools, anterior abdominal wall erythema, and a right lower quadrant mass. When these latter manifestations are present the diagnosis of NEC must be considered and a thorough evaluation performed (see Table 1 ).",

Upper gastrointestinal tract series with metrizamide contrast studies have helped to identify gaseous blebs even before they were detectable on plain roentgenograms .lol Although metrizamide is isotonic, safe, and without reported complications, we should remain cautious about the use of this agent until further experience has been reported. Ultrasonographic demonstration of hepatic portal venous gas has been a new, safe, and more sensitive method of detecting \"microbubbles\" of gas that are below the resolution of the plain abdominal x-ray film. Malin and co-workers*3g originally described an incidental finding of \"microbubbles\" entering the heart from below the diaphragm in a child yho developed fulminant NEC.13' Subsequent reports studied additional patients with neonatal NEC and demonstrated a characteristic ultrasonographic pattern of intermittent \"microbubbles\" within the portal vein of the liver. In some patients plain x-ray films showed no evidence of portal gas or pneumatosis intestinalis. This method holds great promise as a new and sensitive tool for the diagnosis of the abnormal intestinal gas production in NEC.\"' The usefulness of ultrasound to detect intravascular gas must be interpreted with caution in patients with intravenous infusions in the lower extremity. \"Microbubbles\" generated with such infusions may result in false-positive signs of intravascular gas. Ultrasound is not helpful in diagnosing pneumatosis intestinalis because the gaseous distention of the bowel greatly interferes with the ability to identify mucosal cysts. Additional radiologic tests to diagnose NEC include radionucleotide scans with a radiolabel tagged to leukocytes or platelets.m Although these new methods hold some promise, there is concern about the dose of radioactive label and the overall sensitivity and specificity of these scans. Much more work is required to define the lowest (safest) radioactive dose possible and to determine the false-positive and false-negative rate.",

However, other studies were unable to confirm the specificity of this test for neonatal NEC as many well premature infants demonstrate excessive and prolonged breath hydrogen excretion following a lactose-containing formula feeding. Newborn infants often demonstrate a persistently elevated hydrogen excretion with no additional increase after, or fall before, the subsequent feeding. Breath hydrogen levels as high as 70 to 100 ppm have been noted in normal preterm infants. Hydrogen production is dependent on formula malabsorption plus bacteric that can ferment lactose to this gas. As some bacteria do not produce hydrogen gas, this test may not be helpful in every case of NEC.

On the other hand, most patients with severe NEC worsen rapidly and manifest an exquisitely tender abdomen, acidosis, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, shock, and bacteremia within 24 to 48 hours of onset. Indeed the mean time for development of documented intestinal perforation in these seriously ill patients is 36 hours, while the median time is less than 24 hours and the mode or most frequent time of perforation is less than 12 hours after the onset of symptoms. 108 Investigations of the therapy and pathogenesis of NEC have been hindered by the failure to uniformly define the severity of the disease at the time of diagnosis.

Specific grading criteria will permit accurate comparisons of patients with disease of similar severity.

On day 8, lethargy, abdominal distention, bilious nasogastric drainage, and guaiac-positive stools developed. A complete evaluation for sepsis was performed. The white blood cell (WESC) count was 14,800 with 40% polymorphonuclear forms, and 10% band forms. Lumbar puncture was unremarkable, as was an arterial blood gas analysis. An anterior-posterior portable roentgenogram of the abdomen revealed a discrete area of pueumatosia intestinalis in the descending colon, with generalized distention of the bowel. The cross-table lateral examination showed no free air. The infant was given nothing by mouth (NPO), the bowel was decompressed with nasogastric drainage, and intravenous administration of ticarcillin and gentamicin was started. Serial complete blood cell counts and blood gas analyses were performed, and cross-table lateral roentgeuogras of the abdomen were performed every 6 hours. The leukocyte count was stable. Twelve hours after the acute onset, an x-ray showed the pneumatosis to be resolved. The infant clinically was more alert, but still had mild tenderness to abdominal palpation. She appeared completely well 48 hours after presentation. She was treated with bowel rest and intravenous antibiotics for 10 days.

Nonetheless, stage IIB and, more often, stage IIIA, may progress to intestinal perforation within 12 to 48 hours of onset. We have cared for patients who had stage IIIA neonatal NEC, who developed a gasless abdomen with ascites. Ascites persisted for 5 to 7 days before gastrointestinal perforation was documented on radiologic examination. These patients were atypical because, as stated earlier, most infants with neonatal NEC suffer perforation within 48 hours after the onset of symptoms. CLASSIFICATION OF NEONATAL NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS Through the use of staging criteria we can gain a better appreciation of the wide range of severity of neonatal NEC. In addition to staging the severity of the disease process, there is an additional need to classify NEC according to the clinical patterns of this disease .ll\" Necrotizing enterocolitis has been reported to present with different, but characteristic, clinical patterns. Furthermore, many neonatal gastrointestinal illnesses are not NEC but may mimic NEC, and need to be considered in the differential diagnoses. We propose to subdivide NEC on the basis of the preceding historical events, the clinical presentation, and the pattern of the disease. This is not the same as staging, which basically considers the severity of the illness, but does not address differing etiologies. Many of the subgroups within this classification system represent a distinct clinical and pathological entity. This classification will also include illnesses that are clinically distinct, and have pneumatosis intestinalis and more or less severe intestinal and systemic signs compatible with classical NEC. Such a classification system will permit accurate comparison of studies on the epidemiology or treatment of NEC. The present situation may be analogous to the state of oncology in previous years when all leukemia was lumped together in one disease category. Today, using sophisticated methods, we can subdivide the leukemias on the basis of cell type, cell markers, and other properties. Specific treatment protocols for the specific types of leukemia have increased survival from this serious illness.",

Epidemic NEC is common in some ~1~~~. 83, 107, 145 In an epidemic, the severity of the illness is usually similar among patients. Epidemics of mild or severe disease have been witnessed at the same neonatal intensive care unit at different time periods. During epidemics of well-documented NEC there is often an increased incidence of other neonatal gastrointestinal or systemic diseases. Hemorrhagic colitis, without pneumatosis intestinalis, is a milder form of gastrointestinal disease than NEC. Hemorrhagic colitis is characterized by frank, bright red blood per rectum and minimal abdominal distention. In one study of an epidemic of neonatal NEC due to rotavirus A, there was also an increased prevalence of hemorrhagic colitis. 176 Other investigators have also noted concomitant epidemics of NEC and hemorrhagic colitis caused not by rotavirus A, but by an unidentified infectious agent. Additionally, NEC due to enterovirus has been reported during neonatal intensive care unit epidemics.1z0 In this report, NEC was only one manifestation of enteroviral disease; other patients manifested viral sepsis, myocarditis, or hepatitis. Because of the complexity and possible multifactorial etiology of NEC it is important that future reports of NEC provide data on the endemic vs. epidemic nature of this disease. As discussed previously, it appears that the patient populations in whom neonatal NEC develops during epidemic periods differ from the patient populations seen during endemic periods.'45 Furthermore, our own experience suggests that covariable factors, such as enteric alimentation practices, probably have a greater influence on patients with endemic NEC than on patients during an epidemic.",

In adult mammals local blood flow to the bowel significantly increases during a meal. Blood flow increases specifically to the intestinal mucosa during a standard feeding. This mucosal hyperemia assists the digestion and absorption of nutrients and is due in part to local vasodilation reflexes, humoral signals, and specific metabolic changes associated with nutrient absorption. These may also be mediated by vasodilator agents such as prostacyclin or glucagon. The result is increased local mucosal flow, oxygen extraction, and oxygen consumption.5\".A similar response has been noted in some, but not all, neonatal mammals as evidenced by postprandial intestinal hyperemia.5\" Presently, there is a paucity of comparative physiologic studies on the maturation of intestinal blood flow or on the potential relationship between abnormalities of the regulation of intestinal blood flow and serious neonatal gastrointestinal diseases such as NEC. One indirect measure of circulatory changes during a feeding is to determine perturbations of extremity or calf blood flow.lW Term infants respond to an enteric feeding with a decreased blood flow to the calf while in marked contrast, preterm infants demonstrate no significant change of calf flow during a feeding. The peripheral vascular response of full-term infants indirectly suggests shunting of blood to the intestines, while the response of premature infants, although circumstantial, suggests poor intestinal autoregulation with no increase of intestinal blood flow during a feeding.

Human breast milk feeding had been proposed as possible protection against the development of NEC.\" 15', Is3 Human milk, with its many immunoprotective properties, has been thought to be effective in preventing many infectious diseases, including upper respiratory tract infections, gastroenteritis, neonatal sepsis, and, possibly, NEC. 75J \"j 124j 213 At birth there is a paucity of local intestinal secretory IgA present. Human milk is a rich source of IgA and other immunoprotective factors, such as lysozyme, lactoperoxidase, lactoferrin, interferon, bifidus factor, and a high carbohydrate composition, which decreases luminal pH .3t \" The alteration of luminal pH enhances the growth of Lactobacillus bifidus, which inhibits the growth of gram-negative pathogens. In addition to these components, human milk also contains neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages. The latter cell represents 80% to 90% of breast milk cells. The macrophage is thought to be the most active immunoprotective cell in human milk. Animal models of NEC suggest that breast milk but not formula can protect newborn pup~.~ Fresh, but not frozen, breast milk was protective. Further studies determined that the breast milk macrophage was the factor that prevented the experimental NEC in this newborn animal model. However, we should always be careful when extrapolating animal data to those related to human disease. Necrotizing enterocolitis has been reported in preterm infants fe.d exclusively with fresh pasteurized or frozen human milk.63j *13, w 'G The nature and the incidence of NEC in patients fed refrigerated human milk was not different than that in formula-fed infants.l13 In the other studies, the mode of treatment of the milk may be a factor as freezing, pasteurizing, or boiling human milk will interfere with or destroy the various immunologic components of fresh milk. Nonetheless, it would appear that feeding even immunologically intact human milk does not decrease the incidence or severity of NEC. Bauchner and Go-workers' have critically reviewed the literature on the effectiveness of breast feeding in prevention of many other infectious diseases of the older infant. After eliminating many poorly controlled studies these authors concluded that there was little if any strong evidence that breast-feeding reduces the incidence of infections in term infants in an industrialized society? Breast-feeding also had no effect on the incidence of rotavirus enteritis compared with that in formula-fed infants. Thus, although there are many beneficial effects of breast-feeding, there is little evidence to support the hypothesis that the absence of human milk feedings contributes to the etiology of neonatal NEC.",

This lower incidence of NEC was isolated to the study period; once enteral alimentation was initiated among the parenterally fed infants, NEC then developed among these infants. Thus, parenteral alimentation may not prevent neonatal NEC but only delay its onset. Similar observations were noted by Ostertag and co-workers156 in another prospective study comparing high-risk infants fed initially with a diluted formula with those who received parenteral alimentation alone. 156 Brown and Sweet have advocated a very cautious and slow feeding schedule to prevent neonatal NEC.30'31 These experienced neonatologists suggested that the rate of feeding and the absolute volume of individual feedings may place the \"high-risk\" infant at risk for NEC. Although most of their assumptions are based on retrospective analyses of their data from one hospital, they claim that the incidence of NEC decreased substantially in their nursery after the introduction of this very conservative feeding protocol. For example, they propose that a typical 1,000~gm infant should be fed slowly and not advanced to full feedings by mouth until 2 weeks into his feeding schedule. Signs of feeding intolerance, distention, Hematest-positive stools, or apnea warrants the discontinuation of enter& alimentation for various periods of time. Goldman also reported that the incidence of NEC increased in his nursery when large feeding increments or large absolute daily volumes were given to preterm infants. 73 The maximal volume increase was greater than 60 ml/kg/day and maximum total daily feeding was greater than 150 ml/kg/day. Book and co-workers also suspected that a change in the feeding policy in their nursery resulted in an increased incidence of NEC. 21 During the period with a higher incidence of NEC the rate of increment of feeding advancement increased from 8.6 ml/kg/day to 20 ml/ kg/day. In a small prospective study of 29 patients comparing a slow increment of formula feeding of 10 ml/kg/day with a moderate increment of 20 ml/kg/day, Book and colleagues were unable to demonstrate an increased incidence of NEC in their more rapidly fed group. We recently evaluated the effects of feeding practices on endemic cases of NEC in a case-controlled study (unpublished data, 1986) . Although average day-to-day feeding practices were not different between patients with NEC and their time and gestational agematched controls, we observed that very significant differences were hidden by averaging. When the data were reanalyzed it became evident that the patients who developed NEC were fed greater volumes of formula and at a faster rate than age-matched controls. The day of maximum feeding increment was day 3 of feeding; on that day,' patients with NEC received an increase of 57 ml/kg/day compared with an increment of 22 ml/kg/day in patients who did not develop NEC. The day of life of maximum feed volume was day 8; on that day, patients who developed NEC received 124 ml/kg/day with a dayto-day increment of 28 ml/kg/day vs. a total of 83 ml/kg/day and an increment of 17 ml/kg/day in controls. Both our data and previous reports also found a relationship between total fluid intake and NEC. Patients who developed N-EC also had a greater total (intravenous plus enteric) intake than controls. These data strongly suggest that the total volume given to very-low-birth-weight infants should be monitored carefully and that daily increments of greater than 25 ml/ kg/day may stress the immature gastrointestinal system. Although this was not a randomized study, the control group and NEC patients were equivalent in terms of birth weight and other significBnt \"risk factors.\" We conclude from all these data that the very small premature infant should be fed cautiously during the first 1 to 2 weeks of life. We recommend avoiding large day-to-day volume increments and gradually advancing the feeding schedule. A recommended feeding protocol is presented in Table 6 .",

Alternatively, an excessive milk load may overcome enzymatic capacity and result in lactose malabsorption. The activity of the enzyme lactase may be lower in the preterm infant than the term infant or older child. Lactose malabsorption would provide fermentable substrate for the enteric bacteria that inhabit the colonic flora. Normal premature infants malabsorb some lactose, as demonstrated by their increased rate of hydrogen production. When excessive lactose is available for the colonic bacterial flora, bacterial proliferation may ensue, producing even more hydrogen gas and initiating the pathogenesis of NEC. Engel demonstrated that the gas in both the intestinal lumen and the submucosal cysts of pneumatosis intestinalis in patients with NEC is in part composed of hydrogen gas? Furthermore, the bacteria isolated from these patients do not produce hydrogen gas in regular media unless infant formula is added to the incubation mixture. Enteric bacterial fermentation is the only known source for hydrogen gas in the human .15' Additional evidence of the role of carbohydrate malabsorption in NEC is the observation that patients with this disease have increased fecal excretion of reducing substances, as determined by the Clinitest reaction.22 These data strongly suggest that bacterial fermentation of formula-derived carbohydrates contributes to the pathophysiology of neonatal NEC. Whether gaseous distention itself interferes with intestinal or mucosal perfusion or is simply a marker for abnormal bacterial fermentation or proliferation has not been proved. The combination of carbohydrate fermentation, altered local redox states (from organic acid fermentation products), and stasis with bacterial overgrowth may perturb the bacterial microenvironment and result in the emergence of pathogenic bacteria with or without enterotoxin production. Alterations of the intestinal microbiologic flora due to dietary changes or immaturity have been held responsible for other enteric infectious diseases. Normally there is a balance between the facultative anaerobic gram-negative organisms and the obligate anaerobic organisms .13'j lg2 A system of symbiosis with \"checks and balances\" between the organisms of the colonic microflora called colonization resistance prevents the emergence of a pathologic strain. This system of bacterial interference is one of the antimicrobial mechanisms of breast milk feeding that stimulates growth of Lactobacillus bzjidus, which in turn interferes with the growth of other enteric bacteria.174 Perturbations such as dietary changes, inhibition of trypsin, suppression of facultative aerobic bacteria by broad-spectrum antibiotics, and changes in the local redox state following malabsorption interfere with this microbial symbiosis and may result in bacterial overgrowth or stimulate enterotoxin production. Eosinophilic colitis with pneumatosis intestinalis is rare but has been reported in a few patients with NEC.\" 161 romolecules is incomplete during the neonatal period compared with that function in normal adults who do not usually absorb macromolecules across an intact bowel ~all.~~'~'~ Either transplacental passage of anti-milk protein antibodies or the endogenous production of antibodies against these proteins could initiate a local immune inflammatory response in the intestinal mucosa and submucosa.

Infants with NEC develop bacteremia, neutropenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and shock. Many NICUs have epidemic, or clustered cases of NEC linked in time or place.23' lo7) 145~171~175 Because of high attack rates and significant morbidity and mortality, nurseries are often forced to close to further admissions until the epidemic can be controlled. To the frustration of many investigators, a single pathogen has not been recovered from all epidemics. Furthermore, standard microbiologic investigations of most epidemics often fail to reveal the cause of the epidemic. On occasion when a single agent has been recovered from patients with NEC, the same organism has also been recovered from asymptomatic control patients.\"' lo6j ls8 The bacteria that have been isolated, in careful studies, from the stools of infants with NEC include E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloace, Pseudomonas sp., Salmonella sp., S. epidermidis, Enterobatter sakazakii, Clostridium perfringens, C. d@icile, C. butyricum, coronavirus,, rotavirus (both type A and non-A), and enteroviruses. 48, 62, 81, 87, 90, 91, 94, 120, 125, 150, 162, 193, 195, 199 During epidemics of well-documented NEC there is often a general increase of gastrointestinal disturbances in other neonatal patients in the premature infant ICU. These gastrointestinal problems include bright red blood per rectum in infants without pneumatosis intestinalis .176 There is also more symptomatology, an increased prevalence of \"septic workups,\" and of infants placed on NPO for suspected NEC. Furthermore, before, during, and after an epidemic of NEC among neonatal patients, we and others have observed gastrointestinal illness among the house staff and nurses working in the ICU. 70 In addition, children in the community or their parents may also be affected by various forms of gastrointestinal disease characterized by cramps, emesis, or diarrhea. Epidemics of NEC have also been abated by employing strict infectious disease control measures to prevent the spread of the as yet unidentified agent (see following) . 23, 175 Alterations of the fecal flora have been reported in patients with NEC. 11J25j67 Although colonization of the stool does not necessarily indicate bacterial invasiveness or disease causation, it may reflect overrepresentation of one microorganism and a shift in the microflora, resulting in an imbalance between pathogenic and endogenous bacteria. Normally, colonized bacteria are not present in newborn infants at birth. The first meconium stool among normal infants is usually sterile. Infants born following prolonged rupture of the membranes may demonstrate umbilical, cutaneous, or nasopharyngeal colonization with the same bacteria that colonize the mother's vagina, cervix, or rectum.\") 74 In infants born by vaginal delivery without prolonged rupture of the membranes, colonization occurs within 4 hours after birth with bacteria from the maternal genital or rectal flora and from the nursery environment.74 There is a high correlation between maternal cervical or rectal bacteria and those later recovered in the neonatal gastric aspirate.\" This sequence may be modified by cesarean section, maternal antibiotic treatment, premature birth, neonatal intensive care practices, and the mode of feeding (breast or formula milk).13! 74 Colonization is delayed by antibiotic therapy, cesarean section, or being placed NPO. Broad-spectrum antibiotics often suppress the normal aerobic bacteria resulting in emergence of resistant organisms or overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria.",

Anaerobic bacteria predominate in the colon while an equal mixture of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria is found in the stomach and jejunum.

In another study, Bacteroides sp. and lactobacilli were seen less frequently in patients with NEC, while C. pefiirzgens was recovered more often in patients with this disease.17 Nonetheless, these alterations of the fecal flora are not universally present in all cases or epidemics of NEC. Furthermore, increased colony counts of E. coli or K. pneumoniae may be the result of the primary pathogenic event and not the cause itself. For example, abnormal enteric microbiologic flora may occur after viral gastroenteritis if the normal colonic microenvironment is disturbed.",

Pigbel may occur in a range from mild illness to a severe state similar to that of stage IIIB NEC. Pigbel has occurred following sudden dietary changes during a seasonal pig feast in Papua, New Guinea. Alterations of diet, combined with borderline malnutrition, may initiate enteric toxin production, while trypsin deficiency or trypsin neutralization may prolong the toxin's half-life. Prior to the identification of C. perjkingens toxin, pigbel was a disease of unknown origin thought to be due to many different causes, including gastrointestinal ischemia. The latter was based on the histopathologic appearance of the intes-tinal tissue. Because of excellent epidemiologic and microbiologic investigations, the agent and its toxin have been identified.

As discussed by Glass,71 we have successfully unraveled the infectious etiology of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), legionnaires' disease, and toxic shock syndrome, but the etiology of other common infectious-like diseases such as NEC has (to date) escaped detection. If 10% of all births in the United States are low-birth-weight infants and if the lowest incidence of NEC as reported is 1% of premature infants, then 1% of 250,000 or 2,500 cases of NEC occur each year in the United States. This is probably a very conservative estimate of a common neonatal problem. Approximately 20% to 40% of patients with NEC will die. Many of the patients with NEC had been successfully treated for other neonatal problems, such as RDS and patent ductus arteriosus. The occurrence of another lethal neonatal disease is even more tragic after overcoming a previous neonatal illness. These data suggest that NEC is a substantial perinatal public health concern that warrants close attention. To further unravel the etiologic agent or agents of NEC, the same intense effort is needed as has been applied to previous successful epidemiologic and infectious disease investigations (see Table 7 ).",

This sign has traditionally been an absolute indication for surgical treatment. Nonetheless, on rare occasions, NEC in the presence of perforation has been managed medically due to the temporary lack of availability of a surgeon at the time of an epidemic.l(j5 In this report, a small number of low-birth-weight infants did as well as other patients who had previously undergone operative intervention. Furthermore, there have been reports of conservative management replacing exploratory laparotomy and intestinal resection. These therapies include the placement of a peritoneal drain, with or without peritoneal lavage with an antibiotic so1ution.g6 Although these modalities have theoretical value they must be considered experimental as their true role in the management of patients with severe NEC has not been appropriately tested in a controlled trial. A second method to determine the presence of intestinal perforation and intestinal gangrene is by performing abdominal paracentesis. 114J16g It has been hypothesized that prior to the demonstration of free intra-abdominal gas there are microperforations due to intestinal gangrene of the bowel that may result in fecal contamination of the peritoneal cavity. Kosloske and co-workers116 suggested that infants with a positive peritoneal tap who undergo exploratory laparotomy have a lower mortality than infants who undergo surgery for evidence of free intra-abdominal gas. Paracentesis is performed with the right or left lower abdominal quadrant dependent, using a small, 25-gauge needle. The fluid is examined for color and the presence of bacteria. Positive paracentesis is indicated by (1) dark yellow to brown colored fluid; (2) presence of bacteria on Gram stain; or (3) both of these. Kosloske and co-workersl\" have the greatest experience with paracentesis for the diagnosis of intestinal gangrene. Brown peritoneal fluid or bacteria was observed in 26 of 36 infants with NEC in one study. All 26 with a positive tap had gangrenous bowel resected during exploratory laparotomy. Four of ten infants with a negative paracentesis required surgery and were found to have necrotic bowel.

However, various studies and our experience have not consistently found these to be valid criteria. We feel that none of these criteria alone are indications for surgery. We have cared for many patients with thrombocytopenia, acidosis, a right lower quadrant mass, persistent isolated bowel loops, abdominal wall erythema, and hepatic portal venous gas who did not go on to develop pneumoperitoneum and who did well with aggressive medical management. Clinical deterioration and failure to respond to medical management require strict criteria (Table 10) . Vigorous fluid resuscitation, high-dose dobutamine with low-dose dopamine, early endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, and judicious use of sodium bicarbonate must be attempted for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours (in the absence of pneumoperitoneum) before medical management should be considered to have failed. Furthermore, right lower quadrant masses probably represent localized perforations or an inflammatory mass of bowel and can be appropriately managed with medical treatment.

Even with documented suppression of the gram-negative fecal flora, NEC is not completely eliminated.25 Enteric aminoglycosides may astomosis prior to discharge from the hospital to avoid rehospitalization for severe diarrhea and dehydration. Long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up studies of patients with NEC who do not develop the chronic sequelae of short bowel syndrome, cholestatic jaundice, or other hyperalimentatioh complications are very encouragir& \"I lgf3 (Table 15 ). Uncomplicated cases of NEC have an excellent long-term prognosis, which is basically similar to that of their peer group of low-birth-weight infants. Often the common diseases of prematurity, such as asphyxia, BUS, and intraventricular hemorrhage, are more significant in predicting neurodevelopmental outcome than the occurrence of NEC. Moderate to severe neurologic impairment with late morbidity is usually unrelated to problems of the gastrointestinal system.85~86 The long-term follow-up of NEC following surgical resection is less optimistic than the results after medical treatment. Both mortality and morbidity are increased among infants with more severe NEC. Very small infants often require long-term ventilation therapy, which increases the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. There is a delayed mortality of 10% to 25% in these complicated cases. This mortality relates to late-onset sepsis, respiratory failure, cardiopulmonary arrest, congenital anomalies, and TPN-associated hepatic failure (see Table 15 ). Morbidity is associated with cirrhosis, infections, and rickets. This sequence of prolonged, chronic neonatal illness resulted in significant developmental delay among the patients who had stage IIIB NEC.85j86 FUTURE DIRECTIONS We can estimate that between 2,000 and 4,000 premature infants develop NEC each year. Neonatal NEC has been listed immediately after BDS as a significant cause of death in the NICU.27 Today we continue to discuss the role of intestinal ischemia, enteric feeding practices, and microbiologic agents as part of a purported triad for the pathogenesis of NEC. Nonetheless, after years of investigation, the relative importance of each of these factors remains unknown. There is also a paucity of accurate diagnostic tests to determine if a patient has NEC. This is because we often do not detect the short- NEC. In addition, epidemics of NEC often vary in severity. Some epidemics are associated with severe disease, while others only consist of patients with stage IIA disease and a few patients progressing to intestinal necrosis and gangrene. Mortality during epidemics will be quite low when NEC occurs, as benign pneumatosis coli and mortality will be high during epidemics of NEC manifested as shock, intestinal perforation, and septicemia. Chronic sequelae are a good assessment of the morbidity of NEC41 (Tables 13 and 14) . One of the most common late complications of NEC is intestinal strictureg7 Stricture formation may begin during the acute phase of the disease (see section on pathology of NEC) and is most often seen in the terminal ileum or colon, which are also the areas most often involved with the acute mucosal event.g7P \" Strictures may be seen in medically or surgically managed patients and may be unifocal or multiple (see Fig 9) . Overall, between 10% and 22% of survivors of NEC develop intestinal strictures. Universal screening with barium enema in all infants with NEC may \"produce\" the higher frequency. Nonetheless, this method may detect nonobstrutting strictures that would never have produced clinical signs. Obstipation, hematochezia, vomiting, and abdominal distention are common signs of stricture contraction and severe obstruction. These events are due to scarring and usually become evident 2 to 8 weeks after the acute onset of NEC. In addition to presenting with signs of obstruction, strictures may also present as recurrent rectal bleeding. This is a more common event than previously recognized. As part of the evaluation of post-NEC rectal bleeding we have demonstrated active bleeding from ulcers at the base of the stricture by proctosigmoidoscopy.",

Added to these complications are those of prolonged hospitalization and the mechanical and infectious risks of central venous catheterization for TPN41 (see Table 14 ). In the term infant, intestinal length is approximately 200 cm. The smallest reported length of intestine compatible with enteric alimentation is 15 cm with an intact ileocecal valve and 20 cm without the ileoecal valve. Cooper and colleagues43 reviewed their experience with acquired short bowel syndrome in infancy. Neonatal NEC was the most common cause of short bowel syndrome. Survival was 81% overall, and survivors had 44 cm of small intestine vs. 30 cm in nonsurvivors. Causes of death were predominantly related to TPN-associated cholestasis and not specifically due to short bowel syndrome .4*J 43 Survivors required 13 months to be weaned from TPN to full enteric feeding. Although they are experimental procedures, other authors have tried bowel-lengthening methods and colonic interposition or bowel reversal operations to decrease transit time and improve the success rate of enteric alimentation.",

This syndrome occurs because the colonic absorptive capacity for fluid and electrolytes is bypassed by the ileostomy-colostomy procedure. We currently recommend that all infants with surgically treated NEC undergo rean-astomosis prior to discharge from the hospital to avoid rehospitalization for severe diarrhea and dehydration.",

            "text": "Long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up studies of patients with NEC who do not develop the chronic sequelae of short bowel syndrome, cholestatic jaundice, or other hyperalimentatioh complications are very encouragir& \"I lgf3 (Table 15 ). Uncomplicated cases of NEC have an excellent long-term prognosis, which is basically similar to that of their peer group of low-birth-weight infants. Often the common diseases of prematurity, such as asphyxia, BUS, and intraventricular hemorrhage, are more significant in predicting neurodevelopmental outcome than the occurrence of NEC. Moderate to severe neurologic impairment with late morbidity is usually unrelated to problems of the gastrointestinal system.85~86 The long-term follow-up of NEC following surgical resection is less optimistic than the results after medical treatment. Both mortality and morbidity are increased among infants with more severe NEC. Very small infants often require long-term ventilation therapy, which increases the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. There is a delayed mortality of 10% to 25% in these complicated cases. This mortality relates to late-onset sepsis, respiratory failure, cardiopulmonary arrest, congenital anomalies, and TPN-associated hepatic failure (see Table 15 ). Morbidity is associated with cirrhosis, infections, and rickets. This sequence of prolonged, chronic neonatal illness resulted in significant developmental delay among the patients who had stage IIIB NEC.85j86 FUTURE DIRECTIONS We can estimate that between 2,000 and 4,000 premature infants develop NEC each year. Neonatal NEC has been listed immediately after BDS as a significant cause of death in the NICU.27 Today we continue to discuss the role of intestinal ischemia, enteric feeding practices, and microbiologic agents as part of a purported triad for the pathogenesis of NEC. Nonetheless, after years of investigation, the relative importance of each of these factors remains unknown. There is also a paucity of accurate diagnostic tests to determine if a patient has NEC. This is because we often do not detect the short- lived or fleeting appearance of pneumatosis intestinalis. Even when present, this radiographic sign is not consistently identified from the same x-ray by more than one observer.",
