Physicians will have critical roles in diagnosis, containment and treatment of influenza, and their commitment to treat despite increased personal risks is essential for a successful public health response. The obligations of the medical profession stem from the unique skills of its practitioners, who are able to provide more effective aid than the general public in a medical emergency. The free choice of profession and the societal contract from which doctors derive substantial benefits affirm this commitment. In hospitals, the duty will fall upon specialties that are most qualified to deal with an influenza pandemic, such as critical care, pulmonology, anesthesiology and emergency medicine. It is unrealistic to expect that this obligation to treat should be burdened with unlimited risks. Instead, risks should be minimized and justified against the effectiveness of interventions. Institutional and public cooperation in logistics, remuneration and psychological/ legal support may help remove the barriers to the ability to treat. By stepping forward in duty during such a pandemic, physicians will be able to reaffirm the ethical center of the profession and lead the rest of the healthcare team in overcoming the medical crisis.",

Arguments that rationalized the abandonment of patients in previous epidemics include futility when medicine is powerless to help and the depletion of finite resources when physicians fall ill [3] . If obligations can be legitimized, however, and if the medical profession as a whole does have a societal duty, then to which individuals within the profession does this responsibility fall? Some limits in the level of risk will be needed for these obligations to be practically binding, and society will need to question the extent to which doctors have to endanger their lives for public good. There will inevitably be reciprocal demands on society by such physicians who face a disproportionate burden of risks. Barriers to the ability to render aid need to be overcome with the appropriate resources and planning. Standards of care may have to be adjusted and the legal repercussions of these adjusted standards need to be addressed. The present review will confront all these issues in order to aid pandemic planning.",

This increased risk will impact hardest those who work in the frontlines of emergency rooms and primary care. The SARS outbreak showed that a large proportion of the second wave of victims was healthcare workers who were inadvertently infected before the realization of a new infectious disease outbreak [2] . The infection risk to medical professionals therefore becomes part of the baseline risks assumed by all who continue to provide frontline healthcare. After a case definition was established for SARS and infection control was instituted, the transmission among healthcare workers fell precipitously [19] . The infections in the healthcare profession that followed were attributable to either lapse in infection control or to close contact during high-risk pulmonary aerosol-generating procedures [20] . The actual increased risk incurred after the outbreak was identified and the infection control instituted was relatively small. Therefore, pandemic influenza imposes foreseeable high risks to physicians with the potential consequence of mortality. Survey data suggest that 24% of physicians find it acceptable to abandon their workplace during such a pandemic in order to protect themselves and their families [21] . These risks must therefore be significantly mitigated and compensated for by societal and institutional support to ensure adequate turnout of the medical workforce (see Table 1 ).",

Approaching risks with caution is not the same as refusing to treat [22] . International experience with SARS confirms that, with adequate protective equipment, most healthcare professionals continued to turn up for work. Availability of personal protection will reduce ill-conceived heroism whereby doctors fall ill by rushing to treat victims unprotected. These ill doctors will compound the crisis by concurrently increasing the numbers who need treatment and decreasing those who can provide care [5, 12] . Priority to healthcare workers in vaccine and chemoprophylaxis allocation as well as adequate protective equipment is therefore justified by the principles of optimizing effectiveness and maximizing benefits. These reciprocal demands for logistics support by physicians need to be proportional to the extent of risk faced in order to facilitate a just distribution of scarce resources [23] .",

Physicians are not an inexhaustible resource, however, and should weigh the future benefits that a healthy doctor can provide against the good that can be done immediately [25] . Consequently, an influenza pandemic may reach such proportions that expected standards of care may be lowered.
