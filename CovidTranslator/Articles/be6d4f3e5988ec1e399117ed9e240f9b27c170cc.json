TNF-\u03b1 promotes dendritic cell differentiation, 57 leukocyte recruitment, and mediates fever. 3 Antibodies produced by plasma cells help to neutralize the 58 virus, limit infection, and prevent future infections. Disruption of B-cell differentiation into plasma across multiple cytokine axes with immunosuppressants has the potential to 62 increase susceptibility, persistence, and reactivation of viral infections. Immunosuppressants decrease 63 cytokines that recruit and differentiate immune cells needed to clear the infection. Additionally, 64 inflammatory mediators can become hyper-activated resulting in a \"cytokine storm\" which is the 65 primary cause of mortality in severe disease. 2 It is unknown if withdrawal of broadly immunosuppressive 66 therapies may increase the risk of precipitating cytokine storm.
