            "text": "Use of improved methods for health monitoring and housing protects the health of rats and mice in research establishments and improves the quality of research in the laboratories that depend on these animal facilities 1 . There are numerous examples of disease in research animal populations compromising the research results derived from the projects 2 . The presence of mouse hepatitis virus 3 , mouse parvovirus and minute virus of mice 4 , Helicobacter spp. 5 , Mycoplasma pulmonis and Sendai virus 6 and mousepox 7 have all confused research results. Routine monitoring of the prevalence of the various rat and mouse pathogens is useful to the research and laboratory animal community because it allows researchers to assess whether various diseases are increasing or decreasing in importance (in a particular animal population in a particular country). Mice and rats are susceptible to approximately 40 different viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases 2 . Many agents cause severe disease, often resulting in death, but other diseases may be subclinical, maintained in an animal colony for a long period of time or clinically silent, yet affect research results in subtle ways 2 . There is also a risk that infectious agents may contaminate animal products such as cell lines and antibodies. Health monitoring may be expensive, and the knowledge of which diseases are common or rare in a local setting is very useful so that frequency of testing and sample size can be adjusted accordingly. Viral, bacterial and parasitological infections in rats and mice used in biomedical research continue to occur despite improved housing and biosurveillance. The presence of disease in laboratory animals can lead to spurious results for research undertaken in universities, research institutes and the pharmaceutical industry. Here the authors report the results of serological, microbiological, parasitological and molecular tests done on mice and rats from Australasia submitted to a rodent health monitoring laboratory (Cerberus Sciences) from 2004 to 2009. In tested mice, norovirus was the most prevalent virus and ectromelia virus was the least prevalent virus. In tested rats, pneumonia virus of mice was the most prevalent virus and adenoviruses 1 and 2 were the least prevalent viruses. In mice, Helicobacter hepaticus was the most prevalent bacterium, and in rats, Proteus spp. were the most prevalent bacteria. The most common positive helminthological finding in mice and rats was the presence of all pinworms (including Aspicularis spp. and Syphacia spp.). The most common positive protozoan findings in mice and rats were Chilomastix spp. and Trichomonads.",

In addition, the rapid rise in the use of transgenic and knockout mice has resulted in greater numbers of immunocompromised animals in research facilities. Transgenic animals are often more susceptible to a greater number of infectious agents than are non-transgenic rodents and are also prone to certain rare diseases 8 . As populations of transgenic rodents grow, it becomes more difficult to eliminate many of these diseases 9 . For these reasons, it is important to monitor immunocompromised populations more frequently using different disease panels than those used for healthy rats and mice.",

The same report identified rat respiratory virus, rat parvoviruses, rat theilovirus (also known as TMEV), Helicobacter spp., P. pneumotropica and pinworms as common pathogens in rats from animal facilities in North America and Europe 10 . We wished to establish whether similar diseases exist in laboratory rats and mice in Australasia. Knowledge about the sensitivity and specificity of the tests used, as well as the predictive value of positive and negative test results, is useful to allow laboratory animal workers to assess the seriousness of the consequences of a positive result 10 . We retrospectively analyzed the serological, microbiological, parasitological and molecular diagnostic data from approximately 1,000 laboratory mice and rats submitted from academic, industrial and government institutions in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore to this laboratory (Cerberus Sciences, a rodent health monitoring company) each year from 2004 to 2009.",

Mice were seropositive for mouse hepatitis virus, rotavirus, minute virus of mice, mouse adenovirus, reovirus and mouse cytomegalovirus, and the presence of Taenia taeniaformis, Syphacia oblevata and Vampirolepsis spp. was detected. These results were similar to those in another report, which additionally detected M. pulmonis, Sendai virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and parvovirus in wild mice 32 . The seroprevalence of mouse cytomegalovirus is far greater in wild populations (61.7%) 33 than in our study (0.02%). In a serological survey of virus infection among wild house mice (Mus domesticus) in the UK, mice were seropositive for mouse hepatitis virus, mouse cytomegalovirus, mouse thymic virus, mouse adenovirus, mouse parvovirus and minute virus of mice 34 . Testing of rodent-borne pathogens carried by wild-caught Norway rats in the US detected antibodies against rat coronavirus, M. pulmonis, cilia-associated respiratory bacillus, rat parvovirus, Kilham rat virus, Toolan's H-1 virus, Sendai virus and TMEV 35 . These reports suggest that many of the pathogens that remain problematic for laboratory rodents are also encountered in wild mice and rats.",
