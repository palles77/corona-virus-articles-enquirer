            "text": "The global spread of emergent diseases is inevitably entangled with the structure of the population flows among different geographical regions. The airline transportation network in particular shrinks the geographical space by reducing travel time between the world's most populated areas and defines the main channels along which emergent diseases will spread. In this paper, we investigate the role of the large-scale properties of the airline transportation network in determining the global propagation pattern of emerging diseases. We put forward a stochastic computational framework for the modeling of the global spreading of infectious diseases that takes advantage of the complete International Air Transport Association 2002 database complemented with census population data. The model is analyzed by using for the first time an information theory approach that allows the quantitative characterization of the heterogeneity level and the predictability of the spreading pattern in presence of stochastic fluctuations. In particular we are able to assess the reliability of numerical forecast with respect to the intrinsic stochastic nature of the disease transmission and travel flows. The epidemic pattern predictability is quantitatively determined and traced back to the occurrence of epidemic pathways defining a backbone of dominant connections for the disease spreading. The presented results provide a general computational framework for the analysis of containment policies and risk forecast of global epidemic outbreaks.",

All these factors have led to sophisticate modeling approaches including social structures, heterogeneous connectivity patterns, metapopulation grouping, stochasticity and, more recently, to numerical approaches relying on agent based modeling that recreate entire populations and their dynamics at the scale of the single individual (Chowell et al., 2003; Eubank et al., 2004) . In many cases, however, system complexity is not the same as the mere addition of complicated elements accounted for in sophisticate epidemic modeling (Ferguson et al., 2003) . Complex features often imply a virtual infinite heterogeneity of the system and large-scale statistical fluctuations (Albert and Barab\u00e1si, 2000; Amaral et al., 2000; Dorogovtsev and Mendes, 2003; Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2003) , which generally call for new theoretical frameworks and models (Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001; Lloyd and May, 2001; Meyers et al., 2005) .",

Similar modeling approaches, even if limited by a very partial knowledge of the world-wide transportation network, have been used to reproduce specific outbreaks such as pandemic influenza (Longini, 1988; Grais et al., 2003 Grais et al., , 2004 , HIV (Flahault and Valleron, 1991) , and very recently SARS (Hufnagel et al., 2004) , with results in reasonable agreement with experimental data. The availability of the complete world-wide airport network dataset (WAN) and the recent extensive studies of its topology (Barrat et al., 2004; Guimer\u00e0 et al., 2005) are finally allowing a full-scale computational study of global epidemics. In particular we are now in the position to rationalize the role of the large-scale properties of the airline transportation network in the heterogeneity and predictability of the epidemic pattern.",

A first input in the computational approach is the complete International Air Transport Association (IATA) 2 database, allowing an unprecedented level of detail in the study of the evolution of the spatiotemporal pattern of the epidemics. A second important input is given by the populations obtained from various sources and census of all cities associated to airports. The main result of the network analysis is that the WAN is highly heterogeneous both in the connectivity pattern and the traffic capacities. In particular the presence of broad statistical distributions and non-linear associations among the various quantities, contrary to linear relations used so far, might have a major impact in the ensuing disease spreading pattern. While previous studies have in general focused on the simulation and reproduction of case studies of real epidemics, the large-scale modeling allowed by the IATA database enables us to address more general theoretical issues such as (i) the spatiotemporal statistical properties of the epidemic pattern, (ii) their relation with the complex features of the underlying transportation network and (iii) the predictability of the epidemic evolution with respect to the inherent stochastic dynamics of the disease transmission.",

            "text": "The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the general modeling framework. We define the basic compartmental assumption used to describe the populations and the stochastic Langevin formulation of the epidemic dynamics within each city. We also define the stochastic transport operator defining the traveling of individuals among cities. In Section 3 we derive the set of formal equations describing the evolution of the global epidemic outbreaks by coupling the infection dynamics within cities with the action of the transport operator. The various sources of stochasticity, the general integration procedure and the input provided by the IATA network and population data are explained in detail, yielding the computational framework used to obtain the epidemic outbreak forecast. In Section 4 we implement the developed computational approach to the specific case of a susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) infection dynamics. We show how it is possible to obtain a detailed study of the quantities customarily tracked in epidemiological studies and provide a global analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution of the epidemic pattern. The rather heterogeneous spatiotemporal pattern emerging during the epidemic evolution might find its origin in one or more features of the underlying network as well as in the inherent stochastic dynamics of the disease transmission. In order to discriminate the various effects we introduce in Section 5 an entropic measure of the spatial disorder of the epidemic prevalence. In particular the key role of the transportation network is evidenced by comparing the results obtained in the WAN with those generated in network models representing different null hypotheses. The network structure appears to have a major effect in driving the epidemic evolution, therefore allowing the possibility of predicting an overall epidemic pattern on top of the stochastic fluctuations. Motivated by these findings, in Section 6 we investigate the predictability of the epidemic spread through the analysis of the statistical overlap of the epidemic pattern generated in different stochastic realizations of the spreading process. This overlap is quantitatively defined by using a statistical similarity analysis of the global distribution of infected individuals. Also in this case the comparison of different null hypothesis for the network topology and the real-world IATA network allows the determination of the main structural features affecting the predictability of the epidemic scenario. Finally, we conclude in Section 7 by providing an outlook on further open questions and the possible implementation of the presented framework for epidemic forecast and the assessment of containment policies.",

By definition it follows that N j = m X [m] j (t). The dynamics of individuals in each class is determined by two elements. Individuals may move from city j to city by means of the airline transportation network and can change compartment because of the infection dynamics, similarly to the models in Rvachev and Longini (1985) , Flahault and Valleron (1991) , and Grais et al. (2003) and to the stochastic generalization of Hufnagel et al. (2004) .

More precisely, each direct flight connection between airports j and has a weight w j which is the number of available seats. The resulting world-wide air-transportation network (WAN) is therefore a weighted graph comprising V = 3880 vertices denoting airports and E = 18810 weighted edges accounting for the presence of a direct flight connection. The average degree (number of connections of each airport) of the network is k = 2E/V = 9.70, while the maximal degree is 318. This dataset has been complemented by the population N j of the large metropolitan area served by the airports as obtained by publicly available census databases on the WWW (such as the United Nations census 3 or the US census. 4 ) The obtained network displays high levels of heterogeneity both in the connectivity pattern and in the traffic capacities, where the traffic T j of a node j is defined as the sum of the weights of the links starting from j",

The degree probability distribution P(k) = n(k)/V, where n(k) is the number of airports with k connections (i.e. of degree k), is broadly distributed with a degree range covering almost two decades, and can be approximated (Guimer\u00e0 et al., 2005 ) by a power-law with exponent close to 2. Moreover, weights and traffic display a strong heterogeneity revealed by very broad distributions P(w) and P(T) spanning more than 5 orders of magnitude. It is clear that such large heterogeneities will have a strong impact on any dynamical process-in particular spread of epidemicstaking place on the considered network. Finally, to each airport corresponds a city whose population N is heavy-tailed distributed in agreement with the general result of Zipf's (1949) law for city size. Strikingly, these quantities appear to have non-linear relations among them. The traffic T handled by each airport varies with the corresponding number of connections k as a power law T \u223c k \u03b2 with exponent \u03b2 1.5 (Barrat et al., 2004) . The city population and the traffic handled by the corresponding airport obey the non-linear relation N \u223c T \u03b1 with \u03b1 0.5 in contrast with the linear behavior assumed in previous studies (Hufnagel et al., 2004) . Numerical simulations will consider the 3100 airports with highest traffic T, which are complemented by population data of the corresponding urban area. This fraction corresponds to 80% of the total number of airports and carries more than 99% of the total traffic. It is worth noticing that in such a heterogeneous frame, it is very important to take into account as much as possible the fluctuations and large-scale variability of the world-wide airport network. Considering small subsets of the network leads to serious approximations on the structure of the network. 5 (Zipf, 1949) .

Indeed, pandemic influenza killed millions of people world-wide throughout this century (1918, 1957 and 1968 ) and the occurrence of a new outbreak has to be expected. Pandemic influenza spreads rapidly and substantial transmission occurs before the onset of case-defining symptoms. In the following we adopt a minimal model for a pandemic spread with the aim of understanding the effect of the underlying air-transportation network structure on the general properties of the spatiotemporal outbreak pattern. We use the very simplistic approximation of the SIR dynamics in which a fully mixed population is assumed within each city. A refined modeling would include additional aspects such as detailed information about contact networks, age structure, seasonal effects, stages of infection of the specific disease. However, our study aims at the discussion of the general statistical properties of the global spreading and the role of the transportation network heterogeneity in the disease spreading. From this point of view, while we provide the most possible details on the transportation network, we make use of the minimal SIR model in order to provide a general discussion that is not hindered by the use of very complicate disease transmission mechanisms. Specific results of the present computational approach in the case of realistic disease transmission and the comparison with real case studies will be reported elsewhere.",

At first instance, it is possible to monitor standard epidemiological quantities such as the level of infected individuals, the morbidity and the prevalence at different granularity levels; i.e. country, state or administrative regions. The values of the disease parameters \u03b2 and \u00b5 have been chosen according to (Grais et al., 2004) to ensure biologically sound values and kept constant during the evolution. This amounts to assume that no restrictions on traveling and targeted prophylaxis measure are implemented during the outbreak. In this perspective, it is worth remarking that the presented results have to be considered just in a theoretical perspective. We performed several different realizations of the noise for an epidemic outbreak starting from a given initially infected city. A sensitivity analysis of the model respect to the initial conditions has been performed by specifying different origins of the pandemic outbreak, namely Hong Kong, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and London. Moreover, global properties have been studied by averaging over different initially infected cities. Figure 2 shows the profiles of the prevalence, defined as the fraction of infected individuals, restricted to the World continents (with America split in North America and Latin America) for an epidemics starting in Hong Kong. The maximal dispersion as obtained with different realizations of the noise is shown for each continent. Differences can be noted in the time evolution of the epidemics in different regions of the World. Figure 3 A shows the arrival time of the infection for each continent. Starting from Asia, the infection is very soon detected in Europe, North America and Oceania, which are connected to the initially infected city through direct flight connections carrying a large traffic, and much later in Africa and Latin America. The epidemic peak is first reached in Oceania (see Fig. 3B ) followed by North America, Europe, Asia and Africa. The maximum of the prevalence is much more delayed in Latin America with respect to other continents since it is the last one to be infected.",

The color code is the same adopted for the maps. influenza surveillance regions 6 which are identical to the nine divisions of the US census. Two different visualization strategies are used for both the US and Europe. In the first set of maps, regions are drawn with their original size and a color code gives the prevalence of the infection in each region. This representation readily shows the high heterogeneity of the pandemic evolution. While useful, such a visualization might be misleading, since the same prevalence obtained in different regions might correspond to very different values in the number of infected individuals if the two regions are very differently populated. Moreover, it is common to Fig. 5 Geographical representation of the evolution in Europe of the SIR epidemics starting in Hong Kong. The color code corresponds to the prevalence in each European country, from 0 to the maximum value reached (\u03c1 max ). The first set of maps provides the original maps of Europe, while the second shows the corresponding cartograms obtained by rescaling each country according to its population (Gastner and Newman, 2004) . Three representations of the airport network restricted to Europe are also shown, corresponding to three different snapshots of the epidemic diffusion. For the sake of visualization, only the 100 airports with largest traffic in Europe are shown, however the data have been obtained by using the full data set including 3100 airports. The color code is the same adopted for the maps. find strong heterogeneities in the population density, and it is not easy to detect visually a large level of contamination in a small but densely populated geographical area. In order to obtain a geographical representation which is able to carry at the same time information both on the level of infection and on the number of infection cases in each region, we have constructed the corresponding cartograms of the original maps in which the size of each geographic region-influenza surveillance regions in the US and countries in Europe-is rescaled according to its population. Several methods for constructing cartograms have been developed (see Gastner and Newman, 2004 , and references therein); here we adopt the diffusion-based method (Gastner and Newman, 2004) , which produces cartograms by equalizing the population density through a linear diffusion process. This method depicts simultaneously both the prevalence and the total number of cases and conveys properly the impact in terms of infection cases despite the strong heterogeneities in population density. The obtained maps strengthen the evidence of a very heterogeneous pattern of the epidemic evolution. Countries and states show different levels of prevalence following a diverse temporal pattern. The differences in the epidemic peaks that we observe at the continental granularity are present at the country and state level. While the visual inspection provides a very intuitive evidence for the complex evolution of the epidemics, we still lack a quantitative analysis of the epidemic pattern. This is particularly relevant if we aim at connecting the observed epidemic evolution with the underlying transport network structure and the stochasticity of the infection transmission.",

A typical instance of a random graph is thus obtained, characterized by a Poissonian degree distribution, peaked around the average value k and decreasing faster than exponentially at large degree values, in strong contrast with the true degree distribution of the WAN. Moreover, the weights of the links and the city populations are taken as uniform and equal to their average values in the WAN. The second network model (HETw) is again characterized by a homogeneous connectivity pattern, but has heterogeneous traffic values between airports. In particular, the weights are distributed according to the same skewed distribution P(w) as in the real case. To the urban area surrounding each airport we assign a population value as obtained from the non-linear relation found in the WAN between the traffic T handled by each airport and its population N, i.e. T \u221d N \u03b1 with \u03b1 0.5. Finally, for the third model (HETk), we consider the real topology of the WAN, but weights and populations are taken uniform and equal to the average values w and N obtained from the distributions of the WAN, P(w) and P(N), respectively.

This phase is much longer for the network models characterized by a homogeneous degree distribution-HOM and HETw-than for the real airport network.

A similar picture is obtained when considering HETw, i.e. a network characterized by a homogeneous connectivity pattern, but with traffic capacities and populations which are broadly distributed. We observe a different scenario for topologically heterogeneous networks where H is significantly smaller than one for most of the time, with long tails signaling a long lasting heterogeneity of the epidemic behavior. The previous analytical inspection of the deterministic epidemic equations has shown that the broad variability of the contact pattern (degree distribution) and w j /N j play an important role in the heterogeneity of the spreading pattern. Strikingly, networks sharing the same connectivity pattern, but with remarkably different traffic and population distributions (such as HOM/HETw or HETk/WAN), display very similar entropic profiles. Moreover, differences in the nature of the degree distribution of the underlying network lead to clearly different results in the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the spreading pattern, thus pointing out that the broad distribution of degrees of the airport network represents a crucial feature in determining the overall properties of the epidemic pattern.",

Indeed, even when global quantities have small fluctuations from one stochastic realization to another, the infected cities might be very different, thus resulting in a very different epidemic scenario. This is a basic issue of global epidemic modeling since the reliability of any epidemic forecast depends on the fact that any given stochastic realization is reasonably similar to the average prediction or, in other words, that any two given stochastic realizations follow similar evolutions. A quantitative measure of the predictability of the epidemic pattern is therefore given by the statistical similarity of the history of epidemics outbreaks starting with the same initial conditions and subject to different noise realizations. A convenient quantity to monitor in this case is the vector \u03c0(t) whose components are \u03c0 j (t) = I j (t)/ l I l ; i.e the normalized probability that an infected individual is in city j. The similarity between two outbreaks realizations is quantitatively measured by the statistical similarity of two realizations (denoted by I and I I) of the global epidemic characterized by the vectors \u03c0 I and \u03c0 I I respectively. There are many possible measures of distributional similarity and we consider here the Hellinger affinity which leads to the similarity sim H ( \u03c0 I , \u03c0 I I ) = j \u03c0 I j \u03c0 I I j .",

While in the following we will report results obtained with the Hellinger distance, we have measured for completeness also another similarity based on the Jensen-Shannon entropy (Wong and Yao, 1987; Lee, 1999) which leads to nearly identical results confirming the independence of our results with respect to the choice of the similarity measure. These normalized similarities measures do not however account for the difference in the total epidemic prevalence. Indeed, normalized partition of infected individuals differing only of a multiplicative factor will generate the same vector \u03c0. It is thus necessary to consider as well the quantity sim( i I , i I I ) where i = (i, 1 \u2212 i) and i(t) is the worldwide epidemic prevalence j I j (t)/N , with N = j N j . This vector takes into account the similarity of the global prevalence in two stochastic realizations. The overlap function between two different stochastic realizations of an epidemic with the same starting initial conditions and disease parameters is therefore defined as (t) = sim H ( i I (t), i I I (t)) \u00d7 sim H ( \u03c0 I (t), \u03c0 I I (t)).",

The evolution of the overlap during the epidemic spread is shown in Fig. 13 for the various null models and for the WAN. In the HOM and HETw case, we find an impressively large overlap ( > 80%) even at the early stage of the epidemicsthe most relevant phase for early detection. The picture is different if we consider the HETk and the real airport network where two distinct behaviors emerge depending on the degree of the initial infected city. In the case of poorly connected initial cities the overlap is above 80% and decreases only at the very end of the epidemics reflecting the fact that the epidemic behavior is initially constrained to move along the few connections of the starting city, providing an imprint of the outbreak evolution. On the contrary, initial cities with a hub airport generate realizations whose overlap initially decreases to 50-60% (up to 20% in the HETk): the possibility of a wider range of possible channels for the epidemic diffusion results in a larger differentiation of the epidemic history in each stochastic realization. By comparing HETk with the real case-i.e. networks which share the same connectivity pattern but have different traffic distributions-we observe a higher predictability at the early stage of the epidemics in the WAN than in the null model with homogeneous traffic. The comparison of the overlap results obtained for networks with connectivity pattern of different nature but with same traffic capacities-HOM/HETk or HETw/WAN-clearly shows the effect of large degree fluctuations in decreasing the predictability of the epidemic pattern, while the emergence of a backbone of dominant connections given by highly heterogeneous weights is evident in the increase of the overlap values obtained for WAN and HETw compared to HETk and HOM, respectively. We can thus conclude at this stage that the observed behaviors are the result of the balance between two competitive trends. On the one hand, the topological heterogeneity tends to lower the predictability of the global spread of a disease by providing several possible Fig. 13 Predictability of the epidemics spread as measured by the average overlap and corresponding standard deviations (obtained with 5 \u00d7 10 3 couples of different realizations) versus time. We observe two different behaviors depending on the degree of the initially infected city. The initial decrease of the overlap is larger in the case of airport hubs (left column) compared to poorly connected cities (right column) where few spreading channels are available. We also report the prevalence profile as a function of time showing that the maximum predictability corresponds to the prevalence peak. channels for the travels of infected individuals. On the other hand, the heterogeneity in the traffic handled by each airport contributes to increase the predictability of the epidemic diffusion by identifying emerging epidemic pathways, i.e. main spreading channels for the spreading disease.",

For instance, epidemics that reach a large value of infected individuals are less prone to fluctuations and have a large predictability. For the same reason, it is possible to see that the overlap peak is usually associated with the prevalence peak. On the other hand, the initial and late stage of the epidemics are naturally less predictable and prone to stochastic effects. Finally, the time variability of epidemic parameters due to vaccination and control measure are obviously important factor that might change the overall predictability. The mathematical tools developed here are therefore providing a probe to assess the epidemic forecast reliability that may be used on each case and specific infection scenario.",

In this perspective, the complex features characterizing this network are the sources of the heterogeneous and seemingly erratic spreading on a global scale of diseases such as SARS. We have also shown that it is possible to obtain quantitative measurements of the predictability of epidemic patterns by providing a tool that might be used to obtain confidence intervals in epidemic forecast and in the risk analysis of containment scenarios. In addition, we were able to relate different levels of predictability with two conflicting effects: on the one hand, the dominant traffic flows which define the main channels of epidemic spreading-the \"epidemic pathways\"; on the other hand, the underlying heterogeneous connectivity pattern leading to a multiplicity of possible channels. Obviously, in order to make the forecast more realistic, it is necessary to introduce more details in the disease dynamics. Moreover, seasonal effects and geographical heterogeneity in the basic transmission rate (due to different hygienic conditions and health care systems in different countries) should be addressed. Finally, the interrelation of the air transportation network with other transportation systems such as railways and highways could be very useful for forecast on longer time scales. We believe that large-scale mathematical models that take fully into account the complexity of the transportation matrix can be used to obtain detailed forecast of emergent disease outbreaks. This first general and theoretical study thus opens the path to further works including historical case studies of specific diseases such as the SARS, the influenza, etc, and the detailed forecast of future epidemic scenarios.

Considering only two-legs travel, and neglecting the of passengers traveling from city j to city as a sum of different contributions (see Fig. A.1 ): the first one, denoted w (1) j , corresponds to passengers taking a one leg flight from j to ; another contribution, w(2) j , comes from passengers departing from j and transiting in for a connecting flight towards another final destination m ; finally, a last term has to take into account passengers departing from an airport m neighbor of j, transiting in j and finally reaching their destination . For each m neighbor of j, this last term is thus proportional to w(2) mj and to the probability w j /T j that passengers from m take in j a flight towards . Finally we obtainWe can assume that the number of passengers in transit in is a small fraction \u03b1 of the total traffic between j and : w(2) j = \u03b1w j . We then obtain the expression for one leg travel passengers from j to :We now derive the expression for the transport operator with the inclusion of two legs traveling. For the sake of simplicity we will present the derivation for the average transport operator. for a given city j, passengers of a category X can leave j either through one-leg or two-leg traveling, with respective probabilities p(1)j /N j . This gives an average outflowOn the other hand, passengers of category X arriving to j can come either directly from neighbors of j, with probability p(1) j , or arrive from farther nodes m after a transit through these neighbors. The average influx can thus be written asFinally the average full transport operator for city j, including two-leg travels, reads ",
