In Mongolia, the site of some of the world's largest epizootics of equine influenza A(H3N8) virus (EIV) infection, transmission of this virus is sustained among 2.1 million free-ranging horses, causing significant economic losses among rural herders.

However, only 1 genetic sequence from this outbreak among camels is available in Gen-Bank: A/camel/Mongolia/1982/H1N1. Despite reports of serologic activity against influenza A virus among camels in several African countries (7, 8) , the lack of isolated virus from these populations highlights how little is known about the ecology of influenza viruses in camels. Questions about the potential role of camels in human cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (9) further highlight our lack of knowledge of infectious diseases in camels and the merits of increased surveillance at this unique human-animal interface.",

Without additional isolates from camels or corresponding epidemiologic data, and given the close genetic relationship between A/camel/Mongolia/335/2012 and related equine viruses, it is impossible to determine at this time whether the virus has been successfully transmitted from camel to camel. In recent years, enhanced surveillance has detected influenza A viruses across a wider range of mammalian hosts, including horses, swine, dogs (14) , seals (15) , cats, and now camels, providing a more complete picture of the ecology of influenza A viruses beyond their presence in birds. How influenza A viruses successfully jump from 1 host species to another, and what the constraints on interspecies transmission are, remain key questions about influenza virus ecology and assessments of pandemic threats. Our findings highlight the need to further elucidate the ecology of influenza viruses and other pathogens in freeranging camel populations.",

McKenzie) DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2012.140435Only 1 specimen was confirmed positive by influenza Aspecific qRT-PCR (cycle threshold [C t ]<35), suggesting possible virus degradation during shipment, despite specimens being shipped on dry ice and carefully handled upon receipt(10). The original swab specimen from a camel was later shared with the Mongolia National Influenza Center for confirmation in an anonymized panel of 10 camel swab specimens. Using WHO qRT-PCR procedures, staff identified the specimen as having the strongest evidence (by C t ) of influenza A virus. Staff further studied the specimen with conventional RT-PCR primers and probes for the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genomes. These reactions yielded amplicons of the expected size, which were sequenced and found to be 100% identical to the corresponding portions of the J. Craig Venter Institute (Rockville, MD, USA) sequences described below.Sanger sequence data for the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of this isolate demonstrated extremely high levels of identity with recent EIV from Asia isolated under this project in 2011(4). Full-genome sequencing of the 8 genome segments amplified by multisegment RT-PCR(11) was performed at the J. Craig Venter Institute by using Ion Torrent PGM technology (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) with a 314v2 chip, and the sequences were validated by using the MiSeq platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Full-genome sequence data for this virus, named A/camel/Mongolia/335/2012(H3N8), were deposited in GenBank (accession nos. CY164120.1, CY164121.1, CY164122.1, CY164123.1, CY164124.1, CY164125.1, CY164126.1 and CY164127.1).

All 8 viral genome segments (polymerase basic protein [PB] 2, PB1, polymerase acidic protein (PA), hemagglutinin (HA) , nucleocapsid protein (NP), neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein (MP), and nonstructural protein (NS) are closely related to the equine influenza A(H3N8) viruses that have recently been circulating among the horse population in Asia; this lineage is evolutionarily distinct from the influenza A(H3N8) viruses circulating among birds in Asia (online Technical AppendixFigures 1-7, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/ EID/article/20/12/14-0435-Techapp1.pdf). A more detailed phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin segment performed by using the additional background sequence data representing the global diversity of influenza A(H3N8) viruses in horses indicates that A/camel/Mongolia/335/2012 is positioned within Florida clade 2 (FC2)(Figure 2)(13) and, more specifically, within a bootstrap-supported clade that contains 3 influenza A(H3N8) viruses isolated fromhorses in Mongolia in 2011: A/equine/Mongolia/6/2011 (100% nt similarity), A/equine/Mongolia/56/2011 (99.9% nt similarity), and A/equine/Mongolia/3/2011 (100% nt similarity).
