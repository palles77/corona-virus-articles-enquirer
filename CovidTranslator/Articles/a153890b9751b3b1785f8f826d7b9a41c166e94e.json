Synthesis of those molecules is a challenging task as most of the reactions developed for the synthesis of nonfluorinated ones can't be transposed directly to fluorinated building blocks.",

In the eighties, Takeuchi studied the synthesis of compounds bearing four different labile groups, including a carbonyl group, halogen, and other heteroatomcontaining groups (nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur) from a-halo-afluoroesters, among which EDBFA. 5 This task turned out to be difficult due to the influence of each functional group on the reactivity of another. The first approach consisted in the electrophilic functionalization of a-fluoroenolates (Li, Na) or enol silyl ethers. However attempts to react them with nitrogen or sulfur electrophiles failed to produce the desired tri-or tetrafunctional compounds, probably because of the presence of multiple labile groups on the same carbon or because of the poor reactivity of the a-fluoroenolate towards heteroaromatic electrophiles. Nucleophilic displacement of one bromine atom using NaSPh, NaSEt, NaOEt, and NaOCH 2 Ph afforded the corresponding reduced products whereas the use of NaN 3 as a nucleophile under phase-transfer conditions led to the corresponding azido derivative 1 in 47% yield (Scheme 1).

The reaction of EDBFA with benzylamine and a variety of secondary amines in the presence of dimethylaluminium chloride led to the corresponding dibromofluoroacetamides 7aef in high yields (Scheme 5).

Reaction of diethylzinc with EDBFA gives rise to a mixture of E-and Z-enolates (see Transition states A and B, Scheme 17). Each of them reacts with the aldehyde via a chair-like transition state to produce, respectively, the zinc aldolate A-I and B-I. Reaction of diethylzinc with aldolate A-I affords the (Z)-afluoroacrylate (Z)-19 via an E2-elimination process, which is permitted because of the antiperiplanar arrangement of the bromine atom and the zinc ethoxy leaving group. In the case of aldolate B-I, the bromine atom and the leaving group are not in an antiperiplanar relationship, which prevents an E2-elimination and consequently the formation of the (E)-a-fluoroacrylate 19. Equilibrium to aldolate B-II would permit the E2-elimination to occur. However, this conformation is excluded because of the destabilizing non-bonding 1,3-diaxial interactions between R 1 and the OEt group. As a consequence, aldolate B-II remains as such in the reaction mixture and provides the syn-a-bromo-a-fluoro-bhydroxyester 10 upon acidic work-up.",

The corresponding a-bromo-afluoro-b-hydroxyesters were not formed under those reaction conditions. a-Fluoroacrylates 19 were isolated from a variety of ketones with moderate to complete selectivity for the (E)-isomer and in moderate to very good yields (Table 2 ). Reverse stereoselectivity was obtained with pinacolone (entry 6) and 4,4dimethyl-2-pentanone (entry 7) because of the inversion of priorities of the substituents. Results show that the stereoselectivity of the reaction depends on the hindrance of the substituents on the ketone (entries 1e4). Indeed, ketones bearing one hindered group led to complete stereoselectivity (entries 3, 4, 6). 19 F NMR spectroscopic analyses were conducted in order to better understand the mechanism of the reaction. It was found that the intermediate syn-a-bromo-a-fluoro-b-hydroxyester was consumed more rapidly than the anti-isomer. Moreover, when the reaction was carried out whether from the syn-or the anti-abromo-a-fluoro-b-hydroxyester, the E/Z ratio of a-fluoroacrylates remained constant, which implies the formation of a common intermediate from each isomer. In case of ketones, a chelation-control model was assumed to explain the stereoselectivity of the process (Scheme 18). Metalation of the syn-and anti-zinc alkoxide 20a and 20b leads to enol intermediate A, which is stabilized by chelation of the Zn (II) center with the oxygen of the alcohol to form a sixmembered ring. Intermediate A can adopt two different conformations A-I and A-II that will deliver the (E)-or the (Z)-a-fluoroacrylates 19. Based on Cancell on mechanism studies about the stereoselective synthesis of substituted acrylates, 36 a general intermediate B was proposed with the larger group (R L ) in the equatorial position and the smaller group (R S ) in the axial one. Hindered groups on the ketones (Table 2 , entries 3, 4, 6) will then adopt the equatorial position leading to the (E)-a-fluoroacrylates 19.",

In 2003, the group of Mioskowski and Falck developed a straightforward diastereoselective Cr(II)mediated olefination starting from commercially available trihaloacetates and aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes. 40 A series of ahaloacrylates have been synthesized in very high yields and with full stereocontrol (>99%) for the (Z)-isomer using CrCl 2 as a mediator. The chromium salt can be used alone in excess (4.5 equiv) or in substoichiometric quantity (50 mol %) in combination with Mn/ TMSCl regeneration system. Ketones are also suitable for this transformation giving high level of diastereoselectivity but moderate yields. Using this methodology, EDBFA was reacted with aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes to afford exclusively the corresponding (Z)-a-fluoroacrylates 19 in very high yields (Scheme 21).",

The reaction was applied to EDBFA with two aliphatic aldehydes (cyclohexanal and sbutanal) to get the corresponding (Z)-a-fluoroacrylates 19 in moderate yields and very high diastereoselectivity (Scheme 22).

Cyclopropane (AE)-34a (from Scheme 27) was further used to synthesize a family of fluorinated constrained analogues of glutamic acid. 58 The family of compounds was tested for the agonist activity towards metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 4 (mGluR4). The nature of the distal acidic function in glutamate analogues being essential to increase both selectivity and affinity for mGlu receptors, 59 the fluorine atom was expected to increase the acidity of the distal function, hence improving the agonist activity. Among all compounds tested, cyclopropane (AE)-(Z)-FAP4 39 (Scheme 29) displayed the best agonist activity and is much more potent (7-times) than its racemic non-fluorinated analogue (E)-APCPr. 60 Calculations of the dissociation constants (using I-lab 2.0 program) showed that, at physiological pH, the phosphonic acid function of (AE)-(Z)-FAP4 39 exists exclusively in dianionic form (pK a3 \u00bc6.0) whereas (AE)-(E)-APCPr exists as a mix of mono-and dianionic phosphonic acid (pK a3 \u00bc6.7). This difference in ionization states might explain the difference of binding of these two compounds with the mGlu4 receptor.",

Diastereoselective and regioselective saponification of the ethyl ester led to the corresponding carboxylic acid (AE)-(Z)-36, which can be separated from the remaining (AE)-(E)-36 ethyl ester derivative (Scheme 29) by a simple acidoebasic extraction. Reduction of the carboxylic acid of (AE)-(Z)-36 to the corresponding alcohol followed by mesylation and iodination led to the iodinated product (AE)-(Z)-37. This latter undergoes a MichaeliseArbuzov reaction using triethylphosphite to afford the corresponding phosphonate (AE)-(Z)-38 in modest yield. Further deprotection under acidic conditions leads to the desired cyclopropane (AE)-(Z)-FAP4 39 in 12% overall yield from the starting cyclopropane (AE)-34a. Unfortunately, this synthetic route currently remains unsuccessful for the E isomer, the MichaeliseArbuzov reaction leading to complete decomposition of the material.",

Those optimal conditions were applied to a series of aldehydes to stereoselectively synthesize (Z)-a-fluoroacrylates 19 and syn-a-bromo-a-fluoro-b-hydroxyesters 10 (Scheme 16). Both aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes bearing a variety of functional groups give good yields of products. a-Fluoroacrylates are always obtained in their pure (Z) form and the syn-a-bromo-a-fluoro-b-hydroxyester is selectively obtained in most cases. However the ratio (Z)a-fluoroacrylate 19/syn-a-bromo-a-fluoro-b-hydroxyester 10 is generally moderate.
