These symptoms usually last for 2 to 7 days and have significant similarities with DENV-like disease. The incubation period of ZIKV is not clear but is likely to range from 3 to 12 days. 18 Only 18% of ZIKV infection cases are reported to be symptomatic, and many individuals might never recognize that they have been infected with ZIKV. 13 Strong evidence now indicates that ZIKV infection can cause severe fetal neurologic malformations, including microcephaly or fetal death (referred to as congenital Zika syndrome). 19, 20 The most severe spectrum of Zika syndrome pathology occurs in the unborn, including musculoskeletal, ocular, craniofacial, genitourinary, pulmonary, and other abnormalities. 21 Zika virus has also been linked to an increased incidence of a potentially lifethreatening GBS (an inflammatory autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nervous system) in adults, as well as other neurologic abnormalities. 22 Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome occurs at a frequency of 1.1 to 1.8 cases per 100,000 people per year and occurs predominantly in older adults. 23 Since the beginning of the ZIKV epidemic in French Polynesia in 2013, the incidence of ZIKV-associated GBS has increased by 20-fold, 24 with 42 patients diagnosed with Zika-associated GBS between November 2013 and February 2014. 25 Presently, Brazil is the most affected country, with estimates of 1.5 million cases of ZIKV infection reported since the outbreak began. 26 nonvector transmission, such as sexual transmission from infected males and mother to child transmission, have been well documented. 28 Zika virus has been detected in bodily fluids (eg, semen, urine, saliva, vaginal fluids, breast milk, and tears) following infection; the longest reported period from symptom onset to detection of ZIKV RNA was 9 months following infection in semen from 184 ZIKVinfected men. 29 Data from the largest cohort study to date revealed that infectious ZIKV RNA shedding in semen declines during the first 3 months after symptom onset. 29 Notably, a recently developed synthetic DNA vaccine encoding ZIKV premembrane/membrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins entirely protected mice against ZIKV-induced testis and sperm damage. 30 New research using pregnant rhesus macaques revealed long-standing persistence of ZIKV in both maternal and fetal tissues, enhanced maternal and fetal immune responses, and fetal inflammation. 31 It is not yet clear if pathologic effects are different or more severe among immunocompromised persons. Given ZIKV pathogenesis and cell and tissue tropism, there is an urgent need to develop Zika vaccines that have the potential to protect the publicdespecially pregnant women and their fetusesdfrom ZIKV infection. 32",

Three main genetic lineages of ZIKV (2 from Africa [African I and African II lineages] and 1 from Asia) have been identified. [33] [34] [35] Genetic analyses indicate that its geographic circulation was limited to the areas around Africa and Asia by the 2000s; ZIKV then evolved into 2 distinct lineages with differential pathogenesisdAfrican (ie, African I lineage) and Asian. [36] [37] [38] A study published in July 2018 by Beaver et al 39 revealed that the African lineages were more virulent than the Asian and induced stronger inflammatory responses. However, it is not clear why neurologic disorders and congenital malformations throughout the Americas are mainly associated with the Asian lineage strains. 40 The Asian strains have been found to activate innate immune interferon (IFN) regulatory factors via NS1, NS4B, and NS5 ZIKV nonstructural proteins while African lineage strains have not, demonstrating evolutionary differences in pathogenesis and molecular responses between Asian and African lineages. 39, 41 The Zika genome is analogous to that of other Flaviviridae RNA viruses (ie, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, tick-borne encephalitis, and dengue type 1-4 viruses) and encodes for 3 major structural proteins (ie, prM, capsid [C] , and E [a primary target of neutralizing antibody development]) and 7 nonstructural proteins (ie, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). Notably, the nonstructural NS5 protein is implicated in RNA synthesis and viral replication. Importantly, the proteins documented to have significance in terms of immune response include nonstructural protein NS5 that has been shown to suppress type I IFN signaling through STAT2mediated degradation in the ZIKVinfected host. 42 During viral shedding, prM is cleaved by furin protein to generate mature infectious virions. Zika virus E protein is the main surface protein that participates in host cell receptor attachment and virus lipid bilayer fusion, while the nonstructural NS1 through NS5 proteins are engaged in virus propagation. Robust adaptive immune responses to ZIKV E, NS1, NS3, NS4B, and NS5 proteins such as production of neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses have been detected in animal models of ZIKV infection, which indicates that vaccination may protect against ZIKV disease.

Given the observation of intermittent outbreaks thus far, the ability to store vaccine stockpiles for long periods of time is also necessary. Such a product profile has yet to be achieved for any vaccine. The WHO has defined a more limited target product profile (Table 1) , at least for a first-generation vaccine product. 47 Vaccine development will also face several challenges, including the lack of an established correlate of protection (in children, adults, and the fetus), current unpredictability and lack of outbreaks, the large number of subclinical infections, the marked variability in clinical manifestations during symptomatic illness, the need to test multiple vulnerable populations, the uncertain effects of prior immunity to ZIKV or other flaviviruses (ie, DENV), and the lack of animal models that recapitulate important features of human disease. 48 These and other factors have been discussed in a recent WHO landscape analysis. 49 Zika Immunology Both type I and type III IFNs are produced in response to ZIKV infection and can limit viral replication. 50 Zika virus proteins can actively inhibit the IFN response during infection. 51 As we learn more details about these virus-host interactions, the results may provide important information regarding appropriate adjuvant selection for vaccine candidates. Many of the animal models used for ZIKV work have defects in innate immune pathways; therefore, results must be interpreted with caution, as they may not reflect what will occur in humans. Nonhuman primate, guinea pig, and chicken embryo models are also being developed, as are models to study vaccine outcomes in pregnancy. 31, [52] [53] [54] [55] Efforts are also under way to develop a controlled human infection model for Zika, much like what has been done with influenza, malaria, and DENV. 56 The adaptive immune response to flaviviruses (including ZIKV) involves both humoral and cell-mediated components. Neutralizing antibody (considered a major contributor to protective immunity) responses target the E protein and are crossreactive with other flaviviruses. [57] [58] [59] This cross-reactivity has been an issue for diagnostic tests in areas where diseases such as dengue fever, West Nile virus, and yellow fever are endemic. In these geographic areas, coinfection with multiple flaviviruses is common and represents a complication in terms of immune response analysis that must be considered during the development and deployment of a ZIKV vaccine. 60 Monoclonal antibody treatment protects mice against infection, 61 and depletion of T cells in previously vaccinated animals does not abrogate protective immunity. 62 These experiments suggest that humoral immunity can protect against disease and that vaccineinduced immunity can be protective. Despite this, there are several questions that remain unanswered: (1) in DENV, suboptimal antibody responses can enhance disease severityda phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), and we do not know if ADE could also be an issue for ZIKV vaccines as it has been in the use of DENV vaccines; (2) vaccine responses are likely to be quite different in individuals who have no prior exposure to Zika or other flaviviruses compared with those with preexisting immunity, and these population groups may require fundamentally different vaccine formulations for both safety and optimal protection; and (3) it is likely that optimal humoral responses to ZIKV will require T-cell help, and a solitary focus on antibody titers as the only immunologic end point may be counterproductive.",

On the negative side, inadequate research funding, late funding given the initial outbreaks in the Yap Islands in 2007, and a variety of difficulties in moving vaccine candidates down the development pipeline, have slowed progress. In particular, governments must invest the research and development dollars and provide industry incentives for rapid clinical development to occur. This must be a shared burden but should particularly have intense and sustained involvement by the countries where mosquito abatement has been \"too little too late\" and where outbreaks of this disease have developed. Additionally, these outbreaks are an excellent example of the need for a global funding entitydas called for in a recent publication. It is likely that in the private sector, the costs of Zika vaccine development cannot be recouped due to the relative lack of current and ongoing largescale outbreaks. Thus, industry will need incentives or government-provided development dollars to invest resources into the multimillion dollar enterprise needed to advance a vaccine candidate through to approval by regulatory authorities.",

Other unknowns include possible further mutational divergence of strains and the development of new Zika clades that may require more than a monotypic vaccine for full protection. Lastly, thoughtful decisions must be made regarding whom and with what priority different groups should receive vaccine, at what ages, and to prevent which outcomes. Other issues such as whether pregnant women can be enrolled in vaccine studies and receive specific vaccine types will need to be debated and considered.",
