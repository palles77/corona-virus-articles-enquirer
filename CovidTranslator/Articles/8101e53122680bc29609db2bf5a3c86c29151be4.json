Population surveys, however, show that the prevalence of asthma in the elderly ranges from 2.4% to 12.2%.lSi 45, 48, 154 In a study comparing late-onset asthma and long-standing disease in nonsmoking elderly asthmatics, Braman et all9 noted that 48% of patients developed asthma after 65 years of age. In a review of 10 population studies, Enright et a145 found the prevalence of asthma to range from 2.4% to 6.6%. Banerjee et als noted that 61% of randomly selected geriatric dayhospital patients exhibited airflow obstruction on pulmonary function testing. Of those with airflow obstruction 41.2% demonstrated greater than 15% improvement in peak expiratory flow rate following inhalation In addition to chronic asthma, the incidence of new cases after 60 years of age appears to remain relatively constant, ranging from two to six cases per thousand. '8,21,22,39 Advances in technology, nutrition, and medicine have set the stage for profound increases in the geriatric populations, such that the over-85 age group is the fastest growing segment of society in North America. 28 Based on current trends, by the year 2020, the over-65 and over-75 age groups will constitute 22% and 14.2% of the populations in the industrialized nations. 30 Thus we can anticipate a sustained increase in geriatric asthmatics requiring care. The principles of managing asthma in elderly patients differ little from those of treating younger patients. The impaired excretion of drugs by the kidney and liver, however, and greater likelihood of comorbid diseases and adverse drug-drug interactions make the management of asthma in elderly patients complex. 178, 196 Infection-related mortality in the elderly is three-to 20-fold higher for given diseases compared with younger patients.h6, 17R Pneumoniaassociated mortality in the elderly ranges from 5.9% to 32.9%, accounting for 89% of all pneumonia and influenza deaths in the United States between 1979 and 1992,29, 60, 83, 111, Iz5 and with influenza is the fifth leading cause of death in patients over 65 years of age.29 A recent 2year prospective observational study of independent elderly individuals reported that 54% of those older than 65 years of age had respiratory tract infections, of which bronchitis, pneumonia, and influenza constituted 42% of the total respiratory infection^.'^^ The severity of lower respiratory tract infections is a function of host susceptibility, the virulence of the infecting agent, and the extent of disease at the start of therapy.",

The respiratory tract immune system is composed of both specific and nonspecific defense mechanisms that consist of a variety of anatomic, neurologic, cellular, and humoral mechanisms. The integrity of these mechanisms, pathogen virulence and the size of the bacterial inoculum play key roles in colonization and subsequent infection of the lower respiratory tract. A variety of conditions contributing to alveolar fluid accumulation place the host at an increased risk of pneumonia. Diminishing host, defenses increase the vulnerability of elderly 'asthmatic patients to more protracted and debilitating consequences of lung infections. Increased vulnerability may also reflect the increased prevalence of diseases associated with fluid retention, such as cardiac, renal, or liver failure, swallowing disorders, altered consciousness, deconditioning due to a sedentary lifestyle, or adverse effects of malnutrition, immunosuppression, or malignancy. Harford and Haras7 demonstrated the harmful effects of increased lung water on the survival of mice with experimental pneumonia. A 15-fold increase in mortality was described in mice inoculated with endobroncheal bacteria, following endobronchial infusion of saline or serum. Effective phagocytosis cannot occur under these conditions in the absence of opsonic antibodies. Disease-related pulmonary dysfunctions associated with an increased frequency of lower respiratory tract infection are as follows41: Chandra= noted that in previously healthy individuals, the presence of anergy, lymphopenia, or both was associated with 1-year survival rates of 72%, 58%, and 45%, respectively. In a 16-year longitudinal study of healthy elderly men, decreased absolute lympocyte counts were noted within 3 years of death.12 The leukopenia, however, was not age dependent and in both of these studies might have served as a marker of more severe comorbid disease(s). In predominately healthy patients with a mean age of 82 years, a normal inflammatory response to pneumonia was noted, as measured by appropriate rise in C-reactive protein, leukocytosis, and a neutrophil degranulation product, plasma neutrophil elastase a-1-antiproteinase ~omplex.~ In addition, despite having measurably lower numbers of cytotoxic T lymphocytes at baseline, elderly patients were able to mount an adequate response following inactivated influenza A virus ~accinati0n.l~~ These results support the notion that the healthy elderly are still able to mount an adequate immune response to pneumonia. Nasopharyngeal colonization with gram-negative bacteria has been reported to increase in elderly patients, but few studies have looked at the elderly living independently within the community.49, 50, 781, ls5 It is likely that the high rates of colonization are more representative of comorbid illnesses and therapy, in addition to the milieu in which these patients reside. The elderly have an increased incidence of bacteremia, urinary tract infection, diverticulitis, pneumonia, infective endocarditis, disseminated fungal infection, and reactivation of tuberc~losis.~~, Although immune dysfunction probably plays a role in these infections, the increased susceptibility of the elderly to infection may in part represent a synergistic effect of comorbid illnesses, nutritional stat~s,l\"~, and age-dependent organ dysfunction.%, 178",

The presence of lung disease and bronchial asthma did not increase the risk of death. Postulated mechanisms by which asthma causes host immune system dysfunction have been reviewed (Table l) .l0, 25, 27, 84, 85, 97, 98, 148, 149 In addition, mucociliary transport may be slowed by as much as 72% during an acute exa~erbation.'~~ Multiple authors have described impaired mucociliary transport in asthmatic patients.'O! 25, 97, Io5, 'I7* 149 In addition, hypogammaglobulinemia was 4.8 times more likely to be identified in unselected asthmatics than in the normal p o p~l a t i o n .~~ Of note, 10 of the 12 patients with hypogammaglobulinemia received a cumulative prednisone dose (or its equivalent) of 2 5 mg/day for at least 2 years. Because asthma in the elderly is less likely to be responsive to conservative therapy, more elderly asthmatics will be at risk of suffering the combined immune-altering effects of age, comorbidity, and immunosuppression.Is In a survey of consecutive geriatric asthmatic patients in their pulmonary practice, Braman et all9 noted that 22 of 25 patients more than 70 years of age required oral steroids in addition to inhaled corticosteroids, highlighting the potential clinical significance of iatrogenic immune deficiencies. The previously described immune host defense dysfunction may be significant, but may be less important than the combined effects of comorbid disease(s). Asthmatic patients more than 65 years of age have been shown to have six-to 10-fold higher mortality than younger patients, partially attributable to complicating illnesses and therapies, but in addition attributable to delays in presentation, increased noncompliance with medications, poor nutrition, and isolated living situations that predispose them to poorer outcomes.18, 34, lS1, 162",

Many studies have attempted to identify historical, clinical, and laboratory parameters by which physicians could appropriately stratify patients with pneumonia with respect to their need for hospitalization and intensive care.17* 54, 61, 83* 120, Farr et a154 reviewed prognostic factors obtained by history that have been associated with death from pneumonia, and they identified 18 studies that showed an association between older age and death. Nine of the studies found an association using univariate analysis, and two studies found an association using multivariate analysis.20, 37 In a recent study evaluating the utility of radiographic presentation of community-acquired pneumonia, the overall mortality rate of patients 65 years of age or older was 10.2% as compared with the 1.8% mortality rate of patients 45 to 64 years of age, further highlighting the risk of age and infection. 83 In a metaanalysis, Fine et aP2 noted 14 cohort studies that evaluated the association of age and mortality, with a mean age difference in survivors versus nonsurvivors of 7.8 years. In the same study, logistic regression analysis performed on 85 cases noted an odds ratio of 1.05 (95% CI, range 1.01-1.09) of death for each 10-year increment in mean patient age. Although this metaanalysis found age to be significantly associated with death, the weight of comorbid illness was not addressed. Studies by Esposito et a1,% Black et al,I7 and Lipsky et a1,120 which corrected for comorbid factors, found that age was not a significant risk factor for mortality. Using retrospectively derived prognostic parameters, Black et all7 noted that ambulatory elderly patients were more likely to be admitted with pneumonia than younger patients. When a multivariate analysis was performed controlling for comorbid conditions, age was no longer predictive.17 In a retrospective case control study, Lipsky et noted dementia, seizure disorders, and institutionalization to be associated with acquiring pneumococcal infections. In the same study, age was not significantly associated with pneumococcal pneumonia when corrected for comorbidities. These observations support the overriding importance of an individual's physiologic status as a determinant for initiating invasive life-saving medical therapy.",

In the prospective phase, three (11%) of 27 patients with pneumonia and 16 (4.7%) of patients with bronchitis had positive serology for C. pneumoniae. Of these 19 infected patients, three (16%) had wheezing with their acute infection, and six (32%) developed bronchospasm during the ensuing 6 months. After controlling for confounding variables, a C. pneumoniae titer of 1:16 or more was associated with an odds ratio of 2.1 (95% CI, range 1.14.2) for developing wheezing. In the matched control phase of the study, 29 .6% of C. pneumoniae-positive patients compared with 7% of controls were diagnosed with asthma, with an odds ratio of 7.2 (95% CI, range 2.2-23.4). This finding was further substantiated by demonstrating a dose-response relationship between titers and the presence of wheezing.

Eighty percent of patients diagnosed with asthma following their illness had a C. pneurnoniae titer of more than or equal to 1:64, and of these six (75%) developed chronic asthma following bronchitis, and one (12.5%) following pneumonia. Asthmatic bronchitis was more likely to occur in older reinfected patients, raising the question whether C. pneumoniae might have exerted an immune-mediated effect on the lung. 73 ,",

In addition, eight of 10 patients experienced a greater than 15% decline in FEV, within 6 hours of the antigen challenge. In a longitudinal study of adult asthmatics 19 to 46 years of age, Nicholson et identified nonbacterial pathogens in 44% of asthma exacerbations associated with cold symptoms. Twenty-four percent of laboratory-confirmed infections were associated with significant airflow obstruction. In this study, viral pathogens accounted for 93% of all infections, of which rhinovirus and coronavirus accounted for the majority.

Although data are lacking in the elderly, epidemiologic studies in younger age groups strongly suggest the causative and provocative roles of infection in asthma. Future evaluation must be performed to better characterize what role viral and bacterial infections have in the geriatric population. As the role of C. pneurnoniae and other infections in asthma is better defined, more specific therapy may be possible. The normal lung defense mechanisms decline with age, but clinical disease and therapeutic strategies are more dependent on organ dysfunction and underlying comorbid diseases. Thus assessment and specific therapy are dependent on an individual's physiologic health rather than chronologic age. For now, selection of therapy should be based on host vulnerability, the epidemiologic risk of infection, the severity of the patient's infection, and the virulence of potential pathogens. Although conceding the importance of antimicrobial therapy once infection occurs, one must continue to stress the importance of good hygiene, adequate nutrition, proper surveillance of the patient's asthma, and more vigilant use of vaccines to prevent infection in asthmatic patients.
