METHODS: Using the Nationwide Readmissions Database (2010-2015), we assessed trends in all-cause readmission rates for 1 of the 3 HRRP conditions (acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, pneumonia) or conditions not targeted by the HRRP in age-insurance groups defined by age group (65 years or <65 years) and payer (Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance). RESULTS: In the group aged 65 years, readmission rates for those covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance decreased annually for acute myocardial infarction (risk-adjusted odds ratio [OR; 95% confidence interval] among Medicare patients, 0.94 [0.94-0.95], among Medicaid patients, 0.93 [0.90-0.97], and among patients with private-insurance, 0.95 [0.93-0.97]); heart failure (ORs, 0.96 [0.96-0.97], 0.96 [0.94-0.98], and 0.97 [0.96-0.99], for the 3 payers, respectively), and pneumonia (ORs, 0.96 [0.96-0.97), 0.94 [0.92-0.96], and 0.96 [0.95-0.97], respectively). Readmission rates also decreased in the group aged <65 years for acute myocardial infarction (ORs: Medicare 0.97 [0.96-0.98], Medicaid 0.94 [0.92-0.95], and private insurance 0.93 [0.92-0.94]), heart failure (ORs, 0.98 [0.97-0.98]: 0.96 [0.96-0.97], and 0.97 [0.95-0.98], for the 3 payers, respectively), and pneumonia (ORs, 0.98 [0.97-0.99], 0.98 [0.97-0.99], and 0.98 [0.97-1.00], respectively). Further, readmission rates decreased significantly for non-target conditions.",

For this study, we included the patients with Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance as the payers of the hospitalization; Medicare and Medicaid both include fee-for-service and managed care patients, and private insurance includes commercial insurance providers. Given the variability in reporting across participating states, only 1 payer is associated with each person in the NRD.

These definitions are consistent with those used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for its readmission metrics for the respective conditions.

To define index hospitalizations for nontarget conditions, we excluded the hospitalizations for the 3 target conditions (acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia). We also excluded hospitalizations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hip and knee arthroplasty because these types were included in the HRRP toward the end of the study period. 10 The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes used to identify each of these conditions are included in Supplementary Tables 1-10 (available online) . We stratified all hospitalizations into age-insurance subgroups defined by age (65 years or <65 years) and insurance payer (Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance). For each of the 4 conditions (acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, pneumonia, and nontarget hospitalizations), there were 6 age-insurance groups based on age and insurance payer: 65 years with Medicare, Medicaid, or",

[11] [12] [13] For risk adjustment, we created a patientlevel survey logistic regression model with 30-day readmission as the outcome and risk factors that are part of the risk adjustment in the CMS publicly reported measure for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia (age, gender, and comorbidities) based on the secondary diagnoses in the index hospitalization as independent variables. For nontarget conditions, we used the set of risk factors that are included in the CMS hospital-wide readmission measure. 14 In contrast to the CMS measures, where risk factors are defined based on the diagnoses in the index hospitalization as well as a preceding 12-month period before the index event, the comorbidities used in our survey logistic regression were defined in the index event. To allow assessment of risk-adjusted odds of readmission over years, we assessed calendar year as a dummy coded continuous variable in the model, allowing for an assessment of odds of annual changes in readmission stratified by the 6 age-insurance groups. To further evaluate the differences in annual trends of readmission between older Medicare and other patient groups, we tested the interaction between the calendar year and age-payer patient groups with Medicare patients aged 65 years as the reference group.",

Some of the structural changes might have been spurred by CMS itself, which has initiated several programs aimed at reducing readmissions. One such program, Hospital Engagement Networks, was established by the CMS Partnership for Patients in 2011 and focuses on patient safety, particularly the prevention of patient harm after discharge. 16 The program operated through dissemination of information and the development of collaborations between hospitals. Hospital to Home is a nationwide initiative to develop resources for hospitals to improve transitions through discharge and reduce their readmission rates. 17 The program emphasized early postdischarge ambulatory care follow-up and patient education. Further, new programs are being initiated to address the burden of unplanned readmissions. The Patient Navigator Program of the American College of Cardiology aims to reduce avoidable hospital readmissions for patients discharged with acute myocardial infarction by supporting a culture of patient-centered care during the hospital stay and in the weeks following discharge. 18 Adoption of these programs may have led to much wider improvements in readmission rates through improved healthcare delivery, patient education, and improved follow-up, which were not limited to the patients covered under the HRRP directly. This information also represents critical feedback to health policy makers, since health policy interventions may have wider implications for patient health and wellness.",

However, this exclusion was consistent across study years and has been recommended by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. 19 Third, we are unable to specifically account for the competing risk of posthospitalization mortality. However, our analysis compares temporal trends in specific insurance groups, and therefore trends may be consistent across study years. Fourth, changing trends may be subject to directional changes in coding practices. However, it is unclear if such coding changes would disproportionately affect certain patient groups. Fifth, insurance categories defined in the study rely on those reported as the primary payer in the NRD. Moreover, individuals reported as covered under Medicare include both fee-for-service and managed care beneficiaries. Therefore, trends may vary if payers are defined differently.
