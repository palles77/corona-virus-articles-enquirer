The objective of the present study is to further investigate the wind induced inter-flat pollutant transmission and cross contamination routes in typical buildings in Shanghai. In this paper, a set of experiments was carried out in a boundary layer wind tunnel using a 1:30 reduced scale model that represented the typical configuration of rectangular multi-storey residential buildings. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) was employed as a tracer gas in the wind tunnel tests. Two natural ventilation modes, single-sided ventilation and cross ventilation were considered. The conditions under prevailing wind direction with different source locations on the windward side were compared. The pressure coefficients on all of the building fa\u00e7ades and tracer gas concentration distributions were monitored and analysed. The experimental results elucidated that contaminant released from windward units could spread vertically and horizontally to other units on the source fa\u00e7ade and downstream units. The source location was a significant influence factor on the pollutant concentration in various units. In the single-sided ventilated building, the infected risks of leeward units were even higher than those in some windward units. In the cross ventilated building, the vertical transmission could be suppressed and the horizontal transmission was reinforced. The study is helpful for further understanding of the inter-flat airborne transmission within an isolated building.",

City dwellers spend more than 80% of their time indoors [2, 3] , notably over half of this time in their homes. All these lead to an increasing concern to ensure a better indoor environment quality related to thermal comfort, health and productivity issues [4, 5] . Natural ventilation is an effective and sustainable approach to induce the air exchange through openings of the room to improve the indoor environment and dilute the polluted indoor air by bringing fresh air from outside [6e8]. However, undesirable consequences caused by natural ventilation have been detected in recent years and aroused public concern because of the frequent occurrence of airborne epidemic diseases [9e12] . Natural ventilation is thus a seeming contradiction for the indoor pollutant control, which could dilute the indoor pollutant concentration on one hand, but on the other hand it may also introduce pollutants to uninfected flats. Airborne transmission is believed as one of the major modes that could cause the virus transmission and infection [13, 14] . A special airborne infection scenario called inter-flat cross contamination was identified as an important airborne route related to natural ventilation and started to be investigated after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [15, 16] .",

            "text": "Tracking the large-scale outbreak of SARS in the residential community, Li et al. [17] built up the airflow network considering the air leakage of different flat and the re-entrance space by a multi-zone model, thereby predicted the airflow path and infection pattern on different floors. Niu et al. then found the probability of the re-entry behavior of the air exhausted from a single-sided open window to an upper floor by both CFD simulation [18] and on-site experimental studies [19] . The on-site study revealed that re-entry ratio of the upward outflow driven by temperature difference from a lower flat to the adjacent upper one could get to 7% under gentle wind conditions. Gao et al. [20] and Liu et al. [21] further explained this cascade effect by simplified CFD simulations on two adjacent rooms combined with a tracer gas method, concluding that the infection risk of the immediate upper room is lower than the source room by only 1 order of magnitude, though the concentration is lower by 2 orders of magnitude. In addition, Liu et al. [21] also discussed the probability to reduce this vertical crosscontamination by modifying the window configurations and introduced individual mechanical exhaust. A recent research by Wu et al. [22] explored the ventilation strategy using mechanical exhaust to avoid the vertical cascade transmission. Besides, Liu et al. [23, 24] and Wang et al. [25] performed wind tunnel tests to investigate the wind effect on the pollutant dispersion around cross shape buildings. The results indicated that both vertical and horizontal transmission could process in the re-entry area. The dispersion characteristics can be affected by source location and wind directions. Moreover, Liu et al. [26] analysed the unsteady characteristics of gas dispersion under both open and closed window scenarios and concluded that fluctuating concentrations should be paid attention to when evaluating potential risks. Based on these wind tunnel experimental data, further numerical studies were conducted to extend the research [27, 28] . Their studies mostly focused on a typical cross-shaped high-rise building with a reentrance space on each fa\u00e7ade. Extensive simulation works by Cheng et al. [29] discussed the airflow within the re-entry bay of different depth and width, considering a generic H shaped highrise building. The transmission mechanism of the gaseous pollutants inside a cross-like high-rise building driven by stack effect and a combination of stack and wind effect was well demonstrated in the twin work by Yang et al. [30] and Mao et al. [31] . Their work also revealed the complicated situation when considering the wind effect and different pollutant source locations. In consideration of the building envelop, Ai et al.",

The results mainly focused on the infection probability of flats on the pollutant source fa\u00e7ade. However, the contaminant from the upstream flat of a building can spread to the downstream units with the airflow, namely disperse from one fa\u00e7ade to another [35e38]. Our previous paper [39] qualitatively and quantitatively investigated aforementioned phenomenon and compared the performances of singlesided and cross ventilation under different wind directions with the tracer gas released from a specific unit. The results showed that compared with single-sided ventilation, cross ventilation could weaken the vertical transmission for a specific windward or leeward source and reinforce the horizontal dispersion for a specific sideward source. The leeward units got high risks of infection in single-sided ventilation under normal and oblique wind directions. Nevertheless, the conditions under a certain source location can only reveal a part of pollutant dispersion characteristics in a multi-storey building. Hence, the purpose of this study is to further explore the wind-induced pollutant inter-flat transmission process within and around a rectangular multi-storey building with natural ventilation, taking into account the effect of source locations. We performed a range of experiments in an atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnel with a 1:30 scaled model. The pressure coefficient and pollutant concentration distributions along all the building fa\u00e7ades were measured and analysed. The results obtained from the present work were expected to be useful for more effective designs and measures in the control of infection.",

It is a low speed open circuit one. The dimension of test section in this wind tunnel is 1.8 m high, 1.8 m wide and 12 m long. The atmospheric boundary layer flow was generated by specific spires, grills and roughness elements, as shown in Fig. 1 . The power law exponent of velocity profile was 0.22 [40] . The turbulence intensity of the approaching wind flow was in a range of 10%e20%. The dimensionless mean velocity profile U VD defined as U(h)/U ref was presented to meet the similarity criteria of approaching boundary conditions, and the characteristic velocity U ref was set as the velocity at building height. The normalized velocity profile and measured turbulence intensity were presented in Fig. 2 . The height was normalized by h/H b . For a scaled modelling of airflows and plume dispersion in the wind tunnel study, a series of similarity requirements between prototype and scaled model should be examined carefully as reported in literature [41] . Some of the similarity parameters can be neglected due to their poor relative importance when simulating pollutant transmission in and around buildings without thermal effect, while the Reynolds number must be paid attention to [42] . For the present tests, the mean flow velocity U ref measured at the building height, which was 0.59 m in the scaled model, had a value of 2.89 m/s. Hence, the building Reynolds number, Re \u00bc U ref H b /n, could be over 15,000 [43] and up to 1.15 \u00c2 10 5 , assuring that the test results were independent of the Reynolds number.",

The building contains six floors and each floor contains a corridor with three units at each side. Each unit has a window on the exterior wall and a door on the inner wall. All the units have the same dimensions, as shown in Fig. 3 . Geometric similarity is satisfied and the blockage ratio is 5.46%. The cross-contamination could happen caused by the single-sided ventilation in Model A with all windows open and doors closed and by cross ventilation in Model B with all windows and doors open. The tracer gas sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) was employed to simulate the pollutant. SF 6 was released at a constant flow rate of 15 ml/s during a series of concentration tests. The dosing outlet was enlarged so that the releasing velocity was low to 0.53 m/s. On account that the source location has influence on the wind induced pollutant inter-flat dispersion phenomena, according to the shape of the building model, there are 12 unique units on the windward fa\u00e7ade under prevailing wind condition, thus 12 testing cases for single-sided ventilation mode were designed. In view of the through-building airflow characteristics of cross ventilation, 4 cases for such mode were tested, as listed in Table 1 . The concentration measurement points were located at the middle of all windows' lower frame flush with the building fa\u00e7ade. The sampling time interval was 180s for each measuring point. The experiments were repeated three times to obtain the mean concentration value for each case. The mean pressure coefficient distributions on the building fa\u00e7ade were beneficial to analyse the surface flow directions, and then track the tracer gas transmission routes, which are strongly related to the airflow patterns. Totally, 168 pressure taps with the diameter of 0.5 mm were used to measure the building surface pressure, which means each floor has 28 test positions and the sequence numbers are shown in Fig. 3(c) . The pressure taps were connected to three 64-channel electronic pressure scanners, which were positioned under the wind tunnel floor.",

(1), the pressure coefficient is a relative quantity. The positive and negative values have a relation with the original measured value and the reference static pressure. It is observed that the differences of value among points at a certain floor could be distinguished, while the differences among floors were small, especially on the leeward and sideward fa\u00e7ades. To have a better understanding of these data, a contour map was generated for qualitatively visualized wind pressure coefficient distribution on each wall surface. As shown in Fig. 4(b) and (d), the pressure coefficient distribution reflected a good symmetric tendency on the windward and leeward fa\u00e7ades because of the symmetric geometry feature of the building. The highest P c value was up to 0.8 around the window area of UM5th unit, forming the stagnation zone. The outflowing air from the stagnation area could spread to all around. Most P c values were positive on the windward wall surface, while several negative ones showed at the lower floors near the edge. The P c values on the leeward side varied in a small range. Fig. 4 (d) implied a slight flow tendency from the lower two-third part to upper in the vertical direction and a main tendency from middle units to lateral ones in the horizontal direction. As shown in Fig. 4(c) and (e), the pressure coefficient distributions had a slice of difference on two corridor fa\u00e7ades, but the range and variation trend of pressure coefficient along the fa\u00e7ade were the same. According to ASHRAE [44] , there is a fluctuating reattachment flow on the sideward for a solid rectangular bluff body under normal wind direction. Since during the test process the sideward windows were open, the unsteadiness of the airflow around the openings on the sideward of Model A could be more complicated. Overall, the negative P c values on the leeward fa\u00e7ade were higher than that on the corridor fa\u00e7ades, indicating a possible surface backflow direction from leeward fa\u00e7ade to corridor fa\u00e7ades.",

It is similar with Model A that the P c values of different floors on the sideward and leeward sides were very close. But the contour map for each side differs from that in Model A. On the windward side, a stagnation zone also showed around the window of UM5th unit. The P c values at upper floors were higher than those at lower floors. This situation appears on the leeward side as well, resulting from the cross-building airflow. It is obvious that the values shown in the contour maps for sideward and leeward sides in Fig. 5 were higher than that in Fig. 4 . In other words, compared with Model A, the pressure coefficient value difference at each floor between windward fa\u00e7ade and leeward fa\u00e7ade in Model B was smaller, as well as the difference between windward fa\u00e7ade and sideward fa\u00e7ade. Fig. 6 gives the tracer gas normalized concentration of Model A when the source located at the units of UM column. The framework in the graph for each case could be considered as the stretch-out view of the building fa\u00e7ades. The number in each grid box is the average normalized concentration value in the corresponding sample location of each room. Both the signal intensity and color grey scale were used to represent the concentration level. The signal was divided into five grades, as shown in the legend. On the whole, wherever the tracer gas was released, the concentrations varied with the locations of measuring points under prevailing wind direction. The source unit got the highest concentration value and a unique full signal. The concentrations at other flats universally decreased with the distance from the releasing flat along the vertical direction. In addition, the concentration distributions along the corresponding \"R\" and \"L\" columns in each case also had good symmetric features. Tracer gas generated quite high concentrations at the units horizontally closest to the source unit.",

            "text": "Generally speaking, when the source floor was below the stagnation zone, the tracer gas was more likely to move downward on the windward fa\u00e7ade. The tracer gas released at the stagnation zone unit tended to develop an entire high concentration on all fa\u00e7ades. For all cases, majority of the concentration in the leeward side were between 1 and 10 when the source was 100. Besides, the concentration variation in pace with column on the leeward side could be ignored. The values show an approximate linear change along with height in each case. As the source location going up, the concentration values on lower leeward units were firstly higher than upper ones and finally smaller than them. Fig. 7 shows the tracer gas dispersion characteristics when the source located at the units of UR column. Since UR column was one of the lateral columns on the windward side, the airflow normally moved from middle column to side column along horizontal direction, source released from UR column had a slight chance to spread to the other two columns on this fa\u00e7ade. Owing to the inherent unsteady characteristics of approaching wind and diffusion effect of contaminant, the tracer gas still could be measured at UM and UL column although the values were very low. Fig. 7(a) gives the concentration distributions when the source located at the first floor of UR column. On the windward side, the normalized concentration decayed rapidly from 100 to below 1 in the upward vertical direction of UR column. The profile of concentration at the leeward side were alike that in Fig. 6(a) . For sideward fa\u00e7ade, the concentrations had a downtrend as height increasing and the values on \"CL\" column were lower than those on \"CR\" column. Similar concentration distributions appeared in Fig. 7 (b) when the source position was at the second floor of UR column, except that a dispersion path from the second floor vertically downward to the first floor showed on the windward side. Fig. 7 (c) shows the tracer gas dispersion when the source location was on the third floor of UR column. On the windward fa\u00e7ade, the concentration values at other flats decreased with the distance from the releasing flat along the UR column. A sharp decrease of concentration was observed in the upward direction of UR column, while the concentration descended gradually by one order of magnitude for every lower vertical flat. On the leeward side, all of the concentrations were approximately one order of magnitude lower than the source floor, and their variation with floor and column was quite small. The signal intensity feature on the sideward fa\u00e7ade was similar to the former case. For condition of Case N10 shown in Fig. 7(d) , the tracer gas transmission route was analogical with Case N9.",

The results showed that the stagnation zone in this building approximately formed around the fifth floor of middle column on the windward side. The mean tracer gas concentration distributions at different points of each fa\u00e7ade were monitored to reveal the dispersion characteristics and compare the different performance among various cases with distinct source position. Generally, for cases with source positions at the windward middle column, the concentrations showed good symmetric features due to the geometric symmetry, the same tendency appeared as well for the pressure coefficient. In overall cases in single-sided ventilated building, the variation of concentration values on the leeward side with column was negligible, possibly due to the fluctuant wake flow of the building. The leeward units got high risks of infection because their concentrations approximate one order of magnitude lower than the source unit, and even higher than some windward units. Moreover, the concentration profile at the leeward side presented an approximate linear variation with the height in each single-sided case, and the concentration values in lower units were firstly higher than upper ones and then smaller than upper units as the source location changed from 1st floor to 6th floor. Besides, the concentrations on the sideward fa\u00e7ades were also remarkable in most cases. Due to the pass-through airflow patterns in the cross ventilated building, the vertical transmission was suppressed and the horizontal spread was enhanced by this ventilation mode.",
