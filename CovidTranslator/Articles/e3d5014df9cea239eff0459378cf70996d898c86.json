LUBY, MD ABSTRACT: Pneumonias in adults due to mycoplasma, chlamydiae, and viruses are a common clinical problem. These microorganisms contribute to the etiologies in 6-35% of all cases of pneumonia and are the sole pathogens in 1-17% of hospitalized cases. Important trends and developments in the field include (1) the emergence of a Chlamydia psittaci strain (TWAR) that is passaged from human to human, causes a mycoplasma-like illness, and that is relatively resistant to erythromycin, (2) the recognition of respiratory syncytial virus as a pathogen in nursing home outbreaks and in immunosuppressed adults, (3) the continuing high lethality of fully developed influenza pneumonia, (4) the efficacy of acyclovir and adenine arabinoside in limiting the complications of varicella-zoster virus infections, and (5) the increasing frequency of pneumonia caused by cytomegalovirus and the severity of this disorder in highly immunosuppressed patients. Developments in the rapid diagnosis and therapy of respiratory syncytial virus infections with an aerosolized antiviral drug in children may pave the way for comparable advances in difficult pneumonias in adult patients. KEY Population-based studies on the incidence ofpneumonia have been performed infrequently. In one study, during an 8-year interval from December 1, 1963 , through November 30, 1971 , Foy and her col- leagues determined the incidence of pneumonia in a prepaid medical health insurance plan comprising more than 100,000 members in Seattle, Washington. 1 They found that total pneumonia rates varied yearly and ranged between 7.2 and 16.8 cases/1,000 population/year. Only 15% of the cases seen by the physicians caring for this group were hospitalized; 85% of the total number of cases were managed as outpatients. In adults, 35% of all cases of pneumonia were associated with cultural and/or serologic evidence of mycoplasma and/or viral infection. Total rates for all cases of pneumonia increased during influenza A2 epidemic years. The highest rates were generally found in the winter quarter, followed by rates occurring during the spring quarter ( Figure 1 ).",

Most of the parainfluenza virus infections were caused by Types 2 and 3, but no attempt was made to ascertain the exact contribution of specific agents involved because of antigenic overlap in the complement fixation test. It was recognized that the majority of pneumonias associated with influenza A were related to bacterial suprainfection. Rates for all pneumonia were highest in young children, followed by a peak in pneumonia due to M. pneumoniae in the 30-40-year age group. Pneumonia due to influenza A virus increased in incidence above the age of 60 years. Of interest is their finding that sometimes pneumonia was associated with laboratory evidence of infection with more than one respiratory nonbacterial agent. The severity of disease did not appear different between patients with a single infection and those with multiple infections, as measured by duration of illness and hospitalization rates. In individual reports, however, it has been suggested that in certain individuals, multiple infections can sometimes lead to a more severe course than would have been predicted by infection with a single agent. 2 Overall rates for pneumonia as determined in this study were similar to those observed in the National Health Survey.",

The most frequent microorganisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus in{luenzae, Legionella pneumophila, and other gram-negative bacteria. The role of anaerobic bacteria in the etiology of pneumonia was not studied systematically in five of the series. A Nottingham, England, study accentuated the role of L. pneumophila in the etiology of pneumonia and showed the propensity of this microorganism to be associated with specific geographic sites. The major nonbacterial agents implicated in these studies included M. pneumoniae, influenza A and B viruses, adenoviruses, RSV, parainfluenza viruses, varicella, and C. psittaci. All of these latter agents could be seen as single pathogens but influenza A and B viruses, adenoviruses, RSV, parainfluenza viruses, and varicella virus also were associated with bacterial pneumonia. Nonbacterial agents contributed from 6 to 35% to the etiologies of all cases. An indication of the approximate incidence of nonbacterial pneumonia without bacterial suprainfection can be ascertained in five of the series and ranged from 1 to 17% of the cases.",

            "text": "The concept of primary atypical pneumonia was set forth in an article by Hobart A. Reimann in 1938. 12 The major bacteria-causing pneumonia were known at that time with the exception of L. pneumophila. The clinical entity of psittacosis had been elucidated. Influenza A virus had been grown in ferrets by Laidlaw, Andrews, and Smith. Reimann described eight cases of what he called atypical pneumonia, which he thought was due to a filterable virus. The description of cases allows a view of untreated primary atypical pneumonia. It now seems probable that M. pneumoniae was the etiologic agent in most of his cases. The illness often began in-THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL SCIENCES sidiously with fever, headache, and pharyngitis. With descent of the disease into the respiratory tract, the larynx became involved and hoarseness was present. Finally, laryngotracheobronchitis and pneumonia occurred. A troublesome cough developed in the patient that could not be alleviated and was only slightly productive. In some patients, a pulse-temperature dissociation occurred. During the course of the disease, which often lasted several weeks, patients became dyspneic and cyanotic. Two of the patients became delirious and had central nervous system dysfunction during the course of the infection. On physical examination, the patient was flushed and had evidence of pharyngitis. The physical examination of the chest usually revealed scattered rales without striking evidence of consolidation; in one patient a large pleural effusion was present. The white blood count was only modestly elevated. Chest radiographs revealed mottled or diffuse areas of infiltration. Attempts to isolate pathogenic bacteria and influenza A virus were unsuccessful in establishing an etiology for this syndrome. Reimann considered diagnoses such as typhoid, psittacosis, and epidemic influenza, but the history in none of these cases was consistent and influenza virus could not be recovered. To summarize Reimann's words, \"The infection occurred in adults and began as a mild infection of the respiratory tract; this was followed by severe diffuse atypical pneumonia and in two cases by the symptoms of encephalitis. Dyspnea, cyanosis, hoarseness, cough without sputum, drowsiness, and profuse sweating were the chief characteristics. The disease lasted several weeks.\" In 1943, Finland found elevated cold agglutinin titers in cases of atypical pneumonia. Eaton later isolated the agent in embryonated eggs, and Chanock and colleagues were able to grow it on defined media and demonstrate it to be a mycoplasma. The entity of primary atypical pneumonia became well known and later was defined as pneumonia that did not clear with penicillin or sulfonamides, or nonbacterial pneumonia, or pneumonia with no sputum or a mucoid sputum without a predominant organism on Gram's stain. We recognize today that the clinical entity of primary atypical pneumonia has multiple etiologies, particularly M. pneumoniae, but also C. psittaci, the TWAR strain ofC.psittaci, Chlamydia trachomatis, Q-fever, and viruses such as adenoviruses, RSV, influenza viruses, and para-48 influenza viruses. L. pneumophila infections often are considered in the differential diagnosis. ls Early bacterial pneumonia also should be considered when the patient is first seen. In retrospect, persons with this diagnosis are often excluded from series of cases to focus specifically on the nonbacterial nature of the problem. In pertinent geographic areas, acute histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis may present like primary atypical pneumonia. Major attempts to identify the etiologic agent on clinical grounds have been made, but the exact diagnosis usually depends on laboratory determination of the offending agent.",

Signs of an upper respiratory tract infection and the presence or absence of auscultatory abnormalities also aided significantly in the discrimination. Determinations favoring bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia included predisposing disease, a short duration of illness before hospitalization, alcoholism, the absence of signs of an upper respiratory tract infection, high C-reactive protein determinations and erythrocyte sedimentation rates, no prior antibiotic treatment, total leukocyte counts exceeding 15,000, relative lymphocyte counts less than 35%, relative band neutrophile counts greater than 20%, abnormal auscultatory findings, and the presence of lobar consolidation on chest radiograph. Differentiation between viral and mycoplasma pneumonia could not be made easily. However, symptoms of mycoplasma pneumonia before hospitalization lasted a longer time and these patients were more likely to have received antibiotic treatment in the interval before hospitalization. Patients with mycoplasma pneumonia were more likely to have lobar consolidation on chest radiograph than those with viral pneumonia, but in this study no distinction could be made between mycoplasma pneumonia and bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia on the basis of roentgenographic findings alone.",

Chlamydial species are more susceptible to tetracycline than erythromycin. Tetracycline is effective against rickettsiae but not for L. pneumophila infections. Up to 4% of pneumococcal isolates are resistant to tetracycline. A reasonable antibiotic choice is erythromycin at an equivalent dose of 30 mglkg of erythromycin base per day for 10-14 days. If Legionnaire's disease is diagnosed, a higher dose of erythromycin may be necessary. If a chlamydial or rickettsial etiology is recognized, tetracycline at a dose of 2 gmIday should be given. Occasionally patients with proven M. pneumoniae have been treated with erythromycin, failed to respond to therapy, but subsequently responded to a course of tetracycline therapy.ls Conversely, some patients with M. pneumoniae infections have responded to erythromycin after a suboptimal response to tetracycline therapy. Viruses may cause primary atypical pneumonia; however, antibiotic treatment in these instances is useless, does not prevent suprainfection, and may actually change the nature of the bacterial species suprainfecting the patient. Antibiotic therapy seems reasonable in this syndrome, however, because it is usually impossible to differentiate clinically between mycoplasma pneumonia and an entity such as adenovirus pneumonia in the adult. Advances in rapid laboratory diagnosis may be able in the future to influence treatment options but these techniques are still under development, are expensive, and are not widely available.",

M. pneumoniae attaches to the mucosal epithelium of the respiratory tract through a specific protein that enables the microorganism to adhere to neuraminic acid residues on respiratory epithelial cells. If mycoplasmas cannot attach, there is no damage to the host. Upon adherence, mycoplasmas are able to generate hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion, resulting in injury to epithelial cells. Because infection occurs commonly in children younger than 5 years of age, although disease is rare at this time of life, mycoplasmas may induce disease primarily by immunopathologic mechanisms. l7 . lB In experimental animals not primed by prior mycoplasma exposure, inflammatory changes occur only after a long interval. With reinfection, inflammatory changes occur more briskly.

Pharyngitis progresses into laryngitis followed by tracheobronchitis, and, finally, pneumonia. Hoarseness and dysphonia may be present. Middle ear involvement may occur with bullous myringitis, which usually heals without scarring. Occasionally, otitis may lead to tympanic membrane perforation. Sinus involvement is frequent but usually asymptomatic. The cough is often intractable and usually only slightly productive of a mucoid sputum that contains mainly polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no predominant bacterial microorganism on Gram's stain. When pneumonia develops, the patient has an elevated temperature and, occasionally, a 'temperature-pulse dissociation. Headache, irritation, a flushed facies, myalgias, and arthralgias are common. 2 3-26 On physical examination, the patient is febrile, appears flushed, and usually has physical evidence of pharyngitis. Hemorrhagic bullous myringitis may be present in up to 5% of cases. Physical findings on chest examination usually are limited to scattered rales, wheezes, and rhonchi and are often localized to the lung bases. Evidence of consolidation is not striking, although M. pneumoniae infections can cause lobar pneumonia. 26 The white count is usually elevated with a shift to the left, but rarely exceeds 15,000 white blood cells/mm 3 and the neutrophile band count is usually less than 10%.14 Chest radiograph reveals peribronchial infiltrates with accentuation of interstitial markings in adjacent lung segments, patchy alveolar infiltrates usually localized to the lower lobes, especially on the left, and occasionally hilar lymphadenopathy. 27 More than one lobe may be involved and a confluent lobar infiltrate may be present in some patients ( Figure 4 ). Less commonly, there is a diffuse interstitial infiltrate and rarely an x-ray picture indistinguishable from the adult respiratory distress syndrome. 28 . 29 Without therapy, the disease course usually lasts approximately 3 weeks, but may extend up to 7 weeks. 12 Extrapulmonic manifestations of mycoplasma infection often are a clue to the diagnosis and include bullous myringitis; neurologic disturbances suggesting encephalitis or aseptic meningitis and, rarely, transverse myelitis; arthritis; myopericarditis; hepatic dysfunction; splenomegaly; and skin eruptions.~u A Stevens-Johnson syndrome may occur. Japanese workers have described typical cases of pityriasis rosea that followed mycoplasma infection. 32 The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may be abnormal with an increased number of cells and an elevated protein concentration. Hemolytic anemia may be present resulting from antibody directed against the I antigen on the red-cell membrane. 31 Almost all patients recover completely after mycoplasma infection but cigarette smokers may have prolonged abnormalities in diffusion capacity.33 Individual case reports have described pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans, and bronchiectasis following M. pneumonia. 3~6 Glomerulonephritis with continuing renal dysfunction also has been reported. 37 \u2022 38 The diagnosis is established by culture of the microorganism or the demonstration of a fourfold rise in antibody by complement fixation or other serologic test. A single high complement fixation test antibody titer (~1: 128) may be used as presumptive evidence of infection. Cold agglutinin antibody titers at low level are norispecific but very high values (~1 : 128) also can be used to support the diagnosis.",

Later, in 1929-1930, a pandemic of psittacosis occurred involving psittacine birds exported from South America. The clinical manifestations were described fully and the epidemiology was established, leading to control measures that have kept psittacosis or the better, more inclusive term, ornithosis, at a low level of occurrence. Occasionally migrant birds can carry C. psittaci, and persons dealing with them may develop ornithosis. More importantly now, ornithosis is an occupational hazard to the farmer who manages poultry such as ducks and turkeys.17,lB,40,41 Clinically, patients with ornithosis have headache, fever, pulse-temperature dissociation, pneumonia, hepatic function abnormalities, and hepatosplenomegaly. Intra-alveolar inflammatory changes predominate in ornithosis with interstitial changes being secondary and less prominent. The chest radiograph reflects this and lobar consolidation may be seen. When lung involvement is minor, the disease can be diagnostically confusing, and present as a fever of undetermined origin. Granuloma formation can be found in both the liver and the bone marrow and may be a diagnostic clue. Ornithosis can be diagnosed by serologic tests with a chlamydial common group antigen by either complement fixation or the enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (EIA).

Infected students usually presented with a mild pneumonia that simulated mycoplasma infection and was often associated with pharyngitis and laryngitis. 46 In this study, the TWAR strain of C. psittaci caused 12% of the pneumonias in the student population. The TWAR strain of C. psittaci was isolated from the students, and serial sera showed conversion to the common chlamydial group antigen by complement fixation tests. Microimmunofluorescence tests revealed specific reactions to the TWAR strain of C. psittaci. The microorganisms isolated from the students formed typical inclusion bodies in tissue culture, were not stained by iodine, and were considered typical of C. psittaci. The clustering of cases had an epidemiology that suggested human-to-human transmission. Bird-to-human transmission could not be demonstrated in any of the cases.

Hospital personnel become colonized and may have no or mild respiratory tract symptoms. Transfer of virus can occur by patient to personnel to patient transmission or directly from the personnel themselves. Hands and fomites become contaminated by respiratory secretions and virus is spread to patients by direct contact with these sources. The pathology of pneumonia due to RSV is similar to that of other viral pneumonias; however, epithelial cells with intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies can be seen.

Influenza A viruses differ in the antigenic character of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. The H1N1 strain of influenza A circulated in the world from 1918-1919 through 1957, when Asian influenza strains (H2N2) became predominant. These strains circulated until 1968-1969, when Hong Kong influenza (H3N2) appeared; strains of this virus continue to be transmitted.

Influenza B strains have the same common complement fixation test antigen, and this differs from that of influenza A virus. The hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of influenza B virus are less prone to change; pandemic disease due to this virus does not occur and the interepidemic interval is longer than that of influenza A, namely, every 3-4 years. Serious morbidity due to influenza A virus occurs because of host factors such as age, underlying disease, and immunosuppression; because immunity wanes with time; and because influenza A viruses are constantly changing their antigenic character. In pandemic years, when both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase change concomitantly, THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL SCIENCES Luby there is a tendency for more serious disease to occur than if just one of the surface proteins changes.

The particle then undergoes a cytoplasmic and a nuclear stage of replication. Virion RNA is capped and polymethylated in the nucleus so that the RNA message now can be recognized by the cell and translated at the ribosome. 67 In the process of replication, the virus rapidly destroys respiratory tract epithelial structures in order to compromise natural defense mechanisms of the lung, such as mucous production and ciliary activity. In cases of severe pneumonia the epithelium of the trachea and bronchi are destroyed down to the basal layer and then metaplasia occurs, leaving the respiratory tract coated with a layer of squamous cells. There is involvement of bronchiolar structures and an intense peribronchiolar inflammatory process. In uncomplicated influenza, small airways are commonly affected, producing diffuse dysfunction in these structures, mild hypoxemia, and a compensated respiratory alkalosis. 68 . 69 In severe influenza pneumonia, there is alveolar cell destruction and disruption of the alveolar-capillary membrane resulting in hemorrhage into the alveoli along with edema, a mononuclear cell infiltrate, and the presence ofhyaline membranes. Thickening of the interstitium occurs with a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate. The process can be fulminant, occurring coincident with the onset of illness, or it can be more protracted, leading to the occurrence of progressive infiltrates over 5-7 days.

Initially, the pneumonic process appears as nodular infiltrates, 1-4 mm in diameter associated with an interstitial inflammatory infiltrate. a4 The lesions are more dense toward the hilum and are the counterpart in the lung of the pox occurring on the skin (Figure 7) . Peribronchial inflammatory infiltrates, hilar adenopathy, and pleural effusions may occur.",

The largest series of patients with herpes simplex virus pneumonia was reported from Seattle in bone-marrow transplant recipients 'and consisted of 20 patients with either a focal pneumonia (12 patients) or a diffuse interstitial pneumonia (eight patients). 89 The focal pneumonia was found associated with herpetic esophagitis and tracheitis and probably resulted from contiguous spread of herpes virus to the lung parenchyma. Diffuse interstitial pneumonia most probably resulted from hematogenous dissemination of virus to lung. Pathologically, the process can be one of a necrotizing bronchopneumonia or of a widening of the interstitial space in the lung associated with diffuse alveolar injury. In these highly immunosuppressed patients, both bacterial and fungal suprainfection occurred and it was difficult to sort out which process was responsible for what proportion of lung damage. Acyclovir has been shown to be an effective treatment of complicated herpes simplex virus infections in immunosuppressed patients. Its dose in the usual patient is 250 mg/M 2 every 8 hours for at least 7 days, but if the process has been ascertained to be a rapidly progressive herpetic pneumonia, the dose could be increased to 10 mglkg every 8 hours until a therapeutic response had been obtained. With the development of potent antiviral chemotherapy, there is a need to consider and diagnose herpetic pneumonia. Specific diagnosis can only be accomplished readily by lung biopsy. 60 Although involvement of the lung in infectious mononucleosis due to Epstein-Barr virus must be considered a rare occurrence, recent studies and case reports demonstrate that it probably can happen. 90 . 91 Careful attention should be given to possible coexisting mycoplasma and other viral infections, particularly since the former can be treated. Radiographic abnormalities may consist of hilar adenopathy, strand-like parenchymal infiltrates, diffuse bilateral pneumonia, and a picture consistent with primary atypical pneumonia.

Pneumococcal bacteremia, for example, occurring in the course of mycoplasma infections must be extremely uncommon. However, serologic evidence of infection with S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae has occurred concomitantly with antibody titer rises to M. pneumoniae. One case of staphylococcal pneumonia was associated in the Wisconsin series with M. pneumoniae seroconversion. Whether M. pneumoniae infection predisposes the host to bacterial suprainfection or whether the two events occurred together by chance remains to be determined. A relatively large number of pneumonias have an undetermined etiology and this varies between series of patients. In many instances, these pneumonias appear to respond to penicillin therapy, a phenomenon of interest in suggesting their possible etiologies.",
