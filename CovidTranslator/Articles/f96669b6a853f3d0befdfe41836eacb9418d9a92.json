It also spearheaded the development of sector responses in collaboration with other ministries. As the prevalence rates of the HIV/AIDS epidemic soared, there was international recognition of the multi-sectoral nature of the epidemic, which called for emergency international and national responses involving the mobilisation of sectors beyond health. In response to containing the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, National AIDS Commissions (NACs) were established in many countries with 60 countries having a NACs by 2005 [1] . A World Bank evaluation of the effectiveness of NACs concluded that the setup of the NACs was too quick, resulting in disengagement of the health sector because of conflicts arising out of the set priorities and the implementation of a multisectoral approach [1] .",

It also coordinates and promotes research, information and documentation on the HIV/AIDS epidemic monitoring and evaluation of all on-going activities [2] . GAC also provides financial support for HIV/AIDS intervention activities from the Ghana AIDS Response Fund established by the government of Ghana with assistance from the World Bank. The work of the GAC targets strategies aimed at the reduction of the number of new cases of HIV infection in the country. The National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) on the other hand is the body which provides analysis of HIV/AIDS incidence in Ghana and spearheads the campaign to reduce the spread of the epidemic.

Secondary data from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2007 were obtained from the Ghana National AIDS Control Programme and Biostatistics Department of the Health Ministry. Intervention time series analysis was applied separately to the data from the northern and southern sectors due to data collection mechanism and location of two tertiary teaching hospitals. The impact of GAC activities is measured by the statistical significance of the coefficients of the intervention variable. The intervention variable is coded as zero (0) for the period before and one (1), the period after the GAC activities commenced. It was shown that the HIV incidence in the northern follows an integrated moving average model, whilst in the southern sectors an autoregressive integrated moving average model was the appropriate model. No significant impact of GAC activities was observed in the northern sector. In contrast the GAC activities in the southern sector were associated with a reduction in new HIV infections (male = \u00c00.20 AE 0.13, p < 0.05; female = 0.14 AE 0.10, p < 0.05), corresponding to a 15% and 18% reduction in male and female new HIV infections respectively in the sector. It can therefore be concluded that the GAC activities were a success. However, greater focus of GAC efforts in the northern sector is required to ensure that its activities have an impact on the incidence there. international management of the epidemic in Ghana. They have also established a multisector and multidisciplinary institutional framework to coordinate and monitor programme implementation. They work in collaboration with GAC to minimise the spread of the epidemic. However, there appears to be conflict between policy direction and activities [2] . Fobil and Soyiri in 2006 assessed the GAC activities by reviewing the policy documents, technical reports and programme documents of the commission. Their review revealed that the activities of GAC have been a success. However, there were no quantitative empirical data or any quantitative analysis to support the findings. This lack of quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of GAC activates is what this study seeks to provide. The government of Ghana, legislators and other stakeholders will have an interest in evaluating the impact of the GAC activities on HIV/ AIDS epidemic in the country. Stakeholders have, over the years relied on new recorded HIV/AIDS cases to evaluate the impact of interventions without recourse to serious mathematical or statistical modelling. They have mostly depended on descriptive statistical techniques such as graphical and/or data presentation through tables to assess the impact of various intervention policies.",

The national HIV/AIDS estimates provided by the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) projected that about 264,567 persons were living with the disease in 2007 in Ghana [7, 8] . In this paper, we analysed de-identified monthly reported cases of HIV data from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2007. The data were divided into two parts; preintervention and post-intervention. The pre-intervention consists of the data before the establishment of GAC by law (from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2001). The post-intervention data covered the period of the operation of GAC by law (from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2007). Since the pre-intervention period is only 6 years it will not be appropriate to use more than 6 years postintervention period data to examine the impact of the activities of GAC. To get a fair reliable and accurate analysis the data was limited to the period between 1996 and 2007. This is to enable us to have the equal number of years for both pre-and postintervention periods.",

In addition the information on them was incomplete; in particular some of them have information on their gender missing. Ghanaian HIV data were treated as time series, observed in monthly time intervals. In all, there were 144 consecutive monthly observations of reported cases of HIV infection obtained from the NACP and Biostatistics Department of the Ministry of Health of each of the 10 administrative regions of Ghana. The initial data collected from different sources (i.e. regions) were linked using date of birth, place of birth, first names and surnames to eliminate duplication and de-identified by staff of the NACP to preserve patient confidentiality before releasing it to us for analysis.",

In addition, the geographical locations of the two tertiary teaching hospitals; Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in the southern sector and Komfo-Anokye Teaching Hospital in the southern sector were also taken into account. Most of the HIV cases in the regions forming each sector were referred to or diagnosed in either of these two teaching hospitals. There were overlapping of HIV cases across the regions as a result of these tertiary teaching hospitals receiving critical and emergency referral cases from all the primary and secondary hospitals such us district, regional and private hospitals as well as polyclinics in the regions within each sector.

The activities of GAC could not improve significantly the reduction of HIV infections in the sector. The decrease in the growth rate of female cases and the corresponding increase in growth rate of the male cases might be the reason for the insignificant effect of GAC activities on HIV infections in the northern sector as a whole. Although, there was an observable increase in new HIV infections in the northern section as shown by the graphical presentation in Fig. 1 , the decline in growth rate of the number of new female HIV infections associated with the activities of GAC is a remarkable improvement but cannot be solely attributed to the activities of GAC since their contribution was found to be insignificant. Inadequate funds and staffing in the northern sector as well as delay in disbursing of limited funds available due to delay in providing financial report on time may contribute partly to the insignificant effect of GAC activities in the northern sector [14] .

Our results partly support the study by Asante and Fenny [14] findings that the activities of GAC have been improved significantly but contrary to their assertion that it has been improved in all the regions. Our findings indicate the effect is on the southern sector of Ghana where the epidemic is higher. This could be that more of the activities of GAC are concentrated in the southern sector due to the high prevalence and proximity. The differences in the effect of GAC activities in the two sectors may partly due to the social economic factors and religious differences. While the northern sector is predominantly Muslims who encourage polygamous relationship, the southern sector is largely Christianity and polygamy is discouraged. In addition, the illiteracy rate in the northern sector is higher in Ghana compared to the southern sector [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] contributing partly to the differences in the evidence in regard to the impact of GAC activities. The poverty levels in the northern sector are higher than the southern sector, especially people from the northern, upper east and upper west regions [22, 23] and may partly hinder or mitigate against the effectiveness of the GAC activities.",
