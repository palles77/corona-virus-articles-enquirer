This study introduces a novel antibody immunoassay testing platform incorporating microfiber-based arrays of antigens to capture specific antibodies. The fabrication and setup of the device revolved around electrospun polystyrene (ESPS) microfibers that act as three-dimensional membrane filters, capable of rapid and multifold analyte capture. In particular, the ESPS microfibers were patterned through localized oxygen plasma to create hydrophilic zones that facilitate fluid flows and immobilizations of antigens. The bulk of this robust antibody immunoassay platform could be installed into a compact syringedriven cassette device, which could perform multiplex antibody immunoassay for antibodies specifically against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with rapid preparation amounting to a total of 5 min, as well as high sensitivity and specificity for the MERS-CoV down to 200 \u03bcg/mL.",

Furthermore, many types of multiplex immunoassay platforms have been reported, including microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) [9, 10] , paper-based [11] [12] [13] [14] , bead-based [15] [16] [17] and array-based platforms [18] [19] [20] [21] .

It can be seen that the most amount of BSA was adsorbed to the 3-mintreated samples. The lack of sufficient O 2 plasma time at 1 min likely did not allow the oxygen to fully penetrate the fiber thus not yielding adequately-hydrophilic fiber surfaces for the BSA solution to penetrate the fiber and come in contact with the fiber surfaces. On the other hand, the excessive 5-min-treated samples over treated the samples to become super hydrophilic, preventing any hydrophobic bonding between the surface and protein samples.

            "text": "This multiplex microfiber-based immunoassay platform hinges on several key factors including the patterned O 2 plasma treatment and efficient blocking that warrant some discussions. First, the rationale behind how proteins such as the immobilized antibodies/antigens preferentially adsorb to just the hydrophilic spots is of great importance. Generally, the protein adsorption on flat surface is affected by the hydrophobicity and surface potential [40] . In the case of EPSP fiber mats, the nature of hydrophobicity arises from Cassie-Baxter regime consisting of two kinds of hydrophobic materials, which are the untreated PS and air [41] . The O 2 plasma treatment modifies the surface properties of PS rendering it hydrophilic. For flat PS plates, the surface wettability of water changed from 77.7\u00b0\u00b1 3.0\u00b0-25.2\u00b0\u00b1 3.9\u00b0after treatment with O 2 plasma for 5 min. Interestingly, in stark contrast to the flat plates, the O 2 -plasma-treated PS microfibers resulted in greater levels of hydrophilicity (4.5\u00b0\u00b1 4.1\u00b0) after the same plasma treatment, as illustrated in Fig. 2 . This hydrophilic nature of the ESPS microfiber mat after O 2 plasma treatment can be explained by the Wenzel regime, describing the reduced apparent water contact angles for rough surfaces [41] . Indeed, the patterned O 2 plasma treatment on the ESPS microfiber mats resulted in separate regions with these two different regimes, where only the hydrophilic surfaces promoted solution flow through the plasma-treated spots. In other words, O 2 plasma treatment of PS was suitable for preventing air pockets within microfibers, and thus the protein solution could contact the fiber surface through wetting. On the contrary, the unexposed, hydrophobic surfaces of ESPS did not allow wetting, so the protein solution could not contact the fiber surfaces in these regions. Thus, although the total amount of protein adsorption is regulated by the true contact angle of materials, the apparent contact angle arising of the porous structure of ESPS microfiber is also a crucial parameter in dictating protein adsorption.",

            "text": "Next, a brief discussion of skim milk as the blocking agent is of importance. Often times, immunoassays are conducted with blocking agents commonly those of proteins which can adhere well to the surface without preventing any other adsorption of proteins to the surface. Among the common choices, skim milk, BSA or BSA-based products, such as BlockingONE exist. As noted in Fig. 5 , skim milk had the best results for blocking in the case of the O 2 -plasma-treated samples. The mix of variety of proteins that exist within skim milk could beneficially be penetrating the fiber and thus blocking the surface most effectively [42] [43] [44] . It has been found that casein, within milk, can be an effective blocking agent due to its small protein size. Together with other proteins within skim milk a closely packed surface of proteins can effectively prevent non-specific adsorption to the surface. In contrast, BSA has relatively large molecular weight components which can make random close packing of blocking to the surface difficult in comparison to that of skim milk. Another interesting point is that skim milk is considered amphipathic having both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts. As O 2 treatment is introduced to the surface, the hydrophilic nature may have allowed milk to be effectively bound to the surface.",

            "text": "Lastly, the comparison of the multiplex microfiber platform used in this study to other conventional assays and devices is important. A comparable work to this study was conducted by Sato et al. [45] , where a combinatorial assay was conducted utilizing a microfluidic chip together with integrated polystyrene beads to measure IgA antibody concentration. Similar to how microfibers were utilized in this study to increase the surface to volume ratios, microbeads were packed into a microfluidic device with a filling factor of 60% (bead diameter of 46 \u03bcm). Although they were able to achieve a high level of sensitivity below 10 \u03bcg/mL, their straightforward step-by-step immunoassay procedure of antigen immobilization and then capture of colloid gold labeled-IgA antibodies took roughly 1 h, compared to several minutes in this study. Thus, sensitivity and speed is often a fine balance for these immunoassays, and priorities should be chosen based on the applications of these assays. The multiplex microfiber platform in this study is intended for antibody detection for POC monitoring of antibody levels. It has recently been reported that the antibody titers of patients infected by MERS-CoV range from 1: 80 to 1: 800, depending on the time post infection, with the neutralizing antibody titer being more than 1: 800 [46] [47] [48] . Considering that ELISA is often used for determining antibody titers and its LOD is around 1 \u03bcg/mL [36] , it is suggested that the required antibody concentration for neutralizing MERS-CoV would be above 800 \u03bcg/mL. Thus, the LOD of 200 \u03bcg/mL for the anti-MERS-CoV antibody by the multiplex microfiber platform, although not yet as low as other established platforms, would be sufficient to detect the necessary antibody production in MERS-infected patients.",

The capability of a rapid FLISA was exhibited by utilizing 8-layered ESPS fiber mats treated with O 2 plasma. The patterned O 2 plasma treatment method with developed mask showed optimal protein adsorptive results at 3 min at 100W. This in turn created a hydrophilic surface capable of antibody immobilization and, further, rapid FLISA testing. In terms of the detection surface, effective detection could be achieved upon this platform within 1 min of operation time. Furthermore, the actual setup and preparation of the device could be completed in 5 min, which includes capture molecule immobilization, blocking and washing steps. The results demonstrated the capability of the device for multiplex analysis by detecting antibodies for both HSA and MERS-CoV concurrently. This microfiber-based multiplex immunoassay platform serves as a stepping stone for the next-generation POC device that would enable preventative diagnostics by accurately and rapidly determining the existence of adequate antibodies and aid general healthcare through appropriate vaccination schemes.
