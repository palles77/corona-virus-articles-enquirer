            "text": "In this journal, Freeman and colleagues described their evaluation of a national microbiological surveillance system for automated outbreak detection in England. 1 The Chinese government had also established a similar surveillance system after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003. That system is comprised of a web-based disease reporting system and the National Infectious Diseases Monitoring Information System Database. These resources have helped to strengthen the Chinese infectious disease prevention and control strategies. For example, the outbreaks of H1N1 influenza in 2013 and H7N9 influenza in 2009 were swiftly detected and effectively controlled. 2 Moreover, the outbreak of imported wild-type poliovirus in 2011 was quickly detected by this system, and the vulnerable population was vaccinated, which led to the successful termination of the outbreak within 1.5 months after laboratory confirmation of the index case. 3 In addition to China's population-based vaccination programs, the national microbiological surveillance system has substantially contributed to the control of infectious diseases in China during the last 11 years (Fig. 1) . 4 According to Chinese governmental reports, severe acute respiratory syndrome was eradicated in 2004, and during the last 3 years there have only been four cases of plague and no cases of diphtheria or filariasis. Since 2004, >50% decreases have been reported in the number of cases of anthrax, cholera, leptospirosis, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, neonatal tetanus, typhus fever, epidemic hemorrhagic fever, typhoid and paratyphoid fever, un-typed viral hepatitis, hepatitis A, gonorrhea, and bacterial and amebic dysentery. Furthermore, although the number of reported cases of kala-azar, rabies, epidemic encephalitis B, malaria, and rubella had The reported number of other infectious diseases has increased in 2014 in China, compared to that previously observed ( Fig. 1 ). 4 This is believed to be attributable to microbes being able to spread more easily now than before owing to a dirty environment, changed climate, and population migration. The national microbiological surveillance system has been able to effectively and promptly detect this change in status. Although China had effectively reduced the number of pertussis cases between 2004 and 2009, the number of cases was significantly higher in 2014. Although fewer measles cases were reported in 2014 (vs. 2004), the 2014 incidence was 8.5-fold higher than the incidence in 2012. The number of reported hepatitis E cases has also increased by >60% since 2004. Similarly, the numbers of reported acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis and influenza cases were 3.1-fold and 2.6-fold higher in 2014, respectively, compared to the numbers in 2004 (excluding the outbreaks in 2010 and 2009, respectively). Furthermore, the numbers of reported syphilis, brucellosis, scarlet fever, schistosomiasis, echinococcosis, and hepatitis C cases have exhibited fluctuating or sharply increasing trends from 2004 to 2014, with approximately 3e6-fold more cases reported in In conclusion, both China and England have effectively implemented national microbiological surveillance systems. Adoption of similar systems by other countries, especially Africa countries, may enable public health authorities to quickly collect information and make effective decisions to combat potential and ongoing outbreaks.

Although combination of mogamulizumab with vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisone, ranimustine, vindesine, etoposide, and carboplatin (VCAP-AMP-VECP) chemotherapy showed a better complete response rate, a phase II clinical trial of PJP has not been reported. 3 We aimed to highlight a prophylactic effect against PJP during mogamulizumab therapy and post-chemotherapy that is crucial for the success of VCAP-AMP-VECP chemotherapy and mogamulizumab as an upfront treatment regimen for ATLL.",

Although 1/5 patients with PJP at the diagnosis of ATLL died of respiratory failure, there were no cases of PJP after chemotherapy alone or when combined with mogamulizumab.
