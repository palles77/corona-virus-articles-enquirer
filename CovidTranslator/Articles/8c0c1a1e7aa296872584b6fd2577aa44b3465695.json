The piglets were the offspring from 12 sires and 31 dams. Data from an earlier experiment, including 96 piglets of seven sires and 24 dams, were added when estimating heritabilities for Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production. The highest heritability (h 2__ 0.87 + 0.41 ) was estimated for the total number of PMNL. Medium high heritabilities (h 2= 0.3-0.4) were estimated for the phagocytic capacity of PMNL, Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production and the total number of WBC, while the heritability estimates were lower (h 2 = 0.00-0.08 _+ 0.12 ) for the total number of lymphocytes, serum concentrations of Ig and IFN-a production. Pronounced differences between litters from various dams were found for total number of lymphocytes, IFN-a production, Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production. The Con A induced proliferation was positively correlated (r= 0.48, P< 0.001 ) with the IL-2 production and both these parameters were correlated (r=0.44 and 0.37, respectively, P<0.001 ) to the virus induced IFN-a production. Despite these positive correlations, no parental offspring group was uniformly superior across all traits measured. However, the heritabilities estimated for the immune parameters are sufficiently high to be used as genetic markers in selection for general immune competence of swine.",

            "text": "Genetic variation in immune responsiveness is documented in both laboratory and domestic animals. Resistance to infectious diseases might thus be improved by including immune responsiveness when selecting breeding animals. For that purpose relevant immune response traits have to be defined. So far, the most extensively studied immune response traits in pigs are those reflecting the antibody-and cell-mediated immunity such as antibody response to various antigens (Buschmann et al., 1974; Huang, 1977; Kr~iusslich et al., 1983; Rothschild et al., 1984a,b; Buschmann et al., 1985; Edfors-Lilja et al., 1985 ) and the proliferation of mononuclear cells induced by mitogens (Jensen and Christensen, 1980; Mallard et al., 1989a) , while less attention has been paid to the innate immunity. In mice, selection for high antibody responders to a multideterminant antigen resulted in high line mice which also had an increased production of antibodies to other antigens than that selected for. However, these 'high responder' mice had a decreased resistance to intracellular microorganisms as a result of a poor lysosomal activity of their macrophages (Biozzi et al., 1984 ) . To avoid such negative effects of selection for a single parameter, combined breeding values based on antibody response, mitogen or antigen induced lymphocyte blastogenesis, and monocyte uptake and killing of Salmonella typhimurium, have been used when selecting pigs for high and low immune responsiveness . In this selection experiment, the parental animals grouped as high responders also produced antibodies with higher avidity than those of the control and low groups (Appleyard et al., 1992) . These results indicate that selection for improved general immune competence of pigs might be possible.",

            "text": "Good markers for general immune competence might be found among essential parameters, such as the number of cells in the various leukocyte populations and/or the ability of the cells to produce cytokines. Genetic differences in total and differential number of circulating leukocytes (Mallard, personal communication, 1990; and in the ability ofmononuclear cells to produce interleukin-2 have earlier been indicated in swine. In the present study we have therefore expanded on previous work and examined the genetic variation in the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) and lymphocytes in porcine blood. Since the PMNL play a crucial role in the initial immune defence, especially against bacteria, we also measured their phagocytic capacity in vitro. Among the cytokines, we focused on the production of interferon-o~ (IFN-o~), an important innate defence mechanism against viral infections, and interleukin-2 (IL-2) which activates a variety of cells in the immune system. In addition, we studied the genetic variation in previously used markers of immune responsiveness, i.e. mitogen induced proliferation of mononuclear cells and serum levels of immunoglobulins. By using animals from a selection experiment with information from several generations and a statistical model including a relationship matrix, it was possible to include previously published data for some of the traits . Hence, it was possible to estimate heritabilities from the rather limited data set. By this measure, which is defined as the proportion of the total variation in a population that can be attributed to variation in genetic factors, it is possible to predict the usefulness of a certain trait as a genetic marker.",

The dam term contains the additive genetic contribution of the dam plus environmental and dominance genetic effects common to litter-mates. The analysis was carried out with the Statistical Analysis System program package (SAS Institute, 1985 ) using the GLM procedure. Quantitative genetic variation was analyzed using an individual animal model with a relationship matrix including sires, dams and grandparents. A common environmental effect, i.e. litter, was included as a third random effect. A REML (restricted maximum likelihood) program package using a derivate-free algorithm was used (Meyer, 1988) . This program gives estimates of heritabilities ( h z ) and the common litter effect (c z ), i.e. the proportion of the total variation attributed to additive genetic variation and litter variation, respectively. In addition, the influence of fixed effects is tested. As the model includes a relationship matrix, it was possible to link the data from an earlier generation on Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production , with the present data by adding an additional earlier generation to the relationship matrix. When data from several sets were analyzed simultaneously (total and differential WBC counts, Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 activity, pseudorabies virus induced IFN-a activity and serum levels of IFN-a and Ig), the model included set as a fixed effect. The effects of sex and selection line were tested, but not included in the model as they turned out to be non-significant for all the traits.",

Most striking was the high heritability (h2=0.87_+0.41) found for the number of PMNL, suggesting a single gene effect. The genetic influence on the number of PMNL could be exerted during the hematopoiesis, e.g. via production of granulocyte colony stimulating fac-tor(s). Alternatively, a large genetic variation in the response to external stimuli, such as infections or stress, could cause the high heritability estimate obtained for the number of PMNL. In the latter case, 'stress-hormones' such as glucocorticosteroids are known to rapidly influence the number of PMNL circulating in the blood (for review see Quinn, 1990 ) . IfPMNL are to be used as a marker, further studies are therefore needed to elucidate the regulatory mechanism(s) behind their maturation and distribution. Compared with PMNL, the differentiation and maturation of lymphoid subpopulations is influenced by a broader range of cytokines and thus regulated by a number of genes. This polygenic background could explain why such a low heritability (h 2= 0.00 ) was found when the total number of blood lymphocytes was analyzed. Consequently, the medium high heritability estimate for the number of WBC (h 2= 0.44 ___ 0.29) is most likely owing to the genetic variation in the number of PMNL.",

Hence, the high heritability estimates for number and function of PMNL, together with the important role of PMNL in the hosts early defence against bacterial infections, make these two parameters potential markers of disease resistance. This proposal may become even more relevant since recent results suggest that PMNL also release immunoregulatory cytokines (reviewed by Loyd and Oppenheim, 1992 ) that can influence the ensuing immune response.",

In pigs (Charley and Lavenant, 1990) , as in humans (R/ Snnblom et al., 1983; Sandberg et al., 1990 ) an efficient, but infrequent, natural interferon producing (NIP) cell has been described. Swine breed differences in the frequency of NIP cells and the IFN yield per cell, were recently suggested (Nowacki et al., 1992 ) . We found a low heritability (h 2 = 0.08 _ 0.12 ) for the pseudorabies virus induced IFN-c~ production. The difference in IFN-a production between litters (c2=0.39) as well as between individual animals was large (Table 1 ) . The latter finding is in accordance with observations in mice and humans, for which a 100-fold individual variation in virus induced IFN-a production has been described (reviewed by De Maeyer and De Maeyer-Guignard, 1988 ) . A number ofmurine non-structural genes e.g. the If-I locus, that influence the amount of IFN produced per cell have been identified. Ifa porcine If-1 locus exists, very large individual differences in level of IFN-c~ could be expected as a result of the segregation of the If-1 h allele. Interestingly, it has been suggested that the If-I locus not only affects the amount of IFN produced per cell, but also the early stages of a signal transduction pathway common to virus induction of IFN genes, as well as TNF-a and IL-6 genes (Ray et al., 1992) .",

The latter value indicates that maternal antibodies still were present at the time for blood sampling ( 8 weeks of age). In support of this, serum antibody titres to PPV, presumably of maternal origin, were present both immediately before weaning and 2 weeks later, but then at lower titres. It is not possible to decide whether a high Ig level in plasma of conventionally reared pigs reflects a good ability to mount protective antibody responses or/and a high incidence of infections. Therefore, the level of Ig, which earlier has been proposed as a potential marker of immune responsiveness (Almlid, 1981; Buschmann et al., 1985; Burton et al., 1989; Mallard et al., 1989b) , must be interpreted with caution.",

This is in accordance with findings in dairy cattle where no differences in a broad range of tests for nonspecific immunity were seen between lines selected for genetic differences in milk production (Kehrli et al., 1991 ) . Whether selection for improved meat production affects the immune competence will be examined using a reference pedigree for gene mapping consisting of crosses between Swedish Yorkshire and European wild pigs (Johansson et al., 1992) . In addition to this basic research, both heritabilities and genetic correlations need to be estimated for the actual breeding populations before immune response traits are to be included in breeding programmes.",
