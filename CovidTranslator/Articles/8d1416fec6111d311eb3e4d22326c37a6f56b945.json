Ad40 could enhance Ad5d1312 DNA synthesis in HRT 18 and HeLa cells, although its own DNA disappeared in the presence of this mutant in HRT 18 cells. In coinfection with dl 1520, Ad 40 DNA synthesis was inhibitied by d11520 in HRT 18 cells and d11520 DNA synthesis was inhibited by Ad40 in 293 cells.

Contrary to conventional human adenoviruses, the so-called fastidious adenoviruses could not be serially passaged in primary cells such as human embryonic kidney cells (HEK) or human diploid fibroblasts [1] . However, successful growth of Ad 41 in primary cells in defined conditions has been recently reported [24] . Ad 40 and Ad 41 can replicate with variable success in human cell lines such as HeLa, Hep-2, KB and A 534 cells [7, 23, 25, 37] Replication of fastidious adenoviruses in human cell lines is thought to be grown to some extent in the Ad 5-transformed human embryonic kidney cell line 293 [16, 28] , which contains and expresses the Ad 5 early region E 1 [12] . This has led to the hypothesis that these viruses were defective in early regions E 1 A and E 1 B or in one of them and could be complemented by early gene functions of Ad 5 integrated in the genome of these cells [28, 19] .",

[19] have detected by slot blot hybridization a complementation of Ad40 growth by Ad5d1312 and vice versa in HeLa cells. Due to relatively low yields of Ad40, these authors were not able to obtain visible restriction patterns of Hirt extracted DNA. We also used slot blot hybridization (results not shown) and found an amount of Ad 40 DNA lower in cells coinfected by Ad 5 d1312 and Ad 40 than in cells infected with Ad40 only. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the Ad40 reference stocks have not been obtained in the same cell line.",

            "text": "To know if Ad 40 could complement a nonfastidious adenovirus mutated in E 1 B transcription unit, coinfection of Ad 40 and d11520 was performed. Surprisingly, this coinfection led to an inhibition of DNA synthesis of both viruses. As a control, cells were coinfected with dl 1520 mutant and Ad 2 wild type. No inhibition of Ad 2 DNA synthesis was observed. Furthermore, dl 1520 was complemented by Ad 2 (Fig. 4, lane 2) . We do not presently know the reasons of the mutual inhibition between Ad 40 and dl 1520. Interactions between two adenoviruses lacking E 1 B products should not lead to an inhibition of the DNA synthesis of both viruses. Several findings have suggested that Ad40 E 1 B region is transcribed in an unusual manner [18, 26] although it is structurally similar to E 1 B region of nonfastidious adenoviruses [341. The presence of unusual E 1 B proteins of Ad 40 associated with viral or cellular factors might explain the inhibition of d11520 DNA synthesis in coinfection experiments. Our PCR results show that at least one mRNA is synthesized in a region corresponding to the 55 k messenger of nonfastidious adenoviruses. To know why dl 1520 DNA synthesis is inhibited by Ad 40, further experiments are necessary to detect and characterize the Ad 40 E 1 B mRNAs and proteins.",

Coinfection of deletion mutant dl 1520 and Ad 2 in HRT 18 cells analyzed by Hind III digestion of Hirt extracted DNAs. The m.o.i, of both viruses was 1 FFU/cell. The arrow indicates a specific d11520 restriction fragment in double infection.Amplification of cDNA from E1 B region of Ad40In order to determine of A d 40 E 1 B region could transcribe a m R N A coding for 55 k protein, c D N A P C R amplification was performed from R N A extractedfrom Ad 40 infected H R T 18 cells. Primers were chosen based on sequence data of van L o o n et al. [34] who have found an open reading frame for 55 k protein in nucleotide positions 1719 to 3147. Primers corresponding to C-terminal domain of this protein (nt 2485 to 2506 and nt 3018 to 3039) were used. Figure. 5 shows that a fragment of predicted size (522 bp) was present in Hirt extracted A d 40 D N A (lane 2). A fragment of identical size was observed from amplified c D N A from total R N A extracted from A d 4 0 H R T 18 infected cells (Fig. 5, PCR amplification of a fragment of Ad 40 E 1 B region. 1 Molecular weight standard, the sizes of fragments are indicated in bp on the left, 2 Hirt extracted Ad 40 DNA from HRT 18 cells, 3 cDNA amplification of Ad 40 infected HRT 18 cells, 4 PCR amplification from RNA of Ad 40 infected HRT t 8 cells (without previous cDNA synthesis), 5 cDNA amplification of mock-infected HRT 18 cells lane 3). Controls without prior c D N A synthesis (Fig. 5, lane 4) and w-ith mockinfected cells (Fig. 5, lane 5) were negative.",

            "text": "results previously reported showing a similar Ad40 growth inhibition at high m.o.i, in WK, A 549 and 293 cells[37].To test the hypothesis that E 1 A or E 1 B regions of Ad 40 were defective, complementation assays were made between Ad 40 and E 1 A deletion mutant Ad 5 d1312, and between Ad40 and E t B deletion mutant dl 1520. The DNAs of both coinfecting viruses were visualized after Hirt extraction and restriction enzyme digestion.InHRT 18 cells, Ad40 could not complement Ad 5 d1312 infected at low m.o.i. At high m.o.i, of Ad 5 dl 312, the amount of DNA of A d 5 dl 312 in double infection was enhanced but Ad 40 DNA synthesis was inhibited (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). This inhibition might be the result of a phenomenon of dominance of one serotype by another as studied by Delsert and D'Halluin [8]. However, results depending on m.o.i, values should be interpreted with caution. For example, 10,000 FFU/cell of Ad5d1312 titrated on 293, corresponds to 0.25 infectious units on HRT 18 cells and to 0.1 on HeLa cells(Table 1). HeLa cells infected singly with high m.o.i, of Ad5d1312 supported moderate DNA synthesis(Fig. 2 C, lane 1)and residual virus growth(Table 1). This is in agreement with previous results showing some leakage for this mutant[20-1.  In coinfection with Ad 40, the level of Ad 5 dl 312 DNA was augmented, although Ad 40 DNA was not detected(Fig. 2 C, lane 2). E 1 A functions of Ad 40 are therefore capable of complementing Ad 5 dl 312 in cells permissive (HRT 18) and non-permissive (HeLa) to Ad 40.",
