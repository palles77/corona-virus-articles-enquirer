This microchip design in connection with optics involved hinders the deployment of this technology for pointof-care applications. In this work, we demonstrate the implementation of sample preparation, DNA amplification, and electrochemical detection in a single silicon and glass-based microchamber and its application for the multiplexed detection of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis cells. The microdevice has a thin-film heater and temperature sensor patterned on the silicon substrate. An array of indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes was constructed within the microchamber as the transduction element. Oligonucleotide probes specific to the target amplicons are individually positioned at each ITO surface by electrochemical copolymerization of pyrrole and pyrrole\u00c0probe conjugate. These immobilized probes were stable to the thermal cycling process and were highly selective. The DNA-based identification of the two model pathogens involved a number of steps including a thermal lysis step, magnetic particle-based isolation of the target genomes, asymmetric PCR, and electrochemical sequence-specific detection using silver-enhanced gold nanoparticles. The microchamber platform described here offers a cost-effective and sampleto-answer technology for on-site monitoring of multiple pathogens.",

            "text": "Decentralized medical testing plays a vital role in today's health care system. The blood glucose meter, which was the first commercial handheld device for medical diagnostics and developed three decades ago, is by far one of the most successful examples in point-of-care testing (POCT). In the years to come, driven by the ever-growing threats from emerging infectious diseases (e.g. avian flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome), the development of small-size instruments for on-the-spot pathogen detection is expected to be an important segment of the POCT market. This trend has already commenced with a few companies having launched self-test products for hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus detection based on antibody-antigen interactions (e.g. OraSure Technologies and ACON Laboratories). These systems give a visual readout indicating the presence or absence of the target virus in $15 min. One of the main shortcomings of these immunological techniques is their limited sensitivity. To address this issue, there have been significant efforts to develop nucleic acid (NA)-based analyzers (1) (2) (3) . The miniaturization of NA analytical platforms has many advantages over the conventional bench-top counterparts. These include low sample/reagent consumption (volume of micro-down to picoliter) as well as short assay time (minutes rather than days). Most importantly, they permit the integration of a number of functions including sample preparation, target amplification, and product detection, thus enabling a fully automated operation that can be used by untrained individuals.",

Despite their wide use in clinical/central laboratories, their application for on-site pathogen monitoring on a routine basis is still limited due to the large footprint and high instrument cost (mainly the complex optics). A promising alternative would be the inherently simple and lost-cost electrochemical method. Over the past decade, despite a great deal of work having been carried out on electrochemical sequence-specific NA sensing (4) (5) (6) , little work has been undertaken on the integration of these with upstream functionalities. In 2004, Liu et al. (7) successfully demonstrated a fully integrated biochip for cell isolation and lysis, target amplification, as well as electrochemical amplicon detection. One relevant feature of their approach is the incorporation of on-chip mixers, valves, and pumps in a self-contained device. However, the design and fabrication of the chip involves many complicated steps, which limits its practical application.",

One simple way to achieve site-specific probe immobilization onto individual electrode surfaces can Figure 4 . A schematic representation of the assay protocol in the silicon\u00c0glass microchamber. The three main steps were (A) sample preparation: thermal cell lysis and magnetic particle-based isolation of specific genomic DNAs; (B) target DNA amplification: generation of single-stranded rich amplicons by asymmetric PCR; (C) product detection: gold nanoparticle labeling, electrocatalytic silver deposition, and electrochemical silver dissolution. be achieved by electrochemical copolymerization of pyrrole and pyrrole\u00c0oligonucleotide (11) . Figure 2 illustrates the strategy to immobilize different capture probes onto each individual electrode. A solution of pyrrole and oligonucleotide 1 bearing a pyrrole group is introduced into the microchamber. When a cyclic voltammetric scan is applied to electrode 1, with other electrodes disconnected or grounded, oligonucleotide 1 is selectively deposited on this particular electrode. Then, the microchamber is washed with water to ensure there is no pyrrole\u00c0oligonucleotide 1 monomer is left. This procedure is repeated for the other electrodes with different pyrrole\u00c0oligonucleotide polymerization solutions. In our model system with two target analytes and four working electrodes, the capture probes specific to E.coli and B.subtilis are immobilized in duplicate. Before proceeding to the complete analytical protocol, the ability of these immobilized capture probes to recognize their complementary targets should be tested. Figure 3 shows the fluorescence images of the four functionalized electrodes (A and D: B.subtilis probe; B and C: E.coli probe) exposed to a sample containing a fluorescently-labeled sequence complementary to the E.coli probe. It is clear that electrodes B and C exhibit much higher fluorescence intensity than electrodes A and D, indicating the highly specific probe immobilization as well as hybridization offered by the electrochemical pyrrole-based attachment chemistry. Another criterion for the selection of immobilization method is the compatibility with other processes, in particular the PCR. Due to the fact that the detection electrodes are within the reaction chamber, the linkage between the immobilized capture probe and electrode surface must be strong enough to survive through the thermal cycling process (especially the high denaturation temperature). Moreover, the detector surface should interact only with the specific amplicon but not with other components employed in the assay protocol.",

It involves three main steps: sample preparation, target DNA amplification, and product detection, all performed within the same microchamber. Intact cells are first broken down by applying a high temperature (90 C, controlled by the on-chip heater and temperature sensor) to free the genomic DNA. To remove all the interfering substances (e.g. cell debris and protein) that may affect the subsequent DNA amplification process, magnetic particles are used to isolate the specific genomes. Biotinylated genome capture probes for the two model species are mixed with the intact cells before injecting into the microchamber. When the temperature is lowered to 50 C after the thermal lysis step, these probes hybridize to their complementary target genomes. These probe\u00c0genome hybrids are then isolated by the addition of the avidin-coated magnetic particles, followed by thorough washing. It is worth noting that the magnetic particles are pretreated with a small amount of the genome capture probes to minimize nonspecific adsorption of the interfering substances and other genomic DNAs. Subsequently, with the genomes captured on the magnetic particles serving as the template, asymmetric PCR is conducted to generate single-stranded rich target amplicons.",

The portable electrochemical instrumentation as well as a simple microchip design is conducive to the realization of on-site pathogen detection. The selective immobilization of capture probes using the pyrrole-based electropolymerization process provides good thermal stability and PCR process compatibility, which are crucial for the multiplexed analysis.
