We used a branching process model to derive the final size distribution of minor outbreaks, assuming a reproduction number above unity, and applying the method to final size data for pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague is a rare disease with only one documented major epidemic in a spatially limited setting. Because the final size distribution of a minor outbreak needs to be normalized by the probability of extinction, we assume that the dispersion parameter (k) of the negative-binomial offspring distribution is known, and examine the sensitivity of the reproduction number to variation in dispersion. Assuming a geometric offspring distribution with k = 1, the reproduction number was estimated at 1.16 (95% confidence interval: 0.97-1.38). When less dispersed with k = 2, the maximum likelihood estimate of the reproduction number was 1.14. These estimates agreed with those published from transmission network analysis, indicating that the human-to-human transmission potential of the pneumonic plague is not very high. Given only minor outbreaks, transmission potential is not sufficiently assessed by directly counting the number of offspring. Since the absence of a major epidemic does not guarantee a subcritical process, the proposed method allows us to conservatively regard epidemic data from minor outbreaks as supercritical, and yield estimates of threshold values above unity.",

Because of the well-known threshold property (Anderson, 1991) , given R 0 <1 we observe only minor outbreaks in which the infectious agent goes extinct before affecting a substantial fraction of the population (Diekmann & Heesterbeek, 2000) . Given R 0 >1, an introduction of a single infected individual into a population could potentially lead to a major epidemic which does not naturally decline until the pool of susceptible individuals falls below a critical proportion, and in which substantial fraction of the population thus experiences infection (though, as we will discuss in the present study, it must be remembered that R 0 >1 can also result in minor outbreaks). Accordingly, R 0 has played a key role in identifying optimal strategies for infectious disease control (Keeling & Rohani, 2007) , including the determination of vaccination coverage required to eradicate an infectious disease (Anderson & May, 1991) .",

These include maximum likelihood method and the use of estimators obtained from biomathematical and theoretical studies (Dietz, 1993; Farrington et al., 2001; Li et al., 2011) . Recently, the estimation of R 0 has mainly focused on the analysis of early exponential (linear) growth rates (Chowell et al., 2007; Vynnycky et al., 2007) . This type of analysis requires the prior observation of an actual major epidemic. However, it is frequently the case for rare and exotic diseases that we rarely (or never) observe a major epidemic prior to an actual large-scale epidemic event (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from 2002-3).",

Branching process approximation is one stochastic modeling approach. The discrete-type branching process is referred to as Galton-Watson process (Harris, 1963) , and the process with infection-age structure is referred to as Crump-Mode-Jagers (CMJ) process (Jagers, 1975; Mode & Sleeman, 2000) . Other than the branching processes, a martingale model has been employed to estimate R 0 and its uncertainty based on a single sample of the final size of a major epidemic (i.e. based on a single observation of cumulative incidence) (Becker, 1989) . For theoretical purposes, not only the analysis of single samples of the final size, but also final size distributions of major epidemics have been well analyzed through the socalled Sellke-construction (Andersson & Britton, 2000; Ball & O'Neill, 1999; Ball & Clancy, 1993; Nishiura et al., 2011a) . While major epidemics have attracted modelers' interest, little attention has been paid to the final size distribution of minor outbreaks. Only a small number of studies have analyzed the final size distribution of minor outbreaks adopting the key assumption that a subcritical process (i.e. R 0 <1) resulted in the observation (Becker, 1974) . Classical mortal branching process models have been applied to surveillance data for diseases such as measles and avian influenza (Farrington et al., 2003; Ferguson et al., 2004) . However, the final size distribution of minor outbreak data given a supercritical process (i.e. R 0 >1) have not been explicitly examined to date.",

Presently, primary pneumonic plague is rarely observed; though the form of bubonic plague transmitted by flea bites (in humans and rodents) is sometimes reported (Pollitzer, 1954) . When infected fleas bite humans, transmission of the bubonic plague with fever and lymph node swelling is possible. If Y. pestis gets into the blood stream, septicemic plague occurs. Systemic circulation of Y. pestis can also progress to the \"secondary pneumonic plague\", a lung infection spreadable through respiratory droplet and from which an epidemic of primary pneumonic plague can occur. However, pneumonic plague is not transmitted by aerosols (i.e. not by droplet nuclei) but by droplet infection (Kool, 2005) . In the absence of early treatment, the case fatality ratio of pneumonic plague can reach 100% (Pollitzer, 1954) . Due to the high virulence of Y. pestis, industrialized countries across the world have identified its potential for use in biological warfare (Inglesby et al., 2000) . For these reasons, knowledge of the human-to-human transmission potential of pneumonic plague is a critical question among experts.",

            "text": "Several studies have analyzed historical outbreak data of primary pneumonic plague, estimating the reproduction number R h of human-to-human transmission (i.e. the average number of secondary human cases directly caused by a single human primary case of pneumonic plague). Gani and Leach (2004) fitted a geometric distribution directly to observed distributions of secondary cases produced by a single primary case based on eight minor outbreak data sets showing transmission networks (i.e. a network showing who acquired infection from whom based on contact tracing). They found a mean and variance of 1.3 and 3.1, respectively. However, minor outbreak data are limited to outbreaks that decline to extinction and include substantial numbers of primary cases that did not generate any secondary transmissions. To avoid potential underestimation of R h , Nishiura and Kakehashi (2005) focused on time-dependency in the transmissibility and Nishiura et al. (2006) estimated the initial value of the reproduction number (i.e. theoretical R h at time 0 of an epidemic) as ranging from 2.8 to 3.5. Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) took into account the effectiveness of public health interventions, fitting a branching process model with a negative binomially distributed offspring distribution to a transmission network, estimating R h as 1.32 (90% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.61) and dispersion parameter as k=1.37 (90% CI: 0.88-3.53). They identified that published outbreak data tended to start with a superspreading event (implying that an R h of 2.8-3.5 in Nishiura et al. (2006) may be overestimated), and that the offspring distribution of pneumonic plague is not overdispersed. Other published studies on this subject include an analysis of minor outbreak data by directly counting the number of offspring (Egan, 2010 ) and a reanalysis of major epidemic data from Manchuria, 1911 in which the absence of bubo among pneumonic plague cases was partly noted (Nishiura, 2006) . Overall, the mean number of human secondary cases per single human primary case (i.e. R h ) is likely to be greater than unity (because we observed an actual major epidemic in Manchuria) with a relatively small variance in the offspring distribution. Since historical data for pneumonic plague are scarce, the finding of R h being slightly greater than unity should be validated using several other methods.",

We include outbreaks known to be the pneumonic plague (through bacteriological confirmation) and involving two or more cases (i.e. outbreaks with at least one secondary transmission event). These limits are necessary as the frequency of bubonic plague is much higher than that of pneumonic plague in literature, and it was not considered feasible to collect reports with only one pneumonic plague case. Indeed, the reporting of no offspring is usually underestimated (Lloyd-Smith, 2007) . We also ignored transmission events from animals to humans (e.g. dog-to-human transmission). Since an explicit estimation of the effectiveness of interventions is too challenging from only small minor outbreak data, and because previous studies documented extinction events or a decline in the number of cases before implementing control measures (Egan, 2010; Nishiura et al., 2006) , we ignore the influence of public health interventions on the transmission dynamics. It should be noted that a few published studies explicitly took into account the timing and effectiveness of interventions (Gani & Leach, 2004; Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005; Egan, 2010) . As bacteriological confirmation was a prerequisite for inclusion, most of the outbreaks studied occurred in the 20th century. Included are 18 minor outbreaks and 1 major epidemic. Among the 18 minor outbreaks, there was mean of 14.7 cases (standard deviation: 13.3), and a median of 11 cases (quartiles: 3-21). All of these outbreaks started with only one index case.",

The occurrence of a major epidemic in Manchuria (Figure 1 ) possibly suggests that R h >1. Using the pneumonic plague as an example, we aim to demonstrate a method that uses minor outbreak data for an assessment of the reproduction number in a supercritical process. Where possible, reproduction numbers should be estimated using major epidemic data. However, bites from infected fleas also cause human plague. Therefore, major epidemic data that involved many cases without confirmation of the absence of bubo and are not independent of flea biting may not be appropriate for the estimation of R h , because the time evolution of cases may be influenced by other modes of transmission (e.g. those arising directly or indirectly from bubonic plague cases). Also, dead rodents were observed during the 1911 epidemic in Manchuria, indicating an involvement of bubonic plague (Temporary Quarantine Section, Kanto Totokufu, 1912). To limit our interest to human-to-human transmission, we do not use R 0 to refer to the transmission potential of pneumonic plague and hereafter consistently use R h .",

This has been used to estimate a subcritical threshold parameter based on a mortal branching process model (Becker, 1974; Farrington et al., 2003) . The model can also be regarded as an embedded age-dependent CMJ process (Jagers, 1975; Mode & Sleeman, 2000) . Let Y be the integervalued random variable representing the total size of an epidemic (including the index case), described by the embedded GW process with X n cases in generation n. We have (1) Let p y represent the probability that the total number of cases is y, i.e., Pr(Y=y). Also, let \u03c0 be the probability of extinction. Since R h is assumed as greater than 1, the final size Y is infinite with probability (1\u2212 \u03c0). In other words, we have (2) Let the probability mass function of the offspring distribution \u03be be f k . As a well-known property of the GW process (Harris, 1963) , the probability generating function (pgf) h(s) is written as (3) for s\u2208 [0, 1] . With an assumption R h >1, we assume that R h =h'(1)>1. If the offspring distribution follows a negative binomial distribution with dispersion parameter k, the probability of extinction is calculated by (4) With a gamma-distributed infectious period and constant infectiousness, k in equation (4) could be interpreted as being equivalent to an inverse of the coefficient of variation of the infectious period (Anderson & Watson, 1980; Britton & Lindenstrand, 2009 ). Poisson and geometric distributions are special cases of the negative binomial distribution with k \u2192 \u221e and k=1, respectively.

If the number of secondary cases per single primary case is geometrically distributed, we get (28) For other dispersion parameters of the negative-binomially distributed offspring distribution (k = 1/3, 1/2, 2 and 3), R h is calculated using a solution of (4) (e.g. see (21), (22) and (23)) and estimated as 1.12, 1.08, 1.04 and 1.04, respectively. As the offspring distribution becomes overdispersed, the estimate of R h increases due to the fixed nature of the data used. Table 2 shows the estimates of R h based on the final size of minor outbreaks. As mentioned above, we assumed k as a known quantity and considered possible integer values of k (or an inverse of integer values) in realistic ranges. When the offspring distribution is geometric, R h is 1.16 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.38). When overdispersed with k = 1/3 and 1/2, the maximum likelihood estimates of R h were 1.22 and 1.19, respectively. When less dispersed with k = 2 and 3, R h was estimated at 1.14 and 1.13, respectively. This qualitative pattern occurs because empirical data are fixed and only the dispersion parameter is varied. In terms of AIC, the geometric distribution appeared to yield the best fit, consistent with Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) . The estimate based on the sample probability of extinction was not significantly deviated from the above-mentioned crude estimate. Figure 3A shows the results from conditionally fitting exponential growth to the major epidemic data. Assuming that the mean generation time is 5.66 days, the reproduction number is estimated as 2.16 (95% CI: 2.06-2.28) which is significantly greater than the estimates of R h based on minor outbreak data. As the mean generation time varied from 3.66 to 7.66 days, the maximum likelihood estimate of R h also varied from 1.59 to 2.96 ( Figure  3B ). The lower 95% CI of R h with the shortest assumed mean generation time (3.66 days) was 1.54 and was significantly greater than estimates based on minor outbreak data, except for the unrealistically overdispersed offspring distribution (k \u2264 1/3).",

The method was applied to pneumonic plague, which rarely occurs and has limited availability of major epidemic data. To estimate R h using the proposed method, the likelihood function must be conditioned on minor outbreak and include the probability of extinction in the denominator. Therefore, the dispersion parameter was assumed as known to rewrite the probability of extinction as a function of R h (and eliminate the probability of extinction from the likelihood). For this reason, we examined the sensitivity of R h to various dispersion parameters k of the negative binomial distribution. As a result, the geometric offspring distribution yielded R h = 1.16 and a less dispersed offspring distribution with k = 2 suggested an R h of 1.14. These estimates are in concordance with those reported from an analysis of transmission networks (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005) and did not differ substantially from estimates calculated from directly counting the number of secondary cases per primary case from a transmission tree (Gani & Leach, 2004) . Overall, the human-to-human transmission potential of plague is not very high, and is close to a critical level, in good agreement with field observations (Begier et al., 2006; Kool, 2005) .",

The present study shows that this can happen even when the underlying process is supercritical (R 0 >1), but the probability of major epidemic is small. The pneumonic plague most likely illustrates this case. Even though most historical data arise from observed small outbreaks, what is more important in public health is the assessment of the transmission potential of a major epidemic, such as that occurring in Manchuria. However, large-scale outbreaks of plague cannot avoid contamination by the flea-rodent cycle, and thus, if our interest is limited to precise estimation of human-to-human transmission potential, large epidemics may not be useful. Clearly, pneumonic plague is a disease that required an estimation of the reproduction number using the proposed method. Our study indicates that, given only minor outbreaks, epidemiological assessment of the transmission potential is not sufficiently achieved by directly counting the number of offspring in the transmission tree (because the reproduction number to be estimated is likely to be below 1 given minor outbreaks, even in the case of supercritical process). As long as our objective is to assess the transmission potential, minor outbreak data need to be interpreted with caution adopting assumptions of both subcritical and supercritical processes.",

Second, given a plausible range of k, we can assess the sensitivity of the reproduction number to different k, and check the robustness of our findings. Third, if assuming k as a known quantity is regarded as implausible (or impractical), one should be able to employ a special case, i.e. geometric, to the offspring distribution and (perhaps) conservatively estimate the reproduction number.",

There are several explanations for this potential overestimation. First, although the majority of cases were believed as primary pneumonic plague in Manchuria (due to absence of bubo), Y. pestis was isolated from dead rodents at the time (Temporary Quarantine Section, Kanto Totokufu, 1912) . The outbreak undoubtedly involved bubonic plague and thus transmission routes other than human-tohuman transmission during the course of the epidemic. Consequently, the growth rate is greater than that based only on human-to-human transmission, illustrating the difficulty in estimating R h from major epidemic data. Second, validity of R h based on epidemic growth rates is vulnerable to various epidemiological characteristics including heterogeneity and mobility of host population (Mercer et al., 2011; Nishiura & Kamiya, 2011) . Indeed, as described by Nishiura (2006) , the data in Figure 2A was extracted from the Japanese area only, probably ignoring dynamics in surrounding geographical areas in Manchuria. It remains that the exponential growth rate is useful epidemiological information, offering important insights into estimating R h . However, we must be mindful of the relevant pitfalls in the interpretation of the growth rate, and perhaps validate the estimate using other methods, as outlined in the present study.",

In reality, contact heterogeneity depends on the contact network structure in a population (Trapman, 2007) , often elevating the probability of extinction as compared with models with approximate network structures. Moreover, we assumed that the index case was in the population from the beginning of its infectiousness, although the involvement of imported cases in secondary transmission tends to be delayed (Nishiura & Inaba, 2011; Nishiura & Roberts, 2010; Roberts & Nishiura, 2011) .

            "text": "Because of the need to interpret minor outbreak data carefully, we believe that the proposed method should always be chosen as one of estimation methods given minor outbreak data and would be very useful for estimating the transmission potential, especially for rare diseases. When we observe only minor outbreaks, it must be remembered that the absence of a major epidemic does not always guarantee that the pathogen's transmission potential is subcritical (Begier et al., 2006) , and in such an instance, assessment of the transmission potential cannot rely only on directly counting the number of offspring. Thus, the proposed method allows us to conservatively regard the epidemic process leading to minor outbreaks as supercritical and produce the supercritical threshold parameter estimate. As long as we are not sure if the reproduction number is below unity, the investigation of minor outbreak data should always be accompanied by the proposed analysis. We believe that our estimation method has high potential for application to other datasets and we plan to extend the method to the analysis of minor outbreak data in heterogeneously mixing populations. The final size distribution of a homogeneously mixing population usually exhibits a bimodal shape where the first peak represents minor outbreaks and the second peak corresponds to the mode of major epidemics.
