Epithelia exposed to 95% oxygen plus 1 ppm ozone were stratified and nonciliated or very sparsely ciliated. The predominant cell types in epithelia exposed to oxygen plus ozone were serous cells and metaplastic cells. and focal aggregates of adherent necrotic cells were present.

The effects on human neonatal tracheal epithelium of atmospheres containing 20 or 80% oxygen have been compared (Boat et al., 1973 : Boat, 1979 . Ozone-induced changes in the rate of glycoprotein secretion into the culture medium have been studied using in vivo exposures and subsequent culture of the preexposed tracheas (Last et al., 1977) . Similarly, in vivo exposures followed by culture of the preexposed tracheas have been used to examine the effects of ozone and sulfuric acid on ciliary beat frequency (Grose et al., 1980) . When evaluating organ culture exposure systems, it must be remembered that solution of oxidant gases in the overlying medium does not resemble exposure conditions in vivo and is not suitable for studying the effects of poorly soluble oxidant gases (Rasmussen, 1984) . The toxic species causing cell injury may be different depending on whether the reactive compounds diffuse through a thin layer or a relatively thick layer of medium before reaching the cells (Morgan and Wenzel, 1985) . We have characterized the effects of ozone exposure on tracheal epithelium in vivo (Wilson et al., 1984; Nikula ec al., 1988) . In the present study, we have exposed tracheal organ cultures from rats to 95% oxygen and 1 ppm ozone, alone and in combination, to determine (1) whether epithelial responses to ozone similar to those observed in vivo occur in airways separated from systemic physiologic, secretory, and inflammatory reactions; (2) whether concentrations of oxygen sufficient to potentially cause oxidant injury result in morphologic epithelial alterations similar to those that occur in ozone toxicity; and (3) if the combined oxidant insult of oxy-gen and ozone result in more severe damage to the tracheal epithelium than that which occurs with ozone in air.",

The intermediate cells in this study are similar to those observed previously in rat respiratory epithelium and appear to represent immature cells, mostly preciliated cells (Jeffrey and Reid, 1975; Breeze and Wheeldon, 1977) . The metaplastic cells were polyhedral, their longest axis was parallel to the basal lamina, and they were located in the middle stratum of stratified epithelia. The most prominent cytoplasmic feature of these cells was the presence of numerous cytoplasmic tonofilaments. Numerous desmosomes attached these cells to neighboring cells. These cells had few profiles of endoplasmic reticulum and lacked secretory granules. The cytoplasmic electron density was greater than that of typical serous or ciliated cells. Metaplastic cells were distinguished from serous cells by their lack of secretory granules, presence of numerous tonofilaments but few profiles of endoplasmic reticulum, stratification, and lack of a columnar shape with orientation perpendicular to the basal lamina.",

The presence of intermediate cells, many of which appeared to be preciliated cells, suggests that ciliated cell differentiation was occurring at this time point. The lack of evidence of ciliated cell damage further suggests that the ciliated cell population was not undergoing repair in response to injury, but instead that the presence of intermediate cells was a consequence of the hyperplastic response. Boat et al. (1973) observed foci of squamous metaplasia, degeneration, and only a few ciliated cells after exposing cultured tracheas from human neonates to 80% oxygen for 96 hr. We did not observe similar damage in the rat tracheas exposed to 95% oxygen. We did observe focal stratification of serous cells, but not metaplasia, in 95% oxygen-exposed epithelia. An earlier ultrastructural study of rat tracheal epithelium cultured in a 95% O2 atmosphere concluded that the ultrastructure of the epithelium was well preserved for periods up to 4 days (Pavelka, 1976) . In that study there was a slight reduction in ciliary density in some ciliated cells, while a normal distribution of cilia was found in others. The differences between Boat's observations and those of Pavelka and us may indicate that rat tracheal epithelium is less sensitive than human tracheal epithelium to oxygen-induced damage, or the disparity may be due to differences in culture technique.",

The cellular antioxidant systems may be the critical determinants of the degree of epithelial injury occurring upon exposure to these oxidants. Several biochemical studies of lung tissue from animals exposed to acute high levels of ozone or oxygen have shown oxidation of sullhydryl-containing compounds and inhibition of enzyme activities (Mustafa and Tierney, 1978; Frank, 1985) . Perhaps the cellular antioxidant mechanisms were adequate to protect the cells when each oxidant was administered independently, but combined exposure overwhelmed these mechanisms and exceeded the threshold for the injury to be recognized morphologically. Cross-tolerance experiments have illustrated the interactions between these oxidants and the antioxidant enzyme levels (Jackson and Frank. 1984) .",

The presence of rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus was considered by Sigler et al. to be evidence that the metaplastic cells were altered secretory cells. The possibility that these altered cells are derived from basal cells must also be considered. Previous organ explant culture studies have concluded that metaplastic foci arise from hyperplastic basal cells (Palekar et al.. 1968; Mossman and Craighead, 1975; Lane and Miller, 1976; Chopra 1982; Chopra and Cooney, 1985) . The basal cells in the O,/ Orexposed epithelia appeared hypertrophied, but the population density of cells identified as basal cells was decreased. There was a concomitant increase in the metaplastic cell population within these epithelia. At the same time, cells with features intermediate between the metaplastic cells and serous cells were observed. It has been noted (Chang et al., 1985) that secretory cells in mixed rat tracheal cell cultures lose their secretory granules and all ultrastructural features characteristic of secretory cells. As suggested by Inayama et al. (1988) , if a similar dedifferentiation can occur in vivo or in organ culture, then it will be difficult to accurately morpho-logically distinguish altered secretory cells and basal cells.",

After 3 days of 0.96 ppm ozone exposure in vivo, the tracheal epithelium is not hyperplastic, but does exhibit an increased density of damaged-cilia cells, intermediate cells, and unidentified necrotic cells (Nikula et al., 1988) . Likewise, in vitro exposure to air plus I ppm ozone did not result in hyperplasia in this study, but did lead to the same trends in cell density changes although these changes did not reach the statistical significance level. The differences between the degree of ozone-induced injury in vivo and in vitro appear to be more a consequence of the greater statistical variability in the in vitro results than due to dissimilarities in biological response. The lack of an inflammatory response in the culture system might account for the slight disparity in degree of injury between the in vivo and in vitro results. Differences in the thickness and antioxidant capabilities of the fluid layer (tracheal mucus versus culture medium) could also result in a difference in effective dose at the cell level.",

There is one ultrastructural study of the effects on the trachea of 12and 24-hr exposures of rats to 100% oxygen (Heino and Laitinen, 1982) . The main findings were that the epithelia and cilia of the oxygen-exposed rats remained intact, but that fibrogranular areas and basal bodies were found in the cytoplasm of numerous ciliated and preciliated cells. Similarly, we found an increased population of intermediate cells (mostly preciliated cells) in the 95% oxygenexposed epithelia. Another ultrastructural study of the effects of 100% oxygen exposure in vivo on the rat trachea (Philpott et al.. 1977) also noted that the cilia remain intact after 72 hr. However, these investigators noted blebs in ciliary membranes and swelling of nonciliated cells. These later findings would suggest more severe injury in vivo than in vitro.",
