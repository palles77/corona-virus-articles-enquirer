We prove that if an endemic equilibrium exists then it is globally asymptotically stable for any length of time delay by constructing a Lyapunov functional. This suggests that the endemic steady state for both regions is globally asymptotically stable regardless of the length of the travel time when the disease is transferred between two regions by human transport.",

[7] have proposed an epidemic model which models a phenomenon where individuals in a population suffer from diseases and possibly become infected during the movement between two regions. The model is given as a system of ordinary differential equations based on an SIS epidemic model. Takeuchi et al. [8] analyzed local and global stability of equilibria as well as uniform persistence of the system. They found that there is a possibility of endemic situation due to the transport-related infection. However, as pointed out by Liu et al. [9] the epidemic models proposed in [7, 10, 8] implicitly assumed that the transportation between two regions occurs instantaneously. This motivated Liu et al. [9] to rigorously describe the disease transmission dynamics during the transportation by introducing the time needed to complete the use of the transportation. They assumed that it takes \u03c4 units of time to complete one-way transport between two regions. They obtained the following delay differential equations:",

Stability analysis for epidemic models is helpful for obtaining insight into the disease transmission dynamics.

In this paper we prove that the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if R 0 > 1. Our proof is based on constructing a Lyapunov functional and using LaSalle's invariance principle. Our mathematical results suggest that, when the infectious disease is transferred between two regions by human transportation, the endemic steady state is globally asymptotically stable regardless of the length of the travel time if the basic reproduction number exceeds 1.",

This implies that the endemic equilibrium of (1.1) is also globally asymptotically stable if R 0 > 1. The mathematical result suggests that, when the disease is endemic, in a situation where two regions are connected to each other by transportation, the endemic steady state is globally asymptotically stable regardless of the length of the travel time. However, one can see that in (1.1) it is assumed that the two regions share an identical parameter set. It may be necessary to consider two different population sizes and different dispersal rates in order to discuss precisely the impact of the transport-related infection on the disease dynamics.
