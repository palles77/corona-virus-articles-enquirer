            "text": "The complete genomic DNA of a novel papillomavirus (PV) was isolated from a basosquamous carcinoma on the wing of an Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus). Initial short sequences of the E1 and L1 genes of this virus were retrieved by PCR with degenerate papillomavirus-specific primers, and the entire R. aegyptiacus papillomavirus type 1 (RaPV-1) DNA was then amplified by long template PCR, cloned and sequenced with a transposon insertion method. The RaPV-1 genome counts 7970 basepairs and contains the typical papillomavirus open reading frames (ORF) (E1, E2, E4, E6, E7, L1 and L2). Based on a concatenated alignment of the E1, E2, L1 and L2 open reading frames of RaPV-1 and 46 other human and animal papillomavirus type species, a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed. This phylogenetic analysis shows that RaPV-1 has a closeto-root position in the papillomavirus evolutionary tree. Since RaPV-1 is only distantly related to other papillomaviruses (with maximally 50% nucleotide sequence identity across the L1 open reading frame), it cannot be assigned to one of the existing papillomavirus genera and therefore represents the first member of a novel, as yet unnamed, close-to-root papillomavirus genus. This is the first time a papillomavirus has been isolated and characterized from a member of the Chiroptera order. #",

They can cause benign and malignant proliferations of the stratified squamous epithelium of the skin and of the mucosa in various higher vertebrate species. In general, papillomaviruses (PVs) are highly species-specific, and interspecies transmission is a very rare event that has only been observed between closely related species (Sundberg, 1987; Sundberg et al., 1997) . The vast majority of PV genotypes have been isolated from humans, the only intensively studied host, and a wide genetic diversity of different human papillomavirus (HPV) types is associated with a broad range of genotype-specific clinical conditions, ranging from genital and cutaneous warts to invasive cervical carcinoma and skin cancer (Van Ranst et al., 1992b; Syrj\u00e4nen and Syrj\u00e4nen, 2000) . The limited number of non-human PVs that has been characterized to date covers a broad range of host species, including mostly domestic and wild mammals and two bird species (Sundberg, 1987; Sundberg et al., 1997; Tachezy et al., 2002b) . Taken together with the numerous partial sequences of putative novel non-human PVs that have been reported (Chan et al., 1997; Antonsson and Hansson, 2002; Ogawa et al., 2004) this suggest that every vertebrate species could carry its own set of species-specific PVs.",

The isolation of PVs could therefore in the past only be accomplished when the virus was abundantly present. The recent methods for identification of novel PVs are mostly PCR-based, and use consensus or degenerate primers that are developed based on sequence information of previously characterized PV types. These primers are usually located in the L1 and/or E1 gene, which are the most conserved regions of the PV genome. This approach allows amplification and characterization of part of an unknown PV genome, even when this is only present in minute quantities. Given the circular structure of the PV genome, the complete genomic sequence can subsequently be amplified by inverse or overlapping long template PCR (Terai and Burk, 2002; Rector et al., 2005b) . We have used this strategy to characterize the complete genome of a novel closeto-root PV from the carcinomatous wing lesion of the Egyptian fruit bat: the R. aegyptiacus PV type 1 (RaPV-1), which is the first PV isolated from a member of the Chiroptera order.",

The biopsy material was finely minced with a scalpel, and total genomic DNA was isolated by using phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation as described previously (Rector et al., 2004b) . Polymerase chain reactions with degenerate PV-specific primers were performed on the isolated DNA, with the following degenerate primer pairs (with the expected length of the amplification product, based on the sequence of HPV-1a): AR-E1F2/AR-E1R3 (371 bp), AR-E1F2/ AR-E1R4 (552 bp) and AR-L1F8/AR-L1R9 (704 bp) (Rector et al., 2004a (Rector et al., , 2005b . PCR was carried out in a total volume of 50 ml, containing 200 mM of each dNTP, 0.75 mM of forward and reverse primer, 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer/Roche Molecular Systems, Belgium), and 2.5 mM MgCl 2 [pH 8.5], with 1 ml of the extracted DNA as template. PCR conditions comprised 10 min denaturation at 94 8C, 45 cycles of 1 min at 94 8C, 1 min at 50 8C and 1 min at 72 8C, followed by 5 min of final elongation at 72 8C. Amplicons suggestive of PV-specific amplification were generated with all these primer pairs. The PCR products were purified through 3% agarose gel electrophoresis and extraction of the PV-specific bands from the gel (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, QIAgen, Westburg, Leusden, The Netherlands), and sequenced with the same degenerate primers as used for PCR. Similarity searches, performed with the NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTN 2.2.10) server on the GenBank DNA database release 145.0 (Altschul et al., 1990) , showed that partial E1 and L1 sequences of a novel PV were amplified. Primers for (inverse) long template PCR were chosen in these partial E1 and L1 sequences in order to amplify the complete genome of the R. aegyptiacus RaPV-1 in three overlapping long PCR fragments: RaPV-long1 of approximately 3.5 kb, amplified with forward and reverse primers RaPV-longF1 and RaPV-longR1, fragment RaPV-long2 of approximately 5.5 kb, amplified with primers RaPV-longF2 and RaPV-longR2, and fragment RaPV-long3 of approximately 8 kb, amplified with primers RaPV-longF3 and RaPV-longR3 (primer sequences available from the corresponding author upon request) (Fig. 1 ). Long template PCR was performed with the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The PCR products were purified on a 0.8% agarose gel with crystal violet staining, and isolated from the gel by using SNAP purification columns (TOPO XL PCR Cloning kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). The fragments were ligated into a pCR-XL-TOPO vector, followed by transformation into One Shot TOP10 competent cells (TOPO XL PCR Cloning Kit). The bacteria were selectively grown on LB agar plates containing 50 mg/ml kanamycin, and one clone containing the 3.5 kb RaPV-long1 PCR fragment, one containing the 5.5 kb RaPV-long2 PCR fragment and one containing the 8 kb RaPV-long3 fragment were selected. The EZ::TN TM < TET-1 > Insertion Kit (Epicentre, Landgraaf, The Netherlands) was used to sequence the cloned RaPV-long3 PCR fragment. This kit uses the Tn5 transposase to randomly insert primer binding sites and a tetracycline resistance selection marker into target DNA in vitro. The reaction was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The transposon reaction product was used to transform One Shot MAX Efficiency DH5a-T1R competent cells (Invitrogen). Twenty-four colonies were selected and the provided primers were used to sequence the insertion clones bi-directionally from primer binding sites at the 5 0 -and 3 0 -ends of the inserted transposon. The remaining gaps in the sequences were determined by primer-walking on the PCR-clones of the RaPV-long1, -long2 and -long3 fragments. Sequencing was performed on an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA), chromatogram sequencing files were inspected with Chromas 2.2 (Technelysium, Helensvale, Australia), and contigs were prepared using SeqMan II (DNASTAR, Madison, USA). The complete nucleotide sequence of the R. aegyptiacus PV type 1 (RaPV-1) genome counts 7970 bp, and was deposited in GenBank under accession number DQ366842.",

This was done separately for the different ORFs, and the unambiguously alignable parts of the E1, E2, L2 and L1 ORFs were pasted together in one compiled alignment of a total of 2700 nucleotides (nt).

A characteristic feature of E6 is the presence of two conserved zinc binding domains (CXXCX 29 CXXC), separated by 36 amino acids, whereas the E7 contains one such domain. In the putative RaPV-1 E6, the two zinc binding domains are separated by 37 amino acids instead of 36, and the second domain is slightly modified (CXXCX 30 CXXC). An identical modified motif is present in the RaPV-1 E7 protein. A putative retinoblastoma tumor suppressor binding domain, in which an LXCXE motif is considered critical for pRB binding (Moran, 1993; Chan et al., 2001) , is present in the E7 protein sequence (DLHCDESLDQEAE). The E1 ORF codes for the largest RaPV-1 protein (665 amino acids), and contains the conserved ATP-binding site of the ATP-dependent helicase (consensus sequence GXXXXGK(T/S), GPPDTGKS in RaPV-1) (Titolo et al., 1999) in its carboxyterminal part. The PV E2 ORF codes for a DNA-binding protein that functions as a regulator of viral transcription and replication, and usually contains a leucine zipper domain, consisting of a periodic repetition of leucine residues at every seventh position over a distance covering eight helical turns (consensus sequence LX 6 LX 6 LX 6 L), which is involved in DNAbinding and dimerization. Although a canonical leucine zipper domain is not present in RaPV-1, we did locate a putative modified motif (IX 6 LX 6 LX 6 H) at the corresponding position in E2. The RaPV-1 E4 ORF is completely contained within the E2 gene, and as is the case in most other PVs it does not contain a start codon. E4 is usually expressed from two abundant mRNA species, an E1^E4 mRNA and an E1^E4-L1 mRNA. Although PV E4 proteins usually have a high proline content (15-20% on average), this is not the case for RaPV-1 (only 5% prolines). The late region of the genome contains the major (L1) and minor (L2) capsid protein genes, which both have a nuclear localization signal at their 3 0 -end.",

The percentages similarity, calculated by pairwise alignments of the corresponding ORFs and their proteins, are provided in Table 1 . Although the RaPV-1 ORFs were found to be homologous to the corresponding ORFs of other PVs, only low percentages of similarity were found, and these values were comparable for all investigated PVs. The highest similarity scores (46-50%) were noted for the L1 ORF, which is characteristically the most conserved region of the PV genome. According to the recent classification criteria, PV types belong to different PV genera when they share less then 60% nucleotide sequence identity across the entire L1 ORF (de Villiers et al., 2004) . Since the RaPV-1 L1 shares maximally 50% nucleotide identity with the L1 of other PVs, it cannot be placed in one of these existing genera.

Their evolution mainly occurs through slow accumulation of point mutations, and recombination between the genomes of different PV types has to date not been documented. The general consensus on PV evolution is that different ancient PV lineages have co-evolved and co-speciated with their vertebrate host species. This assumption is supported by the observation that PVs of closely related host species are generally closely related themselves and cluster together in the PV phylogenetic tree, with dating of PV divergence largely coinciding with the divergence of their host species (Van Ranst et al., 1992a; Tachezy et al., 2002b) . The fact that the genetic diversity of PVs in relation to their host species is complicated by a superimposed diversity within single host species (as is the case for human, artiodactyl and rodent PV types, which are divided over different PV genera) probably originates from the presence of different ancestral PV lineages within the ancestors of these species. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that the novel RaPV-1, isolated from a carcinomatous wing lesion of an Egyptian fruit bat, is only distantly related to other known PV sequences. This close-to-root position of RaPV-1 was to be expected from the coevolution viewpoint, since no PVs from species of the same order as the fruit bat (Chiroptera) have been characterized to date, and the divergence between the Chiroptera and the closest related mammalian orders within the Laurasiatheria (i.e. the Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Carnivora and Pholidota) is dated as far back as 83 million years ago (Mya) (Springer et al., 2003) . This is not much later than the time at which the placental mammals first started diverging (107 Mya), which accords with RaPV-1 branching off near the root of the evolutionary tree of PVs (which were all isolated from placental mammals except for the two bird PVs PePV and FcPV).",

            "text": "Given the species-specific nature of PVs, with interspecies transmission being very rare and only occurring between closely related species, it is unlikely that PVs were transmitted to fruit bats in recent history. Bats are probably latently infected with PV on their healthy skin, as is the case for many mammal species (Antonsson and Hansson, 2002; Van Doorslaer et al., 2006) . In humans, cutaneous HPVs are highly prevalent in the general population, where they usually are contained by the immune system and result in subclinical infections. These infections however tend to become clinically apparent upon genetic, acquired, or iatrogenic deficiencies in cell-mediated immunity, Table 1 Percentage nucleotide (amino acid) similarity of the different RaPV-1 ORFs with the ORFs of PsPV-1, EcPV-1, BPV-1, HPV-1a, HPV-5, HPV-16 and PePV and cutaneous HPVs have been linked to nonmelanoma skin cancer in these patients (Leigh et al., 1999) . Whether the occurrence of PV-associated carcinoma in the Egyptian fruit bat is also related to immunosuppression is not clear. Virological investigations with respect to chiropteran species have mostly focused on their role as natural reservoir hosts of many viruses, and their implication in the emergence of a number of disease pathogens in the human population, such as rabies virus, Nipah and Hendra viruses, Ebola and Marburg viruses, and very recently also the SARS-coronavirus (Dobson, 2005) . The RaPV-1 described in this paper was isolated from a basosquamous carcinoma on the wing of an Egyptian fruit bat. To our knowledge, this is the first chiropteran PV, and the first report of PVassociated carcinomatosis in bats. The close-to-root position of RaPV-1 in the PV evolutionary tree, as the sole member of a novel PV genus, indicates that the knowledge on PV genetic diversity is still very incomplete, with many of their host species being under-sampled or not sampled at all. Sampling and study of many more animal PVs is therefore a prerequisite to obtain a more detailed picture of PV phylogeny and evolution.",
