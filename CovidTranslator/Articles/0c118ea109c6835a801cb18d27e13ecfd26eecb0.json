            "text": "Human plasma consists of mainly large proteins, which vary in terms of both composition and concentration with the physiological state of the individual. Alterations in protein concentrations reflect the current state of the individual's health and thus may be utilized as valuable biomarkers for a specific biological process or disease. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) has proven to be a valuable method for the separation and comparison of complex protein mixtures, for example, from disease and healthy states, as this method provides information regarding the variation, relative quantities, and structures of the intact proteins. The procedures utilized for the preparation of samples for 2-DE are critical to the acquisition of high-quality results for the discovery of biomarkers. The objective of this study was to review the preparation methods of plasma for 2-DE, particularly those designed to improve the detection of proteins in low abundance in plasma on 2-DE. The use of anticoagulants and protease inhibitors during the collection of blood, the removal of abundant proteins using multicomponent immunodepletion system, and desalting procedure allow us to compile profiles of proteins occurring in low concentrations in the plasma and to improve the pattern generated during 2-DE.",

The analysis of large numbers of proteins via proteomic techniques has greatly accelerated our ability to identify new biomarkers for disease or toxicity processes, including cancer [17] , diabetes [18] , stroke [19] , kidney diseases [20] , and exposure to aromatic hydrocarbons [11] [12] [13] . However, it has been estimated that up to 10,000 proteins may be normally present in plasma, the concentrations of which would vary, from millimolar concentrations for albumin to femtomolar concentrations of low abundant components [1, 4] . The majority of potential disease biomarkers may be present at extremely low concentrations within the plasma, and thus might be obscured by the presence of more abundant proteins with similar characteristics [1, 4] .",

Blood samples can be collected within a blank tube without additives, or drawn in with a syringe via vacuum into a tube containing an anticoagulant, e.g., ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), heparin, or citrate; they may also be either stored at room temperature or refrigerated [42, 43] . The type of anticoagulant and its concentration, the plasma storage method (i.e., storage duration or temperature), treatment with a protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC), the timing of supernatant decanting after centrifuging the sample, the number of freeze-thaw cycles, etc., will all contribute to the quality of the blood sample and, thus, affect the proteome in the plasma. Plasma collected with PIC can withstand temporary storage at 4 \u2022 C, temporary storage at \u221220 \u2022 C, or at least a single freeze-thaw cycle [42] . It is also vitally important to acquire the supernatant quickly after centrifugation. In addition, preanalytical variables, including sample handling, can alter the low-molecular-weight proteome within the plasma [44] . It was also recommended that at least 30-60 min of clotting time prior to processing would minimize the differences inherent to the overriding effects of coagulation, on the basis of the use of activator tubes, which promote rapid clotting [44] . Marshall et al. have determined that phenylmethylsulfonyl fluid (PMSF) and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid can affect the stability of the serum samples, as shown by MALDI-MS [42] . In particular, evaluations of the differences in proteins between serum and plasma treated with different anticoagulants (EDTA, citrate, heparin) have been published by several researchers [41] [42] [43] 45 ].",

In serum, prothrombin is cleaved into thrombin, fibrinogen is removed to facilitate clot formation, and a limited series of other protein changes (including proteolytic cleavages) occur during the clotting process [4] . Although many of the proteins involved in the coagulation process, including prothrombin, will disappear during these procedures, many of the peptides that are absent in plasma but are detectable in the serum can be identified after coagulation [45] . In studies of the differences between human serum and plasma using an orthogonal 3D intact protein analysis system (IPAS), several proteins, including alpha, beta, and gamma fibrinogens, as well as vitronectin, have been shown to be attributable to coagulation-associated proteins [43] . In addition, proteins which were expected to be depleted during the coagulation process were generally much lower in the serum samples, as compared with the EDTA-plasma or citrate-plasma. Tammen et al. reported in their peptidomic analysis of human blood specimens that a variety of artificial peptides are derived from peptides released during coagulation processes or from other types of enzymatic activity (plasma kalikrein) [45] . Due to the high levels of artificial peptide signals, they concluded that the use of serum samples is not appropriate for peptidomic studies of mono/oligo biomarker discovery.",

A treated blood sample can then be centrifuged in order to remove the blood cells, thereby leaving the plasma for subsequent studies. Although plasma compositionally resembles serum, it is preferred over serum for proteome studies by many (although not all) laboratory investigations, as its constituents reflect patient pathological status more closely than do the serum constituents. In addition, some changes in the blood constituents can be avoided via the careful selection and control of the types and concentrations of the employed anticoagulants [41] . The most popular anticoagulants are EDTA, heparin, and sodium citrate. There have been several reports of changes in protein expression patterns occurring in conjunction with anticoagulant treatment [41, 44] . Citrate and EDTA inhibit coagulation and other enzymatic processes via the chelate-formation of iondependent enzymes, in contrast to heparin, which functions via the activation of antithrombin III. In general, the maintenance of hemostasis and the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis essentially requires a series of enzymatic reactions, which cause sequential activation and the inactivation of protease, and Antibody based Monoclonal antibody -High specificity -Fail to remove the related fragments of target proteins Polyclonal antibody IgG-based system -Depletion of multiple proteins in one step -Lack of reactivity across multiple mammalian species -High affinity and high specificity -High cost -Low sample capacity IgY-based system -Depletion of multiple proteins in one step -High cost -High affinity and high specificity -Low sample capacity -High reactivity across multiple mammalian species platelet activation causing clot formation. Accordingly, the concentrations of plasma proteins are dependent on platelet stability [44] . Platelets tend to be most stable in citrate anticoagulants. EDTA-treated blood is only slightly less stable. However, over longer time periods, marked changes become apparent as the elapsed time prior to centrifugation increases [45] .",

The most abundant plasma proteins constitute approximately 97% of the total plasma proteins [4] . The core plasma protein, albumin, comprises approximately 50% of plasma protein content, and is present at high concentrations (on the order of 30-50 g/L). The other principal plasma proteins (present on the order of g/L) are immunoglobulins (Igs), including both heavy and light chain-fibrinogen, transferrin, haptoglobin, and lipoproteins. These proteins would constitute principal candidates for removal prior to the performance of a proteomic analysis of low-abundant proteins. A considerable number of attempts have been made to remove albumin and other abundant proteins from the plasma.",

This non-specific binding probably includes both proteins that bind to the dye as well as some minor proteins that bind albumin [59, 67] .

This method is capable of the depletion of high-abundant proteins, including different molecular forms and many proteolytic products of these proteins, coupled with low nonspecific losses of other proteins, rapidly and efficiently, in a single purification step [50, 58, 62, 65, 66 ]. An immunodepletion system based on IgY employed chicken antibodies, which orient the antibody with the antigen-binding site facing outward, with a constant portion of the antibodies covalently coupled to a solid phase material. This permits maximum antigen binding efficiency. This system also allows for the depletion of human albumin, IgG, IgA, IgM, fibrinogen, and the transferrin, and depletion of albumin in a variety of mammalian species [64] . The principal disadvantages of antibody-based depletion include its relatively high cost and low sample capacity. Fortunately, antibodies are highly robust proteins, it appears likely that such systems will last for many purification cycles if appropriate care is taken to minimize both proteolysis and column clogging. Multicomponent immunoaffinity columns have recently become commercially available [54] . Although these commercial kits are relatively expensive, they are also quite convenient and useful for small samples, such as those that can be applied to electrophoretic gels.",

Salts may also increase the conductivity of the IEF gel with increasing current. As protein focusing will not occur until these ions have moved to the end of the IEF gel, the time required for IEF will be prolonged. Salt concentrations in excess of 100 mM may induce electroendosmosis, resulting in an uneven distribution of water within the gel, and the subsequent formation of dehydration and over-hydration zones [74] .",

The spontaneous degradation of urea to cyanate can occur at room temperature. Cyanate ions remove the positive charges on amine and sulfhydryl groups in proteins (a process known as carbamylation), thereby affecting the efficiency of IEF. DTT is an effective cyanate scavenger. Rabilloud et al. reported on the utility of thiourea-containing denaturing mixtures for proteins that are highly prone to aggregation [78, 83] . The use of thiourea in combination with urea, for IEF in particular, has been determined to improve the solubilization of hydrophobic proteins [84] .

In order to inhibit this reoxidation, it was required for the alkylation of the thiol group, which results in the prevention of the precipitation of some proteins and, frequently, in the production of spurious spots in the basic pH region as the consequence of the formation of disulfide bonds. The most frequently employed reductant is DTT, which is administered at concentrations in the range of 20-100 mM; 2-mercaptoehanol is no longer widely used in carrier ampholyte IEF.

            "text": "The discovery of protein biomarkers in plasma represents a significant technical challenge. Although a variety of proteomic techniques have been attempted so far, no generally applicable technique has yet been developed for the identification of biomarkers that can replace 2-DE with regard to its ability to separate and display several thousand plasma proteins simultaneously. The selection of an appropriate blood plasma preparation method is important for confident 2-DE results. The use of anticoagulants and protease inhibitors during blood collection increases the chances for consistent results. The removal of abundant proteins using multicomponent immunodepletion systems allows us to compile profiles of proteins occurring in low concentrations in the plasma. Desalting and acetone precipitation improve the pattern generated during 2-DE, although this may result in the loss of several proteins. These techniques harbor promise for more widespread use in the preparation of samples for the identification of biomarkers that can be used in early disease detection, as well as to monitor disease progression and augment the accuracy of the prognosis using human blood plasma.",
