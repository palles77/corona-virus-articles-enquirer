Efforts to control smallpox, which involved compulsory vaccination, acted as a rallying point for groups and individuals motivated both by anti-government ideology and concrete fears of the physical harm that sometimes resulted from the procedure. anti-vaccine organizations throughout the uSa were driven, among other things, by opponents of germ theory and groups generally opposed to government interference in their claims to privacy. in Milwaukee (Wi, uSa), for example, forceful application of the State's mandatory vaccination law sparked riots among the city's large german immigrant population in the 1890s. Health officers who went into neighbourhoods to vaccinate residents and remove sick individuals to quarantine hospitals were greeted by angry mobs throwing rocks (colgrove, 2006) .",

            "text": "Efforts to impose quarantines on those viewed as a threat to public health has involved the use of measures that look excessive and profoundly unfair from the perspective of less troubled times. on several occasions, the outbreak of diseases among disfavoured minority groups has led to harsh measures being used against them. as Howard Markel noted in his book, Quarantine!, \"[i]mmigrants arriving in new york city in 1892, for example, could be isolated and kept in squalid conditions to prevent the spread of cholera and typhus. at a time of massive immigration and concomitant nativist sentiment, health officials faced little popular opposition to their efforts\" (Markel, 1997) . a central strategy of the emergent public health regime in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries involved the mandatory reporting of patients' names to public health registries. physicians attending patients in private practices often opposed such requirements as impinging on their autonomy and as a violation of the doctor-patient relationship. Biggs, when reflecting on the controversies that had greeted his efforts to mandate the reporting of tuberculosis cases-as he moved forward to begin the surveillance of sexually transmitted diseases in the early twentieth century-remarked that, \"[t]he ten year long opposition to the reporting of tuberculosis will doubtless appear a mild breeze compared with the stormy protest against the sanitary surveillance of the venereal diseases\" (Biggs, 1913) . Despite the existence of much opposition, the reporting of cases by name to local and state health departments and to special confidential registries ultimately became part of the tradition and practice of public health. u S courts almost always deferred to public health authorities that have deprived individuals of their liberty in the name of public health. one uS state high court declared at the beginning of the twentieth century that, \"[i]t is unquestionable that the legislature can confer police powers upon public officers for the protection of the public health. the maxim Salus populi suprema lex is the law of all courts in all countries. the individual right sinks in the necessity to provide for the public good\" (parmet, 1985) . Even more remarkably, a plenary grant of authority was still found to be constitutional in the 1960s. in upholding the detention of a person with tuberculosis pursuant to a statute that provided virtually no procedural protections, a california appellate court declared in 1966 that, \"[h]ealth regulations enacted by the state under its police power and providing even drastic measures for the elimination of disease\u2026in a general way are not affected by constitutional provisions, either of the state or national government.\" t he breadth of powers that public health authorities had enjoyed remained virtually unchallenged through most of the twentieth century, but finally came under increasing scrutiny during the last decades of that era. the development of a robust jurisprudence of privacy, and the \"due process revolution\", which extended rights to prisoners, mental patients and others under the authority of the state, ultimately questioned the long-held assumptions that had protected public health from constitutional scrutiny. the groundwork for this profound change was laid in the transformations that occurred in american politics, law and culture during the 1960s and 1970s. But it was the HiV/aiDS epidemic that forced a fundamental rethinking of the dominant ideology of public health. the methods of mandatory screening and examination, reporting the names of those who were sick or infected to public health registries and the imposition of quarantine once again became the subject of controversy and dispute (Bayer, 1989) .",

Fierce battles ensued when proposals were made to mandate the reporting of people infected with HiV to public health registries, and it was not until many years later that such reporting became universal. intense controversy also surrounded the efforts to preserve the right of individuals to determine whether they would be tested for HiV infection. newly adopted policies required exacting and specific informed consent for testing, and it was not until the 1990s that significant support among physicians emerged to help relax these standards. Finally, every attempt to use the power of quarantine to control those whose behaviour might place their sexual partners at risk provoked extensive debate about the counterproductive impact of recourse to coercion.",

What was true for HiV/aiDS was also true for public health generally. indeed, the experience of dealing with HiV/aiDS provided the opportunity to rethink the very foundations of public health and to re-examine the legacy of compulsory state powers.

Such measures always require that we address questions of whether the health threats, their severity and transmissibility all justify depriving individuals of their liberty. these questions cannot be answered without confronting the tension between the interests of the individual and those of the collective. if SarS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) taught us anything, it was how difficult it is to make such decisions in the face of uncertainty. it might turn out in retrospect that the quarantines we impose when faced with a potential epidemic are more extensive than necessary. But in the face of an evolving threat, public health officials have no choice but to weigh personal liberty against potential grave threats (gostin et al, 2003). t o this point i have focused on infectious diseases, which compel us to address the powers of public health when there is a direct risk or a potential risk to third parties. But the scope of public health in industrial and post-industrial societies extends to chronic diseases (Knowles, 1977) . Many such conditions involve lifestyle choices; patterns of behaviour which, in the first instance, harm oneself. What is the legitimate role of the state in modifying, discouraging, burdening or even prohibiting behaviours that increase both morbidity and mortality? at stake here is the question of paternalism. is it appropriate for the State to impose restrictions on competent adults in order to protect them from harming themselves? those who are inspired by the tradition of John Stuart Mill answer with a resounding 'no'. they claim that public health officials can educate and warn, but not compel. as these ideas have gained wide influence, advocates of public health often need to assert that they intervene because the social consequences or negative externalities of certain behaviours warrant intervention; thus, self-regarding harms are transformed into other-regarding harms. in any event, the state seeks to use its authority to change individual behaviour. two examples will illustrate this point. it has long been known that wearing helmets Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; www.cdc.gov).",

During the 1970s, pressure by the federal government in the uSa led virtually all states to mandate the use of motorcycle helmets ( Jones & Bayer, 2007) . these statutes provoked the wrath of motorcyclists who asserted that the state deprived them of the right to cycle in the way that was most pleasurable and exciting, and that failure to use helmets posed no threat to others. in short, these laws were, they asserted, an example of overreaching state intrusion, of gross paternalism. nevertheless, when the courts reviewed these statutes, they were almost never overturned as unconstitutional. a court in Massachusetts noted, \"From the moment of the injury, society picks the person up off the highway; delivers him to a municipal hospital and municipal doctors; provides him with unemployment compensation if, after recovery, he cannot replace his lost job; and if the injury causes permanent disability many assure the responsibility for his and his family's continued sustenance. We do not understand a state of mind that permits a plaintiff to think that only he himself is concerned\" (cronin, 1980) . although efforts to justify the regulation of behaviour in non-paternalistic terms might be effective in the short term, they are almost always transparent subterfuges. it would be more honest-and in the long term more protective of public health-to acknowledge that intervention is sometimes necessary to protect individuals from their own foolish or dangerous behaviour because such efforts can have a broad and enormous impact at a population level. an explicit acknowledgement would also help to understand the trade-offs involved. ironically, the use of the social impact argument can, in the end, be more subversive of rights than the explicit embrace of paternalism. after all, everything can be shown to have a social impact.",

Millions consume it because of addiction, habit, desire or social convention. it is therefore impossible to consider public policy without addressing the extent to which the state might exert pressure and impose limits in the name of health. the answer to this question will determine whether we will be able to save the lives of smokers both now and in the future.",

Here, as in the case of motorcycle helmets, there was considerable uncertainty about how far the state could go. as a consequence, much of public health policy focused on children and innocent bystanders.",

When arguments were made for radically increasing taxes on cigarettes, thus burdening consumption-especially for those with less disposable income-it was asserted that such levies were vital because of the social costs created by tobacco-associated morbidity and mortality. Finally, when increasingly restrictive measures were imposed on smoking in public settings, the central justification was that passive smoking was pathogenic and responsible for deaths associated with cancer and heart disease. it was almost never asserted that limits on advertising, increases in taxes and restrictions on public smoking were necessary to protect those who might begin to smoke or those who were smokers. as a result of changing social norms and public policies, the prevalence of smoking by adults in advanced democracies has declined markedly in the past 40 years. a steep social gradient has also emerged: those better educated smoke less; those with poorer education comprise an ever-greater proportion of smokers. under these social conditions, it has become increasingly possible to assert that the aim of restrictive public health policy is to pressure, even cajole, smokers to give up their behaviour. tobacco advertising must, where permissible, be banned. taxes must make the price of cigarettes increasingly prohibitive. limits on public smoking are necessary to make it more difficult for smokers to find a place where they can light up.",
