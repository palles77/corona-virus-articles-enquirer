Most haplotypes from the early targeted testing were of the A2 clade (143 out of 157 haplotypes) (Figure 4) . By the time we initiated the population screening, all travelers returning from ski resorts in the Alps were requested to self-quarantine and were not eligible for participating, which resulted in a substantially different composition of haplotypes. For example, the A2a2 haplotype which was most commonly seen in travelers coming from Austria in the early targeted testing was much rarer in travelers in the population screening and completely absent from those who had not traveled.",

Hence, it looks like the haplotypes of the virus that are propagating in the general population come from a different source, perhaps brought in by people coming from countries that had not yet been designated high-risk areas. Furthermore, the sequence diversity in the virus from the population screening is greater than in the original targeted screening that was focused on people coming home from skiing in the Alps. Hence, it is likely that the virus has been carried into Iceland from many countries. The 0.9% frequency of the infection in the population screening indicates that the virus is spreading to the extent that unless we increase the screening effort we are likely to fail in our efforts to contain it.",

Because of this and the rapid changes in definition of high-risk areas by the Icelandic authorities, we divide the targeted testing into early testing (Feb 1-March 15) and later testing (March 16-22). In the early targeted testing, 65.0% of those that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (positives) had recently traveled outside Iceland, while in the later targeted testing 25.1% had (",

On the other hand, a disproportionately high fraction of positives from the population screening (20.0%) had traveled to the UK, compared to the negatives (2.8%, P=9.2e-7), suggesting relatively early spread of the virus in the UK population. Eighty six percent of positives from the targeted testing reported symptoms whereas sixty six percent of those positive from the population screening reported symptoms. However, 44.2% of negative individuals also reported symptoms. Fever and body aches were most enriched among positive vs negative individuals in the population screening. Fever, coughing, and body aches were the most common symptoms among the positive in the targeted testing.

Neither carry the 24054 mutation. However, all downstream individuals carry both mutations.
