Vaccine design would be facilitated by a better understanding of the type and durability of immune responses generated by different vaccine vectors. We report here the results of a comparative immunogenicity trial of six different vaccine vectors expressing the same insert antigen, cowpox virus B5 (CPXV-B5). Of those vectors tested, recombinant adenovirus (rAd5) was the most immunogenic, inducing the highest titer anti-B5 antibodies and conferring protection from sublethal vaccinia virus challenge in mice after a single immunization. We tested select heterologous primeboost combinations and identified recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) and recombinant Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicons (VRP) as the most synergistic regimen. Comparative data such as those presented here are critical to efforts to generate protective vaccines for emerging infectious diseases as well as for biothreat agents.",

The global society is now faced with a new array of emerging or reemerging pathogens (SARS, West Nile Virus, avian influenza) against which highly effective vaccines are urgently needed [2] . In addition, the threat of bioterrorism, via the deliberate reintroduction of pathogens such as smallpox (variola) is of increasing concern. It is difficult to predict when and what type of new pathogens may emerge, thus the development of an arsenal of rapidly mobilizable vaccine platforms is highly desirable. Ideally, the creation of a panel of vaccine vectors would allow vaccine production utilizing a common platform technology. To date, this method of vaccine design has been hampered by the lack of head-to-head comparison of available vaccine vectors. The goal of this study was to compare six different vaccine vectors in a single prime-boost immunogenicity trial so that the relative immunogenicities of each individual vector as well as the most synergistic prime-boost combinations could be determined.",

The relative importance of cellular and humoral responses to the induction and maintenance of protection is an area of considerable controversy [3] , and likely differs for each pathogen. Despite this, passive transfer studies have shown that vaccine-induced antibody is sufficient to confer protection against such viral infections as measles, mumps, and varicella zoster [4] [5] [6] [7] in humans. Similarly, induction of protective antibody has been shown to be a correlate of protection in animal models of (re)emerging infections such as plague [8] , poxviruses [9, 10] , and SARS [11] . For these reasons we chose to compare vaccine vectors expressing an antigen known to induce strong humoral responses and that was important for biodefense. The vectors in this study expressed the 35kDa secreted form of poxvirus antigen B5. B5 is expressed on the outer membrane of the extracellular enveloped infectious virion (EEV) and is a target of host neutralizing antibody [12] [13] [14] . B5 is thought to be involved in long range dissemination of poxvirus virions within the infected host [15, 16] , is highly conserved among mammalian poxvirus subspecies [12, 13] , but does not induce measurable CD8 T cell responses in mice [17] [18] [19] [20] . We expressed B5 as plasmid DNA, as recombinant protein, and in non-replicating recombinant adenovirus (rAd5), highly attenuated replication competent vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV), Venezuelan encephalitis virus replicon particles (VEE-VRP), and Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smeg) vectors. Whereas recombinant adenovirus was the most immunogenic priming vector, recombinant VEE-VRP prime, VSV boost was the optimum heterologous prime-boost for induction of protective anti-B5 antibodies.",

B5 is conserved among poxviruses and has homologues among many mammalian orthopoxviruses including variola and vaccinia [12, 13] . The B5 ectodomain (B5t) encompasses four domains with resemblance to short consensus repeats (SCRs) present in complement regulatory proteins, plus a 51 amino acid stalk next to the transmembrane region [12, 28] . Epitope mapping studies have suggested that the stalk interacts with the first two SCR domains and that these regions are important neutralizing sites [14] .

Detailed description of vaccine vector construction is provided in the Methods section. Figure 1B shows a western blot of all B5 expressing vaccine vectors except for M.smegmatis. M.smegmatis expressed very low levels of the B5 protein which could not be readily detected by western blotting. All other vectors expressed robust levels of B5 protein.

Doses for each vector are listed in the Methods section and the immunization schedule is shown in Figure 1C . In order to standardize the immunization protocol as much as possible we elected to give all immunizations intramuscularly in a single 50\u00b5l injection for which the diluent was sterile saline. Thus for all priming vector studies, the only variable was dose and vaccine vector. Dosing for each vector was based on individual preliminary experiments in which the dose giving optimal immune responses was determined (dose range tested is provided in Methods). For rVSV and the VRP the dose was limited by the amount of virus that could be delivered in the 50\u00b5l inoculation volume. Primary humoral responses to B5 were assayed at four (data not shown) and six weeks ( Figure 2 ) post immunization by binding ELISA. Titers did not change significantly for any group between four and six weeks post immunization. All vectors induced detectable serum antibody titers except for M. smegmatis. Anti-B5 antibodies were not detected in any of the 48 animals immunized with M. smegmatis B5. This was potentially because the M. smegmatis vector expressed inadequate levels of B5 protein to induce a detectable immune response. All six immunization groups were compared statistically in a single ANOVA with multiple comparison analysis (Tukey). rAd5 induced significantly higher primary anti-B5 antibody titers than any other vector tested (P<10 \u22126 , ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison test). Recombinant protein with oligoCpG induced significantly higher titers than all other vectors except rAd5 at the 0.05 significance level. There were no significant differences in the anti-B5 titers induced by rVSV and VRP vectors. Titers induced by DNA were significantly lower than all other groups tested at the 0.05 significance level.",

            "text": "Six weeks after the single primary immunization all animals were boosted with a single dose of either rAd5-B5 or rVSV N4CT9 B5. These boosting vectors were chosen because both have been shown, in numerous studies, to induce synergistic responses when incorporated into heterologous prime-boosting regimens [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Additional cohorts of animals were immunized with the boosting vector alone, as a control. Serum was collected at two weeks after the boost, then at one, two, and three months post boosting and assayed individually for anti-B5 titers via binding ELISA. Anti-B5 serum Ab titers increased for all groups after boosting. Data from all groups and all time points is shown in Table 1 , with the peak titer for each group indicated by shading. Figure 3 shows the average peak titer for each prime-boost group, where each individual animal's peak titer was determined independent of the time at which that titer was reached. Average peak titers were then calculated for each group. Immunization groups fell into three \"tiers\" based on peak titer, as indicated in Table 1 . For simplicity, we discuss the statistical analyses performed using the average peak titers for each group. The overall ranking of prime-boost effectiveness was the same when we used titers at the latest timepoint (3 months post boost) versus the average peak titers calculated independent of time. In the top group, inducing the highest overall titers, were protein prime-Ad5 boost, protein prime-VSV boost, and rAd5 prime-VSV boost. An optimal prime boost regimen induces post-boost antibody titers that are a) higher than the titers achieved by primary immunization and b) higher than titers achieved by the boosting vector alone. In these experiments, all prime boost regimens (except for Ad5 prime VSV boost, P=0.0651, ANOVA) satisfied the first criteria, i.e. for all groups peak post boost titers were significantly higher than those induced by the primary immunization alone (P<10 \u22126 , ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison test) for all groups where primary titers were compared to post boost titers. A single primary immunization with rAd5-B5 induced average peak titers of 39,307. We compared the titers resulting from heterologous prime-boost regimens in which rAd5 was the boosting vector versus those induced by immunization rAd5 alone we found that the only rAd5 boosted regimen that induced significantly higher post-boost titers was protein prime-rAd5 boost (Student T test, P<10 \u22126 ). This indicates that priming with B5 protein significantly augmented the titers that could have been achieved by immunizing with rAd5 alone. For all other Ad5 boosted groups tested, the P value was greater than 0.05, indicating that there was no effect of priming. In contrast, all regimens in which rVSV was the boosting vector induced titers significantly above the primary response to rVSV, which was a GMT of 300 (for all groups P<10 \u22126 , except for M.smeg/VSV for which P=0.00376, Student T test). This indicates that priming with a heterologous vector added significantly to the titers that could have been achieved by immunizing with rVSV alone (unless the priming vector was rAd5), and suggests that rVSV was a synergistic boosting vector, while rAd5 generally was not. In order to determine quantitatively which prime boost combinations were the most synergistic we defined synergy mathematically as : synergy=log 10 (T PB /T P +T B ) where T PB is the post boost titer, and T P and T B are the titers induced by the priming and boosting vectors alone. If the post boost titer were the sum of the titers induced by the priming and boosting vectors when delivered singly, then by definition there would be no synergy and the estimated value for the synergy would be zero. The most synergistic prime boost combinations were those for which the post boost titers were the most increased relative the primary responses to both the priming and boosting vectors considered separately. By this calculation all prime-boost groups tested had positive synergy. Of these, VRP-VSV, DNA-VSV, and protein-VSV were the most synergistic prime boost combinations, and were significantly (at the 0.05 level) more synergistic than other primeboost combinations tested; the synergies within this group did not differ among themselves at the 0.05 significance level.",

            "text": "The results presented above demonstrate that most of the prime-boost regimens tested generated high titer anti-B5 antibodies. In many cases, vaccine efficacy depends not only upon the amount of antibody generated but upon the strength of binding of the immunoglobulin to the antigen. To determine whether the avidity of the anti-B5 antibodies generated differed with vaccine regimen we performed competitive binding ELISAs. The absolute amount of anti-B5 Ab between samples was equalized, and binding titers were determined in the presence of increasing molar quantities of ammonium thiocyanate (NH 4 SCN). The \"avidity index\" was defined as the amount of NH 4 SCN necessary to reduce binding by 50%. Higher avidity Ab-Ag interactions require higher concentrations of NH 4 SCN to disrupt. After the single primary immunization, animals immunized with rAd5 had the highest avidity Ab ( Figure 4A ). Antibodies from animals immunized with protein, VRP, and DNA had approximately equal avidities, which were much lower than those generated by rAd5. Antibody titers in M. smegmatis immunized animals were too low to be measured, therefore sera from those animals were not included in this analysis. An ideal vaccine regimen would induce immune response which mature (i.e. increase in avidity) over time. To determine which of our vaccine regimens fulfilled this requirement we assayed avidity at two weeks ( Figure 4B and C) and at two months ( Figure 4D and E) after the single booster immunization. Boosting with rAd5 raised and equalized avidity of Ab in all groups by two weeks post boost ( Figure 4B ) and the higher avidity Ab were maintained at the two month timepoint ( Figure 4D ). In contrast, VSV boosting did not raise avidity of the Ab in VRP or DNA primed animals by two weeks after the boost. By two months post-boost DNA-VSV animals had Ab of increased avidity, but VRP-VSV immunized animals never reached a higher avidity than those induced by VRP priming alone.",

The ability of anti-poxvirus antibodies to restrict viral spread can be assessed via \"comet assay\". Vaccinia strain IHDJ (vIHDJ) is a mutant strain producing a large number of EEV particles, which mediate long range dissemination in the infected host. In vitro, vIHDJ forms characteristic \"comets\" as EEV are released into the culture medium. When vIHDJ plaque assays are performed in the presence of antibody capable of binding and neutralizing EEV, comet tails are reduced or eliminated. Figure 5 shows results of comet assays performed using pooled post-immune sera from mice vaccinated with the B5expressing vectors. After the primary immunization, sera collected from rAd5 immunized mice was the only sample that neutralized comet formation ( Figure 5, left panel, row 6 ). After boosting with rAd5 ( Figure 5 , middle panel), or VSV ( Figure 5, right panel) , all sera tested neutralized comet formation when used at the highest amount. After boosting, comet neutralizing activity was present in all samples, even in those at which the B5 Ab was present in significantly lower quantity than in samples which failed to neutralize after the primary immunization. This shows that the ability to restrict viral dissemination in this assay is not solely a function of the amount of Ab in the serum, but reflects functional differences in the Ab itself.",

Since an immune response directed at a single poxvirus antigen rarely confers full protection from lethal challenge we decided to challenge our animals with a sublethal dose of vvWR. The sublethal dose caused significant weight loss (of up to 30% pre-challenge body weight) in naive control animals and a mortality of 50-80%. Mice were immunized intramuscularly with B5-expressing primary and boosting vectors, and three months after the boost were challenged intranasally with 1\u00d710 5 PFU vvWR.

To determine whether intranasal vaccination with B5 expressing vaccine vectors could induce primary immune responses comparable to those induced by intramuscular immunization in mice we immunized adult C57BL/6 mice with each vector and measured serum antibody titers to B5 via binding ELISA. Doses for each vector were the same as those in the intramuscular experiment and volume for all intranasal inocula was 30\u00b5l per mouse. At six weeks after the primary immunization, all three vaccine groups had significantly higher titers (P<10 \u22126 for VRP and VSV, and P=0.000158 for rAd5, ANOVA) than were generated by intramuscular immunization ( Figure 7A ). Intranasal delivery of VSV and VRP increases titers more than 10x over those generated by intramuscular delivery, while rAd5 generated titers increased 2.5x. After heterologous boosting, all animals showed greatly increased serum Ab titers, with rAd5 primed-VRP boosted animals having the highest overall titers ( Figure 7B ). In general, titers generated by intranasal prime-boosting were much higher than those generated by intramuscular immunization, with all groups having an average peak endpoint titer of at least 1:100,000. These data demonstrated that rAd5, VSV, and VRP vectors were more immunogenic when delivered intranasally, and suggests that delivering vaccines intranasally may lead to the induction of better immune responses with the same amount of antigen (dose sparing) relative the intramuscular route.",

The vaccine antigen (CPXV B5) was the same for all vectors, as was the route of immunization and volume of inoculum. Because the vaccine vectors were intrinsically different, dose could not be measured in the same units for all vectors, but was chosen in order to maximize immunogenicity of each. We also elected to use doses that could feasibly be produced using current vaccine manufacturing techniques. Recombinant adenovirus was the most immunogenic of the six priming vectors tested, inducing significantly higher serum antibody titers than the other immunizations. rAd5-induced antibodies induced were of higher avidity than those induced by the other vectors, and were the only antibodies able to reduce the spread of vaccinia EEV in vitro. In addition, a single dose of rAd5-B5 protected animals from intranasal challenge with vaccinia virus. This finding is consistent with a recent report by Kaufman et al [34] in which the authors reported that animals immunized with rAd35-based vectors expressing different poxvirus IMV and EEV Ag protected mice from lethal poxvirus challenge.",

For example, if a highly pathogenic H5N1 human-transmissible influenza strain emerges, single dose immunization with a rAd5 vector expressing the relevant H5 HA might protect vaccinated individuals. Despite the fact that rAd5 vectors are highly immunogenic, any future use of rAd vaccine vectors in humans will have to take into consideration the results of the recent Merck HIV vaccine trial [35] . In that trial human volunteers with preexisting antibodies to rAd5 and vaccinated with a rAd5 similar to the vector in this study were more vulnerable to HIV infection than individuals receiving saline [36, 37] . The mechanism by which infection was enhanced has not been determined, but one possible explanation is that rAd5 immunization of rAd5exposed individuals activated rAd-specific memory T cells. HIV preferentially infects activated memory T cells, and thus infection may have been potentiated in individuals encountering HIV during the time that rAd5-specific T cells were activated. If that is true, then rAd5-based vaccines can probably safely be used to vaccinate against pathogens that do not preferentially infect activated lymphocytes. Nonetheless, in light of the Merck trial, defining good alternatives to rAd vectors is imperative.",

The synergy of rVSV and the VEE-VRP may be due to the fact that these vectors trigger multiple and complementary pathogen recognition receptors, and that these vectors efficiently infect dendritic cells [38, 39] . All three vectors tested (rAd5, rVSV, VEE-VRP) induced significantly higher titer antibodies and better protection when delivered intranasally than when delivered intramuscularly. Intranasal delivery of these viral vectors may result in activation of a different population of antigen presenting cells, an enhanced cytokine response, or a different amount of antigen production relative intramuscular immunization. Future experiments will focus on determining the precise mechanism of enhanced protection after intranasal vaccination and whether intranasal vaccination enhances responses to all, or to a subset, of vaccine antigens.",

            "text": "The most important goal for follow-on studies arising from this work will be to identify the mechanisms responsible for the observed differences in immunogenicity between the different vectors. Factors potentially affecting relative immunogenicity of the vaccine vectors include: 1) the number and type of host cells targeted by each vector, 2) the \"adjuvanting\" effect of the vector itself due to the capacity of the vector to activate TLR or other innate pathways, 3) the amount of antigen produced by the vector and the amount of replication (if any) of the vector in vivo, 4) the duration of vector/ antigen expression, and 5) the quality of the helper T cell response induced by each vector. It is very likely that the response to the vectors could be altered by a variety of means including increasing vaccine dose (thereby increasing the amount of Ag produced), changing the route of delivery (and the number and type of target cells affected), or by adding additional adjuvants (such as those known to bind TLR). The viral vectors (rAd5, VSV, VRP) are expected to stimulate similar innate pathways, target similar numbers of host cells, and to persist for similar lengths of time. In view of this, one important question raised by these studies is why the rAd5-B5 vector was so much more immunogenic (when delivered intramuscularly) than the other viral vectors (VSV and VRP). One possibility is that differences in replication competence influenced immunogenicity. The rVSV used in these experiments is highly attenuated but can replicate in vivo [25, 26] , while the rAd5 and VRP constructs are fully replication deficient. The ability to replicate usually increases rather than decreases immunogenicity. Since the VRP and rVSV vectors were administered at similar doses (2.5\u00d710 6 PFU and 5\u00d710 6 PFU respectively) we would expect the rVSV vector to induce higher titers than the VRP vector if replication competence positively influenced the induction of humoral responses. Instead, titers generated by rVSV were not significantly different (and in fact were somewhat lower) than those generated by the VRPs. So, while we cannot conclude absolutely that replication competence did not affect the outcome of our study, it seems that other factors balanced the contribution of replication competence to immunogenicity. Interestingly, fully VSV-G deleted vectors (which do not replicate) have been shown to be of equal or greater immunogenicity to replication competent rVSV expressing the same antigen [40] . Thus it is unlikely that the immunogenicity of the VSV could have been enhanced by using a less attenuated construct. Another reason why rAd5 induced better immune responses than the VRP and rVSV vectors may have been that it was administered at a higher dose (1\u00d710 9 VP vs. 2.5-5\u00d710 6 PFU). In preliminary dose-optimization studies, higher doses uniformly induced higher Ab titers, although the fold-increase was not the same for all. This suggests that if we had been able to administer equal doses of rVSV, VRPs, and rAd5, we might have obtained immune responses of equal magnitude with all viral vectors, although qualitative differences (i.e. in affinity) may have remained. Consistent with this, delivering the three viral vectors by the intranasal rather than intramuscular route greatly decreased the disparity in response between rAd5, rVSV, and the VRPs, even though the doses of all three vectors in that experiment were the same as those used in the intramuscular trial. This demonstrates that factors other than dose (route of delivery, target organ) can profoundly influence the immune responses generated by vaccination.",
