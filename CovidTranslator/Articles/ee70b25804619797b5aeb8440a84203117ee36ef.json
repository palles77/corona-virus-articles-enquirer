The pH value in the binding assay was 7.4 respectively) were homogenous and intact, and approximately 38 nm in size. However, CsCl-purified VLPs appeared heterogeneous in size, with a few broken particles, although comparable to the morphology seen by others [7] . CsCl purification is known to introduce several impurities at the end of the process and cause aggregation of the VLPs during storage [5] . The poorest morphology was seen after concentration of the VLPs by dialysis against PEG, which resulted in aggregation. In addition, residual PEG, which leaks through the dialysis membrane, might interfere with further applications of the VLPs [19] .",

Although the majority of the VLPs purified by the CsCl method seemed intact in the EM image, the difference from sucrose-density-gradient-purified VLPs in HBGA binding is striking. This result is supported by the recent finding that CsCl has a negative impact on the functionality of VLPs [5] . We also demonstrated that even heat-disrupted VLPs have binding capability, but intact homogenous VLPs have a significantly greater binding intensity. Standardization of the purification method for NoV VLPs used in diagnostic serological assays and blocking assays [8] would greatly strengthen the results obtained.",
