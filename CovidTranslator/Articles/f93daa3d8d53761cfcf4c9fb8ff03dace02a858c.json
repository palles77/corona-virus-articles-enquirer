Here we aimed to identify arterivirus proteins involved in the mode-28 of-action of cyclophilin inhibitors and to investigate how these compounds inhibit arterivirus RNA 29 synthesis in the infected cell. Repeated passaging of the arterivirus prototype equine arteritis virus 30 (EAV) in the presence of CsA revealed that reduced drug sensitivity is associated with the emergence 31 of adaptive mutations in nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5), one of the transmembrane subunits of the 32 arterivirus replicase polyprotein. Introduction of singular nsp5 mutations (nsp5 Q21R, Y113H, or 33 A134V) led to a ~2-fold decrease in sensitivity to CsA treatment, whereas combinations of mutations 34 further increased EAV's CsA resistance. The detailed experimental characterization of engineered 35 EAV mutants harboring CsA-resistance mutations implicated nsp5 in arterivirus RNA synthesis. 36",

Subsequently, adaptive mutations that 116 markedly decreased the sensitivity of EAV replication to CsA treatment were found to map to nsp5, 117 one of the transmembrane subunits of the arterivirus replicase. We could show that CsA treatment 118 interferes with EAV RNA synthesis, and that the CsA-resistance mutations in nsp5 render replication, 119 and in particular RNA synthesis, less sensitive to CsA treatment. Furthermore, we show that resistance 120 to the closely related Cyp inhibitor ALV requires an additional adaptive mutation in nsp2, a second 121 transmembrane subunit of the arterivirus replicase that is essential for both polyprotein processing and 122 RO formation. Our studies implicate both nsp2 and nsp5 in the mechanism underlying the sensitivity 123 of arterivirus replication to cyclophilin inhibitor treatment. Moreover, they suggest that the role of 124 cyclophilins as arterivirus host factors is specifically linked to viral RNA synthesis, possibly through 125 interactions with key players in RO formation.

Independently, experiments using the CsA 426 analog ALV pointed in the same direction, in addition to implicating nsp2 in ALV sensitivity and 427 resistance. Substitutions in nsp5 and nsp2 enable EAV to tolerate CsA or ALV concentrations that 428 would normally block virus replication (Figs. 2, 9 and 10 ). The largest EC50 increase, about 5-fold, 429 was achieved when multiple substitutions in nsp5 (and nsp2, in the case of ALV) were combined 430 (Table 1 and Four substitutions in nsp5 were implicated in CsA resistance (L8S, Q21R, Y113H, and 465 A134V), of which only the L8 residue is conserved among arteriviruses (Fig. 1C) . Interestingly, this 466 residue is also part of a potential CypA binding motif (GPxL, as identified by (Piotukh et al., 2005) ), 467 constituting a potential interaction site between the two proteins. However, during infection, this L8S 468 mutation quickly reverted, and therefore the contribution of the L8S substitution to CsA resistance 469 remains unclear. All other three nsp5 mutations (Q21R, Y113H, and A134V) are present in predicted 470 transmembrane domains (Fig. 1B) , and therefore may not be directly involved in interactions of nsp5 471 with Cyps or other proteins. There is no experimental data available on the membrane topology of 472 nsp5, but upon in silico modeling these nsp5 mutations did not appreciably alter the predicted 473 conformation of the various transmembrane domains (data not shown). In addition, our EM analysis of 474 DMV formation upon rEAV nsp5 QYA infection did not reveal any ultrastructural differences, either in 475 the absence or presence of CsA (Fig 5) .

To isolate viral RNA, Huh7 cells (10-cm 2 165 dish) were infected with wild-type (wt) EAV, wtEAV P7, EAV CsA lineages, or EAV ALV lineages 166 (MOI of 0.1). Cells were incubated for 16 h at 37\u00b0C, lysed in 1 ml of TriPure (Sigma Aldrich), and 167 intracellular RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription 168 (RT) was performed with the ThermoScript\u2122 RT-PCR System (ThermoFisher Scientific) according 169 to the manufacturer's instructions, using random hexamers (Promega) and 10 \u00b5M of primer 5'-170 CGCCGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3'. Subsequently, the complete EAV genome was 171 amplified as seven PCR products and sequenced (primer sequences used in RT, PCR and sequencing 172 are available upon request). 173 174 EAV reverse genetics. Resistance-associated adaptive mutations (listed in Table 2) were introduced 175 into shuttle plasmids by standard site-directed PCR mutagenesis. After sequence verification, 176 restriction fragments containing the desired mutations were transferred to full-length EAV cDNA 177 clone pEAN900, a derivative of pEAV030 (van Dinten et al., 1997) containing a few translationally 178 silent mutations to engineer restriction sites. Virus derived from clone pEAN900 has a wt phenotype, 179 as confirmed by a side-by-side comparison with pEAV030-derived virus in growth curve experiments 180 and plaque assays (data not shown). In vitro transcribed RNA derived from wt or mutant pEAN900 181 was electroporated into BHK-21 cells using Amaxa Nucleofector technology (Lonza), as described 182 previously (Beerens and Snijder, 2007). Recombinant virus was harvested upon complete CPE, 183 typically between 48 and 72 h post transfection (p.t.). The presence of the engineered mutations was 184 confirmed by performing one additional virus passage and sequencing RT-PCR products obtained 185 after isolation and RT-PCR amplification of intracellular viral RNA. 186 187 Electron microscopy. Huh-7 cells were infected with rEAV wt or rEAV QYA , or were mock-infected, 188 and either treated with 8 \u00b5M CsA at 1 h p.i. or left untreated. Cells were fixed at 11 (no CsA) or 14 h 189 p.i. (8 \u00b5M CsA) in 1.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h. Subsequently, 190 samples were stained during 1-h incubation steps, first with 1% OsO4 in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer and 191 then with 1% uranyl acetate. Samples were then dehydrated in a graded ethanol series (70% to 100% 192 ethanol) and embedded in Epon LX-112 resin (Ladd Research) that was polymerized at 60\u00b0C. Sections 193 of 100 nm thickness were collected on carbon-coated pioloform EM grids and post-stained with lead 194 citrate and a saturated aqueous solution of uranyl acetate. Images were collected on a Tecnai12 TWIN 195 electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific (formerly FEI)) operating at 120 kV using a OneView 196 4k high frame-rate camera (Gatan). 197 198 Isolation of EAV RTC-containing replication organelles and in vitro RNA synthesis assays. 199",

Subsequently, the CsA resistance of rEAV QYA was further 315 confirmed in a low-MOI infection experiment (MOI 0.01) in Huh7 cells (Fig. 4B): a titer of about 10 4 316 PFU/ml was obtained for the mutant in the presence of 4 \u00b5M CsA, while rEAV wt infectious progeny 317 was not detected under the same conditions. 318 319 Neither CsA treatment nor nsp5 mutations affect the morphology of EAV-induced replication 320 organelles.

The incorporation of [ 32 P]CTP into viral RNA was analyzed in the presence of 368 various CsA concentrations. In the absence of the compound, in vitro synthesis of rEAV wt genomic 369 and sg RNAs was observed (Fig. 7C, lane 1), which was clearly reduced when the assay was 370 performed in the presence of \u22658 \u00b5M of CsA (lanes 3 to 6). In line with the [ 3 H]-uridine metabolic 371 labeling experiment, the RNA-synthesizing complexes from rEAV QYA -infected cells were insensitive 372 to treatment with up to 16\u00b5M of CsA (lanes 7 to 12), thus directly linking the effect of the adaptive 373 nsp5 mutations to the overall activity of the arterivirus RTC. 374 Of note, the results from both the metabolic labeling with [ 3 H]uridine and the IVRA 375experiments suggested that -compared to genome replication -sg RNA synthesis is more impaired 376 for the rEAV QYA mutant(Fig 7B, lane 1 and 3; Fig. 7C, lane 1 and 7). However, when rEAV wt and 377 rEAV QYA RNA (isolated from infected BHK-21 cells at 7.5 h p.i.) was subjected to direct 378 hybridization analysis using a [ 32 P]-labeled probe that recognizes all EAV mRNAs, an overall 379 decrease in the amount of mutant viral RNAs was visible, but no clear difference in the ratio between 380 the individual sg RNAs and genomic RNA (sFig. 2).

            "text": "3). We previously showed that CsA inhibits EAV RNA synthesis and hypothesized that 431 this may be the major determinant for its inhibitory effect (de Wilde et al., 2013a). Indeed, a 432 combination of three of the acquired CsA resistance mutations in nsp5 (Q21R, Y113H, and A134V) 433 facilitated a certain level of EAV RNA synthesis in the presence of a CsA dose that blocks wt virus 434 activity. This was observed in both virus-infected cells and an in vitro assay for EAV RNA synthesis 435 (Fig. 7). 436 Unfortunately, arterivirus nsp5 has not been studied in great detail and little is known about its 437 functions and interactions during virus replication. The protein is one of three ORF1a-encoded 438 transmembrane subunits that are presumed to drive the formation of the membranous ROs supporting 439 viral RTC activity in the infected cell (Knoops et al., 2012; Pedersen et al., 1999; van der Hoeven et 440 al., 2016). In expression systems, nsp2 and nsp3 interact and their combined expression suffices to 441 induce the conversion of ER membranes into double-membrane vesicles that strikingly resemble those 442 observed in arterivirus-infected cells. Although nsp5 appears to be dispensable for the basic 443 interactions leading to these membrane transformations (Snijder et al., 2001), the protein was recently 444 postulated to play a regulatory role by modulating membrane curvature and DMV formation (van der 445 Hoeven et al., 2016). 446 The 162-amino acid nsp5 of EAV is largely hydrophobic and contains four predicted 447 membrane-spanning domains and a cytosolic C-terminal domain (Fig. 1 and (van der Hoeven et al., 448 2016)). In infected cells, nsp5 is mainly present within a number of long-lived processing 449 intermediates of the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins (Snijder et al., 1994; Wassenaar et al.encoded part of the replicase polyprotein, which includes key enzymes for arterivirus RNA 452 synthesis (Snijder et al., 1994; Wassenaar et al., 1997). Consequently, nsp5 may have an important 453 role as an 'interaction platform' that could target and/or anchor other RTC subunits to membranes. 454 Being part of several larger processing intermediates, nsp5 may potentially perform such a role in cis, 455 prior to the proteolytic release of those other subunits from nsp5-containing precursors. Obviously, 456 also host cell proteins involved in arterivirus RNA synthesis are likely to become associated with the 457 membrane-bound viral RTC, and may thus interact with nsp5. Such factors may include CypA and 458 other members of the Cyp family that bind CsA and ALV, although the possibility of a direct 459interaction of these compounds with EAV replicase subunits themselves has not been formally 460 excluded. In any case, our EM analysis of CsA-treated, EAV-infected cells, which were devoid of 461 DMVs(Fig. 5), confirmed that the drug treatment blocks an early and basic step in the viral replicative 462 cycle, and that this block can apparently be circumvented by the acquisition of a few adaptive 463 mutations in nps5. 464",

Interestingly, no 480 CypA cosedimentation with RTCs was detected in the presence of CsA (de Wilde et al., 2013a). 481Unfortunately, co-immunoprecipitation experiments using lysates from either ectopic expression of 482 the EAV nsp2-7 polyprotein in 293T cells or EAV-infected cells, could not confirm an interaction 483 between nsp5 and CsA, even when using mild conditions for cell lysis and immunoprecipitation (data 484 not shown). This could obviously be due to technical reasons, e.g. the interaction being very weak or 485 short-lived but an alternative explanation may be that the interaction of CypA with the EAV RTC is 486 not directly via nsp5, or that it depends on factors that were lacking in our assays. 487Although a direct interaction between an EAV nsp and CypA could not be established, 488 efficient EAV replication is dependent on the presence of CypA, as it is severely reduced in cells 489 depleted for CypA(Fig 6; (de Wilde et al., 2013a; de Wilde et al., 2018b)). For HCV, it was 490 postulated that the interaction between CypA and NS5A is involved in the formation and stabilization 491 of the RO, the so-called 'membranous web' with which viral RNA synthesis is associated (Chatterji et 492 al., 2015; Madan et al., 2014). A direct interaction has been demonstrated between CypA and the 493 proline-rich domain 2 of NS5A (Foster et al., 2011; Ngure et al., 2016). Presumably, CypA catalyzes 494 the proper folding of NS5A, which in turn enhances the direct binding of RNA to NS5A, or 495 recruitment of the NS5B-RdRp to the membrane structures, ultimately leading to efficient RNA 496 synthesis (Coelmont et al., 2010). HCV mutations associated with resistance to Cyp inhibitors map to 497 NS5A, close to the cleavage site between NS5A and NS5B, and either slow down processing of the 498 NS5A-5B junction or render replication less dependent on CypA (Kaul et al., 2009). Interestingly, 499 NS5A mutations that confer resistance to Cyp inhibitors do not reduce CypA-NS5A binding (Badillo 500 et al., 2017). 501 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

CsA may thus also affect the stability of virus-induced membrane structures and by 511 doing so inhibit viral RNA synthesis, for example by disrupting the integrity of the viral RTC or its 512 association with the ROs.
