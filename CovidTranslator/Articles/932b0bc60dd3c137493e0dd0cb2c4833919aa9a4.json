The purpose of the ALPHA Project is to develop a software application architecture based on the philosophy of configuring and reusing common components to produce services that would be used to enable faster development of robust, maintainable public health applications. Public health is practiced through complex relationships of organizations (e.g., local, federal) and functionally organized units (e.g., health departments, disease programs) [9] . As such, the emphasis of the project is not on creating one monolithic application to handle all public health surveillance needs, but rather on creating customizable applications with the same underlying architectural or component structure. The goal is to reduce the amount of new development work required for each new application, in order to reduce its time-to-market. Configuration plays an increasingly larger role in the development cycle, and leads to more flexible applications responsive to new and emerging public health needs. New components or services that have to be built are designed in such a way that other applications can use them, and contribute to the architecture. Consequently, software becomes more maintainable, since applications share many of the same components.",

            "text": "\u2022 Flexibility: Tracking and monitoring diseases is a dynamic activity. Emerging diseases, such as SARS can appear very quickly, requiring public health officials and surveillance applications to respond just as quickly [10] . When a disease outbreak occurs, it is essential that the technology tools be in place to track cases and contact information. Public health officials do not have the luxury of time to develop systems in response to each disease outbreak. An application must be flexible to handle new diseases [10] . In addition, given the possible links between outbreak events, epidemiologists analyzing data collected by a surveillance system may need to gather different data as they discover new information. A surveillance application must be able to adapt to these changing data and analysis requirements. \u2022 Maintainability: Applications are inherently expensive to maintain. The cost of supporting a deployed software product can be between 60 and 80% of its lifetime cost [11, 12] . The greater the degree of heterogeneity that exists in the application suite available for an organization, the more expensive it is to maintain. For example, different applications tend to use different technologies and different versions of third party software. Keeping track of all the applications' technology version matrices can be complex, and the licensing costs can be expensive. Making viable the sharing of common architectural components among applications reduces support complexity and licensing costs. \u2022 Jurisdictional configurability: Each jurisdiction collecting public health surveillance data has its own policies or business rules governing the content and format of data to be collected. For instance, larger jurisdictions may be able to collect last names of their subjects, while smaller jurisdictions may only be allowed to collect their initials. Similarly, some jurisdictions may want to include the complete date when collecting a birth date, while others can only record the month and the year. An application distributed to different jurisdictions must be able to handle these variations in policy. Furthermore, since policies can change within jurisdictions, established or already implemented applications must be readily configurable. \u2022 Alert notifications: A core requirement of a surveillance application is to send alert notifications to designated people indicating that a certain event has occurred. An event could be the occurrence of two or more cases of a similar disease being reported in potentially multiple jurisdictions within a certain time frame (i.e., outbreak). Another event may raise attention to data anomalies within a case that requires attention. An event could even be a user accessing an application after hours. Events such as these help users to manage their applications and understand the data being stored. Alerts could take the form of an email notification, a message sent to a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)/cell phone, or a posting to a web site. \u2022 Security: Due to the sensitive nature of public health surveillance data, security is of the utmost concern. One area of concern within security is authorization. Particular individual users of applications may only see a subset of the data, and only certain functions of the application depending upon their role. For instance, if an application collects data from different jurisdictions, a public health official in one jurisdiction should not be able to see data collected in another jurisdiction. Furthermore, access to different parts of the application should be restricted only to those who are authorized. Auditing functions can also assist in monitoring what applications and which data are being accessed by a specific user. \u2022 Usability: Prior to the analysis and reporting of public health information, data must exist in a repository. Currently, data collection poses the single most resource intensive component of surveillance cost, since data must be manually entered into a repository. A disease case can require the collection of, potentially, a few hundred data elements. Based on our experiences, data entry clerks often complain of user interfaces being crowded with irrelevant data fields since not all data elements need to be collected for a case. To reduce this overhead associated with data collection, the presentation of a surveillance application interface must optimize data entry and filter out irrelevant data. \u2022 Data sharing: Public health surveillance applications collect data about different diseases from different demographics. This data is usually stored in different databases. Valuable information could be discovered if field entries from these databases were cross-referenced, and in line with existing legislation and privacy controls stored in a central database. The Pan-Canadian Electronic Health Record project by Canada Health Infoway is a multi-year initiative focussed on integrating Canadian surveillance systems from a data perspective [13] . To support this important objective, a surveillance application must have the capability of sharing data with other applications. \u2022 Statistical analysis and reporting tools: Once data has been collected and entered into the system, epidemiologists and other public health professionals must be able to analyze the data and report on its contents. A number of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) statistical analysis and reporting tools adequately support this requirement. Thus, PHAC has elected to integrate COTS products into the surveillance environment to support this need.",

In the RODS system, data is collected from patients' chief complaints during emergency department visits, as well as patient registration at acute care clinics. After removing patient identifying information, the data is automatically sent to the RODS system using a Health Level-7 (HL7) message. The RODS HL7 listener parses this message and routes it to a Bayesian text classifier, which assigns it to a syndromic category. The data is then stored in the database for other applications to use. This data can then be analyzed to detect disease and bioterrorism outbreaks. The RODS system is deployed within several health systems in the United States.",

Therefore, the architecture, in order to be successful, must be flexible enough to allow both existing and new applications the ability to adapt to new surveillance targets so that surveillance officers can collect and analyze their data efficiently. In the ALPHA architecture, the data elements and data types collected within IDSS were easily modified after the surveillance officer required different data elements. Also, in another application, the Canadian Tuberculosis Reporting System (CTBRS), we were able to adapt to a set of different disease data forms. In both cases, the changes were made through configuration without modifying the underlying code. Another key to the success of an architecture for public health applications is that the applications should assist users to enter or retrieve data efficiently so they can spend less time on administrative tasks and more time on their primary work (e.g., health care professionals spend more clinical time with patients, surveillance officers and analysts spend more time analyzing data).

Consequently, there will be a drop in costs associated with each new application. In the ALPHA architecture, the ESCSY survey application took three developers 5 months to design and develop. By the time the third survey application was built, it only took one developer 1 month to configure the necessary Survey, Alert/Notification and Policy Services. Furthermore, IDSS took five developers 9 months to design and develop, but a similar surveillance application, CTBRS, took one developer only 3 months to configure the necessary Disease Access, Alert/Notification and Policy Services. Once again, the increased reliance on application configuration rather than development allowed the ALPHA architecture to meet these goals.",

We have addressed this issue using the Profiler Component and, more specifically, a service such as the Disease Access Service in IDSS. This Service only presents the necessary data elements to a user based on their role, privileges and interest. Therefore, a data entry clerk does not have to sort through a screen full of irrelevant data elements in order to enter data into one or two fields. Furthermore, most of the field surveillance officers enter data onto paper forms that data entry clerks enter into the system. We are currently investigating the feasibility of using Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) that can be distributed to the field in order for the data to be entered once and synchronized with the application at the end of each day. This will help automate the data entry process. An issue still to be resolved is the privacy concerns of information stored and transferred using a PDA.",
