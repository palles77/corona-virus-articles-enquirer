The process of collecting and transmitting data is being standardized through the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS). 12 The Federal component in the Figure depicts the role of the federal government in outbreak detection. Part of this role is defined by the U.S. Constitution, in the event that outbreak detection is needed for the defense of our country against bioterrorism or as part of the regulation of interstate commerce (e.g., federal inspections of meat products sold in interstate commerce). The federal government also contributes to outbreak detection by providing specialized research networks, specialized experts, and advanced laboratories.

This communication and data sharing is necessary because infectious disease outbreaks do not respect governmental boundaries.

For each outbreak, we determined how the outbreak was first detected using information provided in the MMWR report. When an article specified that individual cases were reported to the health department, we classified the outbreak as having been detected by the health department through an aggregation of individual reports. When possible, we calculated the time to detection using as the starting point the reported date of onset of illness in the first individual. We also grouped the outbreaks into previously described detection categories 24 with one modification-we split the commercial product category into \"commercial distribution\" and \"foodborne (noncommercial)\" categories. The rationale for this modification was that we found reports of a number of foodborne outbreaks that occurred in noncommercial settings (U.S. Army, schools) or that did not appear to be linked to commercial food distribution.",
