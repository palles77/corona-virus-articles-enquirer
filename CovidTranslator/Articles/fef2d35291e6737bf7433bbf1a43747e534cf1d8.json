Demyelination was observed in optic nerve fibres arising from the eyes of mice which received a single rTNF injection. No such changes were detected when heat-inactivated rTNF was injected with the label. The effects of intravitreal injection of rTNF on the pathophysiology of mouse optic nerve resembled those found in mice infected with Semliki Forest virus (SFV), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. We suggest that TNF could mediate at least some of the pathophysiological changes found in SFV-infected mice and may provide a clue concerning the disease mechanism in multiple sclerosis.",

This is achieved via a fast axonal transport system which continuously shuttles membranous organelles containing proteins and glycoproteins along microtubules (Schnapp and Reese 1986) . Changes in components of fast axonal transport could therefore lead to abnormal interaction with myelin, leading ultimately to demyelination.",

Our laboratory demonstrated a significant in- crease in the amounts (but not the rates) of proteins and glycoproteins transported to optic nerve endings prior to optic nerve demyelination in mice infected with Semliki Forest virus (SFV) (Tansey and Ikeda 1986; Jenkins and Ikeda 1991; Jenkins et ai. 1991) , a well-documented model of central nervous system demyelination (Atkins et al. 1985) . These events were mediated by the immune system, since T ceU-deficient nude mice showed neither increased axonal transport nor demyelination following SFV inoculation (Fazakerly and Webb 1987; Jenkins et al. 1988 ). Moreover, when nude mice were reconstituted with T cells from immunocompetent nu/+ littermates, both increased axonal transport and optic nerve demyelination was restored (Jenkins et al. 1988 ). These results suggest that increased axonal transport and demyelination in SFV-infected mice are both T-cell-dependent, and the axonal transport change is a causative factor for demyelination.",

To our knowledge, the effects of TNF on the visual system have previously only been studied by Brosnan et al. (1989) . These workers found that human recombinant TNF (rTNF) caused a delay in the visually-evoked cortical potential which was associated with inflammatory changes in the rabbit retina, rTNF has been shown to cause myelin damage in organotypic cultures of mouse spinal cord axons (Selmaj and Raine 1988) , but the in vivo effect of rTNF on optic nerve myelin does not appear to have been examined. Recently, Simmons and Willenborg (1990) demonstrated that injection of rTNF into rat spinal cord caused an inflammatory response, similar to events observed in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, but its effect on myelin does not appear to have been followed up.",

The injections were made into the centre of the vitreous through the superior temporal portion of the sclera at a point approximately 0.7 mm behind the limbus margin, at an angle of 40\u00b0-50 \u00b0 with reference to the equator of the eyeball. To prevent a rapid increase in the intraocular pressure and reflux of fluid, the injection was made slowly over a period of 2 min using a fine hydraulically controlletl pipette (tip diameter, 60-80/~m) and silicone fluid was applied over the scleral penetration point following the injection. While under deep sodium pentobarbitone anaesthesia (Sagatal, 50 mg/kg; May & Baker Ltd.), experimental mice received 2-/~1 intravitreal injections containing either: (1) 1 p.Ci of t.-2,3,4,5-[aH]proline stock solution (1 mCi/ml; 122 Ci/mmol; Amersham International plc) together with rTNF into one eye, or (2) rTNF followed by 1/.~Ci [3H]proline 24 h later.

Note that the optic nerve section taken from the rTNF-injected eye has a pale mottled appearance in the peripheral portions of the nerve trunk. lowing intravitreal rTNF was similar to that seen in immuno-competent SFV-infected mice several days prior to optic nerve demyelination (Tansey and Ikeda 1986; Jenkins at al. 1988 ). The effect of rTNF on axonal transport was found to be dose-dependent as Table 1 shows. The greater the dose of rTNF, the greater the percentage increase in the amount of radiolabelled protein at the superior colliculus. Fig. 2 shows a typical light micrograph of an optic nerve section obtained from a mouse which received a single intravitreal injection of rTNF (10 units), compared to its control which received heat-inactivated rTNF. The nerve from the rTNF-Jnjected eye has a pale halo-like appearance and contains a region which is mottled and paler still, indicating demyelinating lesions, whilst the control nerve section obtained from the eye which received heat-inactivated rTNF shows no mottled regions. Approximately 70% of the optic nerve sections from the r-TNF-injectea eyes (15-20 sections from each of the 3 nerves) showed a mottled appearance (as shown in Fig. 2) to varying degress. The lesions were focal throughout, just as those found in optic nerve sections obtained from mice infected with SFV (Tansey et al. 1985) . Control nerve sections (n = 50) were, on the other hand, evenly stained and showed no sign of demyelination. It thus appears that rTNF is capable of producing demyelination similar to that following SFV infection.",

Indeed, electron micrographs of the nerves from rTNF-infected eyes revealed significant pathology. An example is shown in Fig. 3 which compares an electron micrograph of an optic nerve section from a mouse which received rTNF with another from an eye which received heat-inactivated rTNF. Whilst densely packed myelinated axons and oligodendrocyte processes are seen in the control nerve (Fig. 3B) , extensive fibriUar astrocytic processes and some myelin destruction near a blood vessel are apparent in the nerve from the rTNF-injected eye (Fig. 3A) . To illustrate that the rTNF-induced changes are patchy and varied in their severity throughout the optic nerves, Fig. 4A shows a region of an optic nerve trunk with both myelin destruction and axonal damage, whereas another (Fig.  4B) , taken from the same nerve, shows many normal myelinated axons together with some minor signs of myelin destruction close to a blood vessel.",

This could suggest that an increase in uptake and incorporation of [3H]proline in the retina occurred in response to the rTNF injection. For example, histological signs of inflammatory changes have been shown in rabbit retina between 3 and 24 h after a single intravitreal rTNF injection (Brosnan et al. 1989) . However, radiolabel incorporation in the retina showed no change (Fig. 1B) , and the half-life of free proline in the mouse vitreous is only one hour (Nixon 1980) . The increase in amounts of axonally transported protein which we found in mice after the rTNF injection must therefore have been a specific and rapid response of retinal ganglion cells. Moreover, since intravitreal injection or rTNF 24 h prior to the [3H]proline injection did not result in altered labelling of either retinae or superior colliculi (Fig. IA) , whatever the structural or inflammatory changes rTNF may have caused in mouse retina, they were insufficient to promote increased axonal transport of protein. The dose-dependent effect of rTNF on the level of axonally transported protein (Fig. 2 ) may thus reflect a receptor-mediated response by retinal ganglion cell bodies.",

The following information supports this hypothesis. Firstly, TNF is released by mononuclear cells in direct response to virus particles (Aderka et al. 1986 ) and it possesses anti-viral properties to both RNA and DNA virus infections in several different cell types (Wong and Geoddel 1986) . Secondly, infiltration of the retina and optic nerve by inflammatory cells has been demonstrated in SFV-infected mice (Illavia et al. 1981; Pathak and Webb 1988) . Thirdly, in addition to T-cell-activated macrophages, T-cells themselves release TNF (Steffen et al. 1988; Limb et al. 1989) .",

This is the first in vivn study showing rTNF mediates increased axonal transport of protein in the ortic nerve and, after some de;ay, demyelinat~on. The consequences of TNF's action er aeuronal physiology could range from the subtle to the extreme. We have suggested that intercellular communication between optic nerve axons and myelin may be disturbed due to TNF's action on retinal ganglion cells, and that this may lead to demyelination. It is also possible, moreover, that TNF is responsible for acute symptoms seen in early stages of SFV-mediated demyelinating disease or multiple sclerosis, e.g. paralysis.",
