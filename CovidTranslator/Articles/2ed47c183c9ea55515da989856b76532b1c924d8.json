It might be expected that \u1e0a O 2 would therefore decrease. Surprisingly, as the Hct decreases to 30%,\u1e0aO 2 actually increases over baseline. This is because hemodilution alters the rheologic properties of blood. Blood viscosity is decreased by hemodilution, which effectively lowers systemic vascular resistance (SVR). An increase in venous return results in an increased stroke volume. CO increases proportionally more than CaO 2 decreases, and \u1e0a O 2 rises. Furthermore, the rise in CO is accomplished without an increase in heart rate, if intravascular volume is maintained. Hemodilution to a Hct of 30% causes a 30-50% increase in CO.\u1e0aO 2 does not fall to control values until a Hct of approximately 20% is reached. Additionally, during isovolemic hemodilution, local tissue oxygenation is preserved and even enhanced by a more homogeneous distribution of capillary blood flow.

Cases ideally suited for cell salvage are those where surgical bleeding is confined to a discrete area. Blood loss occurring slowly over a wide area is difficult to collect. Typically, because of losses from the surgical field and those occurring during processing, approximately 50% of shed blood is returned to the patient. Recovery may be higher in some cases, such as abdominal aortic aneurysm resection, where blood loss is well localized. Use of intraoperative cell salvage has had a great impact in vascular surgery, orthopedic surgery, and cardiac surgery. It has also been commonly used in urologic, trauma, transplantation, and neurosurgical procedures. Not only has the average homologous blood requirement decreased, but the percentage of patients requiring no homologous blood products has sharply increased, from 4% to 68% in one study involving vascular surgery patients. Another study from a major center demonstrated that 17% of the total institutional red cell requirement was obtained by intraoperative cell salvage.",

            "text": "It has been demonstrated that during oncologic surgery tumor cells may survive processing and be suspended, along with red cells, for transfusion back to the patient. Thus, some experts feel that intraoperative cell salvage should not be used during oncologic surgery. However, it has not been demonstrated that transfusion of malignant cells results in dissemination of the tumor. In many forms of cancer, tumor cells may be recovered from blood despite the fact that blood-borne spread does not occur. There is particular reason for wishing to avoid the use of homologous transfusion in oncologic surgery. Homologous transfusions have been shown to produce an immunosuppressive effect, resulting in earlier tumor recurrence and decreased survival times in patients with some forms of cancer. Intraoperative cell salvage may be advantageous in such cases. One group of studies has looked at outcome of cell salvage in patients undergoing major urologic oncologic procedures. No evidence of blood-borne dissemination or high tumor recurrence rates was found in these patients. Use of cell salvage in such cases has been recommended by some. It is possible to compromise by using the cell salvage suction during dissection of tumor-free areas, while employing a separate suction to collect and discard material during actual tumor dissection. Nonetheless, more clinical studies will be necessary to fully resolve this issue. In abdominal trauma, shed blood is frequently contaminated by intestinal contents. Because of red cell binding, bacteria survive processing by cell salvage equipment and can be transfused back to the patient. Whether transfusion of such contaminated blood contributes to the morbidity is questionable. Many experts feel that such patients are exposed to a bacterial load by the nature of their injuries. Prophylactic antibiotics significantly reduce the risk of sepsis. Consequently, there is little additional danger from bacteria in salvaged blood, and patients are spared the dangers associated with homologous blood. Some authors feel that salvaged contaminated blood should be used only as a lifesaving measure when no other blood is available. A definitive answer to this question awaits further clinical trials.",

If blood is donated too close to the date of surgery, with insufficient time for the resynthesis of red cells to compensate for the amount removed, patients can be relatively anemic at the time of surgery and tend to leave the hospital with a lower Hct compared with controls. However, if blood is collected at a suitable interval before surgery, so that substantive erythropoiesis can occur, PABD can be a highly effective method of preventing exposure to homologous blood. A survey of 1,000 hospitals recently found that PABD is the most commonly practiced method of blood conservation. Its use is widely accepted by patients, and in some states in the United States (California), discussion of PABD is mandatory as part of informed consent for any operation in which blood transfusion is likely. AIHD has the advantage of being inexpensive, and is a \"point-of-care\" intervention. It obviates the need for weeksin-advance planning and eliminates the risk of administrative error associated with stored blood. A number of clinical studies purport to show that it is of comparable efficiency, with less cost, to PABD or cell salvage. However, other studies, as well as mathematical models, have shown that the amount of red blood cells saved by AIHD is quite small and usually clinically insignificant. For AIHD to be clinically useful, both low Hct and large surgical blood losses must be safely tolerated. A number of authors have raised concerns about the iatrogenic introduction of risk in patients with previously unappreciated cardiac disease from moderate or profound hemodilution. Because of such concerns, the use of AIHD is probably of limited benefit to older patients. Its use is probably least controversial, and of greatest benefit, in pediatric or young adult patients with a low likelihood of unappreciated cardiac disease, who are not anemic, and who are having surgeries with large anticipated blood loss.",
