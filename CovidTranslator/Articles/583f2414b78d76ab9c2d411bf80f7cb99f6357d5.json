Its aim is to help the international community prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide. The stated purpose and scope of the IHR are \"to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade.\" The IHR has been used for the H1N1 pandemic crisis [77] .",

Since its creation, WHO has indeed played a significant role in the global harmonization of pharmaceutical regulations. As per its mandate and the responsibilities defined in its constitution, it has developed and maintained numerous international standards, norms, guidelines, classifications, and nomenclatures through a rigorous, international, and independent scientific consultative process. In addition to this normative role, WHO has also established important networks to facilitate global cooperation. For example, ICDRAs has been an important player in global regulatory harmonization. It launched many projects that have facilitated and promoted harmonization and cooperation between countries [79].",

Indeed, this program has been very positive and its scope has continually been extended since its creation in 2001. It has clearly accelerated the access of essential medicines worldwide (especially in low and middle income countries) [80] . This model should be used to further develop regional and global collaboration for medicine evaluation. The example of the 2010/2011 pilot WHO/East African Community (EAC) collaborative procedure initiated to facilitate registration of prequalified medicines in the EAC [81] was positive. The overall aim was to identify a framework for WHO/EAC, for joint evaluation and approval of dossiers and inspections of medicine manufacturing sites, and to ensure that these assessments are integrated into national regulatory decision making. Two assessors each from three EAC countries (Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda) and six WHO assessors jointly assessed two product dossiers submitted by a single manufacturer. The dossiers were submitted in parallel, and with identical content, to each participating EAC country and to WHO. The products were both prequalified. The principal benefit of this joint assessment was that once the products had been jointly assessed and approved by WHO/EAC, they were granted immediate access to the markets of each of the countries that had participated in the joint assessment. Also, such joint assessment contributes to harmonization of regulatory requirements at the regional level. This pilot WHO/EAC project also exemplifies the role of WHO in providing technical assistance to countries and supporting local capacity building. Indeed, by acknowledging the important role of adequate systems to implement sound and effective pharmaceutical regulation, WHO has supported developing countries in addressing their deficiencies or capacity problems through various types of training, assessment of regulatory capacity, and the recommendation of institutional development plans. These activities have been very beneficial in the past, but work needs to continue and grow in this domain, as problems still exist. Indeed, the extent of implementation of standards varies from one region to another. There are a number of factors that explain observed weaknesses of medicine regulation, and these differ from country to country and depend also on the individual health systems. Countries may vary regarding their registration system, and not all of them can implement a comprehensive medicine evaluation and registration system. Also, WHO encourages regional and international collaboration among national DRAs in order to promote the harmonization of requirements and practices, and to strengthen professional competence [82] . However, as recognized in its Medicine Strategy Plan, cooperation with regional harmonization initiatives and organizations should be further enhanced [83] . Closer cooperation and coordination should also be sought with other global initiatives such as ICH.",

These networks facilitate lively cooperation between scientists across nations and allow governments to jointly tackle global health problems. Development and promotion of global norms and standards in medicine is one of WHO's efforts that is widely perceived as being in an area in which WHO has a comparative advantage. This advantage is due to the recognition of WHO as the global leader and coordinating authority on global public health. The achievement of the MDGs and the renewal of primary healthcare are indeed unthinkable without WHO's norms and standards, policy guidelines, and technical cooperation. This is why the development and promotion of global norms and standards are an area of continued focus for WHO [84] . It is indeed critical that WHO continue its work towards better harmonization and cooperation in the pharmaceutical domain. Acknowledging the unique neutral and independent role of WHO, its numerous successes in the past, and its nearly universal membership, it would be appropriate to further extend the leadership of WHO in this domain.

Differences between guidelines can result in obstacles to the mutual use and acceptance of clinical data. At the Steering Committee meeting in September 1998, it was agreed that this should be adopted as a new area of work for ICH, with the first such guideline being undertaken as a \"pilot study\" to assess the feasibility of extending work in this area.

Moreover, the submission's content may also be different for several reasons, such as different individual regulations, legal status, or requirements, and different manufacturing situations for the three regions. Indeed, although the CTD provides a common format for regulatory applications, the actual content must still meet local regulations, laws, and statutes. As a result, despite being presented in the same order, the required content of Modules 2 to 5 may vary by region. For example, the Integrated Summary of Efficacy/Integrated Summary of Safety (ISE/ ISS) that were requested by the US FDA before the implementation of the CTD are still needed. Because these integrated summaries are unique to the US, the Table of Contents of the CTD does not specifically include them. A specific US FDA guidance was released in June 2007 to help pharmaceutical companies decide where to place these US-specific ISE/ISS documents within the structure of the CTD.",

In response to a growing interest from beyond the ICH regions in the use of ICH guidelines, the ICH Steering Committee took the first step in March 1999 of establishing the ICH GCG. In November 2003, new terms of reference and rules were endorsed for the GCG with the aim of establishing partnerships beyond the ICH regions to promote a better understanding of ICH guidelines globally. Since then, RHIs from across the globe, but also representatives from DRAs and Departments of Health (DoH) that are either a major source of API or clinical trials data have been invited to participate in the GCG meetings and listen to technical topics at the level of the Steering Committee (at the biannual ICH meetings). In addition, as per a decision of the ICH Steering Committee in November 2010, invited RHIs and DRAs/DoH may now also nominate technical experts as active members of ICH EWGs.

This joint effort allows not only for the involvement of the best experts (from both the authorities and pharmaceutical industries) in specific technical discussions, but also for ensuring that discussions take into account both the regional legislations and the practical impact on the development of pharmaceutical products. This inclusion of both industry and regulators increases commitments to the common goal (i.e., implementation of the ICH tripartite, harmonized guidelines, and recommendations) that has obviously been a key factor in the success of ICH.

The Steering Committee has of course also been key as the governing body that gives direction, selects the topics for harmonization, and ensures completion of projects in a timely manner (not always easy when one's goal is consensus). In addition to the structure, the Steering Committee has also been able to define a process that supported this incredible harmonization task in a structured and organized way, supported by different players such as the ICH Secretariat and coordinators. Indeed, the stepwise approach that has been put in place for the development of guidelines (the defined five-step process with decision points at Step 2 and Step 4) has been very important. This approach allowed for the creation of comprehensive drafts by a small number of experts (the best environment for facilitating focused discussion and development of consensus) and public review before implementation (which promotes transparency, and avoids surprises and post-approval issues). The creation of Concept Papers and Business Plans that the Steering Committee put in place at a later stage are also fundamental to (1) define clear goals, and (2) help to monitor progress towards the predefined goals.

To increase transparency and promote collaboration outside ICH regions, the Steering Committee accepted observers (e.g., Canada), worked with other international organizations (EFTA and WHO), and involved other regions/countries in this process via the ICH GCG, which evolved over time.

This diversity is a positive attribute of the Union. However, considering the 24 official languages and the major historic, social, cultural, and economic differences between Member States, its development has not been easy. Its diversity has also influenced its organization and the way the harmonization process has been structured. It is therefore very important to understand the history and organization of the EU in order to understand how the European pharmaceutical regulation has been structured over time. effectively alone and where cooperative action at the community level is indispensable. These include major health threats and issues with a cross border or international impact, such as pandemics and bioterrorism, as well as issues relating to free movement of goods, services, and people. Acknowledging that all countries share common values (i.e., ensure high standards of public health and equity in access to quality healthcare), it is therefore logical that the EU has developed common standards for medicines. Moreover, the implementation of a single market requires harmonization of the pharmaceutical market. The ability to travel freely, or to live and work anywhere in the EU, only makes sense if EU citizens can be sure to obtain the same level of healthcare wherever they go. Therefore, a number of European Community rules have been adopted to ensure the highest possible degree of protection of public health while promoting the free movement of medicines in an internal market without barriers. The European Commission (EC)'s role is not to mirror or duplicate national activities, but to coordinate them. Work on healthcare at the community level adds value to Member States' actions, particularly in the area of illness prevention, including activity on the safety and efficacy of medicines [99] .",

Concerned Member States were continuing to assess applications. Regarding the Centralized Procedure, it was felt that it should be opened up to a broader range of products and that the \"decision-making process\" of the Commission (post-CPMP opinion) should be reduced and improved.

Following its entry into force and its associated rules and guidelines, the number of orphan medicines authorized has increased significantly [134] . This Directive's aim is to protect public health while securing the free movement of herbal medicines within the Community. While most individual herbal medicines will continue to be licensed nationally by Member States, the process for licensing and information on herbal substances and preparations will be increasingly harmonized across the EU. For example, in order to further integrate these special medicines in the European regulatory framework, a Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products (HMPC) was established at the EMA in September 2004 (replacing the CPMP Working Party on Herbal Medicinal Products). The major tasks of this scientific Committee are to establish Community monographs for traditional herbal medicines, and to prepare and maintain a list of herbal substances that have been in medicinal use for a sufficient period of time, and so are not considered to be harmful under normal conditions of use [135] .",

The overall feedback from sponsors was positive, except that: Directive 2001/20/EC and its associated texts and guidelines are a very important step in the harmonization of procedure for the registration and conduct of clinical trials in Europe. Implementation of this Clinical Trials Directive into national legislation of all 27 EU Member States was completed in 2006. Principles like Clinical Trial Authorization by the national DRAs within defined maximum timelines led to significant harmonization of the clinical trial approval process. However, it has been agreed that this new system needs further harmonization in order to achieve the ultimate objective [142] . Indeed, the actual assessment of a request for authorization of a clinical trial is done independently by the Member States concerned. The legislation does not provide for a mechanism whereby the Member States are obliged to reach a common conclusion regarding a clinical trial involving different Member States. This lack of obligation and detailed direction implied different interpretation from Member States and therefore created implementation issues. As a consequence, sponsors have to respond to the various required changes and adapt their protocol in view of diverging assessments by the DRAs. This situation requires additional time and effort by the pharmaceutical industry (without added value for the patients).",

Its contribution to the effectiveness and efficiency of the EU system, and therefore to the protection of public health and to the achievement of an operational internal market, is well recognized by all stakeholders. The effectiveness of the system has been maintained despite its growing complexity. Indeed, the increase in the number of centralized applications hhh and other procedures, EU enlargement, and new regulations have led to an increased workload and an enlarged scope of responsibility for the EMA over the past 10 years. These changes have led to the creation of new committees (COMP, PDCO, CAT, HMPC, PRAC) that require the implementation of additional procedures and new tools. These structural changes and increased responsibilities should be monitored closely in the future to avoid risks of inconsistencies, overlapping, bureaucracy, and rigidity. Also, it is critical to continue to monitor financial compensation of national DRAs and to regularly assess the involvement of each Member State in the EU pharmaceutical system to ensure availability of appropriate resources and expertise [150, 151] .",

The establishment of the International and European Cooperation Sector, formed in February 2012 and responsible for the development, coordination, and implementation of the Agency's international strategy and activities (including confidentiality arrangements with countries outside the EU), demonstrates the EMA commitment to international cooperation [155] . Also, collaboration has been initiated with China, India, and Russia on pharmaceuticals, and it is partnering with international organizations (i.e., ICH, WHO, and PIC/S). This work should continue and also be extended. It is indeed important to support the development of globally harmonized standards and requirements in order to ensure fair competition with other parts of the world for the development of medicines and to avoid delay in the availability of essential medicines for European patients. Ensuring against falsified medicines, resolution of pandemic issues, product development in emerging markets, and reliability of clinical data produced outside Europe are good examples where international cooperation is necessary to ensure adequate protection of public health in Europe.",

It would allow the necessary flexibility and different levels of review for interventional trials (e.g., a small national study with a well-known entity does not need the same type of evaluation, organization, and bureaucracy as a Phase 1 study with a new fusion protein or a large multinational Phase 3 study). Measures should be put in place to ensure that such reorganization would allow this flexibility and avoid any further increase of delay and administrative costs and burdens. For example, \"recognition\" of other assessments should be the focus, and \"nonrecognition\" should be limited to major issues (that should be clearly defined). These \"nonrecognitions\" of assessment by another country should be rare to avoid regular arbitration or appeals that would further delay the start of the clinical studies. Selection of Reference Member States (RMS) should also be defined because many parameters are involved in such selection (i.e., expertise, resources, balanced workload between countries, etc.). Finally, this new cooperative system should not result in the simple addition of national requirements, but a harmonized scientific assessment that would be implemented equally in all Member States. This next step in the harmonization of a clinical trial in Europe would certainly be beneficial for patients, sponsors of clinical trials (pharmaceutical companies, but also small entities or academic centers), and DRAs. Some of the above proposals have already been recommended by the European Commission [165] .

Finally, it will be important to see if and how the two new functions created by the Treaty of Lisbon (President of the EU Council and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy) will benefit the EU. The first important dossiers after the creation of these two functions (global financial crisis, global security, and support to Greece) have indeed still been handled by the political leaders of major Member States (i.e., France and Germany).",

Technical bodies need to be established to control medicines and manage the establishment of common procedures (especially centralized types). In Europe, it was key that the national DRAs provide expertise and resources to European bodies not only to ensure appropriate availability of resources, but also to ensure full adhesion of the countries into the system and adequate communication between all players of the system (national and European). \u25b8 When all the basic principles and a system are in place, additional more specific requirements can be discussed so that the system can take into account particular needs (i.e., specific requirements for specific products, population, etc.) in order to have a more coherent system. \u25b8 Finally, it very important to monitor the system and regularly review the extent to which this system and measures support the harmonization goals and meet the predefined objectives.

In 2010, the regulatory agency in Saudi Arabia, the SFDA, employed 150 people in its drug sector with approximately 50 reviewers, compared to less than 10 in most of the other GCC countries. The ongoing development of a common and central system needs to ensure that the less developed countries of the regions will benefit from this cooperation without impacting the more developed countries in this sector.

The initiative aims to improve the quality, safety, and efficacy of medicines circulating within the region, and to establish and maintain a regional shared network system for DRAs. The ICH and WHO guidelines, as well as other guidelines, form the basis as reference materials for the development of regional guidelines, with agreement on the adoption of international guidelines whenever possible. Potential topics for harmonization are identified at the level of the subcommittee of Ministers of Health, often with the input of senior ministerial health officials and MRA forum experts. The process of harmonization is initiated through the SADC Secretariat, which prepares and submits for decision an agenda to the Ministers of Health.",

This 2007-2013 plan identified priority areas, objectives, and major activities that needed to be implemented both at regional and national levels to improve access to quality and affordable essential medicines (including African traditional medicines). For example, strengthening regulatory capacity (and ensuring that fully functional DRAs are in place with an adequate enforcement infrastructure) and facilitation of the trade in pharmaceuticals within the regions were key strategies developed in the plan. The monitoring and ongoing evaluation of this plan (its implementation was estimated at US $16 million) was also described (see Figure 3 , which explains the relationship between the different players of the plan). Under the oversight of the Ministers of Health, a group of designated senior officials monitored the implementation of the plan via the establishment of technical subcommittees or task teams. This group of senior officials (from the health departments of each Member State) was also supported by the Secretariat. The sector of the Secretariat responsible for supporting the operations of the pharmaceutical harmonization initiative takes place under the directorate of the SHD&SP. National Health Ministries also play a significant role (by coordinating and leading the implementation of programs at the national level), and report on progress through their SADC National Committees. Finally, other stakeholders (e.g., professional associations, research institutions, DRAs, etc.) are also involved and requested to provide expertise and feedback on specific actions of the plan.",

However, the lack of appropriate regulations in some countries may paradoxically become an opportunity; the coordination of the development of the regulation (based on the WHO and ICH recommendations) can be viewed as an a priori harmonization. Moreover, it is interesting to note that the SADC structure presents a specificity not found in other harmonization initiatives. In addition to the standard centralized bodies (i.e., Summit, Council of Ministers, Committee of Senior Officials, Central Secretariat, etc.), the SADC has established National Committees.

The ASEAN Plus Three leaders expressed confidence in further strengthening and deepening East Asia cooperation at various levels and areas, particularly in economic, social, political, and other fields.

The ultimate steps in the pharmaceutical harmonization process will certainly be the development of ASEAN pharmaceutical directives, the development of a Pan-ASEAN registration process (with a centralized procedure), and the establishment of an ASEAN regulatory agency. But the full implementation of this supranational system will take time. It will only be possible when the ASEAN has developed common legislation and structure (i.e., commission, parliament, etc.), as in Europe. The harmonization of pharmaceutical regulations can, however, continue before such an organization is in place. The next logical step is the creation of an MRA procedure. Indeed, this type of procedure is not binding for the countries (and therefore does not require common legislation) and requests only a \"facilitator body\" and not a supranational evaluation agency. This procedure would be similar to the old \"multi-state\" procedure that Europe established in 1975 as a first step towards the creation of the system that we know today.",

This followed a proposal from South Korea in August 2008 (at the APEC LSIF VI in Lima, Peru) that was endorsed by the APEC leaders in November 2008 in a Joint Ministerial Statement. As an LSIF organization, this center has its own structure (including a Director, a Secretariat, and an Advisory Board of LSIF Experts), and also its own website (www.apec-ahc.org). This organization includes representatives from government, industry, and academia. Its mandate is to provide a platform to address and solve priority concerns of APEC members on regulatory convergence. Following the establishment of the AHC, several workshops took place. In general, they focused on the regional regulatory convergence, but also discussed specific problems such as multiregional clinical trials and the biosimilar concept. The purpose of these workshops is to allow government, regulators, academics, and the pharmaceutical companies to discuss and exchange information and views on the harmonization of standards. Funding and support from the AHC has allowed for the delivery of more than a dozen workshops since June 2009. \u25b8 In addition to the AHC, APEC also decided to establish a Regulatory Harmonization Steering Committee (RHSC) within the LSIF structure to strategically coordinate regulatory convergence in the region. The RHSC brought together senior officials from regulatory authorities and representatives from industry coalitions. This committee provides leadership and direction on regulatory priorities. During its inaugural meeting in Seoul, South Korea in June 2009, the RHSC discussed and finalized its Terms of Reference and started to identify priority projects. Since then, the RHSC has initiated several projects and developed a Strategic Framework on Regulatory Convergence of Medical Products by 2020 to coordinate activities [201] .",

In 2010, APEC conducted an assessment to determine what progress has been made against the Bogor Goals of free and open trade and investment. The results were positive, showing that member economies have taken concerted action and progressed in a wide array of economic, trade, investment, and social areas. Average tariffs in the region have been reduced from about 17% in 1989 to approximately 5.8% in 2010. Nontariff barriers have also been reduced thanks to APEC's work on trade facilitation. This progress by APEC towards the Bogor Goals contributed to a more than five-fold increase in members' total trade (goods and services) between 1989 and 2010 (from US $3.1 trillion to US $16.8 trillion). Finally, these activities contributed to real benefits for people across the entire Asia-Pacific region. Over the span of 10 years, from 1999 to 2009, poverty was reduced by 35% (poverty levels are measured by calculating the population living on less than US $2 a day) [206] .",

Indeed, this region is very heterogeneous with countries at the two extremes of the development spectrum (i.e., very developed and very undeveloped countries). Due to this disadvantage and the heterogeneity of this large region, it is difficult to adopt a treaty and to impose obligations on these members. For this reason, APEC operates on the basis of nonbinding commitments where each country has the choice to implement the decisions. The implementation of economic measures (i.e., reduction of taxes and trade barriers to increase trade between members) is possible since it can quickly benefit all members. However, the lack of a treaty or obligations on members can sometimes be more challenging for more drastic long-term reforms (i.e., the harmonization of standards), as member economies have different priorities. The diversity of the APEC region means that member economies will gradually move closer together in requirements and approaches, but not everyone will implement the measures at the same time.

For example, the US FDA has established several agreements with developing countries (e.g., Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Taiwan, etc.) \u25b8 Cooperation between Two Developing Countries: By pooling experience and resources, two countries can better tackle issues of common interest.

Moreover, confidentiality agreements have been established to create a framework allowing the exchange of confidential information between the EU and the US FDA as part of their regulatory and scientific processes. They include information on advanced drafts of legislation and regulatory guidance documents, as well as nonpublic information related to ensuring the quality, safety, and efficacy of medicinal products for human (and veterinary) use. An implementation plan has also been agreed upon between all parties to allow for a successful exchange of information and documents between the EU and the US FDA in accordance with the terms of the confidentiality agreements. The objective of this implementation plan was to describe the processes by which each party will undertake information and document exchange as envisioned by the confidentiality agreements. Also, to facilitate this transatlantic pharmaceutical cooperation, the US FDA and the EMA have established \"liaison officials.\" These liaison officials remain employed by their home organizations, but their physical location in the partner agency is designed to facilitate collaboration. Their role is to facilitate regulatory and scientific cooperation between the US FDA and the EMA, and to coordinate information exchange. They also increase awareness of interaction opportunities with the EMA and the US FDA, and potential new areas of common interest [219,220]. In 2003, the scope of this bilateral cooperation intensified with the establishment of confidentiality arrangements between the parties. These agreements signed on September 12, 2003 were then extended on September 15, 2005. In September 2010, these confidentiality agreements were extended again, and are now in effect for an indefinite period without the need for further renewal. These two 2010 official statements of authority and confidentiality commitment [223, 224] restate the agreement to pursue in-depth collaboration and exchange of confidential nonpublic information between the US FDA and the EMA. It is interesting to note that these statements reiterate that the shared information includes confidential commercial or trade secret information (the US FDA is required by current legislation to ask pharmaceutical companies before sharing trade secret information with counterpart DRAs).",

Additionally, new standards continue to be developed by different bodies (i.e., ICH vs. regional organizations) in parallel that not only duplicate efforts, but also create disharmony (e.g., biosimilars requirements had first been developed by individual countries and also by WHO). There is also a significant difference in the level of implementation of harmonized standards (i.e., the ICH recommendations/guidelines) between countries, and the CTD format has still not been implemented in all countries. It has also been reported that differences between developed and developing countries has in fact continued to increase in the past several years due to the increased complexity of technologies associated with the development of new therapies. Even between two close partners like the US and EU, which have developed a privileged partnership and strong cooperation, there are still important differences in standards.

Biotechnology Products and Biosimilars: One of the most recent and important LSIF topics of interest is the development of biotechnology products and biosimilars. A roadmap to promote convergence of regulatory pathways for biotechnology products is under discussion [203-1]. Moreover, the development of biosimilars can bring new hope for patients (on a global basis, but especially for poor countries) because they allow cheaper access to essential medicines. However, at the same time, their development can become a danger and a risk to public health if they are not well regulated. Regulatory discussions and actions on this topic have increased in the past several years (both in developed and developing countries) and have involved many organizations, including WHO. The second AHC workshop (hosted in Seoul, South Korea in September 2009) was focused on the topic of biosimilars in order to allow participants from different environments to exchange views and discuss the current status of biosimilar development.
