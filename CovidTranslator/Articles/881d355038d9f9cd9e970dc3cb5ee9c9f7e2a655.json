            "text": "Objective of this paper was to review relevant work and to present a general account of the bluetongue outbreak, which occurred in Greece in 2014. In total, 2895 outbreaks of the disease have been reported by the veterinary authorities of Greece; sheep, goats and cattle were affected with officially reported morbidity rates of 11.0%, 2.0% and 3.5%, respectively. No vaccinations were allowed and conservative measures were implemented to attempt to limit the disease, which at the end had expanded throughout the country. In field investigations, a significantly higher bluetongue morbidity rate (27.5%) in sheep has been reported. During that work, clinical anaemia was encountered, which was characterised as macrocytic, hypochromic, regenerative and non-haemolytic. Other investigations, which are reviewed in this paper, have described an outbreak of Citrobacter freundii-associated enteritis in newborn kids, offspring of goats subclinically infected with Bluetongue virus, increased rate of early embryonic deaths, reduced conception rates, increased incidence risk of mastitis and reduced milk yield in herds of subclinicallyinfected cattle and detection of the virus from hunter-harvested tissue samples of roe-deer. In 2015, vaccines against the disease have been licenced; vaccinations started in May 2015. Then, in 2015, only one outbreak of the disease was confirmed, which could have been the result of a combination of reasons acting concurrently to prevent further cases.",

Further comparisons showed that closest match within serotype 4 was with a strain isolated in Sudan in 1983 (94.2%-95.7% sequence similarity) . In segment 4 of the virus, there was a more close relation with two serotype 2 strains isolated in Tunisia or Italy, respectively (98.8% sequence similarity). Based on the evidence, it was suggested that the causal strain of the outbreak was a reassortant strain with genome segments from lineages of serotype 1, 2 and 4 . This would not be unusual in the Bluetongue virus family, where gene reasssortment occurs frequently (Roberts et al., 2014) . Vasileiou and Fthenakis (2014) were the first to report, during the outbreak, investigations performed in four closely monitored sheep flocks located in central Greece. Methodology and initial results of the investigation have been reported by Vasileiou and Fthenakis (2014) and are reviewed herein, with an update of the findings also presented in this paper. The first cases were diagnosed clinically in mid-August 2014. In all flocks, appropriate laboratory tests (competitive ELISA and/or RT-PCR) confirmed bluetongue caused by a serotype 4 strain of the virus. In these flocks with a total population of 560 sheep, 155 clinical cases were recorded, hence a morbidity rate of 27.5% (Table 3) , which was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than the overall morbidity rate reported throughout Greece (Table 1) .",

Although these were of no curative action against the causal agent, often they appeared to contribute to minimise the adverse effects of potential secondary infections. Other measures that were implemented to limit the disease in flocks with affected sheep were the extended housing of affected animals, the provision of high-energy, soft type feeds and the regular external application of insect repellents. In fact, occasionally, some animals recovered fully from the disease (Vasileiou and Fthenakis, 2014) . Vasileiou et al. (2015) have reported that during clinical examination of the animals in the flocks described above (4.1.) (Vasileiou and Fthenakis, 2014) , they also observed frequently severe pallor of the mucous membranes ('clinical anaemia') in the affected sheep. They performed detailed investigation of 75 such clinical cases in the four sheep flocks; methodology has been presented by Vasileiou et al. (2015) . During the examination of the mucous membranes of the eyes, they assigned one of the five scores available in the FAMACHA \u00a9 system eye colour chart (Vatta et al., 2001; Papadopoulos et al., 2013) , with scores ranging from '1' (='red, non-anaemic mucous membrane') to '5' (='white, severely anaemic mucous membrane'); in order to avoid inter-observer error, clinical examination of the animals and score assignment was always performed by the same investigator, a principal author in the current paper (NGCV). Modal score was '4' (='pink-white, anaemic mucous membrane') and 87% of animals examined were assigned a score indicating anaemia (Fig. 1 ). In no case, jaundice or haematuria were evident during clinical examinations. Finally, no ticks were evident during the examination on any sheep examined.",

Unfortunately however, this approach did not limit expansion of the disease to other regions of Greece, well beyond the area of the initial outbreak, as well as to neighbouring countries. Similar approaches were undertaken by other countries in the region (bar Turkey). Ultimately, the disease had spread widely and significantly, over 1500 km from the initial outbreak in southern Peloponnese to northern Romania and Hungary (World Organisation for Animal Health, 2014), favoured by the warm weather conditions, which supported flight activity of the vectors and the consequent transmission of the virus. One may possibly consider that the vaccinations performed in susceptible livestock in Turkey contributed to limiting the disease at the initial stages, soon after the first cases of the disease were diagnosed in that country.",

Therefore, one may suggest that under-reporting by farmers and field veterinarians has occurred. Possible reasons for this can be (i) fears of farmers for complications after reporting disease cases, e.g. reduced support payments, social reactions in small communities or legal requirements for disposal of dead animals, (ii) uncertainty from the part of those involved that declaration of cases to the authorities would lead to any improvement of the situation, (iii) under-staffing of the veterinary service or even (iv) fatigue of those involved consequently to the long duration of the outbreak.",

            "text": "During field work, clinical anaemia has been often recorded in affected animals, which was characterised as macrocytic, hypochromic, regenerative and non-haemolytic. Clinical anaemia had rarely been reported as associated with the disease. In the past, only Balaro et al. (2014) have reported this finding in cases of the disease caused by serotype 4 of the virus. In fact, Dercksen and Lewis (2007) have described that absence of anaemia can be used diagnostically for clinical differentiation of bluetongue from other diseases manifested with oedema in the head, e.g., H. contortus or F. hepatica infections. As this outbreak seems to have been caused by a novel, reassortant strain of the virus , the findings confirm the many clinical facets of the disorder, which may differ accordingly to the causative serotype or even strain of the virus. Presence of macrocytic erythrocytes with no other evidence of regenerative anaemia has been described in horses or cats (Thrall, 2004) . In the latter species, the findings have been associated with potential viral effect on bone marrow (Munoz, 2005) ; indeed, Bluetongue virus has been found to be able to destroy haemopoetic stem cells (Rodriguez-Calvo et al., 2014) . Findings in such cases would be compatible with the results of haematological tests . This would also explain absence of all other findings related to regenerative anaemia (e.g., polychromasia). Moreover, the virus causes endothelial injury (Maclachlan et al., 2009) : changes in affected vessels include endothelial hypertrophy with perivascular oedema and/or mild haemorrhages, which would further account for the reduced number of erythrocytes. Maclachlan et al. (2009) expressed the opinion that, possibly, Bluetongue virus may have similarities with viruses causing haemorrhagic diseases (e.g., Ebola virus) in causing endothelial damage and vascular injury and damage. Possibly, the extent of these lesions can be accentuated by release of host-mediated vasoactive molecules, as has been reported in other haemorrhagic viral diseases (Hoenen et al., 2006; Aleksandrowicz et al., 2008) . Chatzopoulos et al. (2015b) were first to report enteritis in newborn kids associated with C. freundii, although in the past, the disorder had been reported in calves (Ambrosim et al., 2002) and puppies (Galarneau et al., 2003) . In general, this organism is considered to be an opportunistic pathogen, which causes clinical disease under particular circumstances (e.g., in immunocompromised individuals). The organism exerts its pathogenic action after aggregative adherence onto the gastrointestinal mucosa, where it multiplies. In general, mechanisms of infection are similar to those of enteropathogenic strains of E. coli (Bai et al., 2012) ; production of Shiga-like and/or heat stable toxins by some strains has also been reported (Guarino et al., 1987) . C. freundii may also invade into the central nervous system, leading to development of neurological signs by affected individuals, but the relevant mechanisms are not fully understood, although it has been suggested that they were related to blood-brain barrier permeability and intracellular proliferation; the organism has a predilection for the meninges, which explains the characteristic neurological signs (Badger et al., 1999) . Immunosuppression associated with Bluetongue virus infection has been well documented (Maclachlan et al., 2009; Umeshappa et al., 2010) and may lead to increased incidence of secondary bacterial infections in affected animals. The extended viraemia, the replication of the virus in lymphoid cells and the endothelial damage and vascular injury caused by the virus lead to malfunctions of hematopoietic organs, including bone marrow and spleen. This might have contributed to the severity of disease observed in kids infected with C. freundii, as possibly infected and immunocompromised dams might have not provided to their kids qualitatively adequate colostrum, which led to reduced protection against an opportunistic pathogen.",

Wild deer, especially red deer, which is most relevant to Bluetongue virus infections, presents several features, due to which, they might be appropriate host of the virus (Chapman et al., 1993; Grego et al., 2014) . Red deer live in populations with increased density and often at the same altitude with livestock. They are animals larger than sheep or goats, with life habits and feeding habitats similar to domesticated small ruminants, hence exposed to bites of insects (Acevedo et al., 2008; Apollonio et al., 2010) . Therefore, they can be infected to a similar extent as domestic ruminants, which indicates that systematic surveillance can be significant for monitoring and prediction of possible re-emergence. These findings also point out to a requirement to change surveillance of the disease. In fact, bluetongue has been confirmed in wild cervids prior to diagnosing it in domestic ruminant species (Garcia et al., 2009; Lorca-Oro et al., 2011) , a finding that may be used as an early marker of an upcoming outbreak. In endemic regions, seropositivity rates in wild cervids were similar to those in domestic ruminants (Ruiz-Fons et al., 2014) .",

There may be a combination of reasons for this: (i) increased antibody titres in animals infected during 2014, which might have provided protection, (ii) immunoprotection of susceptible animals, which had been vaccinated subsequently to licencing appropriate immunological products, and (iii) reduced numbers of infected vectors, as the result of widespread spraying of insecticides in the spring and early summer of the year. Nevertheless, there is a need to set up effective surveillance for the disease. It is noteworthy that in 2015, in France, new cases of bluetongue caused by serotype 8 of the virus have been diagnosed (World Organisation for Animal Health, 2015), only some years after the country had been declared free from the previous incursion of the disease.",

Features of the disease have been described and the current paper reviews and combines the previous work, providing an overall account of the outbreak of the disease in Greece. Presence of clinical anaemia, which had rarely been associated with the disease in the past, is noteworthy. The disease had further repercussions, including disorders caused by unusual pathogens and adverse effects in production of subclinically infected animals. In the spring of 2015, vaccines have been licenced. Very few new cases of the disease have been officially reported to the international authorities in 2015.",
