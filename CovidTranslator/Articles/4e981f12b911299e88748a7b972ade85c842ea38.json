However, attempts to express the RNA virus genes using the same strategy were not successful. In an effort to optimize the expression, we have constructed several BAV-3 recombinants carrying the hemagglutinin esterase (HE) gene of bovine coronavirus (BCV) in the E3 region with or without exogenous transcription control elements. The expression studies suggest that the introduction of a 137 bp chimeric intron upstream of the HE cDNA is able to increase the level of HE gene expression. The introduction of a SV40 early promoter or human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) immediate early (IE) promoter into the expression cassette changed the kinetics of the HE expression. However, the recombinant BAV-3 containing HE under the HCMV IE promoter replicated less efficiently than the wild-type BAV-3. These studies should prove useful in expression of other RNA viral genes in the E3 region of BAV-3 expression system.",

The S and HE proteins are major membrane associated glycoproteins and induce virus neutralizing antibodies . The monoclonal antibodies raised against the HE protein neutralize the infectivity of BCV under cell culture conditions and protected the intestinal epithelia of cattle from the virus infection (Deregt and Babiuk, 1987) . In addition, the immunogenicity of a recombinant human adenovirus-5 (HAV-5) expressing the HE gene was tested in cotton rats (Baca-Estrada et al., 1995) . Although HAV-5 based vectors (expressing vaccine antigens from different bovine pathogens) have been used to test the efficacy and immunogenicity of protective antigens in experimental animals (Baca-Estrada et al., 1995; Breker-Klassen et al., 1995; Papp et al., 1997) , their use as recombinant vaccines in cattle is limited due to their broad host range, which creates regulatory concerns.",

            "text": "In recent years, the idea of using bovine adenovirus-3 (BAV-3) as a vector (Baxi et al., 1999; Reddy et al., 1999; Zakhartchouk et al., 1998) for delivery of protective antigen from pathogens of cattle has received considerable attention. Deletion of the non-essential E3 region has facilitated construction of replication-competent BAV-3 vectors expressing authentic and truncated forms of glycoprotein D (gD) of bovine herpes virus-1 . During infection of bovine cell lines, such recombinant BAVs produced large amounts of glycoprotein gD (a DNA virus gene), which has been shown to undergo proper post-translational modifications . In addition, intranasal inoculation of calves with these recombinants has been shown to be safe and efficacious, making these vectors particularly attractive for vaccination of cattle (Zakhartchouk et al., 1999) . However, similar attempts to obtain high levels of expression of HE gene of bovine corona virus in a replication-competent BAV-3 vector without any flanking upstream or downstream sequences have been unsuccessful. Since the level of expression of an antigen may determine the quality of immune response in animals immunized orally or intranasally with recombinant adenoviruses, it is necessary to maximize the expression of a vaccine antigen. In addition, as the development of a quality immune response would correlate with levels of antigen produced by the recombinant adenovirus vectors, we investigated ways of increasing HE gene expression in the BAV-3 expression system. The main reason to choose BCV HE gene was that it has been difficult to over express HE using a variety of heterologous expression systems (unpublished data). In addition, BCV causes neonatal diarrhea in calves resulting in significant economic losses due to mortality and decreased productivity of the survivors. Since currently available vaccines against BCV are not effective (Waltner-Toews et al., 1995) , better vaccines are needed to reduce the economic losses.",

The 1.3 kb blunt end repaired BamHI fragment containing the HE gene (Parker et al., 1989) was ligated, to blunt end repaired SalI digested plasmid pSVPIA to create plasmid pSVPIA.HE, and to blunt end repaired SalI digested plasmid pCMVIA to create plasmid pCMVIA.HE. A 1.9 kb fragment of plasmid pSVPIA.HE and a 2.0 kb fragment of plasmid pCMVPIA.HE containing the HE gene under appropriate transcriptional elements were isolated and ligated individually to blunt end repaired SrfI digested plasmid pBAV301 to create plasmids pBAV301.HEsv and pBAV301.HEcmv respectively. Finally, the recombinant BAV-3 genomes were isolated by homologous recombination in E. coli BJ5183 between SrfI linearized plasmid pF-BAV302 and the 7.8 kb KpnI -SpeI fragment of pBAV301.Hesv creating plasmid pFBAV333, and between SrfI linearized plasmid pFBAV302 and the 8.1 kb KpnI -SpeI fragment of pBAV301.HEcmv creating plasmid pFBAV334.",

The full length HE gene alone or with different exogenous transcriptional elements was inserted individually into the E3 region of plasmid pFBAV302 in the same transcriptional orientation of E3 using homologous recombination in E. coli (Chariter et al., 1996) . The Pac-I digested pFBAV303, pF-BAV332, pFBAV333 or pFBAV334 plasmid DNA was transfected into VIDO R2 cells (transformed fetal bovine retina cells). The infected monolayers showing 50% cytopathic effects were collected, freeze thawed and recombinant viruses were plaque purified and propagated in MDBK cells. The recombinant viruses were named BAV303 (HE without exogenous elements), BAV332 (HE with chimeric intron), BAV333 (HE with SV40 promoter, chimeric intron and SV40 polyA) and BAV334 (HE with CMV promoter, chimeric intron, SV40 polyA) (Fig. 1) . The viral DNA was extracted from infected cells by the Hirt method (Hirt, 1967) and analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis after digestion with BamHI restriction enzyme. The digestion of wild type BAV-3 viral DNA with BamHI yields five fragments and the fragment D (3.019 kb) contains the E3 region ( Fig. 2A, lane 1) .

This was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of BamHI digested genomic DNA of wild type and recombinant BAV3s. As seen in the Fig.  2B , the same modified BamHI 'D' fragment (s) from the recombinant viruses hybridized to h-32 P dCTP labeled HE gene in the Southern blot hybridization (Fig. 2B, lanes 3,4,5,6 ).

Recently, we have developed a replication-competent BAV-3 vector with a 1.245 kb deletion in the E3 region, removing all E3 open reading frames, leaving the E3 promoter, 5% intiation site, and the poly(A) site intact . Recombinant BAV-3 expressed high levels of full length or truncated forms of glycoprotein D (gD) of BHV-1 when the genes coding for these proteins were introduced into the E3 region in the same orientation as the E3 transcription unit without any exogenous transcription control elements . However, when the cD-NAs representing the protective antigen from RNA viruses including BCV were inserted into the E3 region of BAV-3, no expression of the proteins was obtained (unpublished observation).",

If a RNA virus gene is to be expressed through a recombinant adenoviral vector system, its mRNA must be free of any cryptic splice sites or else the message could be broken into pieces by the splicing machinery present in the cell nucleus. This can be prevented either by swapping codons to remove internal splice sites (expensive) or by inserting an intron upstream of the cDNA. Since transfection studies have demonstrated that an intron flanking the cDNA insert frequently increases the level of cDNA expression (Huang and Gorman, 1990) , it was hypothesized that introduction of an intron upstream of a cDNA could prevent utilization of possible cryptic 5%-donor splice sites within the cDNA sequence (Huang and Gorman, 1990) . Addition of poly(A) + [e.g. SV40 late poly(A) signal] has also been shown to enhance RNA stability and translation (Carswell and Alwine, 1989; Jackson and Standart, 1990 ). However, the size of the poly(A) and the intron should be minimal as its inclusion will reduce the ultimate capacity of the adenovirus vector. The intron A, which is most widely used to express cDNAs is about 800 bp in length and will reduce the size limit of foreign DNA that can be put into BAV-3 vectors.",

Addition of a chimeric intron and SV40 poly(A) + signal dramatically increased the levels of HE gene expression. From the size of majority of mRNAs, it appears that the HE transcripts must have initiated from the major late promoter (MLP). It seems likely that the chimeric intron provided the strong splice acceptor site. Consis-tent with this speculation is the fact that synthesis of HE was observed late (36 h) after infection, when much of the transcription occurs from MLP.",

It seems likely that early HE transcripts must have been initiated from the BAV-3 E3 promoter or SV40/HCMV promoter. Support for this hypothesis comes from the fact that (a) HE specific mRNAs of smaller size are abundant in BAV333 and BAV334 infected cells; (b) BAV-3 E3 284R protein expressed from the E3 promoter can be detected at 24 h but not at 12 h post infection .

Expression of the HE was seen as early as 6 h postinfection and produced throughout the infection. However, BAV-3 differs from HAV-5 with respect to replication kinetics. In BAV-3 infected cells, viral DNA replication begins at about 24 h postinfection and reaches a peak after 40 h, whereas viral DNA replication in HAV-5 infected cells occurs as early as 12 h postinfection (Niiyama et al., 1975) . The green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression was noticed at 12 h postinfection when the gene for GFP was placed under the control of CMV immediate early promoter in the E3 region of BAV-3 . This suggests that kinetics of foreign gene expression from the E3 region of BAV-3 may be influenced not only by exogenous transcriptional elements but also by the nature of the foreign gene.",
