The optimum diagnostic procedure is examination of thick and thin blood films by an expert to detect and speciate the malarial parasites.

Most patients treated for P. falciparum malaria should be admitted to hospital for at least 24 h as patients can deteriorate suddenly, especially early in the course of treatment. In specialised units seeing large numbers of patients, outpatient treatment may be considered if specific protocols for patient selection and follow up are in place. 10 . Uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria should be treated with an artemisinin combination therapy (Grade 1A). Artemetherelumefantrine (Riamet \u00d2 ) is the drug of choice (Grade 2C) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (Eurartesim \u00d2 ) is an alternative. Quinine or atovaquone eproguanil (Malarone \u00d2 ) can be used if an ACT is not available. Quinine is highly effective but poorly-tolerated in prolonged treatment and should be used in combination with an additional drug, usually oral doxycycline. 11 . Severe falciparum malaria, or infections complicated by a relatively high parasite count (more than 2% of red blood cells parasitized) should be treated with intravenous therapy until the patient is well enough to continue with oral treatment. Severe malaria is a rare complication of P. vivax or P. knowlesi infection and also requires parenteral therapy.",

Haemolysis occurs in approximately 10e15% patients following intravenous artesunate treatment. Haemoglobin concentrations should be checked approximately 14 days following treatment in those treated with IV artemisinins (Grade 2C). 16 . Falciparum malaria in pregnancy is more likely to be complicated: the placenta contains high levels of parasites, stillbirth or early delivery may occur and diagnosis can be difficult if parasites are concentrated in the placenta and scanty in the blood. 17 . Uncomplicated falciparum malaria in the second and third trimester of pregnancy should be treated with artemetherelumefantrine (Grade 2B). Uncomplicated falciparum malaria in the first trimester of pregnancy should usually be treated with quinine and clindamycin but specialist advice should be sought. Severe malaria in any trimester of pregnancy should be treated as for any other patient with artesunate preferred over quinine (Grade 1C). 18 . Children with uncomplicated malaria should be treated with an ACT (artemether elumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine) as first line treatment (Grade 1A). Quinine with doxycycline or clindamycin, or atovaquoneeproguanil at appropriate doses for weight can also be used. Doxycycline should not be given to children under 12 years. 19 . Either an oral ACT or chloroquine can be used for the treatment of non-falciparum malaria. An oral ACT is preferred for a mixed infection, if there is uncertainty about the infecting species, or for P. vivax infection from areas where chloroquine resistance is common (Grade 1B). 20. Dormant parasites (hypnozoites) persist in the liver after treatment of P. vivax or P. ovale infection: the only currently effective drug for eradication of hypnozoites is primaquine (1A). Primaquine is more effective at preventing relapse if taken at the same time as chloroquine (Grade 1C). 21 . Primaquine should be avoided or given with caution under expert supervision in patients with Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), in whom it may cause severe haemolysis. 22 . Primaquine (for eradication of P. vivax or P. ovale hypnozoites) is contraindicated in pregnancy and when breastfeeding (until the G6PD status of child is known); after initial treatment for these infections a pregnant woman should take weekly chloroquine prophylaxis until after delivery or cessation of breastfeeding when hypnozoite eradication can be considered.",

Between 1300 and 1800 malaria cases are reported each year in the UK, although reviews of reporting suggest that this may represent about 65% of all cases that occur. 1 Approximately three-quarters of reported infections are due to Plasmodium falciparum and there are between 2 and 11 deaths annually. Children under 16 account for around 10% of cases. 2 Two thirds of cases occur in people of African or South Asian ethnic origin and over half of the cases occur in those who had been visiting friends and family in endemic areas. 3 Most patients with falciparum malaria acquire infection in Africa and malaria accounts for about 20% of travellers from Africa presenting to hospital with fever; West Africa is the commonest geographical source. Most Plasmodium vivax infections are acquired in South Asia. 2, 4 This document offers guidance for the management of both uncomplicated and complicated malaria in the UK. It complements existing Public Health England (PHE) guidelines on the prevention of malaria in UK travellers. https:// www.gov.uk/government/publications/malariaprevention-guidelines-for-travellers-from-the-uk. It has been based on a review of the available evidence by the PHE Advisory Committee on Malaria Prevention (ACMP), with input from other experts and expert bodies, and incorporates international guidance including WHO guidelines on treatment and definitions of severe malaria. 5,6 These guidelines will specifically present a UK perspective on management. Other non-endemic countries including the USA, Canada and Europe have also developed their own guidelines. 7e9 These UK guidelines have been developed specifically for use in a non-endemic setting, but necessarily depend heavily upon evidence obtained from studies in endemic areas. More detailed information about individual drug regimens and contra-indications can be found in the British National Formulary (http://www.bnf.org/). A short summary of key points in the initial assessment and management, for use in emergency departments, is available from the British Infection Association website (http://www.britishinfection.org/).",

Malaria should be suspected in anyone with a fever or a history of fever who has returned from or previously visited a malaria endemic area, regardless of whether they have taken prophylaxis.

Most patients with falciparum infection present in the first month or months after exposure; almost all present within six months of exposure. Vivax or ovale infections commonly present later than six months after exposure and presentation may be delayed for years. There are no specific symptoms of malaria: most patients complain of fever, headache and general malaise. 10 Gastrointestinal disturbances, jaundice or respiratory symptoms occasionally occur and are often responsible for misdiagnosis. Most missed malaria infections are erroneously diagnosed as non-specific viral infections, influenza, gastroenteritis or hepatitis. Children are less likely than adults to complain of chills, arthralgia/myalgia or headaches and more likely to present with non-specific symptoms (fever, lethargy, malaise, somnolence): gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea) are particularly common. 11, 12 The physical examination of patients with uncomplicated malaria is often unremarkable apart from a fever which is not invariably present. Most patients have no specific fever pattern. Children are more likely to have hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and somnolence than adults. 11, 12 If the diagnosis of falciparum malaria has been delayed, severely ill patients may present with jaundice, confusion or seizures.",

However, because of a lack of expertise in many UK labs, particularly out of hours, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) based upon detection of parasite antigens, are now commonly used in addition to blood slides.

Children with falciparum malaria should be observed in hospital initially for at least 24 h, because of the possibility of rapid progression and also to ensure that they are tolerating oral therapies; treatment in children may be complicated by vomiting. 32, 33 Patients should be observed closely; certain categories such as pregnant women, infants and the elderly are more likely to develop severe disease or to deteriorate rapidly. 29, 34, 35 The management of patients with falciparum malaria, especially if severe, should always be discussed with a specialist; mortality is higher in regions of the UK where malaria is less commonly managed. 29 26% of UK malaria cases are seen in centres with less than 10 cases a year. 36 Patients with falciparum malaria (or a mixed infection which includes falciparum parasites) can be divided into those with uncomplicated and those with severe or complicated disease (Box 3).

DHA-PPQ should not currently be used in patients with previous arrhythmias, cardiac conditions that predispose to arrhythmia, or those taking drugs that prolong the QT interval. ECGs should be obtained early in the course of treatment with DHA-PPQ and before and after the last daily dose of DHA-PPQ; more frequent monitoring may be indicated in those taking drugs which inhibit CYP3A4 and potentially increase piperaquine levels, such as clarithromycin.",

Quinine is often associated with \"cinchonism\" (nausea, deafness and ringing in the ears), which may result in poor adherence. Although international recommendations suggest that quinine should be taken for seven days in endemic areas, 5 UK experience suggests that five days treatment is adequate for the vast majority of cases when combined with a second drug (doxycycline for adults or clindamycin in pregnant women and young children) to ensure complete eradication of parasites. The second drug can be taken either simultaneously with quinine or sequentially after the quinine. In view of increasing failure rates of anti-folate drugs in most part of the world, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (Fansidar \u00d2 ) should not be used routinely as a second drug to accompany quinine, except on specialist advice. Chloroquine should NOT be used for the treatment of falciparum malaria. Antibiotics, including tetracyclines, sulfa drugs, macrolides and clindamycin, should only be used in combination therapies and not used alone for the treatment of malaria. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of azithromycin either alone or in combination with other drugs for the treatment of malaria. 50 Treatment of severe or complicated falciparum malaria Antimalarial therapy Urgent appropriate parenteral therapy with antimalarials has the greatest impact on prognosis in severe malaria. Treatment should not be delayed in patients with proven or strongly suspected malaria. Parenteral treatment is indicated in all patients with severe or complicated malaria, those at high risk of developing severe disease (Box 5) or if the patient is vomiting and unable to take oral antimalarials.",

The RCOG has produced specific guidelines for the treatment of malaria in pregnancy. 79 Uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Neither artemetherelumefantrine (Riamet \u00d2 ), atovaquoneeproguanil (Malarone \u00d2 ) or DHA-PPQ are licenced in pregnancy. There is no evidence of adverse effects of artemetherelumefantrine in the second and third trimester from a limited number of studies. 80 Data on safety in the first trimester are even more limited but no evidence of harm has been detected. Small studies on atovaquoneeproguanil have shown no evidence of adverse effects. Artemetherelumefantrine is considered the treatment of choice in the second and third trimester (Grade 2B) (information on DHA-PPQ is currently more limited). Quinine (seven days) in combination with clindamycin (see dose above) can be used in all Box 7. Intensive care management of severe or complicated malaria.",

Judicious and slow volume resuscitation is important in those children presenting with shock; the FEAST trial showed a detrimental effect of routine fluid bolus administration. 83 Hypoglycemia is a common complication of severe malaria; serial blood glucose estimations must be performed, and hypoglycemia corrected using 5e10% glucose in maintenance fluid. 68 As it is often difficult to exclude or differentiate concurrent bacterial septic shock or meningitis from severe malaria, empirical broad spectrum antibiotics should be given to children with severe malaria until bacterial infection can be excluded 84 (Grade 1B). Management of seizures should follow the evidence-based guidelines advocated by the Advanced Paediatric Life Support Group. 85 Blood transfusions may be required for severe anaemia, although a Cochrane review found that routine transfusion did not reduce mortality, but caused more adverse events. 86 Clear evidence from a large randomised trial now shows that although quinine remains effective, artesunate is associated with a survival advantage (relative risk reduction of 22.5%) and a significant reduction in clinical complications (development of coma, convulsions and deterioration of coma score). 52 In line with the WHO guidelines, we recommend that IV artesunate should be used preferentially over quinine as the drug of choice for treatment of severe falciparum malaria in children (grade 1A). Recent WHO guidelines suggest that a higher dose is required for children under 20 kg. 5 Intravenous quinine is still indicated if artesunate is not immediately available and treatment should not be delayed whilst awaiting artesunate therapy.",

Although there are no systematic studies on the value of early follow-up of patients following treatment for imported malaria, the Committee believes that it is good practice to repeat a blood film and full blood count approximately fourteen days after treatment, particularly if patients have had severe malaria or received artemisinin therapy. It also provides a further opportunity to reinforce the need for appropriate antimalarial precautions to be taken by the patient and his or her relatives next time they travel (https://www.gov.uk/government/ publications/malaria-prevention-guidelines-for-travellersfrom-the-uk).",

Warn patients about possible recrudescence or relapse of malaria following treatment and to report recurrence of fever to their general practitioner. Warn patients treated with artesunate about possible haemolysis and the importance of attending for follow-up blood tests. At follow up, review results of any tests needed or performed for other travel related infections including HIV infection. Discuss period of exclusion from blood donation after malaria e blood donors need to inform and discuss own situation with National Blood Service.
