            "text": "Chickens from two inbred lines selected for high (L10H) or low (L10L) mannose-binding lectin (MBL) serum concentrations were infected with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and innate as well as adaptive immunological parameters were measured throughout the experimental period. Chickens with high MBL serum concentrations were found to have less viral load in the trachea than chickens with low MBL serum concentrations indicating that these chickens were less severely affected by the infection. This study is the first to show that MBL expression is present in the lungs of healthy chickens and that the expression is upregulated at days 3 postinfection (p.i.) in L10H chickens. Furthermore, in the liver of infected chickens, the MBL expression was upregulated at day 7 p.i., despite the fact that the MBL serum concentrations were decreased below baseline at that time point. The number of TCRcd + CD8a + cells in the blood of noninfected chickens increased from week 0 to 3 p.i. However, the number of cells was higher in L10H chickens than in L10L chickens throughout the experiment. No increase was observed in the number of TCRcd + CD8a + cells in the blood of the infected L10H and L10L chickens. The numbers of B cells at week 3 p.i. were higher for noninfected L10L chickens than for the other chickens. No differences were observed between the infected and noninfected L10H chickens or between the infected L10H and L10L chickens. Furthermore, at week 3 p.i., the number of monocytes was higher in infected and noninfected L10H chickens than in the infected and noninfected L10L chickens. Thus, these results indicate that MBL is produced locally and may be involved in the regulation of the cellular immune response after an IBV infection. However, MBL did not appear to influence the humoral immune response after IBV infection in this study.",

IBV causes infections that result in clinical signs, such as gasping, coughing, tracheal rales, depression, and nasal and ocular discharge. The extent of morbidity and mortality depends on the virus strain, already established immunosuppression, breed and age of the chicks, nutrition, and environment (12, 26, 51) . Although IBV causes an upper respiratory tract disease, it also replicates in many nonrespiratory organs, such as the kidneys and the reproductive organ. This may cause nephritis and poor egg production/quality (11, 16) . Different genetic strains of IBV exist, where some strains remain within a defined geographic region while others are distributed worldwide (16, 30) . Furthermore, different strains can cocirculate within a region (9) . The virus spreads between flocks and chicks by air or by fecal shedding (12, 19) .",

Because of this and the highly infectious nature of IBV, the ideal management in the poultry industry requires strict quarantine measures, but attempts to keep flocks IBV-clear have not been successful. This has necessitated the use of vaccines to reduce the production losses. Live-attenuated vaccines have been used as far back as in the 1940s, and today, both live-attenuated and inactivated virus vaccines are used (12, 16, 26) . Some of the vaccines may offer crossprotection between different IBV strains, but this is not true for all vaccines (10, 39) . However, combined administration of different attenuated IBV strains may improve crossprotection (58) .",

            "text": "During a primary infection, innate immune responses are induced in the mucosal lining of trachea as the binding of IBV virions to receptors on epithelia cells initiates the infection. Recent studies suggest that the binding is sialic acid dependent and that chicken homologues of the human receptors, DC-SIGN or L-SIGN, are part of an IBV receptor complex (1, 59, 61) . Receptors such as the toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, TLR7, and TLR2/6 may initiate the local trachea innate immune response upon IBV recognition (21, 57) . Since mannosebinding lectin (MBL) binds to IBV (36) , early events in the immune response to IBV infection may involve MBL by opsonization of free virions, by complement activation at mucosal sites, or by inhibition of the virus entry through sialic acid-dependent receptors (21, 31, 32, 47, 63) . In mammals, the complement system has been suggested to be important in T-cell activation together with the production of types I and II interferons (IFNs) and other mediators, which trigger the antiviral state of neighboring cells and the influx of T cells to the local tissue (35) . Hence, IBV infection induces broad immune responses in chickens, but the extent of the immune response varies depending on the IBV strain, the infection route, and the infected tissues. Furthermore, although all chicks are susceptible to IBV, both field and experimental studies show that the outcome of the infection differs between genetically different lines (4, 33, 46) . Several studies have shown that major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotypes influence the susceptibility to IBV infection (3, 4, 7, 15) .",

            "text": "Selective breeding of chickens for low or high MBL serum concentrations has been practiced for numerous generations at our department as published by Juul-Madsen et al. (32) . This has resulted in two separate chicken lines designated high (L10H) or low (L10L) with mean MBL serum concentrations of 33.4 lg/mL serum (L10H) and 7.6 lg/mL serum (L10L) in the 14th generation (unpublished data). The average MBL serum concentration for 14 different chicken strains representing both broilers and layers is approximately 6 lg/mL and varies from 0.4 to 37.8 lg/mL in 308 apparently normal chickens (38) . Studies using the L10 chicken sublines as well as the outbred chickens have shown an inverse relationship between the MBL serum concentrations and the pathogenspecific Ig antibody response (32, 52) . Also, studies in mice have shown that MBL deficiency may result in a higher pathogen-specific IgG antibody response after both fungal infection (45) and bacterial vaccination (22) . The adaptive immune system relies on inflammatory signaling, and MBL has been suggested to play a role in the regulation of this signaling by upregulating tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin (IL)-6 responses, and other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-1a, IL-b, and IFN-c in mice (29, 40, 55) . The elucidation of the role of MBL in the development of adaptive immunity during an IBV infection may lead to a better understanding of how MBL may influence the outcome of infection. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the cellular and humoral immune response after IBV infection in the two chicken lines, L10H and L10L, varying in MBL serum concentrations. Innate as well as adaptive immunological parameters were measured throughout the experimental period.",

The offspring was reared together in a biosecured IBV-free environment until they were 3 weeks of age and then allocated into two different groups with 24 birds from each line in each group. The chickens were transferred to biosafety level 2 facilities and randomly allocated into four groups and placed into four isolators.

All IBV inocula were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) just before use and contained at least 10 5.2 EID 50 /100 lL of IBV-M41 virus. The first and second groups (the noninfected groups) were treated with 200 lL PBS per bird as a mock challenge. The third and fourth groups (the infected groups) were treated with 200 lL PBS per bird containing IBV-M41. The solutions were given half nasally and half orally to mimic the natural occurring inoculation routes of IBV in the chicken. The chickens were fed diets that met or exceeded the National Research Council requirements. Feed and water were provided ad libitum.",

The KASP genotyping technology is based on fluorescently labeled allelespecific PCR primers. Primers for both SNP markers were designed based on flanking regions in the chicken genomic MBL promoter sequences (Table 1) . A total of 5 lL reaction volume containing 25 ng of DNA was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and applied to 384-well PCR plates. The following PCR cycling conditions were used: 94\u00b0C for 15 min (hot-start activation) followed by 10 cycles of touchdown PCR denaturing at 94\u00b0C for 20 sec and annealing/elongation at 65-57\u00b0C for 1 min dropping 0.8\u00b0C per cycle.

Real-time RT-PCR was performed on total RNA titration for the assessment of the optimal total RNA concentration. Based on this, the concentration of total RNA was adjusted to 10 ng/lL to ensure that differences in endogenous control genes and MBL gene expression were not because of variability in RNA concentrations. The total RNA was reverse transcribed using the High-Capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems by Life Technologies; cat. no. 436881) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting cDNA was used as template for real-time RT-PCR. Assessment of the variability between tissues and between noninfected and infected chickens of endogenous control genes (Supplementary Table S1 for names of genes and their TaqMan Gene Expression Assay ID; Supplementary Data are available online at www .liebertpub.com/vim) was performed. Among the six measured endogenous control genes (TBP/GAPDH/HRPT1/ YWHAE/RPL4/GUSB), GAPDH was chosen for normalization across different tissues and treatment groups based on the fact that this gene showed the most relatively constant expression. GAPDH and MBL (TaqMan Gene Expression Assay ID: Gg03364872_m1, dye: FAM_MGB) are expressed in the liver, while the PCR efficiencies were found in this tissue to be 99.5% (GAPDH) and 96% (MBL).The real-time RT-PCR was performed, with TaqMan Gene Expression Assay, 5 ng of cDNA from 12 noninfected and 12 infected chickens sampled on days 3 and 7 p.i. using the TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR Master mix reagents kit (Applied Biosystems by Life Technologies; cat. no. 4309169) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amplification was performed using the ViiA\u00d4 7 system (Applied Biosystems by Life Technologies) with the following cycling conditions: 1 cycle of 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 sec, and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. GAPDH mRNA was used as an endogenous control to normalize the quantities of target mRNAs and presented as the change in induction relative to that of untreated control cells. Calculations of expression were normalized by using the DCt method, where the amount of target, normalized to an endogenous control and relative to a calibrator (lung from noninfected L10L chickens day 3 p.i.), is given by 2 -DDCt , where Ct is the cycle number of the detection threshold. Each real-time RT-PCR experiment contained notemplate controls and test samples.",

At day 3 p.i., a tendency for an increase of the MBL expression was observed in the lungs of infected L10H chickens. MBL mRNA expression has previously been detected in the trachealarynx, abdominal air sac, infundibulum, and thymus of healthy chickens (25) but not in the lungs of healthy chicks as the current study shows. This inconsistence may be a result of different sampling location within the lung. A low expression of the pig MBL1 has also been detected in the lungs of healthy pigs (50) . Furthermore, MBL expression has been observed in mouse macrophages during atherosclerosis (41) and in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 after LPS stimulation (54) . Thus, the increased MBL expression observed in the lungs in the current study may be caused by an increased MBL expression in the macrophages in the lungs since no separation of cells in the lung tissues was made before RNA extraction in the current study. The highest MBL expression in the present study was observed in the lungs of infected chickens at day 3 p.i., which is consistent with the viral load being highest at day 3 p.i. However, the climaxing of viral load in the trachea and lung may not necessary be the same at the same time point since Asasi et al. (2) found that the amount of viral genomes in the lungs of IBV-infected chickens was higher at day 7 p.i. compared to day 3 p.i. The tendency of increased MBL expression during infection in the lungs found in the current study suggests that MBL may play a role locally after an IBV infection.",

However, a significant increase in the MBL fold change was observed for infected chickens at day 7 p.i. for both sublines ( p < 0.01). This is inconsistent with the low MBL serum concentration observed at day 7 p.i. and questions the suggestion by Juul-Madsen et al.

Phenotyping of four circulation T-cell populations, TCRcd + CD8a + and TCRcd + CD8acells as well as TCRcd -CD4 -CD8a + and total TCRcd -CD4 + cells, were performed during the present experiment (Fig. 6) . The function of chicken cd T cells is still not identified in detail, but studies have indicated that cd T cells respond to pathogens and provide a protective immune response after immunization with both live-attenuated and nonattenuated Salmonella strains (5) . Besides, cd T cells may contribute with up to 60% of the circulating T cells in a healthy adult chickens (17) supporting the hypothesis that they play an important role in the chicken immune system. In the current study, the numbers of TCRcd + CD8acells differed between L10H and L10L and both infected L10H and L10L chickens had lower number of TCRcd + CD8acells than the corresponding noninfected chicken line. Thus, the infection resulted in the same kinetics in L10H and L10L. The infected resulted in the same kinetics for the TCRcd + CD8a + cells in L10H and L10L chickens, but overall, L10L chickens had significantly lower numbers of TCRcd + CD8a + cells than L10H chickens. Hence, there was no line effect but only an effect of the infection. The absence of an increased number of TCRcd + CD8a + cells in the blood may indicate that the cells have migrated from the blood to the infected tissues or to the germinal centers to support the B cells in mounting a germinal center response, as seen for mice lacking ab T cells (62) . Hence, further studies should include the examination of the presence of T-cell subsets in infected tissues to verify this argument.",

Following an IBV infection, the MBL serum concentrations increase and subsequently decrease to below basic level. This decrease is not caused be a negative regulation at the MBL transcription level since an upregulation of the MBL expression was observed in the liver in infected L10H and L10L chickens at day 7 p.i. Furthermore, this study shows that the MBL expression is present in the lungs of healthy chickens and that the expression is upregulated after an IBV infection. The MBL serum level has no influence on the IBV-specific Ig titer after IBV infection despite the difference in the amount of B cells between L10H and L10L chickens. The number of TCRcd + CD8a + cells differed between both noninfected and infected L10H and L10L chickens. These cells may play a role in the immune response after an IBV infection since the number of TCRcd + CD8a + cells was higher in the infected L10H chickens than in the L10L chickens. The number of monocytes was also higher in L10H chickens than in L10L chickens, which may have influenced the decreased viral load in the trachea. Thus, these results indicate that MBL is produced locally and may be involved in the regulation of the cellular immune response after an IBV infection. However, MBL did not appear to influence the humoral immune response after an IBV infection in the current study.",

(A) Multiple-color gating strategy for T-cell subsets. The gating strategy is shown for the identification of T-cell subsets through singlet and small lymphocyte gating. EDTA blood was stained with anti-TCRcd -FITC, anti-CD4-R-PE, and anti-CD8a-Cy5. (B) Multiplecolor gating strategy for B cells and monocytes. The gating strategy is shown for the identification of B cells through singlet and small lymphocyte gating as well as identification of monocytes through singlet gating. EDTA blood was stained with anti-Bu-1-FITC and anti-Monocyte-R-PE. The Flow-Count\u00d4 fluorospheres were identified by FSC/Cy5-5 gating.",
