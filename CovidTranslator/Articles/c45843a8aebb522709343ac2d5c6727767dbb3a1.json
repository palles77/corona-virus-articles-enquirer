The periods of respiratory shedding of BCV were determined by direct immunofluorescent (DIF) staining of nasal epithelial cells and ELISA of nasal swab supernatant fluids. The periods of fecal shedding of BCV were determined by ELISA and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM). The isotype-specific antibody titers to BCV in serum (at selected intervals between 0 and 120 days of age) and the post-suckling (24 to 48 h after birth) total immunoglobulin levels were examined by ELISA and zinc sulfate turbidity tests, respectively.",

Serological antibody titer increases occurred in 3 calves before 30 days of age and in 4 calves after 30 days of age; two of the latter calves had a second rise in serum antibody titers to BCV after the initial rise. A serological antibody titer increase was not observed in one calf. This suggests that BCV infections may be very common in a closed herd and may occur in older calves, although many may be subclinical and some may be recurrent.",

In addition, BCV also causes infection of the upper respiratory tract inducing mild clinical signs in experimentally or naturally-infected calves (McNulty et al., 1984; Reynolds et al., 1985; Singh et al., 1985; Saif et al., 1986; Heckert et al., 1988; Heckert et al., 1989) . There are few published reports describing the prevalence or epidemiology of BCV respiratory or enteric infections in calves in the U.S. Few prospective longitudinal studies of BCV infections have been done; therefore, it is not known if older calves become infected or if reinfections or reactivation of chronic infections are common. Ellens et al. (1979) showed seroconversion in 62% (8/13) of calves less than 3 months old and thereafter significant antibody titer increases in 100% (13/13) of animals studied. In a preliminary study, we found that BCV infections are endemic in some herds and that older calves can have recrudescent respiratory BCV infections at least up to 65 days of age (Heckert et al., 1988) .",

Rectal swabs/feces and nasal swabs were collected, rectal temperatures were recorded and clinical signs noted three times per week (Saifet al., 1986) . Fecal consistency was scored on a scale of 0 to 3, with 0 representing firm feces, 1 pasty feces, 2 semiliquid and 3 liquid. Upper respiratory tract signs were scored on a similar scale with 0 representing a normal amount and consistency of lacrimal, nasal and salivary secretions; 1, excessive clear secretions; and 2, cloudy thick secretions. Blood was drawn from calves every other week in herd A and weekly in herd B. Fecal samples were stored at -20' C after collection and processed for IEM, using procedures similar to those described previously (Saif et al., 1977) . IEM was done on all samples, collected from 0 to 120 days of age, which had a fecal score of 2 or 3. Briefly, fecal samples were processed and incubated overnight at 4' C with hyperimmune bovine anti-BCV (1: 400).

Most calves began with high passive antibody titers to BCV associated with all isotypes which decayed over time. A >/4-fold rise in antibody titers to BCV with at least one isotype was seen in 7 or 8 animals at some point in the study (Table 2) . Increases in antibody titers were generally first observed with IgM and IgA, followed by IgG1 and IgG2 after 1 or 2 weeks. An example of the BCV isotypespecific changes seen is shown for calf #6 (Fig. 1) , which is similar to the responses seen in other calves. One calf (#4, herd A) was unique by having low levels of passive antibodies initially, a rapid decline in titers and then a very dramatic increase in all isotype antibody titers except IgA { which showed no change). Two calves (#2 and 7) showed recurrent rises in BCV isotype titers (IgA, IgG2 and IgM) after the initial antibody titer rise (Table 2 ). This is illustrated by the responses seen in calf #7 (Fig. 2) in which >~ 4-fold rises were seen with IgM and IgG2 at 10 and 16 weeks of age, respectively. Levels of total serum Ig content, BCV isotype-specific antibody titers at 24-48 h of age and number of sick days during the study for calves in study 1 are shown in Table 3 . The Spearman correlation coefficients between the ZST levels and the BCV specific antibody isotype titers were rs=O.191, 0.12, 0.16 and 0.55 for IgG1, IgG2, IgA and IgM, respectively. The Spearman correlation coefficients between the various antibody isotypes and number of days with diarrhea were rs=0.48, 0.04, 0.60 and 0.41 for IgG1, IgG2, IgA and IgM, respectively. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the ZST levels and the number of days with diarrhea was rs=O.13. Correlations were not done between number of days with respiratory disease and ZST or antibody isotype titers because there were only three calves (#1, 4 and 7) which had incidences of respiratory disease with a score > 2. None of these correlations were significantly different from zero in a two tailed test at a significance level of 0.05. There was however, a significantly (P=0.0009) greater number of average days with diarrhea in calves which had BCV specific antibody isotype titers less than the mean BCV specific IgA titer (log 10) for the 8 calves. There were no significant differences in the average number of days with diarrhea between calves having greater than or less than the mean IgG1, IgG2 and IgM BCV specific antibody isotype titers, with P values of 0.076, 0.91, and 0.91, respectively (Table 3) . A t-test of association between ZST levels and BCV specific antibody isotype titers were not done due to the skewed ZST values; however, by inspection the highest ZST values were associated with the highest BCV specific titers of all isotypes (Table 3) .",

This agrees with the results of previous studies which showed that older calves can have BCV serological antibody titer increases during the first 9 months of life (Ellens et al., 1979) . Two calves showed IgM or IgA serum antibody titer increases but little if any IgG1 or IgG2 titer increase (Table 2 ). These were generally calves which had the highest BCV specific passive antibody titers. It has been shown that high levels of passive antibodies can reduce both the active systemic and local immune responses to bovine RSV (Kimman et al., 1987) or bovine PI3 virus (Marshall and Frank, 1975) and the IgA and IgM active immune responses to rotavirus infection (Saif and Smith, 1985; Van Zaane et al., 1986; Saif et al., 1987 ) . From our limited data this type of suppression appears to be true for active systemic antibody responses to BCV infection as well and may explain why several calves did not show BCV specific antibody titer increases with some isotypes after infection. As suggested for RSV infection (Kimman et al., 1987) , only an IgM BCV specific serum titer increase may be a useful indicator of a recent BCV infection in diagnostic serological tests.",

There was however a statistically significant association (by t test) between low IgA BCV-specific serum titers (24-48 h after birth) and greater average number of days with diarrhea (Table 3) , as shown by others for IgA (Fisher and Martinez, 1978) .

It has been shown that high serum antibody titers to enteric viral pathogens do not always correlate well with protection (Hooper and Haelterman, 1966) . The titer of local antibodies in respiratory or intestinal secretions may correlate better with protection from disease. Therefore the poor correlation between serum antibody titers and the frequency of enteric disease was not surprising. In addition, since ELISA is a quantitative measure of antibody binding and not necessarily a measure of protective ability it may be expected that antibody titer assessment by ELISA would correlate poorly with protection from disease, unlike other functional measures like the virus neutralization test, which may correlate better. This demonstrates that determination of risk for disease or infection by BCV in neonatal calves may need to involve more than quantitation of total serum Ig or BCV isotype specific ELISA antibody titers at birth (except IgA). The association between low IgA BCV specific serum titers (at birth ) and diarrhea may indicate that IgA titers (at birth ) may be good predictors of neonatal enteritis, although a larger number of samples than was used in this study would be needed to confirm these observations.",

Calf # 6 showed clinical signs of diarrhea and fecal viral shedding after respi-ratory infection and therefore may have had a BCV respiratory infection prior to the enteric infection (Table 2 ) . However, calf #4 (herd A) shed BCV in the feces (as determined by EM and ELISA) prior to having positive nasal epithelial cells by DIF (Table 2) .

This indicates that BCV infections may be very common in a closed herd but that many may be subclinical. Respiratory infections with BCV may play an important role in the epidemiology and transmission of BCV among susceptible calves. However, in this study of a limited number of calves from two well-managed closed herds, only mild signs of respiratory disease were observed in association with BCV infections of the respiratory tract.",
