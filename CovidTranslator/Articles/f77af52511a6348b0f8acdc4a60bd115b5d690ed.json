            "text": "Acute diarrhea -A diarrheal illness of less than 14 days duration. Acute diarrheal disease in children is most often the result of self-limited viral infections. Management includes prompt assessment and repletion of hydration status. Evaluation for an etiologic process is generally not warranted unless there is an associated finding such as blood in the stool or systemic symptoms. Chronic diarrhea -A diarrheal illness of greater than 14 days duration. Chronic diarrhea in children can be due to either infectious or noninfectious processes. Evaluation for a specific etiology is indicated. Management of comorbid conditions such as poor growth or malnutrition is essential. Colitis -Any inflammatory process affecting the colon. Colitis usually presents clinically as bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and tenesmus. Congenital diarrhea -A group of diarrheal illnesses that are present from birth. Congenital diarrhea can be the result of either a specific genetic defect in a secretory or absorptive pathway or abnormal intestinal development. Gastroenteritis -A diarrheal process that affects the upper gastrointestinal tract and presents most typically as an acute watery diarrhea. Gastroenteritis usually denotes an acute diarrhea that is infectious and self-limiting. Hemolytic uremic syndrome -A sequela of Escherichia coli O157:H7 colitis. This toxinmediated microangiopathy results in a triad of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. The occurrence of the syndrome is generally limited to children under 10 years of age. Inflammatory diarrhea -A diarrheal illness in which the predominant pathologic finding is an invasion of the intestinal epithelium by immunocytes. This type of diarrhea can be the result of either a normal immune response to an abnormal environment, as in infection, or an abnormal immune response to a normal environment, as in inflammatory bowel disease. IPEX syndrome (Immunodysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, and enteropathy: X-linked) -An inherited X-linked syndrome that results from a mutation in the FOXP3 gene in humans. It is characterized by autoimmune enteropathy and multiple endocrinological abnormalities including diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and hemolytic anemia. Osmotic diarrhea -A diarrheal illness that is driven by osmotic forces that promote a net flux of water out of the interstitium and into the intestinal lumen. A stool sodium level of mEq l \u00c01 and an osmotic gap of greater than 100 mosm l \u00c01 suggest an osmotic diarrhea. Secretory diarrhea -A diarrheal illness that is driven by the active secretion of salt and water by intestinal epithelial cells. A stool sodium level of greater than 70 mEq l \u00c01 , an osmotic gap of less than 100 mosm l \u00c01 , and a failure of the diarrhea to respond to a controlled fast suggest a secretory diarrhea.",

There has therefore remained a lack of a consensus as to how diarrheal illness should be defined. Investigators have employed a number of qualitative and quantitative dimensions of stool output to address this issue in the past. For the most part, children pass between one and three stools, or approximately 5-10 ml of stool per kilogram of body weight per day. As such, investigators have begun to use these benchmarks as the upper limits of normal in their identification of subjects in studies addressing acute or chronic diarrheal disease.",

Adults typically ingest approximately 2 l of fluid per day and produce an additional 9 l in the form of salivary, gastric, small intestinal, and pancreato-biliary secretions, to complete the process of digestion. The small intestine and colon have evolved highly efficient intercellular and transcellular pathways for the reabsorption of the vast majority (approximately 99%) of this intestinal fluid, and the average adult will pass only approximately 200 g of stool per day. This balance between fluid secretion and absorption is therefore quite tight. Any microbiologic, dietary, pharmacologic, or hormonal input that affects cell membrane transporters and/or the intercellular tight junctions responsible for fluid absorption can tip this net fluid balance in favor of secretion (or reduced absorption) and thereby trigger the increased stool output observed in patients with diarrheal illnesses.",

            "text": "in the intestine conducted by CLCA appears to be limited by the generation of the intracellular down-regulatory intermediates inositol-3, 4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate, and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Whereas Cl \u00c0 secretion drives intestinal fluid secretion, fluid absorption is mediated primarily by the vectorial transport of Na \u00fe ions out of the intestinal lumen and into the interstitium. Na \u00fe transport can be electrogenic (as in the case of apical Na \u00fe channels), Na \u00fe -coupled, or electroneutral. The accumulation of absorbed Na \u00fe ions in the tissue interstitium favors the subsequent movement of Cl \u00c0 ions and water molecules out of the intestinal lumen via transcellular and paracellular pathways, thereby effecting salt and water uptake. Na \u00fe channels have been identified in the apical membrane of the epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract. By acting in a coupled fashion with basolateral membrane Na \u00fe /K \u00fe -ATPase pumps, these channels permit lumenal Na \u00fe ions to move down their electrochemical gradient and into the cell. The favorable Na \u00fe gradient established by Na \u00fe /K \u00fe pumps has also been exploited by the small intestine to promote nutrient absorption. SGLT1 is the Na \u00fe -coupled glucose transporter expressed along the apical membrane of enterocytes. Similarly, Na \u00fe uptake in the small intestine is effected through Na \u00fe -coupled amino acid transporters that are present along the enterocyte brush border. Finally, the Na \u00fe /H \u00fe exchanger NHE-3, expressed in the apical membrane of enterocytes, appears to mediate electroneutral Na \u00fe transport in the intestine.",

Cells newly differentiated at the crypt base display a primarily secretory phenotype and express high levels of CFTR. As these cells mature and migrate up the axis to take up more villous positions, they express increasing numbers of absorptive proteins including NHE-3 and Na \u00fe -coupled glucose and amino acid transporters. Stool output is therefore the net product of intestinal fluid secretion originating in crypt cells (which occupy approximately one-third of the crypt-villus axis) and fluid absorption from villus cells (which take up the remaining two-thirds of the crypt-villus axis). Any disorder damaging surface villi, and thereby decreasing the villus/crypt ratio, will selectively decrease mucosal absorptive potential and cause increased stool output. This explains the increased stool output observed in patients with celiac disease, postviral syndromes, and giardiasis.",

Components of the child's overall health, such as atopy or immunodeficiency, can also suggest a particular etiology.

Children, and most especially infants, are more susceptible to dehydration than their adult counterparts.

Poor growth and malnutrition can also become a factor in children when diarrhea is chronic in nature. During infancy and early childhood, a large proportion of caloric intake is devoted to growth.

All children exposed to rotavirus, regardless of whether or not they manifest symptomatic diarrhea, will develop circulating antibodies to this pathogen. The decreasing incidence of rotavirus in adults is thought to be due to the protective effect of these antibodies. Rotaviruses are small, wheel-shaped viruses approximately 70 nm in diameter. Of the four major groups (A, B, C, and D), type A viruses are the most important in children. The virus invades the epithelium and promotes an inflammatory response that ultimately contributes to the destruction of the villous surface. However, the frequency and severity of stool output in these patients does not correlate closely with the degree of intestinal damage observed endoscopically or histologically. This has led to the speculation that there are other pathogenic mechanisms that contribute to the malabsorption and net fluid losses observed in these patients.

As in the case of viral diarrhea, the onset of bacterial illness is usually acute and presents with fever and sometimes vomiting. Because the most common forms of bacterial diarrhea are invasive, bloody diarrhea is often reported in these patients. Specific types of bacterial illness have been reported to occur more commonly in specific age groups. Campylobacter jejuni, for instance, has a bimodal distribution of onset with the first peak occurring in children from 1 to 5 years old and a second peak in adolescents. Nontyphoid Salmonella enteritidis can cause a bacteremia in infants and in immunocompromised hosts. Shigella species can be found in the toddler age group, but is not a commonly isolated pathogen in the US. Clostridium difficile, an important cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults, is not usually a pathogen in infants. C. difficile toxin can be found in up to 10% of healthy newborns and is even more prevalent in neonatal intensive care units. The reason for the inability of this organism to cause diarrhea in infants remains unclear. Based on animal studies, it is thought that the receptor for this toxin is developmentally regulated and absent in early infancy. Vibrio cholerae causes a prototypical bacterial secretory diarrhea. It produces a toxin composed of two subunits. The B, or binding, subunit displays a pentameric form that binds selectively to the ganglioside GM 1 . The A, or active, subunit is internalized by intestinal epithelia, alters signal transduction, and leads to increased production of cAMP and Cl \u00c0 secretion. Other forms of toxin-producing organisms include enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, the pathogen responsible for traveler's diarrhea, and organisms responsible for acute food poisoning such as Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. E. coli O157:H7 is an important pathogen in children. This enteropathic E. coli adheres to the intestinal lumen and produces a toxin that is absorbed and causes the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Parasitic disease causing diarrhea is far less common in industrialized countries ( Table 1 , part C). One notable exception is Giardia lamblia, which is especially prevalent in the daycare setting. Giardia can present as an acute diarrheal illness or as a more chronic process. The mechanism by which this organism causes diarrhea is not fully understood. There is no gross alteration in intestinal architecture or evidence of a significant immunologic response. There are multiple other parasites that can cause diarrheal disease in children.

Congenital chloride diarrhea is caused by a mutation in the down-regulated in adenoma (DRA) gene, thought to be a colonic chloride transporter. This disease presents uniformly in utero with polyhydramnios. Severe diarrhea and abdominal distension appear shortly after birth and profound electrolyte disturbances can occur in these patients if not resuscitated promptly. In contrast, the cause of congenital sodium diarrhea is not known but is thought to be due to a functional uncoupling of sodium and hydrogen exchange in the intestine. No mutations have been described in the known Na \u00fe /H \u00fe exchangers in the intestine to date. The clinical presentation of congenital sodium diarrhea is similar to congenital chloride diarrhea with the exception that stool chloride levels in these patients are typically lower and the stool pH tends to be more alkaline. In addition to defects in ion transporters, there have been a number of diseases that have been described with altered transport of glucose, galactose, and amino acids. Gastrointestinal symptoms vary from defect to defect. Amino acid transport defects often have extraintestinal manifestations whose consequences far outweigh changes in bowel patterns.",

Congenital disaccharidase deficiencies are rare and result in an osmotically driven diarrhea. Much more common are the transient and secondary deficiencies in mucosal disaccharidase levels that result from small intestinal injury or inflammation. Fat malabsorption can also present with diarrhea of variable severity. Congenital fat malabsorption can be the result of pancreatic insufficiency, seen in patients with cystic fibrosis, or due to specific genetic defects such as abetalipoproteinemia. Fat malabsorption is characterized by varying degrees of greasy and malodorous stools. Finally, congenital disorders of the intestinal architecture can lead to diarrhea. Microvillus inclusion disease is a rare autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by severe watery diarrhea at birth. Diagnosis is based on a histologic demonstration of marked or complete villous atrophy and electron microscopic evidence of intracellular microvillus inclusions and absent or rare microvilli.",

Often, these diarrheas result from a predisposing insult that diminishes the ability of the intestinal mucosa to absorb nutrients, thereby contributing to an osmotic diarrhea. The most common example of this is toddler's diarrhea or chronic nonspecific diarrhea of childhood. There is no underlying inflammatory or biochemical abnormality that drives the increased stool output seen in these young children. In many cases, these patients will respond to a reduced dietary intake of fruit juices. Because many of these juices contain large amounts of sorbitol, an indigestible carbohydrate, they can induce an osmotic diarrhea. As such, the diarrhea will resolve in most patients within a few days after removal of the offending juice. Other examples of acquired and primarily noninflammatory diarrheas that fall into this category include antibiotic-associated diarrhea, short bowel syndrome, and small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Additionally, M\u00fcnchausen's syndrome-by-proxy must always be considered in children with diarrhea and no predisposing factors.",

In contrast, these studies should be negative in patients with noninflammatory (viral, osmotic, or secretory) diarrheal disease.

Stool evaluation for fat, pH, and reducing substances is important in determining whether or not there is an underlying malabsorptive process. The presence of 'neutral' fat in the stool suggests some deficiency in the production or delivery of pancreatic (lipase) or hepatic (bile acid) secretions into the intestinal lumen. An increase in 'split' fat in the stool indicates a primary inability of enterocytes to perform fat absorption. Reducing substances are the result of undigested carbohydrates making their way into the large intestine. The presence of these fecal sugars can be readily assessed with commercially available colorimetric strips or test solutions. It must be remembered that sucrose is a nonreducing sugar. As such, stool must first be pretreated with an acid solution to make this nonreducing sugar detectable. Undigested carbohydrates, as well as dietary fiber, are consumed by bacteria in the large bowel and generate short-chain fatty acids. Carbohydrate malabsorption can therefore also be assessed by a fall in stool pH.",

First and foremost in the treatment of any child with diarrhea is a prompt assessment of hydration status. For most cases of mild to moderate diarrhea, oral rehydration solutions are the first line of therapy. When oral intake is limited secondary to an altered mental status or when severe dehydration or shock is present, intravenous replacement of fluid and electrolytes can be lifesaving. Once the patient is adequately hydrated, the diet may be readily advanced. The provision of adequate calories is critical to maintain an anabolic state that will provide the metabolic fuel necessary to promote epithelial restitution. The advantages of enteral supplementation should not be overlooked as lumenal contents have been shown to be trophic to the intestinal epithelium. A transient lactose intolerance may occur in either acute or chronic diarrhea. This can be addressed using soy, rice-based, or lactose-free milk products. High-fructose and sorbitolcontaining drinks are palatable, but should be avoided due to the increased osmotic load they place on an already compromised epithelial lining. Other supportive measures that have been used include antisecretory agents, antimotility agents, and resin binders. These agents decrease overall stool output by slowing intestinal transit. Although clinically beneficial in most cases, clinicians must be wary of the possibility that these agents can contribute to third-spacing of body fluid in distended and pharmacologically atonic intestinal loops.",
