A conceptual framework has recently been proposed that illustrates the need for hospital readiness and good quality clinical practice for the dual aspects of identification and care of critically ill patients (appendix). 5 Hospitals should establish effective systems for triage and essential care in emergency units and wards, including patient separation and staff safety. User-friendly, concise protocols should be developed, disseminated, and implemented for good quality and feasible clinical care, with WHO's leadership and through national authorities. Simple physiological signs have been shown to identify critical illness, and single-parameter systems might be easier to use than compound scores. The central role of oxygen therapy should be emphasised, oxygen supplies and delivery systems secured, and guidelines for sustainable and appropriate use issued. Other essential care includes a head-up patient position, suction, and simple chest physiotherapy. When human resources are limited, such care can be implemented by less trained health workers or vital-signs assistants through a protocolised approach and task sharing.",

Data from hospital wards in Malawi showed that 89% of hypoxic patients (oxygen saturation <90%) were not receiving oxygen, and 53% of unconscious patients (Glasgow Coma Scale <9) were being nursed supine without a protected airway (unpublished data).",
