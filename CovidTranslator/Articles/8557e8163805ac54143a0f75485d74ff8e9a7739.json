Acknowledging the importance of assessing medical students' clinical competences objectively, the author (KML) proposed the establishment of a clinical skills center (CSC) and an OSCE program based on his experience at the University of Arkansas for Medical Science (Little Rock, AK, USA). The proposal received strong support from the President of KMU and the Dean of KMU Medical College (CHH), as well as a 2 years funding from the Ministry of Education (MOE), Taiwan.

The questionnaire included semi-structured questions about their reasons for joining the SP program, and their opinions on students' performance. The responses of SPs are summarized in Appendix 2. Both students and patients stated that being a SP was a worthwhile experience.",

One of the two medical schools used senior medical residents as SPs to evaluate its medical students' clinical competence [19] . The residents wrote the patient cases and played the patient's role. The advantages of using residents as SPs are that residents can give students instructions and constructive feedback from a professional point of view. Other reasons for using residents as SPs are that maintaining an SP program is resource demanding, and people in Taiwan are usually too reserved to participate in such an innovative program. However, the disadvantages of using residents as SPs probably outnumber the advantages. For instance, students are not likely to view their teachers as patients, and sometimes can even guess what the case problem might be judging from the resident's specialty. It is also a problem if there are personality conflicts between the students and residents when working together. This may produce a bias when the resident is grading the student.",

One of our SPs had more than eight surgeries in recent years, which made him an expert on being a patient, and he and his wife were eager to share their views on patients with the students. Senior clerkship students were willing to help the learning of the juniors even though they had heavy workloads, and they thought that being SPs were also a good learning experience for themselves. An advantage of using laypersons in our experience is that students generally would avoid using medical terms when communicating with patients. They would also use Taiwanese (a dialect in Taiwan) to communicate with those who could not speak or understand Mandarin.",

To achieve this objective, KMU wishes to provide a well-rounded training program which emphasizes students' clinical skills, communication skills, altruism, and attitudes as much as their medical knowledge. To assess such clinical competences, KMU introduced and implemented the OSCE. It is important to organize and plan the OSCE carefully to ensure that the strength of this assessment method can be achieved [22] . In this study, we described the process of establishing an OSCE program at KMU that had no previous experience in the OSCE. As the OSCE is now widely used to assess clinical competences of students in medical education [23, 24] , as well as in other professional health education such as dentistry [9, 25] , nursing [26, 27] , pharmacy [28, 29] , physiotherapy [30] , and radiation therapy [31] , we are currently sharing our experience with the other colleges at KMU.

I thought this experience could give me a chance to understand patient's feelings and thoughts. 2. I could improve my understanding of what information should have been obtained by a physician. 3. I could improve my history taking and communication skills. 4. I was interested in the SP program and medical education in general, and thought this would be an interesting and meaningful experience.Hospital staff, patients, and others:1. I thought it would be very educational and would benefit both students and patients.2. This would be a chance to help medical students develop their history taking and communication skills.3. I was a volunteer in KMU hospital, and I was very happy to join this program.Q2. In your opinion as an SP, what and where did the student do well in the physician-patient interactions?Medical students:1. As the students rotated through the eight stations, they became more experienced and performed better than the previous groups. 2. They were polite and friendly. 3. They cared for the patients and listened to them attentively. 4. Their attitudes were good, and I hope they will use the same attitudes when they face real patients.Hospital staff, patients, and others:1. Most of the students were friendly when taking a case history, and they were able to elicit the patient's problem. 2. The students were very cautious. 3. They learned fast, and their skills improved perceptibly in a very short period of time. 4. The students were knowledgeable and patient.Q3. In your opinion as an SP, what and where did the student need to improve in the physician-patient interactions?KMU students:1. The students should think of themselves as doctors, and they should be more confident and encouraging. 2. Their thoughts should be more organized when asking questions and abstracting patient history. 3. They need to be compassionate. 4. They need to improve their knowledge and need more experience to apply the knowledge adequately.Hospital staff, patients, and others:1. The students were nervous and unorganized. They focused on the patient's problem and cared little about their feeling in the first few stations, but they improved as they got used to the exam format. 2. Some students need to improve their attitudes and skills, and show more compassion, friendliness, and courtesy.They need better communication skills, and their questioning needs to be more organized for abstracting patient's history. 3. Some students could not speak Taiwanese fluently; if they could communicate in Taiwanese, the physician-patient interactions would be friendlier.",
