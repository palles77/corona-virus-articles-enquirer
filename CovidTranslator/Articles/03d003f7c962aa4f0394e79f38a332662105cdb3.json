            "text": "Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common and costly condition in young children. 1 The annual global incidence of AOM is 700 million per year and 50% of those affected are children under the age of 5 years. 2 By age 3 years, 84% of children have had at least one episode of AOM and F o r p e e r r e v i e w o n l y 46% have had 3 or more episodes. 3 Antibiotic treatment has only a modest effect on AOM duration 4 and does not prevent serious complications such as mastoiditis or meningitis which can rarely be fatal. 5 6 Most (>80%) children with AOM presenting for care have spontaneous symptom resolution within 3 days and the number needed to treat for antibiotic treatment to reduce symptom duration is 20 days, which must be balanced by a number needed to harm (with adverse effects of antibiotics such as diarrhea) of 14 days. 4 The incidence of mastoiditis has not changed over time despite changes in antibiotic prescribing. 5 6 7 Rare sequelae of AOM include delayed cognitive development, impaired communication skills and permanent hearing loss. 3 Parents of children with otitis media report missing 2-3 days of work per episode. 1 Another common and costly infectious disease amongst North American pre-school aged children is upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). 8 9 10-12 URTIs are the most common reason for emergency department visits and unscheduled outpatient visits in Canada, accounting for 10% of emergency department visits for children under 10 years of age. 13 14 15 URTIs are also the most common reason for unscheduled visits to a care provider and Canadian children experience [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] URTIs per year at a cost to the healthcare system of several hundred million dollars per year. 16 17 Nearly 30% of 2-5 year old children have dental caries. 18 Dental caries may lead to pain, difficulty eating and speaking, and can harm a child's self-esteem. 19 Treating dental caries in young children is challenging for practitioners, painful for the children and caries cost thousands of dollars to treat, with complicated caries requiring hospitalization costing several times more (and rarely resulting in death). 20 21 22 23 24 25 In vitro studies have shown that xylitol can reduce the attachment of bacteria that cause AOM, URTIs, and dental caries such as Streptococcus Pneumoniae and Haemophilus Influenzae to nasopharyngeal cells. AOM occurs when the upper airway is colonized with bacteria, viruses or a combination of both that travel from the nasopharynx to the middle ear by way of the Eustachian tube. 26 A Cochrane systematic review of the safety and efficacy of xylitol in preventing AOM in children up to 12 years of age found that there is fair evidence supporting the use of xylitol for the prevention of AOM (risk ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.88 based on 3 RCTs from the same research group, studying 1826 children in total), but concluded that an adequatelypowered, well designed trial is necessary. 27 Previous trials have not established whether regular xylitol syrup use is effective at preventing AOM in young children (<4 years) who are most likely to have AOM. Several RCTs of xylitol for the prevention of dental caries indicate that the antimicrobial effect of xylitol (which is posited to account for its efficacy in preventing AOM) increases with duration of use. 28 29 30 Therefore, the effect of the same dose of xylitol may be more effective at preventing AOM over the 6 month study period in the proposed study than it was in the previous trials that lasted 2 or 3 months. 31 The longer trials of xylitol for the prevention of dental caries also demonstrate that daily xylitol administration is safe, feasible and well tolerated for the 6 month study period in the proposed trial. 28 29 30 A pilot study of higher concentrations of xylitol syrup in young children found good compliance and tolerability. 32 In summary, regular xylitol syrup used for the 6 month study period is safe and feasible, and there is clinical equipoise over its effectiveness at preventing AOM in young children. There is no recommendation for or against the use of xylitol in the United States or in Canada. The paucity of high quality randomized controlled trials has been cited as a reason for the lack of consistent recommendations regarding the use of xylitol in young children. 33 The primary purpose of this study is to determine if regular use of xylitol syrup effectively prevents AOM in unselected 2-4 year old children. Such an intervention could increase the productivity of parents and caregivers, reduce serious complications and reduce the suffering of young children -each episode of AOM involves several excess hours of crying for two to seven days. 34 This trial could change clinical practice if the results are positive. In several other countries xylitol is recommended for the prevention of dental caries. For example, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentists recommends regular xylitol use for the prevention of dental caries based on the results of eight clinical trials. 35 However, a survey of American pediatricians found that few physicians (12%) recommend xylitol to patients and that most would either definitely (68%) or possibly (29%) recommend xylitol if there was additional evidence that it prevented AOM. 36 ",

In order to make a diagnosis of AOM for this trial, the chart must contain both the documentation of signs of AOM (e.g. erythematous tympanic membrane) plus the practitioners' diagnosis that the patient had AOM. The addition of tympanometry to clinical signs does not improve the accuracy of AOM diagnosis. 41 Further, tympanometry is not employed in routine clinical practice at any of the TARGet Kids! sites. Tympanocentesis is therapeutic and can prevent subsequent AOM episodes 40 so it cannot be used in this trial of AOM prevention (and it requires instruments not present in primary care sites). Four of the five previous trials of xylitol for the prevention of AOM employed clinical signs with tympanometry, and one used clinical signs to determine the number of AOM episodes. 31 Previous RCTs of AOM management in young children have relied on the diagnoses made by primary care providers (who are generally the clinicians who diagnose AOM for clinical purposes). 42 43 The studies, involving longer study periods, used chart reviews to determine the number of AOM episodes just as we will in this trial (Appendix 1). 43 We have conducted a chart review of 1,637 patients in the TARGet Kids! research network using a method similar to those in completed RCTs of AOM that involves reviewing charts for physical examination findings consistent with AOM and a diagnosis or assessment of AOM. 44 42 43 In all of the episodes, the physical examination findings and the diagnosis were clearly documented in the chart (the term \"AOM\" was usually recorded in the assessment portion of the note), and there was perfect agreement between independent reviewers.",

A challenge in all trials that employ AOM as an outcome is the combined effect of two factors: (1) parents often decide not to seek care when a child has symptoms that may indicate AOM and (2) parents cannot distinguish between AOM and other URTIs because the symptoms are similar. We will address this challenge with our secondary outcome: parent-reported URTIs, a very common and costly (in aggregate) condition in early childhood. 17 46 The previous shorter (2 to 3 month) trials of xylitol found a non-significant trend towards fewer URTI episodes in children receiving xylitol. 31 A cohort study of children aged 2 months to 12 years receiving care at Toronto primary care sites found that medical consultation was sought in only 56% of episodes of URTI symptoms. 47 This is not surprising given that guidelines recommend against antibiotics for AOM and other URTIs in many cases. As many parents are aware of this recommendation from previous clinic visits, they may decide to treat children with analgesics and antipyretics without seeking care even if they believe the child has an AOM. 48 Thus, information about the total number of URTI episodes must be obtained directly from parents and caregivers as it will not be found in a patient's medical record even if it includes records from all institutions and clinics. Parents may not diagnose AOM accurately based on symptoms because they overlap substantially with symptoms of URTIs. 49 Irritability and crying are the most common symptoms in AOM and URTI episodes. 50 Forty percent of children with AOM do not have an earache and 31% do not have a fever, 49 while 72% of children without AOM exhibit symptoms of AOM (crying, fever or ear ache). 50 Like previous studies, we will employ structured telephone interviews to assess the number of URTI episodes. 51 52 53 Parents or caregivers will be contacted every month and asked to report the number of URTIs the child has experienced since the last call (or since the beginning of the trial for the first call) using validated questions (Appendix 1). 53 We will employ the symptoms in the Canadian Acute Respiratory Illness and Flu (CARIF) scale that has been validated in this population. 54 The secondary outcome, parent-reported dental caries, will also be assessed during the monthly phone calls. Parents or caregivers will be asked if they have been informed by a dentist or a physician that their child has or has had at least one or more dental caries (Appendix 1). This question has been used and validated in several epidemiological studies. 55 56 57 58 The dental caries secondary outcome will be binary (at least one versus none). Those with caries at baseline will be excluded from this analysis but included in all other analyses.",

The use of net benefit regression allows the economic evaluation to be conducted using regression methods (adjusting for potential confounders). The main outcome of the economic evaluation will be an incremental net benefit of xylitol syrup (in term of cost and number of physician-diagnosed AOM episodes) compared to control. In addition, we will estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (e.g., an incremental cost per one physician-diagnosed AOM episode avoided and an incremental cost per one URTI episode avoided). Statistical uncertainty will be characterized using a 95% confidence interval and costeffectiveness acceptability curves. 60 Compliance (reported number of doses given per week) will be assessed during the monthly calls and by tallying the number of returned doses at the end of the study.",

A 20% RRR was chosen based on previous surveys of reasons physicians do not currently recommend xylitol and the RRR used in previous trials. 31 36 The sample size calculations assumed a Poisson distribution for the number of AOM episodes and were based on the asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio test statistic. Calculations were performed in R (2.15.3) using the asypow package and power was confirmed via 10,000 simulations. The required sample size is 236 per group. (Note that while the number of participants is less than one of the previous trials 61 , the mean treatment and follow-up period in our study will be longer.)The above calculations take into consideration non-compliance and a loss to follow-up of 10% of participants only completing 50% of the follow-up period. These calculations assume there will be no substantial contamination. While xylitol preparations are commercially available, the dose of xylitol is less than one-tenth the dose found in trials to be effective at preventing AOM. A survey of TARGet Kids! participants showed that xylitol use is rare (< 5%). Siblings of those already enrolled in the trial will be excluded since contamination would be likely if two members of the family are enrolled and allocated to different arms.",

AOM occurs when the upper airway is colonized with bacteria, viruses or a combination of both that travel from the nasopharynx to the middle ear by way of the Eustachian tube. 27 A Cochrane systematic review of the safety and efficacy of xylitol in preventing AOM in children up to 12 years of age found that there is fair evidence supporting the use of xylitol for the prevention of AOM (risk ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.88 based on 3 RCTs from the same research group, studying 1826 children in total), but concluded that an adequatelypowered, well designed trial is necessary. 28 Previous trials have not established whether regular xylitol syrup use is effective at preventing AOM in young children (<4 years) who are most likely to have AOM. Several RCTs of xylitol for the prevention of dental caries indicate that the antimicrobial effect of xylitol (which is posited to account for its efficacy in preventing AOM) increases with duration of use. 29 30 31 Therefore, the effect of the same dose of xylitol may be more effective at preventing AOM over the 6 month study period in the proposed study than it was in the previous trials that lasted 2 or 3 months. 32 The longer trials of xylitol for the prevention of dental caries also demonstrate that daily xylitol administration is safe, feasible and well tolerated for the 6 month study period in the proposed trial. 29 30 31 A pilot study of higher concentrations of xylitol syrup in young children found good compliance and tolerability. 33 In summary, regular xylitol syrup used for the 6 month study period is safe and feasible, and there is clinical equipoise over its effectiveness at preventing AOM in young children. There is no recommendation for or against the use of xylitol in the United States or in Canada. The paucity of high quality randomized controlled trials has been cited as a reason for the lack of consistent recommendations regarding the use of xylitol in young children. 34 The primary purpose of this study is to determine if regular use of xylitol syrup effectively prevents AOM in unselected 2-4 year old children. Such an intervention could increase the productivity of parents and caregivers, reduce serious complications and reduce the suffering of young children -each episode of AOM involves several excess hours of crying for two to seven days. 35 This trial could change clinical practice if the results are positive. In several other countries xylitol is recommended for the prevention of dental caries. For example, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentists recommends regular xylitol use for the prevention of dental caries based on the results of eight clinical trials. 36 However, a survey of American pediatricians found that few physicians (12%) recommend xylitol to patients and that most would either definitely (68%) or possibly (29%) recommend xylitol if there was additional evidence that it prevented AOM. 37",

In order to make a diagnosis of AOM for this trial, the chart must contain both the documentation of signs of AOM (e.g. erythematous tympanic membrane) plus the practitioners' diagnosis that the patient had AOM. The addition of tympanometry to clinical signs does not necessarily improve the accuracy of AOM diagnosis. 42 Although tympanometry is recommended by some guidelines, it is not employed in routine clinical practice at any of the TARGet Kids! sites. Tympanocentesis is therapeutic and can prevent subsequent AOM episodes 41 so it cannot be used in this trial of AOM prevention (and it requires instruments not present in primary care sites). Four of the five previous trials of xylitol for the prevention of AOM employed clinical signs with tympanometry, and one used clinical signs to determine the number of AOM episodes. 32 Previous RCTs of AOM management in young children have relied on the diagnoses made by primary care providers (who are generally the clinicians who diagnose AOM for clinical purposes). 43 44 The studies, involving longer study periods, used chart reviews to determine the number of AOM episodes just as we will in this trial (Appendix 1). 44 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y We have conducted a chart review of 1,637 patients in the TARGet Kids! research network using a method similar to those in completed RCTs of AOM that involves reviewing charts for physical examination findings consistent with AOM and a diagnosis or assessment of AOM. 45 43 44 In all of the episodes, the physical examination findings and the diagnosis were clearly documented in the chart (the term \"AOM\" was usually recorded in the assessment portion of the note), and there was perfect agreement between independent reviewers.",

A challenge in all trials that employ AOM as an outcome is the combined effect of two factors: (1) parents often decide not to seek care when a child has symptoms that may indicate AOM and (2) parents cannot distinguish between AOM and other URTIs because the symptoms are similar. We will address this challenge with our secondary outcome: parent-reported URTIs, a very common and costly (in aggregate) condition in early childhood. 17 48 The previous shorter (2 to 3 month) trials of xylitol found a non-significant trend towards fewer URTI episodes in children receiving xylitol. 32 A cohort study of children aged 2 months to 12 years receiving care at Toronto primary care sites found that medical consultation was sought in only 56% of episodes of URTI symptoms. 49 This is not surprising given that guidelines recommend against antibiotics for AOM and other URTIs in many cases. As many parents are aware of this recommendation from previous clinic visits, they may decide to treat children with analgesics and antipyretics without seeking care even if they believe the child has an AOM. 50 Thus, information about the total number of URTI episodes must be obtained directly from parents and caregivers as it will not be found in a patient's medical record even if it includes records from all institutions and clinics. Parents may not diagnose AOM accurately based on symptoms because they overlap substantially with symptoms of URTIs. 51 Irritability and crying are the most common symptoms in AOM and URTI episodes. 52 Forty percent of children with AOM do not have an earache and 51 while 72% of children without AOM exhibit symptoms of AOM (crying, fever or ear ache). 52 Like previous studies, we will employ structured telephone interviews to assess the number of URTI episodes. 53 54 55 Parents or caregivers will be contacted every month and asked to report the number of URTIs the child has experienced since the last call (or since the beginning of the trial for the first call) using validated questions (Appendix 1). 55 We will employ the symptoms in the Canadian Acute Respiratory Illness and Flu (CARIF) scale that has been validated in this population. 56 The secondary outcome, parent-reported dental caries, will also be assessed during the monthly phone calls. Parents or caregivers will be asked if they have been informed by a dentist or a physician that their child has or has had at least one or more dental caries (Appendix 1). This question has been used and validated in several epidemiological studies. 57 58 59 60 The dental caries secondary outcome will be binary (at least one versus none). Those with caries at baseline will be excluded from this analysis but included in all other analyses.",

In addition, we will estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (e.g., an incremental cost per one physician-diagnosed AOM episode avoided and an incremental cost per one URTI episode avoided).

A 20% RRR was chosen based on previous surveys of reasons physicians do not currently recommend xylitol and the RRR used in previous trials. 32 37 The sample size calculations assumed a Poisson distribution for the number of AOM episodes and were based on 3) using the asypow package and power was confirmed via 10,000 simulations. The required sample size is 236 per group. (Note that while the number of participants is less than one of the previous trials 63 , the mean treatment and follow-up period in our study will be longer.) The above calculations take into consideration non-compliance and a loss to follow-up of 10% of participants only completing 50% of the follow-up period. These calculations assume there will be no substantial contamination. While xylitol preparations are commercially available, the dose of xylitol is less than one-tenth the dose found in trials to be effective at preventing AOM.

The treatment effect, expressed as a rate ratio (relative risk), and 95% confidence interval will be obtained from the model. A secondary analysis will adjust for characteristics with an imbalance between groups at baseline. Patient demographics will be summarized descriptively (e.g., means and SD or median and IQR for continuous variables and frequency and percentages for categorical). Although randomization guarantees balance in the long-run, there is a chance of imbalances in any sample. The demographics will be reviewed for clinically important imbalances that may be adjusted for in a secondary analysis.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common and costly condition in young children. 1 The annual global incidence of AOM is 700 million per year and 50% of those affected are children under the age of 5 years. 2 By age 3 years, 84% of children have had at least one episode of AOM and 46% have had 3 or more episodes. 3 Antibiotic treatment has only a modest effect on AOM duration 4 and does not prevent serious complications such as mastoiditis or meningitis which can rarely be fatal. 5 6 Most (>80%) children with AOM presenting for care have spontaneous symptom resolution within 3 days and the number needed to treat for antibiotic treatment to reduce symptom duration is 20 days, which must be balanced by a number needed to harm (with adverse effects of antibiotics such as diarrhea) of 14 days. 4 The incidence of mastoiditis has not changed over time despite changes in antibiotic prescribing. 5 6 7 Rare sequelae of AOM include delayed cognitive development, impaired communication skills and permanent hearing loss. 3 Parents of children with otitis media report missing 2-3 days of work per episode. 1 Another common and costly infectious disease amongst North American pre-school aged children is upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). 8 9 10-12 URTIs are the most common reason for emergency department visits and unscheduled outpatient visits in Canada, accounting for 10% of emergency department visits for children under 10 years of age. 13 14 15 URTIs are also the most common reason for unscheduled visits to a care provider and Canadian children experience [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] URTIs per year at a cost to the healthcare system of several hundred million dollars per year. 16 17 18 Nearly 30% of 2-5 year old children have dental caries. 19 Dental caries may lead to pain, difficulty eating and speaking, and can harm a child's self-esteem. 20 Treating dental caries in young children is challenging for practitioners, painful for the children and caries cost thousands of dollars to treat, with complicated caries requiring hospitalization costing several times more (and rarely resulting in death). 21 22 23 24 25 26 In vitro studies have shown that xylitol can reduce the attachment of bacteria that cause AOM, URTIs, and dental caries such as Streptococcus Pneumoniae and Haemophilus Influenzae to nasopharyngeal cells. AOM occurs when the upper airway is colonized with bacteria, viruses or a combination of both that travel from the nasopharynx to the middle ear by way of the Eustachian tube. 27 A Cochrane systematic review of the safety and efficacy of xylitol in preventing AOM in children up to 12 years of age found that there is fair evidence supporting the use of xylitol for the prevention of AOM (risk ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.88 based on 3 RCTs from the same research group, studying 1826 children in total), but concluded that an adequatelypowered, well designed trial is necessary. 28 Previous trials have not established whether regular xylitol syrup use is effective at preventing AOM in young children (<4 years) who are most likely to have AOM. Several RCTs of xylitol for the prevention of dental caries indicate that the antimicrobial effect of xylitol (which is posited to account for its efficacy in preventing AOM) increases with duration of use. 29 30 31 Therefore, the effect of the same dose of xylitol may be more effective at preventing AOM over the 6 month study period in the proposed study than it was in the previous trials that lasted 2 or 3 months. 32 The longer trials of xylitol for the prevention of dental caries also demonstrate that daily xylitol administration is safe, feasible and well tolerated for the 6 month study period in the proposed trial. 29 30 31 A pilot study of higher concentrations of xylitol syrup in young children found good compliance and tolerability. 33 In summary, regular xylitol syrup used for the 6 month study period is safe and feasible, and there is clinical equipoise over its effectiveness at preventing AOM in young children. There is no recommendation for or against the use of xylitol in the United States or in Canada. The paucity of high quality randomized controlled trials has been cited as a reason for the lack of consistent recommendations regarding the use of xylitol in young children. 34 The primary purpose of this study is to determine if regular use of xylitol syrup effectively prevents AOM in unselected 2-4 year old children. Such an intervention could increase the productivity of parents and caregivers, reduce serious complications and reduce the suffering of young children -each episode of AOM involves several excess hours of crying for two to seven days. 35 This trial could change clinical practice if the results are positive. In several other countries xylitol is recommended for the prevention of dental caries. For example, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentists recommends regular xylitol use for the prevention of dental caries based on the results of eight clinical trials. 36 However, a survey of American pediatricians found that few physicians (12%) recommend xylitol to patients and that most would either definitely (68%) or possibly (29%) recommend xylitol if there was additional evidence that it prevented AOM. 37",

In order to make a diagnosis of AOM for this trial, the chart must contain both the documentation of signs of AOM (e.g. erythematous tympanic membrane) plus the practitioners' diagnosis that the patient had AOM. The addition of tympanometry to clinical signs does not necessarily improve the accuracy of AOM diagnosis. 42 Although tympanometry is recommended by some guidelines, it is not employed in routine clinical practice at any of the TARGet Kids! sites. Tympanocentesis is therapeutic and can prevent subsequent AOM episodes 41 so it cannot be used in this trial of AOM prevention (and it requires instruments not present in primary care sites). Four of the five previous trials of xylitol for the prevention of AOM employed clinical signs with tympanometry, and one used clinical signs to determine the number of AOM episodes. 32 Previous RCTs of AOM management in young children have relied on the diagnoses made by primary care providers (who are generally the clinicians who diagnose AOM for clinical purposes). 43 44 The studies, involving longer study periods, used chart reviews to determine the number of AOM episodes just as we will in this trial (Appendix 1). 44 We have conducted a chart review of 1,637 patients in the TARGet Kids! research network using a method similar to those in completed RCTs of AOM that involves reviewing charts for physical examination findings consistent with AOM and a diagnosis or assessment of AOM. 45 43 44 In all of the episodes, the physical examination findings and the diagnosis were clearly documented in the chart (the term \"AOM\" was usually recorded in the assessment portion of the note), and there was perfect agreement between independent reviewers.",

A challenge in all trials that employ AOM as an outcome is the combined effect of two factors: (1) parents often decide not to seek care when a child has symptoms that may indicate AOM and (2) parents cannot distinguish between AOM and other URTIs because the symptoms are similar. We will address this challenge with our secondary outcome: parent-reported URTIs, a very common and costly (in aggregate) condition in early childhood. 17 48 The previous shorter (2 to 3 month) trials of xylitol found a non-significant trend towards fewer URTI episodes in children receiving xylitol. 32 A cohort study of children aged 2 months to 12 years receiving care at Toronto primary care sites found that medical consultation was sought in only 56% of episodes of URTI symptoms. 49 This is not surprising given that guidelines recommend against antibiotics for AOM and other URTIs in many cases. As many parents are aware of this recommendation from previous clinic visits, they may decide to treat children with analgesics and antipyretics without seeking care even if they believe the child has an AOM. 50 Thus, information about the total number of URTI episodes must be obtained directly from parents and caregivers as it will not be found in a patient's medical record even if it includes records from all institutions and clinics. Parents may not diagnose AOM accurately based on symptoms because they overlap substantially with symptoms of URTIs. 51 Irritability and crying are the most common symptoms in AOM and URTI episodes. 52 Forty percent of children with AOM do not have an earache and 31% do not have a fever, 51 while 72% of children without AOM exhibit symptoms of AOM (crying, fever or ear ache). 52 Like previous studies, we will employ structured telephone interviews to assess the number of URTI episodes. 53 54 55 Parents or caregivers will be contacted every month and asked to report the number of URTIs the child has experienced since the last call (or since the beginning of the trial for the first call) using validated questions (Appendix 1). 55 We will employ the symptoms in the Canadian Acute Respiratory Illness and Flu (CARIF) scale that has been validated in this population. 56 The secondary outcome, parent-reported dental caries, will also be assessed during the monthly phone calls. Parents or caregivers will be asked if they have been informed by a dentist or a physician that their child has or has had at least one or more dental caries (Appendix 1). This question has been used and validated in several epidemiological studies. 57 58 59 60 The dental caries secondary outcome will be binary (at least one versus none). Those with caries at baseline will be excluded from this analysis but included in all other analyses.",

Since the data currently available suggest that the AOM rate is about 1.6 episodes per patient-year, we will somewhat conservatively assume a control event rate of 1.5. We will aim to detect a relative risk of 0.8 (i.e. relative risk reduction of 20%) with 80% power and alpha = 0.05 (two-sided). A 20% RRR was chosen based on previous surveys of reasons physicians do not currently recommend xylitol and the RRR used in previous trials. 32 37 The sample size calculations assumed a Poisson distribution for the number of AOM episodes and were based on the asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio test statistic. Calculations were performed in R (2.15.3) using the asypow package and power was confirmed via 10,000 simulations. The required sample size is 236 per group. (Note that while the number of participants is less than one of the previous trials 63 , the mean treatment and follow-up period in our study will be longer.) The above calculations take into consideration non-compliance and a loss to follow-up of 10% of participants only completing 50% of the follow-up period. These calculations assume there will be no substantial contamination. While xylitol preparations are commercially available, the dose of xylitol is less than one-tenth the dose found in trials to be effective at preventing AOM. A survey of TARGet Kids! participants showed that xylitol use is rare (< 5%). Siblings of those already enrolled in the trial will be excluded since contamination would be likely if two members of the family are enrolled and allocated to different arms.",
