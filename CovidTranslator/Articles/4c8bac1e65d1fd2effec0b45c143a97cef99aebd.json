Adults report between two and four colds a year and children between six and eight colds a year. 1 The median incubation period depends on the virus but is usually between 1 and 6 days. 2 The severity of symptoms typically peaks 3 to 3 days after symptom onset. 1 It is almost always a self-limiting illness, and the total symptom duration is between 7 and 14 days. 3 Historical estimates put the total cost of the common cold in the USA as high as $40 billion per year. 4 This includes both healthcare resource use and work productivity losses, the latter approaching $25 billion. 5 About one half of common colds are caused by human rhinovirus (HRV), 3 6 although in autumn, HRV may account for 80% of all upper respiratory tract infections. 6 HRV is strongly associated with exacerbations of asthma in both children and adults and causes more severe and long-lasting symptoms in these patient groups. 7 Respiratory viruses, including HRV, are found in 40% of exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 8 strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba This is the first study investigating the use of rhinothermy delivered via high flow nasal cannulae for the treatment of the common cold. \u25ba This open-label, randomised controlled feasibility study shows that a randomised controlled trial of rhinothermy compared with low-dose vitamin C in the treatment of the common cold is feasible. \u25ba A 5-unit change in modified Jackson score has been estimated to represent the threshold for substantial clinical benefit. \u25ba Although this study suggested a benefit from rhinothermy, this finding should be considered with caution, as this was a feasibility study in which efficacy was not the primary outcome measure. \u25ba A robust adequately powered RCT is needed, particularly as this feasibility study identified that rhinothermy improved symptoms of the common cold compared with control.",

            "text": "Treatment for the common cold is supportive and symptomatic. About two-thirds of those with a cold use 'over the counter' products. 4 Treatments that have not shown benefit in the treatment of the common cold include: echinacea, antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, antivirals and antibiotics. 3 9-12 Regular supplementation with vitamin C has a small effect on cold duration, but therapeutic supplementation once symptoms develop lacks evidence of efficacy, 13 and it is unlikely that supplementation with low-dose vitamin C once symptomatic will reduce symptom severity or duration. There is no effective HRV vaccine, in part because of the high sequence variability in the antigenic sites of the 150 distinct HRV serotypes. 14 Steam inhalation for symptom relief is a traditional remedy for the common cold. There is a scientific rationale for this treatment because HRV is a temperature-sensitive virus with temperature-dependent reduction in viral replication between 33\u00b0C and 43\u00b0C in vitro. [15] [16] [17] [18] Host defence may also be enhanced at higher temperatures through mechanisms, such as greater production and responsiveness to interferon, 19 20 and enhanced antiviral immune responses mediated by heat shock proteins. 15 Clinical studies of the efficacy of heated humidified air delivered at high flow to the upper airways (rhinothermy) report inconsistent results. 16 21-25 Study limitations include variable, and likely ineffective, methods of delivering heated humid air at high flow to the upper airways. These methods include delivery through nozzles held a distance away from the nares and vented anaesthetic masks. The reported intervention durations were also variable. A Cochrane Review assessed that the current evidence could not support or refute effectiveness and recommended that there is a need for robustly designed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the effectiveness of rhinothermy to treat the common cold. 21 We have reported a tolerability study that found that a high flow nasal cannula device (myAIRVO 2, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Auckland, New Zealand) modified to deliver high flow humidified air at 41\u00b0C via wide bore nasal cannulae was well tolerated in healthy volunteers. 26 The potential advantage of this device for rhinothermy is that it can deliver a consistent temperature, humidity and flow rate direct into the upper airways. The study reported here is a feasibility study of rhinothermy in the treatment of the common cold that will inform the design of a robust RCT of this treatment. The specific aims of the feasibility study were to: 1. estimate the proportions of potential participants after screening who undergo randomisation, and who then complete the study, in turn providing an estimate of the time and resources required to undertake an RCT; 2. estimate the SD of the proposed primary outcome variable for the RCT, the modified Jackson score, [27] [28] [29] so that the sample size for the RCT can be better estimated;",

A sample size of at least 25 has acceptable precision to estimate a SD based on a \u03c7 2 distribution; 3. estimate the minimum clinically important difference in Jackson score. This would require a minimum of 25 participants for precision (based on a t statistic). The recruitment and completion rates CIs were estimated by the Clopper-Pearson exact method. Mixed linear models with an exponential-in-time covariance matrix were used to estimate the differences in modified Jackson scores by treatment and time. A post hoc interaction term tested if the response in modified Jackson score differed by whether the nasal swab results was positive or not. The CI for the SD for the change from baseline modified Jackson score was estimated using a \u03c7 2 distribution. Logistic regression was used to estimate the receiver operating characteristic curves for the probability of participants first saying they were a lot better compared with the change in baseline modified Jackson score at that particular time. The times of measurement were chosen so that about half of participants reported they had improved by that time point. Individual sensitivities and specificities were calculated for change from baseline modified Jackson score of between \u22127 and \u22124 at these times.",

Finally, the small sample size means that although this study found benefits for the new treatment, the results are relatively 'fragile', in that the modified Jackson score would only need to change in a small number of participants who received the rhinothermy intervention to match the control group for our conclusions to be different. 33 34 A formal fragility index cannot be calculated for the change in modified Jackson score as it is not a dichotomous variable. The complete follow-up of all participants helps protect against this fragility; however, due to the above limitations a larger replication study is required. The development of the myAIRVO 2 device with the capacity to deliver 100% humidified air at 41\u00b0C at high flow direct to the upper airways through wide bore nasal cannulae presented the opportunity to investigate the efficacy of rhinothermy again, after a lack of RCTs for over 20 years. The pragmatic regimen used in this study was based on available in vitro and in vivo studies. A temperature of 41\u00b0C was used as although there is a dose dependent reduction in HRV replication up to temperatures of 43\u00b0C-45\u00b0C, 15 16 temperatures of around 43\u00b0C are prone to cause minor mucosal burns. 16 Two-hour sessions were used due to the evidence that the shortest duration of inhibition of HRV replication is observed with 30 min rather than 60 min of hyperthermia in vitro. 16 Repeat sessions were administered over 5 days, as in vitro the effect of hyperthermia is transient, with HRV yields from hyperthermic treated cells reaching baseline levels within 24-48 hours. 15 This rhinothermy regimen was well tolerated. Participants reported it was comfortable and easy to use and apply, although somewhat noisy. These are similar to observations made in our earlier tolerability of the myAIRVO device in healthy volunteers. 26 In the current study, participants used the myAIRVO 2 device for 2 hours per day on average throughout the 5-day treatment period and for 2.6 hours on the days of use. As instructed, not all participants used the device late in the treatment course once their symptoms had improved. Around a third of participants reduced the flow rate to 25 L/min or 30 L/min suggesting that giving participants the option of reducing the flow from the initial 35 L/min, or having a lower starting flow, is worthwhile.",
