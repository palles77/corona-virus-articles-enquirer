In this report, recombinant AIK-C measles vaccines, expressing the RSV G or F protein of subgroup A (MVAIK/RSV/G or F), were investigated as a RSV vaccine candidate. MVAIK/RSV/G or F had the original ts phenotype and expressed RSV/G or F protein. Cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against RSV subgroups A and B were detected in cotton rats immunized intramuscularly with MVAIK/RSV/F but not MVAIK/RSV/G. In cotton rats infected with RSV, RSV was recovered and lung histopathological finding was compatible with interstitial pneumonia, demonstrating thickening of alveolar walls and infiltration of mononuclear cells. When cotton rats immunized with MVAIK/RSV/F were challenged with homologous RSV subgroup A, no infectious RSV was recovered and very mild inflammation was noted without RSV antigen expression. When they were challenged with subgroup B, protective efficacy decreased. When cotton rats immunized with MVAIK/RSV/G were challenged with RSV subgroup A, low levels of infectious virus were recovered from lung. When challenged with subgroup B, no protective effects was demonstrated, demonstrating large amounts of RSV antigen in bronchial-epithelial cells. MVAIK/RSV/F is promising candidate and protective effects should be confirmed in monkey model.",

            "text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae in the order Mononegavirales. The Paramyxoviridae consist of two subfamilies, Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae [1] . Classified into the genus Pneumovirus, RSV is characterized by a non-segmented, negative sense, single-stranded RNA genome, and has approximately 15,200 nucleotides. All members of the paramyxovirus family are similar in structure and characteristics [2] . Viral particles of RSV are surrounded by a lipid bilayer with two viral glycoproteins, G and F [1] , involved in the attachment to, fusion with, and entry into cells during infection. G protein is not always required for infection and cell fusion and the expression of F protein alone leads to cell fusion [3] . RSV was first isolated in 1956 and two antigenically different subgroups, A and B, co-circulate [4] . RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory infections in infants and young children worldwide, and is responsible for a variety of illnesses, including 20-25% of pneumonia cases and 45-50% of bronchiolitis cases among hospitalized children [5] . The peak of serious RSV infections is at 2-6 months of age and most children experience an RSV infection by two years of age [6] . The infection causes serious illnesses especially in babies born prematurely and having chronic lung diseases, or congenital heart diseases. RSV also causes lower respiratory tract infections in the elderly, and in immunocompromised hosts [7] . The global annual morbidity and mortality for RSV are estimated to be 64 million and 160,000 deaths, respectively [8] .",

            "text": "A recent study of the immune response to RSV showed the importance of innate immunity in regulating adaptive immune responses [9] . Adaptive immunity is generally considered effective due to neutralizing antibodies (NT) and cellular immune responses for the clearance of viruses are influenced by innate inflammatory responses. Secretory and NT antibodies were generated after repeated infections with RSV, although the responses were weak in young infants [10] . The presence of IgG antibodies in the lung has been shown to reduce viral load [11] . Even a natural infection did not provide long-term protective immunity against reinfection in young infants, and a humanized monoclonal antibody against the F protein is available as a prophylaxis against RSV, or for reducing serious diseases in high-risk infants during epidemics [12] . However, the high medical costs for monthly administration mean that there is a great need to develop an RSV vaccine [13] . There are several obstacles to developing a RSV vaccine. An aluminium-precipitated formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine (FI-RSV) was developed in the 1960's, but did not prevent infections [14] . In fact, symptoms were exacerbated among recipients subsequently infected with RSV. FI-RSV generated only binding antibodies without neutralizing activity because of the denatured F protein, and did not induce cytotoxic T cell lymphocytes (CTL) activity [15] . Several strategies have been adopted to develop subunit vaccines, live attenuated vaccines through conventional methods of cloning or selecting ts mutants, genetically modified-strain by reverse genetics, and vaccinia virus vector-based recombinant vaccines [16] [17] [18] .",

            "text": "RSV is a clinically important cause of respiratory tract infections, especially among high-risk infants, immunocompromised hosts, and the elderly. Despite a serious disease burden, there is no licensed vaccine for RSV. Initial efforts to develop a vaccine involved FI-RSV which unexpectedly enhanced the disease in clinical trials in RSV-naive children [33] . FI-RSV failed to induce a secretory IgA response after pareteral administration without inducing a CTL response, which was a serious drawback of the inactivated vaccine. The defeated F protein would not induce Th1 response and the aluminium-precipitated vaccine induced only Th2 response. The allergic reaction to this vaccine would be caused by the Th2prone reaction [34] . Several subunit vaccines were investigated, but failed to generate effective antibodies. A live attenuated vaccine has the advantage of inducing humoral and cellular immune responses similar to a natural infection. Temperature-sensitive (ts) and cold-adapted (ca) RSV vaccine strains have been developed by conventional attenuation methods. Over the last 40 years, cautious and deliberate progress has been made toward developing a RSV vaccine using various experimental approaches, including live attenuated strains and vector-based and viral protein subunit vaccine candidates. But the balance between the safety and immunogenicity is a key issue to the development of a live attenuated vaccine, and the (ts) RSV vaccine candidate resulted in insufficient attenuation, causing similar respiratory illness [35] . Based on a vaccine candidate having the ts phenotype, several recombinant vaccine candidates were developed by deletion of the SH gene or NS1 gene or mutation by reverse genetics. These recombinant RSV vaccines induced sufficient immune response in chimpanzees [36] . Another approach involved the application of reverse genetics to express RSV protein in a recombinant vectorbased vaccine. The first vector-based candidate was evaluated using vaccinia virus. Recombinants expressing RSV F or G was highly immunogenic, induced protection in mouse but provided inconsistent protection in chimpanzees [37] . MVA strain of vaccinia-based recombinants expressing RSV G and F protein were immunogenic in rodent but not in rhesus monkey model [38] . Several vectorbased live vaccine platforms were established using HPIV-III and Sendai virus [23, 39] . Through preceding experiments, the F protein is known to be more effective than G. But there were no experiences for clinical usage and the HPIV-III-based recombinant vaccine was poorly immunogenic in human clinical trials.",

The same was observed after immunization with MVAIK/RSV/G or F. To investigate the viral growth, samples of nasal turbinate, lung, thymus, spleen, liver, kidney, and bone marrow were obtained 10 days after immunization, but no infectious virus was recovered. Total RNA was extracted and RT-real time PCR was performed to detect the measles N gene by real-time PCR. The MV genome was detected only in thymus in cotton rats immunized with MVAIK, MVAIK/RSV/G, and MVAIK/RSV/F (data not shown). Infectious virus was recovered from inguinal superficial lymph nodes three days after infection in the previous study [42] . NT antibody titers against RSV were investigated, using RSV Long (subgroup A) and wild-type subgroup B. MVAIK/RSV/G or MVAIK/RSV/F induced the production of NT antibodies against RSV subgroup A from one week after vaccination in cotton rats. Antibody titers were higher after immunization with MVAIK/RSV/F than with MVAIK/RSV/G. RSV has distinctly different subgroups, A and B. The G or F gene of subgroup A was used in this study. Therefore, the cross reaction of NT against subgroup B was investigated. MVAIK/RSV/G did not generate NT antibodies against RSV subgroup B, but MVAIK/RSV/F induced production of cross-reactive NT antibodies against RSV subgroups A and B. The predicted amino acid sequence of the RSV F protein used in this study exhibited 98.6% homology among F proteins of subgroup A strains and 90.8% in comparison with those of subgroup B strains. The predicted amino acid sequence of RSV G protein has 86.9% homology among subgroup A strains but 49.7% in comparison with subgroup B. Thus, F protein was relatively conserved between subgroups A and B but the G protein of RSV was variable and thought not suitable as a vaccine antigen. Recently, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the RSV F protein was used for prevention of serious RSV infections in young infants having cardiac and pulmonary disorders, with a low birth weight, or born prematurely. In this study, recombinant MVAIK/RSV/G or F was administered intramuscularly and induced sufficient NT antibodies. Secretory IgA antibodies and CTL response were not examined but it protected against the challenge with homologous RSV subgroup A. In non-immunized cotton rats, 10 5.4 and 10 4.5 PFU of infectious virus were recovered from 20 mg of lung tissue four days after the RSV challenge. But those immunized with MVAIK/RSV/F were protected, without recovery of infectious virus from the lung tissues. And they did not demonstrate interstitial pneumonia. Cross reactive NT antibodies were demonstrated after immunization with MVAIK/RSV/F but its protective effect is not sufficient against subgroup B, demonstrating slightly lower levels (approximately 1/10 of non-immunized control) of the recovery of infectious virus. Protective effects of MVAIK/RSV/G were poor in comparison with MVAIK/RSV/F similar to the serological responses.",

The recombinant AIK-C viral cDNAs expressing RSV G or F protein were constructed based on AIK-C cDNA (pMVAIK). pMVAIK/20-77 was constructed for the cloning of foreign genes. The Asc I site was introduced by adding GGCGCG after position 3432 of AIK-C and R1 and R2 sequences were added. The Nco I-Not I fragment of RSV G or F was cloned into pMVAIK/20-77, designed as pMVAIK/20-77/RSV. pMVAIK/20-77/RSV had unique restriction enzyme sites, Sac II and Pac I sites, located in the P gene and between the F and H gene. The DNA fragments between the Sac II and Pac I sites of pMVAIK/20-77/RSV/G and pMVAIK/20-77/RSV/F were inserted into pMVAIK using Sac II and Pac I sites. The recombinant plasmid constructs were designated pMVAIK/RSV/G and pMVAIK/RSV/F, respectively.",
