Continuous variables (mainly laboratory values) tended to have skewed distributions; thus we used medians rather than means. A conditional logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the variables that are independently associated with MERS-CoV infection. The magnitude of association, presented as the odds ratio and 95% CI was also determined this way. All reported P values in this article are also based on the logistic regression.",

By comparing our cohort of MERS-CoV patients to another cohort of 47 patients diagnosed with MERS-CoV between September 2012 and June of 2013 described by Assiri et al. [21] we can notice that both cohorts were predominated by male sex (60% vs 77%), though ours had a lower male proportion. Male predominance, which was observed in almost every surveillance study [17,19e21] could be related to the culture in Saudi Arabia, where women wear veils that cover both the nose and mouth and may help protect from exposure, along with decreased outdoor activities compared to men. Our patients' median age was 40 years compared to a median age in the range of 50e59 in the previous cohort. Fever (59% vs 98%), cough (53% vs 83%), and shortness of breath (38% vs 72%) were the main symptoms, though our patients were less likely to be symptomatic. We also noticed that our patients were less likely to have co morbid conditions (46% vs 96%), less likely to have chest-X-ray abnormalities (51% vs. 100%) and had a significantly lower mortality (10% vs 60%).

This might also imply that the true burden of the disease in the kingdom is still uncovered and that we might be just seeing the tip of the iceberg. This theory was first brought up after a nationwide, crosssectional, serological study done between December 1st 2012 and December 1st 2013 in which serum samples from just over ten thousand individuals, whom age and sex distribution largely matched the general population [26] .",
