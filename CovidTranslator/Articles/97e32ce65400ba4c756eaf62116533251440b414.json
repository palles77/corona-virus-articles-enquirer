The most common viral LRTIs among young children are acute bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Acute bronchiolitis is characterized by tachypnea, wheezing, suprasternal or intercostal retraction, sometimes cyanosis or apnea, and even respiratory failure. 1 As a virus-predominant disease, the most common acute bronchiolitis pathogen is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), causing more than 50% of cases. Other respiratory pathogens include the influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus (ADV), rhinovirus, and enterovirus. 2 Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (hBoV), and human coronavirus NL-63 (hCoV NL-63) are three of the novel viruses resulting in similar symptoms to RSV, including acute wheezing episodes. 3, 4 Their incidences among children with LRTI vary between 1.5e17.5%, 5 1.5e11.3%, 6 and 1.3e9.3%, 7, 8 respectively. Detection of these viruses relies on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in reference laboratories.",

The occurrence of dual infection is a risk factor of greater disease severity. 10 Evidence also showed that severe viral infection in infancy or early childhood is related to recurrent wheezing and asthma in later life, especially RSV and hMPV infections. 11 This study explores the epidemiology of viral LRTIs in young children, including single and mixed infections.

            "text": "As in the previous literature, RSV is always the leading pathogen of acute bronchiolitis. The isolation rate varies with different study designs and geographic areas. Mlinaric-Galinovic et al. 18 reported that RSV was responsible for 49% of 1,010 hospitalized Croatian infants with LRTI and younger than 6 months old over an 11-year period. In the study of Miron et al. 2 in Israel, 490 previously healthy babies younger than 24 months hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis during 4 winter months were enrolled. RSV was identified in 76% of children. Midulla et al. 19 found RSV in 41.2% of 182 Italian infants with acute bronchiolitis in three consecutive annual epidemic periods. In our study, RSV was the most frequently detected virus, presented in 41.7% of all patients. RSV in Taiwan circulates year-round and peaks mainly in spring and fall with annual variation. 20 Thus, if we enrolled patients over 12 months the incidence of RSV may change. hMPV isolation has been reported around the world since 2001, 21, 22 with various prevalence from 1.5% to 17.5% in children hospitalized with acute respiratory illness. However, hMPV-positive patients accounted for up to 27.1% in our study, which may be related to N gene use with higher sensitivity in hMPV detection. Regarding the difference between RSV and hMPV, Chan et al. reported that RSVinfected children at a younger age lead to longer hospital stays and higher oxygen demand than hMPV did. 23 On the other hand, Viazov reported that the clinical characters of RSV and hMPV bronchiolitis showed no significant difference, except the duration of symptoms was shorter in hMPVinfected patients. 24 Mullins' data showed similar disease severity in RSV and hMPV-infected children. 25 No significant difference was found in hospital stay or fever duration, severity score, white blood cell counts, C-reactive protein, or complication rate in our study, similar to Carraciolo's report. 26 However, RSV-positive patients showed a trend for longer duration of O 2 demand (p Z 0.053). The discrepancy among these studies may result from the great heterogenecity in studied populations (age group, diagnosis, and inpatient/outpatient). To differentiate these two viruses judging by clinical information is difficult. Therefore, further researches with large sample sizes and detailed subgroup analyses are necessary.",
