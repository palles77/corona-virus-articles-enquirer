            "text": "Human Apolipoprotein D (apoD) is upregulated under several stress conditions and pathological situations such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancers. We previously showed that apoD mRNA expression is induced in growth-arrested cells and demonstrated the specific binding of nuclear proteins to the region \u2212514 to \u2212475 of the promoter. Such region contains a pair of Serum Responsive Elements (SRE), an Ets-Binding Site (EBS) and a Glucocorticoid Responsive Element (GRE). In this study, we show that Parp-1, HnRNP-U, CBF-A, BUB-3, Kif4, APEX-1 and Ifi204 bind these regulatory elements of the apoD promoter. Specific binding of HnRNP-U and Parp-1 was confirmed by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA). In a biotin pull-down assay, Kif4 and BUB-3 bind preferentially the SRE1 and the EBS-GRE sites, respectively, while APEX-1 seems recruited indirectly to these elements. We found that the mRNA expression of some of these binding factors is upregulated in growth-arrested cells and that these proteins also transactivate the apoD promoter. In agreement with these results, mutants of APEX-1 and of Parp-1 defective for their DNA-binding and catalytic activities could not transactivate the promoter. The knockdown of Parp-1 and HnRNP-U and the use of specific inhibitors of MEK1/2 and of Parp-1 also inhibited the induction of apoD gene expression. Moreover, ERK1/2 was found activated in a biphasic manner post serum-starvation and the inhibition of Parp-1 causes a sustained activation of ERK2 but not ERK1 for up to 2 h. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the importance of Parp-1, APEX-1 and ERK1/2 catalytic activities in the growth arrest-induced apoD gene expression. j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w. e l s ev i e r. c o m / l o c a t e / b b a m c r",

            "text": "In human, the apoD gene is expressed at high levels in the adrenal glands, spleen, testes, lungs, pancreas, kidneys and the nervous system [10] . ApoD expression is also found increased in several neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, meningoencephalitis, dementia, motor neuron disease [11] , Parkinson's disease [12] , schizophrenia [13, 14] , multiple sclerosis [15] and several animal models of neurodegenerative injuries [10] . Besides neuropathological situations, apoD expression is elevated in several cancers. This overexpression of apoD gene is observed particularly in differentiated tumours with low proliferation rate and several studies suggested the importance of cellular growth arrest as a triggering factor of apoD expression [16] [17] [18] . Effectively, in cultured cells, apoD expression is associated with cellular growth arrest, senescence and inflammation. In agreement with these facts, apoD is also upregulated in aging rats [19] and humans [20, 21] and this senescence characteristic, which is an irreversible growtharrested state in contrary to quiescence, is also considered as a physiological mechanism capable of counteracting tumour proliferation [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

More precisely, we found that the Alternating Purine-Pyrimidine stretch (APP) and two Serum Responsive Elements (SRE-1 and -2) were the major determinants of growth arrest-induced apoD gene expression. The SRE is a 23-bp element with an inverted repeat of dyad symmetry [29] . Only the SRE1 of the apoD promoter contains a CArG-box core described as a 10-bp element with the consensus sequence CC(A/T) 6 GG. In many growth-related or immediate early genes, the CArG-box element is often in the vicinity of an Ets-Binding-Site (EBS) [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Detailed analysis of the apoD promoter also revealed the presence of an EBS and a Glucocorticoid Responsive Element (GRE) between the two SREs in the region \u2212514 to \u2212475 [28] . The EBS, with its central core sequence 5'-GGA(A/T)-3', is known to cooperate tightly with the SRE through the binding of several nuclear proteins, particularly the Serum Response Factor (SRF) and members of the E26 transforming specific (ETS) family which regulate several genes implicated in cell proliferation and differentiation [33, 34] . Also, the GRE is known to interact with the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR), a nuclear receptor ligand-dependant transcription factor which recognizes the consensus sequence 5'-GGTACAnnnTGTTCT-3' [35] .",

Here, we present the identification and the characterization of several nuclear proteins that bind the apoD promoter under normal and growth arrest conditions in NIH/3T3 fibroblast cells. Our results show that Parp-1, HnRNP-U, CBF-A, BUB-3, Kif4, APEX-1 and Ifi204 bind elements of the promoter. We also investigated the implication of MEK/ERK pathway in the regulation of the apoD gene expression. We demonstrate the implication of these nuclear factors in the modulation of the apoD promoter and that Parp-1, APEX-1 and ERK1/2 catalytic activities regulate positively the apoD gene expression in growth arrested-cells.",

The corresponding bands in the negative controls were also analyzed in order to eliminate false-negatives. Several nuclear proteins were identified by correlating the mass of their tryptic peptides with the theoric values found in NCBInr database through the Mascot server (www.matrixscience.com) and listed in Fig. 1B . Five of these proteins were known to interact directly or indirectly with regulatory elements in the promoter of several genes and to modulate their expression, notably, Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (HnRNP)-U [37] and HnRNP-A/B also known as CArG-box Binding Factor A (CBF-A) [38, 39] , Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (Parp-1) [40] , Interferon-inducible protein 204 (Ifi204) [41] and Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Endonuclease-1 (APEX-1) [42, 43] . Kinesin family member 4 (Kif4) and Budding Uninhibited by Benzimidazole (BUB)-3 were also considered because of their role in cellular proliferation and their interaction with Parp-1 [44, 45] . As shown in Fig. 1A , CBF-A, BUB-3 and APEX-1 were purified in both normal and growth arrest conditions. In growth conditions, the two known isoforms of CBF-A (p37 & p42) [46] were co-purified (lane 1; bands 5 and 7) in contrast to growth arrest conditions where only the p42 isoform was purified (lane 3; band 6). HnRNP-U, Parp-1 (band 2), Ifi204 (band 3), Septin 9 and Kinesin family member C1 (KifC1) (band 4) were exclusively present in growth arrest conditions while Kif4 (band 1) only in normal growth conditions.

As expected, apoD mRNA expression was significantly induced in serum starvation conditions (Fig. 3) . Expression levels of Parp-1 were also induced by 2.1-fold after 1 day of serum starvation and reached a peak at day 2 with a 3-fold induction to finally decrease until day 5. This induction was even stronger by Northern analysis (up to 9 fold at day 2). Ifi204 and APEX-1 were also induced after 2 days of serum starvation by respectively 2.8 and 1.8 fold.

These cysteines are known to be implicated in the redox activity of APEX-1 which modifies and modulates the activity of several transcription factors [47] . Lysines 6 and 7, located in the nuclear localization signal motif (NLS) and known to be acetylated by p300 were replaced by arginine (K6R/K7R). This double mutation abrogates the redox activity of APEX-1 without affecting its nuclear localization [48] . Finally, aspartic acid 218 which is known to be important for the endouclease and DNA-binding activities [49] was replaced by alanine (D218A). As shown in Fig. 4A , all these mutants were unable to transactivate the apoD promoter in growth arrest conditions in contrast with the wild type APEX-1. Interestingly, mutants C64A/C92A and K6R/K7R induced the proliferation of NIH/ 3T3 cells cultured in condition of serum starvation compare to the wild-type APEX-1 or the control (CTRL\u2212; empty vector) where the cells were maintained in a growth arrest state (Supplemental Fig.1 ). In addition, the Parp-1 deletion mutant lacking its catalytic domain (del-Parp-1) could no longer transactivate the apoD promoter indicating the importance of the catalytic function in the apoD promoter regulation. Furthermore, we tested the role of Parp-1 and HnRNP-U on the apoD expression using a siRNA approach. The predesigned siRNAs used to block either HnRNP-U or Parp-1 inhibited their target gene expression by more than 80% up to 4 days under growth arrest (grey bars; Fig. 4B ) and efficiently and specifically blocked apoD expression (grey bars; Fig. 4C ). Biotin pull-down assay using different probes in which sequence of specific regulatory element was mutated or deleted as indicated ( Table 1 ).

This inhibitor blocks the binding of NAD + to the catalytic domain of Parp-1. This binding is crucial for the transfer of ADP-ribose unit on nuclear proteins mediated by Parp-1 [50] . As expected, the inhibition of Parp-1 catalytic activity with 3-ABA at 10 mM completely abolished the stimulating effect of Parp-1 on the apoD gene expression in growth-arrested cells (Fig. 5A) . This result was consistent with those obtained with the deletional mutant del-Parp-1 transfection experiment and the siRNA assay ( Fig. 4A and C) .",

Interestingly, the inhibition of MEK1/2, which phosphorylate ERK1/2, significantly reduced the apoD gene expression under growth arrest conditions (Fig. 5B) . Complete inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in presence of U0126 was verified by western blot analysis (results not shown). Consistent with this result, upregulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 was detected as early as 5 min after serum starvation without inhibitor, reached a peak at 15 min and decreased after 30 min (Fig. 5C) . Surprisingly, at 24 h post serum starvation, ERK1/2 were again phosphorylated. Moreover, in the presence of Parp-1 inhibitor, activation of ERK2, but not ERK1, is maintained after 15 min for up to 2 h (Fig. 5D ). Subsequently, ERK2 phosphorylation was completely inhibited after 2 h in the presence of Parp-1 inhibitor which is consistent with the apoD gene downregulation observed in Fig. 5A and B.",

Using a biotinylated oligonucleotide containing the SRE1, EBS and GRE elements of the apoD promoter, we were able to purify and identify several nuclear proteins by mass spectrometry analysis. Among these proteins, HnRNP-U and CBF-A (Fig.1A) , which belong to the Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleo-protein family, are also known to interact with elements in the promoter of several genes and to regulate their expression. Indeed, HnRNP-U is known as a transcriptional activator of Kruppel-like factor 2 gene [54] and of Osteopontine gene expression, which is also modulated by CBF-A [37] . CBF-A is also involved in the regulation of the Ha-ras gene expression [39] . The mRNA binding ability of these two proteins led us to speculate that they could be recruited at the promoter level and play a role in both the apoD mRNA expression and processing, in this context of growth arrest. All these different crucial roles of HnRNP-U may explain its ubiquitous gene expression profile in growth-arrested NIH/3T3 cells (Fig. 3) . Binding of HnRNP-U to the promoter was further demonstrated by EMSA ( Fig. 2A) . The addition of HnRNP-U antibodies specifically reduced the complex intensity. This interaction with the SRE1-EBS-GRE, whether direct or indirect, is in agreement with previous reports showing that HnRNP-U can play a role in gene regulation via its interaction with the GRE site located in the promoter of the tryptophan oxygenase gene [55] and therefore suggests that HnRNP-U might interact with the apoD promoter through the GRE binding site.",

Kif4 is a member of the kinesin superfamily of proteins known to transport cargos of macromolecules along the microtubules of cells, such as membrane organelles, protein complexes and mRNAs [44, 62] .

In addition, Kif4 can repress Parp-1 enzymatic activity in the nucleus of NIH/3T3 cells in normal culture conditions [44] . Thus, the apoD gene expression could be modulated by the interaction of these two proteins. In our study, Parp-1 could not be purified in normal growth conditions suggesting that the possible interaction of Parp-1 and Kif4 in NIH/3T3 cells, reported by Midorikawa and collaborators [44] , may inhibit Parp-1 binding on the apoD promoter. Therefore, the presence of Parp-1 on the apoD promoter in growth arrest conditions may be favored by both the down-and upregulation in gene expression of Kif4 and Parp-1, respectively (Fig. 3) .",

            "text": "In contrast, APEX-1 binds the promoter but binding persists despite the mutations of each consensus sequence (Fig. 2B) . However, the deletion of the SRE1 abolished the binding. This implies that APEX-1 probably binds the apoD promoter through a greater affinity for the mutated sequences or through the interaction with other proteins, such as Parp-1, that bind either the SRE1 or the EBS-GRE sites. APEX-1 is a multifunctional protein implicated in DNA repair through the base-excision repair (BER) pathway, where Parp-1 was also shown to be involved but more importantly, APEX-1 is well known for its role in transcription regulation through a redox activity. Indeed, the redox activity of APE1 was shown to modify and activate several stressinducible transcription factors such as AP-1, NF-\u03baB, p53, Egr-1, CREB, ATF and HIF-1\u03b1 [47, 63] . The fact that APEX-1 gene expression was found induced in growth arrest conditions may also indicate its importance in such stress conditions (Fig. 1B) . Also, APEX-1 was shown to be induced in several stresses such as oxidative conditions, cancers [47] and several neurodegenerative disorders [63] . It is interesting to note that such stresses including H 2 O 2 and UV induce apoD gene expression as well as the catalytic activity of Parp-1 [27, 64, 65] . Therefore, it would be of interest to investigate if Parp-1 and APEX-1 also modulate the apoD gene expression under these conditions and will definitely clarify the mechanism of regulation of the gene. Indeed, apoD is considered as a stress protein, and we demonstrated that it plays a protective effect for neurons of mice treated with paraquat [65] . A similar protection against oxidative stress was observed in Drosophila and plants [65, 66] . Protection was also observed in mice infected with OC43, a coronavirus that induces brain inflammation and neurodegeneration [64] . and D218A) and the plasmid pRSV\u03b2GAL. After transfection, cells were cultured in media with (10%; white bars) or without serum (0.5%; grey bars) for 2 days. The luciferase activity was analyzed and normalized by the \u03b2-Galactosidase activity. The empty pcDNA 3.1 expression vector was used as control. The asterisks indicate statistically significant results (N = 9, *P b 0.05, **P b 0.01, ***P b 0.001). Del-Parp-1 corresponds to the protein lacking its C-terminal end and its enzymatic activity. (B) NIH-3T3 cells were transiently transfected with siRNA directed against HnRNP-U and Parp-1 and exposed to serum-starved conditions for 4 days. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed by RT-PCR using specific primers for the HnRNP-U, Parp-1 gene and HPRT as control. (C) ApoD mRNA expression analyzed by RT-PCR in NIH-3T3 cells exposed to serum starved conditions for 4 days after siRNA suppression of HnRNP-U and Parp-1 genes. As negative controls, transfections with non-specific siRNA (siRNA NS) or without siRNA (\u2212siRNA) were used.",

Their inhibition totally abolished the apoD gene induction under serum starvation conditions (Fig. 4C) . Moreover, we further demonstrated the importance of Parp-1 and APEX-1catalytic activities in the induction of apoD gene expression in growth-arrested cells. These results were observed either by deleting the C-terminal portion containing the catalytic domain of Parp-1 (Fig. 4A ) or by inhibiting its catalytic activity with a specific inhibitor 3-ABA (Fig. 5A) . For APEX-1, both its redox and DNA-binding activities were necessary to transactivate the apoD promoter and we demonstrate a link between APEX-1 redox activity and the cell cycle regulation since inhibition of APEX-1 activity promotes cell proliferation under serum starvation (Supplemental Fig. 1 ).

This is surprising since ERK1/2 activation is essential for cell cycle progression from G1to S-phase by downregulating several antiproliferative genes [71, 72] . However, ERK1, but not ERK2, expression in fibroblasts inhibits oncogenic Ras-mediated proliferation, colony formation as well as tumor production in nude mice [73] . More importantly, the B-Raf isoforms can induce cell-cycle arrest in NIH/3T3 cells [74] . In this study, we showed biphasic ERK1/2 activation in time in growth-arrested NIH/ 3T3 cells, reaching a peak at 15 min, decreasing after 30 min and activated again 24 h later (Fig 5C) . In addition, ERK2 remains phosphorylated for up to 2 h in the presence of Parp-1 inhibitor which blocks apoD expression (Fig. 5D ). This result implies that ERK1/2 activation is necessary for apoD gene induction. This regulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in growth arrest conditions could be mediated by Parp-1 activity. Further investigations are necessary to verify if ERK1/2 are effectively ADP-(ribosyl)ated in stress conditions and also to determine if ERK1/2 kinase activity is directly involved in the regulation of the nuclear factors identified herein.",

Our results also highlight the implication of the MEK/ERK pathway in the apoD regulation, itself modulated by Parp-1 catalytic activity. They demonstrate a central role played by Parp-1 and APEX-1, both through their binding to the apoD promoter and their catalytic activity during this process.",
