Early identification of causative bacterial and viral pathogens is important to enable prompt and appropriate treatment and thereby prevent life-threatening clinical outcomes. Patients with suspected meningitis are generally prescribed antibiotics before hospital admission or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection for examination. However, the admin-istration of antibiotics may render it difficult to culture the causative bacteria, thereby impairing microbiological diagnosis [1, 2] . To counter this problem, alternative methods of molecular identification, including 16S/23S rRNA gene amplification followed by sequencing and real-time PCR, have been developed. However, the clinical application of such techniques is limited because of the presence of interfering bacterial or viral DNA, timeconsuming nature of these assays, and small number of detection channels available on the real-time PCR platform [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

Bacterial meningitis was differentiated from viral or aseptic meningitis by a WBC count of more than 100 cells/mm 3 with neutrophil dominance and a ratio of CSF glucose/serum glucose level of less than 0.4. Cases with insignificant WBC count or discrepant results in different parameters were classified into the undetermined group. The median patient age was 27 yr (range, 1 month to 72 yr). For the verification study, we tested only the 78 samples collected at the time of diagnosis, i.e., before antibiotic therapy was initiated. Another set of 118 samples was used to assess discrepancies in positive results obtained from the same patients. Samples that were blood-colored, showed leakage, were aged over 12 hr, and strongly suspected of being contaminated (with discrepancies in the pathogens detected in consecutive tests), were excluded.

Conventional diagnostic tools, including CSF staining, culture, and antigen analysis, have limited diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. This has prompted the development of several molecular methods employing conventional, real-time, or multiplex PCR. Although previously developed multiplex PCR methods can rapidly identify up to 9 bacterial and viral agents, the Seeplex Meningitis ACE detection kit, which employs a DPO method, can identify the 12 most common bacterial and viral agents that cause meningitis: SP, HI, NM, GBS, LM, CMV, HEV, EBV, HSV-1, HSV-2, HHV-6, and VZV. DPOs, which consist of 2 separate priming regions joined by a polydeoxyinosine linker, yield 2 primer segments with distinct annealing properties. The long 5\u2032-segment initiates stable priming, whereas the short 3\u2032-segment controls target-specific extension; the use of these 2 primer segments effectively eliminates non-specific priming and yields consistently high PCR specificity even under less-than-optimal PCR conditions [13] . This method is highly appropriate for the identification and differentiation of viral and bacterial pathogens with very variable genetic characteristics and low availability of primer sites. Several multiplex PCR kits using the DPO technology have been developed to identify common viral and bacterial pathogens causing respiratory infections and diarrhea, and such kits are currently being used in clinical laboratories [14] [15] [16] .",

Six CSF samples were simultaneously positive for 2 pathogens, suggesting co-infection or contamination rather than false-positivity, because subsequent sequencing of PCR products yielded 98-100% matches with sequences in the BLAST database. Of the 12 pathogens assayed, HEV had the highest prevalence and was detected in 23 samples by the Seeplex Meningitis ACE Detection kit. Of the bacterial strains, SP was the most frequently detected; SP was detected in 5 samples, although it was detected along with viruses, including HEV, HSV-1, and VZV, in 4 samples.",

These discrepancies were perhaps attributable to inter-specimen differences at varying stages of infection. Of the other 29 patients who tested negative for all pathogens, 10 had indeterminate CSF parameters, whereas 19 showed findings consistent with bacterial or viral infection. The presence of clinical features of meningitis and indeterminate CSF findings in the 10 patients may be attributed to conditions other than acute viral or bacterial meningitis. In contrast, meningitis in the 19 patients with CSF findings consistent with bacterial or viral infections may have been caused by pathogens other than the 12 assayed by the Seeplex Meningitis ACE Detection kit. Alternatively, the concentration of pathogens in the CSF may have been too low to permit detection.",
