The diagnosis was acute reactivation of chronic hepatitis B. Treatment with lamivudine (100 mg daily) was started. He remained clinically stable with biochemical improvement until day 4, when he developed a fever of 39\u00b0C. No focal source of infection was found and his chest radiograph was normal. Despite empirical intravenous cefotaxime and levofloxacin, his fever persisted. A chest radiograph on day 7 showed bilateral air space consolidation. His condition deteriorated the next day, involving respiratory failure and shock, and he was admitted to the intensive care unit. By this time it was apparent that he had contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the hospital outbreak of the disease (1, 2) . This was subsequently confirmed when SARScoronavirus (SARS-CoV) was isolated from his nasopharyngeal aspirate. Despite mechanical ventilation and therapeutic intervention that included broad-spectrum antibiotics, ribavirin, and pulse methylprednisolone, his condition worsened and led to multiple system organ dysfunction. The patient died on day 16.",

The patient was improving until he developed symptoms of SARS. With lamivudine treatment and without SARS, he most likely would have recovered (4) . Conversely, his impaired hepatic function might have aggravated the course of SARS and contributed to his death. The interval between the onset of fever and death was much shorter (16 days) than the mean admissionto-death time of 36 days in other SARS patients who had died (2) .",

Peripheral lymphopenia is an important feature in SARS and appeared to have affected the liver even in the face of hepatitis. Interestingly, lymphocyte depletion in this patient is reminiscent of hepatic histology in patients with full blown AIDS (7) . This may reflect the overwhelming effect of SARS on the immune system.
