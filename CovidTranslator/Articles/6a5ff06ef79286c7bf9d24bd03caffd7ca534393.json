All three proteins were released slowly (tllP > 6 hr) from JE-infected monkey cells (Vera cells). Mosquito cell lines released E at a similar rate (tl12 > 8 hr), while NSl and NSl' were retained in an undegraded form in the cell layer. The proteolytic processing of the three proteins appeared identical in both cell types, but some differences in N-linked glycosylation were observed. E, NSl, and NSl' found within the infected cells of both types contained high-mannose oligosaccharide groups for more than 8 hr after synthesis. Additional sugar residues were added to the single E protein oligosaccharide group prior to release from Vero cells, while sugar residues were trimmed from the E protein oligosaccharide group prior to release from mosquito cells. The forms of NSl and NSl'found in the culture fluid of infected Vero cells contained one complex and one highmannose oligosaccharide.",

Taken together, these results suggest that both the structural (E) and nonstructural (NSl and NSl') glycoproteins were accumulated within the secretory pathway of the infected Vero cells, assembled into particles, and then released into the extracellular fluid. o tsss Academic Press, Inc.",

This protein was originally designated the soluble complement-fixing antigen, or SCF, and elicits most of the complement-fixing antibody produced by infected animals (Russell et a/., 1980) . The understanding of this important viral immunogen has been further expanded by demonstration that this protein exists as a dimer that is resistant to reduction and SDS treatment, but not heating (Winkler eta/., 1988) . In addition, endoglycosidase studies have shown that NSl produced in dengue 2-infected hamster cells contains a mixture of high-mannose and complex carbohydrates (Winkler et a/., 1988) and radiolabeling experiments have shown that the NSl protein produced in tick-borne encephalitis virus-infected porcine cells contains mannose, glucosamine, galactose, and fucose (Stephenson et a/., 1987) . Little is known of the function of NSl in viral replication. However, this protein may serve a role in flavivirus assembly which ultrastructural studies have identified as a multistep process that occurs in the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum complex of infected cells of both mammalian (Leary and Blair, 1980; lshak eta/., 1988) and mosquito (Ng, 1987; Hase et al., 1987a,b) origin.",

Results with yellow fever virus (YF) showed that monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for NSl were capable of passively protecting animals from a lethal YF challenge (Schlesinger et a/., 1985; Gould et a/., 1986) . Furthermore, direct immunization of animals with NSl purified from YF-infected cells elicited a protective immune response to YF (Schlesinger et al., 1985) and immunization with NSl purified from dengue type 2-infected cells provided partial protection from challenge with dengue 2 (Schlesinger et a/., 1987) . Although the mechanism of action of both direct immunization and passive protection was unclear, the protected animals showed a postchallenge seroconversion to other viral proteins, indicating that viral replication had taken place (Schlesinger et a/., 1985 (Schlesinger et a/., , 1987 . These findings suggest that a humoral immune response to NSl protected the host by attenuating virus replication, probably by in viva lysis of infected cells. However, the time of NSl appearance on the infected cell surface and the in viva effectiveness of antibody-mediated lysis of infected cells remain unclear.",

(2) NSl and NSl' were only released from vertebrate cells. (3) The proteolytic processing and addition of N-linked oligosaccharides to the viral glycoproteins were similar in both vertebrate and invertebrate cells. (4) NSl and NSl' found in the culture fluid of vertebrate cells were in a particulate form.",

Quantitation of the amount of labeled E protein present in the gel used to prepare the autoradiogram shown in Fig. 2A shows that E was released from C6/36 cells with a t,,2 > 8 hr (Fig. 2C) , a time course similar to the release of E from Vero cells (Fig. 1C) . Interestingly, no forms of NSl or NSl' were found in the culture fluid of JE-infected C6/36 cells (Figs. 2B and 2C) . Rather, NSl and NSl' remained in the cell monolayer and no changes in the relative amounts of radioactivity associated with each of these proteins were detected during the 24-hr chase period (Figs. 2B, C). The absence of NSl and NSl' from the culture fluid obtained from two other mosquito cell lines (Fig. 3) indicated that the inability to release NSl and NSl'was a common feature of mosquito cell lines.",

Furthermore, treatment with tunicamycin appeared to alter the ratio of NSl to NSl' found within the monolayer, possibly reflecting a change in proteolytic processing, or a differential increase in the degradation of the deglycosylated form of NSl relative to the deglycosylated form of NSl'. Tunicamycin treatment resulted in about a 50% reduction in the levels of NS3 present in infected ceils under these conditions (results not shown), suggesting that the dramatic effect on the viral glycoproteins was not a nonspecific protein synthesis effect. The observed differences in molecular mass between the normal glycoprotein forms and the forms produced in the presence of tunicamycin (Fig. 4) suggested the presence of two N-linked oligosaccharide groups on NSl and NSl'and a single group on E, consistent with the cDNA-derived amino acid sequence data for JE (McAda et al., 1987) and endoglycosidase studies described below. The low molecular mass polypeptide (approximately 42 kDa) observed in lanes 3 and 5 of Fig. 4 was probably a degradation product of the E protein produced by the tunicamycin-treated cells. Endoglycosidase treatment was used to analyze the N-linked oligosaccharide groups present on the cellassociated and extracellularforms of E, NSl , and NSl' (Fig. 5) . These studies compared the susceptibility of the different glycoproteins to endo H which is specific for high-mannose carbohydrates (Tarentino et a/., 1978) and PNGase F which cleaves all N-linked carbohydrate groups (Tarentino et al., 1985) . Proteins obtained from tunicamycin-treated Vero cells served as standards for complete deglycosylation (Fig. 5) .",

These results are consistent with the findings of Hsieh and Robbins (1984) that showed that Sindbis virus envelope glycoprotein oligosaccharides that were processed to a complex form in mammalian cells were trimmed to a Man,GlcNAc, glycan in mosquito cells, which are very poor substrates for endo H (Tarentino et al., 1978) .

Furthermore, although JE NSl and NSl'remain at the top of sucrose gradients used to purify the virus particles ( Fig. 6 ) these glycoproteins readily enter 5-20% sucrose gradients (Fig. 7A) . To investigate the possibility that these forms of NSl were associated with membranous particles, the sedimentation properties of NSl and NSl'found in culture fluid were examined in the presence of 1 mg/ml Triton X-l 00 (Fig. 78) . As expected, the addition of Triton X-l 00 dramatically altered the sedimentation of E by releasing it from the virion (Figs. 7A and 7B ). In addition, the distributions of NSl and NSl' were markedly changed (Figs. 7A and 7B), in a manner consistent with their presence in membrane containing vesicles (Helenius and Simons, 1975) . Interestingly, in the presence of Triton X-100 NSl and NSl' co-sedimented, ahead of E, consistent with their presence in dimers or multimers of NSl and NSl' (Fig. 7B) . The existence of SDS resistant, heat labile, dimers of NSl has been reported for dengue 2 (Winkler et a/., 1988) , and similar dimers that contain both NSl and NSl'have been observed in the cell layers and the culture fluids of JE-infected cells (results not shown).",

            "text": "requires cotranslational proteolytic processing. Although the N-termini of E, NS 1, and NS 1' and the C-terminus of E are probably formed by cleavage at signalase sites conserved among the flaviviruses (McAda et a/., 1987; Mason et a/., 1987a) , the proteolytic cleavage sites that produce the C-termini of NS 1 and NS 1' have not been identified. On the time scale of the pulse-chase studies presented here, NSl' was a major viral product, not merely a short-lived intermediate in the production of NSl This result suggests that alternative, rather than sequential, proteolytic cleavages are utilized in this region of the JE polyprotein. Several protease cleavage sites have recently been identified in this region of the Kunjin virus polyprotein by sequencing the N-terminus of the NS2A and NS2B proteins (Speight et al., 1988) . Although homologous cleavage sites can be identified in the deduced JE protein sequence (McAda et a/., 1987) the predicted characteristics of the resulting protein products appear inconsistent with the properties of the JE NSl and NSl'described in this paper. AJE NSl protein with a C-terminus produced by the cleavage site defined by the N-terminus of the Kunjin NS2A protein would consist of 352 amino acid residues (deglycosylated molecular mass of 40 kDa) and would lack any significant linear hydrophobic domains (Adams and Rose, 1985) inconsistent with the observed amphipathic properties of the JE NSl protein. A combined JE NSl -NS2A polypeptide with a C-terminus produced by the cleavage site defined by the N-terminus of the Kunjin NS2B protein would consist of 579 amino acid residues and have an unglycosylated molecular mass of 65 kDa, much larger than the observed size of the enzymatically deglycosylated NSl' protein (determined to be 52 kDa, see under Results). E, NSl, and NSl' acquired N-linked oligosaccharides in both Vero and C6/36 cells, but the processing and release of these glycoproteins was different in mammalian and mosquito cells. The results presented here demonstrate that one N-linked glycosylation site on E and two shared by NSl and NSl' were utilized during glycoprotein synthesis in JE-infected Vero and C6/36 cells, and in both cell types, all three glycoproteins retained high-mannose oligosaccharides long after synthesis. The oligosaccharide present on E synthesized by Vero cells was processed to an endo Hresistant, presumably complex form, immediately prior to release. In contrast, the oligosaccharide present on E released by mosquito cells had been trimmed to a smaller, endo H-resistant form. Vero cells released both NSl and NSl', although NSl was released more rapidly, and in higher amounts. Furthermore, the extracellular forms of NSl and NSl'each contained one oligosaccharide that was processed to a larger, presumably complex form, and one high-mannose oligosaccharide. Surprisingly, no forms of NSl or NSl' were detected in the culture fluid of JE-infected mosquito cells. The inability of mosquito cells to produce com- plex oligosaccharides (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985; Hsieh and Robbins, 1984) may be related to their inability to release NSl and NSl'. In addition, the finding that tunicamycin dramatically reduced the appearance of E in the extracellular fluid and abolished release of NSl and NSl'from JE-infected mammalian cells may be indicative of the importance of N-linked oligosaccharides in the maturation and release of JE glycoproteins. E, NSl, and NSl' were released from JE-infected cells at a very slow rate. The greater than 6-hr time period required for half of the pulse-labeled protein to be released from either mammalian or mosquito cells (Figs. 1 C and 2C) is much longer than the t,,2 = 34 min required for release of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein from infected cells (Strous and Lodish, 1980) . These data provide biochemical evidence for a protracted period of flavivirus glycoprotein synthesis, transport, and/or assembly, consistent with ultrastructural studies (Lear-y and Blair, 1980; Ng, 1987; Hase et a/., 1987a,b; lshak et a/., 1988) and virus synthesis studies (Westaway, 1980) . This slow rate of release suggests that these three JE glycoproteins were specifically retained in the cellular secretory pathway (Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987; Wieland et al., 19871, probably to facilitate virion assembly. Although the exact site(s) of retention of E, NSl, and NSl' within the JE-infected Vero cells were suspended in Triton X-l 14 containing buffers, aqueous and detergent phases were prepared, and viral glycoproteins were immunoprecipitated from equal portions of the aqueous (A) and washed detergent (D) phases, subjected to electrophoresis, and autoradiographed. endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi of the infected cells has not been established, the finding that the cellular forms of these three glycoproteins retained sensitivity to endo H indicated that they were retained in a compartment that preceded the trans-Golgi (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985) . This property of retention within the secretory pathway is shared by several other viral proteins (Madoff and Lenard, 1982; Tooze et al., 1987; Paabo et al., 1987) .",
