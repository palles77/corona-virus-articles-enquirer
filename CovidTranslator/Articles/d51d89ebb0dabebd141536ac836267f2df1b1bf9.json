Hence, it is important to understand the functioning and strategic decisions of these providers of public good resources. 2 The existing literature tends to use case studies of individual collections. This paper uses a unique worldwide survey of microbial collections to analyse the heterogeneity among culture collections, and to empirically assess the economic and institutional conditions that contribute to this heterogeneity with respect to conservation choice and associated industry spillovers. Results suggest that in the short run publicprivate partnerships may indeed support knowledge accumulation with particularly strong public good properties. It is important to be aware of this strong tie, in order to steer also the long term conservation patrimony into one that offers not only short term usability but also resilience to future unforeseen needs e.g. of emerging crop plagues.",

Much scholarly research on these new organisational and institutional mechanisms for providing public access to basic knowledge resources in the life sciences has focused on human genetics and plant breeding (Harvey and McMeekin, 2007; Overwalle, 2009 ). This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of these changes by focusing on a case study within the particular field of microbiology. The reason for this choice is double. First, the international network of public culture collections historically has been one of the first global research infrastructures providing public access to basic biological research materials (Stern, 2004; Reichman et al., 2013) , held in a distributed network of collections throughout the world (Smith, 2003) . Second, the importance of these public collections has grown over the last two decades, with their transformation to multi-service biological resources centres, which provide expertise in genetics and bioinformatics, in addition to their traditional taxonomic expertise (OECD, 2001) . As a result, the network of public microbial collections has increasingly evolved from purely governmental institutions to a heterogeneous group encompassing both public sector and private sector funding strategies. Therefore, culture collections is an interesting case of a research infrastructure providing publicly available knowledge assets, whose organisational structure is increasingly based on public-private economic interdependencies (please refer to the electronic supplement for additional background to PSMCs).",

However, two important features are specific to the microbial collections. First, microbial organisms have an extremely high genetic variation within species and very high mutation rates upon reproduction. As a result, there is no equivalent to the relatively well-defined species concept for plants and animals. Therefore microbial science depends on the in vitro organisms held in the microbial ex situ collections. This explains the importance of a broad range of wild biodiversity held and still massively collected by the microbial collections, while the ex situ conservation efforts in the agricultural plant and animal collections that have been the focus of previous studies the main focus is on domesticated varieties and breeds (Halewood, 2010) Second, the public microbial collections provide on average a comparable amount of materials to public sector and private sector entities in the life sciences. This hybrid character of the distribution practices of the public microbial collections makes this case a rich source for quantitative analysis of conservation and distribution strategies in life science research infrastructures.",

In particular the paper aims to analyse core aspects of the economic and institutional conditions that contribute to PSMCs' conservation of microbial material and its distribution as publicly available basic knowledge assets for life science research. It is expected that this analysis will contribute to the design of strategies that secure the sustained long term conservation of microbial material with public good properties. This seems especially relevant in the context of uncertainty created by recent changes in the institutional landscape in which PSMCs operate, for instance due to the stress on public funding for basic research and infrastructures, and the increasing commercial interest by the industry in microbial resources generally.",

We find that (1) the private industry relies on PSMCs; (2) hybrid arrangements based on complementary public and commercial funding is associated with stronger specialisation in microorganisms with particularly strong public good properties and (3) the existence of public-private interdependency. These results call into question the role of markets alone or pure public funding alone for assuring the provision of publicly available biological resources in a globalised research context. The next section addresses the key factors behind the organisational heterogeneity of PSMCs. Then the analytic framework discusses the factors that are expected to play a role in the public and private investment in the PSMCs' conservation strategies regarding publicly available microbial type strains. We also introduce the related question about spillovers from PSMCs to the private industry (Section 3). Section 4 presents the materials and methodology of the statistical analysis; Section 5 presents the results and discusses their implications. The last section concludes.",

For instance, market oriented policy planners in the USA and elsewhere have realised the opportunity to diminish time laps between basic research findings and commercialised products (Rai, 1999; Bartsev, Pers. Comm.) . This has come timely because financial pressure among PSMC have mounted under rapidly accumulating stocks of microbes, while governments' finances are undergoing increasing stress (Baker, 2004) : a major challenge is associated with the high costs that are incurred in the conservation, quality management and documentation of microbial strains. For instance it is estimated that one million USD are needed for creating a new collection of about five thousand strains, excluding the costs of long term maintenance and use (Baker, 2004) . In this context, the income generated by the selling of microbial strains is an important source of income that complements other non-governmental sources of income, including contract research, identification services, and, where this applies, income from patent and safety deposits as found in this paper (see Section 3). Hence, new conditions have been created for private cost sharing of public collections (Furman and Stern, 2006) .",

The difference in such strategies largely owe to collections's scale, type of operations, and the underlying incentives that guide their operations and strategic choices. In this context, it is useful to differentiate the collections regarding their different functions for society, such as support for basic research or infrastructure, and their industry orientation. Table 1 provides examples illustrating the heterogeneity among well-known collections in this regard, further explained in the Almus and Nerlinger, 1999; Arora et al., 2005; Daniel and Prasad, 2010; Greene, 2003; Parry, 2004; Rai et al., 2008; Sigler, 2004 ; electronic supplement. The heterogeneity of PSMCs has implications for the level of public funding support required for their operations. Collections essentially oriented towards serving traditional public sector users are largely dependent on public funding. In contrast, collections holding resources that are of direct interest to specialised activities in the private sector, have more opportunities for developing supplementary commercial income generating activities. Nevertheless virtually all collections require a certain level of public support for maintaining public access to their infrastructure and research related microbial holdings.",

TS are important building blocks for knowledge accumulation since they constitute the reference library against which any new microbial species has to be compared in order to certify their novelty, hence being a particularly vital tool for knowledge accumulation. While typically TS holdings are important in taxonomic collections which specialise in building a reference library, research collections also need a basic stock of TS as part of their overall holdings (c.f. Table 2 ). Further, while some collections were created with the explicit aim of having many TS (Smith, Pers. Comm.) , researchers often prefer to deposit their TS in other high profile research oriented collections, which do not specialise only in TS, as it gives prestige and higher diffusion for the researcher.",

TS consist of both the biological resource and of well documented information about their properties, such as reactivity with cancer cells. Hence, TS can be regarded as a hybrid material/ informational good, with public good characteristics associated both to the material itself and to the informational content. As biological resources, TS hold properties that are similar to those of a public good, since TS are characterised by relatively low rivalry in use since a similar strain can be cultivated from the original strain. 5 The information content of TS is of course non rival in the sense that usage does not reduce the information content. While their biological component is characterised by relatively low cost of exclusion since access is conditioned on consent from the holder of the TS, such as a PSMC, the information content related to the properties of TS has very low exclusion. That is, in order to achieve a broad diffusion and to capture coordination benefits, information content of TS is placed in the public domain, such as in scientific journals and PSMCs' internet portals. Since TS are used to enhance search for useful properties in other microbes, broad diffusion of the information content of TS is central to knowledge accumulation.

For example, in Europe the broader dissemination (and thus lower rivalry in use) of TS is reflected by the fact that identical copies of a given TS can be found in up to eight collections, while identical copies of non-TS are held in only 1.2 collections on average (Personal communication, June 2007, Peter Dawyndt; analysis done with the Straininfo Bioportal software for a subset of the major international culture collections).",

Table 1 ) will to a certain extent invest in TS but will also develop a broader portfolio of biological materials. In this case a more diversified funding strategy will be required. For such research collections, moderate support from the government and the private sector for TS conservation is expected to be important as well.

Combining their basic research and infrastructure functions with the promotion of downstream applications, by providing services to industry, seems like trying to square the circle. However, this combination of basic research perspectives and user-inspired applications is precisely what has characterised the recent history of the contemporary life sciences more generally (Cook-Deegan and Dedeurwaerdere, 2006) , where for example new insights in genomics have contributed to our basic understanding of biological processes while at the same time leading to new applications in genetic diagnostics and rational drug design. 6 Producing knowledge in this intermediary field implies looking beyond the norms and practices of basic science and taxonomic communities, and requires support for building new collaborations that cross the boundaries between basic science, conservation and commercial and non-commercial user communities. This latter situation characterises both the infrastructure oriented and the specialised industry collections (cf. Table 1 ). In contrast, in the case of basic research oriented collections, where private sector users have lesser incentive to contribute to its public infrastructure functions, a certain level of public support is required to maintain these functions. Our complementary question is therefore if and to what extent low public investment, as measured by low as opposed to high public funding, is correlated with the PSMC's industry orientation in terms of the proportion of microorganisms supplied to industry as opposed to other users.",

This indicates a role of private funding in the provision of TS. However, this is a nonlinear effect. The data suggest that it is a mix of publicprivate funding strategy that characterises those collections that may prioritise investment in TS. This result is consistent with previous conclusions from crop breeding analyses (Gollin et al., 2000; Visser et al., 2000) . In line with public good theory as well as search theory, society relies on public investment for the provision of diversity of biological research materials that otherwise would be underprovided by markets alone.

Regarding the control variables, strong property rights (the variable PR) has a statistically significant and positive effect on conservation outcomes, suggesting that a more formal approach to the acquisition and distribution of microbes, i.e. with a formal legal mechanism to control the use of the resource, is associated with a higher ratio of TS in collections' holdings.

Additionally, we can see that a formal transfer mode by charging a fee is associated with specialisation in TS. To the extent that TS are public goods, as argued here, this result indicates that more business like ways of handling research materials have gained a strong influence in public good microbe holdings.

The same outcomes are shown for low public funding. The remaining funding variables do not have statistically significant effects. This reflects a diversified funding strategy for industry oriented collections. Specifically, such outcome indicates that a strong public service mandate, as reflected by heavy public funding, is associated with an orientation towards other users than the private industry. Notably, even if all PSMCs to some extent belong to the basic research infrastructure, at least half of the PSMCs in the dataset receive also private funding. Such costsharing appears to play an important role in conservation because it is associated with both large collections, and collections which specialise in TS. Among the control variables, property rights are not statistically significant. This may indicate that the use of MTAs is in no way exclusive for provision to industry but are in fact used also for provision to other users. As expected, the scale or size of the collection (the variable STOCK) and sourcing of microbes (the variable INFLOW) foremost included for the conservation regression have no meaningful statistically significant effect on the industry orientation. However, the variable denoting a higher relative provision of microbes to academia and hospitals (the variable FLOWACAD) is statistically significant and indicates that industry in contrast to other sectors have structurally different preferences and needs. For instance, it is not necessarily the case that whichever high demand for microbes from a PSMC, irrespective of the type of demander, signals that the collection also attracts demand from industry. Rather, more traditional users such as academia and hospitals may have different preferences than industry, related to issues such as institutional arrangements regarding microbe transfers or the content and quality of microbes and associated information.",

Based on a unique world-wide survey of culture collections the paper provides novel insights about the way that public-service microbial collections constitute a highly heterogeneous group of organisations, how the evolving funding mechanisms relate to their conservation of publicly available microbial resources, and to the distribution patterns of microbial resources to private sector and public sector recipients. Moreover, in order to cast further light on the important question of private influence on public goods, microorganisms with particularly strong public good properties are contrasted to other microorganisms. The results highlight an interesting link between public good specialisation and (a) private funding and (b) distribution to industry. The picture that emerges from the analysis in this paper of the heterogeneity amongst the culture collections is that differences in organisational -especially related to funding mechanisms -and contractual mechanisms -especially related to the conditions of transfer of materials -is beneficial for creating the kind of organisational diversity which is needed to sustain the culture collections' activities in various different micro-economic and institutional contexts. This in turn is necessary in order to address the challenge of creating sufficient storage space for the wealth of microbes being deposited in the PSMCs on a daily basis. In addition, the analysis shows that the heterogeneity allows accommodating the private sectors' specific interest in and support for the conservation and distribution of certain subsets of microbial resources, such as the microbial type strains analysed in this paper, in a manner that is compatible with the core mission of the PSMCs to guarantee the broad public availability of its microbial holdings.",
