Three hundred and twenty-four samples which were found to be negative for influenza virus after screening with real-time RT-PCR and cell-based culture techniques demonstrated the potential for viral infection with evident cytopathic effect (CPE) in several cell lines. Objective: To assess whether whole genome next-generation sequencing (WG-NGS) together with conventional molecular assays can be used to reveal the etiology of influenza negative, but CPE positive specimens. Study design: The supernatant of these CPE positive cell cultures were grouped in 32 pools containing 2-26 supernatants per pool. Three WG-NGS runs were performed on these supernatant pools. Sequence reads were used to identify positive pools containing viral pathogens. Individual samples in the positive pools were confirmed by qRT-PCR, RT-PCR, PCR and Sanger sequencing from the CPE culture and original clinical specimens.",

However, the identification of pathogens in the samples that yielded low sequence reads requires additional testing and controls. Our data (Tables 1A and 1B) showed total sequence reads without subtracting background sequence of the negative control experiment. The low sequence reads in several samples were likely generated from combination of cross talk among neighboring sequenced samples, contamination of barcodes and carries over from the previous runs. A specific example such as the Philippines 2012 pool contained sequence reads that were identical to Philippines 2011-2012 pool, which was performed next to each other during library preparation.

Due to limitation of the study, a subset of the samples (2.9%) was selected for sequencing individually and the identity of the pathogens from sequence individually is in agreement of the results from the pooled samples. With the addition of WG-NGS, 29 of 32 (90.6%) pools were shown to contain viral pathogens identifiable using the GENBANK nt database. When broken down into individual samples, we were able to confirm the presence of other respiratory viruses in 100 of the 310 (32.3%) individual samples. WG-NGS significantly increased valid data information in addition to the standard respiratory assays. Furthermore, the WG-NGS and bioinformatics analysis were able to identify viral pathogens from pooled cultures containing up to 26 samples, which potentially makes this method time, labor and cost effective. This procedure allows screening of larger numbers of samples, with practical applications to surveillance or clinical studies. However, the sensitivity of detection of this procedure may have some limitations [27] . Mainly pooled CPE positive cultures were tested as opposed to individually sequencing primary specimens. Without taking into consideration samples where HSV-1 was detected, approximately 67.8% of the samples in the pooled remained of unknown etiology after WG-NGS and bioinformatics data analysis (Fig. 4) . A potential and likely significant limitation in this work was the cell lines selected for virus isolation. Our limitation to our two cell lines may have curtailed the type of viruses we were able to isolate and identify. Moreover, antibiotics required to maintain the MDCK and HEp-2 cultures may have also favored the growth of certain viruses over others.",

The WG-NGS does not require predefined target for identification of specific pathogens based on clinical presentation. In addition, the WG-NGS broadens the array, magnitude and complexity of pathogen detection since it is not limited by pathogen-specific primer and probe sequences. There are no requirements for the WG-NGS to update primer and probe sequences and the use of culture to isolate continuously. However, the technology provides complex results which require careful sample preparation, powerful sequencers, exhaustiveness of data analysis on well-planned bioinformatics pipelines and large databases for pathogen identification.",
