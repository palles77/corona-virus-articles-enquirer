While varicella is likely spread as cell-free virus to susceptible hosts, the virus is transmitted by cell-to-cell spread in the body and in vitro. Since VZV glycoprotein E (gE) is essential for virus infection, we postulated that gE binds to a cellular receptor. We found that insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) interacts with gE through its extracellular domain. Downregulation of IDE by siRNA, or blocking of IDE with antibody, with soluble IDE protein extracted from liver, or with bacitracin inhibited VZV infection. Cell-to-cell spread of virus was also impaired by blocking IDE. Transfection of cell lines impaired for VZV infection with a plasmid expressing human IDE resulted in increased entry and enhanced infection with cell-free and cell-associated virus. These studies indicate that IDE is a cellular receptor for both cell-free and cellassociated VZV.",

VZV is a member of the a-herpesvirus family and is closely related to the other two human virus members of the family, herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2. Acute infection with VZV is followed by cell-associated viremia and the rash of varicella (Arvin, 2001) . The virus establishes latency in the nervous system and can reactivate to cause zoster. While varicella is likely transmitted by cell-free airborne virions, in cell culture VZV is highly cell associated, and the virus is propagated by cell-to-cell spread with no infectious virus present in the medium. The virus is thought to spread within the body by cell-to-cell transfer of virus.",

Mannose 6-phosphate inhibits infection with cell-free VZV, which implicates the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR ci ) in facilitating entry of cell-free virus by interacting with viral glycoproteins that contain phosphorylated N-linked complex oligosaccharides (Gabel et al., 1989; Zhu et al., 1995) . Chen et al. (2004) used stable cell lines deficient in MPR ci to show that the protein is required for infection by cell-free VZV (Chen et al., 2004) . However, soluble MPR ci did not bind to viral glycoproteins in ligandblotting assays (Zhu et al., 1995) . Cell lines deficient in MPR ci are not impaired for infection by cell-associated virus; thus, MPR ci is not a cellular receptor for cell-to-cell spread of the virus.",

            "text": "VZV encodes at least seven glycoproteins, gB, gC, gE, gH, gI, gK, gL, all of which have well-conserved homologs in HSV (Cohen and Straus, 2001) . In contrast to HSV, VZV does not have a homolog for gD. While HSV gD is one of five glycoproteins in the unique short region of its genome, the corresponding portion of VZV encodes only two VZV glycoproteins, gE and its chaperon gI. Since HSV gD is the receptor binding protein for HSV, and VZV gI is not required for infection by VZV (Cohen and Nguyen, 1997) , VZV gE might be important for binding to a cellular receptor. HSV gE or HSV gD alone do not mediate membrane fusion. The minimum requirement for HSV fusion to cells is the coexpression of four glycoproteins (gD, gB, gH, and gL) and a cell-surface entry receptor specific for gD (Pertel et al., 2001) . Syncytia formation in VZV, a hallmark of cell-to-cell spread, is due to fusion of cell membranes mediated by gH and gL, or gB and gE (Cole and Grose, 2003) . While expression of gH or gB alone induce a modest amount of fusion, expression of gE alone is not sufficient for fusion unless it is coexpressed with gB (Maresova et al., 2001) . Attempts to generate a VZV gE deletion mutant were unsuccessful (Mo et al., 2002) , and a gE minus virus could only be constructed using cells expressing gE (Q.L. and J.C., unpublished data). Taken together, these findings indicate that VZV gE is an essential glycoprotein for VZV. Antibodies to gE neutralize virus in vitro, and immunization with a vector expressing gE protects animals from challenge with virus (Lowry et al., 1992; Wu and Forghani, 1997) . Therefore, VZV gE may be involved in viral entry and cell-to-cell spread and is a likely candidate for binding to a cellular receptor.",

Lysates from VZV-infected cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to VZV gE, gB, or gH and immunoblotted with anti-IDE antibody. While gE coimmunoprecipitated with IDE, gB and gH did not interact with IDE ( Figure 1C , lanes 7-9). Transfection of CV-1 cells with plasmids expressing VZV gE, VZV gI, or HSV gE followed by immunoprecipitation with the corresponding antibody and immunoblotting with anti-IDE antibody showed that the extracellular domain of VZV gI, which functions as a gE chaperone but lacks sequence homology with gE, also interacted with IDE, although at a much weaker level than gE ( Figure 1C , lanes 1 and 2). This was confirmed using an ELISA-based ligand binding assay. When similar levels of His-tagged soluble gE, gI, or gB were incubated with HA-IDE, the latter bound significantly greater to gE than to either gB or gI over a range of concentrations ( Figure 1D ). HSV gE, which has 32% amino acid identity with VZV gE within a 170 amino acid region, interacted very weakly with IDE ( Figure 1C , lane 4).",

Human fibroblasts (MRC-5 cells) that are susceptible to productive VZV infection were transfected with two independent pools of IDE-specific siRNAs (siRNA-IDE1, siRNA-IDE2) or two independent control siRNA pools (siRNA-1, siRNA-2). At 2.5 days after transfection, half of the cells were harvested for immunoblotting to determine the level of IDE, and the remainder of the cells was infected with cell-free ROka-lacZ. IDE-specific siRNA knocked down the IDE level by about 95% compared with control siRNAs, as calculated by densitometry ( Figure 4A ). To determine the effect of IDE knockdown on VZV infection, the cells infected with cell-free ROka-lacZ were stained with X-gal 4 days later. VZV infectivity in the cells transfected with IDE-specific siRNA was reduced by about 70% compared with the cells transfected with control siRNA ( Figure 4B ). Interestingly, most of the X-gal positive foci in the cells transfected with IDE-specific siRNA consisted of only single isolated blue cells ( Figure 4C , panels 3 and 4); in contrast, larger foci involving multiple cells, due to cell-to-cell spread of virus, were (B) Monolayers of CV-1/EBNA-1 cells were biotinylated for 30 min at room temperature in PBS to label cell-surface proteins.

In addition to insulin, glucagon, insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), atrial natriuretic peptide, transforming growth factor-a, and b-amyloid protein are substrates for IDE (Duckworth and Kitabchi, 1974; Farris et al., 2003; Hamel et al., 1997; Misbin and Almira, 1989; Muller et al., 1991) . Several other proteins, including epidermal growth factor and IGF-I, bind to IDE but are not hydrolyzed by the enzyme (Duckworth et al., 1998) . It has been hypothesized that these IDE ligands possess common conformational motifs for binding to IDE (Kurochkin, 1998) .",

            "text": "Several other human viruses also use enzymes as receptors, notably human coronavirus 229E, which uses aminopeptidase N (CD13), and human SARS-associated coronavirus, which uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Aminopeptidase N and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 are, like IDE, members of the zinc metalloprotease family (Delmas et al., 1992; Li et al., 2003) . Interestingly, VZV as well as the two coronaviruses use enzymes as receptors, independent of the activity of the enzyme. Although IDE is predominately a cytosolic protein, it is also present on the plasma membrane (Goldfine et al., 1984; Kuo et al., 1993; Yaso et al., 1987) . It localizes to apical or basolateral regions in different tissues (Kuo et al., 1993) . A novel isoform of IDE is associated with the surface of differentiated, but not undifferentiated, neurons (Vekrellis et al., 2000) . This suggests that IDE may have a role in VZV infection of neurons. IDE is also found in endosomes (Duckworth et al., 1998; Hamel et al., 1991) . HSV has recently been shown to enter certain cells by endocytosis in a pH-dependent pathway (Nicola et al., 2003) . If VZV is endocytosed in certain cells like HSV, then IDE might allow VZV in endosomes to penetrate into the cytosol. The tissue distribution of IDE is ubiquitous (Kuo et al., 1993) , which correlates well with the broad tissue tropism of VZV, especially in vivo.",

Chen et al. (2004) demonstrated that MPR ci is important for cell-free, but not cell-associated, VZV infection. In contrast, IDE functions as a receptor for both cell-free and cell-associated virus. IDE and MPR ci share some common features. Both molecules interact with some of the same ligands, including IGF-I, IGF-II, and epidermal growth factor (Kuo et al., 1993) . At the subcellular level, IDE and MPR ci both localize abundantly in endosomes, a compartment important for VZV trafficking and maturation (Hambleton et al., 2004) . Therefore, IDE and MPR ci might interact with each other to facilitate virus infection. Chen et al. (2004) showed that virus maturation was altered in MPR ci -deficient cells, and cell-free virions were released into the medium in cell culture. In contrast, we did not detect a difference in virus maturation by electron microscopy after treatment with an IDE inhibitor ( Figure S2 ), and inhibition of IDE did not result in release of detectable cell-free infectious virus into the cell-culture media (Q.L. and J.C., unpublished data).",

A similar limit on the maximum degree of inhibitory efficiency has been seen with other viruses that use more than one receptor (Akula et al., 2002; Cocchi et al., 1998; Shukla et al., 1999) . Second, expression of exogenous human IDE in nonhuman cells rendered them more susceptible to VZV infectivity than to virus binding.
