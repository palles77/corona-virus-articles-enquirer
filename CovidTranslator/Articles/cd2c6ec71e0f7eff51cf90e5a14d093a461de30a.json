We show that, in equilibrium, whether the public firm engages in innovation more aggressively than the private firm depends on the degree of spillovers. Moreover, firms' equilibrium locations exhibit neither maximal nor minimal differentiation. Finally, privatization could reduce social welfare because it may generate inefficient location and insufficient R&D investment. This suggests that a mixed duopoly could be socially preferable to a private duopoly in the presence of endogenous R&D spillovers.",

            "text": "Organization (WHO) called upon 11 laboratories in 9 countries to join a collaborative research project on SARS diagnosis. 2 Since then, public institutes of many countries spent a broad effort to develop vaccines and drugs against the SARS virus. Private firms, not certain whether the market will be long lasting, first hesitated to invest in SARS research. 3 Later on, attracted by government funding and expectation of shortrun profit, they switched some of their focus to the infectious disease. 4, 5 This example highlights the possibility of public firms being more willing to spend on R&D, in the presence of positive externalities. 6 As a result, privatization of public firms could result in a lower level of R&D, thus leading to a welfare loss. 7 This paper develops a model where a public firm competes against a private firm in a linear market. 8 Firms may engage in product R&D to improve the quality of their products. The R&D undertaken by one firm benefits its rival through spillover. 9 The spillover benefit is negatively associated with the distance between the two firms. The purpose of this paper is three-fold. First, we investigate how technology spillover affects firms' incentive to innovate. Second, we study where firms locate their plants in the presence of R&D spillover. Our final goal is to examine the welfare implication of privatization of the public firm.",

However, the reverse could be true if the spillover is small. To maximize social welfare, the public firm has a stronger incentive to engage in innovation when the R&D spillover is high. On the contrary, to maximize its own profit, the private firm has a lower incentive to conduct R&D, for the following reasons: First, R&D expenditure is a typical cost to the investor. Second, a greater spillover reduces the private firm's R&D incentive. And finally, tougher competition induced by R&D rivalry is harmful for improving firms' profits.",

            "text": "The second result derived from our analysis is that firms choose inside locations. The distance between the two firms depends crucially on parameter values. The final result is that privatization of the public firm may not benefit the whole society because it could generate inefficient location and insufficient R&D investment. 2 http://www.who.int/csr/sars/project/en/. 3 http://cmbi.bjmu.edu.cn/news/0305/19.htm. 4 http://65.199.186.23/nbt/journal/v21/n7/full/nbt0703-720a.html. 5 Another example is R&D competition around the \"genome project\" between national institutes and private firms (Ishibashi and Matsumura 2006) . The project is started by the US government in 1986 and followed by international cooperation in 1990s. Public institutes have played essential roles in accelerating the research progress and prevented private firms' monopoly use of the outcomes of investigation. 6 Oehmke (2001) compares R&D activity by public sectors and that by private sectors. He finds that universities are active in R&D in plant biotechnology for important but smaller markets in which private firms have little interest. 7 With respect to innovative effort, Munari (2002) finds that pubic ownership is preferred to private ownership. Munari and Sobrero (2005) obtains a similar result. 8 In the real world, firms often produce differentiated products. For example, firms could develop various antiviral drugs to identify, treat, and prevent SARS. The Hotelling-type approach allows us to model product selection explicitly, that is, the distance between the two firms can be thought as the degree of product differentiation. 9 This assumption is used to capture the positive externalities mentioned in the examples. The paper is thus closely related to the literature that deals with R&D competition. Since the writings of Schumpeter, there exists an increasing interest in exploring the relationship between the structure of an industry and R&D activity in the industry. 10 In a mixed oligopoly, Nishimori and Ogawa (2002) , Ishibashi and Matsumura (2006) show that public firms engage in R&D more aggressively than private firms. 11 However, these papers do not consider spatial competition, which is a focus of the present paper. Matsumura and Matsushima (2004) use a Hotelling model and find that a public firm engages in R&D less aggressively than a private firm. However, they neglect R&D spillover between firms, which is another focus of this paper. Recent evidences indicate that R&D spillover plays an important role in firms' location decisions (e.g., Head et al. 1995; Audretsch and Feldman 1996; Rosenthal and Strange 2001) ; thus, it is important to theoretically investigate how R&D spillover affects firms' locational choices.",

            "text": "The present paper is also closely related to the literature that analyzes the validity of Hotelling's principle of minimum differentiation. First, D' Aspremont et al. (1979) , Neven (1985) argue that firm location exhibits maximal rather than minimal differentiation. Second, Economides (1986) shows that maximal differentiation holds only if transportation cost functions are highly convex. 12 Finally, Tabuchi (1998) , Mai and Peng (1999) , Zhou and Vertinsky (2001) show that both maximal and minimal differentiation can be equilibrium outcome. 13 However, these studies do not consider R&D. Due to the importance of research and development (Howells 2008) , it is worth integrating R&D into the spatial competition model. 14 This paper is also closely related to the literature that deals with welfare implications-with and without privatization of public firms. Cremer et al. (1991) show that a mixed duopoly is socially preferable to a private duopoly. Anderson et al. (1997) argue that, in the short run, privatization is harmful because prices rise, but in the long run, the net effect is beneficial if consumer preference for variety is high enough. Matsumura and Matsushima (2004) demonstrate that privatization can mitigate the loss arising from excessive cost-reducing investment by the private firm and thus lead to a welfare gain. 15 10 See, the pioneering contribution on R&D competition, for example, Loury (1979) , Dasgupta and Stiglitz (1980) , Katz (1986) , D'Aspremont and Jacquemin (1988), Dixit (1988) , Rosen (1991) , Kamien et al. (1992) , Suzumura (1992) , Suetens (2005) . However, these papers overlook spatial competition between firms. 11 Cato (2008) extends Nishimori and Ogawa's (2002) model to the case where there is R&D spillover. 12 Irmen and Thisse (1998) , Tabuchi (1994) argue that when firms compete in a multi-characteristics space, firms maximize differentiation in the dominant characteristic but minimize differentiation in the others, making Hottelling's belief almost right. In a mixed oligopoly model, Matsushima and Matsumura (2003) show that private firms always agglomerate at the same point. 13 Some studies find similar results under different circumstances (Pal and Sarkar 2002; Brekke and Straume 2004; Liang and Mai 2006) . 14 Some papers focus on firms' location choice in private oligopoly models. By adding an R&D process into a product-variety model, Harter (1993) finds various types of equilibria, as the costs of R&D are varied. By using a model with R&D and spillovers, Piga and Poyago-Theotoky (2005) show that firm locations depend crucially on transportation cost (the extent of product differentiation).",

Proposition 2 states that firms choose to locate at endpoints rather than at interior points of the market, which is different from the observation by PP. In our and PP's model, there are two opposite effects that influence equilibrium locations, that is, the competition effect and the spillover effect. In the present model, R&D decision is made in the first stage, and the centrifugal force (the competition effect) exceeds the centripetal force (the spillover effect) in the second stage. As a result, firms locate at the endpoints of the market. However, in PP's model, location decision is made in the first stage, and the spillover effect is more important. Thus, firms choose interior locations. This suggests that the order of choices (whether location choice or R&D choice is made in the first stage) affects the equilibrium outcomes.",
