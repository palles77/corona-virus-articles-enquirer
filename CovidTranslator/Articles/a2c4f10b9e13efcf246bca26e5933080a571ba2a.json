The first MERS case of Korea was reported on 20 May 2015, and since then, the MERS outbreak in Korea has resulted in hundreds of confirmed cases and tens of deaths. Deadly infectious diseases such as MERS have significant direct and indirect social impacts, which include disease-induced mortality and economic losses. Also, a delayed response to the outbreak and underestimating its danger can further aggravate the situation. Hence, an analysis and establishing efficient strategies for preventing the propagation of MERS is a very important and urgent issue. In this paper, we propose a class of nonlinear susceptible-infectious-quarantined (SIQ) models for analyzing and controlling the MERS outbreak in Korea. For the SIQ based ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, we perform the task of parameter estimation, and apply optimal control theory to the controlled SIQ model, with the goal of minimizing the infectious compartment population and the cost of implementing the quarantine and isolation strategies. Simulation results show that the proposed SIQ model can explain the observed data for the confirmed cases and the quarantined cases in the MERS outbreak very well, and the number of the MERS cases can be controlled reasonably well via the optimal control approach.",

It spread remarkably fast in hospitals, which has caused the largest MERS outbreak outside the Middle East. The case fatality rate of 19.4% is, however, much lower than the reported rate of 37.7% prior to the outbreak in Korea, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The MERS-CoV is a novel betacoronavirus which was first identified from the sputum of a 60-year-old man in fall 2012 ( Zaki et al., 2012 ) .

More specifically, we propose a class of nonlinear susceptible-infectious-quarantined (SIQ) models for analyzing and controlling the MERS outbreak in Korea. The proposed SIQ model is innovative, in that the MERS https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.10.004 0022-5193/\u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. transmission probability is time-dependent, monotone decreasing, and squashing-type. More specifically, it is initially almost flat, then decreasing rapidly, and finally gradually reaching a saturation point, which is reasonable because this can reflect the change in individuals' hygienic behaviour with time. Recently, there has been much interest in investigating some aspects of the time-dependent nature of the disease transmission probability. In particular, several methods have been considered to model the time-dependence due to the impact of media coverage ( Cui et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2015 ) . However, these studies have mostly focused on only a single factor under consideration. In this paper, we consider all relevant factors that can affect the MERS transmission probability ( e.g. , media coverage, increased awareness, etc.) collectively, and try to model the resultant time-dependent transmission probability using a sigmoidal function. Note that the sigmoidal functions are quite popular in the field of machine learning when one needs to address monotone and squashing-type phenomena. For the proposed SIQ model, we perform the task of parameter estimation, and apply optimal control theory to the controlled SIQ model, with the goal of minimizing the infectious compartment population and the cost of implementing the quarantine and isolation strategies. Simulation results show that the proposed SIQ model can explain the observed data for the confirmed cases and the quarantined cases in the MERS outbreak very well, and the number of the MERS cases can be controlled reasonably well via the optimal control approach. Finally in the last two sections of this paper, discussion and concluding remarks are given along with brief descriptions of data treatment.",

The SIQ model is a generalization of an epidemiological population model involving susceptible, infectious, and quarantined compartments ( Hethcote et al., 2002; Keeling and Rohani, 2008; Lenhart and Workman, 2007; Xiao et al., 2015 ) . In the SIQ model, the four compartment populations are used as the model's state variables: S ( t ), the number of individuals that are susceptible to the MERS disease at time t; I ( t ), the number of individuals that are actively infectious at time t; S q ( t ), the number of quarantined susceptible individuals at time t ; and C q ( t ), the number of confirmed cases at time t . Note that in the SIQ model, Q stands for the super-compartment comprising S q and C q (see Fig. 1 ). Also, note that C q ( t ) is a collective sink-type compartment, which includes the number of the MERS patients under treatment, the recovered cases, and the dead cases altogether at time t . As shown in Fig. 1 , the SIQ model considers two kinds of non-pharmaceutical interventions: quarantine of the susceptible and infected individuals, and isolation of the infectious individuals following contact tracing. As a result of a contact tracing, a proportion, q , of individuals who are contacted in connection with a MERS patient is quarantined. The quarantined individuals can move to compartments C q or S q , depending on whether they are exposed to the MERS coronavirus or not. Hence, the quarantined individuals, if uninfected, move to the compartment S q at a rate of c(1 \u2212 \u03b2(t)) q,",

This term can be explained in terms of a bilinear incidence law having a contact rate c together with \u03b2( t ), the probability of the MERS transmission per contact at time t , and q , the probability of quarantine per contact. The second and third terms model the transition from S to C q and the transition from S to I , respectively. The fourth term represents the transition from S q to S , and this transition means the release from quarantine into the wider community. In the second equation of (1) , the rate of change of the infectious compartment population is described by two terms. The first represents the transition from the susceptible state to the infectious state, and the second term denotes the transition from I to C q due to detection and isolation of the infectious patients. The remaining equations of (1) describe the rates of change of S q and C q in the super-compartment Q , respectively, and the exact meaning of their terms can be explained similarly. The natural birth and death rates are not considered in the SIQ model, and this omission allows us to focus on the core theme of the paper. Note that consideration of these additional aspects is relatively straightforward, and would lead us to some further related observations.

Our parameter estimation results show that the MERS transmission probability, \u03b2( t ), is initially almost flat, then decreasing rapidly, and finally gradually reaching a saturation point (see the solid line of Fig. 5 ). This has a natural interpretation, in that as information on the MERS outbreak becomes more widely known with the passage of time, health authorities' and individuals' effort s against the epidemic intensify accordingly, which results in the MERS transmission probability decreasing in the squashing-type fashion, as in Fig. 5 . In retrospect, if the initial effort to reduce the MERS transmission probability were more effective, the magnitude of \u03b2 0 could be decreased further. In order to investigate this aspect, we additionally performed simulations for a scenario with \u03b2 0 reduced to 90% of its estimated value (see the dashed line of Fig. 5 ). Fig. 6 shows that the infectious population could be reduced significantly if the aforementioned effort were successful. In order to clarify why it is important to consider the incidence rate of the type shown in (2) , we also considered the constant beta case, and provided the corresponding simulation results ( Fig. 7 ) .

Also, note that the existence of an optimal control and corresponding optimal state trajectory comes from the convexity of the integrand of the objective function with respect to the control and the Lipschitz property of the state system with respect to the state variables (see, e.g. , Fleming and Rishel, 1975 ) , and based on the existence, we can now rely on the Pontryagin maximum principle (PMP) ( Pontryagin et al., 1987 ) for an optimal solution.

For the trade- off constants of (8) , we used c \u03b8 = 10 , 0 0 0 , c q = 1 . The initial conditions for the simulations were also taken from the estimation results, i.e. , S 0 = 16 , 0 0 0 , I 0 = 1 , and S q 0 = 0 . The simulations considered two scenarios. The first scenario does not have bounds on the control inputs, while the second scenario has the bounds of q max = 0 . 007 and \u03b8 max = 0 . 05 . With the goal of keeping the infection level low with reasonable control effort s, we solved the boundary value ODE problem (13) using bvp4c , the MATLAB function to solve boundary value problems for ordinary differen-tial equations). Figs. 8-10 show the simulation results for the first scenario. Figs. 8 and 9 show that under the optimal control of the first scenario, the best method of fighting the infection is to initially enter large amounts of q ( t ) and \u03b8 ( t ), and later after 30 days to slowly reduce them to zero. The resultant state trajectory of I ( t ) (the dashed line of Fig. 10 ) shows that, with the optimal control strategy, the infectious compartment population can be reduced significantly compared to the original case (the solid line of Fig. 10 ) . To consider the robustness of the quarantine and isola- tion control, we also conducted sensitivity analysis for the following cases: (1) when c is 10% lower and 10% higher; (2) when \u03bb is 50% lower and 50% higher. For each case we simulated the resultant controlled system, and the results on the number of infectious individuals are shown in Figs. 11 and 12 , respectively, for cases (1) and (2).

In our SIQ-based analysis, the inflection point for transmission probability was found to be t \u03b2 = 21 . 8 , corresponding to a couple of days after 7 June 2015. Interest-ingly, 7 June 2015 was the day when the Korean government revealed the names of 24 MERS-affected hospitals to the public. After releasing the names of affected medical facilities, the rate of increase in new confirmed cases abated. As a practical guideline to avoid another similar unexpected outbreak, we draw the conclusion that combined effort s in the early stage are critically important, and sharing information including the names of affected hospitals or countries, clinical situations, and prevention methods might be important for global public health control. \u2022 We applied optimal control theory to the controlled SIQ model with the goal of minimizing the infectious compartment population and the cost of implementing the quarantine and isolation strategies.
