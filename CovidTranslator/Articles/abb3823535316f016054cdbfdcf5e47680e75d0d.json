Recombinant hemagglutinin proteins of H7N9 viruses can be rapidly and efficiently produced with low-level biocontainment facilities. In this study, recombinant H7 antigen was obtained from engineered stable clones of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells for subsequent large-scale production. The stable CHO cell clones were also adapted to grow in serum-free suspension cultures. To improve the immunogenicity of the recombinant H7 antigens, we evaluated the use of a novel combination adjuvant of PELC and CpG (PELC/CpG) to augment the anti-H7N9 immune responses in mice. We compared the effects with other adjuvants such as alum, AddaVax (MF59-like), and several Toll-like receptor ligands such as R848, CpG, and poly (I:C). With the PELC/CpG combination adjuvant, CHO cell-expressed rH7 antigens containing terminally sialylated complex type N-glycans were able to induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies in sera and conferred protection following live virus challenges. These data indicate that the CHO cell-expressed recombinant H7 antigens and a PELC/CpG combination adjuvant can be used for H7N9 subunit vaccine development.",

            "text": "Influenza A viruses are negative-sense RNA viruses that belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family [1] . Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the two major viral envelope proteins that are generally used to classify different influenza A serotypes. There are 18 (H1-H18) and 11 (N1-N11) different types of HA and NA, respectively [2, 3] . The novel H7N9 avian influenza A virus isolated in 2013 China outbreaks [4, 5] has already caused five waves of human infections [6] . The fifth epidemic wave in 2016-2017 was the most severe with 759 confirmed human cases, probably due to the geographical spread of the virus from eastern China throughout the whole country [7] . More importantly, the H7N9 viruses isolated during the fifth epidemic wave have evolved into two distinct lineages, namely, the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta lineages [8] [9] [10] . Some of these fifth-epidemic-wave H7N9 isolates of Yangtze River Delta lineage carried polybasic amino acids at the HA1/HA2 cleavage site, a characteristic of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses [11] . Recent evidence indicating that the A/Shanghai/2/2013 vaccine strain may not elicit the cross-reactivity of the immune response towards recent H7N9 isolates, the World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested two additional candidate vaccine strains: A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 and A/Hong Kong/125/2017, besides for two previous vaccine strains: A/Shanghai/2/2013 and A/Anhui/1/2013 (https://www. who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/candidates_reagents/summary_ a_h7n9_cvv_20181108.pdf?ua = 1). The development of effective H7N9 vaccines is the best way to prevent further spread of the virus and curtail potential pandemic.",

            "text": "The inactivated or split H7N9 vaccines require various adjuvant systems, including alum [12] [13] [14] , MF-59 or MF59-like adjuvant [13, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , and AS03 adjuvant [17, 18, 20] ity. Preparation of inactivated or split H7N9 vaccines is essentially carried out under biosafety level 2+ or 3 facilities for egg-based or cell culture-based virus propagation, inactivation, and purification processes. Recombinant H7N9 subunit vaccines can be rapidly and efficiently produced and require low-level biocontainment for vaccine manufacturing. Recombinant H7 (rH7) antigens have been successfully expressed in E. coli, insect cells and mammalian cells; however, these antigens need adjuvant formulations to boost anti-H7N9 immunity as reported for RIG-1 ligand [21] , flagellin [22] , polyethylenimine [22] , poly (I:C) [23] , alum [24] , and squalenebased oil-in-water emulsion systems [25, 26] . As the antigenic structures of influenza HA proteins are complex and require extensive N-linked glycosylation to maintain their immunogenicity, one approach is to obtain engineered stable clones of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells for the long-term expression of recombinant HA antigens in culture supernatants. Such a production method may allow semi-continuous or continuous harvesting of recombinant glycoproteins within an extended period time, thereby providing the advantage of the development of more cost-effective industrial processes [27, 28] . Using CHO cell technology, we have recently obtained the high-yield producer stable cell clones for production of glycan-masking Pan-H5 vaccines [29] . Similar strategies have been also reported for production of a homogeneous HIV-1 envelope SOSIP trimer vaccine [30] and a MERS-coronavirus vaccine antigen [31] .",

The gene was cloned into a pIS2ID expression vector (containing the pCMV promoter, IVS, internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-driven dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and pSV40-driven zeocin resistance gene) to obtain a high-yield stable clone of CHO cells, as previously described [32] [33] [34] . CHO/ dhFr-(dhfr deficient) cells (ATCC CRL-9096, Bioresource Collection and Research Center in Taiwan) were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium Alpha medium (MEMa) with ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To amplify dhfr/H7-expressing CHO cells, selection was performed in MEMa, supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) without RNS or dRNS. The pIS2ID expression vector was transfected to CHO/dhFr-cells using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) to establish permanent clones. At 24 h post-transfection, cells from 24-well plates were subcultured in 3 duplicate wells in 6-well plates. Medium in each well was replaced with MEMa without RNS and dRNS supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 200 lg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Following 2 weeks of selection, remaining cells were diluted and inoculated into 96-well plates for single clone selection. After 2 weeks of incubation at 37\u00b0C, single cell clones were selected by visual inspection under microscopy. Additional cell clone selection was performed by gradually increasing the concentration of MTX (Sigma), which was an inhibitor of DHFR protein, from 0.02 to 0.08 to 0.32 to 1.0 lM. Selection at each concentration occurred over a 2-3 week period. Cell clones that survived following treatment with 1 mM MTX were collected and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-rH7 antibodies (GeneTex Inc.) to confirm CHO-rH7 expression. The final selected rH7-expressing clones were cultured, and the culture supernatants were harvested for rH7 purification using nickel-chelated resin affinity chromatography (Tosoh), as previously described [29] [30] [31] . The purified rH7 proteins were treated with endoglycosidase H (Endo H) (New England BioLabs) or N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (New England BioLabs) for Western blotting characterization. To obtain CHO-rH7 with highmannose (mannose-terminated) type N-glycans, we also grew the same stable CHO cell clones in medium containing 100 lM kifunensine (KIF), a mannosidase inhibitor capable of blocking the high-mannose trimming process during complex type Nglycan biosynthesis, as the procedures we previously reported [34] . To obtain CHO-rH7 with single-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-type N-glycans, the purified rH7 proteins obtained form KIF-treated CHO cell cultures were reacted with Endo H (New England Biolab) for 3 h at 37\u00b0C, where Endo H was used to cleave high mannose and some hybrid oligosaccharides from N-linked glycoproteins within the chitobiose core [34] .",

Antisera were collected 2 weeks after the second dose of immunization. At 0.2 mg dose of CHO-rH7, the total IgG antibody titer was significantly higher with PELC/CpG adjuvant than with other adjuvants (Fig. 2B) . Furthermore, at 2 mg dose of CHO-rH7, AddaVax, poly (I:C), and PELC/CpG adjuvants showed slightly higher IgG titers than the titer observed with R848, but the difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 2C) . Therefore, the formulation containing CHO-rH7 in combination with PELC/CpG triggered the strongest IgG response. The titer of IgG1 subtype induced by PELC/CpG adjuvant was significantly higher than that induced by alum, R848, CpG, AddaVax, and poly (I:C) adjuvants at 0.2 and 2 mg doses of CHO-rH7 (Fig. 3A, D) . Furthermore. PELC/ CpG and poly (I:C) adjuvants yielded higher titers of IgG2a than alum, R848, and CpG adjuvants (Fig. 3B, E) . Our results also showed that 0.2 and 2 mg doses of CHO-rH7 formulated with PELC/CpG adjuvant had significantly higher IgG2b titers than those induced by alum, R848, CpG, AddaVax, and poly (I:C) adjuvants (Fig. 3C,  F) . Since, Th1 and Th2 are known to drive the induction of IgG1 and IgG2a secretion, adjuvanting with PELC/CpG appears to enhance both Th1 and Th2 cellular responses. Use of PELC/CpG adjuvant also resulted in higher IgG2a and IgG2b titers that are more capable of activating Fc effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.",

PELC and MF59-like AddaVax adjuvants are formulated using squalene-based oil-in-water emulsions that are similar in composition to MF59 adjuvant (4.3% squalene, 0.5% Span85, and 0.5% Tween 80 in citrate buffer) [36] . PELC formulation had only one different composition, obtained by replacing Tween 80 with a biodegradable poly(ethylene glycol)-b lock-poly(lactide-co-e-caprolactone) (PEG-b-PLACL) polymer, as compared with MF59-like AddaVax adjuvant [37] . The effects of these adjuvants on the augmentation of rH7 immunogenicity were compared with alum, an adjuvant that is known to cause cell death and release numerous molecules that act as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to alert the innate immune systems [38] . Alum can also activate NLRP3 inflammasomes for the induction of effective B-cell responses and Th2 biased cellular immune response [39] . MF59 or AddaVax (MF-59 like) is a more potent adjuvant that elicits a broader immune responses than alum adjuvant [40] .

We have previously reported that CHO-rH7 antigens lost the ability to agglutinate turkey RBCs as well as to bind to sialic acids-containing bovine fetuin glycproteins, whereas Sf9 insect cell-derived rH7 (Sf9-rH7) antigens retained both these properties [26] . Although CHO-rH7 antigens were unable to agglutinate RBCs or bind sialic acids-containing fetuin, the data established in the present study clearly demonstrated that CHO-rH7 antigens were immunogenic for inducing anti-H7N9 immune responses in mice. We also obtained two other N-glycan types of CHO-rH7 antigen: (i) CHO-rH7 (KIF) with high mannose-type Nglycans and (ii) CHO-rH7 (KIF + E) with single GlcNAc-type Nglycans. Only the CHO-rH7 (KIF + E) antigen, but not the CHO-rH7 (KIF) antigen, was able to regain a weak property for RBC agglutination (data not shown). With PELC/CpG combination adjuvant, a 0.2 mg dose of CHO-rH7 but not CHO-rH7 (KIF) and CHO-rH7 (KIF + E) elicited a protective response and conferred protection in survival and body weight recovery of the immunized mice following live virus challenges. The results are in contradictory to HIV-1 gp120 antigen produced in CHO cells where limiting N-linked glycosylation to early oligomannose glycans can enhance the HIV-1 subunit vaccine efficacy [42] . Our present results demonstrated that CHO cell-expressed rH7 antigens containing terminally sialylated complex type N-glycans, but not high mannose-type or single GlcNAc-type N-glycans, can provide protection against H7N9 infections. Furthermore, we have previously reported that CHO-rH5 antigens for the removal of terminal sialic acid moieties can improve the immunity, when compared with the N-linked complex type CHO-rH5 antigens or the paucimannose-type Sf9/Mimic cellderived rH5 antigens [33] . Ongoing studies investigating CHO-rH7 antigens after the removal of sialic acid moieties may further improve their anti-H7N9 immunity.",
