            "text": "Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of TB-LAMP, a manual molecular tuberculosis (TB) detection method, and provide comparison to the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Methods: In a large multicentre study, two sputum samples were collected from participants with TB symptoms in reference laboratories in Peru, South Africa, Brazil, and Vietnam. Each sample was tested with TB-LAMP. The reference standard consisted of four direct smears, four cultures, and clinical and radiological findings. Individuals negative on conventional tests were followed up after 8 weeks. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay was performed on fresh or frozen samples as a molecular test comparison. Results: A total of 1036 adults with suspected TB were enrolled. Among 375 culture-confirmed TB cases with 750 sputum samples, TB-LAMP detected 75.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 71.8-79.4%), including 97.9% (95% CI 96.4-99.4%) of smear-positive TB samples and 46.6% (95% CI 40.6-52.7%) of smear-negative TB samples. Specificity in 477 culture-negative participants not treated for TB (954 sputum samples) was 98.7% (95% CI 97.9-99.6%). TB-LAMP test results were indeterminate in 0.3% of cases. Conclusions: TB-LAMP detects nearly all smear-positive and half of smear-negative TB cases and has a high specificity when performed in reference laboratories. Performance was similar to the Xpert MTB/RIF assay.",

The lack of rapid and accurate diagnostic tools contributed to the estimated 4.1 million cases of TB that went unreported (TDR, FIND SA, 2006) . Smear microscopy, the first line in TB detection, has a low and variable sensitivity (30-70%) (Steingart et al., 2006; Aber et al., 1980; Urbanczik, 1985) . Conventional culture on solid media has a sensitivity of 80-90%, but requires 2-8 weeks for a result (Lee et al., 2003; Somosk\u00f6vi et al., 2000) . Although conventional liquid culture (Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT); Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) typically has sensitivity greater than 95%, the time to result is still up to 4 weeks. This results in individuals being lost to follow-up and treatment delays (Stall et al., 2011) .",

LAMP is an attractive diagnostics platform because it takes less than 2 h to perform, requires minimal instrumentation, and generates a fluorescent result that can be detected with the naked eye (Notomi et al., 2000) . Furthermore, it has shown potential as a cross-disease platform, with assays developed for malaria, African trypanosomiasis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and influenza (Kuboki et al., 2003; Poon et al., 2005a Poon et al., ,b, 2006 . The TB-LAMP assay requires only minimal instrumentation in the form of a heating block. Additionally, it has the potential for higher throughput as it can test up to 14 samples per test run (Boehme et al., 2011; Vassall et al., 2011) . A full description of the TB-LAMP procedure can be found in the recent World Health Organization (WHO) policy guidance (WHO Policy Guidance, 2016) .",

Directed follow-up was not performed for participants with Xpert MTB/RIF-positive and bacteriologically negative results; furthermore, the use of an imperfect standard will have a more deleterious effect on an assay with higher specificity. Although it could not be confirmed, it is possible that specimen decontamination before culture in Brazil was performed using 2% NaOH (where 1-1.5% is recommended), which would have destroyed weakly growing mycobacteria, thereby lowering culture sensitivity (Kent and Kubica, 1985; Global Laboratory Initiative, 2014) . This hypothesis is further supported by the high number of smear-positive, culture-negative results found in Brazil. Finally, the laboratory in Brazil had lower sensitivity using FM (45.7%) than the more standard ZN (69.4%)the opposite of what would be expected based on a previous meta-analysis of the two methods (Steingart et al., 2006) .",
