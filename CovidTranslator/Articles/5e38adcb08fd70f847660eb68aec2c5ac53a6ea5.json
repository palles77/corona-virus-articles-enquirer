In 1992, an American-European consensus conference established specific diagnostic criteria for the syndrome 2 ; these criteria were updated in 2012 in the so-called Berlin definition 3 of ARDS in adults (Box 1). Depending on the level of oxygenation, 'mild' , 'moderate' and 'severe' descriptors can be added to the diagnosis of ARDS (Box 1). The diagnosis of ARDS depends on clinical criteria alone because it is not practical to obtain direct measurements of lung injury by pathological samples of lung tissue in most patients; furthermore, neither distal airspace nor blood samples can be used to diagnose ARDS.",

In addition, randomized trials to optimize mechanical ventilation and fluid therapy for ARDS have resulted in improved clinical outcomes.

Calfee 1 Abstract | The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common cause of respiratory failure in critically ill patients and is defined by the acute onset of noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, hypoxaemia and the need for mechanical ventilation. ARDS occurs most often in the setting of pneumonia, sepsis, aspiration of gastric contents or severe trauma and is present in ~10% of all patients in intensive care units worldwide. Despite some improvements, mortality remains high at 30-40% in most studies. Pathological specimens from patients with ARDS frequently reveal diffuse alveolar damage, and laboratory studies have demonstrated both alveolar epithelial and lung endothelial injury , resulting in accumulation of protein-rich inflammatory oedematous fluid in the alveolar space. Diagnosis is based on consensus syndromic criteria, with modifications for under-resourced settings and in paediatric patients. Treatment focuses on lung-protective ventilation; no specific pharmacotherapies have been identified. Long-term outcomes of patients with ARDS are increasingly recognized as important research targets, as many patients survive ARDS only to have ongoing functional and/or psychological sequelae. Future directions include efforts to facilitate earlier recognition of ARDS, identifying responsive subsets of patients and ongoing efforts to understand fundamental mechanisms of lung injury to design specific treatments.",

The investigators used a validated screening protocol to identify patients with ARDS (defined as a partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2 ) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) ratio (PaO 2 / FiO 2 ) of <300 mmHg and bilateral chest radiographic opacities without evidence of left-sided heart failure). On the basis of these data, the authors estimated an annual incidence of 190,000 cases of ARDS in the United States with a hospital mortality of 38.5%. Subsequently, the LUNG-SAFE study provided valuable data in a crosssectional analysis of 29,144 patients in 50 countries during the winter of 2014 (ref. 5 ); in this study, the prevalence of ARDS in patients in intensive care was 10%, and ARDS was identified in 23% of all ventilated patients. A detailed review of ARDS incidence and time-related changes in epidemiological factors has been recently published 6 .",

For example, a followup analysis of the LUNG-SAFE study determined that 21% of patients with ARDS in the study were immunocompromised, and hospital mortality was much higher in these patients than in non-immunocompromised patients (52% versus 36%; P < 0.0001) 7 .",

Diabetes mellitus has been associated with a lower risk of ARDS development for reasons that remain unclear 14, 15 , although data from the LUNG-SAFE study showed no association between diabetes and the diagnosis of ARDS, developing ARDS or outcomes of ARDS 16 . A two-centre clinical study identified the major recipient risk factors for developing TRALI, including recent liver surgery, chronic alcohol abuse, current cigarette smoking, higher peak airway pressure (that is, the highest airway pressure while being ventilated) and positive fluid balance 17 . Transfusion risk factors were receipt of whole blood or fresh frozen plasma from a female donor and the quantity of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II antibody or the volume concentration of anti-human neutrophil antigen in the transfused blood components. There was no risk associated with the age of the stored blood. Indeed, eliminating fresh frozen plasma or whole-blood transfusion from female donors markedly reduced the incidence of TRALI, implicating a role for allogeneic antibodies in the pathogenesis of TRALI. In blunt and penetrating trauma, the severity and duration of shock, chest injury, the number of blood product transfusions, the presence of traumatic brain injury and the quantity of crystalloid fluids (as a volume expander) can each contribute to the risk of developing ARDS 18, 19 .",

However, other strategies, including candidate gene and pathway analyses, have revealed potentially important mechanisms of lung injury that seem to be associated with risk of developing ARDS and, in some associations, higher mortality 25 . For example, plasma angiopoietin 2 (encoded by ANGPT2) is a protein marker and mediator of increased lung vascular permeability; using a quantitative trait loci analysis, five ANGPT2 genetic variants in a population with European ancestry have been associated with increased levels of plasma angiopoietin 2, and two of the five variants were associated with increased ARDS risk.

A history of prematurity, cancer or immune compromise are risk factors for mortality. The severity of hypoxaemia has consistently predicted mortality in paediatric cohorts 32 . In intubated children in the PARDIE study, severe ARDS (defined as PaO 2 /FiO 2 <100 mmHg) was associated with threefold higher mortality than in children with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 of 100-300 mmHg (ref. 28 ). In addition, a history of cancer or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in paediatric patients with ARDS resulted in a mortality of 43% versus 11% in children without these risk factors in a prospective multicentre study 33 .",

The selective barrier to fluid and solutes in the uninjured lung is established by a single-layer lining of endothelial cells linked by plasma membrane structures, including adherens and tight junctions 34 . The vast surface of the alveolar epithelium is lined by flat alveolar type I (ATI) cells along with cuboidal shaped alveolar type II (ATII) cells, forming a very tight barrier that restricts even the passage of small solutes but allows diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen. The ATII cells secrete surfactant, the critical factor that reduces surface tension, enabling the alveoli to remain open and facilitating gas exchange. Both ATI and ATII cells have the capacity to absorb excess fluid from the airspaces by vectorial ion transport, primarily by apical sodium channels and basolateral Na + /K + -ATPase pumps 35 . Thus, when alveolar oedema develops, reabsorption of the oedematous fluid depends on junctions between ATI and ATII cells and intact ion transport channels in the epithelial cells. Once the oedematous fluid is absorbed into the lung interstitium, the fluid can be removed primarily by lymphatics and the lung microcirculation. The cellular makeup of the normal alveolus includes alveolar macrophages but not polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils), although they can be rapidly recruited from the circulation. Alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and other immune effector cells, including monocytes and platelets, are critical in defence of the normal lung and have key activities in acute lung injury.",

Next, the oedematous fluid translocates to the alveoli, often facilitated by injury to the normally tight barrier properties of the alveolar epithelium. Increased alveolar-capillary permeability to fluid, proteins, neutrophils and red blood cells (resulting in their accumulation into the alveolar space) is the hallmark of ARDS [36] [37] [38] . Arterial hypoxaemia in patients with ARDS is caused by ventilation-to-perfusion mismatch as well as right-to-left intrapulmonary shunting. In addition, impaired excretion of carbon dioxide is a major component of respiratory failure, resulting in elevated minute ventilation that is associated with an increase in pulmonary dead space (that is, the volume of a breath that does not participate in carbon dioxide excretion). Elevation of pulmonary dead space and a decrease in respiratory compliance are independent predictors of mortality in ARDS 39 . ",

Eosinophilic depositions termed hyaline membranes are also defining features of DAD, the classic histopathological hallmark of ARDS [40] [41] [42] . The other findings include alveolar haemorrhage, accumulation of white blood cells (usually predominantly neutrophils), fibrin deposition and some areas of alveolar atelectasis (collapse). After the initial exudative phase, ATII cell hyperplasia follows in a 'proliferative' phase that can last >3 weeks in survivors; interstitial fibrosis can also occur in this phase. The original description of DAD was based heavily on analyses of lungs of patients dying with oxygen toxicity, although similar histological changes were identified in lungs from patients with a variety of conditions that underlie ARDS 40 . Recent reports reveal that DAD is present in only a subset of patients with clinical ARDS, and pathological heterogeneity is evident [41] [42] [43] [44] . For example, one study carried out over two decades (1991-2010) on post-mortem samples reported that 45% of patients who met the Berlin criteria for ARDS had DAD, whereas the other 55% had alveolar inflammation consistent with acute pneumonia with infiltration of neutrophils in the alveoli and distal bronchioles 44 . Importantly, this study also found that the incidence of DAD declined in the decade after lung-protective ventilation was implemented. Recent reports also indicate key temporal features of histological progression, identify the association of DAD with severity of ARDS and provide evidence that the first 7 days after onset represent a critical window for potential therapeutic intervention 43, 44 . In addition, one meta-analysis of open lung biopsy samples in patients with ARDS found that DAD was present in only 48% of the patients and was associated with a higher mortality 45 .",

Endothelial 'damage' and 'injury' are commonly described, and recent evidence suggests that apoptosis 36 and alternative cell death pathways such as pyroptosis 51 might be involved. Conceptually, an increase in lung vascular permeability can occur because of a functional breakdown in endothelial junctions or by death of endothelial cells. Ultrastructural alterations of alveolar endothelial cells are frequently subtle compared with the dramatic epithelial cell disruption observed in autopsy analysis 37 ( fig. 2 ), suggesting functional barrier impairment. Experimental evidence has shown that endothelial cell activation can occur, induced by inflammatory signals from microorganisms (including lipopolysaccharide and other toxins) and lung white blood cells in response to pathogens (as in pneumonia or nonpulmonary sepsis), injury from aspiration syndromes, ischaemiareperfusion (as in trauma-induced shock) or blood product transfusions as in TRALI 36 . Endothelial cell activation may result in mediator generation (such as angio poietin 2) and leukocyte accumulation (accompanied by upregulation of P-selectin and E-selectin (cell adhesion molecules) in the lung microvessels, especially in the post-capillary venules) 36 . Platelet and neutrophil deposition characteristically occur, often as neutrophilplatelet aggregates ( fig. 3) , as a result of endothelial cell activation. Neutrophils and platelets seem to play a synergistic role in causing an increase in lung vascular permeability to protein (see below). Endothelial disruption can also be caused by pathogens and their toxins; endogenous danger-associated molecular patterns; barrier-destabilizing factors generated by alveolar macrophages, circulating leukocytes and platelets; and pro-inflammatory signalling molecules such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF), the inflammasome product IL-1\u03b2, angiopoietin 2, vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-activating factor and others 36 . Increased systemic vascular permeability frequently also occurs, often contributing to hypovolaemia and multiple organ failure.",

Although the duration of increased lung endothelial permeability induced by specific insults in clinical ARDS is unknown, this model and more recent studies in mice suggest that it can persist for many hours to weeks [52] [53] [54] .

            "text": "VE-cadherin disruption. Studies using cultured endothelium and murine models indicate that homophilic calcium-dependent vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) bonds between adjacent endothelial cells are critical for basal lung microvascular integrity and that their 'loosening' is central in increased alveolar-capillary permeability in inflammatory acute lung injury 36 . VEcadherin and TIE2, an endothelial receptor kinase, act in concert to establish junctional integrity and are regulated by vascular endothelial-protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP; also known as receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase \u03b2). Genetic or pharmacological manipulation of the molecular interactions and activities of VE-cadherin, TIE2 and VE-PTP alters alveolar leak in a complex fashion in mice 36, 55 . VE-cadherin function and adherens junction stability are also regulated by cytoskeletal interactions, small GTPases and other intracellular modulators, multiple molecular interactions (including associations with catenins, plakoglobin and VE-PTP) and phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events 36, 56 . A variety of insults (such as acid, viruses, ventilatorassociated lung injury , hyperoxia or bacteria) can injure the epithelium, either directly or by inducing inflammation, which in turn injures the epithelium. Direct injury is inevitably exacerbated by a secondary wave of inflammatory injury. Activation of Toll-like receptors (not shown) on alveolar type II (ATII) cells and resident macrophages induces the secretion of chemokines, which recruit circulating immune cells into the airspaces. As neutrophils migrate across the epithelium, they release toxic mediators, including proteases, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which have an important role in host defence but cause endothelial and epithelial injury. Monocytes also migrate into the lung and can cause injury , including epithelial cell apoptosis via IFN\u03b2-dependent release of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL), which activates death receptors. Activated platelets form aggregates with polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes, which are involved in NET formation, and monocyte-platelet aggregates. Red blood cells (RBCs) release cell-free haemoglobin, which exacerbates injury via oxidant-dependent mechanisms. Angiopoietin 2 inhibits TIE2-stabilization of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin); vascular endothelial growth factor and other permeability-promoting agonists also destabilize VE-cadherin via dissociation from p120-catenin, resulting in its internalization and enhanced paracellular permeability. Additionally , loss of cell-cell adhesion in the setting of actomyosin contraction results in the formation of occasional gaps between endothelial cells. Epithelial injury also includes wounding of the plasma membrane, which can be induced by bacterial pore-forming toxins or mechanical stretch, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Together, these effects result in endothelial and epithelial permeability , which further facilitate the transmigration of leukocytes and lead to the influx of oedematous fluid and RBCs. Airspace filling with oedematous fluid causes hypoxaemia, resulting in the need for mechanical ventilation. The vascular injury and alveolar oedema contribute to the decreased ability to excrete CO 2 (hypercapnia), accounting for the elevated pulmonary dead space in acute respiratory distress syndrome. In turn, hypoxaemia and hypercapnia impair vectorial sodium transport, reducing alveolar oedema clearance.

Because ATI cells provide >95% of the normal surface area of the alveolar epithelium and facilitate gas exchange, the process of generating new ATI cells is critical to the complete repair process. However, initially the proliferation of ATII cells can provide a provisional epithelial barrier before they transdifferentiate into ATI cells ( fig. 4 ). Many growth factors contribute to ATII cell proliferation and, although ATII cells are the default progenitors responsible for creating new alveolar epithelial cells through proliferation, in severe injury, alternate progenitor cells may be mobilized. These alternate progenitor cells include club cells 76 (secretory cells that normally line the airways), bronchoalveolar stem cells and keratin-5-expressing (KRT5 + ) cells 68, 77 . Expansion of KRT5 + epithelial progenitors is driven by HIF-NOTCH and fibrocyte growth factor receptor 2 signalling 78 , with ATII cell fate induced by WNT-\u03b2-catenin and impeded by NOTCH and HIF 79 (fig. 5 ). The mechanisms underlying ATII-to-ATI transdifferentiation are less well understood, but recent studies have suggested that deactivation of WNT-\u03b2-catenin is necessary 80 . Our knowledge of the regenerative role of the alternative progenitors is mainly based on mouse models of lung injury, although there is evidence that some of these progenitors exist in humans as well 79 .",

Additionally, damaged mitochondria are degraded via mitophagy and replaced via biogenesis or mitochondrial transfer 84 .

The timing of endothelial and epithelial repair in various causes of acute lung injury has not been systematically worked out. Once epithelial barrier integrity is restored, oedematous fluid can be reabsorbed to the interstitium either by paracellular pathways or by diffusion through water channels driven by an osmotic gradient that is established by active apical sodium uptake, in part by the epithelial sodium channels and sodium transport through the Na + /K + -ATPase pumps ( fig. 5) .",

Mice in which the alveolar type II (ATII) epithelial cells and all their progeny express green fluorescent protein (GFP) (SftpcCreERT2;mTmG mice) were treated with intratracheal lipopolysaccharide to induce lung injury. Mice were euthanized 27 days later and lung sections were stained for GFP (green), the alveolar type I (ATI) cell marker T1\u03b1 (purple) and 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; for nuclear staining (blue)). Some ATII cell-derived cells (GFP-staining cells in panels a (\u00d740) and c (\u00d740)) expressed ATI markers (T1\u03b1-staining cells in panels b (\u00d740) and c), as shown by dual GFP-staining and T1\u03b1-staining cells (panel c) -indicating transdifferentiation during repair after lung injury. Arrowheads indicate nascent ATI cells that transdifferentiated from ATII cells during repair after injury (dual GFPstaining and T1\u03b1-staining cells). Arrows indicate ATI cells that withstood the initial injury (GFP-negative but T1a-staining cells). These experimental data support the notion that ATI cells are damaged during acute lung injury and are then replaced by ATII cells that transdifferentiate into ATI cells. Reprinted with permission of the American Thoracic Society. supplemental oxygen and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was life-saving in this context. For many years, the standard therapy with mechanical ventilation support included high tidal volumes (12-15 ml per kg PBW). Nevertheless, a potential contribution of high tidal volumes and elevated airway pressures to worsening acute lung injury was suggested by preclinical studies beginning in 1974 (refs 91-93 ). The clinical importance of VALI was provided by the ARMA trial in 2000 (see below, Management), in which lower tidal volume and limited airway pressure markedly reduced mortality in patients with ARDS 94 . The mechanisms for VALI have been established in both experimental and clinical studies. High tidal volume and elevated airway pressure induce biomechanical inflammatory injury and necrosis of the lung endothelium and alveolar epithelium that are associated with release of neutrophil products, including proteases, oxidants and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and a reduction in the capacity of the alveolar epithelium to remove oedematous fluid 36, 95, 96 . Clinical studies focused on biology and clinical factors have also confirmed the injurious effects of high tidal volume in patients with ARDS (see below). It should be emphasized that it has not been possible to eliminate VALI as it can still occur from patient-ventilator dyssynchrony and elevated plateau airway pressure (that is, the elevated pressures generated by the mechanical ventilator to the alveoli), especially in patients with severe lung injury and extensive pulmonary oedema.",

In an attempt to overcome this obstacle, investigators have sought to further understand the biology of human ARDS through studies of human samples obtained from observational and interventional clinical studies. These studies from patients with ARDS have validated several pathophysiological observations from experimental studies, led to the identification of promising prognostic biomarkers in humans (Box 2) and identified molecular subphenotypes of human ARDS that may have therapeutic implications.",

            "text": "Initial studies of ARDS pathogenesis using human samples confirmed that the biological mechanisms identified in many models are relevant. Important initial observations included confirmation in humans of the fundamental hallmark of ARDS, disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier, by documentation of elevated protein levels in pulmonary oedematous fluid 38, 98 . Subsequent studies of biological markers from bronchoalveolar lavage, pulmonary oedematous fluid or (most commonly) plasma (which is more readily available in most cases) demonstrated that endothelial injury [99] [100] [101] and an exaggerated inflammatory response 102,103 are consistent features of human ARDS. Endothelial activation in particular seems to occur early in the development of Fig. 5 | The repaired alveolus. Several mechanisms promote endothelial cell junctional reassembly. Slit binds to its receptor, ROBO4, stabilizing the adherens junctions by promoting the association between p120-catenin and vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) (not shown). Activated platelets release the lipid mediator sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which activates Rho/Rac signalling to induce cytoskeletal reorganization that promotes endothelial barrier integrity (not shown). The receptor tyrosine kinase TIE2 is bound by its activating ligand, angiopoietin 1, which results in actin cytoskeletal reorganization and stability of VE-cadherin at the adherens junctions (not shown). To repair the damaged epithelium, surviving alveolar type II (ATII) cells replace lost epithelial cells via proliferation and differentiation into alveolar type I (ATI) cells. Many growth factors promote ATII proliferation, including keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) 80 , hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF); similarly , transcriptional pathways also promote ATII proliferation, including the WNT-\u03b2-catenin pathway 80 human ARDS, in some cases predating frank respiratory failure 104 . Lung epithelial injury in human ARDS has been identified by measurement of impaired alveolar fluid clearance 75 and more recently by measurement of specific markers of alveolar epithelial cell injury, including surfactant protein D 105 and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a marker of lung epithelial injury and innate immune activation 106 . Importantly, many of these markers of injury have also been linked to poor clinical outcomes in ARDS (Box 2), suggesting that the severity of the endothelial and epithelial injury in humans is a major determinant of clinical outcome 107 . Biological samples from interventional clinical trials in ARDS have proved to be particularly useful in furthering understanding of ARDS pathogenesis. As one example, analysis of plasma inflammatory markers from patients enrolled in the seminal trial of low tidal volume ventilation for ARDS 94 demonstrated that a lung-protective ventilation strategy decreased circulating markers of inflammation (IL-6 and IL-8) compared with a traditional high tidal volume strategy 108 . Analyses of plasma levels of RAGE from the same trial confirmed that lung-protective ventilation also decreased alveolar epithelial cell injury compared with traditional tidal volumes 109 . Another study reported a reduction in distal airspace IL-6, TNF and neutrophils in patients treated with a lung-protective ventilation strategy 110 .",

In ARDS, biological heterogeneity has long been suspected as a potential obstacle to successful development of therapeutics; early descriptions of the syndrome speculated whether direct (that is, pulmonary) and indirect (that is, nonpulmonary) causes of ARDS, for example, might be pathologically distinct 2 . Supporting this hypothesis, a recent analysis of direct and indirect ARDS in two clinical cohorts showed that patients with direct lung injury had higher plasma levels of biomarkers of lung epithelial injury (such as RAGE and surfactant protein D), whereas patients with indirect lung injury had higher plasma levels of biomarkers of endothelial injury and inflammation (including angiopoietin 2) 111 .",

If validated in prospective clinical studies, this approach suggests that future clinical trials targeting patients on the basis of distinct biological subphenotype may be more successful than trials based on a clinical syndromic definition. The definitive mechanistic differences between these two subphenotypes, including whether they are driven by environmental or genetic factors, remain yet to be identified.

Chest radiograph interpretation is inherently (at present) subjective, and investigators studying chest radiograph interpretation in ARDS in particular have demonstrated suboptimal inter-rater reliability 120 . Similarly, differentiation of ARDS from hydrostatic pulmonary oedema due to heart failure and/or volume overload can be difficult in critically ill patients (fig. 6 ). The 1992 consensus definition of ARDS included a requirement that the pulmonary arterial wedge pressure be <18 mmHg if measured; however, pulmonary arterial catheters are now rarely used in this setting, primarily because a randomized trial showed no clinical benefit of their use compared with central venous catheters in 1,000 patients with ARDS 121 . The Berlin definition of ARDS recommends the use of echocardiography to assess cardiac function if no clear ARDS risk factor is identified. Other tests that may be useful in this distinction include measurement of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP; which, if elevated, suggests cardiac insufficiency), assessment of the vascular pedicle width on chest radiograph (which suggests intravascular volume overload) and/or measurement of the ratio of protein in pulmonary oedema fluid to plasma (which, if <0.65, suggests elevated lung vascular pressures as in cardiogenic pulmonary oedema versus a ratio >0.65, which suggests increased alveolar-capillary permeability as in ARDS), although this test is less widely available 122, 123 . These complexities may contribute to persistent underrecognition of ARDS by clinicians. In under-resourced settings without ready access to advanced diagnostic modalities and therapies, diagnosis of ARDS can be further hindered. Thus, in 2016, investigators proposed alternative criteria for ARDS diagnosis in the absence of chest radiography, mechanical ventilation and/or blood gas measurements -the so-called Kigali modification of the Berlin criteria 124 (Box 1).",

Such mimics include acute eosinophilic pneumonia, diffuse alveolar haemor rhage, acute interstitial pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and acute heart failure ( fig. 6 ). ARDS occurs in the setting of an underlying risk factor (for example, sepsis, pneumonia or severe trauma); identification of this risk factor is required to ensure that the patient actually has ARDS and not an ARDS mimic and because treatment of the underlying risk factor is vitally important for patient care. If no ARDS risk factor is readily apparent, suspicion for an ARDS mimic should increase. In this case, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and cell counts and differential can be helpful diagnostically. If the aetiology remains unclear after bronchoscopy, lung biopsy (thoracoscopic or, less commonly, open) may be considered if results would change patient management. Studies on the diagnostic yield of lung biopsy samples in these settings report varying diagnostic yields (60-84%) and substantial morbidity and mortality; a recent review a b Fig. 6 | Distinguishing ARDS on radiography. Similarities in the chest radiographs from a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from influenza pneumonia (panel a) and a patient with pulmonary oedema due to cardiac failure (panel b) reflect the difficulty in identifying ARDS. In both cases, diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities are consistent with alveolar filling. The cardiac silhouette (panel b) is slightly more globular, consistent with heart failure; however, this feature is not reliable for distinguishing ARDS from cardiogenic pulmonary oedema.",

Given the differences in ARDS between adults and children, the international Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference (PALICC) defined criteria for PARDS 126 (Box 3). There are major differences between the PALICC PARDS definition and the adult American-European Consensus Conference or Berlin definitions. In PARDS, as in the Kigali modification of the Berlin definition, the peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) to FiO 2 ratio is used when arterial PaO 2 is not available; however, lung ultrasonography is not incorporated into the diagnostic criteria for PARDS 126 . The presence of bilateral radiographic opacities, used to distinguish diffuse lung disease but difficult to detect with accuracy, is not required for PARDS 126 . Hypoxia assessment for intubated children requires adjustment for level of respiratory support using mean airway pressure (MAP) by calculating an oxygenation index 126 (Box 3). Neonates outside of the perinatal period were included in the PARDS definition, and additional criteria for diagnosing PARDS in children with paediatric cyanotic congenital heart disease and chronic lung disease were proposed 126 . The PARDS definition was more inclusive, aiming to diagnose ARDS in the early stages. Children diagnosed with PARDS using the PALICC criteria had 24% mortality if they also met the Berlin criteria, versus <8.5% if they did not 28 . If the patients were treated with noninvasive ventilation and using the oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) to FiO 2 ratio for diagnosis with unilateral infiltrates, the mortality was 7%. Neonatal lung disease experts have proposed a consensus definition for neonatal ARDS called the Montreaux definition 127 , which is proposed for neonates from birth to 44 weeks post-menstrual age (4 weeks if born at term). Children with respiratory distress syndrome from prematurity and surfactant deficiency and those with transient tachypnoea of the newborn or congenital anomalies causing the respiratory condition are excluded. The Montreaux definition is similar to the PALICC PARDS definition (Box 3) in terms of timing and uses PALICC cut-offs for oxygenation index but requires arterial or transcutaneous oxygen tension values rather than SpO 2 . Furthermore, determining origin of oedema requires use of echocardiography to verify absence of congenital heart disease as a contributor, and imaging must show diffuse bilateral infiltrates or complete lung opacification. Validation of these definitions is needed in large prospective cohorts with autopsy and pathophysiological correlates to differentiate ARDS from other causes of hypoxaemia.",

The negative predictive value of the LIPS is high, but the positive predictive value even in the original description was low (18% for a LIPS \u22654); a clinical trial using this LIPS cut-off as an enrolment criterion found an even lower positive predictive value of 10% 137 . An alternative approach is the Early Acute Lung Injury (EALI) score, which aims to identify patients with incipient lung injury before frank ARDS 138, 139 . This simpler score was developed from analysis of patients with acute bilateral radiographic opacities and is comprised of three variables: level of supplemental oxygen required; tachypnoea; and presence of immune suppression. In comparison with LIPS, the negative predictive value of the EALI score was again high, but the positive predictive value was better (53%). Although the LIPS and EALI scores have not been rigorously tested in children, the PARDIE study showed that many children with mild disease will progress to meeting the Berlin criteria within 3 days of being diagnosed with PARDS.",

Angiopoietin 2 and IL-8 were also found to be elevated in critically ill patients before ARDS development 104 . In this analysis, angiopoietin 2 improved the positive predictive value of the LIPS.

Unfortunately, most trials focused on prevention using pharmacotherapies have met disappointing results. In the earliest trials to test this approach, corticosteroids were evaluated for ARDS prevention in at-risk patients, with no evidence of benefit 143, 144 . More recently, a phase IIb clinical trial testing aspirin as a preventive therapy in at-risk patients was negative 137 , although a subsequent re-analysis of the data raised interesting issues 62 . A smaller phase IIa trial of aerosolized budesonide (a corticosteroid) and formoterol (a long-acting \u03b2 2 -agonist that may improve alveolar fluid clearance) demonstrated improved oxygenation and a decreased rate of progression to ARDS in the treatment group, although baseline randomization imbalances may have affected this result 145 . In contrast to these results with pharmacotherapy trials, studies evaluating the use of low tidal volume ventilation in mechanically ventilated patients without ARDS have provided more evidence of benefit 146, 147 , but a recent large clinical trial comparing low with intermediate tidal volumes in patients without ARDS was negative 148 . Several studies have noted reductions in nosocomial ARDS incidence thought to be associated with improvements in supportive care 149, 150 .",

A French trial illustrated the potential value of this approach, comparing high-flow nasal cannula to noninvasive ventilation and face-mask oxygen in 310 non-intubated patients with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 <300 mmHg (ref. 151 ). The majority of patients (64%) had pneumonia, and 79% had bilateral radiographic opacities on chest radiography, indicating that they likely had early ARDS. High-flow nasal cannula did not affect the primary outcome of endotracheal intubation but did lead to statistically significantly lower mortality than both noninvasive ventilation (P = 0.006) and face-mask oxygenation (P = 0.046). This trial may serve as a useful paradigm for future early treatment trials in selected patient populations, especially emphasizing the opportunity to identify patients in the early phase of acute lung injury before endotracheal intubation (fig. 8 ). Of note, the potential benefit of high-flow nasal cannula may not be generalizable across all patients in intensive care. A recent randomized controlled study showed that high-flow oxygen therapy did not significantly decrease 28-day mortality compared with standard oxygen therapy among critically ill immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure 152 .",

However, as general principles, when prescribing antimicrobial therapies targeting lung infections, clinicians should consider antibiotic potency (low minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values against the organism), likelihood of antimicrobial resistance, ability of the antibiotic to penetrate lung tissue and speed of lung penetration 153 . Continuous infusions can increase the amount of time antibiotics exceed the MIC and have been shown to improve clinical outcomes with certain antibiotics 154 .

            "text": "Tidal volume. The ARDS lung is non-uniformly aerated, with nonaerated areas predominantly in gravitydependent regions, owing to the superimposed weight of inflammatory pulmonary oedematous fluid 156 . Aerated lung volume is much smaller than normal, a phenomenon termed baby lung, identified and illustrated first with CT scans; this concept of the baby lung accounts for the low compliance of the respiratory system because it identifies the areas of the lung that are consolidated with oedema and inflammation and associated atelectasis 157 . Thus, lower tidal volumes are needed in ARDS to prevent regional overdistension, as described above. However, scaling tidal volume to PBW targets estimated healthy lung size, although aerated baby lung volume can differ substantially between patients. Although the crucial importance of the use of a low tidal volume is now universally accepted, the best method for scaling tidal volume to patient-specific surrogates of stress or strain is still debated 158, 159 and warrants further investigation. Targeting airway driving pressure (plateau pressure minus PEEP) is one strategy for tailoring tidal volume to patient-specific mechanics that has garnered considerable attention 159 , but a universally safe threshold has yet to be validated in a prospective trial. For patients with mild lung injury at lower risk of biophysical injury, the benefit conferred by lowering tidal volume should be weighed against risks of more aggressive sedation or use of paralytics if needed to achieve the intended tidal volumes. Real-time bedside imaging techniques such as electrical impedance tomography hold some potential to identify overdistension or tidal recruitment with each breath, which could be useful for monitoring protective ventilation and to individualize ventilator strategy.",

PEEP (5-20 cmH 2 O) is a key element of protective ventilation 91 and is routinely applied in all patients with ARDS to facilitate adequate oxygenation and maintain alveolar recruitment. The ideal PEEP might be sufficiently high to prevent cyclic opening and collapse of distal airspaces during tidal ventilation yet low enough to avoid tidal overdistension. Unfortunately, there is still not a reliable method to assess at the bedside the risk-to-benefit ratio of different PEEP levels in individual patients. Titrating PEEP to offset oesophageal pressure, a surrogate of pleural pressure, showed promise in a single-centre study 160 , but the results from a follow-up multicentre trial indicate no benefit for clinical outcomes for titrating PEEP by an oesophagealguided strategy, compared with empirical high PEEP in patients with moderate or severe ARDS 161 . No multicentre clinical trials to date have definitively shown that any one PEEP titration strategy provides superior patient-centred outcomes [162] [163] [164] . However, in accordance with data from studies assessing lung recruitability with CT scan 156 , a meta-analysis of these trials suggests that higher levels of PEEP might be preferable in moderate or severe ARDS but not in patients with mild ARDS 165 .",

In 2006, a randomized clinical trial in 1,000 patients with ARDS demonstrated that adopting a fluid-conservative approach after vasopressor-dependent shock had resolved led to an increase in ventilator-free days and improved oxygenation index 185 . In the trial, the fluid-conservative arm was guided by a detailed algorithm that required measurement of central venous or pulmonary arterial wedge pressure measurements every 4 hours to determine the use of diuretics to achieve lower vascular filling pressures. Since that trial, a simplified fluid-conservative approach has been recommended to reduce overall fluid balance by 500-1,000 ml per day in patients with ARDS who no longer have shock by reducing intravenous fluids and using diuretics. In the presence of haemodynamic instability, transpulmonary thermodilution estimation of extravascular lung water could help identify risk of exacerbating pulmonary oedema with a volume challenge, potentially helping inform resuscitation. Some have cautioned against overly conservative fluid management, citing a small study that suggested that a fluid-conservative strategy might be associated with long-term cognitive impairment; however, methodological issues, potential survivorship bias and underpowering limit definitive conclusions 185, 186 . This trial also demonstrated no value in using a pulmonary arterial catheter compared with a central venous fluid catheter to guide fluid management, as mentioned above 121 . No randomized controlled trial has assessed con servative fluid therapy in children with ARDS, but one observational study indicated that elevated cumulative fluid balance on day 3 of PARDS was associated with higher mortality, especially in patients with concomitant acute kidney injury 187 .",

Early reports postulated these decrements might be due to exercise limitation from residual pulmonary function abnormalities [212] [213] [214] . Later studies combined pulmonary and functional outcome measures with QOL assessments, observing that both pulmonary function and self-perceived overall health gradually improve through 6 months after the acute illness. However, the severity of disability was not wholly explained by changes in pulmonary function or respiratory symptoms 215 . The aetiology of this reported dysfunction was uncertain. A later study combined measures of pulmonary function with an evaluation of quality-adjusted life years using the Quality of Well-Being Scale (a general health questionnaire that measures well-being over the previous 3 days in terms of physical activities, social activities, mobility and symptoms) and found that ARDS survivors had poor quality-adjusted survival associated with an important illness burden. Again, the specific contributors to this dysfunction remained unclear 216 .",

With more detailed follow-up evaluations, these investigators observed that survivors of ARDS had significant exercise limitation and poor physical QOL at 1-year follow-up related to marked muscle wasting and weakness; myriad physical disabilities including heterotopic ossification, joint contractures and tracheal stenosis; and cosmetic concerns related to scarring at tracheostomy, central line or chest tube sites. This study focused attention on muscle dysfunction as a major morbidity after ARDS and served to highlight the prevalence and persistence of medical complexity after critical illness 217 . This same group of investigators continued follow-up to 5 years after ARDS and noted persistence of disability and compromised QOL, which were associated with increased cost and health-care use 218 .

The alveolar epithelium is a continuous monolayer of alveolar type I (ATI) cells (very thin cells that permit gas exchange) and alveolar type II (ATII) cells (which produce surfactant to enable lung expansion with a low surface tension); both cells transport ions and fluid from the alveolus to maintain dry airspaces. The intact alveolar epithelium is linked by intercellular tight junctions. Tight junctions are responsible for barrier function and regulating the movement of fluid and ions across the epithelium and are composed of transmembrane claudins and occludins and cytoplasmic zonula occludens (ZO) proteins that anchor tight junctions to the actin cytoskeleton. Alveolar epithelial cells express plasma membrane E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin. \u03b2-Catenin also functions as a transcriptional cofactor and has a role in cell turnover in the subset of ATII cells that function as stem cells during homeostasis 80 . Endothelial cells serve to regulate the influx of fluid and inflammatory cells into the interstitial space and are connected by intercellular junctions comprising tight junctions and adherens junctions. Adherens junctions contain vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), which mediates cell-cell contact through its extracellular domain and has a key role in barrier function. p120-catentin binds to and stabilizes VE-cadherin, which is linked to the actin cytoskeleton via \u03b1-catenin (\u03b1 in the figure) and has multiple additional functional interactions56 . TIE2 acts in concert with vascular endothelial-protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP), which dephosphorylates VE-cadherin, stabilizing it. Normally , transvascular flux of fluid out of the capillary moves water and low-molecular-weight solutes into the interstitial space and then into the lymphatics; in health, this fluid does not cross the epithelial barrier. Resident alveolar macrophages populate the airspaces, providing host defence. Large numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) reside in the alveolar capillaries and can be rapidly mobilized to the airspaces in the setting of infection. \u03b2, \u03b2-catenin; BASC, bronchioalveolar stem cell; ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; JAM, junctional adhesion molecule; RBC, red blood cell.",

In acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), features of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), such as in the acute 'exudative' phase (~7 days) (panel a), are typically followed by alveolar type II (ATII) cell hyperplasia and interstitial fibrosis in a 'proliferative' phase. Eosinophilic depositions termed hyaline membranes are defining features of DAD (pink structure lining the central alveolus, indicated by the arrowhead in panel b) are defining features of DAD. Leukocytes are embedded in the hyaline membranes (arrows in panel b). Electron microscopic analyses (panel c) demonstrate that alterations in endothelial and epithelial cells are critical features of acute alveolar injury in ARDS 37,46 . Focal epithelial destruction of alveolar type I (ATI) cells and denudation of the alveolar basement membrane occur early in ARDS, whereas endothelial continuity is preserved with modest alterations in most cases.
