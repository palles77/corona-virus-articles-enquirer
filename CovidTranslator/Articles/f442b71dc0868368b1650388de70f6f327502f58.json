The influence of an upstream interfering building may significantly modify the indoor airflow characteristics of the wind-induced natural ventilated downstream interfered building. Motivated by the findings in previous studies, namely that infectious respiratory aerosols exhausted from a unit can re-enter into another unit in the same building through building envelope openings, this study investigates the inter-unit pollutant dispersion around a multi-story building in two wind directions by employing the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The CFD model employed in this study has been validated against previous experimental data. The results show that the presence of an upstream building greatly changes the path lines around the downstream target building and the pollutant transportation routes around it. The presence of a low upstream building also greatly increases the average air exchange rate (ACH) values and the pollutant reentry ratios (R k ) below the source unit on the windward side of the downstream target building for normal wind incidence. However, the presence of a high upstream building greatly increases the average ACH values on the windward side and increases the R k on the leeward side of the downstream building for oblique wind incidence.",

            "text": "Apart from outdoor air pollutants, airborne pollutants released from an indoor environment may also re-enter to adjacent units through open windows, posing a risk of infection, as occurred in the cross-transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong in the spring of 2003 (Li et al., 2004) . In densely populated urban areas like Hong Kong, residential buildings usually have a single opening to achieve single-sided natural ventilation. A large number of studies have been conducted based on models with this type of natural ventilation to investigate the mechanisms of indoor pollutant transportation between two units in the same building due to both buoyancy and wind effect (Li et al., 2004; Niu and Tung, 2008; Mak, 2014, 2015a; Cui et al., 2014) . Li et al. (2004) conducted a detailed analysis of the airborne transmission route in the residential estate Amoy Garden, where the largest number of SARS case occurred. They found that: (a) airborne viruses have high infection rates between adjacent units in residential buildings due to the quick evaporation of Tominaga et al., 2008) . These studies reveal that the presence of proximity surrounding buildings dramatically reduces the air exchange rate (ACH) and pollutant exchange rate (PCH) around buildings (Ai and Mak, 2015b; Vardoulakis et al., 2003) . Among surrounding buildings, the influence of an upstream building on its downstream building was paid particular attention, as it reduces significantly the external wind speeds (Zhang and Gu, 2008; Tominaga and Stathopoulos, 2011; Chang and Meroney, 2003) and curtails the pollutant dispersion around the downstream building . The dimensions of an upstream building, especially its height, directly determine the size of the recirculation zone in the wake (ASHRAE, 2007; Fackrell and Pearce, 1981) . However, previous studies regarding two upstream-downstream buildings focus mainly on the external airflow and pollutant dispersion around buildings, whereas the indoor airflow and pollutant dispersion were paid less attention.",

The wind tunnel is 14 m long and has a cross-section area of 3.0 \u00c2 2.0 m 2 . The atmospheric boundary layer is generated by a combination of long fetch of upwind terrain, with spires and roughness elements on the floor. As shown in Based on the best practice guidelines proposed by Franke et al. (2007) , a computational domain with an upstream distance of 5H, downstream distance of 15H, lateral distance of 5H, and height of 6H is chosen. The mesh of 2.08 million cells consists of a hybrid grid with prismatic and hexahedral cells (see Fig. 2 ). As each walladjacent cell's centroid should be located in the logarithmic layer when employing a standard wall function, the near-wall y\u00fe value should range between 30 and 300 (Fluent, 2010b) . The y\u00fe values in the vicinity of the building surfaces and domain ground in this validation are all between 30 and 40.",

Two 3D steady RANS turbulence models, standard k-\u03b5 and RNG k-\u03b5, are adopted in the validated simulation. The SIMPLE algorithm is used for pressure-velocity coupling, pressure interpolation is secondorder, and second-order discretization schemes are used for both the convection and viscous terms of the governing equations. Convergence is assumed to obtain when all the scaled residuals level off and reach a minimum of 10 \u00c0 6 for x, y, z momentum, and 10 \u00c0 5 for k, \u03b5, and continuity.

Compared to the experimental data, the average deviations of the C p values produced by the standard k-\u03b5 model and the RNG model are 28.57% and 6.21%, respectively, on the windward side, and \u00c0 12.08% and \u00c0 19.19% on the leeward side. Obviously, the results of the RNG model have better agreements with the wind tunnel data. Moreover, the RNG model produces a more accurate recirculation zone in the wake of the target building than the standard k-\u03b5 model. The better performance of RNG model over the original standard model can be attributed to the many improvements built in the RNG model (Murakami and Mochida, 1988; Chavez et al., 2011) . In addition, the C p values predicted in the present study are closer to those predicted by the experimenters (Zhang and Gu, 2008) , which indicates that the boundary conditions used are generally acceptable. Note that this validation compares only the results on the windward and leeward facades asthis paper focuses on the ventilation and pollutant dispersion through openings on the windward and leeward facades. Overall, this validation justifies the use of these selected numerical methods (RNG model) in the later simulations of airflow and inter-unit dispersion around two buildings.",

Two upstream interfering building heights are considered, namely one equal to D z and another equal to 2D z . The distance between the two buildings equal to the width of the building (6 m in prototype) which is smaller than the leeward recirculation length (see Table 2 ) of both high and low upstream buildings. A series of similarity criteria should be satisfied in order to reproduce the original full-scale flow. Geometric similarity and boundary layer flow similarity are relatively easy to achieve when appropriate scaled model, computational domain, and boundary conditions are selected. The computational domain for all the cases is a rectangular box surrounding the target building (see Fig. 5 ) to simulate the natural ventilation, and the domain boundaries are sufficient to achieve the correct airflow around the buildings with the same ratio as the validation in Section 2.2. Meroney's (2004) detailed review of the Reynolds number Re (Re\u00bcV ref D z /\u03bd) under purely wind-induced conditions indicated that the turbulent flow would be similar at all high Reynolds numbers greater than a threshold of 15,000. In addition, for the modeling of plumes interacting with structures, the similarity criteria are affected by source location, building orientation, and measurement location. The non-dimensional pollutant concentration distributions on a building surface could vary with wind speed until the R e is larger than 3000. In this work, the wind speed at the height of building roof is 4 m/s, resulting in a R e of at least 4 \u00c2 10 4 . This Re is much larger than the threshold value suggested by Meroney (2004) , suggesting that Reynolds independence is fulfilled. Niu and Tung (2008) concluded that under the condition with an indoor-and-outdoor difference of 3 to 5\u00b0C and a wind speed above 0.9 m/s, the thermally driven force of pollutant dispersion in the current building configurations can be ignored. Furthermore, natural ventilation is usually adopted in the seasons when the indoor-and-outdoor temperature difference is small. Thus, this study only considers the wind effect on natural ventilation and pollutant dispersion. Six cases are built to study the effect of an upstream building on the inter-unit dispersion of the downstream target building under different wind directions (see Table 3 ).",

The air flow path lines (Oke, 1978) . of an isolated building (see Fig. 6a ) are basically similar to those shown in Fig. 4 . Influenced by the upstream buildings, air mainly flows downward near the windward side of the downstream target building because of the presence of a low upstream building (Fig. 6b) . Such a change in the near-wall flow pattern implies that the presence of a low upstream building may have an effect on the inter-unit pollutant dispersion route. For example, when pollutants are released from the stagnation area, their transportation route will follow the air flows and change from downward and upward totally into downward. Fig. 7 shows the air flow streamlines on the horizontal plane at the breathing level on the third floor of the downstream target building (Z\u00bc 0.37 m) for each case. For an isolated building, air flows separately into the lateral side, which means that the pollutant released from the windward units will be diluted quickly (Fig. 7a) . However, the presence of the upstream buildings causes two recirculation zones to occur on the windward side of the downstream building as it is located in the leeward cavity of the upstream buildings (Fig. 7b, Fig. 7c ). In addition, the high upstream building has a larger recirculation than the low upstream building, which extended to the windward surface of the downstream target building (Fig. 7c) , but there is no dominant flow in the vertical direction (Fig. 6c) . This implies that the presence of a high upstream building induces more horizontal transportation of pollutants. In order to evaluate the effect of upstream buildings on the pollutant transportation route, the pollutant R k will be calculated and discussed in Section 4.3.",

Fig. 9a shows the profile at the mid-section between the two buildings, while Fig. 9b shows the profile at 1/8 D y from the downstream building. It can be seen that the velocity magnitudes at the mid-section (Fig. 9a ) are greatly reduced, by 75%, under the effect of an upstream building (Case 2 and Case 3), compared to those in Case 1 with no upstream building. However, the velocity magnitudes at close proximity to the windward wall of the downstream building, as shown in Fig. 9b , are relatively unaffected by the presence of an upstream building. The effects of an upstream building on the ventilation rate of every single unit in each case will be discussed further in Section 4.2. Fig. 10 shows the ACH for each unit for the six cases. W indicates a unit on windward side, and L on the leeward side. When wind direction is in normal incidence, the presence of a low upstream building (H\u00bc D z ) significantly improves the ACH values of units W2, W3, and W4, especially for the top-most unit (W4), which is located above the stagnation area (70-80% of the height of the target building). The presence of a high upstream building (H \u00bc2D z ) in the same position has only a slight positive effect on the ACH values of each unit. On the leeward side, both low and high upstream buildings have a negative effect on ACH values. When the wind direction is oblique (wind angle \u03b1\u00bc45\u00b0), the ACH values of all units are significantly better than under normal incidence wind direction (wind angle \u03b1\u00bc0\u00b0). Under an oblique wind, the presence of a low upstream building has a negative effect, decreasing the ACH value of all units on both windward and leeward sides, with the exception of W3. However, the presence of a high upstream building increased the ACH values by 140% on average on the downstream target building's windward side, but reduced the ventilation performance of all units on the leeward side (Table 4 ). The presence of a low upstream building undoubtedly influenced the ventilation performance of the downstream building. From the results above, it can be seen that an upstream building and wind direction can totally change the indoor airflow characteristics. The location of a unit is also a very important parameter modifying the indoor ventilation performance. The results show that the presence of a low upstream building increases the ACH of the windward units under a normal incident wind, while the presence of a high upstream building increases the ACH value of windward units under an oblique incident wind (wind angle \u03b1\u00bc45\u00b0). Under both wind directions, both types of upstream building reduce the ventilation performance for leeward units.",

As mentioned in Section 4.1, due to the presence of a low upstream building, the air flow direction in the windward wall stagnation area of the downstream target building changes from separately downward and upward totally into downward. When the pollutant source of an isolated building is located in the stagnation area (W3), the pollutant released from the source unit flows both upward and downward on the windward wall, which means that units W4 and W2 are both affected by the pollutant. However, the presence of a low upstream building changes the near-wall flow direction of the downstream target building. Owing to the recirculation vortex between the two buildings, the pollutant released from Unit W3 is mainly transported downward. As shown in Fig. 11c , owing to the presence of a low upstream building, the R k of Unit W4 decreases from 0.15% to become negligible and the R k of W2 and W1 is increased substantially from 0.30% and negligible to 6.76% and 8.32%, respectively, which is consistent with the flow characteristics introduced before. Similar to the windward wall, the presence of a low upstream building increases the R k of leeward units. The presence of a low upstream building has a negative effect, which turns units W1 and W2 into very dangerous places, in terms of airborne disease control. However, when a high upstream building is present, the R k of all units are negligible, with the exception of W4 and W2. Unit W2 is slightly affected by the high upstream building but the R k of Unit W4 is increased greatly, from 0.15% to 9.90%. Overall, the presence of a high upstream building significantly increases the R k of top-floor units on the windward wall.",

Lastly, when the pollutant source is located above the stagnation area (namely, Unit W4 in the downstream target building), the presence of a low upstream building significantly increases the R k of the windward units, as the leeward recirculation cavity of the low upstream building induces the flow downwards (see Fig. 11d ). The presence of a low upstream building increased the R k of Units W1, W2, and W3 from negligible to 6.46%, 3.92%, and 5.52%, respectively. Like the results on the windward wall, all leeward units' R k are near or more than 2%. The largest R k , 5.52%, occurs in Unit L4.

Under an oblique wind, there are two windward and two leeward walls on each building (see Fig. 7d ), which orient obliquely (\u03b1 \u00bc45\u00b0) to the incident wind but the basic pattern on the building's surfaces remains the same as that under the normal incidence wind (Oke, 1978) . When the wind approaches the buildings, it first reaches the sharp corners and then flows quickly around the leeward side. With such a flow pattern, the pollutant released from the windward units is quickly and effectively diluted into the flow streams. On the leeward sides, the pressure difference leads to two low-pressure recirculation zones, as show in Fig. 7d . These recirculation zones may induce pollutants released from the windward units to re-enter into leeward units. As seen in the results of Case 4, Case 5, and Case 6 shown in Fig. 11 , under an oblique wind, the R k of all windward units are negligible, no matter which unit the pollutants are released from. However, both low and high upstream buildings increase the pollutant R k of units on the leeward side of the downstream target building.",
