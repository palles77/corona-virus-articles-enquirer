When zoonotic IAVs enter the human population, the viral 26 hemagglutinin (HA) requires adaptation to achieve sustained virus transmission. In 27 contrast, IBV has been circulating in humans, its only host, for a long period of time. 28 Whether this entailed adaptation of IBV HA to the human airways is unknown. To address 29 this question, we compared seasonal IAV (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and IBV viruses 30 (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineage) with regard to host-dependent activity of HA as the 31 mediator of membrane fusion during viral entry. We first investigated proteolytic activation 32 of HA, by covering all type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) and kallikrein 33 enzymes, many of which proved present in human respiratory epithelium. Compared to 34 IAV, the IBV HA0 precursor is cleaved by a broader panel of TTSPs and activated with 35 much higher efficiency. Accordingly, knockdown of a single protease, TMPRSS2, was 36 sufficient to abrogate spread of IAV but not IBV in human respiratory epithelial cells. 37 Second, the HA fusion pH proved similar for IBV and human-adapted IAVs (one exception 38 being HA of 1918 IAV). Third, IBV HA exhibited higher expression at 33\u00b0C, a temperature 39 required for membrane fusion by B/Victoria HA. This indicates pronounced adaptation of 40 IBV HA to the mildly acidic pH and cooler temperature of human upper airways. These 41 distinct and intrinsic features of IBV HA are compatible with extensive host-adaptation 42 during prolonged circulation of this respiratory virus in the human population. 43 2 All rights reserved.

Gene reassortment between the two lineages is common yet 66 not seen for the HA, PB1 and PB2 gene segments (7). Whereas IAV is widespread in 67 birds and mammals (8), IBV is restricted to humans with no sustained animal reservoir (9) 68 and only rare spillover events (10). When a zoonotic IAV enters the human population, 69 adaptive changes in multiple viral proteins are required to achieve sustained human-to-70 human transmissibility (11). Which adaptive features were acquired by IBV as a result of 71 its long existence in humans has hardly been investigated (9). 72 73 One major protein involved in this host adaptation is the viral hemagglutinin (HA), the 74 mediator of viral entry (12, 13). HA binds to sialylated glycans on the cell surface to enable 75 virus uptake by endocytosis. Next, HA mediates fusion of the viral envelope and 76 endosomal membrane, allowing release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. 77 Membrane fusion occurs when virus-containing endosomes mature from early (pH ~6) to 78 4 All rights reserved.

To gain membrane fusion-competence, HA relies on 80 host cell proteases for posttranslational cleavage of the HA0 precursor into two 81 polypeptides, HA1 and HA2, a process termed priming or activation (15). In human IAV 82 and IBV strains, HA0 has a monobasic (single arginine) cleavage site that is recognized 83 by trypsin-like serine proteases. Understanding the protease dependency of HA might 84 reveal biological differences between IAV and IBV, and direct drug concepts to target 85 these proteases for influenza therapy (16, 17). A series of proteases have been proposed 86 for IAV (reviewed by B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al. (18)), but for IBV hardly any 87 information is available. The type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) TMPRSS2 88 (transmembrane protease serine 2) is an activator of IAV HA0 in cell culture and essential 89 for IAV replication in mice, at least for some IAV subtypes (19-22). In humans, a gene 90 polymorphism leading to higher TMPRSS2 expression was correlated with the risk for 91 developing severe influenza (23). In cell culture, IAV can also be activated by some other 92 TTSPs and kallikreins, but which of these support spread of IAV in human airways remains 93 to be demonstrated [reviewed in: (16, 24)]. Regarding IBV, TMPRSS2 was shown to 94 cleave IBV HA0 (17) and mediate virus spread in some human airway cell culture models 95 (25), however this protease appeared dispensable for IBV pathogenesis in mice (26). 96 Hence, the protease recognition profile of IBV HA is largely unknown. 97 98 Two other adaptive features of HA are related to its pH-and temperature-dependence. 99 Again, data for IBV are very limited. Successful virus replication and transmission require 100 a balance between the low pH that triggers HA refolding and membrane fusion during viral 101 entry, and acid-stability of progeny virus in the respiratory tract and environment (27, 28). 102 5 All rights reserved.

Studies in ferrets showed that increased IAV HA 106 acid-stability contributes to airborne transmissibility (31, 33, 34). In addition, human 107 airways exhibit a temperature gradient, from ~30-32\u00b0C in the nasal mucosa (35), to ~32\u00b0C 108 in the upper trachea and ~36\u00b0C in the bronchi (36).

            "text": "The global burden of seasonal influenza is estimated at 3 to 5 million severe cases (1) 57 and 290,000-650,000 fatalities per year (2). In addition, influenza A virus (IAV) causes 58 sporadic pandemics with an even more severe impact on public health. Influenza B virus 59 (IBV) does not cause pandemics but is responsible for a significant proportion of seasonal 60 influenza (3). IBV may account for 22-44% of influenza deaths in children (3) To understand how these human airway-specific factors may influence the membrane 117 fusion activity of HA, we here compared the HA proteins of four seasonal human IAV and 118 IBV viruses. Their proteolytic activation was analyzed by covering all members of the 119 human TTSP (39) and kallikrein (KLK) families (40). We demonstrate that IBV HA exhibits 120 much more efficient activation by a broad range of airway proteases, explaining why 121 TMPRSS2 alone was required for spread of IAV but not IBV in human respiratory epithelial 122 cells. Whereas the HA proteins of IBV and human IAV showed similar low pH-dependence 123 to trigger membrane fusion, a distinction was seen in terms of temperature dependence, 124 with IBV HA having clear preference for 33\u00b0C. For one of the two IBV lineages, this cooler 125 temperature was required to achieve membrane fusion. We propose that these distinct 126 IBV HA0 is efficiently cleaved by a broad range of TTSPs 149 To investigate which of these proteases can activate the HA proteins of IAV or IBV, 150 expression plasmids were generated for all 18 human TTSPs and 16 KLKs, bearing a C-151 terminal flag tag (for details see Table S1 ). When we analyzed expression in transfected 152 cells, most proteases showed a protein level similar to that of TMPRSS2 regarded as the 153 reference (Fig. S1C ). For TMPRSS11B, TMPRSS12, TMPRSS7 and KLK13, expression 154 was three-fold lower. For TMPRSS11D/HAT and TMPRSS11E/DESC1 expression was 155 very weak, meaning that the results from the HA cleavage assay are an underestimate for 156 these two proteases. In this assay, the proteases were co-expressed with the HAs from 157 four seasonal IAV (A/H1 and A/H3) and IBV (B/Yam and B/Vic) viruses ( Fig. 2A ). HA0 158 cleavage was assessed by western blot for the HA1 or HA2 cleavage product, depending 159 on which epitope was recognized by the anti-HA antibody. The % cleaved HA was 160 calculated relative to the trypsin control, consisting of cells transfected with HA plus empty 161 plasmid, and briefly exposed to exogenous trypsin. 162 163 TMPRSS2 was the only protease that efficiently cleaved all four IAV/IBV HA0 proteins 164 tested. It was the only protease with high activity on A/H3 HA0 ( Fig. 2B and 2C ), while 165 A/H1 HA0 was equally well cleaved by TMPRSS4. On the other hand, the two IBV HA0 166 proteins were efficiently processed by four TTSPs (Fig. 2B and 2C ), namely TMPRSS11F, 167 TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and TMPRSS13/MSPL. Besides, IBV HA0 was cleaved by 168 TMPRSS11A and TMPRSS11D/HAT, yet low expression of the latter protease (see 169 above) precluded conclusions on cleavage efficiency. B/Yam HA0 was also recognized none of the kallikreins was found to be a broad HA activator. KLK14 cleaved both IBV 173 proteins, and KLK5 and KLK6 cleaved B/Yam HA0 with low efficacy. In summary, we 174 demonstrated that, compared to its IAV counterpart, IBV HA0 can use a broader panel of 175 TTSPs for efficient proteolytic cleavage. 176 177 All HA0-cleaving TTSPs generate membrane fusion-competent IBV HA 178 We next examined whether HA0 cleavage translates into HA activation. We first employed 179 a polykaryon assay (Fig. 3A) in which HeLa cells that co-express HA and protease, are 193 To verify that the TTSPs activate HA for membrane fusion during viral entry, we employed 194 a retroviral pseudotyping system (Fig. 4A ). Each HA was combined with its cognate 195 neuraminidase (NA) to assure efficient particle release (43, 44) . Pseudoparticles were 196 produced in the presence or absence of TTSPs, treated with PBS or trypsin and then 197 examined for their ability to transduce target cells (Fig. 4A ). In Fig. 4B and 4C, the colored 198 bars show transduction efficiency of TTSP-activated particles, whereas the white bars 199 show total particle infectivity upon additional treatment with trypsin. control. This superior activation of the IBV particles was also evident from the observation 212 that subsequent trypsin treatment gave a lower signal increase for the IBV compared to 213 the IAV particles (see white bars in Fig. 4B Table S5 ) replication in Calu-3 cells was the same whether trypsin was added or not (P-245 value > 0.1, Fig. S3 ), meaning that these cells express one or more HA0-activating 246 proteases. The four viruses were similarly inhibited by three serine protease inhibitors 247 (see antiviral EC50 values in Table S5 ; a brief description of the assay is provided below 248 this Table) but were not blocked by a furin inhibitor, consistent with furin's inability to 249 process monobasic HA0 cleavage sites (41). We also observed no effect with inhibitors 250 of lysosomal cathepsins, which activate some unrelated viruses that enter by endocytosis 251 (51). Thus, HA activation in Calu-3 cells relies on one or more serine proteases. TMPRSS2 and the most efficacious IBV HA activators identified above (Fig. 5D ). Hence, 264 the spread of IBV appears to rely on redundant proteases, concurring with the above 265 findings that, besides TMPRSS2, several proteases effectively activate the IBV HA 266 protein. 269   cells   270   To assess whether some TTSPs might stand out as activators of IBV, we included Madin-271 Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells which, alike Calu-3 cells, support replication of IBV in 272 the absence of trypsin (52). This observation was also made for 1918 IAV (50, 53) which, 273 in this regard, is unique among human IAV strains. Indeed, our seasonal IBV but not IAV 274 viruses did not require exogenous trypsin to replicate in MDCK cells (Fig. 6A ). HA0 275 cleavage during IBV replication was inhibited by the broad serine protease inhibitor 276 camostat ( Fig. 6B) , hence executed by one or more proteases of this family. mRNA 277 quantification in MDCK cells (see Table S3 for dog-specific primers) revealed abundant 278 expression of ST14/matriptase, as observed before (54, 55) and TMPRSS4 (Fig. 6C ). 279 Another study (50) found no TMPRSS4 mRNA in MDCK cells, potentially related to the 280 use of different MDCK cell lines (56). Canine TMPRSS4 was cloned into an expression 281 plasmid to investigate its HA0-cleaving capacity. Canine TMPRSS4 proved a strong 282 activator for IBV HA, and more effective on A/H1 HA from 1918 IAV compared to 2009 283 pandemic (Virg09) IAV (Fig. 6D ). The lowest efficiency was seen for A/H3 HA. The 284 polykaryon assay confirmed that fusion-competent HA was formed (pictures in Fig. 6D ). 285 The mRNA data suggested that canine TMPRSS4 or ST14/matriptase might be 286 responsible for spread of IBV in MDCK cells. For IAV HA, published data on the role of 287 matriptase are not consistent (55, 57, 58) . Although our data thus far argued against a 288 direct role for matriptase, an indirect role (e.g. as an activator of TMPRSS4) could not be 289 excluded. With this is mind, we performed knockdown for canine TMPRSS4 and 290 matriptase individually or in combination ( Fig. 6E and 6F ). Knockdown efficiency was 291 >85% based on RT-qPCR for mRNA. Virus replication and HA0 cleavage in IBV-infected 292 MDCK cells proved unaffected by knockdown of TMPRSS4, matriptase, nor a 293 combination of the two (Fig. 6F) . Thus, both in Calu-3 and MDCK cells, IBV does not seem 294 to rely on one single protease for its replication. Cleavage of HA0 into HA1-HA2 activates the protein for membrane fusion, but also 298 renders HA susceptible to inactivation at acidic pH. The human nasal cavity is mildly acidic 299 (average pH: 6.3 in healthy adults and 5.9 in children) (30, 59). For pandemic IAV, 300 acquirement of a more acid-stable HA is considered a prerequisite to achieve human-to-301 human transmissibility (27, 31, 43, 60) . Since IBV is restricted to humans, we asked 302 whether IBV possesses an acid-stable HA. Indeed, the polykaryon assay showed that the On the other hand, the shape of the pH curves was distinct for IBV HA. For human-307 adapted IAV HAs, the curves showed a discrete pH value at which the number of 308 polykaryons was maximal, and a steep decline at more acidic pH due to HA inactivation 309 (63). In contrast, both IBV HAs produced high numbers of polykaryons over the entire low 310 pH range. Hence, IBV HA is triggered for fusion at a similar acidic pH as IAV HA, however 311 the IBV protein may be more resistant to acidic conditions. Besides, we noticed that 1918 312 A/H1 HA (Fig. 7D ) had the highest fusion pH among the tested human IAV HAs, its value 313 (5.7) being as high as that of avian A/H5 HA (Fig. 7E ). This might explain the superior 314 transduction efficiency of 1918 IAV pseudoparticles (see above), since an increased 315 fusion pH enables earlier endosomal escape and more efficient infection (28). 316 15 All rights reserved.

However, the 341 mutation did not change the 33\u00b0C preference for protein expression and membrane fusion 342 ( Fig. 8B-D) , indicating that this N248 glycan is not responsible for the temperature-343 sensitive phenotype of B/Vic HA. 344 Accordingly, pseudoparticles carrying B/Vic HA produced at 33\u00b0C had much higher 345 infectivity compared to those generated at 37\u00b0C (P-value < 0.0001, Fig. 9B ). Transduction The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. In order to be membrane fusion-competent, HA requires cleavage by a host cell protease. 365 Several TTSPs and KLKs have been linked to IAV HA activation (reviewed in (18)), yet a 366 comprehensive analysis was, thus far, missing for IAV and especially for IBV. To close 367 this gap, we compared all 18 human TTSP and 16 KLK enzymes for their capacity to 368 cleave and activate the IAV and IBV HA proteins. Our results confirm the leading role of 369 TMPRSS2 in activation of monobasic IAV HAs, consistent with data obtained in cell 370 culture, knockout mice or humans (19, 20, 23) . The report that TMPRSS2 proved 371 dispensable for spread of IBV in mice (26) suggested that either TMPRSS2 is not involved 372 at all or several redundant proteases may activate IBV HA. Our findings support the latter 373 assumption, since the cleavability of IBV HA proved clearly superior to that of IAV. We 374 demonstrated that both IBV HA lineages are cleaved and activated by a broad range of 375 (in total ten) TTSP enzymes, the strongest activators being TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, 376 TMPRSS11F, TMPRSS13/MSPL, Hepsin and TMPRSS11D/HAT, followed by four other 377 proteases (TMPRSS5, TMPRSS6, TMPRSS11A and TMPRSS11E/DESC1).

This is also evident from our observation in MDCK cells, in which knockdown 394 of the abundantly expressed TMPRSS4 nor matriptase could halt IBV replication. In 395 contrast, replication of A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses in Calu-3 cells proved strongly 396 dependent on TMPRSS2. This is noteworthy considering that TMPRSS4 efficiently 397 activated A/H1 HA in transfected cells and proved abundantly expressed in Calu-3 cells. 398 How can this central role of TMPRSS2 in activation of IAV HA be explained? Unlike other 399 TTSPs, TMPRSS2 may be present at high levels in all compartments of the constitutive 400 secretory pathway (70) which is also followed by HA.

Why is IBV HA more efficiently activated than IAV HA? It is 403 plausible that IBV HA may exhibit higher TTSP accessibility, perhaps governed by the 404 dynamics of HA glycoprotein folding, maturation, or transport towards the cell membrane. Since the clinical picture of IBV is similar to that of IAV (9), the high cleavability of IBV HA 417 appears not linked to virulence. However, it assures shedding of infectious virus. Human-418 to-human transmissibility also requires optimal HA acid-stability, since this renders the 419 virus more stable under mildly acidic conditions in the human URT or environment (27). 420 For zoonotic IAVs, adaptation to the human host is associated with HA stabilization, 421 reducing the HA fusion pH to 5.2-5.5 (31). This fits with the fusion pH values that we 422 measured for IBV HA, i.e. 5.4 for the B/Victoria and 5.6 for the B/Yamagata lineage. 423 Literature data for IBV are scarce but our values are in agreement with other reports (77, 424 78). The difference in fusion pH between the two lineages appears partially related to the 425 B/Victoria lineage-specific N248 HA head glycan, positioned adjacent to the receptor 426 20 All rights reserved.

Removing this N-glycan caused a small increase in the fusion pH 427 threshold, pointing to an allosteric effect of the HA head domain on the fusion process, 428 which is consistent with a role for receptor binding in fusion peptide dynamics (14) adapted to the proximal airways, given its stricter 33\u00b0C dependence and lower fusion pH. 434 Its more stable HA could perhaps explain higher prevalence of this lineage in children (9) 435 which typically have a more acidic nasal pH (27). A preference for cooler temperature was 436 also reported for the hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) protein of influenza C virus, 437 which mainly infects humans (79). We did not observe this temperature effect for human 438 IAV HAs, and saw the opposite pattern for avian A/H7 HA. This leads us to hypothesize 439 that fine-tuning of HA protein expression to fit the temperature of the host target organs 440 could be another viral adaptation strategy, besides well-known mechanisms related to 441 receptor use, polymerase activity or immune evasion (8). The temperature-sensitive 442 expression of IBV HA is an intrinsic feature seen in the absence of any other IBV proteins, 443 hence it is unrelated to the reduced RNA synthesis seen with some temperature-sensitive 444 IBV strains (80). As for the biochemical basis, for influenza C virus HEF, trimer formation 445 and surface expression proved more efficient at 33\u00b0C than at 37\u00b0C (79). A similar 446 temperature effect probably applies to IBV HA, since pseudoparticles carrying B/Vic HA 447 contained much higher HA levels when produced at 33\u00b0C compared to 37\u00b0C. For IAV HA, 448 a link exists between N-glycosylation and temperature sensitivity of the processes of HA 449 folding or transport towards the cell membrane (73, 81-84).

In brief, HEK293T cells were transfected in 6-593 well plates, using calcium phosphate precipitation, with a mixture of plasmids encoding: 594 MLV gag-pol (1.5 \u00b5g); an MLV vector coding for fLuc (3 \u00b5g); HA-and NA-expression 595 plasmids (both 0.75 \u00b5g); plus the protease expression plasmids specified above (0.125 596 \u00b5g). The two additional expression vectors pCAGGS-HAT and pCAGGS-DESC1 were 597 described before (71). At 16 h post transfection, the medium was replaced by medium 598 with 2% FCS. At 48 h, the pseudoparticle-containing supernatants were harvested and 599 clarified by centrifugation. To verify that all TTSP conditions contained a similar total 600 number of pseudoparticles, they were subsequently exposed to trypsin. Namely, one half 601 of the supernatant was left untreated and the other half was treated with 20 \u00b5g/ml trypsin 602 for 15 min at 37\u00b0C, after which 20 \u00b5g/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor was added. To measure 603 particle infectivity, HEK293T target cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 604 20,000 cells per well. One day later, the cells were exposed to 100 \u00b5l virus stock, and 6 h 605 later, fresh medium was added. To measure fLuc activity at day 3 post transduction, the 606 cells were lysed for 10 min in 50 \u00b5l cold PBS with 0.5% Triton-X. The lysates were 607 transferred to a white, opaque-walled 96-well plate and, after adding fLuc substrate 608 (Beetle-Juice (PJK) kit), the signal was read in a microplate reader (Plate Chameleon V; 609 Hidex) using MicroWin2000 software (version 4.44; Mikrotek Laborsysteme GmbH). 610 28 All rights reserved.

Varying the temperature during protein expression or membrane 331 fusion (see arrow schemes in Fig. 8B) revealed that the 33\u00b0C requirement was due to 332 inefficient HA expression at 37\u00b0C. Whether cell-cell fusion took place at 33\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C 333 made no difference. Due to low expression at 37\u00b0C, the levels of activated HA, generated 334 by trypsin, were undetectable (Fig. 8D). The strict 33\u00b0C requirement was not seen with 335 B/Yam HA, since this protein generated polykaryons at all temperatures, including at 39\u00b0C 336 (Fig. 8B). The HA of the B/Vic lineage carries a globular head glycan at residue N248, that 337 is lacking in the B/Yam lineage (7, 66, 67).

The former 218 virus caused the devastating 1918 pandemic, and its HA protein was identified as a 48). A high case-fatality rate in humans is also seen with avian A/H7N9 IAV, which is 221 feared for its pandemic potential (49). The three A/H1N1 pseudotypes tested, i.e. derived 222 from 1918 IAV, 2009 pandemic virus and the laboratory strain A/PR/8/34 (PR8), as well 223 as the A/H7N9 subtype, shared TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 as the most effective HA-224 activators(Fig. 4C). Hence, whereas TTSP activation was clearly more efficient for IBV 225 compared to IAV pseudotypes, such a difference was not seen for highly virulent versus226 seasonal IAVs. On the other hand, 1918 IAV-pseudoparticles showed 10-and 100-fold 227 higher transduction efficiency than the PR8-and Virg09-pseudotypes, respectively (Fig. S2) Since the three A/H1N1 pseudotypes showed comparable incorporation of HA and 229 MLV gag and a similar level of HA0 cleavage (Fig. S2), the difference might be related to 230 the HA fusion pH (see below) (28). An alternative explanation may be that the 1918 IAV 231 neuraminidase, present on these pseudoparticles, may have enhanced their entry To summarize, these polykaryon and pseudoparticle experiments established ten TTSPs 235 as moderate to strong HA activators. Compared to the IAV proteins, IBV HA exhibits 236 superior activation by a broader range of TTSPs. IBV but not IAV employs several proteases for spread in human airway-derived Since Calu-3 cells show a similar TTSP and KLK expression profile as healthy human 241 lungs (see above), they are a good model to study the role of these proteases in virus 242 activation in the human respiratory tract. For the four IAV/IBV strains, i.e. Virg09 (A/H1N1), HK68 (A/H3N2), Ned05 (B/Yam) and Mal04 (B/Vic), multicycle (i.e. zanamivir-sensitive,",

We saw no evidence for a role of TMPRSS15/enterokinase (Hayashi 2018) or KLK5, KLK12 (68, 69) or any other kallikrein.

Its HA fusion pH 455 (5.7) proved to be exceptionally high for a human IAV but identical to that of highly456 pathogenic avian A/H5N1 virus. This may help to explain the exceptional virulence of 1918 IAV, since IAVs with high HA fusion pH evade interferon control (85) and are more virulent 458 in mice (86). It could also rationalize a mouse study in which the 1918 HA protein by itself 459 generated a highly pathogenic phenotype when introduced in a contemporary backbone 460 virus (46). Besides, we showed that TTSP activation is comparable for 1918 HA and other 461 A/H1 HAs. Hence, the unique capacity of 1918 IAV to replicate in MDCK cells in the 462 absence of trypsin (50, 53) seems not, or at least not entirely, explained by HA activation 463 by TMPRSS4 or another TTSP expressed in MDCK cells.
