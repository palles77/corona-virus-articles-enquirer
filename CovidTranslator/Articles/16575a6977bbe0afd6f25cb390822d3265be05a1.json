Objective We offer a systematic analysis of NASBA design with a view toward expanding its applicability. Methods We examine the parameters that effect dimer formations, and we provide a framework for designing NASBA primers that will reduce false-positive results and make NASBA suitable for more POC diagnostic applications. Then we compare three different oligonucleotide sets to examine (1) the inhibitory effect of dimer formations, (2) false positives with poorly designed primers, and (3) the effect of beacon target location during real-time NASBA. The required T7 promoter sequence adversely affects the reaction kinetics, although the common abridged sequence can improve kinetics without sacrificing accuracy. Results We demonstrate that poorly designed primers undergo real-time exponential amplification in the absence of target RNA, resulting in false positives with a time to half of the peak value (t 1/2 ) of 50 min compared to 45 min for true positives. Redesigning the oligonucleotides to avoid inhibitory dimers eliminated false positives and reduced the true positive t 1/2 by 10 min. Finally, we confirm the efficacy of two molecular beacon design schemes and discuss their multiplexing utility in two clinical scenarios.",

It is routinely used in the clinical diagnosis of many singlestranded RNA viruses, including influenza A [2] , foot-andmouth virus [3, 4] , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), coronavirus [5, 6] , West Nile virus [7] , human bocavirus (HBoV) [8] , and most importantly HIV [9, 10] . NASBA offers the potential for low-cost, portable diagnostic devices, because unlike PCR, NASBA is isothermal. Additionally, NASBA often runs faster than PCR, it compares favorably with regard to sensitivity and convenience [11] , and it is preferred over PCR for clinical HIV samples [10, 12] . Because of advances in microfluidics, NASBA is poised to offer major advantages in sequencebased diagnosis.",

In contrast, inhibitory dimer formations involve non-specific hybridizations characterized by T m values close, equal to, or exceeding the amplification reaction temperature. Of all of the possible dimer formations, the most likely to disturb normal reaction kinetics involves the primer containing the T7 promoter sequence, because this sequence is directly involved in the amplification process.

A negative DG value indicates that the hybridization is energetically favorable, and the T m represents the system in The probe sequences contain an underlined sequence, which hybridizes with P1. The P1 sequences contain the T7 promoter sequence (lower case and bold). The transcribed P1-Probe RNA product hybridizes with P2 (italics). In the HIV-1 oligonucleotide sets, the molecular beacon (italics) competes with P2 to hybridize with the P1-Probe RNA product. In the influenza oligonucleotide set, the molecular beacon (underlined and bold) is designed to be sequence specific and hybridizes with the target region (underlined and bold) of the transcribed P1-Probe RNA product. Molecular beacons contain the fluorophore, 6-FAM, at their 5 0 end and the fluorescence quencher, 3IABlk_FQ, at their 3 0 end Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based Amplification equilibrium at which half of the two oligonucleotides hybridize and the other half remains single stranded. The T7 promoter sequence alone forms a very strong theoretical dimer with itself, even under optimal NASBA conditions. Although the T7 promoter sequence must be used to catalyze T7 RNA polymerase, an abridged version may be used for efficient transcription [19] . The abridged version significantly reduces the hybridization energy (increasing DG) and reduces T m to the point where it would be considered non-inhibitory. The example primer shown in Fig. 3 is from the poorly designed oligonucleotide set (Old) for the NASBA amplification of an HIV-1 K103N sequence. This primer initially is non-inhibitory; however, the addition of the abridged T7 sequence causes an inhibitory dimer formation. This is further exacerbated by the full T7 promoter sequence.",

Table 1 shows these values for all oligonucleotide sets. The poorly designed oligonucleotide set (Old) undergoes inhibitory dimerization during NASBA. The primer 1 (P1) and probe DG and T m values (highlighted grey) show that P1 has a very strong affinity to its intended target probe. P1 also forms a strong self-dimer (highlighted grey and bold), albeit nowhere near as strong as the P1-Probe hybridization. In the presence of large quantities of probe, the P1 dimer will remain non-inhibitory. However, as the concentration of probe decreases, the P1 dimer has a greater inhibitory effect. For negative controls (i.e., no probe), the P1 dimer will become completely dominant.

This is achieved by manually manipulating individual bases in the sequence of P1 so that there are fewer potential adeninethymine and guanine-cytosine hydrogen bonds in the DINAmelt predicted hybridization. The required T7 promoter sequence gives primer 1 inherent minimum DG and T m values that make it susceptible to dimerization. After manipulating the original P1 sequence used, we achieve DG and T m values (Table 1) for the P1 dimer matching those of the abridged T7 promoter sequence dimer alone (DG = -3.7, T m = 22.9\u00b0C); thus, we have designed P1 such that dimerization is as unfavorable as theoretically possible. Although there is a slight decrease in DG and T m for the P1-Probe hybridization, the potential for P1 inhibitory dimerization has been eliminated because the dimers dissociate far below the reaction temperature. Finally, in the H3 influenza set (Table 1) , the P1-P1 dimer dissociates well below the reaction temperature, and P1-Probe hybridization is relatively strong and occurs well above the reaction temperature.",

In design (i), primer 2 is competitive with the molecular beacon to hybridize with the primer 2 RC region, sacrificing reaction kinetics. However, design (i) enables effective multiplexing-an unlimited number of potential target sequences may be used with only one molecular beacon. In design (ii), there is no competition for binding sites. However, because the beacons are targetspecific, one beacon design may only be used for one sequence-specific target. Both beacon system designs have their ideal applications. For example, design (i) is ideal for HIV-1 mutation detection: a large number of HIV-1 mutations impart drug resistance, so it is very important to screen for many mutations in parallel (multiplexing). Although design (i) can target all known mutations, a positive result does not indicate which mutation is present. Design (ii) is ideal for influenza virus sub-typing. This design yields sequence-specific results, indicating which types of influenza are present within a given sample, (H1N1, H3, H5 , etc.), and it avoids premature transcription abortion by the T7 RNA polymerase, which has been observed in previous work [16] .",

While the influenza oligonucleotide set did not offer any significant improvements in predicted hybridization energies compared to the New oligonucleotide set, it did show dramatic improvements in NASBA reaction speed.

Poorly considered primers can not only decrease reaction kinetics, but can also increase the rate of false positives, which is dangerous in the context of clinical HIV testing, for example. Two approaches to primer design significantly improve reaction kinetics and test accuracy-reducing the length of the T7 promoter sequence to the abridged version and reducing the potential number of adenine-thymine and guaninecytosine hydrogen bonds in the primer. Furthermore, effective primer design requires DINAMelt analysis of the bond strength not only between primers and probes, but also between potential dimers and the beacon. A safe approach to improve reaction kinetics is to redesign the probes to avoid dimers at 41\u00b0C, because that is the optimal temperature of the reaction enzymes. Salt ion concentrations may also be altered but have significant implications for all hybridization energies and should not be altered if possible [20] . The application of the NASBA assay is an important design parameter to consider since we have shown that a real-time NASBA system capable of detecting a group of sequences is less efficient than a real-time NASBA system only detecting one target. Successful primer design is not simply a matter of improving the efficiency of NASBA-based clinical assays; it is crucial to their accuracy as well.",
