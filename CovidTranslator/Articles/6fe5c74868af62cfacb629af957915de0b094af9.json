The TC, together with other translation initiation factors and the 40S ribosomal subunit, scans the mRNA for AUG start codons. Upon base pairing of Met-tRNAi to the start codon, eIF2-bound GTP is hydrolyzed and eIF2\u2022GDP is released from the translation complex. To reactivate eIF2, GDP is displaced by eIF2B, a guanidine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). eIF2B is a large decamer composed of a homodimer of a heteropentamer protein complex (4) . The interplay between eIF2 and eIF2B is targeted by the ISR to regulate translation efficiency. In response to stress, eIF2 kinases are activated and subsequently phosphorylate a single, conserved Ser-51 residue in eIF2\u03b1. Four eIF2\u03b1 kinases have been identified: protein kinase R (PKR), which is activated by recognition of \"nonself\" (e.g., viral) RNA (5, 6); PKRlike endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), which responds to an accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER (7); general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2), which is activated by amino acid starvation and UV light (8, 9) ; and heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), which is activated at low levels of heme and exposure to heavy metals (10) . Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 inhibits eIF2B by stabilizing its association with eIF2\u2022GDP (11) . Since the levels of eIF2B levels are low compared with those of eIF2 (12) , limited quantities of P-eIF2\u03b1 can efficiently deplete available eIF2B pools and thus inhibit eIF2Bmediated nucleotide exchange (11) . Impairing eIF2B leads to the general inhibition of protein synthesis and to the aggregation of inactive translation initiation complexes into stress granules (SGs). At the same time, it promotes translation of a selected group of genes, such as ATF4, a transcription factor that promotes cell recovery and survival. These particular mRNAs contain short, upstream openreading frames (uORFs), whose inhibitory function is suppressed when TCs become limiting upon ISR induction.",

Paradoxically, the small-molecule ISR inhibitor ISRIB has promising therapeutic potential in vivo without overt side effects. We demonstrate here that ISRIB inhibits low-level ISR activity, but does not affect strong ISR signaling. We thereby provide a plausible mechanism of how ISRIB counteracts toxic chronic ISR activity, without disturbing the cytoprotective effects of a strong acute ISR. the regulation of translation during mitosis and thereby in cytokinesis and cell proliferation (15) (16) (17) .",

Moreover, there is growing evidence of persistent, smoldering ISR activation in neurodegenerative diseases and conditions exhibiting memory consolidation defects, such as traumatic brain injury (18) (19) (20) (21) . Pharmacological modulation of the ISR has been proposed as a promising therapeutic strategy to treat these neurological conditions that are characterized by chronic eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Recently, a small-molecule ISR inhibitor, ISRIB, was identified to rescue protein translation and prevent SG formation in the presence of P-eIF2\u03b1 (19, 22) . Structural, genetic and biochemical evidence revealed that ISRIB targets eIF2B (23) (24) (25) (26) . ISRIB enhances eIF2B's GEF activity by promoting the assembly of the fully active heterodecameric eIF2B complex from smaller subcomplexes (24, 25) . ISRIB's ability to restore the cellular translational capacity upon ISR activation implicated it as a promising tool to modulate ISR-regulated neurological processes and diseases. Indeed, ISRIB enhances cognitive memory processes (19) , has beneficial effects in prion-diseased mice (27) , and remedies cognitive defects resulting from brain injuries (21) .

We observed that ISRIB suppressed the ISR early in infection, when the amount of viral dsRNA and the level of P-eIF2\u03b1 were relatively low, but not late in infection, when dsRNA and P-eIF2\u03b1 levels were relatively high. This prompted us to investigate more systematically ISRIB's ability to rescue translation at varying levels of P-eIF2\u03b1. To this end, we treated cells with different concentrations of poly(I:C) or arsenite, which trigger the ISR by activating PKR or HRI, respectively. The results show that ISRIB inhibits the ISR when P-eIF2\u03b1 levels are below a critical threshold (i.e., 45-70% of the maximum phosphorylation), but not when P-eIF2\u03b1 levels exceed this threshold level. These findings are consistent with in vitro studies (24) and demonstrate that potentially negative effects of pharmacological eIF2B assembly may be sidestepped under conditions of enhanced phosphorylation of eIF2. The observation that ISRIB is only functional within a narrow range of P-eIF2\u03b1 concentrations may explain the lack of toxic side effects that ISRIB displays in vivo.",

Picornaviruses, like other RNA viruses, synthesize dsRNA in an indispensable intermediate step of their replication process. These dsRNAs are detected by PKR to activate the ISR and limit the production of viral proteins. As a countermeasure, many viruses have evolved strategies to delay or suppress this antiviral response. We set out to test the ability of ISRIB to inhibit the ISR during infection with a recombinant encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) containing debilitating mutations in a zinc-finger domain of its Leader protein, the viral protein that serves as PKR antagonist (EMCV-L Zn ) (32, 33) . To assess the effect of ISRIB on the ISR in virus-infected cells, we treated HeLa-R19 cells with ISRIB for 1 h from 5 h postinfection (p.i.) until 6 h p.i. and monitored active translation using a ribopuromycilation assay for 15 min at the 6-h time point p.i. (34) . This time point is relatively late in the infection cycle, as a single round of replication of this virus takes only 6-8 h (Fig. 1A ). Viral dsRNA replication intermediates are readily detected at \u223c4 h p.i. and reach a maximum level at \u223c6 h p.i. (Fig. 1B) . As a positive control, we treated cells with 50 \u03bcM sodium arsenite, a commonly used method to trigger the ISR via HRI activation (35, 36) . In both arsenite-treated and virus-infected cells, we observed eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and concomitant translational repression.",

To test this notion, we monitored the effects of ISRIB on SG formation in EMCV-L Zn -infected cells at earlier time points p.i., when smaller amounts of dsRNA were present. ISRIB suppressed SG formation at the earliest time point at which SGs were detected (4 h p.i.) but not later in infection ( Fig.  2A) , suggesting that ISRIB's ability to antagonize the ISR indeed depends on the concentration of the stress trigger. We next quantified intracellular P-eIF2\u03b1 levels by flow cytometry. Indeed, the level of P-eIF2\u03b1 in virus-infected cells increased gradually from 3 to 6 h p.i. (Fig. 2B) , correlating with the timing of dsRNAs accumulation ( Fig. 1B ) and the appearance of SGs ( Fig. 2A) . Furthermore, our data indicated that a plateau level of P-eIF2\u03b1 was reached late in infection (5-6 h p.i.). To rule out that this observed maximum level of P-eIF2\u03b1 was caused by a detection limit of our flow cytometry approach, we compared flow cytometry (SI Appendix, intensity ratios of P-eIF2\u03b1 and (total) eIF2\u03b1 in cell lysates to those of purified eIF2\u03b1 samples containing known percentages of P-eIF2\u03b1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 ), we furthermore showed that this upper limit of P-eIF2\u03b1 levels (defined as 100% P-eIF2\u03b1) represents almost complete phosphorylation of the cellular eIF2\u03b1 pool. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the maximum level of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation observed under harsh stress conditions represents the upper limit of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation that was reached. Taken together, the data suggest that during EMCV-L Zn infection, increasing concentrations of dsRNA cause the level of P-eIF2\u03b1 to gradually increase until it reaches a plateau level from \u223c5 h p.i. onwards. At these high P-eIF2\u03b1 levels, ISRIB no longer antagonized the ISR. Upon further increasing the ISRIB concentration (up to 1,600 nM), ISRIB still failed to suppress the ISR (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 ). By contrast, up to \u223c4 h p.i. when P-eIF2\u03b1 levels were \u223c35% of the maximal level, ISRIB potently suppressed the ISR in infected cells.",

Hence, we could not exclude that some virus-induced change(s) in one way or the other affected the ISRIB's ability to suppress the ISR in infected cells. To provide more direct support for the link between the level of P-eIF2\u03b1 and the ability of ISRIB to counteract the dsRNA-induced ISR, we next tested the efficacy of ISRIB in cells transfected with increasing concentrations of poly(I:C), a dsRNA mimic that-like EMCV-L Zn infection-triggers the PKR branch of the ISR (Fig.  3) . In the absence of ISRIB, we observed SG formation in cells transfected with 0.25 ng of poly(I:C) or more. ISRIB prevented SG formation only in cells transfected with relatively low poly(I:C) concentrations (1 ng or less) but not when larger amounts of poly(I:C) were used (Fig. 3A) . At the highest concentration of poly(I:C) at which ISRIB could counteract the ISR (i.e., 1 ng), the P-eIF2\u03b1 level was \u223c45% of the maximum (Fig. 3B) . Transfection of 2 ng of poly(I:C) induced >70% of the maximum P-eIF2\u03b1 concentration and rendered ISRIB ineffective. Together, these data suggest that a threshold level of P-eIF2\u03b1 exists in the range of 45-70% of the maximum, above which ISRIB can no longer antagonize the ISR.",

Thus far, we tested ISRIB in cells exposed to EMCV-L Zn infection or poly(I:C) transfection, both of which induce the ISR via activation of the dsRNA sensor PKR. Since ISRIB acts downstream of P-eIF2\u03b1, we expected similar results irrespective of which stress sensor was activated. To provide further support for this notion, we used multiple arsenite concentrations to induce HRI-mediated ISR activation. Again, we correlated the ability of ISRIB to counteract SG formation (Fig. 4A) to P-eIF2\u03b1 levels (Fig.  4B ). In the absence of ISRIB, SG formation was observed in cells treated with 50 \u03bcM arsenite or more. The presence of ISRIB increased the arsenite concentration required to induce SG formation to 200 \u03bcM or more (Fig. 4A) . The highest arsenite concentration at which ISRIB blocked SG formation (100 \u03bcM) resulted in \u223c40% of the maximum P-eIF2\u03b1 level. At 200 \u03bcM arsenite, which induced \u223c75% P-eIF2\u03b1, ISRIB showed no effect.

By analyzing translation efficiency and stress granule formation in HeLa or U2OS cells infected with a recombinant picornavirus lacking its PKR antagonist, we showed that ISRIB inhibited the ISR early in infection, when levels of viral dsRNA and P-eIF2\u03b1 were relatively low, but not at later time points when levels of dsRNA and P-eIF2\u03b1 were high. To extend this observation, we performed a detailed analysis of the P-eIF2\u03b1 levels and the ability of ISRIB to inhibit the ISR upon treatment of HeLa cells with varying concentrations of poly(I:C) or arsenite. We found that the level of P-eIF2\u03b1 correlated with the concentration of stress trigger used but reached a plateau under severe stress conditions. Thus, the extent of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is graduated, quantitatively reflecting the severity of the stress situation. Importantly, the P-eIF2\u03b1 concentration continued to increase even beyond the concentration necessary to suppress protein synthesis. Irrespective of the stress inducer used, ISRIB antagonized the ISR only when P-eIF2\u03b1 levels were below a critical threshold. This threshold was determined to be somewhere between 45% and 70% of the maximum P-eIF2\u03b1 level that could be observed in HeLa cells and was similar in cells infected with virus, transfected with poly(I:C), or treated with arsenite. Using an ATF4 reporter cell line, we also showed that ISRIB failed to block the expression of stress-induced proteins in the presence of high intracellular P-eIF2\u03b1 levels.

Importantly, this threshold level of P-eIF2\u03b1 appeared independent of the stress trigger, and hence of the eIF2\u03b1 kinase involved. These data are in line with published in vitro data showing that ISRIB increased the GEF activity of eIF2B in the presence of P-eIF2, but failed to do so when the P-eIF2:eIF2 ratio was increased further (24) .

Since eIF2B\u03b1 is essential for P-eIF2's ability to inhibit eIF2B (39), P-eIF2 likely binds only the full eIF2B decamer, not its subcomplexes.

ISRIB provided significant beneficial effects in a mouse model of prion disease, and it also reversed neurological damage caused by traumatic brain injury (21) , all without exhibiting overt toxic side effects (27, 45) . By contrast, pharmacological inhibition of PERK caused pancreatic toxicity in mice, and knockdown of PKR had an aberrant effect on cytokinesis (15, 28) . Paradoxically, ISRIB did not display such adverse side effects in vivo (27) . Our observation that ISRIB is functional only within a narrow range of P-eIF2\u03b1 levels resolves this paradox. According to this notion, ISRIB does not negatively affect high(er) P-eIF2\u03b1 levels that may be relevant for certain stages during cell growth or proliferation. The fact that ISRIB has beneficial effects in vivo against several neurological disorders and other stress-induced pathologies suggests that P-eIF2\u03b1 levels would be relatively modest under these conditions. These considerations stress the importance to obtain quantitative data on how much eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation occurs in neurological disorders. More insight into levels of eIF2B, eIF2, and P-eIF2\u03b1 and the assembly state of these multiprotein complexes in different cell/tissue types exposed to different stress and disease conditions will be invaluable to predict and/ or evaluate effects of ISRIB treatment.",
