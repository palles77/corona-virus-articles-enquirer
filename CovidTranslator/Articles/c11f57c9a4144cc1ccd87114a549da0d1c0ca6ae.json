The magnitude of the enthalpy of association changes with temperature according to the change in heat capacity (\u0394C p ) on GP/Cr binding, being little affected for avian influenza virus (AIV) haemagglutinin (HA) binding to SA (\u0394C p = 0 kJ/mol/K) but greatly affected for HIV gp120 binding to CD4 receptor (\u0394C p = -5.0 kJ/mol/K). A thermodynamic model developed here predicts that values of \u0394C p from 0 to ~-2.0 kJ/mol/K have relatively little impact on the temperature sensitivity of the number of mosquito midgut cells with bound arbovirus, while intermediate values of \u0394C p of ~-3.0 kJ/mol/K give a peak binding at a temperature of ~20\u00b0C as observed experimentally for Western equine encephalitis virus. More negative values of \u0394C p greatly decrease arbovirus binding at temperatures below ~20\u00b0C. Thus to promote transmission at low temperatures, arboviruses may benefit from \u0394C p ~ 0 kJ/mol/K as for HA/SA and it is interesting that bluetongue virus binds to SA in midge midguts.",

Of greater importance, however, is the decrease in entropy of the whole virus (\u0394S a_immob ) on its immobilisation on the host cell surface. \u0394S a_immob presents a repulsive force which the enthalpy-driven GP/Cr interactions weakened at higher temperatures struggle to overcome. \u0394S a_immob is more negative (less favourable) for larger diameter viruses which therefore show diminished binding at higher temperatures than smaller viruses. It is proposed that small size phenotype through a less negative \u0394S a_immob is selected for viruses infecting warmer hosts thus explaining the observation that virion volume decreases with increasing host temperature from 0\u00baC to 40\u00b0C in the case of dsDNA viruses.",

It is proposed that prior non-specific binding of HIV through attachment 4 factors takes much of the entropy loss for \u0394S a_immob so enhancing subsequent specific gp120:CD4 binding at 37\u00baC. This is consistent with the observation that HIV attachment factors are not essential but augment infection. Antiviral therapies should focus on increasing virion size, for example through binding of zinc oxide nanoparticles to herpes simplex virus, hence making \u0394S a_immob more negative, and thus reducing binding affinity at 37\u00baC.",

            "text": "Some viruses infect hosts over a range of temperatures depending on the host species. Most notable are the arboviruses which may infect the arthropod vector over a range of ambient temperatures from ~15\u00baC to >30\u00baC (Mullens et al. 2004) , and then infect a vertebrate host at temperatures from 37\u00baC up to 44\u00baC in the case of West Nile virus (WNV) in infected American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) (Kinney et al. 2006 ). Birds generally have higher body temperatures than mammals (Brault 2009 ) and the avian influenza virus (AIV) when jumping from birds to humans has to adapt to a temperature drop of 8\u00baC since the temperature in the human upper respiratory tract is ~33\u00b0C compared to ~41\u00b0C in the avian intestinal tract which is the site of replication of avian viruses (De Graaf and Fouchier, 2014) . Bats have higher core body temperatures than primates (up to 42.1\u00b0C for Phyllostomus hastatus which is an omnivorous bat from South America) when flying (O'Shea et al. 2014) . The core body temperature during flight of the insectivorous free-tailed bat (Mops condylurus) which may have been the origin of the 2013/15 severe Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa (Saez et al. 2015) is 40.5\u00b0C \u00b11\u00b0C (O'Shea et al. 2014) . Thus EBOV which infects a range of vertebrate species from bats to primates and deer may have to infect mammalian hosts over a range of temperatures. Similarly Nipah virus on jumping from fruit bats to pigs and humans (Daszak et al. 2013) may experience a small fall in temperature. Furthermore, cross-species transmission of viruses to bats (and other mammals) from invertebrates may occur with more regularity than has been appreciated (Bennett et al. 2018; Leendertz 2016) , and Bennett et al. (2018) have suggested that arthropods may host many \"bat-associated\" viruses that have defied detection in bats themselves (e.g. EBOV). Depending on the ambient temperature, viruses in arthropods would experience a 9 \u00baC to 15\u00baC temperature increase on being ingested by a bat at 41\u00baC (Gale 2017 ) and this could affect the binding affinity of the virus to its host cell depending on the thermodynamics of virus binding as is discussed here. In contrast other viruses only infect related host species, and in effect are maintained at similar temperatures. For example, simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) infect 36 different nonhuman primate species in sub-Saharan Africa and SIVs from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) have crossed species barriers on multiple occasions generating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 (Sharp et al. 2005) . Thus the main source of temperature variation experienced by SIV and HIV would be the effect of the circadian rhythm and the slight rise in temperature due to infection of the host which gives a range of 36\u00baC to 38\u00baC in the case of Rhesus monkeys (Huitron-Resendiz, 2007) .",

The thermodynamics of virus binding in terms of the changes in enthalpy (\u0394H a_receptor_T ) and entropy (\u0394S a_receptor_T ) on the specific interaction of the GP with the Cr receptor at temperature T during binding of virus to the host cell surface has been set out previously (Gale 2018 (Gale , 2019 .

There may also be constraints on the activities of viral replication proteins such as the AIV polymerase which showed a significantly higher activity at 33\u00b0C than 37\u00b0C (Ngai et al. 2013) . Only virus binding is considered here. Thus according to the van't Hoff Isochore, the binding affinity for a virus to its host cell at temperature T as represented by the association constant K a_virus_T would be greatly diminished for enthalpy-driven GP/Cr interactions at 8 higher temperatures compared to lower temperatures depending on the magnitude of \u0394H a_receptor_T (Gale 2019) . Indeed, assuming \u0394H a_receptor_T is constant over the temperature range, the more negative \u0394H a_receptor_T is in magnitude, the weaker the binding at higher temperatures. This presents a paradox if the K a_virus_T falls to less than ~10 14 M -1 in that higher temperatures would greatly diminish infectivity (Gale 2019) .",

A recent analysis has shown that virion volume and genome length for dsDNA viruses decrease by about 55-fold as the temperature of occurrence (i.e. host) increases from 0\u00baC to 40\u00b0C (Nifong and Gillooly 2016) . The temperature of occurrence in these dsDNA viruses ranges from near zero for those inhabiting polar environments to over 40\u00baC for those inhabiting endothermic vertebrates. Nifong and Gillooly (2016) suggest that this could reflect smaller viruses being able to replicate more quickly (due to more compact genomes) perhaps together with energetic constraints imposed by their hosts. However from the thermodynamic perspective, the decrease in volume and hence mass and radius of the virus will make \u0394S a_immob less negative for a 9 smaller virus than for a larger virus. It is shown here how a less negative \u0394S a_immob increases binding of the virus at the relatively high mammalian body temperatures and it is proposed that thermodynamic binding constraints may give smaller viruses a selective advantage for infecting hosts at the higher body temperatures of mammals and birds. In this respect, the large size of the HIV virion may present a constraint to binding at human body temperatures compared to the much smaller arboviruses for example.",

            "text": "In the case of HIV, the GP component of the GP/Cr interaction is the envelope protein (Env) which is a trimer of gp120 monomers. Each HIV Env trimer interacts with one CD4 molecule (Chuang et al. 2017; Liu et al 2017a) . This is different from the AIV HA trimer in which each monomer in the trimer interacts with one glycan Cr (De Graaf and Fouchier, 2014; Fei et al. 2015) . Initial attachment of the HIV virion to the host CD4 + T cell surface is relatively nonspecific (Wilen et al. 2012) with HIV Env interacting with negatively charged host cell surface heparan sulphate proteoglycans, or with pattern recognition receptors. According to Wilen et al. (2012) , non-specific HIV attachment to the host cell via any of these factors likely brings HIV Env into close proximity with the viral receptor CD4 and the CRR5 coreceptor, so increasing the efficiency of infection, although the physiologic role of non-specific attachment in vivo remains unclear. Here it is suggested that non-specific binding helps to overcome the thermodynamic entropy constraint of immobilisation of a large virus on binding at human body temperature by taking some of the entropy loss in \u0394S a_immob prior to specific HIV Env:CD4 binding. This would be consistent with the fact that non-specific attachment factors differ from receptors in that they are not essential, although they augment infection in vitro (Wilen et al. 2012) .",

It is known that increasing host membrane fluidity at higher temperature allows effective recruitment of more Cr molecules to bind the HIV virion (Harada et al. 2004 ) such that the number, n, of GP/Cr contacts increases with temperature (Frey et al. 1995) , and that increasing n can overcome both the effect of temperature on decreasing the GP/Cr binding affinity and the effect of a large negative \u0394S a_immob (Gale 2019) . The thermodynamic HIV binding model here is therefore modified to accommodate increasing n with temperature and so attempt to reproduce the results of Frey et al., (1995) .

Values of K a_virus_T intercept at T = T 0 because the n.\u0394C p (T -T 0 + T.ln(T/T 0 )) term in Equation 11 equals zero. Therefore for the purpose of demonstrating the effect of \u0394C p on the temperature sensitivity of K a_virus_T , T 0 needs to be chosen to be well above or below the temperature range of interest. It should be noted that the choice of reference temperature is artificial and is only used here out of necessity to demonstrate the effect of different \u0394C p values while fixing the K a_virus_T intercept temperature. Indeed a given GP/Cr system has its own natural \u0394C p value which cannot be altered and is measured experimentally (Myszka et al. 2000; Fei et al. 2015) . The T 0 temperature of 37\u00baC is appropriate to study arthropod vector competence for arbovirus transmission over the 10 to 35\u00baC temperature range in Case studies 1 and 2 as used previously for the arthropod vector competence model (Gale 2019) . However, since 37\u00b0C is the human body temperature at which HIV binds to host cells, 37\u00b0C is not a good choice for T 0 in case study 3 for which T 0 is therefore set to 4\u00b0C. The reference temperature is 37\u00b0C in Case studies 4, 5 and 6 because the experimentally measured value of \u0394C p for HIV gp120:CD4 binding ( Figure 1 ) is used together with \u0394H a_receptor_T0 and \u0394S a_receptor_T0 values measured experimentally at a temperature T 0 of 37\u00b0C (Myszka et al. 2000) , i.e. real data are used.",

(2005) using defective HIV gp120 monomers concluded that a single Env trimer is sufficient to mediate the entry of one virion, but that all three gp120 monomers in that trimer must be active. Klasse (2012) has proposed that a realistic model allows both a minimum requirement of two gp120 monomers with an increment in function by the third. This is consistent with the cryoelectron microscopy (EM) structure of the Env glycoprotein trimer (Liu et al. 2017a) showing that in each trimer, one gp120 monomer makes a primary contact with the bound CD4 Cr molecule while a second makes a partial contact (called the quaternary contact reflecting protein structure nomenclature) and the third gp120 monomer makes no direct contact with the CD4 at all. For the purpose of the model here, n represents the number of Env trimers on each HIV virion that interact with a CD4 Cr during binding. Brandenberg et al. (2015) demonstrate that divergent HIV strains differ in their stoichiometry of entry and require between 1 to 7 Env trimers, with most strains depending on 2 to 3 Env trimers to complete infection. Here it is assumed that n = 3 Env:CD4 interactions for HIV binding although the results of Brandenberg et al. (2015) do not separate cell surface binding itself from the subsequent HIV/cell fusion in the entry process. If it is later found that cell surface binding only requires one Env:CD4 interaction for example, while more are required for the membrane fusion, then the model here for C.V T should be re-parameterised with n = 1 although the number of Env:CCR5 and non-specific Env interactions with attachment factors (see below) should also be built into the model. It should be noted that as for the arbovirus model, it is assumed that the n = 3 Env:CD4 interactions act independently and not co-operatively in binding. This is reflected in Equation 7 and Equation 8 where \u0394H a_receptor_T and \u0394S a_receptor_T act additively.",

(2000) in Table 4 . To the author's knowledge there are no data for \u0394H a_receptor_T and \u0394S a_receptor_T for Env trimer binding to CD4. Therefore the values for \u0394H a_receptor_T0 and \u0394S a_receptor_T0 for HIV gp120 monomer:CD4 binding at 37\u00b0C from Myszka et al. (2000) are used for Env trimer binding to a single CD4 in the HIV model in Figure 4a and b as set out in Table 4 . Dey et al. (2007) reported values at 37\u00baC of -287.9 kJ/mol and -786.9 J/mol/K for \u0394H a_receptor_T and \u0394S a_receptor_T respectively for the wildtype HIV-1 YU2 gp120 monomer binding to soluble CD4. The more negative \u0394S a_receptor_T value for gp120 monomer:CD4 binding from Dey et al. (2007) reduces the binding affinity for gp120:CD4 by nine-fold (K d_receptor_T = 4.2 x 10 -8 M) at 37\u00b0C compared to that of 4.75 x 10 -9 M from Myszka et al. (2000) (Table 4) . This difference may simply reflect the different strains of HIV-1 used, namely YU2 by Dey et al. (2007) and WD61 by Myszka et al. (2000) . The HIV gp120 monomer:CD4 binding data of Myszka et al. (2000) are chosen here over those of Dey et al. (2007) because Myszka et al. (2000) present the variation in \u0394H a_receptor_T with temperature as shown in Figure 1 together with information on \u0394C p which Dey et al. (2007) do not consider.

It is recognised that the HIV concentration at 10 5 HIV virions per mm 3 used in this model is 10-fold to 100-fold higher than that expected in a recipient person's blood present in the capillaries lining the skin at the wound site where semen or blood from an infected source were introduced since maximum human plasma and human semen HIV loadings are in the region of 13,000 copies per mm 3 and 1,800 copies per mm 3 respectively (Gupta et al. 1997 ). This is not important, however, because the purpose of the models here in Figure 4 , Figure 5 and Figure 6 is not to produce a realistic dose-response but to explore the effect of changing \u0394C p , \u0394S a_immob , n and temperature on the trend in the predicted number, C.V T , of host CD4 + T cells with bound virus.",

(2013) reported a K d_virus of 10 -15 M for AIV where K d_virus is the dissociation constant for virus from the host cell and is the inverse of K a_virus_T . According to Yang et al. (2005) HIV virions bearing influenza A virus HA required 8 or 9 HA trimers for virus entry. This is equivalent to n = 24 to 27 HA monomers each of K d_receptor = 10 -3 M (Xiong et al. 2013 ). It is not clear whether the 8 or 9 AIV HA trimers are required for cell binding or membrane fusion in Yang et al. (2005) . However, if n = 24 HA monomers are required for AIV binding to the host cell to give a K a_virus_T of 10 15 M -1 then \u0394S a_immob equals -1,091 J/mol/K from Equation 17 (derived in Gale 2019). This is in the same order of magnitude as the -750 J/mol/K estimated for \u0394S a_immob on the basis of virus molecular weight (Gale 2019) . It must be emphasized that the estimate of 8 or 9 HA trimers in Yang et al. (2005) is based on a number of assumptions that may not hold, for example whereas each infection of a cell is a quantal, all-ornothing event, the infectivity of a virion could span a wide spectrum of propensities and each mathematical model could have different virological interpretations (see Klasse 2012) . However, in the absence of any data for \u0394S a_immob the value of n from Yang et al. (2005) at least provides a theoretical approach to estimate it from Equation 17 for this \"proof of concept\" model.",

It should be noted that non-specific binding to HIV attachment factors would not increase \u0394S a_immob to zero because there are multiple ways a virus could bind non-specifically compared to the one way in which it binds to the CD4 receptors through a specific interaction between Env and CD4, that is the \u0394S a_specific term is always negative i.e. <0 J/mol/K and \u0394S a_non_specific is always less negative than \u0394S a_immob .",

This is remarkably similar to the K d_receptor_T for the interaction between CD4 and HIV Env of 4.75 x 10 -9 M at 37\u00b0C (Table 4 ) and the same values for \u0394H a_receptor_T0 and \u0394S a_receptor_T0 not only for the four HIV Env:CCR5 interactions but also for the two non-specific interactions are therefore used as for the three HIV Env:CD4 interactions in Table   4 with the reference temperature, T 0 at 37\u00b0C.",

However, this variation in K a_virus_T between 10 12 and 10 13 M -1 is optimal for affecting the number of midgut cells with bound virus (Figure 3b ). This is because K a_virus_T is high enough such that a significant proportion of midgut cells have bound virus over the 0\u00baC to 40\u00baC temperature range but not high enough to exceed the 10 14 M -1 above which all the midgut cells are saturated with virus. The variation in C.V T with temperature with \u0394C p = -3.0 kJ/mol/K shows some similarity to the percentage variation in the amount of WEEV bound to BBFs from susceptible Culex tarsalis mosquitoes as measured experimentally by Houk et al. (1990) as represented by the symbols in Figure 3b . According to Houk et al. (1990) the K a_virus_T at 20\u00b0C for WEEV binding to BBFs from susceptible Culex tarsalis mosquitoes is 2.2 x 10 11 M -1 . This is within two orders of magnitude of the value of 1.57 x 10 13 M -1 predicted by the model here with \u0394C p = -3.0 kJ/mol/K (Figure 3a) .",

This paper furthers that model by allowing the change in heat capacity, \u0394C p , on GP/Cr binding to be included. This is important because it defines the effect of temperature on \u0394H a_receptor_T (Equation 4) and \u0394S a_receptor_T (Equation 6) and hence K a_virus_T . Of potentially greater importance, however, is the parameter \u0394S a_immob first formally identified in the thermodynamic analysis of virus binding (Gale 2019) . Thus it is proposed here that the value of \u0394S a_immob is not only important in explaining the observation that dsDNA viruses infecting warmer hosts are generally smaller in volume than those infecting colder hosts (Nifong and Gillooly 2016) but also may contribute to explaining the need for attachment factors to allow binding of a large virus such as HIV at the relatively high human body temperature of 37\u00baC.",

It is possible that statistical thermodynamics approaches analogous to the Sackur-Tetrode equation for the entropy of a gas may be developed to estimate \u0394S a_immob theoretically. The large size of the HIV virion (134 nm mean diameter) compared to a typical arbovirus (50 to 70 nm diameter) is consistent with a more negative value of \u0394S a_immob providing justification for the more negative \u0394S a_immob values used here for the HIV models in Figure 4 to Figure 6 compared to that used for the arbovirus models in Figure 2 and Figure 3 . Figure 2 to Figure 5 show the variation of K a_virus_T and C.V T with temperature as predicted by models assuming C total = 10 3 host cells in a 10 -6 dm 3 volume (i.e. mosquito midgut or human blood sample) challenged with V total = 10 5 virions. Previously it was shown that if K a_virus_T > ~10 14 M -1 then nearly all the host cells have bound virus at such a high virus dose (Gale 2018; 2019) . Thus the K a_virus_T plots and corresponding C.V T plots are best interpreted in terms of the temperature ranges over which K a_virus_T < ~10 14 M -1 .",

Values of \u0394C p from 0 to ~-2.0 kJ/mol/K have relatively little impact on the temperature sensitivity of the number, C.V T , of mosquito midgut cells with bound virus (Figure 2b) , while intermediate values of \u0394C p of ~-3.0 kJ/mol/K give a peak binding at a temperature of ~20\u00b0C as observed experimentally for WEEV binding to BBFs from susceptible mosquito midguts in Figure 3b . More negative values of \u0394C p at -5.0 kJ/mol/K greatly diminish arbovirus binding affinity at temperatures below ~20\u00b0C (Figure 2b ) which in turn diminishes the transmission efficiency of the arbovirus at temperatures below 20\u00b0C compared to GP/Cr systems with \u0394C p in the range of -2.0 to 0 kJ/mol/K (Figure 2d ). In evolutionary terms, to optimise arbovirus infectivity with n = 4 GP/Cr interactions over a range of temperatures, GP/Cr interactions with small \u0394C p would be selected as for AIV HA/SA binding (Table 3) . It is proposed here that to maintain some transmission efficiency at lower temperatures, arboviruses may use SA binding interactions as shown for BTV coat protein VP2 (Zhang et al. 2010 ) for which \u0394C p may approximate 0 kJ/mol/K as in the case of AIV HA/SA (Table 3 ). This would facilitate arboviruses' expanding their range into temperate regions of the world with climate change.",

This is due to the reduced affinity of the enthalpy-driven GP/Cr interactions at higher temperatures. Making \u0394S a_immob more negative shifts the K a_virus_T curve to lower values (Figure 5a ) thus exacerbating the effect of higher temperature on reducing binding. As K a_virus_T falls below 10 14 M -1 at higher temperatures, so C.V T falls (Figure 5b ). The magnitude of \u0394S a_immob merely positions the C.V T curve relative to the temperature scale with less negative values of \u0394S a_immob shifting the curve to higher temperatures (Figure 5b) such that high C.V T values are maintained at progressively higher temperatures as \u0394S a_immob becomes less negative (Figure 5c ).",

Furthermore, a large negative \u0394S a_immob imposes additional constraints on virus binding at higher temperatures exacerbating the reduced strength of the enthalpy-driven GP/Cr interactions at higher temperatures. Therefore other mechanisms may be needed by the virus to achieve binding at 37\u00b0C. These could include more GP/Cr contacts at higher temperature (Frey et al. 1995; Harada et al 2004) . An alternative strategy evolved by viruses could be to make \u0394S a_immob itself less negative such that virus binding is maintained at the higher body temperatures of mammals and birds. Two possible evolutionary strategies are suggested here which could make \u0394S a_immob less negative. The first is decreasing the size of the virus and the second is the use of non-specific attachment factors to randomly trap the virus on the cell surface prior to specific GP/Cr binding.",

This could explain the decrease in volume of viruses with increasing host/environment temperature as reported by Nifong and Gillooly (2016) for dsDNA viruses.

Thus the shift in the K a_virus_T curve to higher values with a less negative \u0394S a_immob in Figure 5a is consistent with HIV attachment factors augmenting infection (Wilen et al. 2012) . Indeed with n = 3 Env:CD4 contacts, significant binding of HIV to host cells is only achieved at 37\u00b0C if \u0394S a_immob is increased to > -280 J/mol/K (Figure 5c ). \u0394S a_immob is estimated here to be -1,091 J/mol/K for HIV. Thus the prior non-specific binding of HIV would need to realise a \u0394S a_non_specific of -810 J/mol/K for subsequent effective Env:CD4 binding at human body temperature according to the model such that \u0394S a_non_specific in Equation 19 takes ~75% of the entropy loss in \u0394S a_immob . Wilen et al. (2012) also report that HIV attachment factors are not essential. Again this is consistent with the model here when it is noted that the C.V T value of <1 CD4 + T cell with bound virus in Figure 5b is not a threshold and merely represents 1 mm 3 of blood. Thus with \u0394S a_immob = -348 J/mol/K, C.V T = 1 x 10 -3 at 37\u00baC (Figure 5c ). This represents one CD4 + T cell with bound HIV in 1,000 x 1 mm 3 volumes of blood, i.e. in 1 cm 3 of blood. Decreasing \u0394S a_immob further to -405 J/mol/K gives C.V T = 1 x 10 -6 at 37\u00baC representing one CD4 + T cell with bound HIV in 1 litre of blood.",

Figure 9 of Antoine et al. (2012) shows a herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) bound to a tetrahedral nanoparticle of zinc oxide (ZnO) called a zinc oxide tetrapod (ZnOT). The mechanism behind the ability of ZnOTs to prevent, neutralize or reduce HSV-2 infection relies on their ability to bind the HSV-2 virions (Antoine et al. 2012 ). The ZnOT being some 40 \u00b5m in size is much larger than the attached virion which could still attach to a host cell surface in terms of spatial considerations. However, the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob for a HSV-2 virion bound to a ZnOT nanoparticle would be very large and negative, indeed much more negative than for \u0394S a_immob for a free HSV-2 virion. Thus according to Figure 5c , binding of HSV-2/ZnOT to host cells would be greatly diminished particularly at the human body temperature due to the very large negative \u0394S a_immob . It is proposed that antiviral research should take into account and even focus on making the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob more negative in addition to looking at conventional approaches to block the GP/Cr interaction. The advantage of focusing on \u0394S a_immob is that only one ZnOT nanoparticle has to bind to a virus to markedly affect \u0394S a_immob , while a large proportion of the GP molecules on the virus have to be bound with inhibitors, including neutralising antibodies, to block virus binding (Klasse 2012) and hence eliminate \u0394H a_receptor_T0 in Equation 11.",

Normal, acidic cervicovaginal mucus greatly hinders the movement of virions of HSV and HIV, whereas mucus that is neutralized by semen provides a much less effective barrier against the same virions (Erickson et al. 2015) . Thus binding of the HSV or HIV virion to a ZnOT particle may not only decrease its diffusion coefficient in mucus but also make the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob more negative hence reducing the binding affinity of those virions which do make it through the mucus to the epithelial cell surface at human body temperature.",

            "text": "However, according to Equation 6 the predicted \u0394S a_receptor_T term becomes more favourable (less negative) with decreasing temperature and it is therefore the entropy term that facilitates the tighter binding of gp120 to CD4 at lower temperatures. Unfortunately Myszka et al (2000) only give the full range of values for \u0394H a_receptor_T (Figure 1 ) with no data for \u0394S a_receptor_T over the range of temperature. However, Myszka et al (2000) do give some graphical data from which \u0394S a_receptor_T at 25\u00baC can be estimated and it is reassuring this \u0394S a_receptor_T is much less negative at -473 J/mol/K than that of -691 J/mol/K measured at 37\u00baC and furthermore is actually less negative than the value of -492.8 J/mol/K predicted for 25\u00baC by Equation 6 (Table 4) and used in the model in Figure 5 . This is strong experimental evidence that warming to 37\u00baC and above does indeed give a significant reduction in the binding affinity of Env to CD4 as borne out by the 52-fold increase in the K d_receptor_T value for gp120:CD4 on warming from 25\u00baC to 37\u00baC as calculated from the actual data of Myszka et al (2000) (Table 4 ). Furthermore it suggests that the actual increase in K a_virus_T on cooling from 37\u00baC down to 25\u00baC may be greater than that predicted by the model in Figure 5a . The decrease in binding affinity with increasing temperature for HIV Env:CD4 is also supported by experimental data of Moore and Klasse (1992) which showed that soluble CD4 dissociated from HIV virions at temperatures above 35\u00b0C. Similarly Doranz et al. (1999) demonstrated that gp120 bound to CD4 + T cells began to dissociate at temperatures above 45\u00b0C. The data of Frey et al. (1995) in Figure 6 offer further validation of the model in that the binding of HIV Env-expressing cells to cells expressing CD4 decreases substantially at 37\u00baC as predicted by the model. The Env trimer is stable up to at least 60\u00baC (Chuang et al. 2017) suggesting it is not denaturation of the Env trimer itself that is responsible for the decreased binding at higher temperatures. However, care has to be taken in using Equation 4 and Equation 6 to predict \u0394H a_receptor_T and \u0394S a_receptor_T respectively down to very low temperatures. Thus although the predicted value of K d_receptor_T for gp120:CD4 at 4\u00baC is 3,700-fold lower than that at 37\u00baC (Table 4) , Frey et al. (1995) cite some studies which suggested weaker binding of soluble CD4 to HIV virions at 4\u00baC compared to 37\u00baC. Without actual binding data for HIV over the full temperature range, it cannot ruled out that K a_virus_T does not exhibit a peak with temperature as for the WEEV binding in Figure 3b . Indeed, binding of 125 Ilabeled gp120 to T cells peaked at 16\u00baC with binding at 4\u00baC much lower than that at 37\u00baC (Frey et al. 1995) . The increase between 4\u00baC and 16\u00baC is unlikely to be due to increased fluidity of the membrane allowing recruitment of more CD4 molecules because unlike the virus, each gp120 only binds a single Cr molecule. Dimitrov et al. (1992) showed that the activation energy for binding of soluble CD4 to cells expressing HIV Env changed at 18\u00baC suggesting 18\u00baC is a transition temperature. This could explain the peak in binding of gp120 at 16\u00baC reported by Frey et al. (1995) .",

The infection process may represent a bottleneck such that only one or two viral variants in the exposure dose successfully establish infection (Bull et al. 2011) . Thus in the case of norovirus, only minor variants at frequencies as low as 0.01% were successfully transmitted to establish a new infection (Bull et al. 36 2012) . The work here suggests that the actual size of the virion itself may present an additional constraint particularly at mammalian body temperatures. Thus although the average diameter for HIV virions with a single core is 134 nm, individual virions display a broad range of diameters extending from 120 to 200 nm with a skewed distribution (Briggs et al. 2003) . Furthermore while the majority of HIV virions contained a single core, almost a third contained two or more cores. The mean diameter of the HIV virions containing a single core (134 \u00b1 11 nm, n = 89) was significantly smaller than the mean diameter of virions containing two cores (158 \u00b1 16 nm, n = 43) (Briggs et al. 2003) . Thus the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob may vary between individual HIV virions within the same exposure dose. The key conclusion from Figure 5c is that the number of CD4 + T cells with bound virus is highly sensitive to the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob with just a 4.5% increase in the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob from -290 to -277 J/mol/K for example increasing C.V T by five-fold from 1 to 5 CD4 + T cells per mm 3 of blood at 37\u00baC. Thus smaller diameter viruses in a challenge does may have an advantage in binding and hence initiating infection at mammalian body temperatures. This also raises the question of the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob for an aggregate containing several virions of the same virus and in the case of EBOV, for the long filaments linking multiple genome copies (Beniac et al. 2012 ). It has previously been proposed that fusing multiple genome copies into the same filament in the case of EBOV takes some of the entropy loss for \u0394S a_immob prior to binding to the cell surface (Gale 2017) such that aggregation can be viewed as a cooperative effect in the infection process. The effect of aggregation and virus size on the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob according to Equation 18 needs to be investigated and understood to further the work here.",

The relationship between binding affinity and temperature can be markedly affected by the change in heat capacity (\u0394C p ) on virus binding through its effect on the enthalpy and entropy of the GP/Cr interaction. Specifically large negative values of \u0394C p reduce binding at both low and high temperatures giving a peak binding at a medium temperature as has been observed experimentally in binding of WEEV to mosquito midguts. Very large negative values of \u0394C p for protein/protein GP/Cr interactions are predicted to diminish arbovirus transmission at low temperatures compared to the HA/SA glycan interaction for which \u0394C p is negligible. Thus selecting for SA glycan interactions as reported for BTV binding may be a mechanism to allow transmission at the lower temperatures experienced by arboviruses infecting arthropods in temperate regions of the world.",

The randomly attached virus \"rolls into place\" driven by n = 3 specific Env:CD4 interactions resulting in a further entropy loss (\u0394S a_specific ) as the virus particle takes up a specific orientation ready for viral entry.

The problem with Equation 18 is that proportionality constants in units of J/mol/K are needed probably based on R as in the Sackur-Tetrode equation and the natural logarithm terms should be dimensionless such that the units of radius cancel out. However for the purpose of representing the effect of increasing the radius of the virus on \u0394S a_immob Equation 18 is used with the virus radius in units of nm. Thus from Equation 18, the magnitude of \u0394S a_immob for a virus of diameter 134 nm is 18.6% more negative than that for a virus of diameter 66 nm.

Bacterial cells are larger than viruses and \u0394S a_immob would be expected to be more negative.
