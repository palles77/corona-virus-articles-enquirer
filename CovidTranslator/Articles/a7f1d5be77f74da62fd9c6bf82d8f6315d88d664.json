Methods: We evaluated survivors with confirmed SARS at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, at 3, 6, and 12 months after symptom onset. Our assessment included: lung volume (total lung capacity [TLC], vital capacity, residual volume, functional residual capacity), spirometry (FVC, FEV 1 ), diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), inspiratory and expiratory respiratory muscle strength, 6-min walk distance (6MWD), chest radiographs (CXRs), and HRQoL by Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey questionnaire. Results: Ninety-seven patients completed the serial assessments. There were 39 male and 58 female patients, and 63 patients (70%) were health-care workers (mean age, 36.9 years [SD, 9.5 years]; body mass index, 23.7 kg/m 2 [SD, 4.0 kg/m 2 ]). At 1 year, 27 patients (27.8%) had abnormal CXR findings. Four patients (4.1%), 5 patients (5.2%), and 23 patients (23.7%) had FVC, TLC, and DLCO values < 80% of predicted values, respectively. The 6MWD at 12 months was 511.0 m (SD, 89.8 m), which was higher than at 3 months (mean difference, 47.0 m; 95% confidence interval [CI], 31.8 to 62.1 m; p < 0.01) but not different from 6 months (mean difference, 9.7 m; 95% CI, \u060a 4.4 to 23.8 m; p \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.18). The 6MWD was lower than that for normal control subjects of the same age groups, and there was impairment of HRQoL at 12 months. Patients who required ICU admission (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 31) showed higher CXR scores (1.6 [SD, 3.1]; vs 0.4 [SD, 1.1]; p \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.04) and lower percentage of predicted FVC, TLC, and DLCO than those who did not, but there were no differences in 6MWD and health status. Conclusion: Significant impairment in DLCO was noted in 23.7% of survivors 1 year after illness onset. Exercise capacity and health status of SARS survivors were remarkably lower than those of a normal population.

In a study of 24 normal subjects (23 Chinese and 1 Indian; mean age, 29.2 years) in Singapore, the maximal static inspiratory effort from RV for the group was 83.5 cm H 2 O (SD, 35.5 cm H 2 O). 31 A Pimax of \u03ea 80 cm H 2 O and a Pemax of \u03e9 80 cm H 2 O generally exclude clinically significant weakness of the inspiratory and expiratory muscles, respectively. 32 Radiographic Assessment: Frontal CXRs were performed at 3, 6, and 12 months using standardized techniques with computed radiography equipment as we have reported during the major hospital outbreak. 7 The images were assessed using a picture archive communications system (MagicView VA22E; Siemens; Erlangen, Germany) and viewer (model 2K; Siemens).

The observers assessed the presence, appearances (airspace opacities or reticular opacities), distribution, and size of lung parenchymal abnormalities on each CXR of all patients. The size of the lesion was assessed by visually estimating the percentage of area occupied in each zone on each side. The overall percentage of involvement was obtained by averaging the percentage of involvement of the six lung zones. The frontal CXR closest to the date of the lung function test was assessed by two radiologists, both of whom were blinded to the clinical information. The findings were reached by consensus. The assessment method was described in our previous study. 33 ",

The serial results suggest an increase of the intra-alveolar diffusion pathway, which might be the result of diffuse alveolar damage and/or BOOP initially, 38 -41 followed by postinflammatory changes such as atelectasis, ongoing alveolitis, and parenchymal fibrosis later in the course of the disease. Our results are similar to a long-term follow-up study 44 in Beijing that reported that 27.3% of their SARS survivors (85 of 311 patients) had impaired Dlco, whereas 21.5% exhibited radiographic evidence of lung fibrotic changes at 1 year. Several studies 45-47 on ARDS survivors have shown that their pulmonary function generally returns to normal or near normal by 6 to 12 months, but Dlco may remain abnormal in up to 80% of patients at 1 year after recovery. 14 The decreasing trend for Va, discordant with TLC, observed in our study suggests there might be maldistribution of the inert gas during the single-breath Dlco maneuver, such as in the setting of occult small airway obstruction in some patients. Although expiratory HRCT was not performed in adult patients, 42,43 a pediatric study 48 of 47 asymptomatic children at 6 months from diagnosis of SARS showed that 16 patients (34%) had pulmonary abnormalities, whereas 8 patients (17%) had evidence of air trapping on expiratory HRCT.",

Previous studies 12, 49 have shown that 6MWD was substantially lower among ARDS survivors than control subjects 1 to 2 years after mechanical ventilation, whereas the absence of systemic steroid treatment, absence of illness acquired during ICU stay, and rapid resolution of lung injury were important factors associated with a longer 6MWD at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. 12 After controlling for the known effects of age and gender, our analysis has shown that percentage of predicted FVC was the positive independent factor associated with higher 6MWD at 6 months, whereas percentage of predicted FVC and percentage of predicted Dlco were the positive independent predictors at 12 months.",

            "text": "Given the relatively well-preserved lung function in the majority of our SARS survivors, the poor performance in the 6MWT in most age groups could be due to additional factors such as muscle wasting, myopathy, and possibly cardiac diastolic dysfunction. 50 Lau et al 51 noted that muscle strength and endurance were more impaired in proximal than in distal muscles among survivors in our SARS cohort at 3 months after illness onset. Eighteen of 44 SARS survivors in Singapore had reduced exercise capacity at 3 months after hospital discharge that could not be accounted for by impairment of pulmonary function. 52 These results suggest that the inability to exercise in recovered SARS patients is primarily due to extrapulmonary causes such as physical deconditioning and possibly steroid myopathy. 51, 52 In addition, 53% of SARS survivors complained of some 36) among SARS survivors at 3, 6, and 12 months after illness onset in comparison with HK normative data stratified into different age groups. 24 The vertical axis represents SF-36 domain score in mean (SD) from 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum), whereas the horizontal axis defines age groups in years. Based on the study by Lam et al, 24 there were 1,244 normal subjects and 695 normal subjects in the age groups of 18 to 40 years and 41 to 64 years, respectively. There were 19 SARS survivors and 12 SARS survivors who had required ICU support in the age groups of 18 to 40 years and 41 to 64 years, whereas there were 60 SARS survivors and 19 SARS survivors who did not require ICU support in the same age groups, respectively. *Significant at p \u03fd 0.01. **Significant at p \u03fd 0.03. #Significant at p \u03fd 0.05. mth \u03ed month. degree of large-joint pain, although only 12 patients (4.7%, including 7 patients in the current study) of 254 SARS survivors in our cluster of hospitals had evidence of osteonecrosis of the long bones on MRI conducted at a median of 6.7 months from hospital admission. 53 There are several possible causes for muscle weakness among SARS survivors. More than 60% of our patients complained of myalgia with elevation of creatinine kinase in 32.1% suggestive of viral-induced myositis at initial presentation. 7 Most of our patients required bed rest during hospitalization for an average of 3 weeks. The long period of bed rest could lead to muscle wasting and deconditioning, whereas the use of systemic corticosteroid therapy to suppress immune-mediated lung injury 4,7-9,19 could contribute to myopathy. Steroid myopathy has been reported in patients administered high-dose steroid for acute lung transplant rejection 54 and status asthmaticus. 55 Critical illness-associated polyneuropathy/ myopathy has also been observed in SARS survivors. 56 A small proportion of our SARS patients had evidence of respiratory muscle weakness. Inspiratory muscle weakness may cause atelectasis, whereas expiratory muscle (abdominal and intercostal muscles) weakness may lead to air trapping.",

There were significant and positive correlations between lung function parameters (VC, FVC, FEV 1 , and Dlco) and SF-36 domains such as PF, RP, GH, SF, and RE. There were also significant positive correlations between 6MWD and all SF-36 domains except for MH. The results are not surprising as, in addition to the physical impairment, the long period of isolation and extreme uncertainty during the SARS illness had created enormous psychological stress 57 and mood distur-bances. 58 In addition, steroid toxicity, personal vulnerability, and psychosocial stressors might have jointly contributed to the development of psychosis in some patients. 59 Other studies 11-14 on acute lung injury or ARDS survivors unrelated to SARS have reported impaired health status at 1 to 5 years after recovery, whereas pulmonary function abnormalities, especially Dlco, correlated with SF-36 domains. 13, 14 Twenty-seven patients (27.8%) in this study still had abnormal radiographic scores at 12 months, although their serial CXRs showed significant improvement. The positive correlation between the extent of residual radiographic abnormalities and the cumulative steroid dosage used for SARS was expected, as the former was an indication on the treatment protocol for more systemic steroid during the outbreak. 4, 7, 19 The negative correlation between residual radiographic abnormality and lung volume parameter (TLC) and parameter of surface area for gas exchange (Dlco) reflected the physiologic effects of parenchymal inflammation and fibrosis. Patients with more severe disease (as reflected by higher peak LDH level) 7, 19, 35 who had required ICU support during the acute illness had more residual opacities on CXRs at 12 months. In addition, they had more extensive pulmonary injury and fibrosis, as reflected by a significantly lower lung volume parameter (TLC) and Dlco at 12 months than those treated on the general wards. There were, however, no significant differences in 6MWD and HRQoL between the two groups at 12 months. In addition, there were no differences in any functional parameters between ICU patients receiving and not receiving mechanical ventilation. Herridge et al 12 reported that 20% of their ARDS survivors had minor abnormalities on CXRs at 1 year.",

CPET would also be too labor-intensive for a large cohort of SARS survivors. Nevertheless, reduced pulmonary gas exchange has been detected with CPET in some survivors of SARS at 3 months with normal Dlco. 52 Secondly, only 97 of 123 survivors (79%) in the cohort had completed the serial assessments over 12 months, and the results might not be representative of the entire cohort. Thirdly, we assessed respiratory muscle strength with mouth pressure, but low Pemax values do not always indicate expiratory muscle weakness and might result from technical difficulties such as mouth leakage. Lastly, we could not measure the effects of extrapulmonary factors (such as muscle deconditioning, steroid or viralinduced myopathy, cardiac diastolic dysfunction, critical illness polyneuropathy and/or myopathy) in the poor performance of the 6MWT. It is difficult to determine the contribution by psychological and motivational factors, as many patients are seeking compensation for occupation-related SARS. In summary, this study has shown significant impairment of Dlco in 23.7% of SARS survivors, whereas their exercise capacity and health status were remarkably lower than the general population at 12 months after illness onset. The functional disability appears to be out of proportion to the degree of lung function impairment and may be due to additional factors such as muscle deconditioning, steroid-related musculoskeletal complications, critical illness-related neuropathy/myopathy, and other psychological factors. Further follow-up is needed to assess if these deficits are persistent. ",
