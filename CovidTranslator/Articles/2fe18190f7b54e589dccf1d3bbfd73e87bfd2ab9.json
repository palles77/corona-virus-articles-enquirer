Still, there is growing 34 awareness that viruses as biological replicators are subjected to ecological sorting and so 35 require a viable propagation strategy. In the current analysis I depart from the precept that 36 virus fitness hinges on the virus transmission success. I examine the transmission ecologies 37 of the world main livestock viruses, 36 in total, a collection of pathogens well described in 38 terms of the organ system involvement, infection course, the extent of host damage, virus 39 shedding profile, and virus transmission modes. The viruses are on this basis ranked in an 40 outer-to inner-body fashion, virtually. As a next step, this ranking is disentangled with a 41 view to contrast two main host ecologies, poultry plus pig production and ruminant plus 42 equine husbandry, as well as to create a distinction among the RNA, DNA and retrovirus in 43 the study. The matches among these various virus traits serve to establish the outer-to 44 inner-body shifts in the interplay of host environment, virus-host interactions, and nature of Introduction 48 Increasingly, viruses are viewed in an ecological context, as living entities [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Viruses, 49 like all biological replicators, form a continuum along the selfishness-cooperativity axis, from 50 the completely selfish to fully cooperative forms [6] . In a deeper sense, the history of life is a 51 story of parasite-host coevolution that includes both the incessant arms race and various 52 forms of cooperation [7] . 53 Organ systems and virus transmission success 54 The current paper approaches the evolution of viral replication and propagation strategies [11] . 80 The study 81 The study explores the transmission ecology of the world main livestock viruses, 36 in total, 82 a collection of well described pathogens. Viruses are ranked in an outer-to inner-body 83 fashion, virtually, on the basis of the shifting organ system involvement, transmission 84 modes, and infection-shedding-transmission related variables. Next, this virus infiltration 85 ranking is disentangled to contrast the poultry plus pig to the ruminant plus equine viruses, 86 as well as to separately consider the RNA, DNA and retroviruses in the study, also ranked in 87 an outer-to inner-body fashion. 94 As a first step, the one-to-three scores allocated to the 36 livestock viruses for the four 95 ecological variables were matched on the basis of Spearman correlation, see also S2 Fig reflects, respectively, acute, acute and persistent, and persistent infections. Likewise, the 589 score for the infection severity level concerns a case fatality of less than one, one to ten, and 590 above ten percent. The score for the virus environmental survival rate refers to the number 591 of days that the virus remains infective outside the host body, ranging from up to three, 592 three to ten, to over ten days.

There are macroscopic dimensions to 57 virus transmission. For example, a virus may establish in the upper respiratory tract and 58 transmit by air via aerosols. An enteric virus features a fecal-oral cycle. A skin virus may 59 transmit on the basis of touch or abrasion. A virus colonizing the distal urogenital tract and 60 the external genitalia may transmit during sexual contact. Hence, the analysis of animal virus 61 transmission requires consideration of the overt clinical signs that associate with the 62 infection process, the gross pathology, and of how the infection translates in a virus specific 63 shedding profile. 64 Outer-versus inner-body and macroscopic versus molecular level 65 The virus organ system tropism may be assumed to evolve in harmony with the virus cell 66 tropism and so links the macroscopic to the molecular level virus-host interactions. This may 67 be further illustrated with the dichotomy in the release of viruses from epithelial cells. Apart 68 from direct cell-to-cell transmission [8], viruses may be released from the apical cell surface 69 and so end-up in the outer-body environment. To make it to the next host, these viruses 70 colonize the various mucosae or also the skin. Conversely, viruses released from the 71 basolateral cell surface infiltrate underlying tissues. These viruses may end-up in the lymph 72 drainage and from there enter the blood circulation and so infect any of the internal organs.",

In addition, the extent of virus infiltration and the virus 98 environmental survival rate were found correlated, negatively, with R = -0.44 and P < 0.01. 99 A virus family specific infiltration ranking 100 Next, the eleven virus families in the study were grouped and ranked A-D on the basis of the 101 infiltration scores allocated to the family viruses, see Fig 1. The transmission of the viruses 102 belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae and the Paramyxoviridae families was found to result 103 strictly from epithelial infections. Next, the transmission of the viruses belonging to the 104 Coronaviridae, the Picornaviridae and the Poxviridae was in part found modulated by 105 internal organ systems. Next, the transmission of the viruses belonging to the Arteriviridae, 106 the Flaviviridae, the Herpesviridae, plus also the single infectious bursal disease virus, was 107 found modulated by both epithelia and internal organ systems. Finally, the transmission of 108 the viruses belonging to the Retroviridae family plus the single bluetongue virus was found 109 modulated by epithelia and internal organ systems or by just internal organ systems. 110 Spearman correlation based on the new, family specific, one-to-four virus host-body 111 infiltration score and the length of the infection period score yielded an R = 0.86 and P = 0. 112 The new match with the virus environmental survival rate score yielded an R = -0.46 and P < 113 0.005. When virus environmental survival was considered just for the outer-body viruses, 114 virus infiltration and environmental survival were found positively correlated, with R = 0.53 115 and P < 0.05. For the inner-body viruses, infiltration and virus environmental survival were 116 negatively correlated, with R = -0.75 and P < 0.0005. In addition, virus infiltration and 117 infection severity were found correlated, negatively, with R = -0.38 and P < 0.05. 118 A virtual, outer-to inner-body line-up of organ systems 119 Next, the organ system tropisms of the viruses belonging to each family were collectively 120 fitted to and with the naked eye aligned with the Fig 1 family group line-up. As indicated in 121 Fig 2, the resulting, virtual outer-to inner-body line-up of organ systems runs from the for the infiltration ranking of the 36 viruses. Next, guided by the above 127 findings and by the literature data on the transmission ecology of each virus, see S1 Fig, the 128 36 viruses were ranked in an outer-to inner-body fashion, strictly on ecological grounds. As 129 shown in Fig 3, starting point in the infiltration ranking was the above established, virtual 130 line-up of organ systems. For each organ system or, as appropriate, combination of organ 131 systems, it was examined how the associated infection-shedding-transmission dynamics 132 matched. Considered were the length of the infection and shedding period, virus 133 transmission modes, virus environmental survival, and the infection severity level. The 134 ranking was accordingly refined. 135 The ranking of outer-body, epithelial viruses. In brief, from respiratory to alimentary 136 tract to skin, the length of the infection and shedding period and the virus environmental 137 survival rates were found to increase. The viruses colonizing both respiratory and alimentary 138 tract were found to present a distinct, intermediary category. The infection severity level of 139 the latter viruses was found to be relatively high. In general, epithelial viruses shedding over 140 extended periods of time, including after clinical recovery, were considered relatively deep-141 rooted. Some of the more persistent epithelial viruses featured also non-epithelial 142 transmission modes. Among the skin viruses in the study, the more infiltrative viruses 143 literally invaded all layers of the skin, causing slowly healing lesions. From outside-to-inside, 144 the transmission mode of the pox viruses changed, respectively, from being based on direct 145 plus indirect contact, to direct contact based, involving skin abrasion, or biting flies. With it, 146 the virus environmental robustness tended to decrease. 147 The ranking of inner-body viruses. Infiltration of the inner-body environment was 148 associated with a progressive increase in the share of persistent infections, a decrease in 149 virus environmental robustness, and, very gradually, a reduction in virus pathogenicity. Virus 150 infiltration of epithelia plus peripheral nerves and ganglia, seen for the herpesviruses, 151 typically translated in a persistent or recurrent epithelial infection, not unlike the effects semen, abortion during the various stages of pregnancy or, also, orderly virus 156 establishment, as evident from continuous seminal virus shedding, late term abortion, 157 congenital transmission, the combination of congenital and lactogenic transmission, or just 158 lactogenic virus transmission. Next, virus infiltration of the immune and circulatory systems 159 frequently associated with neoplastic disease. For example, infection by the jaagsiekte sheep 160 retrovirus (JSRV) was found to result, albeit in a minority of infections, in the pathognomonic 161 pulmonary adenocarcinoma, supporting virus transmission via virus release in respiratory 162 secretions. Other virus transmission modes comprise iatrogenic transmission and virus 163 transmission involving hematophagous arthropods. The trait profile of the arbovirus in the 164 study, the bluetongue virus (BTV) overlapped with that of the latter category.",

            "text": "The virus ranking by organ system. See bottom of the Results section.166    The interplay of host ecology, virus-host interactions, and virus genome167    Finally, as shown inFig 4,the ranking was disentangled to contrast poultry plus pig and 168 ruminant plus equine viruses, as well as to separately consider the RNA, DNA and 169 retroviruses in the study, ranked in an outer-to inner-body fashion, based on the virus 170 family group line-up shown in Fig 2. Not shown in Fig 2 is the foot and mouth disease virus, a 171 multiple host virus. Spearman correlation revealed the matches among the various virus 172 traits, as pertaining to the two virus host-ecologies, four infection-shedding-transmission 173 related variables, and the three virus genomes.174    The ruminant and equine viruses turned out to be environmentally less tolerant, with R = -175 0.52 and P < 0.005, and causing less severe infections, with R = -0.48 and P < 0.005. The 176 extent of virus host-body infiltration was found to increase from RNA to DNA to retrovirus,177    with R = 0.64 and P = 2E-05, for the match with the one-to-four virus infiltration score, and R 178 = 0.50 and P = > 0.005, for the match with the initial, one-to-three score. Also the length of 179 the infection period increased from RNA to DNA to retrovirus, with R = 0.66 and P = 1E-05,180    while the infection severity level decreased, with R = -0.39 and P < 0.05. Finally, also the viruses. The equine influenza virus (EIV) was ranked as least infiltrative. In185 horses, the virus causes a transient respiratory infection. The most important clinical sign is a 186 dry cough usually abating in a few days. Virus transmission is chiefly via aerosols. in pigs, the swine influenza virus (SIV) causes a respiratory infection involving mucus 189 production and resulting in coughing plus sneezing, aiding virus transmission also on the 190 basis of direct contact. The infection lasts about six days. Virus shedding may continue for up 191 to a month. The virus resists low temperatures; epizootics mainly occur during the winter. 192 Respiratory and alimentary tract viruses. Among the viruses infecting both the respiratory 193 and alimentary tract the rinderpest virus (RPV) was ranked first. Infection in cattle and 194 buffaloes translates in oculonasal discharge, excessive salivation and diarrhea. The virus is 195 typically transmitted during close, muzzle-to-muzzle contact. The virus is mainly excreted 196 during the first week. Fomites are not a viable means of transmission. There are no carriers. 197 Next, the infection caused by the closely related peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) in 198 sheep and goats associates with significant respiratory discharge and diarrhea. The infection 199 takes up to 14 days and there are no carriers. Virus transmission is on the basis of direct 200 contact or via aerosols. 201 Next, in poultry the avian influenza virus (AIV) causes respiratory and alimentary tract 202 infections, variable in severity. Highly pathogenic avian influenza in chicken usually translates 203 in per-acute death. Mild chicken viruses are also common. Virus transmission is on the basis 204 of aerosols, through direct contact or involving fomites, contaminated feed stuffs or water. 205 The virus is usually excreted for about a week. The virus may survive up to 32 days in , the avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) in poultry is responsible for, respectively, 208 respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous signs. In addition, clinically normal birds may carry tract viruses. Among the viruses colonizing the alimentary tract, the porcine 215 epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in pigs typically causes diarrhea. The infection lasts six to 35 216 days after the onset of clinical signs. Transmission is fecal-oral, involves fomites, feed, or 217 people. The virus survives for weeks outside the body. 218 Next, the porcine enterovirus encephalomyelitis virus (PEV1) in pigs is excreted in feces and 219 in oral secretions. Recovered animals may continue to shed virus for up to seven weeks. 220 Virus transmission is fecal-oral. The virus may survive in the environment for three months. 221 Next, the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in pigs causes vomiting and profuse 222 diarrhea, with a systemic component. Mortality is highest in young piglets not protected by 223 colostral antibodies. In adults, recovery takes five to ten days. Carrier sows may shed virus in 224 feces or milk. Transmission is via aerosols, through direct contact, fomites or vertically via 225 the milk. The virus resists low temperatures; epizootics occur mainly during the winter. 226 Mucosal and skin viruses. Among the viruses colonizing mucosae and skin the sheep and 227 goat pox virus (SGPV) in small ruminants was ranked first. The pox lesions take weeks to 228 heal. The clinical signs comprise oculonasal discharge. Virus transmission is direct or indirect. 229 The virus is extremely robust as it may remain infective in scabs for two months and for six 230 months in the environment. 231 Next, the contagious pustular dermatitis virus (CPDV) in small ruminants causes lesions on 232 mouth, muzzle, udder, and feet. Most infections heal in three to six weeks. Virus 233 transmission is mainly through direct contact. After recovery, virus on wool and hide remains 234 infective for up to one month. 235 Next, the fowlpox virus (FWPV) in chickens and turkeys causes dry skin lesions or diphteritic, 236 wet nodules in mouth and trachea, resulting in a protracted course of infection. The virus 237 slowly spreads in poultry flocks. The virus transmits during close contact or through skin the swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) in pigs causes vesicles on the feet, lower 241 limbs, and snout. Virus excretion from nose and mouth usually stops within two weeks. In 242 addition, there is evidence for a systemic infection. Virus shedding in feces may last up to 243 three months. The virus spreads mainly through direct contact. Also swill feeding may start 244 an outbreak. The virus is environmentally resistant. 245 Next, the foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) in cloven-hoofed animals may during 246 incubation be shed in milk and semen. Upon onset of clinical signs virus may be present in 247 breath, saliva, feces, and urine. Vesicles are found on the feet, buccal mucosa, and teats. The 248 carrier stage may last up to six months. Transmission is via aerosols, through direct contact, 249 fomites, or seminal. In pigs, swill feeding may play a role. The virus is was the lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) in cattle causes pox lesions on skin and 252 mucosae and is shed in milk and semen. Pregnant cows may abort. Virus shedding maybe 253 prolonged as acute infection translates in a carrier stage. Virus transmission is mainly by 254 biting flies, mechanically. 255 Epithelial viruses also latently present in nerves & ganglia and/or immune system. Among 256 the viruses colonizing the epithelia and infiltrating peripheral nerves plus ganglia and/or the 257 immune system, the equine herpesvirus-3 (EHV-3) was ranked first for causing non-invasive 258 lesions on the external genitalia which tend to heal in ten to fourteen days. Transmission is 259 on the basis of sexual or genitonasal contact. The virus is environmentally labile. 260 Next, the bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), infectious bovine rhinotracheitis or infectious 261 pustular vulvovaginitis/infectious pustular balanoposthitis virus in cattle and buffalo typically 262 infects the respiratory tract or the external genitalia. In the latter scenario, the virus may be 263 secreted from vagina or prepuce. Virus may also be present in semen. In addition, venereal 264 infection may trigger abortion or a fatal systemic infection in new-borne calves. The venereal 265 infection lasts five to ten days while virus shedding may continue two to sixteen days . Virus transmission is via aerosol, through direct contact and fomites. 271 The virus may persist for months in tracheal mucus or carcasses. 272 Next, the duck enteritis virus (DEV) in ducks, geese and swans is responsible for acute 273 diarrhea. Clinical signs comprise oculonasal discharge. Virus transmission is through direct 274 contact and fomites. Fecal contamination of eggshells may transmit the virus to hatching 275 chicks. Latently infected birds may continue to shed the virus in feces. 276 Next, the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is an immune-suppressive enteric birnavirus 277 of domestic fowl. The disease is most common in three to six weeks old birds. The virulence 278 level varies. The cloacal bursa is enlarged. The virus is shed in feces. Recovered birds may 279 carry the virus for long periods of time. The virus is environmentally resistant and readily 280 transmitted mechanically among farms by people, equipment and vehicles. 281 Next, the gallid herpesvirus-2 (GaHV-2) or Marek disease virus in poultry is responsible for 282 visceral lymphomas and neuropathological disorder. Proliferation of lymphoid cells is 283 typically followed by a latency phase, immunosuppression, and formation of neoplasms. 284 Virus is shed from feather follicles for life. Virus transmission results from inhalation of 285 infected dust. The virus remains infective for months to years. 286 Viruses of reproductive organs, also latent in nerves & ganglia and/or systemic. Among the 287 viruses infiltrating the reproductive organs system, peripheral nerves and ganglia, and/or 288 causing a systemic infection, the equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) or equine rhino-pneumonitis 289 virus causes respiratory, neurological and reproductive disorders. The respiratory infection is 290 usually mild and subsides within two weeks. Abortion tends to occur during the third 291 semester. Abortion storms may result from subsequent lateral, airborne virus transmission. 292 Infection around the time of parturation may translate in the birth of a weak, leukopenic foal 293 which dies after a few days. 294 Next, the swine herpesvirus-1 (SHV-1) or Aujeszky disease virus in pigs may also cause 295 neurological, reproductive, and respiratory disorders. Haphazard abortion, stillbirth and survives up to five weeks in pig meat. 300 Next, orderly virus establishment in the reproductive organs system as part of a systemic 301 infection is observed for the equine arteritis virus (EAV). The virus usually causes a mild 302 infection. Signs in horses may include nasal discharge, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, edema, 303 dyspnea, diarrhea, and abortion. Stallions tend to become long term carriers and continue to 304 shed virus in semen. Transmission is by aerosols, seminal and, incidentally, congenital. 305 Next, orderly congenital transmission is observed for the avian encephalitis virus (AEV) in 306 poultry. The virus is neurotropic, enterotropic, and establishes in the proximal genetic tract. 307 Congenitally infected chicks may shed virus in feces and so transmit virus to susceptible 308 chicks. Virus may be shed in feces for several weeks. In adults, carriers may result. 309 Next, the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) infection in carrier sows may typically result in the 310 birth to weak or also sub-clinically infected piglets. Clinical infections vary from severe per-311 acute to mild and chronic forms. Virus may be present in oculonasal discharge, blood, feces 312 and semen. Hence, transmission is fecal-oral, through direct contact, fomites, venereal or 313 congenital. Also swill feeding may trigger an outbreak; the virus is moderately fragile. 314 Next, the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes respiratory 315 disorders in young piglets and reproductive failure in sows. Virus transmission may be both 316 congenital and lactogenic. In addition, the virus may spread via the respiratory route, 317 through direct contact, swill feeding or venereally. Hence, virus may be present in saliva, 318 feces, urine, semen, and colostrum. Persistently infected sows may abort or, also, give birth 319 to weak or apparently healthy infected piglets. 320 Next, for the bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) congenital transmission plays a central role 321 in the virus transmission cycle. Virus may also be present in saliva, feces, blood, urine, 322 semen, colostrum, and aborted materials. The infections in cattle vary from subclinical to 323 severe to fatal. Signs may include ulceration of the alimentary mucosa, salivation, respiratory 324 signs, leucopenia, abortion, and congenital anomalies. Acutely infected cattle shed the virus lentiviruses of sheep and goats and rely on lactogenic virus transmission. 329 Most animal become infected early in life, from drinking infected colostrum or milk. Most 330 infections are subclinical and for life. In sheep, progressive dyspnea or neurological signs 331 may be observed. Encephalomyelitis and poly-arthritis tend to develop in goats. Once clinical 332 signs appear the disease is progressive and usually fatal. Virus may be present in respiratory 333 secretions, feces, semen, colostrum and milk. Virus transmission resulting from direct 334 contact is uncommon; the virus is labile. 335 Viruses of immune and circulatory systems. Among the viruses infiltrating the immune and 336 circulatory systems and epithelia, the avian leukosis virus (ALV) in domestic fowl causes 337 subclinical infection, leukaemia-like, proliferative disease of the hemopoietic system, clonal 338 malignancies of the bursal-dependent lymphoid system, or myeloid leukosis. Clinical signs 339 include weakness, diarrhea, dehydration and emaciation. Chicken with subclinical disease 340 usually shed virus into the albumen or yolk of eggs. Congenitally infected chicks remain 341 viremic for life. Virus may be present feces, saliva, and desquamated skin. Virus survival 342 outside the host body is restricted to a few hours. 343 Next, the jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) causes clinical signs only in the minority of sheep 344 that develop pulmonary adenomatosis. The virus is more readily detectable in peripheral 345 blood leucocytes and lymphoid organs than in the lungs. Incubation varies from six months 346 to three years. Once a lung tumor develops, the signs are progressive and comprise 347 emaciation, weight loss and respiratory compromise, ending in severe dyspnea and death. 348 Transmission is via milk and colostrum or by the respiratory route, probably via aerosols or 349 droplets. The virus is fragile. 350 Next, among the fully internalized viruses the bovine leukemia virus (BLV) causes lymphomas 351 in two to five percent of infected animals, predominantly adult cattle older than three to five 352 years. The main transmission is perinatal from cow to calf, via colostrum and milk. Also 353 important are trans-placental transmission, bloodsucking insects, iatrogenic and seminal 354 transmission. The virus is environmentally labile. colostrum or milk occur. The virus is environmentally labile. 359 Virus circulation in the bloodstream. Finally, partially overlapping with the above category 360 are the viruses circulating in the bloodstream and transmitting on the basis of the 361 involvement also of a biological arthropod vector. The bluetongue virus is an arbovirus of 362 sheep plus other domestic and wild ruminants. The virus completes an infection cycle in 363 midges of the genus Culicoides. The virus replicates for six to eight days in the salivary gland 364 after which the midges remain infective for life. In sheep most infections are transient and 365 in-apparent. Seminal and trans-placental transmission may also occur. The epithelial 366 infection does not contribute to the virus transmission success. The virus is the virus transmission modes and, with it, explains the organ system 372 involvement, in turn mirroring the host-cell infection cycle and, with it, the virus genome 373 type. For example, crowding conditions, frequently observed in poultry and pig production, 374 typically attract and select for horizontally transmitting, epithelial viruses. Respiratory and 375 enteric viruses flexibly adjust virulence levels to the dynamic host availability. At the 376 molecular level, these RNA viruses are released from the apical surface of epithelial cells, 377 directly into the outer-body environment. A diametrically opposite scenario is given by the 378 relatively stable host population ecologies observed in ruminant and equine husbandry, with 379 parent stock and their young grazing together in the open, not unlike the herbivores in 380 natural ecologies. The associated viruses count vertically transmitted viruses and also 381 arboviruses. The deep-rootedness of the infection in vital organs systems is at the molecular 382 level matched by virus replication also in non-epithelial cells. Virus latency and low viral 383 replication rates associate with minimal host damage. Retroviruses and other RNA viruses 384 dominate among these ingrained viruses. The DNA viruses in the study, and also the 385 remaining RNA viruses, appear less infiltrative and feature intermediary infection-shedding-386 transmission and host-cell infection dynamics. 387 Opportunistic viruses and outer-body habitats 388 Epithelial viruses typically respond to the variation in the environment external to the host-389 body. Epithelial viruses are highly evolvable [12]. For example, the influenza virus (EIV) in 390 horses generates a transient, dry cough supporting swift virus transmission via aerosols. In 391 pigs, the swine influenza virus (SIV) appears more infiltrative, causing both coughing and 392 sneezing. The latter requires significant mucus production. The infection may last for six days 393 and virus shedding may continue for up to a month. Virus transmission is through direct 394 contact, matching the social behavior of pigs. Likewise, rinderpest virus (RPV) transmits 395 among cattle and buffaloes mainly on the basis of close direct, muzzle-to-muzzle contact. 396 The virus is present in oculonasal discharges and saliva, in addition to being shed in feces. An 397 infection caused by the genetically closely related peste des petits ruminants virus in sheep 398 and goats results in significant respiratory discharge, supporting virus transmission on the . Brief summary of the virus transmission ecology of each of the 36 viruses. 578 References are made to the primary livestock host, the virus organ system tropism, the 579 length of the infection and shedding period, the infection severity level, the transmission 580 modes, and the virus environmental survival rate. Also indicated are references to the 581 literature sources detailed in S3 Fig. 582 S2 Figure. One-to-three scoring of four virus ecological variables. The four virus ecological 583 variables comprise, respectively, the extent of virus host-body infiltration, the length of the 584 infection period, the infection severity level, and the virus environmental survival rate. The 585 one-to-three score for the extent of virus host-body infiltration reflects, respectively, virus 586 transmission resulting from an infection of the epithelia, of epithelia and internal organ 587 systems, or of just internal organ systems.

Hence, for epithelial viruses specialization to 404 outer-body virus habitats is integral to virus fitness. 405 406 Projected on a long evolutionary timescale, the more infiltrative, inner-body viruses tend to 407 become locked in, a consequence of the substitution of the epithelial virus transmission 408 modes by internal organ systems based modes. Virus fatality of less than one, one to ten, and above ten percent. The score for the virus 470 environmental survival rate refers to the number of days that the virus remains infective 471 outside the host body, ranging from up to three, three to ten, to over ten days.
