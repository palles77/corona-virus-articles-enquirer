Trichomoniasis causes caseous masses that are easily removed without bleeding, whereas poxvirus typically creates more voluminous masses localized to the front of the mouth, and the mucosa bleeds when removed. Although trichomoniasis is primarily a disease of the upper alimentary tract, local lesions, including omphalitis, can occur, along with infection of the liver, lung, and other organs (Figs. 6 and 7) Erosion of the palatal flaps indicates previous or current infection. Tiny, pinpoint abscesses in the choanal region may be seen in chronic infections. Signs of infection depend on immunocompetency, previous exposure, and virulence of the infective strain.

Any debilitated, juvenile, or immunocompromised birds, especially squabs or circovirus-infected birds, are high-risk.

Clinical toxoplasmosis and sarcocystosis are rarely reported in pigeons; however, there have been several reports in the last few years. [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] Enclosure contamination with cat (toxoplasma) and opossum (sarcocystis) feces should be considered. Intestinal cryptosporidiosis was reported in pigeons in that had diarrhea and weight loss. 51 Feral pigeons have recently been found to shed microsporidia (Enterocytozoon and Encephalitozoon spp), which could spread to domestic birds that come into contact with them. 52, 53 There is little information on disease from microsporidia in pigeons at this time, however. pigeons but disease is possible and is a sign of an overcrowded pigeon aviary. Plasmodium spp are rarely reported in pigeons, but can cause disease in young or debilitated birds. Leukocytozoon spp have caused deaths in some Columbids.",

It spends most of its time feeding on birds' blood, causing anemia and transmission of Hemoproteus (and also possibly pox, PMV-1). Louse flies cause considerable discomfort to the bird and can be devastating to the general health of the flock. Louse flies have also been found to transport skin mites (Myialges sp) from one bird to another. 54 Columbicola columbae, the slender pigeon louse, is the most common mallophagian parasite. It does not take blood but feeds on feathers, causing tiny pinpoint holes. When lice are found by the clinician, other diseases should be considered. Heavy louse infestations usually indicate a debilitated bird that might not feel well enough to groom properly. Dermanyssus gallinae and Ornithonyssus sylviarum cause skin irritation and feed on blood. They are called red mites or roost mites and are found on the bird at night. Knemidokoptes mutans, the scaly leg mite, causes considerable skin damage. K laevis, the depluming mite, is rare.",

The author (L.W.) reports that fipronil (Frontline; Merial, Athens, Georgia) 0.29% spray has been used off-label successfully by wildlife rehabilitators on pigeons and raptor veterinarians to remove hippoboscids and also reduce black flies and mosquitoes. The suggested dose is two to three squirts under each wing and tail every 30 days. One of the metabolites of fipronil has higher toxicity to birds than the parent compound; use the product carefully because it shows variable toxicity in different avian families. 55 SUMMARY Treatment of infectious diseases in columbiform birds typically involves consideration for both individual birds and the flock. An awareness of the pathogens involved, including underlying viruses and bacterial sensitivity patterns, greatly improves the successful treatment of ill pigeons and doves. Considering organ systems involved and possible differential diagnoses is also useful (Boxes 1 and 2) .",
