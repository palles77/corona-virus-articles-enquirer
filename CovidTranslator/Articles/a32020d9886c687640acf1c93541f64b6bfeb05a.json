In the early 1990s, this viral disease was identified in Asia Shimizu et al., 1994) . In 1995, a PRRS outbreak was firstly recognized in Beijing of China. Since then, PRRS has been verified in many provinces in China, proving to be one of main swine diseases in China (Gao et al., 2004; Guo et al., 1996) . In China in 2006, an unparalleled large-scale, atypical PRRS outbreak caused by the highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) dealt a heavy blow to the swine industry (Zhou and Yang, 2010; Tian et al., 2007) .",

The virus has caused great economic loss to the Chinese swine production during the past years. Herein, we experimentally infected SPF pigs using two strains of PRRSV with different pathogenicity and observed the lung pathological changes looking for new sights on the possible pathogenesis associated with the virulence of HP-PRRSV. The results indicated that the HP-PRRSV-infected pigs died and exhibited severe pathological changes of lungs featuring increased neutrophils, mast cells and mononuclear macrophages, compared with the pigs inoculated with low pathogenic (LP-) PRRSV. Furthermore, the pigs infected with HP-PRRSV showed the higher levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-1b, interleukin (IL)-8 and histamine, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), platelet activation factor (PAF) in sera than those inoculated with LP-PRRSV. Additionally, the fibrosis of lung was observed in the HP-PRRSV-infected pigs. At present, our findings suggest that the aberrant immune responses triggered by HP-PRRSV infection are closely related to acute lung injury (ALI), and especially the pathological changes in lung vascular system are of particular significance. These associated pathological changes of lung are in part responsible for the additional morbidity and mortality observed in HP-PRRSV infection.",

A recent study found that HP-PRRSV could exhibit extensive tissue tropism for pigs (Li et al., 2012) . These observations of the pathological changes in tissues of HP-PRRSV-infected pigs suggested that HP-PRRSV infection induced severe pathological changes of lungs. Various kinds of pathogenic factors can cause acute lung injury (ALI), such as severe infection, shock, thoracic trauma, disseminated intravascular coagulation, gastric acid, smog, and toxic gas aspiration clinically characterized by rapidly progressive dyspnea and intractable hypoxemia (Gattinoni et al., 1998; Atabai and Matthay, 2002) . ALI may develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) characterized by damage to the alveolus-capillary interface, usually secondary to an intense inflammatory response of the host lung to infectious or noninfectious invasion (Levy et al., 2005; Bernard, 2005) . It has been shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and avian influenza A H5N1 virus infection could result in high mortality due to the complication of ARDS. Therefore, infectious pathogens, in which that the majority are viruses, have become one of the most important causes of ARDS (Headley et al., 1997; Chen et al., 2005; Subbarao et al., 1998) . Thus, it is intriguing to note that HP-PRRSV infection might be associated with ALI which may have the responsibility for the additional morbidity and mortality of the infected pigs.",

Meanwhile the rest 3 pigs in HB-1/3.9-infected group were euthanized accordingly. Two portions from each lobe of the left lung were collected immediately and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution. The whole left lung was weighed before and after desiccation at 80 8C drying to constant weight, and then the lung wet:dry weight ratio was determined which was taken as one indicator of lung edema (Lang et al., 2005) . Serum samples collected from the infected animals were detected for viral RNA using RT-PCR by amplifying a 312 bp ORF7 fragment of PRRSV. According to the method of Reed-Muench, virus titration in the lungs was determined with some modification. Briefly, three lobes of right lungs were sampled, frozen in liquid nitrogen and then ground into fine powder using a mortar and pestle, weighted for one milligram and homogenized in 1 ml cold phosphate-buffered saline. Clarified homogenates were titrated for viral infectivity in MARC-145 cells cultured in 96 well plates from initial dilutions of 1:10. Viral titers were expressed as mean TCID 50 per milliliter.

With regard to edema, the lung wet:dry weight ratio and the concentrations of histamine, PAF and LTB4 in serum were measured. As shown in Fig. 5A , the lung wet:dry weight ratio of JXwn06-infected pigs was higher than that of BH-1/3.9-infected pigs, with a significant difference on moribund (p < 0.01). The levels of histamine in JXwn06-infected pigs significantly increased from day 3 PI to moribund compared with those of HB-1/3.6-infected and control groups (p < 0.01), and on day 16 PI, the levels of histamine in the lungs of HB-1/3.9infected pigs had significant difference compared with those of control group (Fig. 5B , p < 0.05). PAF in JXwn06infected pigs also elevated significantly from day 5 PI to moribund compared to control group (p < 0.05), whereas no obvious changes of PAF were observed in HB-1/3.9infected pigs (Fig. 5C ). Dramatic increase of LTB4 in JXwn06-infected pigs was detected with highly significant difference compared to those of control group on day 5 PI to moribund (p < 0.01), and was significantly different from those of HB-1/3.9-infected group (p < 0.05).

To quantify the immune cell sub-populations responding to viral infection, we determined the cell numbers of specific inflammatory cell populations in the lungs of infected pigs using specific stainings. Mast cells, mononuclear-macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophils accounted for the highest percentage of the total leukocytes following infection (Fig. 6 ). On days 3 to 5 PI, mast cell numbers in the lungs of JXwn06-and HB-1/3.9-infected pigs were significantly higher than those of control group (p < 0.05), while on day 5 PI, more mast cells were in the lungs of JXwn06-infected pigs compared to those of HB-1/3.9-infected group. On days 9 and 16 PI (moribund), no difference in mast cells in mast cells was showed between JXwn06-infected and control groups, but mast cell numbers in the lungs of HB-1/3.9-infected pigs were dramatically higher than those of control group (Fig. 7A ).

The results of pathological changes showed that unlike HB-1/3.9infected group with mild lung pathological changes, more severe pathological lesions were observed in the lungs of JXwn06-infected pigs due to ALI. Firstly, almost the infected pigs exhibited clinical signs of respiratory disease, including visually prominent signs of respiratory distress in this study. Secondly, gross pathological changes and the dramatically increased lung wet: dry weight ratios showed that the infected pigs had highly edematous lungs. Thirdly, the infected pigs displayed a similar histopathologic pattern, including an initial peribronchiolar patchy pneumonia and interstitial pneumonia on day 3 PI and predominantly peribronchiolar lesions and light haemorrhage, and fully developed bronchiolitis, interstitial pneumonia and bronchopneumonia by day 5 PI. Pathological lesions in the lungs were characterized by inflammatory cellular infiltration, interstitial and alveolar edema, and hemorrhage. Lastly, on day 7 PI, the infected pigs suddenly presented prominent clinical signs of respiratory 7 . Numbers of mast cells, mononuclear-macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs of infected pigs.

Data were shown as means AE SD from 3 pigs each group. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 between control and virus infection groups. # p < 0.05 and ## p < 0.01 between HB-1/3.6-and JXwn06-infected groups. distress, especially on day 9 PI; the infected pigs showed severe dyspnea accompanying with tachycardia and cyanosis. These changes demonstrated that the infected pigs may develop progressive and severe hypoxemia in accordance with the time course of clinical signs and pulmonary lesions of ALI. Moreover, the ultramicroscopical changes of lungs suggested that after HB-1/3.9 infection, increased inflammatory cells in alveolar septa and a small number of death cells did not change the gas exchange function. On the contrary, blood cells deposition in vessel and alveolar space, severe alveolar epithelial cells death and serious pathological changes of vascular endothelial cells resulted in the ventilation and gas exchange dysfunction of lungs after JXwn06 infection. Furthermore, the death of type II alveolar epithelial cells serving as latent stem cells could not protect the normal lung structure through proliferation, leading to further damage of gas exchange function. The lung pathological changes observed in our report are consistent with those of previous studies (Guo et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012; Tian et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2009; Li et al., 2007) which strongly support our contention that HP-PRRSV contributes substantially to the ALI. Moreover, ALI induced by HP-PRRSV infection in this study showed similar clinical and histopathological changes to those induced by other pathogens, such as avian influenza virus and SARS virus (Gattinoni et al., 1998; Atabai and Matthay, 2002; Levy et al., 2005; Bernard, 2005; Headley et al., 1997) .",

Our previous study also found that HP-PRRSV displayed an expanded tissue tropism (Li et al., 2012) . After HB-1/3.9 infection, mild interstitial pneumonia and cytokines reaction were detected, but JXwn06 could induce more immune cells infiltration and higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines with regard to severe vascular injury, exudation and hemorrhage which flooded the alveolar space and increased the thickness of alveolarcapillary membranes and decreased the number of ventilated alveoli associated with hypoxia. These data suggest that extreme inflammatory injury rather than uncontrolled infection might be a determinant of the fatal outcome after HP-PRRSV infection.",

            "text": "As reported that an intense, neutrophil-predominant host inflammatory response could result in ALI. After stimulation by pro-inflammatory cytokines, the activated neutrophils could release free radicals, inflammatory cytokines and proteases which had contributions to lung lesions (Ware and Matthay, 2000; Avasarala et al., 2013) . In our study, we found that increased immune cells also included mononuclear phagocytes and mast cells besides neutrophils. On day 3 to 5 PI, the number of immune cells in the lungs of JXwn06-infected pigs increased by nearly 2-3 times compared with HB-1/3.9infected and control pigs, suggesting that mononuclear phagocytes and mast cells also play an important role in the process of ALI caused by HP-PRRSV infection. Previous studies indicated that the cytokines such as TNF-a were believed to be one of important factors involved in ALI (Ni et al., 2011; Grommes and Soehnlein, 2011; Goodman et al., 2003) . Xu and co-workers found that Chicken/HB/108 H5N1 infection could induce ALI and high levels of TNF-a in the lungs of mice, but TNF-a in serum showed significantly no change (Xu et al., 2006) . Several studies have indicated that PRRSV infection also could induce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Gomez-Laguna et al., 2010; Gimeno et al., 2011; Borghetti et al., 2011) . Our data demonstrated that there was no obvious difference of TNF-a level in serum between control and infection group, but TNF-a expression in the lungs significantly increased in JXwn06-infected pigs. Meanwhile, the levels of IL-1b which played an important role in inflammation only increased significantly in serum of JXwn06-infected pigs on day moribund. In addition, the levels of chemokine IL-8 in serum increased significantly in JXwn06-infected group from day 3 PI to moribund compared to HB-1/3.9infected and control groups. The results of cytokines changes in our study were consistent with those of Guo's experiment (Guo et al., 2013) , except TNF-alpha level was higher in the control group. These results indicated that IL-8, released into the blood in the early stage of PRRSV infection, gave a hand in immune cells infiltration into the sites of lung damage involving in inflammation. Then, TNF-a and IL-1b mainly produced by these activated inflammatory cells highly accumulated in the lung, and then aggravated the inflammation, inducing irreversible damage to the lung. Simultaneously, these results suggested the inflammatory cells such as mononuclear phagocytes were mostly recruited, sequestrated and activated in the lungs but not returned to circulation, which might be helpful for illustrating the phenomenon that no difference of TNF-a in serum existed between the groups. In addition, in JXwn06infected group, the levels of histamine, LTB4 and PAF significantly increased in serum primarily in response to increased permeability of the vessel and inflammatory cells accumulation. Owing to the fact that histamine and LTB4 are mainly produced by mast cells, and PAF is principally produced by neutrophils and endothelial cells, we propose that mast cell mostly located around blood vessels might be activated directly by PRRSV or the cytokines from activated macrophages, and then released inflammatory factors resulting in increased vessel permeability and inflammatory cells recruitment. Taken together, these results suggested that in the early stage of PRRSV infection, the immune cells in the lung were activated and then highly expressed proinflammatory cytokines causing a serious effect on the permeability of the vessels and recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lung leading to severe haemorrhage and exudation.",

Many studies found that fibrosis occurred in ARDS during convalescence leading to respiratory failure in a few years and an increased risk of death (Martin et al., 1995; Jeon et al., 2006) . Qiao and co-workers found that in mouse, ALI model following H5N1 virus infection, most mice developed fibrosis gradually at late stage; especially the survived mice underwent severe fibrosis on day 30 PI (Qiao et al., 2009) . In our study, on day 16 PI, severe lung fibrosis of one pig in JXwn06-infected group were observed, while no fibrosis or light fibrosis was observed in the lungs of other pigs as well as in those of HB-1/3.9infected and control groups. We first observed the fibrosis involved in lung injury occurred at the late stage of inflammation after JXwn06 infection, suggesting a close relation with fatal outcome of the infected pig. It is worthy to be noted that on moribund some pathological changes induced by secondary bacterial infection were also observed in JXwn06-infected pigs. Therefore, it is necessary for further investigating the role of bacterial co-infection in the pathogenesis of HP-PRRSV.",

Moreover, mast cell may play a major role in activating endothelial cells and increasing vascular permeability after HP-PRRSV infection. Our findings will be helpful for further investigation on the pathogenesis of ALI induced by HP-PRRSV and will provide valuable clues better clinical treatment for this disease.",
