            "text": "Seaweeds are potentially excellent sources of bioactive metabolites that could represent useful leads in the development of new functional ingredients in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. In the last decade, new marine bioprocess technologies have allowed the isolation of substances with biological properties. The brown alga Sargassum muticum (Yendo) Fensholt (Ochrophyta) was enzymatically hydrolyzed to prepare water-soluble extracts by using six different commercially available carbohydratedegrading enzymes and two proteases. Evaluation of 2,2diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) antioxidant, tyrosinase, elastase, and biofilm inhibition, antibacterial and antiviral activities as well as evaluation of cytotoxicity were realized for each extract. Total phenolic content was measured for extract characterization, and solid-phase extraction was useful to purify the enzymatic extract. Soluble total phenolic content of S. muticum Viscozyme extract was highest with 6.4% of dry weight. Enzymatic Celluclast and Viscozyme extracts had the lowest value of DPPH IC 50 indicating a strong antiradical activity, 0.6 mg mL \u22121 , in comparison with other enzymes. The ferric reducing antioxidant power ranged between 48.7 \u03bcM Fe 2+ Eq, digested with Viscozyme, and 60.8 \u03bcM Fe 2+ Eq, digested with Amyloglucosidase. Tyrosinase inhibition activity of S. muticum Neutrase extract was 41.3% higher compared to other enzymes. Elastase inhibition activity of S. muticum Shearzyme extract had highest activity (32.8%). All enzymatic extracts showed no cytotoxic effect towards the kidney Vero cells. Meanwhile, only S. muticum Neutrase and Alcalase extracts exhibited potential antiviral activity. In addition, S. muticum Viscozyme and Shearzyme extracts showed promising activity in suppressing the biofilm formation against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, respectively. Purification of S. muticum Viscozyme extracts by solid-phase extraction managed to concentrate the phenolic content and improve the bioactivity. These results indicate the promising potential of enzyme-assisted followed by solid-phase extraction in recovering phenolic content and in improving its bioactivity.",

Algae, rich in nutrition elements of interest, are traditionally consumed as food in East Asian countries, especially in Korea, Japan, China, and Indonesia.

Phlorotannins correspond to polymerization of phloroglucinol monomer units containing both phenyl and phenoxy units (Li et al. 2011) . Accumulation of these phloroglucinol-based phenolics contributes to the strong antioxidant activity against free radicalmediated oxidation damage (Kang et al. 2012a; Fujii et al. 2013) .

Even if phenolic compounds are sensitive to extraction techniques based on heat or solvent use (Kadam et al. 2013) , conventional solid-liquid extraction is frequently used to extract bioactive compounds from algae. There is no standardized protocol for the phenolic compound extraction, as each species produces different chemically structured phenolic compounds. Principal characteristic of solid-liquid extraction method is the utilization of organic toxic solvents and is often time-consuming. As stated by Ibanez et al. (2012) , a green chemistry technology concerns and searches for alternatives in order to reduce hazardous chemical exposure to humans and the environment, prevent the waste, and improve the extraction yield.

Enzymes used in this study were proven to be effective in increasing the yield of extraction in comparison with water extraction, except for Shearzyme. Furthermore, they have been mostly used in brown algae (Heo et al. 2003; Ahn et al. 2004a; Heo et al. 2005; Athukorala et al. 2006; Kim et al. 2006; Je et al. 2009; Sanchez-Camargo et al. 2015) . Highest yield was obtained from S. muticum digested with Neutrase, one of proteolytic enzymes, though the value was not significantly different from the other enzymes and water extraction. Enzymes from the protease group have been reported from several studies as an effective enzyme in enhancing the extraction yield in Ishige okamurae, Sargassum coreanum, Sargassum fulvellum, Sargassum thunbergii, and Scytosiphon lomentaria (Heo et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2010; Hardouin et al. 2014) . Nevertheless, the proteolytic enzymes yielding the highest as reported by previous studies were different from the present one; they were Flavourzyme and Alcalase (Heo et al. 2003) . Protamex yielded 19% of dry material for S. fulvellum, meanwhile for S. horneri, S. coreanum, and S. thunbergii extracted with Alcalase had 30-40% of extraction yield. In addition, S. coreanum extracted with Protamex contained 9.9 mg g \u22121 algal material of phenolic content, while Viscozyme extract had 11 mg g \u22121 of algal material. The highest phenolic content in S. horneri, S. fulvellum, and S. thunbergii came from the Alcalase extract with 5.3, 3.6, and 4.16 mg g \u22121 (Heo et al. 2003 ). In the present study, the highest phenolic content was also shown by Viscozyme extract of S. muticum with almost 6% of phenolic (6 mg g \u22121 ). Variety in phenolic content obtained from this study and previous one might be due to the different condition of extraction that was applied, i.e., temperature and concentration of enzyme, and also the type of species. It leads to an assumption that the structural heterogeneity and various amounts of algal polysaccharides-alginates, fucoidans, and laminarian in the case of brown algae (Rhein-Knudsen et al. 2015) , may influence the efficiency of enzymatic degradation. It is possible that the relative amount and sequence distribution of mannuronic (M) and guluronic (G) residues are two main factors affecting the extraction process since these are the main components in brown algal cell wall constituted as alginates. Mannuronic acids form \u03b2-1,4 linkages giving MM blocks a linear and flexible conformation. Meanwhile, guluronic acids generate \u03b1-1,4 linkages and introduce a steric hindrance around the carboxyl groups, thereby providing a folded and rigid structure, ensuring the stiffness in the polymer chain (Draget et al. 2005) . M/G ratio of Sargassum alginates varies from 0.8 to 1.5 (Andriamanantoanina and Rinaudo 2010) .",

This is due to phenolic compounds being easily degraded because of high temperature. Nevertheless, there are several studies that tested the extraction of phenolic compound using temperature above 60\u00b0C depending on the method and type of solvents that were applied for the extraction (Siriwardhana et al. 2008; Park et al. 2012; Shitanda et al. 2014) . For marine algae, their maceration into a high level of heat might accelerate the extraction process as the heating softens the tissues and facilitate the depolymerization of polysaccharides (Siriwardhana et al. 2008) , phenol-protein, and phenol-polysaccharide linkages (Tan et al. 2013) . As shown by Siriwardhana et al. (2008) , the brown alga Hizikia fusiformis extracted in water at 100\u00b0C for 60 min yielded 4.65 % phenolic content, while at 25, 50, and 75\u00b0C, it was only 1.40, 2.02, and 2.74 % of dry algal material, respectively. An elevated temperature may also help the solvents to reach the sample matrices as the viscosity and the surface tension of the solvents are decreased. In addition, it facilitates the solubility of analytes and promotes higher mass transfer rate (Dai and Mumper 2010) . Using high temperature will be mostly compatible with water as solvent, since water becomes a strong source of hydronium (H 3 O + ) and hydroxide (OH \u2212 ) ions, which can catalyze reactions, including hydrolysis of polysaccharides and proteins into smaller molecules. These molecules are more susceptible to react (Sereewatthanawut et al. 2008) . Organic solvents such as methanol, acetone, and many others tend to evaporate at high temperatures (approximately >50\u00b0C); thus, their efficiency decreases due to the shifting of solvent-to-water ratio leading to the change of sample-to-solvent ratio (Tan et al. 2013) . As reported by Dai and Mumper (2010) , besides temperature, the sample-tosolvent ratio is another one of the crucial factors that influence the yield of chemical extraction.",

The chemistry behind total phenolic assay like Folin-Ciocalteu assay relies on the transfer of electrons from phenolic compounds and other reducing species to molybdenum, forming blue complexes that can be detected spectrophotometrically. It is obvious that other reducing species besides phenolic compounds can also be involved in transferring the required electron (Plaza and Turner 2015) . Higher phenolic content from the enzymatic extracts of H. fusiformis result from the study by Siriwardhana et al. (2008) is likely due to the reaction of other molecules, such as polysaccharides and proteins. In addition, these molecules are suggested to contribute in the antioxidant activity of H. fusiformis. Hizikia fusiformis is regarded as a taxonomic synonym of S. fusiforme (Harvey) Hetchell (Stiger et al. 2003) . Therefore, it implies that the antioxidant activity in S. muticum enzymatic extract might also be due to the presence of polysaccharides and proteins.",

Soluble phlorotanninsphenolics of brown algae-are stored in cell organelles, called physodes observed in the cytoplasm of brown algae (Schoenwaelder 2002) . It is suggested that phlorotannins transformed into components of algal cell wall when physodes fuse with the cell membrane and the phlorotannins get secreted into the cell wall, complexing with alginic acid (Arnold and Targett 2003) . Phlorotannins are also known to form strong complexes with proteins (Stern et al. 1996) . As a consequence, enzyme facilitates the breaking of such complex linkages and this process results in liberating more phenolic compound to the solvents. However, it is important to note that high temperature had an adverse impact on the enzymes but the same case applies for the phenolic extraction . This is due to the instability of phenolic compounds as the elevated temperature stimulates a degradative reaction which is the oxidation of compound resulting in a decrease of phenolic yields (Dai and Mumper 2010) . In summary, the temperature of EAE applied in this study was more favorable and suitable for the extraction of phenolic compound. In addition, this method offers a softer condition compared to other methods that apply higher temperatures as previously described.",

It leads to an assumption that the carbohydrases disrupt the algal cell wall and release the metabolites linked to the polysaccharides, in this case the phenolic compounds. It is also possible that the phenolic compounds of brown algae are mostly attached to the alginates instead of proteins. As mentioned by previous studies, the phenolic compounds are not only covalently attached to the proteins but also to the alginates (Deniaud-Bouet et al. 2014 ). The enzymatic degradation of alginate fractions always releases a significant amount of phenolics since phenolic substances form high molecular weight complexes with alginates due to oxidation with haloperoxidases (Bitton et al. 2006 ). This type of linkage serves as structural component constituting the brown algal cell wall. Phenolic cross-linking of alginate may be an integral part of initial wall formation as shown in the Fucus zygote (Arnold and Targett 2003) .",

However, elevated concentrations of melanin in the skin can result in hyperpigmentation such as freckles and moles (Kang et al. 2012b ). While tyrosinase is responsible for skin pigmentation, elastase is a proteinase enzyme capable of degrading elastin. Elastin is an extracellular matrix protein providing elasticity to the connective tissues. It forms elastic fiber in skin dermis having an influence on skin elasticity Moon et al. 2010) . Therefore, inhibition of tyrosinase and elastase activities become a method to protect against skin aging Chang 2012) . There is interest in the potential of marine algal bioactive compounds in cosmeceutical industries related to their tyrosinase and elastase inhibition activities. In the case of phlorotannins, many studies have reported their potential in inhibiting the tyrosinase activity. Dieckol, isolated phlorotannins from the brown alga E. cava, has been examined for its inhibitory effects on mushroom tyrosinase. Dieckol was capable to inhibit the mushroom tyrosinase with IC 50 20 \u03bcM and it showed no cytotoxicity (Kang et al. 2012b) . 7-Phloroekol of E. cava has been observed to have an inhibitory effect on mushroom tyrosinase at 50 \u03bcg mL \u22121 . This compound was isolated from the ethanol extract of E. cava . These examples provide knowledge concerning the tyrosinase inhibition activity from marine brown algal phlorotannins. Some results presented in the present study are in accordance with previous studies as previously mentioned. Polyphenol extracts of S. muticum extracted in different commercial enzymes showed interesting results regarding the tyrosinase and elastase inhibition activities. Attention was given to the tyrosinase inhibition activity; S. muticum Neutrase extract demonstrated the highest activity at 41 % compared to other enzymes. Accordingly, this result indicates another promising potential of enzymatic extracts of S. muticum polyphenol in the point of view of cosmeceutical industry.",

            "text": "Enzymatic extracts of S. muticum polyphenol did not show expected result against bacteria, as they did not demonstrate any antibacterial activity. It is suspected that the presence of sugar could contribute to the growth of bacteria in the media. However, this assumption will need further verification by evaluating the purified enzymatic extract of Sargassum polyphenol. It has been demonstrated that purified phlorotannin showed potent inhibition of cell membrane integrity as well as cell metabolism against Trichophyton rubrum (Eom et al. 2012) . Phlorotannins from Ecklonia kurome were active against food-borne pathogen bacteria. Interaction between protein and brown algal phlorotannin has been considered to play important role in bactericidal action of purified phlorotannins (Ahn et al. 2004b) . Even though the enzymatic extract of Sargassum polyphenol did not show antibacterial activity, biofilm inhibition activity demonstrated the opposite result. It seems that polyphenol of Sargassum enzymatic extracts was more active against biofilm formation. This contradictive result is caused by different mechanism of inhibition. In antibacterial activity, the mechanisms of inhibition are most likely thought to rely on inhibition of extracellular microbial enzymes, deprivation of substrates required for microbial growth, or direct inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (Scalbert 1991). Regarding biofilm inhibition activity, two main mechanisms have been proposed, i.e., direct inhibition of bacterial settlement or survival of the macrofouler larvae and regulation of macrofouler growth, which in turn affects larval settlement of the macrofoulers (Avelin Mary et al. 1993 ). Some studies have reported the promising potential of brown algal polyphenol compound as antifouling agent. Water extract of S. vulgare polyphenol from its pneumatocysts presented 75 to 99 % inhibition of mussel Perna perna attachment. Polyphenol from leaflets of S. vulgare had 67 to 80 % inhibition of byssal adhesion (Plouguern\u00e9 et al. 2012) . Phlorotannin extract of S. tenerrimum had EC 50 of larval settlement inhibition of Hydroides elegans at 0.526 ppm. It indicated that this extract was effective in inhibiting the settlement of H. elegans larval attachment (Lau and Qian 1997) .",

However, for the past few years, several studies concerning the antiviral effects of brown algae phlorotannins have appeared. Ahn et al. (2004b) reported an inhibitory effect of 8,8\u2032-bieckol and 8-4\u2033-dieckol isolated from E. cava on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and protease in vitro. Phloroglucinol, eckol, 7-phloroeckol, phlorofucoroeckol, and dieckol isolated from E. cava were effective against porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus at concentration ranging from 10.8 to 14.6 \u03bcM (Wang et al. 2008) . Ethyl acetate fractions of phlorotannins from brown algae Eisenia bicyclis (Lessoniaceae) have been reported to show antiviral effects against genital human papilloma virus (HPV) at 50 \u03bcg mL \u22121 (Kim and Kwak 2015) . Dichloromethane/methanol extract of S. cymosum, S. polyceratium, S. vulgare, Padina gymnospora, Lobophora variegata, Dictyopteris delicatula, Sictyota menstrualis, and Stypodium zonale demonstrated herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) inhibition activity with percentage of inhibition ranging from 20 to 96 % at 400 \u03bcg mL \u22121 . Spectroscopic analysis of these crude extracts detected the presence of polyphenol compounds along with other active compounds like the halogenated sesquiterpenes obtusol, elatol, meroditerpenoid atomaric acid, triacylglycerols, and fatty acids (Soares et al. 2012 ). Out of eight, only two enzymatic extracts were found to be effective against the HSV-1; they were S. muticum digested with Neutrase and Alcalase. Result in this study regarding the antiviral effect of S. muticum enzymatic extract seems to be different from the previous studies. Out of eight, only two enzymatic extracts were found to be effective against the HSV-1; they were S. muticum digested with Neutrase and Alcalase. However, the antiviral effects of these two enzymatic extracts might not be provoked by the phlorotannins since the Viscozyme extract of S. muticum with high content of phenolic compound did not show any antiviral activity. It is possible that the presence of other compounds such as protein and polysaccharides that are in the enzymatic extracts is involved in disrupting the viral cells. As part of brown algal cell wall, phlorotannins are known to form a complex linkage with alginates and proteins. Early characterization by FT-IR has confirmed the presence of carbohydrates and proteins in S. muticum raw extracts. Zone 1800-600 cm \u22121 that was selected for PCA is the type that is usually used for polysaccharides and protein studies in algae (Rodrigues et al. 2015) .",

Based on the results presented in this study, different enzymes used give various results concerning the total phenolic content and their bioactivity. Among the eight enzymes, Viscozyme releases higher content of phenolic compounds and are correlated with strong antiradical activity. This might be supported by the optimum conditions provided, i.e., 50\u00b0C for 3 h, during the extraction process, which is favorable for the Viscozyme, extract activity. Since phenolic compounds are sensitive to heat and easily oxidized by the exposure of light, it is strongly recommended to apply a mild temperature between 40 to 60\u00b0C. Besides the extraction condition, in the case of phenolic compound, it is important to take the period of collection into further consideration. As commonly known, the production of phenolic compound is mostly stimulated by their environmental condition, such as the presence of grazer and direct exposition to sunlight. As a result, the content will vary according to the season.",

            "text": "Another important note to take is that by using enzymes, the active molecules released might not exclusively come from the phenolic groups. It is possible that it also extracts other molecules since the objective of this method is to degrade algae cell walls. Therefore, it will not be surprising that the fucoidan and protein might be responsible for the bioactivity of S. muticum. As a consequence, it will be interesting to further work on the purified samples pretreated by the enzyme-assisted extraction in the future. In addition, the characterization of S. muticum phenolic compound might help in understanding more about the mechanisms of their bioactivity.",
