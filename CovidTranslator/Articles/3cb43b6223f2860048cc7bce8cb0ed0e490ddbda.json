LEISHDNAVAX is a multi-antigen, T-cell epitope-enriched DNA vaccine candidate against human leishmaniasis. The vaccine candidate has been proven immunogenic and showed prophylactic efficacy in preclinical studies. Here, we describe the safety testing of LEISHDNAVAX in naive mice and rats, complemented by the demonstration of tolerability in Leishmania-infected mice. Biodistribution and persistence were examined following single and repeated intradermal (i.d.) administration to rats. DNA vectors were distributed systemically but did not accumulate upon repeated injections. Although vector DNA was cleared from most other tissues within 60 days after the last injection, it persisted in skin at the site of injection and in draining lymph nodes. Evaluation of single-dose and repeated-dose toxicity of the vaccine candidate after i.d. administration to naive, non-infected mice did not reveal any safety concerns. LEISHDNAVAX was also well tolerated in Leishmania-infected mice. Taken together, our results substantiate a favorable safety profile of LEISHDNAVAX in both naive and infected animals and thus, support the initiation of clinical trials for both preventive and therapeutic applications of the vaccine.",

            "text": "The leishmaniases are a complex of diseases caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania with up to 1.6 million cases reported worldwide annually 1 and~350 million people at risk to develop leishmaniasis. 2 It is estimated that the most severe form, visceral leishmaniasis (VL), causes up to 40 000 deaths per year. 1 Measures to control transmission of the parasite were of limited success to date. Despite advances in treatment of VL over the last decade, drug toxicity and heat stability, difficult routes of administration and variation in drug efficacy between endemic areas remain issues to be fully solved. A preventive and therapeutic leishmaniasis vaccine prospectively represents the most cost-effective and successful measure to control the leishmaniases worldwide. 3 Immunity to the intracellular parasite Leishmania is associated with T-cell-mediated immune responses. 4 DNA vaccines are particularly able to deliver antigens into the major histocompatibility complex class I processing pathway, thereby inducing CD8 cytotoxic T-cell immune responses, 5, 6 necessary for clearance of Leishmania. In addition, CD4 T cells and B cells are activated by DNA vaccines. Hence, this vaccination technology is a promising approach for developing a leishmaniasis vaccine. 7 An appropriate preclinical safety profile of a vaccine candidate has to be established prior to initiation of clinical phase 1 studies. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the World Health Organization recommend the evaluation of distribution and persistence of DNA vaccines as well as their local reactogenicity and systemic toxicity. 8, 9 Results of corresponding studies suggest that DNA vaccines are safe, 10, 11 which has been confirmed in several clinical trials. 12 However, immunogenicity of DNA vaccines was often modest in humans, necessitating better delivery methods and improved vaccine antigen expression. 12 In addition, safety concerns prompted avoidance of antibiotic resistance genes and other selection markers for plasmid propagation. 13 State-of-the-art plasmids are consequently more efficacious, safer and smaller than classical plasmids. 14 Minimalistic Immunogenically Defined Gene Expression (MIDGE) vectors represent one of the most rigorous concepts for improvement. 15 MIDGE vectors are small linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules, solely containing sequences required for their function in vivo and no bacterial plasmid backbone sequences as they have been shown to negatively impact transgene expression and immunogenicity. 16, 17 MIDGE-Th1 vectors are MIDGE vectors with a short peptide (PKKKRKVEDPYC) covalently attached, enhancing the immune responses to encoded antigens. 18, 19 Recently, preclinical data on biodistribution and toxicity of MIDGE and MIDGE-Th1 vectors have been published, 20, 21 indicating an excellent safety profile after a single administration.",

Comparing placebo-treated to LEISHDNAVAX-treated animals, no differences were observed in body weight, food and drinking water consumption, ophthalmological and auditory examinations, urinalysis, organ weights and the neurological screening. No local intolerance reactions were noted after single or repeated vaccine dosing. Minor deviations in single animals/groups for few blood parameters (large unstained cells, albumin/globulin ratio, \u03b1amylase) were classified as not vaccine-related. Macroscopic post mortem examination of organs revealed an enlarged spleen in a single male animal 1 day after single administration of 100 \u03bcg LEISHDNAVAX, which possibly indicated the activation of the lymphatic system. In all animals the histological findings were within the normal range of variation. No LEISHDNAVAX-related morphological lesions were found.

No local intolerance reactions related to the vaccine were observed. The results established in naive mice are corroborated by safety data obtained from the biodistribution study. Rats received 120 \u03bcg LEISHDNAVAX, corresponding to a human dose of~24 mg (based on mg kg \u2212 1 body weight). There were no vaccine-related toxic effects observed either. Our results further confirm the findings of other investigators reporting excellent preclinical safety profiles of DNA vectors. 10, 11, 20, 26, 27, 30 In Leishmania-infected and diseased individuals, tolerability of the vaccine may be different than in healthy, naive vaccinees. Moreover, owing to the ability of Leishmania amastigotes to exploit host IgG as virulence factor, 35 there is the theoretical risk of vaccine-related immune-enhancement of infection and pathogenesis as discussed for other infectious diseases. 36, 37 Hence demonstration of absence of disease exacerbation was included into the development program of LEISHDNAVAX. We evaluated the tolerability of LEISHDNAVAX in two different mouse strains, chosen for their inherent differences in cytokine responses to infection with L. donovani. 38 These experiments demonstrate that LEISHDNAVAX had no effect on the kinetics of the parasite burden with no vaccine-related enhancement of infection at any of the time points investigated. The kinetic of infection corresponded to the well-documented pattern in mice with a rapid increase in hepatic parasite burden, followed by a decline in parasite numbers and clearance and a slower increase in parasite numbers in the spleen with the establishment of chronic infections. 23 Results for all other standard parameters were similar for treated and nontreated mice, demonstrating a good tolerability of the vaccine candidate in infected animals.",

Animals injected with a single dose were killed 24 h after administration. Four-dose groups were either killed 24 h, 14 days or 60 days after the fourth injection. Clinical signs were recorded before, 30 min and 4 h after treatment, thereafter once daily. Twenty-four hours after injection, a modified Irwin test 39 was performed on the single-dose group and on a non-treated control group to assess acute neurological toxicity of the vaccine. Throughout the study, mortality was evaluated once daily and body weight once weekly. At killing, animals were anesthetized deeply by isoflurane inhalation and blood was collected from the plexus ophthalmicus. Gross pathology was performed and samples of the following tissues were taken: blood, thigh bone marrow, brain, heart, kidneys, liver (Lobus quadratus), lymph nodes (Lnn. axillares, inguinales, mesenteriales), lung, thigh muscle, ovaries, skin of injection site, spleen and testes. To avoid cross-contamination with vector DNA single-use scalpels were applied for each sample. All other equipment was thoroughly decontaminated after each dissection.

Female BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice (6-8 weeks of age at the start of experiments) were infected by injecting 2 \u00d7 10 7 freshly harvested L. donovani amastigotes intravenously into a tail vein as described. 42 Following infection, animals were sorted into groups of three to five mice per cage and two cages assigned to each treatment group. Groups of mice received either one, two or three injections of LEISHDNAVAX containing 20 \u03bcg DNA/antigen (corresponding to 100 \u03bcg total DNA) or PBS, administered in volumes of 25 \u03bcl i.d. at the base of the tail using 29G single-use needles (BD Microfine Plus Insulin Syringes). The first dose was administered 7 days after infection and repeat doses in 7-day intervals. Groups of mice were killed 7 days after having received the last dose of LEISHDNAVAX or PBS. In a further experiment in C57BL/6 mice additional groups were killed 29 days after the last of a total of three doses of LEISHDNAVAX or PBS.",
