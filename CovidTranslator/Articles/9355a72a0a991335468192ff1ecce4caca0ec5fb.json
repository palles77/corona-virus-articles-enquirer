In the present study, the molecular epidemiology, genetic diversity, and phylogenetic relationship of Korean PEDV field isolates to other reference strains were analyzed using the complete E gene. Genetic analysis showed that each PEDV group had several unique characteristics, which indicated that a specific group PEDVs may be differentiated from another group PEDVs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that recent prevalent Korean PEDV field isolates are closely related to the Chinese field strains and differ genetically from the European strains and the vaccine strains used in Korea, which raises questions of whether a new-type PEDV vaccine may be necessary for preventing PEDV infection more effectively in Korea. Notably, a large deletion identified only in the attenuated DR13 can be utilized as a genetic marker, and the methods developed in this study will help to rapidly detect and differentiate PEDVs.",

Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), caused by PEDV, is an acute, highly contagious, and devastating enteric disease that is characterized by severe diarrhea, dehydration and a high mortality rate in swine, resulting in severe economic losses in the European and Asian swine industry [23] .",

The amino acid sequence of the E protein is quite divergent among different CoVs notwithstanding that its predicted structure is highly conserved [31] . The CoV E protein has a pivotal role in the assembly of virions, where it may induce membrane curvature or aid in membrane scission [3, 10, 11, 25] . Beyond assembly, the E protein has functions during infection, including in virus egress and in the host stress response [2, 4, 8, 17, 18, 26, 34] . In addition, the E protein has ion channel activity and interacts with host proteins [1, 21, 24, 29, [31] [32] [33] . In the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, the deletion of the E protein modestly reduces its growth in vitro and in vivo [6, 7] , resulting in an attenuated virus. In other CoVs, deletion of the E protein results in either the complete absence of infectious virus or a severe reduction in virus titer [12, 16, 18] . However, unlike other CoVs, in the case of PEDV, little is known about the functions of the E protein.",

All Korean PEDV field isolates and PEDV vaccine strains (excluding the attenuated DR13 strain) have only point mutations in the E gene, and all PEDVs including the attenuated DR13 have CTAGAC 10 nucleotides upstream of the initiator ATG of the E gene, as previously recognized in Br1/87 [9] . These sequences are hexameric motifs common to CoVs and are similar to the hexameric motifs XUA(A/G)AC found adjacent to other PEDV ORFs. These hexameric motifs have been proposed to be the start sites for the transcription of subgenomic mRNAs [14] . The attenuated DR13 strain has a 21-nucleotide deletion at position 67-87 of its E gene, resulting in a deletion mutant of 69 amino acids.

These results are somewhat similar to those obtained in our previous study using the full-length M and ORF3 genes [20] . However, studies on the E gene of PEDV have almost never been reported although the E gene plays an important role in the biology of CoV, as described above, and to our knowledge, this is the first report of a molecular epidemiological characterization of PEDVs using the E gene. Moreover, this study shows that although the E gene is smaller than the other structural genes, it is sufficient to produce meaningful insights into the epidemiology of PEDV in Korea, and additional studies on the E gene should increase our understanding of the genetic relationships among PEDVs from a wider range of countries, their diversity, and the global epidemic situation of PEDV.",

As the damage caused by PED has showed steady increase, PEDV vaccines have been developed and are commonly used in Korea. However, in spite of the use of the vaccine, damage caused by PED outbreaks is continuous and serious in Korean pig farms. Recent prevalent Korean PEDV field isolates analyzed in this study differ from members of the group including the vaccine strains, and therefore, this result raises questions about whether a new-type PEDV vaccine may be necessary for more effective prevention of PEDV infection. The second strategy is to prevent the spread of PEDV more effectively by rapid detection of PEDV when PED occurs. The methods developed in this study can not only detect PEDV rapidly but also differentiate the live PEDV vaccine strains used in Korea, notably the attenuated DR13 strain of the most commonly used live oral PED vaccine in Korea, from all the other PEDVs. The present study allows a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology, genetic diversity, and phylogenetic relationships of Korean PEDV field isolates with the other PEDV reference strains. Moreover, the methods developed in this study can be utilized as a useful tool for the rapid detection and differentiation of PEDVs.",
