HIv/AIDS, influenza (including avian and swine influenzas) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SArS) have all spread rapidly across national borders. In addition, chronic illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer, some of which are caused by microorganisms 1 , have also become diseases of poverty and are on the rise in low-income populations in developing countries 2, 3 . We can no longer view the health problems of developing countries as fundamentally different from those found in high-income nations, and so addressing these problems requires a global approach.",

            "text": "To address shared health problems requires investment in research and innovation, as well as active contributions by all affected countries. Modern transportation and communications systems make it ever easier for researchers and entrepreneurs to collaborate wherever new opportunities arise. Specific expertise, exciting research material and prosperous markets energize individuals to cast their collaborative nets widely and to build North-South ties. We use the term 'North' to refer to countries that are classi fied as high-income economies by the World bank (sometimes called developed or industrialized nations), whereas 'South' is used to refer to countries that are classified as low-or middle-income economies by the World bank (also known as developing countries). In this Science and Society article, we discuss how developing countries can work with other countries to address their shared health problems as well as to promote scientific and economic development. We examine the factors that drive collaboration, identify the challenges that exist and discuss how the collaboration can have an impact in Southern countries. We also highlight how the global stage of health biotechnology innovation is changing and leading to a different landscape of collaborations. We draw on data from our own research programme on North-South health biotechnology collaborations involving Canada (a high-income country) and developing countries (low-and middle-income countries), as well as data that we have gathered with teams in brazil, China, egypt, India and Zambia on South-South collaboration between developing countries 4 (FIG. 1) . The research examines both research collaboration (mainly between researchers at universities and public research organizations) and entrepreneurial collaboration (mainly between private-sector firms). We relied on multiple sources of data collection, including analysis of the co-publications of researchers from different countries, a survey of health biotechnology firms in seven countries, and interviews with health biotechnology researchers, entrepreneurs and policy makers in 16 countries (mostly developing countries) in order to better understand the opportunities, challenges and impacts of the collaborations and to identify strategies to strengthen them. We interviewed 471 experts in total as a part of these studies (see Supplementary information S1 (box) for a detailed description of the study methodology).",

            "text": "drivers for north-South collaborations Capacity building. To extend the ability of developing countries to address their health problems, capacity-building efforts are required and can be a major driver for North-South collaborations in health biotechnology. Capacity building refers to human resource development and organizational development, as well as development of institutions and legal frameworks. In the past, capacity-building efforts in developing countries involved a linear donor-recipient framework that included mechanisms such as technical assistance and overseas training. There is currently an increased emphasis on using international partnerships between researchers in developing countries and high-income countries as a tool to promote science-intensive development [5] [6] [7] [8] . The main objective is to build capacity -scientific, technological, organizational and industrial -in developing countries so that they themselves can address their problems. Collaboration allows scientists in developing countries to become integrated into international scientific networks in addition to strengthening domestic capacity. It thereby creates access to expanded knowledge networks and has been shown to increase the research output of scientists in developing countries and their international visibility [9] [10] [11] . Economic development. The number of collaborations between firms in high-income countries and those in developing countries has increased in recent years 12 . These partnerships can either be informal in nature or involve formal alliances between firms. In the biotechnology sector, collaborations between firms are common and have become characteristic of the sector 13 . our survey of the entrepreneurial collaborations of Canadian health biotechnology firms shows that around one in four has collaborations with counterpart partners in developing countries 14 . These partners are mostly firms but also include universities, research institutions, hospitals and government agencies. These collaborations are more likely to be driven by economic than by altruistic goals; the large populations and large market potentials of many developing countries makes them attractive to Northern firms. Joint research and development was the second most common type of collaboration. Firms in Canada and developing countries are working together to strengthen their innovation potentials, to take advantage of each other's expertise and to lower the costs involved in the research, development and clinical testing of new health products. For example, Welichem biotech Inc. (vancouver, Canada), which is working to develop novel anti-inflammatory compounds from bacterial symbionts found in insects and nematodes in order to treat various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, partnered with Chinese collaborators to access cost-effective animal model testing conditions. In another case, Generex biotechnology Corporation (Toronto, Canada) entered into an alliance with local ecuadorian investigators at the Instituto de endocrinologia Metabolismo y reproducci\u00f3n (Quito, ecuador) to access their expertise in conducting clinical testing of its proprietary oral insulin spray product 13 . (See also another example in BOX 1.) Access to research material. Some developing countries possess traditional knowledge or biodiversity that offers promising health solutions 15 . Some have small and isolated populations that are valuable for research in genomics 16 . These resources are in high demand in industrially advanced countries and can encourage North-South collaboration in health biotechnology. Many low-and middle-income countries have large treatment-naive populations that can serve as unique models for studying specific pathogens. researchers from the North can thus benefit from collaborating with developing nations by increasing their own access to specific disease samples. In a largescale longitudinal cohort study, scientists from McGill university (Montreal, Canada) and the Ludwig Institute (S\u00e3o Paulo, brazil) examined the natural history of human papillomavirus (HPv) infection and cervical cancer in brazilian women from S\u00e3o Paulo; these scientists trained local laboratory and health care staff, established storage space for biological samples and set up equipment for molecular biology analyses. The infrastructure they established attracted the interest of pharmaceutical companies, leading Merck & Co., Inc. (New Jersey, uSA) to use it as a base for the clinical development of a prophylactic HPv vaccine 17 ",

However, there are concerns that a lack of regulatory oversight at these sites can make it difficult to collect high-quality data and can put patients at risk 18 . Local efforts and international partnerships to deal with these challenges have been on the rise. A mechanism for public registration of clinical trials has been established to improve the reporting of these trials and to enhance quality control and the safety of patients. India and China, for instance, are encouraging all clinical trials to be registered with government regulators (see Further information for web links) before participants are enrolled. Clinical trials in Latin American countries can now be registered with the Iberoamerican Cochrane Network 19 , and one of the goals of the International Clinical Trials registration Platform (ICTrP), which was launched by the WHo, is to harmonize and coordinate regional registries to promote the quality, transparency and ethical standards of global clinical trials.",

It is not just the expertise and technologies of developed nations that are in demand; with increasing participation by emerging economies, such as brazil, China and India 20-23 , North-South collaboration is increasingly motivated by a need to gain access to expertise and technologies in these countries. This provides more opportunities for high-income countries to work with these emerging economies to advance research. For instance, China's world ranking, in terms of the number of health biotechnology papers in international peerreviewed journals, went from eighth for the period 1998-2001 to second for the period 2006-2009, and brazil's standing went from twentieth to fourteenth in the same time span. Faced with increasing globalization, the Canadian scientists in our study believe that extending their partnerships with emerging economies will be important for sustaining their own competitiveness and may lead to research results that neither party would be able to achieve on their own. Scientists from emerging economies who were interviewed for this research also view these partnerships as critical for helping them to keep abreast of the latest technological developments in the field and for upgrading their local research bases.",

This fund is committed to stimulating collaboration between the two countries in S&T fields and places a special focus on biotechnologyrelated projects. Canada and brazil signed a framework for cooperation in S&T in 2008 (implemented by the ISTPCanada brazil program), which is expected to boost joint research in fields including biotechnology and pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceutical Gateway China-Finland/europe is a cooperative health technology cluster with an overall aim of increasing cooperation in the biomedical sciences between Finnish and Chinese universities and health technology companies. Many of the agreements include a strong focus on biotechnology collaboration and are expected to strengthen the innovation potentials of the participating countries and to contribute to economic growth. emerging economies and developing countries are also increasingly entering into formal S&T arrangements with each other, forming South-South collaborations. one example of such a collaboration is the Indiabrazil-South Africa (IbSA) agreement, which was formed in 2004. This trilateral agreement fosters stronger economic, trade and developmental ties among these emerging economies.

Thus, leveraging not only North-South but also South-South collaborations can be mutually beneficial for all participating parties; but a number of challenges remain.",

Promoting innovation involves an understanding of the institutional environment in which the partnerships are embedded; it entails the identification of bottlenecks and the re-calibration of the system to overcome them. To promote North-South and South-South collaboration, we thus propose that collaboration be viewed as a part of the interaction between two innovation systems.
