These programs were developed out of a need to counter the threat from our enemies and protect military forces and the homeland from biological attack. On the other hand, biosecurity is a more recent development, made up of policies and measures designed to protect the homeland, food supply, and agricultural resources from natural and accidental outbreaks and bioterrorism attacks. Many of the recent initiatives in biodefense and biosecurity came after the fall of the Soviet Union, as officials from NATO countries worried about the potential for Soviet biological weapons falling into the wrong hands. In the United States, the Clinton administration took a fairly proactive stance toward biological threat reduction. The events of September 11, 2001 , and the Amerithrax incident further solidified national resolve against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and acts of terrorism.",

You may recall from chapter Seeds of Destruction that the BWC is an international agreement, ratified by the US Senate in 1974, and signed by more than 100 other nations, including the Soviet Union. The Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989 was also detailed to protect the United States against the threat of biological terrorism. Nothing in the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989 was intended to restrain or restrict peaceful scientific research or development.

The act directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish and maintain a list of biological agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety (\"select agents\"). Furthermore, the act requires all facilities and individuals in possession of those same \"select agents\" to register with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The act created a like program at the US Department of Agriculture, which is being implemented through the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. (This portion of the chapter was excerpted largely from a statement made by The Honorable John H. Marburger, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, before the Committee on Science, U.S. House of Representatives, October 10, 2002.) HHS has maintained a list of \"select agents\" since April 1997. The rule has since been refined and amended with the publication date of March 18, 2005 (42 CFR Parts 72 and 73). The rule covers the transfer of select agents, including the registration of facilities engaging in transfers and exemptions from such registration. The intent of Public Law 107-188 was to ensure that the federal government would have visibility for all legitimate uses and inventory of biothreat organisms.",

In August 2002 the CDC published a Federal Register notice requiring all facilities in possession of select agents to notify it of their holdings. A form was sent to more than 200,000 institutions for this purpose, requesting a response, even if the facilities did not possess such agents.

The components of this comprehensive national biodefense program are threat awareness, prevention and protection, surveillance and detection, and response and recovery. National biodefense preparedness and response requires the involvement of a wide range of federal departments and agencies. Accordingly, the directive delineates responsibility and requires specific officials to optimize critical functions, such as information management and communications; research development and acquisition; creation and maintenance of needed biodefense infrastructure, including the human capital to support it; public preparedness; and strengthened bilateral, multilateral, and international cooperation. The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security was designated as the principal federal official for domestic incident management and was made responsible for coordinating domestic federal operations to prepare for, respond to, and recover from biological weapons attacks. This HSPD detailed the following: \u2022 A comprehensive framework for biodefense, \u2022 The creation of the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasure Center, and \u2022 Increased funding for \u2022 New vaccines (eg, Ebola virus), \u2022 Intelligence initiatives, \u2022 Biosurveillance, and \u2022 Mass casualty care, to include decontamination.",

Mitigating illness and preventing death are the principal goals of medical countermeasure efforts. Biological agents offer the greatest opportunity for medical mitigation, and this directive accordingly assigns priorities to countermeasure efforts. The directive recognizes that development and acquisition of effective medical countermeasures to mitigate illness, suffering, and death resulting from chemical, biological, radiological/nuclear, and explosive agents is central to consequence management efforts. Although it is not feasible to develop and stockpile medical countermeasures against every possible biological threat, the directive aimed at tackling some of the more important ones. The directive promotes the development of vaccines and drugs to prevent or mitigate adverse health effects caused by exposure to biological agents. This directive also provides for tailoring ongoing research and acquisition efforts to continue to yield new countermeasures against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agents and for incorporating such new discoveries into domestic and international response and recovery planning efforts.",
