They remain among the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Against a constant background of established infections, epidemics of new and old infectious diseases periodically emerge, greatly magnifying the global burden of infections. Studies of these emerging infections reveal the evolutionary properties of pathogenic microorganisms and the dynamic relationships between microorganisms, their hosts and the environment.",

EIs have shaped the course of human history and have caused incalculable misery and death. In 1981, a new disease -acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) -was first recognized. As a global killer, AIDS now threatens to surpass the Black Death of the fourteenth century and the 1918-1920 influenza pandemic, each of which killed at least 50 million people 2, 3 . Of the 'newly emerging' and 're-emerging/resurging' diseases that have followed the appearance of AIDS (Fig. 1) , some have been minor curiosities, such as the 2003 cases of monkeypox imported into the United States 4 , whereas others, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which emerged in the same year 5 , have had a worldwide impact. The 2001 anthrax bioterrorist attack in the United States 6 falls into a third category: 'deliberately emerging' diseases. EIs can be expected to remain a considerable challenge for the foreseeable future. Here we examine the nature and scope of emerging and reemerging microbial threats, and consider methods for their control. We emphasize that emergence results from dynamic interactions between rapidly evolving infectious agents and changes in the environment and in host behaviour that provide such agents with favourable new ecological niches.",

As Krause was completing his book The Restless Tide 24 , AIDS -one of history's most devastating pandemics -was already insidiously emerging. The emergence of AIDS led to renewed appreciation of the inevitability and consequences of the emergence of infectious diseases [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . In the past 25 years, some of the factors that resulted in AIDS have also led to re-emergences of historically important diseases such as cholera, diphtheria, trench fever and plague. Many re-emergences have been catalysed by wars, loss of social cohesion, and natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods, indicating the importance not only of microbial and viral factors, but also of social and environmental determinants [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] .",

Newly emerging infections are those that have not previously been recognized in man. Many diverse factors contribute to their emergences (see Box 1); these include microbial genetic mutation and viral genetic recombination or reassortment, changes in populations of reservoir hosts or intermediate insect vectors, microbial switching from animal to human hosts, human behavioural changes (notably human movement and urbanization), and environmental factors. These numerous microbial, host and environmental factors interact to create opportunities for infectious agents to evolve into new ecological niches, reach and adapt to new hosts, and spread more easily between them.",

Before jumping to humans an estimated 60-70 years ago 34 , perhaps as a consequence of the consumption of 'bush meat' from non-human primates, HIV-1 and HIV-2 had ample opportunity to evolve in hosts that were genetically similar to man (the chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, and the sooty mangabey, Cercocebus atys). But HIV/AIDS might never have emerged had it not been for disruptions in the economic and social infrastructure in post-colonial sub-Saharan Africa. Increased travel, the movement of rural populations to large cities, urban poverty and a weakening of family structure all promoted sexual practices, such as promiscuity and prostitution, that facilitate HIV transmission [34] [35] [36] [37] . Such complex interactions between infectious agents, hosts and the environment are not unique to the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS. The examples cited below further illustrate how changes in population density, human movements and the environment interact to create ecological niches that facilitate microbial or viral adaptation.",

Infections in animals that are transmitted to humans (zoonoses), and those transmitted from one vertebrate to another by an arthropod vector (vector-borne diseases), have repeatedly been identified as ranking among the most important EIs 25, 26 . Examples include the arenavirus haemorrhagic fevers (Argentine, Bolivian, Venezuelan and Lassa haemorrhagic fevers) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Viruses in these groups have co-evolved with specific rodent species whose contact with humans has increased as a result of modern environmental and human behavioural factors. Farming, keeping domestic pets, hunting and camping, deforestation and other types of habitat destruction all create new opportunities for such infectious agents to invade human hosts [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . The first epidemic of HPS, detected in the southwestern region of the United States in 1993 (ref. 38) , resulted from population booms of the deer mouse Peromyscus maniculatis, in turn caused by climate-related and recurrent proliferation of rodent food sources. Increased rodent populations and eventual shortages of food drove expanded deer mouse populations into homes, exposing people to virus-containing droppings. The 1998-1999 Malaysian Nipah virus epidemic 39 further illustrates the influence of human behaviours and environmental perturbations on newly emerging human infections. Pigs crammed together in pens located in or near orchards attracted fruit bats whose normal habitats had been destroyed by deforestation and whose droppings contained the then-unknown paramyxovirus. Virus aerosolization caused infection of pigs, with overcrowding leading to explosive transmission rates and ultimately to infections in pig handlers.",

BSE itself is suspected to have emerged because of even earlier use of cattle feed containing the agent of sheep scrapie, a prion disease recognized by farmers more than 250 years ago 41 . Alarmingly, the new BSE prion has become uncharacteristically promiscuous: unlike most known prions, it readily infects multiple species in addition to humans. This suggests the possibility of further emerging diseases associated with prions with currently unknown transmissibility to humans 40 .

Campylobacter jejuni and Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli O157:H7 and other agents of haemolytic-uraemic syndrome) infect agricultural animals, gaining access to humans through food, milk, water or direct animal contact. Other enteric pathogens, such as the vibrios causing classical cholera (re-emerging; see below) and serogroup O139 cholera, and the zoonotic protozoa Cryptosporidium parvum and Cyclospora cayetanensis 26 , seem to have come from environmental or animal organisms that have adapted to human-to-human 'faecal-oral' transmission through water.",

Streptococcus pyogenes caused a fatal pandemic of scarlet and puerperal fevers between 1830 and 1900 (ref. 44) . Scarlet fever, then the leading cause of death in children, is now rare, but has been largely supplemented by other streptococcal complications such as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis and re-emergent rheumatic fever 45 . When new microbes are discovered, their emergences as disease-causing pathogens may be delayed. For example, in 1883, Robert Koch was unable to show that the newly discovered Koch-Weeks bacillus caused serious disease. More than a century later, a fatal EI dubbed Brazilian purpuric fever was linked to virulent clonal variants of Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius (the Koch-Weeks bacillus) 46 . Although the bases of emergences of new and more severe diseases caused by S. pyogenes and H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius are not fully known, in both cases complex microbial genetic events are suspected. The distinctive clonal variants associated with severe H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius disease have been shown by PCR (polymerase chain reaction)-based subtractive genome hybridization to contain not only a unique plasmid, but also unique chromosomal regions, some of which are encoded by bacteriophages 47 . This research has narrowed the search for virulence determinants to unique proteins, some of which may have been acquired from other organisms by horizontal gene transfer. Streptococcus pyogenes has been studied more extensively, but the basis of severe disease emergence seems to be more complex than for H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius. Many factors associated with streptococcal virulence have been identified in strains bearing the M1 surface protein as well as in other M protein strains, among them bacteriophage-encoded superantigen toxins and a protein known as sic (streptococcal inhibitor of complement), which seems to be strongly selected by human host mucosal factors. Several lines of evidence suggest that changes in streptococcal virulence reflect genetic changes associated with phage integration, large-scale chromosomal rearrangements and possibly the shuffling of virulence cassettes (clusters of genes responsible for pathogenicity), followed by rapid human spread and immune selection 48, 49 .",

The discovery of isoniazid and other drugs initially led to effective tuberculosis cures, empty sanitoria and the dismantling of public health control systems in developed nations. Consequently, by the 1980s, when tuberculosis had re-emerged in the era of HIV/AIDS, local and state health departments in the United States lacked field, laboratory and clinical staff and so had to reinvent tuberculosiscontrol programmes 25 . The remarkable re-emergence of tuberculosis was fuelled by the immune deficiencies of people with AIDS, which greatly increases the risk of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections progressing to active disease, and being transmitted to others. Inadequate courses of anti-tuberculosis therapy compound the problem, leading to the emergence and spread of drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant strains 60 , and a need for more expensive treatment strategies such as directly observed therapy. It has been known for over a century that tuberculosis is a disease of poverty, associated with crowding and inadequate hygiene. The continuing expansion of global populations living in poverty makes tuberculosis more difficult to control. 63 .",

Both virulent and avirulent strains of these zoonotic bacteria are maintained in the environment and are rapidly evolving in association with phyto-and zooplankton, algae and crustaceans. Such environmental strains seem to act as reservoirs for human virulence genes (for example, genes for the phage-encoded cholera toxin and the toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP) factor associated with attachment), and to undergo gene transfer events that lead to new strains containing further virulence gene combinations. These result in periodic cholera emergences that cause epidemics and pandemics 73 . Thus, although the disease we know as cholera has appeared to be clinically and epidemiologically stable at least since the third pandemic (in the 1840s), modern evidence suggests that such apparent stability masks aggressive bacterial evolution in complex natural environments.",

            "text": "Influenza A viruses, which are endemic gastrointestinal viruses of wild waterfowl, have evolved elaborate mechanisms to jump species into domestic fowl, farm animals and humans. Periodic gene segment reassortments between human and animal viruses produce important antigenic changes, referred to as 'shifts' . These can lead to deadly pandemics, as occurred in 1888, 1918, 1957 and 1968 (refs 74, 75) . In intervening years, shifted viruses undergo continual but less dramatic antigenic changes called 'drifts' , which allow them partially to escape human immunity raised by previously circulating influenza viruses. Influenza drift is an evolutionary success story for the virus. Influenza A has a seemingly inexhaustible repertoire of mutational possibilities at several critical epitopes surrounding the viral haemagglutinin site that attaches to human cells. It remains something of a mystery how zoonotic influenza viruses mix with each other and with human strains to acquire the additional properties of human virulence and human-to-human transmissibility. Before 1997, mild cases of human disease associated with avian influenza viruses were occasionally reported 76 . These events have become more frequent, sometimes resulting in severe cases of disease and death. Avian influenza has recently made dead-end jumps to humans -for example, the 1997 Hong Kong outbreak of the newly emergent H5N1 influenza, the 2003 H7N7 epidemic in the Netherlands, the 2003-2004 H5N1 and H7N3 epizootics in Asia and elsewhere, and occasional cases of H9N2 disease (Fig. 4) . Meanwhile, back-switches of human H3N2 viruses have emerged in pigs, from which both doubly mixed (pig-human) and triply mixed (pig-human-avian) viruses 74, 75 have been isolated. Such enzootic/zoonotic mixing is suspected to have occurred in the influenza pandemic of 1918-1920, which was caused by an H1N1 virus with an avian-like receptor-binding site 77 . The predicted virulence genes of this virus are now being sought from 85-year-old pathology specimens and from frozen corpses 78 . The implications of interspecies genetic mixing for future influenza pandemics are troubling. Although much remains speculative about how influenza viruses emerge and spread, it seems clear that the process is driven by prolific and complex viral evolution (genetic reassortment and mutational 'drift'), interspecies mixing and adaptation, and ecological factors that bring humans into contact with animals and each other. By whatever means new influenza virus pandemic strains emerge, they eventually reach a critical threshold of human transmission beyond which epidemic and pandemic spread follows mathematically predictable patterns.",
