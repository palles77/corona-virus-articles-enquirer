It is, however, in the spirit of William Harvey. Harvey took employment in St Bartholomew's Hospital explicitly to serve the poor, as well as being physician to two kings. His greatest work on circulation underpins treatment of circulatory diseases in adults and children. It combined anatomy, physiology, mathematical modelling and enlightened speculation. 1 He was also a pioneer in embryology. Harvey instructed those giving the Oration to exhort the fellows and members of this College 'to search and study out the secret of nature by way of experiment' but also to recognise they are part of a wider medical community.",

A good example is the West African Ebola crisis 3 years ago. The initial risk of medical staff contracting Ebola was calculated at around 10% per person year, 79% of whom died. When we invited volunteers from the NHS to travel to Africa and tackle it we can be proud that there was a massive response from NHS staff, including many members and fellows of the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) going to support their Sierra Leonean colleagues. 2 Turning that epidemic around required medical and nursing staff, African and international, to combine absolute discipline, courage, basic clinical skills and innovation that would have been admired by any generation of physicians.",

            "text": "Viewed from the predictable future, the improvement in global child mortality and life expectancy in childhood over the past three decades will be seen as remarkable, and this change has considerable momentum to continue over the next two decades. Since 1990 the number of deaths in children under five worldwide has declined from around 12.7 million to around 6 million now and is still dropping rapidly (Fig 1 ) . Taking account of population growth, the global under-five mortality rate over that time has fallen by more than half from an estimated 91 to 43 deaths per thousand live births. 3 This rate of improvement has accelerated, and under-five child mortality fell from an estimated 72,000 to 48,000 just in the decadal period 2000-05 to 2010-15. The Economist recently described this, correctly, as the fastest reduction in child mortality ever seen anywhere. When it comes to specific diseases that have historically dominated child mortality, progress has often been even more encouraging. For example deaths from malaria, a disease which with many others I worked on, have according to the World Health Organization (WHO) reduced in children under five by 69% between 2000 and 2015, and by 35% just between 2010 and 2015. 4 These changes in child mortality are, barring some global catastrophe, largely irreversible. While child health has been the greatest global success in the past two decades, maternal mortality has dropped substantially since 2000 in many countries, 5 and several of the classical (neglected) tropical diseases which have infected humans through recorded history are in full retreat. 6 Many sciences converged to enable this remarkable improvement in global health. Several of these are not medical; agricultural science and engineering in particular contributed to economic development and the nutritional and sanitary improvements which are essential underpinning elements. Much of the improvement was however due to health science in the broadest sense, which included many of the biological sciences such as epidemiology and pharmacology but also the behavioural, economic and other social sciences. This required science from multiple disciplines, brought together in a coordinated way. To take the example of malaria, the prevention of infection relied on combining epidemiology, vector biology, chemistry and toxicology to develop insecticides, plastics engineering to incorporate them into bed nets, clinical trials, economics and anthropology to get them used. Treatment additionally required pharmacology, physiology, diagnostic science, among others. This scientific effort combining multiple methods was replicated across the many conditions and diseases leading to childhood mortality and morbidity. The attributable fraction for each scientific advance towards the overall reduction in child mortality is small, but the overall impact when all combined was very substantial. Two organisational principles were central to this rapid success. The first was clear goals: the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs, superseded by the Sustainable Development Goals), which started with the public health problem to be solved rather than where contemporary science was strongest, combined scientific skills with, critically, political support. 7 The MDGs challenged physicians involved in medical science to contribute to a reduction in child mortality of 75% everywhere by 2015. The research behind this was backed by resources from, among others, the UK government, the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation. Translating the science for improving health into action was then resourced largely by governments, with the UK government playing a leading role.",

There were, for example, excellent but far too few academic paediatricians to undertake the clinical research needed to tackle the major infections in children. There were not enough public health scientists to reduce the incidence of neglected tropical diseases. Much of the key clinical and public health research was therefore undertaken by adult physicians, many of whom were not originally trained in either infectious diseases or public health (and a high proportion of whom were from this College). This return to generalist physician-scientists, who would have been recognisable to Harvey, in the face of public health need may have lessons for the areas in which we are doing less well, a point I will return to.",

Many of the infectious diseases are down but by no means out; excitable talk of eradication is, for all but a handful, overblown. 8 Drug and insecticide resistance threatens some of the gains. 9 Above all, neonatal health is improving at a much slower rate than the rest of child health. Already in Asia the majority of children who die do so in their first 28 days and Africa is likely to be in the same position within a decade. 10 Improvements in neonatal health are also lagging behind the rest of child health in the UK and other industrialised countries. 11 The irreversible improvement in global child and maternal health can however, in my view, be regarded as a major triumph of medical science in our generation, although much of the science predates us.

Now that child mortality has dropped substantially virtually everywhere, it is possible to see which world view is correct. The answer is clear; in every country where child mortality has been relatively low for a sustained period, fertility dropped rapidly. The neo-Malthusian view of the world is still widespread, but is wrong on the data. Europe, North America and China are widely understood now to be below replacement levels of fertility. What much of the general public has not yet appreciated is that most of Latin America, Asia and North Africa are approaching or even at replacement levels of fertility of 2.1 live births per woman. 13 Only in Africa between the Limpopo and the Sahara, the area where child mortality has dropped most recently, are countries with high fertility still common, and a decline has already begun in most of these. The population of Africa will increase markedly over the next decades with important geopolitical implications (the population of Nigeria will, for example, probably become larger than that of the USA within our lifetimes), but the idea that Africa as it develops will run out of food or other basic resources before its population stabilises is not science-based. Africa is mainly relatively lightly populated, much larger than commonly imagined, with a substantial agricultural yield gap 14 and extensive natural resources.

The causes of this decline in stroke incidence are to a large extent similar to those of the decline in ischaemic heart disease, including reductions in smoking, hypertension and additionally anticoagulating people with atrial fibrillation (where there is still room for significant improvement). 21 The impact of medical science and practice on cardiovascular disease in this medical generation has therefore been substantial.

The prevention of cancer has also seen substantial advances in the last few decades. Scientific advances mean we know how theoretically we could prevent much cancer; the question is what the public will welcome, what it will tolerate and what it will reject. Government is generally on safe ground with public opinion when combating infections, or making the workplace safer, and more contentious ground when appearing to limit individual choices on health grounds. Some cancers are infectious in origin and both technically and politically largely preventable by government-driven interventions which have widespread public support. Probably the best example in the UK is cervical cancer. A screening programme through smear testing has reduced mortality by over 40% and in those who undertake regular screening by even more, but it does depend on uptake. 24 First-generation human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines will reduce incidence by around 50%. Next-generation vaccines will probably reduce incidence by around 90%. 25 With advances in current science, cervical cancer deaths should be exceptionally rare within three decades.",

The sheer scale of the threat this poses has meant the public have supported strong action in the face of sustained industry reaction. Rates of smoking have fallen a long way in the past three decades and are still falling, and the future effects on lung cancer and several other cancers will be substantial. When all the advances in prevention and treatment of cancer are combined, the effect on mortality and distribution of cancers will look very different for the indefinite future than it did when we all entered medical school. As with cardiovascular disease, there is much unfinished business, but any fair observer would say that the generational impact of science has been remarkable. Cardiovascular disease and cancer are not by any means the only areas where the health of those between young childhood and old age has been significantly improved by medical science in our generation, but even if we combine the effects of prevention and treatment of just these two disease groups, medical science in this generation has reshaped the demographic profile of mortality in the UK, from one where substantial numbers of deaths started in working age to one where mortality is heavily concentrated in those over 75.

The first is the rising tide of obesity, covered in the outstanding last Harveian Oration by Sir Stephen O'Rahilly. 27 The second is the spread of antibiotic resistance which the chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, has highlighted so effectively. 28 Common to both of these is that the underlying drivers, and the main solutions, are behavioural, including in the case of antibiotic resistance behaviours of our own profession. Physicians are generally far more systematic in the way they approach physiological or genetic problems than behavioural ones. There is a well-established science to behaviour change, studied in social science departments and deployed by marketing departments in the private sector. Until we embrace sciences like anthropology and the insights of marketing professionals we are unlikely to make much headway. Despite these less successful areas, about which we should be self-critical if we are to improve, history is likely to judge our generation of physicians very positively when it comes to reducing the incidence and impact of the major diseases of adults under the age of 75. The impact on cardiovascular disease and some cancers in particular can be considered objectively a triumph of medical science and organisation and will be carried through to the future.

Our structures, both scientific and clinical, are not optimised to address the challenges of older patients with multiple morbidities. It is widely recognised that the population of older people is increasing, in large part due to advances in medical interventions at a younger age. Office for National Statistics projections suggest that those in the population aged 85 or over will rise from around 1.7 million to around 3.7 million over the next 20 years. For those aged 75-84 the rise will be from 4.1 to 6.3 million. The effect of this increase in population of older people is made more stark because it is going to be highly concentrated geographically. Urban areas such as London or Manchester import youth (typically aged around 18 or 21) and then people tend to move out from the time they start a family onwards. 29 As a result, cities maintain their demographic structure which means that semirural and rural areas are ageing substantially faster than the average numbers would imply. This is going to provide a serious challenge to current delivery models of medical and social care. Whether it is door-to-needle time for stroke patients or finding carers for people with moderate dementia as the age support ratio changes, current structures are difficult to scale up to the degree needed outside urban areas and will need to be rethought. While the future geographical concentration of older people has probably been underappreciated, the financial impact of an ageing population on healthcare costs (as opposed to social care costs) is sometimes overstated. Healthcare costs are certainly rising, and the ageing of the population contributes to, but only explains a relatively small proportion of, that change.",

It is clearly not what is needed to meet this incoming tide. Scientific organisation tends to be single-disease focused; the much better recent vertical integration from bench to bedside around specific diseases often works against horizontal integration addressing the needs of those with several conditions. Research groups, promotion panels, grant-giving bodies, journal editors and specialist clinics all tend to handle multimorbidity and the science of multimorbidity badly.

We can also organise clinical services around common or particularly serious clusters rather than expecting individuals to go to multiple specialist clinics where at any moment only one of their many problems is being considered.

Many geriatricians find it extremely difficult to get time off for research even when they wish to because the service needs are so great, and, frankly, because research is not prioritised by elderly care services. This is a problem we as a profession need to sort out. It is very clear what the need is, that it is growing and that substantial scientific effort is going to be needed to address entirely predictable future problems. Broadly, there are two approaches and in my view both are needed. The first is to rethink elderly care medicine, making it more research friendly; for some scientific questions the particular skills of geriatricians will be essential and for most they will be very helpful. The second, and in my view even more important, solution is to ensure that physician scientists from all disciplines surge towards what is clearly the future need, that of older people, as they have for diseases of childhood in the developing world.",

A strong emphasis on mortality as the most important metric is an example. People vary in their personal preferences, but the experience of most clinicians who ask is that many, and probably most, older patients would often choose quality of life, dignity and independence over slightly extended quantity of life if a trade-off has to be made. It is harder to measure, but no less important.",

The new global and UK demographic structure, which as a profession we have done so much to create, means that from here on in a large part of the future of medicine is the health of older people with several clustered conditions. Science in this area is progressing, but at too slow a pace given the predictable rate of increase in need. Increasing specialisation, both clinically and scientifically, which has been so effective in younger groups works against our success in older people and a reverse back towards some form of generalist, or at least cluster-specialist, physicians may be needed. Future generations may be surprised at how slow, and even reluctant, we seem to have been to adapt to the new reality we as a profession have created.",
