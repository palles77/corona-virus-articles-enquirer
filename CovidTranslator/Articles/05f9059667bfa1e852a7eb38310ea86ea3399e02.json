To elucidate the role of Giardia duodenalis in calf scours, diagnostic samples from 189 scouring calves were tested by different assays during a 1-year-study period. Giardia antigens were detected in 22/189 scouring calves by a fecal-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and 10 of these were positive for assemblage E, G. duodenalis by polymerase chain reaction. Giardia trophozoites were demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in intestinal sections from five calves in which the parasites were spatially distributed in areas of microscopically detectable enteritis. Our data suggest that under certain circumstances, Giardia may cause intestinal lesions leading to calf scours. Gnotobiotic calf-based infectivity studies are needed if the pathogenicity of Giardia in calves is to be definitively determined. #",

This is frequently accompanied by scouring (Xiao et al., 1993; O'Handley et al., 2000; Wade et al., 2000a,b; Appelbee et al., 2003; Trout et al., 2004; McAllister et al., 2005) thus underscoring the potential pathogenic nature of this parasite in calves. Research conducted in Ohio, Tennessee, New York, and Minnesota suggests that Giardia spp. may be an important pathogen in calves (Xiao et al., 1993; Wade et al., 2000a,b; Nydam et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2004) . However, no attempts were made to demonstrate www.elsevier.com/locate/vetpar Available online at www.sciencedirect.com Veterinary Parasitology 157 (2008) 196-202 morphological changes in the small intestine of the calves studied. Interestingly, the Ohio study further reported that treatment of Giardia-infected scouring calves with metronidazole was associated with rapid cessation of the scours (Appelbee et al., 2003) , which provides indirect evidence that Giardia spp. was the cause of the diarrhea in these animals. With the lack of empirical morphologic evidence however, the importance of this protozoal agent as an enteric pathogen in calves has remained speculative. Conversely, the role of this parasite in young scouring non-bovine domestic ruminants has been clarified. Data from experimentally infected lambs and goat kids clearly demonstrates that feed efficiency and weight gain are negatively impacted by Giardia infections (Olson et al., 1995) .",

Decreases in the activity of certain intestinal brush border enzymes including alkaline phosphatase, lactase, maltase and sucrase, have also been reported (Smith et al., 2004; Buret, 2007) . These findings suggest that intestinal malabsorption is a significant consequence of Giardia spp. infection. In fact, this protozoan may cause severe enteric disease without penetrating the intestinal epithelium (Buret, 2007) . Recently it was demonstrated that Giardia-induced intestinal dysfunction involves apoptosis of enterocytes and downregulation of the tight junction protein claudin-1 (Troeger et al., 2007) . Although these mechanisms have not yet been described in calves, it is likely that similar to what happens in other young domestic ruminants, Giardia spp. has the potential to cause significant intestinal damage that can lead to clinically important calf scours. The objective of this study was to elucidate the role of Giardia spp. as a cause of intestinal damage in scouring calves.",

Results from these analyses and the parasite scores were recorded on a data sheet previously designed for this purpose. The scoring of the Giardia parasites was based on a scale ranging from 0 to 3 where: 0 = no parasites present, 1 = few parasites present, 2 = moderate numbers of parasites present and 3 = many parasites present.",

Following another wash step in TBS, the sections were incubated with a biotinylated anti-goat IgG (DAKO LSAB+ system) for 15 min, washed with TBS and the slides incubated for 15 min with streptavidin-labeled horseradish peroxidase. After another TBS wash, the sections were treated with two 5 min changes of Romulin red AEC chromogen, washed with deionized water, then with TBS after which they were counterstained with DAKO automation hematoxylin. The slides were further washed with deionized water, air dried and dehydrated in 10 dips of 95% ethanol, 10 dips in absolute alcohol plus a 1 min dip in xylene. The sections were secured with a coverslip and the slides examined by light microscopy. The IHC for the enteropathogenic viruses was based on a similar protocol that used as primary antibodies a coronavirus monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Z3A5/8F2; Kansas State University) diluted 1:400; and a rotavirus polyclonal goat antibody (AB 1129; Chemicon) diluted at 1:1600.",

            "text": "In this paper, we present data that demonstrates the morphologic distribution of Giardia parasites in intestinal sections from scouring calves testing negative to other enteric pathogens. In a single calf that was positive to coronavirus and virulent E. coli (Fig. 2) , the Giardia parasites and/or antigen were spatially distributed in areas of microscopically demonstrable enteritis suggesting that under certain circumstances this protozoan may play a role in calf scours. This has been previously implied but unproven by data collected in a number of studies (Xiao et al., 1993; O'Handley et al., 2000; Wade et al., 2000a,b; Appelbee et al., 2003; Trout et al., 2004; McAllister et al., 2005) . Our results are corroborated by the detection of Giardia DNA (Fig. 4) in some of the samples previously found positive for Giardia antigens by a fecal-based ELISA. Whereas the histological changes in intestinal sections from the four of the five Giardia-positive calves were not definitive, the intestinal lesions in the only calf with a Giardia, coronavirus and E. coli mixed infection (Fig. 2) included occasional crypt abscesses; increased mitotic activity in the crypt enterocytes consistent with crypt cell hyperplasia; villous attenuation; infiltration of the lamina propria by low to moderate numbers of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and lesser numbers of eosinophils and macrophages; along with moderate to marked sloughing of the enterocytes in some cases. Whereas these changes cannot be definitively attributed to the Giardia infection, some of them are similar to those reported in other young Giardia-infected scouring non-bovine animals (Quigley et al., 1994; Smith et al., 2004) ; and a contributory role of the intralesional Giardia trophozoites to the development of severe enteritis in the calf cannot be ruled out. A review article on the mechanisms of epithelial dysfunction in human intestinal giardiasis (Olson et al., 1995) reports that this parasite can cause severe enteric disease without penetrating the intestinal epithelium. Based on the conclusions by these workers, it is probable that the numerous Giardia trophozoites seen in the pure Giardia infection may have played a partial role in the development of scours in those calves; this assertion will be investigated in future infectivity studies. The presence of Giardia parasites as seen in the various intestinal sections of Giardia-positive calves may have compromised the integrity of the intestinal mucosa in a way that most probably led to maldigestion and malabsorption leading to diarrhea. Many of the Giardia trophozoites seen in the present study were either found attached to the intact villi, or denuded mucosal areas and/or admixed with sloughed enterocytes within the lumen. Troeger et al. (2007) reported that Giardiainduced intestinal dysfunction in humans involves down-regulation of the tight junction protein claudin-1, and enterocyte apoptosis. Although we did not demonstrate these mechanisms in the present study, most of the Giardia-positive calves had a high level of enterocyte sloughing. This suggests that enterocyte sloughing as reported in humans (Troeger et al., 2007) may be an important pathophysiological mechanism in intestinal giardiasis of calves. However, this needs to be experimentally verified in infectivity studies based on gnotobiotic calves as postmortem autolysis may have confounded the intestinal changes in the present study. Future studies are needed to demonstrate these and other potential enteropathogenic mechanisms of giardiasis in calves if appropriate therapeutic interventions are to be adopted. Moreover, calves could potentially be used as a model for human giardiasis if these mechanisms were established to be similar in both species.",

From a diagnostic viewpoint, this technique appears to have potential for confirming a Giardia diagnosis in dead scouring calves testing positive for Giardia antigens by the fecal ELISA. Only a few studies have attempted to Fig. 4 . Electrophoresis of PCR products in a 1% agarose gel that was stained with ethidium chloride. Duplicate samples from each calf were loaded onto the gel. Lanes 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b are positive for assemblage E Giardia DNA (white arrow) while lanes 3a, 3b, 4a and 4b are negative. investigate coinfections of Giardia spp. with other enteric pathogens of calves (Quigley et al., 1994; Wade et al., 2000b) . In view of this information gap, the likelihood of synergism between Giardia and other enteropathogenic agents in calves needs to be thoroughly investigated. Enhanced mucosal invasion by Giardia trophozoites was seen in intestinal sections from the only calf that tested positive for coronavirus and virulent E. coli. While this observation has no statistical significance and needs to be further substantiated, it seems reasonable to suspect that coinfections of Giardia with viruses, bacteria and parasites might synergistically act to produce more severe intestinal lesions in calves. Plans are underway to conduct controlled infectivity studies to clarify this supposition.",

All the infections in the study were associated with assemblage E, G. duodenalis which is ruminant specific and does not infect humans. We recommend that diagnosticians should screen for Giardia in dead scouring calves and assign a giardiasis diagnosis especially to those calves testing negative for other enteric pathogens. Our data strongly suggest that IHC may be a useful diagnostic tool for confirming a Giardia diagnosis in dead calves with history of clinical diarrhea. The attributes of treating Giardia-positive scouring calves with anti-protozoan agents needs to be revisited and thoroughly evaluated.",
