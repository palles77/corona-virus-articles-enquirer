Obviously this requires differentiation from hypoproteinemic states, vasculitis, thrombophlebitis, lym phadenitis, or other less common diseases. Dyspnea, tachypnea, and grossly distended jugular or mammary veins are possible signs of cardiac disease that may be observed during general inspection of the patient. Weakness and exercise intolerance are other signs that require consideration of cardiac disease. In calves, overt abnormalities such as microphthalmos, wry tail, or absence of a tail signal the possibility of an accompanying ventricular septal defect, and ectopia cordis is grossly apparent by inspection of the thoracic inlet or caudal cervical area. However, many cases of congenital heart malformations occur in the absence of other defects.",

In general, inspection of conjunctival and vulval mucous membrane appearance and refi ll time is preferable. Cyanosis is rare in dairy cattle with the exception of animals that are dying of severe pulmonary disease. However, cattle having advanced heart failure, right to left congenital shunts, and combined cardiopulmonary disease may have cyanotic mucous membranes.

Profi ciency and practice at palpation of major veins is essential before an examiner can differentiate an abnormal fi nding from the normal range of variation found in cattle of various ages and stages of lactation. Normally mammary veins are more sensitive indicators of increased venous pressure than jugular veins and therefore should be palpated routinely during the physical examination. Jugular veins should be observed during the general inspection and again during thoracic auscultation. Jugular veins should not be palpated until the end of the physical examination because many cattle become apprehensive when the neck region is palpated; this apprehension and subsequent excitement could affect baseline parameters or data being collected during the physical examination. This evaluation of the jugular veins, if deemed necessary, should be done at the end of the physical examination during examination of the head.",

            "text": "Evaluation of the jugular veins for pulsation and distention requires differentiation of the \"notorious\" falsejugular pulsation commonly observed in thin-necked dairy cattle from pathologic true jugular pulsation and distention. False or normal jugular pulsation is a product of reverse blood fl ow from atrial contraction at the end of diastole and expansion of the right atrioventricular (AV) valve during systole. Passive jugular fi lling during systole also may contribute, as does a \"kick,\" or referred carotid artery pulsation. False jugular pulsation arises as a wave that winds its way from the thoracic inlet to the mandible when the cow has her head and neck parallel to the ground. When the head and neck are raised, the false jugular pulse may only ascend a portion of the cervical area or may disappear. A true jugular pulse fi lls the whole jugular vein rapidly when the head and neck are parallel to the ground or slightly raised. This rapid fi lling is similar to fi lling a garden hose with the end held off when water to the hose is turned on full force. In addition, distention of the jugular veins is more obvious with true jugular distention as found in right heart failure (Figure 3-1). When confusion exists, the jugular vein may be held off near the ramus of the mandible, blood forced distally toward the thoracic inlet, and the vein observed. Emptying the vein in this fashion will eliminate a false jugular pulse, but a true jugular pulse will refi ll the emptied vein quickly and indicates right heart failure, increased central venous pressure, or right AV valve insuffi ciency. Some examiners suggest applying light pressure that partially occludes the jugular vein at the thoracic inlet, thereby mildly distending the jugular vein. This is thought to eliminate false (or normal) jugular venous pulsations from a referred carotid arterial impact. In general, the degree of gross distention of the jugular veins in cattle having right heart failure is more impressive than the degree of pulsation (see video clip 1).",

Most cattle with heart failure have decreased pulse strength, unevenness of the pulse, increased pulse rate, or a pulse rate that is different than the heart rate.

Many cattle object to stethoscope placement over the sites on the chest wall necessary for cardiac auscultation and will adduct the forelimb tightly against the thorax. This is noticed especially on examining the right side, where cardiac auscultation in cattle requires the stethoscope to be placed very cranial in the axillary area around the third intercostal space. Dairy bulls and large or fat cows have thick chest walls that reduce the intensity of heart sounds. Heart sounds are easier to hear on the left side of normal cattle. The pulmonic valve region is best heard in the left third intercostal space at a level between the shoulder and elbow.

S4 sometimes is heard late in diastole and is related to atrial contraction. In cattle with tachycardia, it has been suggested that S4 may in fact closely precede S1 and be mistaken for a split S1. The tripling or quadrupling of heart sounds that resembles a horse's cantering gait is commonly referred to as a gallop rhythm and occurs in the higher range of normal heart rates or when tachycardia exists in some cows. Gallops are diastolic sounds related to atrial contraction (S4 gallop), to ventricular fi lling (S3), or to both (summation gallop).

Neonatal calves may have normal heart rates as high as 110 to 120 beats/min, but frequently heart rates this high are brought about by the excitement of being handled or in anticipation of being fed. Not everyone agrees on the aforementioned range of normal heart rates for cattle, and several points should be addressed regarding this topic. Oxen and fat, persistently dry cows used only for embryo transfer may have a slower metabolism than lactating dairy cattle. Therefore somewhat like draft horses, these cattle may have heart rates at the low end of the normal range or even less than 60 beats/min. Conversely healthy but excited, nervous, or aggressive cattle may have heart and pulse rates more than 84 beats/min when approached by any examiner. Therefore the range of 60 to 84 beats/min really is an average and must be interpreted in light of the patient, its surroundings, and its intended use. Following the work of McGuirk et al with fasted cattle, a low normal range of 48 beats/min has been proposed. However, fasted healthy cattle seldom are encountered in the world outside of academic settings, and veterinarians are not frequently asked to examine healthy fasted cattle. An exception may be a cow off feed secondary to the classic broken water cup syndrome because she will become anorectic secondary to water deprivation. Sick cattle seldom have a heart rate less than 60 beats/min only because they are anorectic. Sick cattle that do have heart rates less than 60 beats/min usually have a vagal nerve-mediated bradycardia. Therefore 60 to 84 beats/ min is still our preferred normal range for heart rate in adult dairy cattle.",

Although ECG and thoracic radiographs have seldom helped make a defi nitive diagnosis, ultrasound may be very helpful to image nodular or large masses of lymphosarcoma. Thoracocentesis and pericardiocentesis to obtain fl uid for cytologic evaluation are the most helpful ancillary aids when cardiac lymphosarcoma is suspected. A complete blood count (CBC) and assessment of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) antibody status are indicated, but a positive BLV agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) or radioimmunoassay (RIA) test does not ensure an absolute diagnosis because most positive cattle never develop tumors (see the section on Lymphosarcoma in Chapter 15). Therefore simply assuming a cow with a positive BLV test and heart abnormality detected on physical examination has lymphosarcoma may be an incorrect assumption. A double line-positive BLV-AGID may add further weight to the suspected diagnosis, as would the fi nding of a persistent lymphocytosis in a set of CBC results.

This muffl ing of heart sounds usually coexists with squeaky, rubbing sounds and splashing or tinkling sounds, but these sounds are not present in all cases. A fl uid gas interface created by gas forming bacterial organisms in the pericardium creates the most obvious splashing sounds. Lung sounds may not be heard in the ventral third of either hemithorax because of the greatly enlarged pericardial sac's displacement of the lungs dorsally. In addition to these signs, there are two very important clinical facts associated with traumatic pericarditis in dairy cattle: 1. Most cows with traumatic pericarditis were observed by the owner to be ill 7 to 14 days earlier and may or may not have been diagnosed with traumatic reticuloperitonitis at that time. Frequently the signs of illness were vague and nonspecifi c, and veterinary attention may or may not have been requested. Typically these cattle improve or appear recovered from this previous illness only to become ill once again and have signs of cardiac disease. Certainly not all cattle have this twophased clinical course, and some have peracute pericarditis or traumatic myocarditis and die within hours or days. When the history supports a twophased clinical disease, it is assumed the cow transiently \"felt better\" after the foreign body left the reticulodiaphragmatic area and entered the chest, thereby alleviating the peritoneal pain and infl ammation.

However, we have observed patients with acute reticuloperitonitis and acute traumatic pericarditis from a single metallic foreign body that was still lodged in the reticulum and was removed through rumenotomy. These patients had clinically detectable pericardial effusions and radiographic evidence of foreign body penetration of the pericardium. Rumenotomy and intensive bactericidal systemic antibiotics are sometimes suffi cient treatment of peracute or acute pericarditis in such cases. If pericarditis worsens despite systemic antibiotics and rumenotomy to retrieve the foreign body, thoracotomy may then be considered. Rumenotomy probably is most indicated in acute cases for which it is hoped that some portion of the metallic foreign object remains in the reticulum.

Persistent atrial fi brillation raises concerns, lest the long-term condition lead to eventual heart failure. Heart failure has been suspected to result from prolonged (a course of years) atrial fi brillation in horses. Similar suspicions exist in cattle, but we know of no work that confi rms this theory pathologically. In addition, cattle with atrial fi brillation that persists more than 1 month following resolution of a gastrointestinal or medical problem may in fact have myocardial disease causing atrial fi brillation or acquire heart disease because the noncontracting atria will develop progressive dilation that eventually results in tricuspid and mitral valve regurgitation, rather than one simply induced by electrolytes. It also is possible that some cows with persistent atrial fi brillation had it before the onset of their medical or gastrointestinal disease. Therefore discussions of appropriate criteria on which to base treatment are subjective. If medical or surgical therapy fails to resolve the primary illness in cattle also having atrial fi brillation, it is diffi cult to know how much the arrhythmia contributes to ongoing inappetence, depression, and decreased milk production.",

Balanced fl uids may be given concurrently via the opposite jugular vein. 2.

Following this time, quinidine is administered as in (1) above. In all treatment protocols, side effects of quinidine such as diarrhea, rumen hypermotility, and tachycardia must be anticipated. Signs of quinidine toxicity may include arrhythmias other than atrial fi brillation, prolonged QRS complexes, or collapse.

Simplistic explanation of this phenomenon revolves around the fact that cattle have a limited bone marrow neutrophil pool to draw on in an acute emergency. Although the degenerative left shift remains a negative prognostic indicator and a positive indicator of severe infection or endotoxemia, it is so typical in cattle that it must be tempered by the patient's signs and response to treatment before using it as the sole basis of a prognosis. Cattle that have a degenerative left shift will often have a return to normal neutrophil numbers within 4 to 7 days following successful treatment of their acute infections. This time lapse may simply refl ect the time necessary for resolution of a severe infection. If the infection requires more than 1 week for resolution, rebound neutrophilia usually will occur. Chronic infections may cause a neutrophilia, but many cattle with chronic infections such as visceral abscesses, musculoskeletal infections, chronic peritonitis, and other diseases frequently have normal neutrophil numbers despite having obvious infection. Neutrophilia seems more likely in resolving acute or subacute infections than in chronic infection. Certainly some cattle with chronic infections have neutrophilia, but the magnitude of the neutrophilia seldom is dramatic.

Although eosinopenia should accompany lymphopenia when the cause is stress or corticosteroid administration, eosinophil counts have limited value in this regard. Absolute lymphocytosis that is transient is rare in dairy cattle and when present usually is associated with a neutrophilia in patients recovering from acute infection. Lymphocytosis that is persistent and repeatable usually indicates infection with BLV. Persistent lymphocytosis (PL) is a separately inherited condition that develops in association with BLV infection in certain lines of cattle. The Bendixen method of control of BLV was based on elimination of cattle with PL until a more modern understanding of the disease evolved. Cattle that are BLV positive and have PL may have a greater risk of developing lymphosarcoma than those cattle that are BLV positive without PL but this is controversial. In one study, PL was present in approximately one third of cattle infected with BLV. However, these percentages may vary in individual herds because genetic predispositions affect the trait of PL in response to BLV infection. The lymphocytosis in cattle with PL is generally refractory to stress or corticosteroid treatment. True lymphocytic leukemia does occur in a small percentage of cattle that develop lymphosarcoma following infection with BLV. Lymphocyte counts may range from 30,000 to 100,000 in such cases, and immature lymphocytes and lymphoblasts may be observed.",

Idiopathic thrombocytopenia patients that have persistent or recurrently low platelet counts of less than 25,000 and bleeding should have bone marrow aspirates evaluated. If the bone marrow is normal, low dose corticosteroids may be used in an effort to increase platelet numbers by increasing thrombocytopoiesis and counteracting a variety of immune mechanisms that may contribute to platelet destruction. Dexamethasone is preferable in our experience and may be therapeutic at doses as low as 0.05 mg/kg once daily. Most adult patients can be further reduced to 0.02 mg/kg once daily after 5 days.

Clinical signs of bleeding and thrombosis represent overstimulation of coagulation within vessels that eventually depletes coagulation factors to such a degree that bleeding evolves as a major sign.

In addition, moderate to severe anemia may be apparent resulting from internal or external blood loss and is apparent based on mucous membrane pallor, elevated heart rate, and elevated respiratory rate. Hypoproteinemia also is present when blood loss has been severe. Other less common clinical signs simply refl ect bleeding into unusual locations as a result of incidental trauma. For example, seizures or neurologic signs may result from skull trauma. Prolonged bleeding may become obvious following minor surgical procedures such as dehorning in subclinical cattle. Diagnosis. Clinical signs, history of exposure to sweet clover forages, or potential exposure to a coumarintype rodenticide coupled with a prolonged prothrombin time and possibly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time support the diagnosis when no other clotting abnormalities are identifi ed.

Analysis of blood, liver, or feedstuffs for dicoumarol may be available at some diagnostic or toxicology laboratories. Treatment. All affected animals should receive vitamin Kl (1.0 mg/kg subcutaneously or IM). Treatment should be repeated twice daily and continue for at least 5 days. Affected animals that are severely anemic should receive 2 to 6 L of fresh whole blood in transfusions from healthy donor cattle (see also Chapter 2).
