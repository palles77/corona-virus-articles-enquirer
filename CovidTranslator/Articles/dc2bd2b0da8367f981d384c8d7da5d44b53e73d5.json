            "text": "The spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been faster than any other coronaviruses that have succeeded in crossing the animal-human barrier. There is concern that this new virus will spread around the world as did the previous two HCoVs-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-each of which caused approximately 800 deaths in the years 2002 and 2012, respectively. Thus far, 11,268 deaths have been reported from the 258,842 confirmed infections in 168 countries. Main methods: In this study, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the newly emerged coronavirus is modeled, validated, and then targeted using different anti-polymerase drugs currently on the market that have been approved for use against various viruses. Key findings: The results suggest the effectiveness of Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 since they tightly bind to its RdRp. In addition, the results suggest guanosine derivative (IDX-184), Setrobuvir, and YAK as top seeds for antiviral treatments with high potential to fight the SARS-CoV-2 strain specifically. Significance: The availability of FDA-approved anti-RdRp drugs can help treat patients and reduce the danger of the mysterious new viral infection COVID-19. The drugs mentioned above can tightly bind to the RdRp of the SARS-CoV-2 strain and thus may be used to treat the disease. No toxicity measurements are required for these drugs since they were previously tested prior to their approval by the FDA.

Additionally, the WHO distributed interim guidance for laboratories that carry out the testing for the newly-emerged outbreak, as well as infection prevention and control guidance (Organization, 2020a, b) . The COVID-19 pneumonia is suspected of having originated in a seafood market, with an unknown animal being responsible for the emergence of the novel virus (Hui et al., 2020) . There are now surveillance borders around the globe, attempting to prevent the spread of the new mysterious coronavirus (Parr, 2020) . Just two months ago, in mid-January, only 41 cases had been confirmed to be COVID-19 positive, leaving one person dead and 7 in critical care (Yang, 2020) . These numbers are continually increasing each day, and the number of confirmed cases at the time of this writing has now exceeded 258,000, with 11,268 confirmed deaths, mostly in China, Europe, and the Islamic Republic of Iran.

We used the SARS HCoV solved structure (PDB ID: 6NUR, chain A) as a template for building our model since it was the most sequelogous solved structure (97.08% sequence identity) to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. 6NUR is a SARS HCoV non-structural protein 12 (nsp12) solved structure (cryo-electron microscopy) with 3.1 \u00c5 resolution, which was deposited in the protein data bank in 2019 (Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019) .

Moreover, the compounds IDX-184, Setrobuvir, and YAK can tightly bind to the newly-emerged coronavirus RdRp, hence contradicting the function of the proteins leading to viral eradication. Additionally, IDX-184 can be used as a seed for new compounds specific against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp active site. Further optimization of the compounds using the high-quality model of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp may result in a perfect compound able to stop the newly-emerged infection.",

On the other hand, two metal interactions were formed between IDX-184 and the active site residue D652 of the RdRp, while only one salt bridge built with D514. For the approved drug Ribavirin, the only interactions established upon docking were the 13 H-bonds with W508, Y510, K512, C513, D514, N582, D651 (3), A653 (3), and W691 of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The same pattern was found for Tenofovir, but with a reduced number of H-bonds (5 H-bonds with W508, D652, A653, W691, and E702), which was reflected in the binding energy values (-7.8 and -6.9 kcal/mol for Ribavirin and Tenofovir, respectively). On the other hand, Sofosbuvir formed 7 H-bonds (W508 (3), K512 (2), A653, and W691) and two hydrophobic contacts (Y510 and D651) with the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.",
