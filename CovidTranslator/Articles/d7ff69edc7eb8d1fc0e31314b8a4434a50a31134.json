            "text": "The objective of this study was to identify risk factors for morbidity and mortality of bobby calves across the whole dairy supply chain in New Zealand. A case-control study was carried out in the 2016 spring calving season. A total of 194 bobby calves, comprising 38 cases (calves that died or were condemned for health or welfare reasons before the point of slaughter) and 156 controls (calves deemed acceptable and presented for slaughter) were included in the study. Case and control calves were selected by veterinarians located at 29 processing premises across New Zealand. Information regarding management of selected calves on-farm, during transport and at the processor was obtained retrospectively via questionnaires administered to supplying farmers, transport operators and processing premises personnel. Associations between management variables and calf mortality (death or condemnation) were examined using multivariable logistic regression models. Factors associated with an increased risk of calf mortality included time in the farm of origin's calving season, duration of travel from farm to the processor and processing slaughter schedule (same day or next day). Every additional week into the farm's calving season increased the odds of mortality by a factor of 1.2 (95%CI 1.06, 1.35). Similarly, each additional hour of travel time increased the odds of mortality by a factor of 1.45 (95% CI 1.18, 1.76). Risk of mortality was significantly greater for calves processed at premises with a next day slaughter schedule than those processed at premises with a same day slaughter schedule (OR 3.82, 95% CI 1.51, 9.67). However, when the data set was limited to those cases that died or were condemned in the yards (i.e. excluding calves that were dead or condemned on arrival) the effect of same day slaughter was not significant. In order to reduce bobby calf mortality and morbidity, transport duration should be kept as short as possible and a same day slaughter schedule applied. While these factors can be regulated, New Zealand's pastoral dairy system means that calves will inevitably be transported for slaughter across several months each spring. Although farm management factors did not apparently influence the risk of mortality in this study, the effect of time in farm's calving season suggests there may be farm-management related factors that change over the season. This requires further investigation.",

Bobby calves are defined as unweaned calves that are transported for slaughter at meat processing premises for human consumption or pet food, usually within the first week of life (Anonymous, 2015) . In New Zealand, around 4 million dairy calves are born between July and September each year (Anonymous, 2017b) . Approximately one quarter of these are kept as replacement dairy animals (Hickson was 0.25 %, dropping to 0.12 % in 2017 (Anonymous, 2017a , equating to between 4800 and 5500 calves per year. While the current mortality rate is low, it may be important to further reduce this for animal welfare, economic and reputational reasons by understanding and addressing the underlying risk factors in each stage of the supply chain. Factors associated with the rearing, management, handling, transport and yarding of bobby calves at the processor before slaughter have the potential to impact on their health and welfare, which may in turn influence mortality rate.",

Case and control calves were selected by Ministry for Primary Industries Verification Services (MPI VS) veterinarians at meat processing premises around New Zealand.

For the pairs of continuous variables correlation was assessed using the Pearson correlation coefficient, whereas the Kendall's correlation was used for the pairs of categorical variables. In both cases one variable in the pair was included in the model if the correlation exceeded an absolute value of 0.7. Thirdly, a multivariable model was constructed that included all variables that were associated with the outcome at P < 0.20. In the fourth step, a preliminary multivariable model was created by stepwise removal of the least significant variable (assessed using the Deviance test statistic) until all remaining variables were statistically significant at P < 0.05. When a variable was dropped from the model, changes in co-efficient and standard error were examined. The fifth step was an assessment of whether the continuous variables modelled had a linear relationship with the logit through the inclusion of a quadratic term. The quadratic term was retained in the model, or the variable converted to a categorical variable, if it significantly improved the fit as determined by the likelihood ratio test statistic. In the final step, the model was applied to the restricted data set (excluding cases that died or were condemned in the yards).

Such changes might include alterations in staffing or staff behaviour, or in features of bobby calf management. An example of the latter might be management of bedding in the calf pens, such that pathogen load might increase as the farm's calving season progressed, increasing the risk of infection later in the season. The severity of infectious disease in calves has been shown to be influenced by management and hygiene practices (Castro-Hermida et al., 2002) as well as immune status (Meganck et al., 2014) . Furthermore, disease transmission among infected calves may Table 3 Reasons cited for condemnation of case calves (n = 28) that were condemned on arrival (n = 18) or in yards (n = 10) at the processing premises. also be affected by management factors such as housing, group size and hygiene (Trotz-Williams et al., 2007; Lorenz et al., 2011) , which may change over a farm's season. Although no significant associations were found in the multivariable model between farm variables such as frequency of bedding change or housing cleaning/disinfection and calf mortality in the present study, it should be noted that the number of case calves was relatively small (n = 38 for the full data set and n = 18 in the restricted data set). In addition, given that considerable variation was observed among farms in factors such as frequency of cleaning/ disinfection of housing and frequency of bedding change, the associations between time in the farm's season and such factors may warrant further investigation. Furthermore, research into the prevalence failure of passive transfer (FPT) of maternal antibodies in New Zealand dairy calves found that FPT was more prevalent in the middle compared to the early calving period (Cuttance et al., 2017b) . If this were also the case for calves in the present study, this may have contributed to the observed seasonal effect on risk of mortality.",

This contrasts with the present study, in which transport duration was significantly associated with mortality in yards as well as overall. This apparent difference may be due to the definitions applied to death/ condemnation in yards. In the present study, death or condemnation in yard could occur at any point prior to presentation for slaughter, whereas the previous study defined this as 'dead overnight', implying death or condemnation after overnight holding only. According to the Victorian Code of Accepted Farming Practice for the Welfare of Cattle bobby calves held overnight must be fed as soon as practicable (Anonymous, 1996) .

This was unexpected, given that these latter calves were more likely to be impacted by a policy of next day slaughter. Table 6 Frequency and percentage of case and control calves that were selected at processing premises with same day and next day slaughter schedules. There are two possible reasons for these findings. Firstly, calves that were classified as dead or condemned on arrival included animals that died/were condemned within two hours of arrival. It is plausible that assessors at premises reporting a next day schedule would be more likely to condemn a 'borderline' animal to minimise suffering and/or to have the death associated with transport rather than with the processor. Secondly, we may not have detected a true association in the restricted data set because of a lack of statistical power as there were only 18 cases in the CIY/DIY subset. A post hoc power analysis estimated that the power to detect an association in the limited data set was relatively low (0.43). It is not possible to postulate as to which reason is more likely.

However, retrospective data collection meant that information on individual calf age, health and immune status or age at separation from the dam was not available. Therefore, the influence of these factors on calf mortality could not be assessed. Previous studies of dairy calf mortality on New Zealand farms have identified disease status and failure of passive transfer of immunity (FPT) as risk factors for mortality. For example, a prospective study of calf and replacement heifer mortality on 32 New Zealand dairy farms in 2015 found that risk of mortality on-farm in the first week of life was higher in herds with disease problems, such as scours, and among calves that were removed from the dam within 12 h of birth and handfed colostrum (Cuttance et al., 2017a) . A related study investigating passive transfer of immunity and colostrum quality found that calves that remained with the dam for \u223c24 h had lower prevalence of FPT (Cuttance et al., 2017b) . The authors postulated that feeding poor quality, pooled, stored colostrum (with low antibody and high bacterial concentrations) to calves less that 24 h old was responsible for the observed effects (Denholm et al., 2017) . The present study collected information on colostrum feeding practices (e.g. true or mixed) and quality management (whether or not colostrum quality was checked) on-farm. Neither of these factors were found to significantly influence mortality risk in the final multivariable model. Given the relatively small sample size in the present study, along with the small number of farms that reported checking colostrum quality, further investigation of the effects of colostrum management on bobby calf mortality may be informative.",

Although travel time and slaughter schedule can be, and are now, subject to regulation, time in season is more difficult to regulate due to the wide calving spread in New Zealand's pastoral-based dairy system. However, the identification of this as a risk factor provides some insight into factors of potential importance on farm. It is possible that further education and extension within the industry could be effective in reducing animal welfare compromise and mortality associated with seasonal effects. As the present study design did not permit the collection of information on individual calf age or disease status, the influence of these factors on risk of mortality in bobby calves should also be investigated.",
