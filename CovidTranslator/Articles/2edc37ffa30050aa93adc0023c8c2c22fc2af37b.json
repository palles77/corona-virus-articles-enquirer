Maximum likelihood (ML) method with codon-substitution models is a powerful statistic tool for detecting amino acid sites under positive selection and adaptive evolution. We analyzed the hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope protein-coding sequences from 18 general geno/ subtypes worldwide, and found 4 amino acid sites under positive selection. Since these sites are located in different immune epitopes, it is reasonable to anticipate that our study would have potential values in biomedicine. It also suggests that the ML method is an effective way to detect adaptive evolution in virus proteins with relatively high genetic diversity.",

Detecting the adaptive evolution would be helpful for better understanding of bio-evolutionary mechanism and corresponding variation in structure and function [1] . The nonsynonymous-synonymous substitution rate ratio (d N /d S ) is an important indicator of selective pressure at the protein-coding gene, with d N /d S = 1 meaning neutral mutation, d N /d S <1 purifying selection, and d N /d S >1 diversifying positive selection (i.e. adaptive evolution). In comparison with a large amount of neutral mutations and purifying selections, positive selection is rare and hardly detected effectively because it often just occurs on a few of sites or during a short period [1] . In particular, for some protein-coding sequences with high genetic diversity that might result from relatively high mutation rates or long evolutionary history, it is much difficult to infer whether positive selection exists. For example, hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a type of RNA viruses with high mutation rates, and its genotypes have emerged in determining the clinic variation, main features of chronic infection and duration of antiviral therapy. Although the rapid variation of HCV has attracted the attention of virologists and evolution biologists, it is still unclear how HCV evades the host immune response and the mechanism of chronic infection [2] .",

            "text": "Envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 of HCV are involved in virus attaching to the host cell as well as in virus endocytosis and fusion with host membrane. E2 protein contains two highly variable regions called hypervariable regions 1 and 2 (HVR1 and HVR2) and two CD81-binding sites. As one of the receptors of E2 protein [3] , CD81 is a bridge between virus and host cell. HVR1 is implicated in the SCARB1-mediated cell entry. It was reported that despite strong amino acid sequence variability related to strong pressures towards change, the chemicophysical properties and conformation of HVR1 were highly conserved. The conservation of positively charged residues located at specific sequence positions of HVR1 indicates that HVR1 is involved in interactions with negatively charged molecules on host cell surface. This possible interaction probably plays a role in host cell recognition and attachment [4] . HVR2 and CD81-binding sites may be involved in sensitivity and/or resistance to IFN-alpha therapy. It is therefore considered that HCV evades the host immune response through mutation in some amino acid sites of envelope proteins, which result in recognition error during HCV contacting host cell. These mutations will be fixed under pressure driven by host immune system environment and form the adaptive evolution of HCV genomes.",

            "text": "Previous studies focused on exploration of the adaptive evolution within an individual HCV subtype. For example, positively selected amino acid sites in the entire coding sequences of HCV subtype1b were identified [5] . The increasing availability of data storing in HCV databases allows us to analyze HCV genome evolution on a large scale of genetic diversity from more quantitative frameworks based on statistical inference [6, 7] . Technologically, a number of advanced methods have been proposed to reconstruct ancestral sequences or estimate the parameters under different substitution models when calculating nonsynonymous-synonymous rate ratio. For example, when all the sites evolve independently in one substitution model, a parsimony approach can be used to infer ancestral sequences and compute substitution numbers of different types. However, estimation of parameters by the parsimony approach may be biased because it does not account for multiple substitutions on one site. The maximum likelihood (ML) method is another way to estimate model parameters and more strict. It is employed not only to select the best phylogenic tree that fit the real data [1] , but also to detect select pressure on sites under different codon substitution models, especially for amino acid sites undergoing positive selection [8] . The purpose of this study is therefore to use the ML method [9] to infer adaptive evolution and positively selected amino acid sites of HCV envelope protein entire coding sequences containing all 6 HCV genotypes.",

We used three pairs of models to form three LRTs: M0 (one-ratio) and M3 (discrete), M1a (nearly neutral) and M2a (positive selection), and M7 (\u03b2 ) and M8 (\u03b2 & \u03c9 ). The simplest model, M0, assumes one \u03c9 for all sites. Model M1a (nearly neutral) allows two classes of sites with 0< \u03c9 0 <1 and \u03c9 1 = 1 in proportions p 0 of conserved sites and p 1 = 1\u2212p 0 of neutral sites, respectively. Based on M1a, M2a (positive selection) adds an additional class of sites with frequency p 2 = 1\u2212p 0 \u2212p 1 and an \u03c9 2 estimated from the data. M3 (discrete) uses an unconstrained discrete distribution to model heterogeneous \u03c9 ratios among sites. M7 (\u03b2 ) assumes a \u03b2 (p,q)-distribution for 0\u2264\u03c9\u22641. M8 (\u03b2 & \u03c9 ) adds to M7 an extra category, with proportion p 1 of sites with \u03c9 1 , while the rest of sites (at frequency p 0 = 1\u2212p 1 ) have \u03c9 from the \u03b2 (p,q)-distribution between 0 and 1. This model can be compared with M7 to test the presence of positive sites using a likelihood-ratio test (LRT) [19] . In this study, site-specific models were used with Codeml in the PAML 3.14b package [9] . We tested positive selection over sites of coding sequences by comparing twice the log-likelihood differences between M1a vs. M2a and M7 vs. M8 with a \u03c7 2 distribution in the LRT.",

The results of identifying positively selected amino acid sites in the coding region of E1 are summarized in Table 2 . The LRTs of adaptive evolution suggested that the model of one \u03c9 ratio for all sites (M0) was rejected when compared with model M3 (2\u03b4L = 569.66, P<0.01, df = 4). The LRT statistic for comparing M1a (nearly neutral) and M2a (positive selection) showed that M2a did not have precedence over M1a (2\u03b4L = 0, df = 2). Indeed, model M2a and M1a had the same likelihood value and the estimations of parameters under these models were similar. In M2a, p 1 and p 2 could be combined into one because \u03c9 2 = 1. In this way, M2a was equivalent to M1a. Therefore, we could not infer positive selection from this comparison. Model M8 was significantly prior to M7 (2\u03b4L = 6.24, P<0.05, df = 2). Model M3 provided three proportions of sites, p 0 , p 1 and p 2 with \u03c9 ratio of 0.0141, 0.1134, and 0.3231 respectively. It suggested a large proportion of sites (~85%) under strong purifying selection. Another piece of evidence for E1 gene being negatively selected was that \u03c9 in M8 was no greater than 1.",

[22] cloned HCV E1E2 full-length nucleotide sequences generated from serum samples of 4 chronically infected patients and identified 11 amino acid sites undergoing patient-specific adaptive evolution. In this study, we detected 4 amino acids sites of E2 protein under positive selection. Two of these sites were proved in Brown's work. Note that a region including the N-terminal 27-31 amino acid sites in E2 is known to be the most variable and is called hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) [23, 24] . This region is surface-exposed [25] and has been proposed as a major target of the immune response probably because its hypervariable is correlated with immune evasion [26] [27] [28] . For all of the positively selected amino acid sites located in HVR1 of E2 protein and in some immune epitopes, adaptive evolution of HCV could be the consequence of the environment pressure directly driven by host immune response. Recent studies revealed more information about how HCV escaping from host immune system response, but more comprehensive and careful research should be done to make clear the role of immune evasion in HCV chronically infection and explain the mechanism of HCV evolution involving immunology and virology. In other words, the positively selected sites' location indicated the immunogenicity of these sites and they might be candidate vaccination targets against HCV. The composite vaccines containing these different amino acid residues at the positively selected sites located in immune epitopes would be effective to preventing proliferation of escape mutants [5] . No amino acid sites exhibited positive selection within E1 protein in this study. It was consistent with the report from Brown et al. [22] . The possible reason was that E1 was unlikely to be surface-exposed [29] and not a major target for the host antibody response. It was reported that E1 protein was a poor natural immunogen for humoral response [30] . In other words, E1 protein was not under strong selective pressure of adaptive evolution driven by immune response.",

Four of these sites were located in E1 and three located in E2. It is different from the results obtained from this study. The possible reasons may be: (1) the strategies to reconstruct ancestral sequences are different. Adaptsite, the program employed in Suzuki and Gojobori's work, uses maximum parsimony method to perform reconstruction while Codeml uses a likelihood reconstruction. Thus, the reconstructed ancestral states may be different. In general, the two implementations produce similar results in dataset with high similarity among sequences. However, ML provides a more reliable result when used to analyze small-size dataset with relatively high diversity in sequence similarity [31, 32] . They focused on HCV subtype 1b [5, 33] , and deleted any sequences with gap by pairwise-alignment with reference sequence (HCV-JS) to obtain dataset with highly similar sequences. Our study used sequences containing 18 HCV geno/subtypes with a relatively large scale of genetic diversity; thus the ML method was adopted; (2) the methods to estimate branch length are different. Adaptsite uses a neighbor-joining algorithm to estimate branch length [34] while Codeml uses a codon model M0 to do it; (3) for codons that are neighbors of stop codons, Adaptsite and Codeml count sites differently, e.g. TAC and TAT, Adaptsite counts S = 1 and N = 2, while Codeml gives 0.429 and 2.571; (4) missing data are handled differently. Adaptsite requires dataset without gaps [34] while Codeml implemented in this work allows sequences data with some gaps; and (5) mutation rates in RNA viruses are several orders of magnitude higher than those in DNA based life-forms. By limiting genome size and content, RNA virus genome can avoid deleterious mutation accumulation. It brings virus genomes to be inclined to concerted evolution or parallel evolution and own similar codon substitution patterns [35] . Therefore, it is not difficult to understand why most of amino acid sites undergoing purifying selection of genetic constraints though HCV envelope proteins still possess high mutation rates. Our study focused on a larger scale of genetic diversity than previous work. This study might probably miss particular positively selected amino acid sites of individual subtype but produce more general sites under positive Darwinian selection to all HCV genotypes.",

            "text": "The parsimony method of Suzuki and Gojobori [33] and the maximum likelihood method developed by Nielsen and Yang [8] are two widely used methods for detecting natural selection in homologous protein-coding sequences. However, they have their own pros and cons. The former may fail to infer positively selected sites when the branches of the phylogenetic tree are long because the maximum parsimony method is not fit for multiple substitutions. In contrast, multiple substitutions in the Nielsen and Yang method may be corrected by assuming the codon substitution model. Suzuki also attempted to employ ML to modify previous method [36] . Our study showed an application of ML method in detecting adaptive evolution in HCV envelope protein-coding sequences based on 18 geo/ subtypes. It provided an instance for similar work of high diversity homologous genes analysis. Indeed, using ML method to infer adaptive evolution has been an effective strategy for some emerging viruses such as SARS-CoV. In this way we had successfully explored the adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV spike protein [37] .",
