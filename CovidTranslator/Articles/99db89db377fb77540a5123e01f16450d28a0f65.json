            "text": "Similar to other urban areas where food and shelter are abundant, the zoological garden of Rio de Janeiro has dealt for years with a colony of feral or semi-feral domestic cats. A survey was conducted during 2002-2004 as a follow-up to a previous study in 2001 of the cat colony to identify pathogens circulating among the population and to annually follow the status of the cats to analyze morbidity coefficients and associations among infections and infestations identified in the colony. During the 3 years of the present study, 75 cats were sampled at least once, including 44 that were caught and examined only once, 14 that were examined twice, and 17 that were examined three times. For each cat that was caught, records were kept regarding sex, age, general health, and the presence of ectoparasites. Each year, a blood sample was taken for hematologic testing, platelet count, hemoparasite detection, antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, and retrovirus detection. Blood counts were within normal range for the majority of cats tested. Feline immunodeficiency virus, fleas, and lice were detected in all years; however, incidence rates for each of these varied significantly throughout the years. Prevalence of Cytauxzoon spp., Mycoplasma spp., T. gondii infections were variable among the 3 years, although differences were not significant. Prevalence of feline leukemia virus increased significantly over the 3 years. Mycoplasma spp. and flea infestations were significantly associated, but no other associations among the pathogens were detected. Over the 3 years, the rate of new cat introductions decreased, and the pathogens showed a tendency to disseminate throughout the colony; however, there was virtually no evidence of clinically detectable disease. Therefore, it seems that stabilizing the population by a judicious control program facilitated the distribution of the pathogens throughout the colony, while the general well-being of the cats was not seriously affected. #",

Toxoplasmosis is one of the zoonoses most frequently related to the presence of cats, which are a common source of oocysts in urban environments. Felines are generally asymptomatic but may develop nonspecific clinical signs, including fever, weight loss, dyspnea, polypnea, jaundice, abdominal discomfort, uveitis, or retinochoroiditis, if the disease manifests as toxoplasmosis (Dubey and Lappin, 2006) . T. gondii is widely disseminated among mammals, known to be frequent among feral cats (Nutter et al., 2004) and detection of antibodies is an important screening tool to identify which cats have been previously infected because these animals are not expected to re-shed oocysts. Cats normally preserve their immunity and seldom re-shed oocysts (Martins and Viana, 1998; Dubey and Lappin, 2006) , although there are isolated reports of cats that were previously seropositive that resumed shedding of oocysts (Dubey, 1995) .",

Controlling transmission of these viruses is difficult because they are transmitted directly, causing both chronic and subclinical infections (Hartmann, 2006; Sellon and Hartmann, 2006) . Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) exposes the infected host to highly malignant neoplasias. Detection of the virus may be intermittent, and transmission occurs through prolonged and intimate contact as well as by infected queens to her kittens either in utero or through the milk (Avery, 2001; Mehl, 2001; Hartmann, 2006) . Cats infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) present with various clinical signs, depending on which opportunistic infection is present. The most common infections seen in these cats include calicivirus, herpesvirus, Chlamydia spp., Mycoplasma spp., and T. gondii (Sellon and Hartmann, 2006) . Once cats develop detectable antibodies, they tend to remain seropositive.",

A colony of 52 free-ranging cats living on a farm in the United Kingdom had no animals infected with FeLV, Chlamydia psittaci, or Ctenocephalides felis (Yamaguchi et al., 1996) . However, feline parvovirus antibodies were detected in 96% of cats, coronavirus antibodies in 84%, T. gondii antibodies in 62%, FIV antibodies in 53%, and poxvirus antibodies in 2%. M. haemofelis was detected in 42% of examined blood samples, and eggs of Toxocara cati (91%) and Toxascaris leonina (82%) were present in the feces. In the United States, a colony of 80 free-roaming cats living on the campus of the University of California, Davis were caught during a capture-neutering-release program. Among these animals, 12% were infected with Mycoplasma haemominutum, 8% with Mycoplasma spp., 54% by ascarids, 26% by tapeworms, and 13% by coccidia (Levy et al., 1999) . During the 2001 study, pathogens shown to infect the free-roaming cats of the zoological garden of the city of Rio de Janeiro (RIOZOO) included piroplasms, Mycoplasma spp., and FIV (Mendes- de-Almeida et al., 2004) . The only ectoparasite species found was C. felis. No FeLV antigens were detected.",

Therefore, finding up to 72.3% of the cats infested indicates heavy infestation of the environment. The association observed between fleas infestation and Mycoplasma spp. infection reinforces that fleas are important vectors of this bacterial infection, especially because the pre-patent period of the infection is only a few days and the increase was observed in the same year (Tasker, 2001; Harvey, 2006) .",

In 2004, 39.4% of the population was infected, showing that the infection is easily transmitted from cat to cat. Interestingly, although lice were present in the population since the first year of observation, and as FeLV spread throughout the colony, infestations by lice also spread. As the time went by the social organization of the colony became stronger (Mendes-de-Almeida et al., 2006) and the contact of the individuals intimate, therefore, transmission of both FeLV and lice was facilitated. Lice infestations are generally considered a clinical sign of poor health in cats, although no significant association between these two occurrences could be established. Nevertheless, the fact that the number of FeLV-infected and lice-infested cats increased at similar rates suggests that FeLV was the pathogen with the highest morbidity potential.",

Since the members of the cat population roaming in the RIOZOO were asymptomatic, despite being infected with FIVand other transmissible infections, we decided not to interfere with the population dynamics. Therefore, no animal was euthanized or removed. Thus it seems that, as long as the animals show no clinical signs that justify euthanasia, it should be avoided (Levy et al., 2001) . On the other hand, the prevalence of FIV infection increased significantly in the year that a higher migration of animals was observed (Mendes- de-Almeida et al., 2006) , and may have been due to greater disputes and fights. Therefore, from a disease control perspective, euthanasia could be a solution when migrations cannot be adequately controlled.",

However, the fact that three cats seropositive for T. gondii in 2002 were seronegative when converted to FIV seropositive does bring about the question as to the shedding status of those three cats after retrovirus infection, since Dubey (1996) has reported that, although rare, cats previously found to be seropositive for T. gondii antibodies subsequently resumed shedding of oocysts. Feces were not examined for T. gondii oocysts in this study, so it cannot be determined whether these two cats or other new introductions into the colony were shedding. The fact that seronegative animals (cats that would most likely be shedding oocysts) were primarily individuals that recently infiltrated the colony sustains the theory that methods, such as capture, elimination, or relocation of cats where ''repopulation'' cannot be avoided are not indicated if there may be an increased risk of environmental contamination with T. gondii.",
