Prior to the 19th century, infection syndromes were often described better by artists and writers than by scientists. This began to change as microbes were better understood, and for the past 150 years, many ancient diseases such as smallpox, polio and measles have been explained and controlled. However, over the past three decades, there has been a constant stream of newly identified pathogens that have received increasing attention. The approach to these new pandemic threats has generally been reactive, and specific medical interventions have not been available in time to make a substantial impact on the immediate outbreak. Technical advances have provided tools that have made a more proactive approach feasible and a critical determinant for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) established by the UN (United Nations) in 2015 ( Table 1 ). The introduction of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) into human populations is often a consequence of economic development that brings zoonotic reservoirs in closer proximity to people, and the spread of EIDs has contributed to a number of inter-related factors that affect global human wellness. Notably, the control of infectious disease is interdependent with progress toward the 17 UN SDGs 3 . Therefore, prevention of and preparedness for epidemics should be conducted in the context of meeting SDGs.",

While antimicrobial resistance is also of considerable concern, the prospects for pandemic spread of a bacterial or fungal pathogen seem less likely. Nonetheless, the spread of diseases such as plague, cholera, tuberculosis and, more recently, Legionnaire's disease, invasive streptococcal disease and toxic-shock syndrome would present considerable risk. Thus, there is a need for rapid diagnosis, definition of transmission pathways and availability of antimicrobial agents. Here we will focus on newly emerging viral diseases, particularly those identified over the past three decades, during which the mobility of humans, transmission vectors and viruses has been on a steep upward trajectory, and consider the immunological tools and new technologies that could help address this problem. Improving scientific preparedness for the next pandemic threat can be divided into four broad categories, which we will consider in turn below.",

As suggested below, this type of pre-existing information for flaviviruses substantially accelerated timelines for the development of a vaccine against Zika virus. Immunologists and virologists will be essential for the refinement of approaches for testing the authenticity of antigenic surfaces. For example, defining antibody lineages associated with broad neutralizing activity, as has been done for HIV [5] [6] [7] and influenza virus 8 , can guide the development of epitopespecific germline versions of -B cell antigen receptor-expressing Raji cells that can serve as a tool for screening antigen designs 9 . This has facilitated the development of novel antigens for HIV 10 and influenza virus 11 . While many of the rules that govern the immunogenicity of vaccine antigens displaying isolated epitopes are yet to be defined, having antibodies with the desired functional properties to confirm the preservation of targeted epitopes in vaccine antigens is a critical part of rational design 12, 13 . Genes encoding the relevant human antibodies can also be built into mice for in vivo assessment of antigenicity 14 . Assays to define the fundamental mechanisms of immunity for prototypic pathogens will guide the approach for vaccine antigen delivery and will directly inform the types of assays needed to define correlates of protection. Those will probably be distinct from the assays needed for surveillance and diagnosis. Likewise, animal-model development is essential, but it is important to distinguish the adequacy of model development for basic research from the adequacy of models needed to support regulatory filings for product licensure. For example, models for studying susceptibility to infection, tropism, pathogenesis and basic mechanisms of immunity will probably use challenge routes and doses different from those used by models attempting to faithfully replicate the infectious exposure that occurs in humans. Such refinements will facilitate accurate bridging of protective immune responses to human immunogenicity data needed to satisfy the requirements for licensure based on animal efficacy (for example, US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Animal Rule 21 CFR 601.90).",

The rapid succession of the West African Ebola epidemic and the Zika epidemic in South and Central America and the Caribbean galvanized organizations concerned about EIDs and focused the attention of the media as never before. There might now be the political will to support a more-organized global approach to advanced preparation for the next pandemic threat, and much of this could be accomplished within the context of sustainable development. Ideas for funding and accomplishing more-rapid advanced development of biologicals for outbreak intervention have also evolved out of necessity in response to more-frequent public-health emergencies. For example, within the US Department of Health and Human Services, the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response was established in 2007; under the auspices of this office, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority can rapidly purchase and support the development of medical countermeasures for pandemic threats. The WHO established a Department of Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases in 2011 to better prepare for and respond to EIDs. New organizations have proposed funding for advanced preparation of vaccine candidates before future and predictable infectious disease outbreaks of global concern occur. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations was motivated largely by the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. It proposes to establish a system to fund the development of vaccines in advance of the next epidemic and to prepare products and processes that allow rapid deployment and testing in an outbreak setting 20, 21 . Other proposals for biodefense preparedness organizations call for advanced funding of companies with established platform technologies that could be used to develop vaccines against pathogens with pandemic potential, define scalable commercial processes, evaluate safety and immunogenicity through phase II and stockpile a substantial number of doses for efficacy testing in the event of future outbreaks 22 . Therefore, it is reasonable to ask what new technologies are available to address emerging viral diseases in a more proactive way and what can be learned from recent outbreaks that will inform preparations for future infectious disease threats.",

Therefore, we suggest that the focus for vaccines Several new or improved technologies over the past 10 years have provided the tools needed for rational vaccine design. They have also created opportunities for more-rapid vaccine development. Structure-guided antigen design is a central feature of this new paradigm. Atomic-level detail of antigenic surfaces, the ability to identify monoclonal antibodies via the cloning of immunoglobulin-encoding genes from specifically sorted B cells, and high-throughput sequencing technology have provided the basis for selecting antigen targets for vaccine-induced immune responses to initiate the design cycle. CRISPR-Cas9-like targeted gene editing has made it possible for animal models to be established on the basis of knowledge of receptor requirements for viral entry and restriction factors that might be species specific. Analysis of immune responses by flow cytometry to define the phenotype of individual cells on the basis of protein-or gene-expression patterns can provide information on repertoire and temporal patterns of the immune response for bridging endpoints to human infection or vaccination. Knowledge of the structure, function and epitope locations for class I fusion proteins across families of viruses provides a basis for selecting these as vaccine targets and for initial antigen designs. Having functional monoclonal antibodies to test antigens for authentic binding surfaces can guide the protein engineering needed to make immunogens. Recognition by B cells is facilitated when antigens are displayed in ordered arrays, and self-assembling nanoparticles provide a vehicle for presenting vaccine antigens in this way. The advent of gene-based expression of antigens from nucleic acids or vectors, advances in adjuvant formulations, and microneedle patches (bottom right) or needle-free or alternative inoculation devices can also contribute to the shortening of timelines and improved efficacy of new vaccines.

Also, in a crisis in which development timelines need to be compressed, using technologies that can provide a candidate vaccine that is based on information derived entirely from target-gene sequences will be more expeditious than procedures that require isolation and growth of a virus that might require high-level containment. This means that even for families of viruses for which there are licensed vaccines, additional approaches beyond liveattenuated and whole-inactivated vaccines should be explored. In parallel, conventional vaccine approaches could be developed as an alternative solution that might be needed in the long term.",

However, since 2009, new technologies have evolved that have provided the tools for reimagining an accelerated process of vaccine development 23 . Key technologies that have changed the pace of vaccine development include the rapid isolation of human monoclonal antibodies [24] [25] [26] , the ability to define atomic-level structures of viral surface proteins and how they are organized on viral particles 12,27-31 , next-generation sequencing to characterize both the virus and the repertoire of the host immune response 32 and methods for defining epitope-specific immune cell phenotypes with more precision at a single-cell level (Fig. 1) . Techniques for identifying human monoclonal antibodies by cloning genes encoding paired immunoglobulin heavy and light chains from sorted B cells has been particularly transformative. This method can help define antibody lineages associated with disease progression or immunity and provide precise endpoints for the evaluation of immunogenicity. In addition, monoclonal antibodies are critical reagents not only for assessing the antigenicity of new immunogen designs but also for development as clinical products for passive prophylaxis or therapy.",

While those outbreaks were alarming, there was no indication until 2014 that filoviruses are able to spread as a large epidemic through both urban centers and rural areas. After Ebola re-emerged in the 1995 Kikwit epidemic, work on filovirus pathogenesis, immunity and vaccine development was carried out by relatively few investigators because of the need for a biosafety level 4 containment space and limited commercial interest to support advanced development. That changed in 2001, when a greater emphasis was placed on biodefense research as a result of the anthrax attacks on postal facilities and government offices. The US government recognized a gap in preparedness for natural or intentional exposure to highly lethal pathogens, and Operation Bioshield was launched as a mechanism for funding research and development for countermeasures against a list of specific, highly lethal agents (category A pathogens). Research funding was complemented by new rules from the US FDA to facilitate the licensure of vaccines and therapeutics with animal data. Since the efficacy of vaccines directed against category A lethal pathogens cannot be evaluated easily in humans, the FDA Animal Rule (21 CFR 314.601.90) was proposed to provide a pathway for the regulatory review of biological countermeasures against such pathogens on the basis of efficacy studies in animals instead of humans, with the definition of immunological correlates of protection in well-defined animal models that recapitulate the pathogenesis of human disease, and bridging studies in humans for safety and immunogenicity. The increased support for identifying interventions for pathogens with potential for use in biowarfare and new regulatory options for clinical development led to the first phase I evaluation of a candidate vaccine against Ebola virus in 2003 (refs 52,53 ) . A series of subsequent clinical trials of both DNA and recombinant adenovirus vectored vaccines proceeded over the ensuing 10 years and included optimization of vaccine components and refinement of the surface-glycoprotein-antigen design. Extensive studies of vaccine efficacy and correlates of immunity guided the development of these vaccines [54] [55] [56] . In parallel, there were substantial advances in understanding the structure, entry mechanisms, replication strategies and pathogenesis of Ebola virus that informed the design of vaccines and clinical trials. Over the course of two decades, this basic research on pathogenesis and immunological correlates of protection, together with clinical evaluation of safety and immunogenicity in phase I trials, formed a critical safety database and foundation of knowledge that allowed the rapid entry of new candidate vaccines against Ebola virus into advanced clinical evaluation during the 2014 outbreak. For example, the final lead adenovirusbased vaccine candidate, ChAd3-EBO, entered phase I evaluation in September 2014, within 1 month of the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. With the cooperation and efforts of multiple government agencies, regulatory authorities and funders, a world-wide consortium of sites helped to expand the safety and immunogenicity database and allowed this product to enter efficacy evaluation in Liberia by February 2015 (refs 55, [57] [58] [59] ). The established safety data for Ebola virus glycoprotein antigens in humans also facilitated the rapid advance of other glycoproteinexpressing vaccine vectors that had not been tested in humans before, including recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV), which was successfully evaluated for efficacy in Guinea in 2015 (ref. 60 ). Despite the efforts for rapid deployment, the ChAd3 vector did not complete efficacy testing in Liberia because there were no more incident cases of Ebola. However, the rVSV vaccine was found to be efficacious in a stepped-wedge ring-vaccination design in Guinea, where the outbreak continued for a few more months. Achieving an efficacy result was possible not only because of prior basic and clinical research but also because the ChAd3-EBO vaccine and rVSV vaccine had been manufactured and vialed by current good manufacturing practice before the 2014 outbreak in West Africa from prior investments by the US government and Canadian government, respectively.",

Ideally, the vaccine would have already been licensed for general use on the basis of the Animal Rule or would have been pre-authorized for emergency use by regional regulatory authorities and stockpiled in sufficient quantities before the epidemic. Alternatively, unlicensed experimental vaccines prepared for use in humans by current good manufacturing practice could be stockpiled in sufficient quantities and clinical protocols and consent documents could be preapproved by regional regulatory agencies for expanded use. Therefore, if the clinical infrastructure were available, rapid deployment and evaluation of a vaccine could be accomplished. Since achieving licensure through traditional pathways by randomized clinical phase III efficacy trials is unlikely in the absence of ongoing and consistent Viruses of concern not included among the prototypic viruses in Table 2 endemic transmission, other provisions for licensure by the Animal Rule or pre-outbreak approvals for clinical efficacy testing during new outbreaks should be proactively established. Since its discovery in 1947 in the Ziika forest in Uganda, Zika virus was occasionally recognized as a cause of mild dengue-like syndrome with fever and rash 61 . In 2007, it caused an outbreak on Yap island, then in 2013, it emerged in French Polynesia, and the current regional outbreak started in late 2014 in Brazil. The cause of the outbreak was recognized to be Zika virus in May 2015, and the association with fetal infection and neurological disorders was identified in early 2016, when the WHO declared a global health emergency [62] [63] [64] .",

Although Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad, India, had recognized the potential need for a vaccine against Zika virus in 2013 during the French Polynesia outbreak, vaccine development was not accelerated until 2016, in parallel with a variety of platform technologies that advanced rapidly on the basis of the extensive information available from work on other members of the Flaviviridae family 65 . This included a substantial body of knowledge about viral structure 66, 67 and mechanisms of antibody neutralization [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] , as well as a precedent for successful vaccine development [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] . Vaccines based on nucleic-acid platform technology were available first [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] , but vector-based approaches and traditional platforms using whole-inactivated virus, live-attenuated virus or live chimeric viruses were not far behind and were developed in parallel [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] . Animal models were rapidly developed 91 , serological assays 92 and diagnostic tests were established 93 , monoclonal antibodies were isolated 24, 74, 94 , basic aspects of flavivirus-specific virology were confirmed, including atomic-level structures 28, 95 , and large natural-history and epidemiological studies were initiated. Within 7 months of the time of the announcement of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern, phase I clinical trials were initiated, and phase IIb efficacy evaluation of early candidates began within 18 months. Modeling transmission dynamics to anticipate where trial sites should be located, trying to capture the mosquito seasons in both the Southern hemisphere and Northern hemisphere and using infection as well as clinical symptom endpoints might increase the likelihood of achieving an efficacious result. As noted, moving into advanced clinical studies more rapidly would require pre-approved vaccine-delivery platforms and regional efficacy protocols in addition to maintenance of a global clinical trials infrastructure that could be accessed on short notice.",

Intermediate options could include the manufacture and evaluation of at least one product from each major technology platform through the stages of phase I and II clinical testing, rather than for each family or subgroup of viruses. For example, the steps involved in constructing and manufacturing a product using gene-based antigen delivery by nucleic acids or a replication-defective vector might be the same for any envelope glycoprotein that functions as a trimeric class I fusion 'machine' , regardless of the specific virus. Likewise, the steps involved in scaling up the production of a VLP for viruses with icosahedral capsids might be similar. Having a precedent for the manufacture of a particular type of product before the next crisis occurs would improve response time. However, to the extent possible, and because each virus, even within taxonomic families, has unique characteristics, developing rational candidate vaccines directed against at least one prototype virus within each major phenotypic category within each family of viruses is advisable (Table 2) . New partnership models to accomplish these tasks using both public funding and private funding might be needed; such models include government-to-government collaboration, nonprofit organizations, philanthropy and public-private partnerships. The experience with Ebola and Zika taught that as media coverage wanes and pressure from the public health crisis diminishes, political will and corporate commitment to long-term vaccine-development efforts can waver.",

Solving the biological challenges for these 'difficult' viral pathogens might provide solutions that could be used in pre-pandemic vaccine development or rapid vaccine development in response to emerging viral pathogens.
