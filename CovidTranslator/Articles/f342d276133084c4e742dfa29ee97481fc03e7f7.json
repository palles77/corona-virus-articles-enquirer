In vv-infected cells cytoplasmically synthesized vv core proteins became disulfide bonded in the newly assembled intracellular mature viruses (IMVs). vv membrane proteins also assembled disulfide bonds, but independent of IMV formation and to a large extent on their cytoplasmic domains. If disulfide bonding was prevented, virus assembly was only partially impaired as shown by electron microscopy as well as a biochemical assay of IMV formation. Under these con-ditions, however, the membranes around the isolated particles appeared less stable and detached from the underlying core. During the viral infection process the membrane proteins remained disulfide bonded, whereas the core proteins were reduced, concomitant with delivery of the cores into the cytoplasm. Our data show that vv has evolved an unique system for the assembly of cytoplasmic disulfide bonds that are localized both on the exterior and interior parts of the IMV.",

            "text": "T HE formation of disulfide bonds during (re)folding of proteins in vitro has been well documented (reviewed in 15). Most of the recent interest in protein folding, however, has concentrated on the folding and disulfide bond formation in (mammalian) cells. It is now well accepted that disulfide bonding and folding of proteins occur in the lumen of the ER. The unique (GSH/GSSG) 1 ratio (of \u202b\u0641\u202c 3:1) within the lumen of this compartment is thought to provide it with a redox potential that, in contrast to the cytosol (ratio 100:1), is oxidizing enough to favor disulfide bonding (24). Moreover, the ER lumen contains a variety of molecular chaperones that assist in the folding reactions (for review see 17, 19, 20) . Finally, this compartment is equipped with an abundant nonmembrane protein, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), that from in vitro experiments (3, 5) , as well as from genetic evidence (36), plays an important role in the disulfide bonding of proteins in the ER. PDI contains two, thioredoxinlike motifs, a sequence of 11 amino acids that aligns with a corresponding sequence in the Escherichia coli thiore-doxin protein (reviewed in 15, 16) . This latter protein may be involved in catalyzing reduction (21) . Other proteins that contain thioredoxin motifs include glutaredoxin (21), E. coli DsbA (the E. coli equivalent of PDI), and the ER proteins ERp72 and ERp60. These proteins contain the characteristic active site sequence composed of CXXC in which the cysteine residues act as redox-active groups (16). Viral membrane proteins have been used extensively to study the disulfide bonding and folding processes in the ER lumen (reviewed in 10). They appear to follow the same rules as cellular proteins in that they are inserted in a cotranslational manner into the ER where they undergo folding and oligomerization reactions. Moreover, they provide an advantage over cellular proteins in being abundantly expressed upon viral infection, thus facilitating detailed studies of these processes. Recent results using the well-characterized influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein, have shown that upon addition of DTT to living cells, newly synthesized HA remains reduced in the lumen of the ER while already synthesized and disulfide bonded molecules become reduced as long as they resided inside the ER (2). This observation has subsequently been tested with other proteins, mostly with similar results (for example see 37, 45, 56) .",

It contains a dsDNA genome of \u202b\u0641\u202c 190 kB encoding for \u03fe 200 proteins, of which \u202b\u0641\u202c 100 seem to be associated with the virion (14) . vv is unique in that during its life cycle two infectious forms are made, the intracellular mature virus (IMV) and the extracellular enveloped virus (EEV; 40). We have recently shown that the IMV membranes are derived from the intermediate compartment (IC) located between the ER and the Golgi complex (53), a finding that is consistent with the fact that at least three of its membrane proteins insert cotranslationally into the RER and are retained in the IC in infected cells (34, 51) . Although the detailed structure of the IMV is unknown, it is generally accepted that the virion is composed of a membraneenclosed, brick-shaped core that contains four particularly abundant proteins, 4a (gene A10L), 4b (A3L), and the 11-kD (F17R) and 25-kD (L4R) putative DNA-binding proteins (see Fig. 1 and Table I ). The surface of the viral core is studded with a spike-like structure, that comprises, at least in part, an abundant 39-kD protein (A4L; 8, 50). The IC-derived cisternal membranes that surround the core contain three highly abundant membrane proteins of 16 (A14L), 21 (A17L), and 8 (A13L) kD (26, 51), as well as a peripheral membrane protein p14 (A27L; 47, 49, 54). Furthermore the IMV membrane contains a set of less abundant membrane proteins such as p32 (D8L; 43), p35 (H3L; 4), and a 27-kD myristoylated protein (L1R; 60; see Fig. 1 and Table I ).",

            "text": "The IMV structure is highly dependent on disulfide bonds. It is well known that the removal of the viral membranes from the underlying core structure requires a mixture of a nonionic detergent and a reducing agent such as \u2424 -mercaptoethanol (12, 22, 52) . More recent evidence for the sensitivity of the viral structure to reducing agents comes from the work of Roos et al. (50) showing that treatment of intact IMV with DTT induces the enveloping cisternal membranes to peel off the underlying core, as assessed by a novel cryo-EM technique. At the biochemical level several studies have indeed shown that vv membrane proteins may be disulfide bonded. Thus, the two abundant membrane proteins p21 and p16 as well as p32 have been shown to form disulfide bonded dimers (38, 47, 49) . Since these latter proteins are associated with the IMV membrane, their disulfide bonding could logically be expected to occur in the lumen of the ER, following the accepted rules of disulfide bonding in vivo (see above). However, our recent detailed characterization of the topology of some of those proteins appeared to show that the cysteines potentially involved in disulfide bonding may be located in the cytoplasm (for example see 34, 51). Several studies have also suggested that cytoplasmically synthesized vv core proteins may form disulfide bonds. The work by Oie and Ichihashi (44) and Ichihashi et al. (25) described disulfide bonding of several proteins that were not further identified, but that from their characteristic migration in SDS-PAGE could be expected to be viral core proteins. These combined data seemed at odds with the current dogma on the intracellular formation of disulfide bonds. Until now we had rationalized by assuming that such cytoplasmic disulfide bonds were the result of after lysis oxidation, since in most of the relevant studies no alkylating reagent was used to prevent such (artifactual) disulfide bonding.",

Throughout this study we therefore used the alkylating reagent NEM before cell lysis. Disulfide bonding was analyzed under three different conditions of infection. First, IMV was isolated and purified using our standard protocols, except that the infected cells were treated with NEM (or iodoacetamide; data not shown) before lysis, in order to assess the disulfide bonding as it occurred in the (isolated) IMV. Second, cells were infected in the presence of rifampicin, a drug that reversibly blocks the IMV formation at an early assembly stage but does not interfere with the synthesis of late proteins (40); this allowed us to assess whether or not the disulfide bonding depended on IMV assembly. Finally, cell lysates were also prepared from infected cells that were not treated with rifampicin to study the vv proteins in the infected cells at all stages of assembly.",

The amount of dimer formation was somewhat variable; in the case of p21 and p16 \u202b\u0641\u202c 50% of the protein dimerized (see also below) while of p32 no more than 30% of the protein was in the dimer form. As noted before (48, 49, 55) , the dimers of both p16 and p21 migrated at molecular masses that were smaller than the sum of two monomers. We presume that this is a consequence of a folded conformation of the dimer and not due to heterodimerization. By two-dimensional (2-D) gel analysis we have shown before that the dimers of p21 and p16 run at the same pI as their respective monomers (26).

Indeed, in rifampicin treated cell lysates both proteins migrated at the position of their precursor form and the migration of both proteins was the same when analyzed with or without prior reduction. However, in the IMV the mature forms of these two proteins showed additional bands when analyzed without reduction. The protein 4a occurred both as a monomer of 65 kD, as well as a dimer of \u202b\u0641\u202c 130 kD when \u2424 -ME and DTT were omitted from the sample buffer ( Fig.  2 b) . That the dimer indeed ran at \u202b\u0641\u202c 130 kD can be better appreciated in Fig. 8 , where 4a was analyzed in a 10% SDS-PAGE (see below). After reduction 4a migrated predominantly in its (reduced) mature form of 65 kD, while the 130 kD band was clearly absent. Two additional bands were seen in this reduced sample, the upper one represents the uncleaved precursor, p4a (note the comigration of this band with the form made in rifampicin-blocked cell lysates), of which small amounts can be detected in mature virions, while the identity of the lower of the two remained open. When analyzing p25 in isolated virions under nonreducing conditions the protein showed a very unusual pattern and appeared as several (disulfide bonded) species some of which migrated as a smear rather than discrete bands (Fig. 2 b) .

If this topology is correct, p21 exposes two of its three cysteines (at positions 101 and 178) into the cytoplasm while its third cysteine (at position 131) is buried in the membrane (34).

That p16 may adopt two different topologies in infected cells was based on two independent pieces of evidence. First, using two different morphological assays we were able to show that a considerable fraction of p16 exposes the COOH terminus towards the cytosol (51). Second, since p16 is also partially N-glycosylated, its COOH terminus (that contains the N-glycosylation site) must also be exposed towards the lumen. A recently developed assay to quantitate the two different topologies of p16 in infected cells (Krijnse Locker and Griffiths, manuscript in preparation), showed that \u202b%05\u0641\u202c of the disulfide bonded dimer of p16 exposes its COOH terminus towards the cytoplasm, implying that disulfide bonding of this protein occurs, at least in part, on its cytoplasmic domain.",

Thus, the protein seems to belong to a recently described class of membrane proteins with COOH-terminal hydrophobic domains that insert posttranslationally, thereby exposing most of their NH 2 terminus towards the cytoplasm (35). If p32 inserts into the membrane accordingly, the protein would expose its single cysteine in the NH 2 terminus at position 262 towards the cytoplasm as well as on the outer surface of the IMV (see also 54). To test this possibility, we carried out two different set of experiments. First, purified IMV was treated with increasing concentrations of trypsin and the digestion of p32 was assayed by Western blot using an antibody recognizing amino acid 77 to 294 HeLa cells were pulse-labeled (0 min chase) for 2 min at 6 h after infection and chased for the indicated time.

After 60 min of chase the disulfide bonded dimer is detected as assessed by the absence of the 25-kD band when analyzed after reduction.

For this, advantage was taken of a previously described observation that the addition of 5 mM DTT to living cells not only keeps newly synthesized membrane proteins reduced but is also capable of reducing already oxidized proteins residing in the ER (2). 4 h after infection 5 mM DTT was added to one dish of cells, while a parallel dish was kept free of DTT. 4 h after infection was chosen since this time point is about one hour before the onset of viral assembly. At 8 h after infection the cells were fixed, embedded into Epon and the IMV-formation was assessed by EM. Since the DTT incubations were done over relatively long periods of time, the medium of the cells was replaced each hour with medium to which freshly prepared DTT was added just before use.",

However, upon closer examination a substantial fraction of IMVs could be detected that resembled virions in various stages of apparent disassembly (Fig. 6, b-f ). Profiles were seen of particles in which the membranes had become less rigid and detaching from the underlying core. Occasionally we also observed particles indistinguishable from viral Figure 5 . The NH 2 terminus of p32 is exposed on the IMV surface and towards the cytoplasm of infected cells. (A) Purified IMV was treated for 30 min at 30\u040aC with the indicated concentrations of trypsin. Digested IMV was pelleted by a 30-min centrifugation at 15,000 g. The pelleted virus (pellet) and the remaining supernatant were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blots using antibodies to p32, 4a, and p14. P14 and 4a were analyzed after reduction while p32 was analyzed under nonreducing conditions only. The position of the monomer of p32 is indicated with one and that of the dimer with two asterisks. (B) Post nuclear supernatants of rifampicin-treated cells infected with a vv recombinant expressing the MHV-M protein were prepared at 7 h after infection. PNS was treated with the indicated concentrations of trypsin at 30\u040aC for 30 min. Supernatant was separated from the membranes (pellet) by a centrifugation for 30 min at 150,000 g and both fractions were analyzed on 15% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were detected by Western blots using antibodies to p32, the NH 2 (M-N) or COOH terminus ( cores (not shown). Compared with the control cells, IVs and intermediates (53) appeared totally normal. None of these aberrant particles with detaching membranes or naked cores could be detected in the untreated control cells, implying that they resulted from the prolonged DTT incubation.",

Estimation of the cleavage of the precursor of a protein such as the core protein 4a using pulsechase experiments can thus be used as an indirect measure of the extent of IMV formation. To test the effect of DTT on IMV assembly using this assay, infected cells were left untreated or treated with DTT from 4 h after infection onwards. Subsequently, they were pulse labeled for 15 min at 6 h after infection, chased for 2 or 3 h and cell lysates were then processed for immunoprecipitation, using antibodies to 4a and its precursor. Again, during the course of this experiment the medium was replaced several times with medium containing freshly prepared DTT (see legend to Fig.  7) . As shown in Fig. 7 both in the presence and absence of DTT the precursor p4a of 110 kD was efficiently cleaved into its 65-kD mature form (4a) during the chase. Phos-phorImager analyses showed that, consistent with previously published results (41; Fig. 7) , after 2 h of chase 35% of 4a was cleaved in the absence and 40% in the presence of DTT, while these percentages amounted to 48 and 57%, respectively, after 3 h of chase (not shown). These same analyses also showed that the overall synthesis of 4a was reduced by \u202b%04\u0641\u202c in the presence of DTT, which is most likely the result of the long incubations with this drug. Importantly, however, 4a and p4a did not seem to undergo substantial degradation, suggesting that the newly formed cores were quite stable, both with and without DTT.",

In each case, when medium with DTT was applied to the cells, freshly prepared DTT was added to the medium just before use. At 5 h after infection the medium was replaced with medium with or without DTT. At 5.5 h after infection the cells were starved in methionine-free DMEM with or without DTT. Pulselabeling for 15 min (chase 0 h) was at 6 h after infection and consisted of replacing the methionine-free medium by the same medium containing 50 Ci of [ 35 S]methionine with or without DTT. After the pulse, cells were chased for 2 and 3 h (chase 2 and 3 h) in medium with or without DTT that was replaced each hour.

We decided therefore to isolate the virions from infected cells and to analyze the disulfide bonding of their proteins. For this, infected cells were left untreated or were treated with DTT from 4 until 9 h after infection and IMVs were isolated after extensive washing of the cells with PBS containing NEM to quench the DTT. Again during the 5-h DTT treatment the medium with DTT was replaced every hour with medium containing fresh DTT. After virus isolation the disulfide bonding of selected membrane and core proteins was analyzed by Western blots. DTT indeed had its expected effects on the vv proteins; the core proteins 4a, p25 as well as the membrane proteins p21 and p16 migrated in their reduced form only in particles isolated from DTT-treated cells (Fig. 8) . As expected, in the virions from control cells the same pattern of disulfide bonding was observed as described above (Fig. 8) . Since in this particular experiment we used 10% instead of 15% SDS-PAGE, the dimer of 4a was much better separated from its monomer. Again, small amounts of the precursor of 4a were present in this virus preparation and it is more evident in this analysis that the dimer of 4a is substantially larger than the 110-kD precursor form.",

In these experiments the cells were not quenched with NEM before virus isolation since treatment of the IMV with DTT in vitro, followed by NEM or iodoacetamide incubation, completely abolished infectivity (data not shown). The average of three independent experiments showed clearly that the IMV isolated from DTT-treated cells had a title that was 10-fold reduced relative to virus isolated from control cells (Table II) . We have shown before in several studies that when purified IMV is treated for 30 min at 37\u040aC with 20 mM DTT, the membranes separate in part from the core (see 8, 50, 54). Structurally, this in vitro DTT treatment is very similar to what we observed with the virions isolated from DTT-treated cells. We next asked therefore whether isolated IMV treated with DTT in vitro was still infectious. Remarkably, and in contrast to the virus from DTTtreated cells, IMV that had been treated in vitro with DTT Figure 8 .

In vv life cycle DNA replication starts from 2 h after infection onwards, while late protein synthesis commences at 5-6 h of infection. The characteristic pattern of immunofluorescence at 6 h after infection is the complete overlap of the sites where viral DNA and late proteins accumulate. HeLa cells grown on coverslips were therefore infected with different multiplicity of infections (MOIs) ranging from 5 to 20 (see Materials and Methods) and fixed at 6 h after infection. The extent of infection was assayed by double indirect immunofluorescence using an antibody to vv cores (see Materials and Methods) that recognizes newly synthesized core proteins, as well as Hoechst dye to label the viral DNA. As expected, the cytoplasm of all cells were labeled for both DNA as well as the anti-core antibody when using virus from untreated cells, even at the lowest multiplicity of infection (Table III) . Similarly, when this same virus preparation was treated with DTT in vitro all cells were infected at 6 h after infection (data not shown). However, when similar amounts of infectious units were used of virus from DTT-treated cells, even at the highest MOI the amount of cells showing DNA replication, as well as protein synthesis, was significantly reduced (Table III) . More specifically, we found that, compared with control virus, at an MOI of 5 the percentage of DNA-positive cells was reduced by 73% and late protein-expressing cells by 98%. Apparently, the infection cycle of these viruses was severely delayed.",

Highly purified IMV stocks were therefore bound to cells on ice and subsequently shifted to 37\u040aC for 1 h. Bound (but nonpenetrated) particles were removed by trypsin treatment on ice (see Materials and Methods). Subsequently, the infected cells were lysed and the vv proteins analyzed under reducing and nonreducing condition using Western blots. Under these conditions the two core proteins 4a and p25 migrated exclusively at the position of the reduced form (Fig. 10) . To our surprise, the membrane proteins p16 and p21 did not appear to become reduced during early times of infection. Instead both proteins migrated with a slightly higher molecular mass than their respective dimers seen under nonreducing conditions (Fig.  10) . When analyzed after reduction these forms of both p16 and p21 migrated slightly slower than their respective monomers (Fig. 10) . Since by 2-D gel analysis, these newly generated forms of p21 and p16 appeared to have the same pI as the proteins in isolated virions (not shown), we presume that this slower migration is due to a (unconventional) conformational change and not the consequence of their binding to some other (unknown) protein.",

These disulfide bonds occur in the newly assembled (intracellular) IMV particle since they are not formed in the presence of rifampicin which arrests the assembly of the IMV. This is further supported by the fact that the mature form of the core protein 4a, that is made concomitant with the assembly of the IMV (30, 31, 41), forms dimers while its cytosolic precursor, p4a does not. The model that emerges from these results is that after the vaccinia virus has sealed, it is able to provide an environment within the particle that promotes the assembly of disulfide bonds of the core proteins, an environment that is inaccessible to GSH/GSSG, the cytoplasmic redox buffer. Indeed, treatment in vitro of purified IMV with concentrations up to 10 mM GSH failed to reduce the core proteins as analyzed by Western blots (data not shown).",

In agreement with the data of Niles and Seto (43) we show that the disulfide bonded dimer, as well as the monomer of p32 is exposed on the surface of the IMV. This protein adopts a similar topology in infected cells in which the entire NH 2 terminus, including its single cysteine, of both the dimer and the monomer forms are located in the cytoplasm, since both were completely digested after protease treatment.

Moreover, we have noticed that the gene product of G4L also shares \u202b%05\u0641\u202c homology over a stretch of \u202b05\u0641\u202c amino acids (which includes the CXXC sequence) with yeast PDI. Preliminary data, however, have shown that neither of the two vv proteins is required for the disulfide bonding of vv proteins (data not shown).We also considered the possibility that the vv infection alters the cytoplasmic redox providing an environment that is more favorable for the assembly of cytoplasmic disulfide bonds.

In vitro studies have shown that the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds depends on the conformation, as well as on the inherent disulfide oxidation-reduction potential of the protein (for example see 7). Intracellular disulfide bonding is influenced by the cellular redox potential, that is the consequence mainly of the ratio of reduced and oxidized glutathione. The redox state of the cytoplasm does not generally favor disulfide bond formation. However, based on the in vitro studies the putative disulfide bonding of proteins under cytosolic (reducing) redox conditions can be rationalized by assuming that the redox potential of the membrane proteins themselves must be higher than the cytosolic redox (for example see 6) and that, in addition, the conformation/organization of the proteins in the virally modified IC membranes favors the intermolecular disulfide bonding and folding. Consistent with the first idea could be the fact that, as analyzed by Western blots, the viral membrane proteins are highly resistant to reduction and that quantitative reduction requires the addition of 5% \u2424-ME as well as high amounts of DTT (see also 49). This observation may also explain why cytosolic disulfide bonds of vv membrane proteins would naturally resist the (physiological) reducing environment of the cytosol.",

Apparently normal looking IMV particles that lack detectable disulfide bonds were seen in cells infected in the presence of DTT. These data imply that assembly per se is not dependent on disulfide bonding and must therefore rely on other types of protein interactions. However, the virions made in the presence of DTT were not completely assembled since they tended to loose their membranes in vivo and (more clearly) upon their isolation. Together with our recent data showing that treatment of purified virions with DTT opens up the viral membranes (which we argue are not fused into a continuous bilayer around the virus; see Fig.  1 ), these results clearly establish an important role of disulfide bonds in vv membrane proteins. Both the in vitro as well as the in vivo data show that in their absence the viral membranes are unable to remain tight around the particle and instead open up and detach from the underlying core. At present the reason why the three membrane proteins form homodimers as well as monomers is not clear. This phenomenon is obviously needed for the stability of the particle.",

An obvious idea that comes to mind is that disulfide bonding during assembly will generate a stable core, while reduction during entry makes it unstable and primes it for disassembly. However, some results are difficult to reconcile with this idea. For instance, in DTT treated cells the cores are reduced but do not seem to fall apart. Also, cores resist prolonged treatment of IMVs with DTT in vitro (unpublished observations) and DTT-treated IMVs retain full infectivity. And finally, it is known that when uncoating of the cores after entry in prevented, the cores may persist for hours in the cytoplasm (for example see 27). When the IMV infects cells a viral core particle indistinguishable from those produced by treating IMVs with NP-40 and DTT (23) appears in the cytoplasm. Within minutes this core starts to make a defined set of socalled early mRNAs, a process that has been extensively studied in vitro using NP-40/DTT-treated virions. From such studies it is clear that, in vitro, this process of early transcription requires a reducing environment (42). Although it is very likely that the process of transcription itself requires reducing conditions, we would like to propose that the reduction of the core may play a role as well. Such a role can for example consist of a conformational change of the core structure that is required to activate the transcription machinery (that is contained in the core; 40). Alternatively, such a structural change could (also) be needed to allow the newly synthesized mRNA to exit the core, a process that has been shown to occur in vitro (29). Since the questions of changes that accompany transcription in vitro or the overall process in vivo have never been seriously addressed, a testing of our proposed scenario would require further advances in our understanding if these aspects of vaccinia virus life cycle.",
