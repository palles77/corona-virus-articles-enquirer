This case study introduces a conceptual framework that draws from theoretical change models but is also grounded in the reality of the change environment at this organization. Realizing major organizational change is a complex process influenced by the characteristics of an organization, the integrated project and change management framework, and the importance of key leadership roles throughout the change process.

On a daily basis organizations are challenged to improve their business performance, and take on new and exciting projects, often as a result of a change in strategy or to increase business effectiveness. With change becoming an increasingly important part of what leaders do, current organizational change literature is suggesting that senior management commitment is critical to the success of organizational change efforts (Herold and Fedor, 2008; Herzig and Jimmieson, 2006; Karp and Helgo, 2008; Raes et al., 2007) .",

This theoretical framework provides structure to this review (Merriam, 2001) and illustrates the terminology, concepts, and theories derived from the literature. This paper will also introduce a conceptual framework that draws common elements from theoretical change models, project management methodology, and is also grounded in the reality of the environment at this organization. To address the research question, how can significant project transformations be effectively managed by leaders during the change process? The researcher began with understanding the general linkage between project management and change management using the Cornerstone Program as a case at hand. This involved analyzing the integration of change management and project management models and discussing the key leadership roles during the change process.

This organization has not been without change since the late nineties. In 1998, the Ontario Government passed legislation that would govern the province's electricity industry, and Ontario Hydro (the predecessor company to Hydro One) was dismantled and Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One were created. All of that changed mid 2002 when the provincial government announced an action plan to not proceed with its 1998 direction to privatize the industry. Since that time a number of significant events affecting the stability of the organization occurred and there was a need to manage these unexpected events as well as maintain a focus on performing and improving the core operations of the business. These events included: the business response to September 11, 2001; government redirection of Hydro One and the Electricity Industry in Ontario in 2002; a new Corporate Strategic Plan implementation; key senior leadership turnover and transition; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003; the August 14 Blackout in 2003; a labour dispute in 2005; business changes affecting the environment and culture at major work centres; and challenges associated with updating and enhancing facility technology, practices and processes.",

The customers they are so proud to serve want more information, more service and better quality service. Processes and systems must be capable of responding. The accomplished work program is ramping up exponentially; however, it is a challenge to find the skilled resources in the market. They face greater industry demands from customers, regulators and the public. Internal pressures include a large portion of the workforce that is eligible for retirement; a geographically dispersed workforce; and, inconsistent system and business processes, all increasing the risks and costs associated with performing effective, efficient and compliant business operations. With the business environment changing, the organization is now focusing on renewing Ontario's Power Grid, accelerating changes in emerging technologies, creating higher expectations for quality, value and service, and providing opportunities for innovation, collaboration and leadership. All of these demands translate into Hydro One's need to do more with less, to do things differently. And to do this means changing and creating a vision for the company to establish a high performing organization that leverages leading business practices, leading software and technology solutions, and generating breakthroughs in human performance to address past, present and future demands.",

Cornerstone Phase 2 continued the expansion of Hydro One's SAP solution and brought a greater proportion of Hydro One's core business systems under the same system support. The Phase 2 in-service date was August 5, 2009. The entire Cornerstone program was designed to: support the corporate mission; foster adaptation to changing conditions; create more effective and efficient business operations; enable achievement of corporate objectives; and drive employee engagement.

The organizational change literature is extensive with models recommending various steps or phases for management and change agents to follow when initiating and implementing change (Huy, 2001; Van De Ven and Poole, 1995) . Former models of change (Galpin, 1996; Kotter, 1996; Nadler and Tushman, 1997) consist of multiple phases, however, in their discussion of change management strategies and the roles that leaders play, they discuss change as if it is a discrete event, a series of steps or stages or an easily prescribed process.",

There is a long-standing distinction in the change literature between descriptions of change; first-order change or incremental change, second-order or transformational change, and third-order or learning organizational change. The distinction is usually explained in terms of whether or not change is required to realize organizational performance outcomes, where first-order change does not challenge or contradict the established context of organization. Gareis (Gareis, 2009 ) defines second-order change as multi-dimensional, multi-level, deeper and more challenging for the organization. The changes intentionally challenge widely shared assumptions, and, in general, reframe the organizational system. This change often causes widespread anxiety, confusion, business disruption, as well as temporary productivity loss. First-order change focuses on the premise that the individual, group and organization will continuously learn at a system level, and that the organization learning will enable the organization and its members to continuously adapt to external and internal change. The focus of this paper is of a second-order change. Transformation efforts are creating a foundation to support the challenges to the existing culture, mission and organizational model (Bartunek and Moch, 1987) , and where an integration of its change dimensions (Gareis, 2009 ) are contributing towards its success.",

To be effective at leading these changes, organizations need to design flexible change management efforts, based on the unique characteristics of the change, and possess the leadership competencies for leading change (Herold and Fedor, 2008; Karp and Helgo, 2008) . Successful transformations can be linked to the forces that shape an organization's culture and its performance success. To the leaders who inspire, implement creative approaches and work toward shaping a vibrant, proud culture, there appears to be strong evidence that implementing a systematic approach to change (Appelbaum et al., 2008; Griffith-Cooper and King, 2007) , greater accountability through expectations, building competencies for taking responsibility for change (Bass, 1990; Hollander, 1978; Rost, 1993) , and creating open dialogue (Barrett et al., 1995) all contribute to creating the right climate for facilitating and sustaining change.",

Griffith-Cooper and King (Griffith-Cooper and King, 2007) suggests the connection between project management and change management is simply that most projects cause change and in order for the project to be successful the changes caused by the project need to be proactively managed (Harrington et al., 2002) to minimize the impact. The organizations that are doing this are also looking at their business less as operation based, and more as a series of projects to challenge and improve every aspect of what they do. This shift helps us to understand, limit, and better control the changes that are occurring. It also allows us to use a more thoughtful approach to the business, technical, and organizational issues that such changes create. Organizations that are carrying out projects are increasingly focusing on effective leadership as important success criteria (Legris and Collerette, 2006) , assessing the capabilities of executive sponsors (Crawford, 2003) and project leaders in resolving extraordinary situations and challenges with today's complex change (Griffith-Cooper and King, 2007) . Kloppenborg and Opfer's (2000) substantial literature review from the 1960s to 1990s provided insight into the project management movement and into the human resource and cultural issues as critical success factors for managing change initiated projects.",

Dannemiller and Jacobs (Dannemiller and Jacobs, 1992) furthered work in the area of large-scale change to addressing the influence of the growth of technology in business. French and Bell's (1978) definition of organizational change focused on the target of the change and specific intervention. Their focus was on strategic issues and the way in which the conceptual, strategic and practical levels of the organization system fit together. Porras and Robertson (1987) developed an organizational development theory that helped explain the ongoing tension between the theory of change and the practice of changing. Their contribution of implementation theory focuses on the intervention activities needed to execute effective planned change.",

This contributed towards a movement in influencing the culture change and only through managers emphasizing effective communications did it create engaged employees. Effective communication means not just telling people what you want them to do or what you do; it is about genuine two way dialogue with employees and is also depicted in this conceptual framework. Fig. 3 outlines the different functions and activities that were included as specific elements of the change process that were felt to impact the success of the Change Management Strategy. Whatever the end goal or measures of success, it could not be achieved until each of these elements were addressed. The interdependencies were managed through integration with the project implementation and leadership actions that were integral to the successful management of these interdependencies.

The readiness level of key stakeholders (those directly affected by the change or those who have influence over others) must be assessed, including: how they perceive the benefits from the change, their dissatisfaction with the existing situation, how they perceive the effort required to make the change, how they perceive the challenges associated with the change. This assessment influences the strategies and plans that need to be followed in dealing with key stakeholders. The strategy addresses the fundamental \"how\" in achieving the desired future, given the readiness levels of key stakeholders. (For example, in the face of strong support for the change, the strategy may be to drive it forward in a short period of time, with a minimum of engagement). In the face of strong resistance however, the organizational change approach may involve a higher degree of engagement over a longer timeframe. The plan to get to the desired future details the results to be achieved, actions to be taken to get there, accountability for those actions, a time frame for completion and measures to assess progress. Implementation is the movement forward with the strategy and plan with a strong focus on measurement of both the processes and results, and a willingness to consider revisions to the plan in the face of unforeseen events. Sustainment establishes processes and ownership of those processes to ensure against slippage of the alignment that has been achieved and its results, so that they become an ongoing part of the organization. Lessons Learned identifies what is working and not working in bringing about change. Managing this change and the transformation of the business can prove difficult without an easily understood, structured approach. Lessons Learned is the final step in Hydro One's structured approach to project and change management and a major deliverable from an overall project management perspective. This step in the project closure process provided an opportunity for people involved in the planning and implementation of similar projects to reflect on what went well and what could have gone better in managing the project and change impacts. The primary purpose of these Lessons Learned was to provide future project teams and their team leads with ideas and suggestions, for their consideration, for planning and executing their projects. Through small group meetings and one on one interviews, project team members provided their perspectives on one or more topics. These themes were then tabled in various workshops with senior project staff where they were discussed in detail and recommendations identified.",

The organization expects the eventual outcome of such change to be a transformation or renewed organization. As the organization continues to improve the business they will draw on the extensive experience and deep knowledge of long-term employees to provide innovative ideas and drive them to fruition. All the while, those most critical employees will be retiring at record rates. The work force presents a major challenge in the company's ability to orchestrate innovation, and needs to be addressed through a combination of the broad based involvement of our employees in designing and implementing the changes going on now within the organization. There is every reason to believe the organization has the cultural foundation to support what they are working to achieve, where everyone is making a contribution to not just their own job but to the entire business.",

The complexity in leading significant organizational change initiatives requires a comprehensive change framework that views change as a complex, often unpredictable task, as supported by the combined paradigms of Gareis (2009) , Shenhar and Dvir (2007) and Griffith-Cooper and King (2007) . This is clearly supported and reflected in the Integrated Change Framework. Change leadership behaviours and insights were instrumental in carefully choosing a change path and an implementation process that was adaptive and an organizational fit rather than disruptive. 2. Business transformation implies radical change with the aim of developing new and different ways of working (Herold and Fedor, 2008) . Transformational change requires strong leadership for a project to succeed, and a collaborative process initiated with staff from all parts of the business, members of the senior leadership team, all contributing to project success (Crawford et al., 2008 ). An increased focus on sponsorship and corporate governance provided the guidance, decision making and accountabilities required for successful project implementation while balancing and coordinating the overall needs of the organization.",
