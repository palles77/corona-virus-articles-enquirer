So far, their Pathology (1995), 27, January In studies that assigned Candida a pathogenic role in diarrhea, direct microscopic examination which showed yeast cells and/or mycelial forms in large number has been described as the most precise indicator of its presence in the role of a pathogen. 14 We performed an approximate quantitative assessment using a Gram stained smear and found that counts of over 25 cells per high power field were rarely seen in non-diarrheal stools. In contrast, 9% of diarrheal stools from children and 22070 from adults had counts of over 25 cells per field. In 6% of specimens from children and 19% of specimens from adults no other diarrheal pathogen was detected, suggestive that yeasts were etiologically associated with the episode of diarrhea. The yeasts most frequently isolated were C. albicans (53 per cent), T. glabrata (11.6%) and C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis (9.3% each). From the information we had on patients it was not possible to decipher which patients had community or hospital acquired diarrhea. Candida diarrhea following tetracycline, clindamycin and ampicillin therapy has been described. 12 So have its clinical features, especially its protracted course 12 . 14 and the dramatic response to nystatin. 12 However, certain features of yeastassociated diarrhea needs clearer definition ego their role in community versus hospital acquired diarrhea, in the healthy versus the compromized and following broadspectrum antibiotics. It is also not clear if it would be beneficial to treat such diarrhea or if it is self limiting. Salmonella associated diarrhea has been consistently high in Singapore, especially among children, and Campylobacter species-associated diarrhea consistently IOW. 15 ,18 In the present study 19070 of children and 6.4% of adults had Salmonella infection implying that it causes more serious disease in children than adults. Between 1988 and 1990 a sharp increase in isolation of non-typhoid salmonellas was recorded in Singapore. 17 A similar increase in Salmonella diarrhea in the USA was linked to the mass production of eggs. 18 ,19 Although many of the food sources of C. jejuni and Salmonella species are similar,21 to our knowledge there are no reports of eggs being a source of Campylobacter infection. Milk and water are unlikely sources of both pathogens in Singapore. Undercooked chicken, pork and sea-food may be common sources for both bacterial species, considering that quick stir fry dishes and steam boat meals are popular items in Singaporean cuisine. Perhaps one explanation for the higher isolation rate of Salmonella than Campylobacter species in Singapore may be that massproduced eggs are a major source of Salmonella species. This is mere speculation but worth testing out considering the number of children who require hospitalization for Salmonella diarrhea. Once a point source infection occurs, Salmonella can spread from person to person. 22 In this respect, asymptomatic adults may be important sources of infection to children.",

The choice of latex agglutination for routine testing rather than a more specific but also more labour intensive Enzyme immunoassay was made on considerations of available technician time and speed of delivering results. The duration of the present study was not sufficiently long to comment on the true incidence of rotavirus infection or its seasonality. As in the study quoted above 9 adenovirus HOSPITAL STUDY OF DJARRHEA IN SINGAPORE 51 was detected in about 3 % of diarrheal stools of children by EM, confirming that in Singapore it is an important cause of childhood diarrhea. It should be possible to determine its true incidence by using a more sensitive method than EM.",
