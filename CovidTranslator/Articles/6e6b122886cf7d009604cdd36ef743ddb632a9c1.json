The assay, based on multiple primer and probe sets located in different regions of the SARS-CoV genome, could discriminate SARS-CoV from other human and animal coronaviruses with a potential detection limit of <10 genomic copies per reaction. The real-time RT-PCR assay was more sensitive than a conventional RT-PCR assay or culture isolation and proved suitable to detect SARS-CoV in clinical specimens. Application of this assay will aid in diagnosing SARS-CoV infection. a RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; F, forward primer; R, reverse primer; P, probe. b Location based on the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus, Urbani strain (GenBank accession no.

Designated \"severe acute respiratory syndrome\" (SARS), the etiologic agent was later identified as a hitherto unrecognized coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (5, 6) . A diagnosis of SARS is based primarily on clinical and epidemiologic criteria, but many respiratory viruses can cause similar symptoms, and therefore rapid, reliable diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV infection were needed. In response to this need, three types of diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV were quickly developed: tissue culture isolation, antibody detection, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays.",

Amplification was carried out in 96well plates on an iCycler iQ Real-Time Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Thermocycling conditions consisted of 30 min at 48\u00b0C for reverse transcription, 10 min at 95\u00b0C for activation of the AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase, and 45 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C and 1 min at 60\u00b0C. Each run included one SARS-CoV genomic template control and at least two no-template controls for the extraction (to check for contamination during sample processing) and one no-template control for the PCR-amplification step. As a control for PCR inhibitors, and to monitor nucleic acid extraction efficiency, each sample was tested by real-time RT-PCR for the presence of the human ribonuclease (RNase) P gene (GenBank accesssion number NM_ 006413) by using the following primers and probe: forward primer 5\u2032-AGATTTGGACCTGCGAGCG-3\u2032; reverse primer 5\u2032-GAGCGGCTGTCTCCACAAGT-3\u2032; probe 5\u2032-TTCTGACCTGAAGGCTCTGCGCG-3\u2032. The assay reaction was performed identically to that described above except that primer concentrations used were 30 \u00b5M each. Fluorescence measurements were taken and the threshold cycle (C T ) value for each sample was calculated by determining the point at which fluorescence exceeded a threshold limit set at the mean plus 10 standard deviations above the baseline. A test result was considered positive if two or more of the SARS genomic targets showed positive results (C T <45 cycles) and all positive and negative control reactions gave expected values. Clinical specimens submitted to CDC for SARS-CoV testing that gave positive results were confirmed with a TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay based on three different primer and probe sets (Table 1 ). This assay was performed independently in a separate laboratory using newly extracted nucleic acid from a second specimen aliquot. The confirmatory assay used the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) and the Mx4000 Multiplex Quantitative PCR system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).",

Exogenous nucleic acid had no discernible effect on amplification efficiency of the SARS1 and SARS3 primer/probe sets, as demonstrated by the similarity in linear regression slopes and endpoint detection limits in the presence and absence of specimen extract (Table 3 ). In contrast, the standard curve for SARS2 had a more efficient slope (-3.21) in water than in the presence of spiked extract (-3.48) and with greater variation in the C T values at 20 target copies or lower, suggesting that the amplification reaction was less efficient in the presence of the specimen extract.

The increased sensitivity of the real-time RT-PCR assay over cell culture and conventional RT-PCR methods may aid detection of the virus at earlier stages of infection, when the virus is present at low titer in respiratory secretions (8) .

            "text": "Although real-time RT-PCR offers clear advantages over more conventional RT-PCR formats, assay results must still be interpreted with caution. For example, the effectiveness of RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV in clinical specimens has been shown to be greatly influenced by the quantity, type, and timing of specimen collection (8, 17) . False-negative results due to poor quality nucleic acid or presence of RT-PCR inhibitors can also be a concern. We addressed this by simultaneously testing for the human RNase P gene, which should be present in all adequately collected samples. False-negative results could also potentially arise from mutations occurring in the primer and probe target regions in the SARS-CoV genome. We addressed this by including multiple genetic targets in our assay and by carefully comparing our primer and probe sequences against published sequences of SARS-CoV as they became available. To avoid falsepositive results, meticulous care was taken to prevent introduction of contaminating viral RNA or previously amplified DNA during preparation of the nucleic acid extracts and amplification reactions. In addition, all RT-PCR-positive specimens were retested from a second, unopened sample aliquot and confirmed in a second laboratory by using a real-time assay based on different genetic targets. Slope determined from the formula: Y = Y intercept -slope log10. Slopes calculated for SARS1 (7.5 x 10 6 to 7.5 x 10 1 ); SARS2 (2 x 10 6 to 2 x 10 1 ); SARS3 (2 x 10 6 to 2 x 10 0 ). In conclusion, our real-time RT-PCR assay permitted rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of SARS-CoV in clinical specimens and provided needed diagnostic support during the recent SARS outbreak. Widely deploying this assay through the LRN will enhance our ability to provide a rapid response in the event of the possible return of SARS.
