This vaccine is comprised of a recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein and formulated on alum, together with a synthetic glucopyranosyl lipid A. The vaccine would induce neutralizing antibodies without causing Th2type immunopathology. Vaccine development is being led by the nonprofit product development partnership; Sabin Vaccine Institute and Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development in collaboration with two academic partners (the New York Blood Center and University of Texas Medical Branch); an industrial partner (Immune Design Corporation); and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. A roadmap for the product development of the RBD-S SARS vaccine is outlined with a goal to manufacture the vaccine for clinical testing within the next 5 years.",

Vaccines to protect high-risk groups, including the elderly, healthcare workers and laboratory personnel are particularly critical [2] . Several recent reviews have been published on the development of SARS vaccines, including those targeting the SARS-CoV S protein [1] [2] [3] . Here, the authors provide a rationale for developing a vaccine based on eliciting neutralizing antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein (RBD-S) [4] and building on this concept the authors provide a roadmap for the development and manufacture of a prototype RBD-S SARS vaccine. Our roadmap includes using the peer-reviewed literature to invite the scientific community to follow the progress of the development of a new vaccine through the activities of a nonprofit product development partnership (PDP).",

The full-length SARS-CoV S protein belongs to the class I of viral fusion proteins, which also includes the glycoprotein gp160 of HIV and hemagglutinin of influenza virus [5, 6] . The S protein fragment spanning the 193-mer polypeptide is the minimal RBD responsible for virus binding to the host-cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [4, 7] . RBD-S, which contains multiple conformation-dependent epitopes, induces strong neutralizing antibody responses, CD8 + T-cell responses and long-term protective immunity in animal models, as well as potent cross-neutralizing antibodies against pseudoviruses expressing S proteins of 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 human SARS-CoV strains, and an isolate from a civet zoonotic host [8] [9] [10] [11] . Moreover, more than 50% of the neutralizing activity in the sera of convalescent SARS patients is mediated by RBD-S-specific antibodies [9, 12] , while RBD-S can absorb and remove the majority of neutralizing antibodies in the antisera of rabbits, mice and monkeys immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV or modified vaccinia virus expressing S protein [9, 13] . These studies provide the rationale for selecting RBD-S as an important target for vaccine development. The recombinant 21 kDa RBD-S will be expressed in yeast (Pichia pastoris), bacteria (Escherichia coli), or baculovirus (pending studies demonstrating optimal protection, as described below). More recently, a second RBD-S 219-mer construct corresponding to residues 318-536 was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells and shown to exhibit correct folding and conformation followed by equivalent or enhanced protection [14] ; this construct will also be evaluated as a back-up vaccination strategy.",

Among the concerns regarding these vaccines is the possibility of vaccine enhancement of disease, which has been noted with feline CoVs causing feline infectious peritonitis [1, 19, 20] . Similarly, laboratory animals administered alum-adjuvanted whole-virus SARS-CoV vaccine and subsequently challenged with infectious virus experienced enhanced disease and immunopathology comprised of eosiniophilic infiltration and Th2-mediated inflammatory alveolar damage [21] , similar to immunopathologic lung reactions found in infants and animals challenged with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [22, 23] . A double-inactivated SARS-CoV (formalin and ultraviolet radiation) was also shown to elicit eosinophilic and immunoenhancing pathology, as well as poor protection, especially in aged animals, suggesting the possibility that aged humans (a desired target population for the vaccine) may be particularly vulnerable to vaccine-induced effects [24] . Further studies showed that a Venezuelan equine encephalitis vector containing the SARS nucleocapsid (NP) gene also elicited eosinophilic immunopathology in BALB/c mice after challenge without any noticeable protection [25] . Thus, it was hypothesized that the NP antigen of SARS-CoV may be responsible for this property of inactivated vaccines [25, 26] . It was also reported that the formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine was associated with lack of antibody affinity maturation followed by poor TLR stimulation, suggesting that NP may not account entirely for immune enhancement [27] .",

By performing a minimum of three full pilot runs with quality control for both process and release, the authors will maximize the probability of successful technology transfer for the cGMP manufacture and with optimal yield and purity. Accelerated and long-term stability studies will be conducted on the final formulations, with chemical stability emphasizing provocative tests at high pH to induce deamidation and with selective oxidizing agents to produce oxidation. In addition, stability will be assessed at different time points after conducting temperature incursion experiments (repeated freeze-thaw cycles and storage at different temperatures). Following completion of process development of the vaccine, the production technology will be transferred to WRAIR for cGMP manufacture. The final product will be subjected to a rigorous battery of assays for lot and product release at Sabin-TCH, WRAIR and other contractors ( Table 2) . Following GLP toxicology testing, a regulatory filing for clinical testing will be submitted to the US FDA.",

These intensive studies determined that when delivered as an injectable vaccine, inactivated SARS-CoV can elicit protective neutralizing antibodies. However, such vaccines also caused a Th2-derived immunoenhancing pathology bearing resemblance to the immunopathology that derailed efforts to produce an inactivated RSV vaccine more than four decades ago. Subsequent efforts determined that protective neutralizing antibodies were directed primarily against S protein responsible for receptor-binding, but even vaccines comprised of the full-length S protein can elicit immunopathology, albeit in reduced amounts. Therefore, efforts have, instead, focused on a subunit vaccine comprised of only the 193-mer RBD-S, the essential component responsible for receptor binding. In laboratory animals, recombinant RBD-S subunit vaccines elicited protection comparable with the S protein-based vaccines, but with minimal immune enhancement of immunopathology. A prototype recombinant RBD-S SARS vaccine formulated on alum, together with GLA at point of injection, is under development by the activities of a nonprofit PDP in collaboration with key academic, industrial and military partners.",

This assay also serves as a purity assay for RBD-S protein RP-HPLC (bulk protein) release, stabilityColumn and condition screening of a variety of RP-HPLC columns (including silica-and polymer-based) has been initiated to provide an assay that can better resolve full-length RBD-S protein from its productderived cleaved forms (i.e., <1 kDa difference)Multi-angle light scattering (bulk protein), information only A multi-angle light scattering detector utilized both online (with SE-HPLC) and offline (batch) has provided valuable data regarding the aggregation and native state of candidate antigens in solution. This assay could be used to detect polydispersity of RBD-S protein and assist in development of a stable formulation SDS-PAGE (bulk protein and formulation) in-process, release, stability SDS-PAGE assays under both nonreduced and reducing conditions allow determination of molecular weight, aggregation and purity of samples. A calibrated scanning densitometer allows a relatively quantitative aspect to the assay, involving the determination of limit of detection and linear range of the assay to assess purity and relative quantity. This assay is already adapted and implemented routinely for RBD-S protein analysis N-terminal sequencing (bulk protein), information only N-terminal sequencing has been completed on major, minor and contaminant bands to identify whether contaminants are product derived and cleavage sites. SDS-PAGE is completed, then transferred to a PVDF membrane and sent to a contracted service, audited by Sabin's Quality Assurance team and subject to a quality agreementMass spectrometry (bulk protein), information only ESMS is carried out on a Micromass Q-Tof mass spectrometer on samples to monitor mass and any posttranslational modifications. This assay will be used for RBD-S protein OPA (formulation) release, stabilityThe OPA assay measures protein content by fluorescent detection of primary amines using OPA, a highly sensitive amine-reacting reagent. This technique is especially applicable to vaccine formulations with Alhydrogel \u00ae (Brenntag Biosector, Frederikssund, Denmark) where protein content cannot be measured by absorbance at 280 nm and measurement of the percentage of Alhydrogel-bound protein and Alhydrogelunbound protein is desired. This assay will be adapted to RBD-S protein and its formulation buffers and has been widely used to determine Alhydrogel protein binding efficiency thus far HCP content in-process, release Residual HCP impurities in in-process fermentation and purification products and final purified protein samples are evaluated using a slot blot system with a scanning calibrated densitometer with a picogram level of sensitivity Potency, ELISA (formulation) release and stability to be determined.
