            "text": "Sialodacryoadenitis (SDA) is a naturally-occurring infection of the laboratory rat raused by the coronavirus, sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV). The study of SDAV has been limited because there is no widely available continuous cell line for the propagation of high titers of the virus. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to compare the ability of SDAV to replicate in the permanent cell lines, LBC, of rat origin, and the mouse cell lines. L-929 and L-2. Following 2 to 6 repeated passages of SDAV in LBC cells, the virus could be readily propagated in LBC and L-2 cells, but not in L-929 cells. Similarly, SDAV adapted to replicate directly in L-2 cells could be readily propagated in LBC, but not L-929 cells. In LBC and L-2 cells, cytopathic effect (CPE), viral antigen, viral particles, and virus infectivity could be demonstrated. Titers of up to 108.o infectious viral particles/0.25 ml of culture fluid were obtained at 48 hours in L-2 cells. Titers in LBC cells were one to two logs lower. When susceptible rats were inoculated with eighth passage L-2 cell-adapted virus, they developed typical lesions of SDA. Virus could be recovered from infected tissues and propagated in L-2 cells on first passage. The ability to propagate SDAV to high titers in the widely available L-2 cell line should promote the study of this virus and facilitate its comparison with other murine coronaviruses.",

            "text": "Sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) infection is widespread in the laboratory rat. Based on reported serological surveys, the incidence of this coronavirus in rat colonies may be as high as 75% [15, 17] . Lesions associated with SDAV infection include sialoadenitis, dacryoadenitis, rhinitis [1, 13, 14, t9] , reproductive disorders [7] , and tracheobronchitis [25] . SDAV may also accelerate the progression of murine respiratory mycoplasmosis [23] , and through damage to submandibular salivary glands, may cause depletion of epidermal growth factor [21] . Although the course of the disease is generally short, with rapid recovery [ 1 ] , SDA can cause a variety of complications which may affect the results of behavioral, eye, reproductive, cancer and respiratory research [-5, 7, 21, 25] . In an early study by Bhatt et al. [2] , a variety of continuous cell fines including BHK-21, VERO, and Hep-2 cells were evaluated for their ability to support the replication of SDAV. A variety of primary monolayer cultures including primary rat kidney cells (PRK) were also tested. Bhatt et al. [2] also tried propagating SDAV in explant cultures of rat submaxillary (submandibular), parotid, Harderian and exorbital glands; and in trypsin-dispersed mouse brain cell cultures. Replication and cytopathic effect (CPE) were observed only in PRK cells. Maximum titers of 102.7 TCID50 were obtained PRK cells at 36 hours post-inoculation (pi) with strain #681 of SDAV [2] . All attempts to isolate virus from tissue culture systems other than PRK cells were negative. However, they found that SDAV could be propagated by intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice, and recorded titers of up to 105.3 TCIDs0 in PRK cells [2] .",

            "text": "Recently Hirano et al. [11] reported the ability of rat coronaviruses to replicate in the LBC continuous cell line derived from a mammary tumor in a Lewis rat. In LBC cells inoculated with strain #681 of SDAV, CPE was first detected in infected cultures 48 hours pi, and syncytia were observed by 72 hours pi [11] . By the sixth passage of SDAV in LBC cells, CPE was extensive by 24 hours. Viral antigen and TCIDs0 titers of 107/0.2ml could be detected in inoculated culture fluid at 24 hours pi by the tenth passage of SDAV in LBC cells [11] . The work by Hirano et al. [9--11] with the LBC cells thus confirmed that it was possible to propagate rat coronaviruses in a continuous cell line. LBC cells are not, however, widely available and they are relatively slow growing. Thus, we attempted to find another permanent cell line which would support the production of high titers of SDAV. In this report we compare the titers and the in vivo and in vitro infectivity of SDAV grown in LBC cells, L-2 cells, and in L-929 cells.",

Viral antigen was evident in the cytoplasm of infected single and syncytial giant cells stained for immunofluorescence microscopy ( Fig. 2A) . We also attempted to infect L-2 cells directly with purified #681 stock virus and with SDAV-infected salivary gland material. In repeated experiments, 2 to 6 serial passages were required before virus could be detected by the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) technique at 48-72 hours pi. Once SDAV was adapted to replicate in L-2 cells, viral antigen could be detected by immunofluorescence microscopy at 24-48 hours pi in the cytoplasm of individual cells, and in syncytial giant cells (Fig. 2B) . Uninoculated monolayers were consistently negative for viral antigen and CPE throughout the study. Viral particles were also demonstrated in SDAV-infected L-2 cells by electron microscopy. In infected cells, reduced electron density, duplication of endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasmic vacuolation, and fragmentation of cells were observed. Typical coronaviral particles 60 to 130nm in diameter were demonstrated within cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 3) . ",

Until recently, the study and characterization of SDAV was hampered by the absence of a continuous cell line capable of supporting the replication of high titers of the virus. The report by Hirana et al. of the ability of SDAV to grow in LBC cells was an important advancement [11] . Maru and Sato [18] isolated a strain of coronavirus from the submandibular salivary glands of the rat with sialoadenitis, which replicated in mousederived A 31 (3 T 3) cell culture. However, strain #681, acquired from Bhatt's original isolate of SDAV, failed to replicate in 3 T 3 cells [18] . Although LBC cells do support the replication of SDAV, these cells are not widely available and have a doubling time of approximately twice as long as L-2 cells. In addition, it is not possible to make a direct comparison of SDAV grown in LBC cells with other murine coronaviruses cultivated in L-2 cells.",

Optimal titers were obtained when that virus was propagated at 37 \u00b0C for 36 hours in medium at pH 7.5. In the case of both the L-2 and the LBC cells, 2 or more passages were required before infectious virus and/or viral antigen was detected. Serial passage presumably allowed for the selection of virions which could readily replicate in continuous cell cultures. The fact that LBC-adapted SDAV could be propagated in L-2 cells (and vice versa) on the first passage suggested that any alterations in the virion required for the replication in the two cell lines were similar if not identical.

Furthermore, the virus, when recovered from infected animals, could again infect L-2 cells and viral antigen could be readily demonstrated on the first passage. These data indicate that although the virus was adapted to replicate in L-2 cells, this strain was still capable of producing lesions typical of SDA in susceptible rats. Following 25 passages in L-2 cells, SDAV produced in culture failed to produce the typical lesions in salivary and lacrimal glands, although lesions were evident in the respiratory tract. Animals infected with 25th pass L-2 cell virus did, however, have significant antibody titers against SDAV. Experiments are currently underway to see if the immune response induced by the high passage virus is protective. Although attenuation of virulence following extended passage outside the natural host is a common phenomenon, the precise mechanism is not known. Further in vitro and in vivo characterization studies of the high and low passage SDAV are currently in progress.",
