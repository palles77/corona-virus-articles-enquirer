We utilized selected nsp2 deletion mutants to examine in vivo growth. Young swine (4 pigs/group; 5 control swine) were inoculated intramuscularly with one of 4 nsp2 deletion mutants (r 727-813, r 543-726, r 324-523, r 324-726) or full-length recombinant virus (rVR-2332). Serum samples were collected on various days post-inoculation and analyzed by HerdChek* ELISA, PRRSV real time RT-PCR, gamma interferon (IFN-\u2425) ELISA, and nucleotide sequence analysis of the entire nsp2 coding region. Tracheobronchial lymph node weight compared to body weight was recorded for each animal and used as a clinical measurement of viral pathogenesis. Results showed that all deletion mutants grew less robustly than full-length recombinant virus, yet all but the large deletion virus (r 324-726) recovered to parental viral RNA levels by study end. Swine receiving the r 727-813 mutants had a significant decrease in lymph node enlargement compared to rVR-2332. While swine infection with rVR-2332 caused a rapid rise in serum IFN-\u2425 levels, the IFN-\u2425 protein produced by infection with 3 of the 4 deletion mutant viruses was significantly reduced, perhaps due to differences in viral growth kinetics. The r 543-726 nsp2 mutant virus, although growth impaired, mimicked rVR-2332 in inducing a host serum IFN-\u2425 response but exhibited a 2-week delay. Targeted sequencing showed that all deletions were stable in the region coding for nsp2 after one swine passage. The data suggested that the selected nsp2 deletion mutants were growth attenuated in swine, altered the induction of serum IFN-\u2425, an innate cytokine of unknown function in PRRSV clearance, and pointed to a domain that may influence tracheobronchial lymph node size.",

This virus, belonging to the Nidovirales order, Arteriviridae family of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, can cause reproductive failure in pregnant sows, respiratory disease in growing swine and asymptomatic infection in boars. PRRSV is also subject to high frequency viral recombination, which has led to rapid evolution and the existence of a multitude of strains belonging to one of two genotypes, Type 1 (European-like) and Type 2 (North American-like). Growing evidence suggests the swine immune response is often ineffective against heterologous PRRSV strains primarily because of the nature of the virus itself Lopez and Osorio, 2004; Plagemann, 2004a,b) .",

            "text": "With the advent of reverse genetics for several strains of PRRSV, portions of the genome can be directly assessed for disease function. One such area is the region of the ORF1 replicase protein known as non-structural protein 2 (nsp2) (Snijder et al., 1995b; Tian et al., 2007; van Hemert and Snijder, 2008) , the most variable section of the genome (Han et al., 2006) . Based on considerable research on equine arteritis virus (EAV), the nsp2 protein is processed from the ORF1 protein by the action of the papain-like protease in nsp1\u2424 and the self-encoded PL2 cysteine protease, and acts as a co-factor for the nsp4 serine protease (3CL) in processing downstream viral cleavages (den Boon et al., 1995; Snijder et al., 1994 Snijder et al., , 1995a van Hemert and Snijder, 2008; Wassenaar et al., 1997) . In addition, EAV nsp2 induces double membrane vesicles, probably through its predicted transmembrane spanning regions, and serves as an anchor for the virus replication complex (Pedersen et al., 1999; Snijder et al., 2001) . Nsp2 of both genotypes of PRRSV is considerably larger than that of EAV and contains, in addition to the signature motifs described above, an extended N-terminal hypervariable region (HV1) and a middle hypervariable region (HV2). HV2 can differ in length by up to almost 150 amino acids. The two hypervariable regions of recombinant Type 2 strain VR-2332 (rVR-2332) were shown to contain amino acid segments not essential for replication in cell culture (Han et al., 2007) and recently, the cysteine protease domain (PL2) of strain VR-2332 was shown to possess both cis and trans cleavage activities and to cleave an expressed nsp2-3 construct at or near a downstream the predicted conserved G|G|G tripeptide (nsp2 amino acid residues 1196-1198) (Han et al., 2009; Ziebuhr et al., 2000) .",

Shown through bioinformatics to be related to the mammalian ovarian tumor domain (OTU) containing protease family, PRRSV PL2 enzyme is thought to be a new member of this class of novel cysteine proteases. The sequence conservation among over 100 OTU members centers on the motifs containing the putative catalytic Cys and His residues, which arterivirus PL2 proteases possess (Makarova et al., 2000) . PRRSV nsp2, when expressed individually in transfected 293T cells, decreases the level of ubiquitin and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) conjugates , indicating that the PL2 protease may deubiquitinate ubiquitinylated proteins. Protein ubiquitination has been shown to play a critical role in innate and adaptive cellular immune system induction by regulating several aspects of antiviral immunity such as NF-kB signaling, toll-like receptor/interleukin I signaling, MHC class I and II antigen presentation, and induction of type I IFN by the cellular viral sensor retinoic acid-induced gene I (RIGI) (Liu et al., 2005) . The OTU domain of EAV decreases the activation of an NF-kB-responsive promoter after TNF\u2423 treatment, which may indicate that the NF-B signaling pathway could be compromised by the presence of the arterivirus PL2 protease Hayden et al., 2006; Lenschow et al., 2007) .",

However, the B-cell responses were similar when measured by IDEXX HerdChek, and neutralizing antibody responses were varied among all swine. Thus, removal of these B-cell epitopes did not appear to have an effect on the antibody responses. Only IL-1\u2424 and TNF\u2423 expression levels were different, showing a much lower level of expression after cells were stimulated with the ES3 mutant than with the ES4 and ES7 deletion viruses, or with the parent virus. Importantly, no lung lesion data was given (Chen et al., 2010) .",

Here, infection of growing swine with rVR-2332 and four engineered nsp2 deletion viruses were used to assess their impact on viral replication and to examine potential changes in the host response. Serum samples taken at various times were examined for anti-PRRSV antibody, the level of virus or viral RNA detected, and the stability of the deletions. We found that anti-PRRSV antibody levels were quickly induced by all but the mutant virus with the largest nsp2 deletion (r 324-726), that all inoculated viruses would replicate animals but at different rates, and that the engineered nsp2 deletions were stably maintained. For examination of the innate immune response, we chose to survey serum IFN-\u2425, as a previous ) and serine/3C-like protease (3CLpro; ). Other signature motifs are also indicated: POL, RNA dependent RNA polymerase; C/H, cysteine/histidine rich; HEL, helicase; XendoU, Xenopus laevis homolog poly(U)-specific endoribonuclease. The short black bars ( ) indicate predicted nsp2 transmembrane regions. Hypervariable regions of nsp2 (HV1 and HV2), defined previously, are shown in solid grey (Han et al., 2006). study had shown the level of this cytokine rose soon after infection with Type 2 PRRSV strains SDSU73 and JA142, peaked after 10 days and remained in the serum for approximately 3 weeks (Wesley et al., 2006) . We found that similar high serum IFN-\u2425 levels were induced by recombinant PRRSV strain VR-2332, but that the nsp2 deletion mutants differed from the parent virus in that all but one mutant did not elicit IFN-\u2425, and the mutant that did elicit this innate cytokine (r 543-726) showed a marked delay in doing so. Lastly, clinical severity was completed through lymph node weight to body weight measurements, as the ratio had been shown to be a reliable indicator of lymph node enlargement (Mengeling et al., 2003) . In this study, only the smallest deletion mutant virus (r 727-813) resulted in decreased lymph node hyperplasia.",

In the present study, results suggested that the change in viral growth kinetics of the engineered nsp2 mutant viruses of strain VR-2332 may be related to the quality of the host response, as was indicated previously with Type 2 strain JA142 (Greiner et al., 2000) . Only the smallest nsp2 deletion resulted in a virus (r 727-813) that significantly reduced both the IFN-\u2425 levels in serum and the degree of lymphadenopathy observed at necropsy, which corresponds to a deletion of only 4 predicted B-cell epitopes. Removal of B-cell epitopes located elsewhere in nsp2 reduced IFN-\u2425 levels, but did not alleviate lymph node enlargement. Thus, no direct correlation between the numbers of nsp2 predicted B-cell epitopes and the level of lymph node involvement. However, removal of individual sections of nsp2 hypervariable region 2 was shown to have a differential effect on the viral kinetics and clinical disease phenotype.",

The swine chosen were not necessarily the same swine sampled for deletion verification and preliminary sequence analysis. The PCR products, at 35 day postinfection, were of low abundance and could not be sequenced directly.

Results of anti-PRRSV antibody levels determined by HerdChek* ELISA are illustrated in Fig. 2 . All animals were seronegative to PRRSV until 9 days postinfection. By day 14, anti-nucleocapsid antibodies were discerned in Groups 1 (r 727-813; 87AA), 2 (r 543-726; 184AA) and 5 (rVR-2332), as normally seen with PRRSV field isolates. Group 3 (r 324-523; 200AA) swine did not seroconvert until day 21 and one out of four pigs in Group 4 (r 324-726; 403AA) seroconverted at day 21 and another at day 35. The two remaining animals in Group 4 did not seroconvert in the course of this study, although one displayed an S/P ratio of 0.387, near the baseline set by the manufacturer for seroconversion (0.400). The data suggested that 87AA or 184AA deletions in the nsp2 hypervariable region 2 carboxyl terminus had no detrimental effect on seroconversion of swine when compared to the parental recombinant clone, but that a 200AA deletion near the N-terminus of the hypervariable region and a 403 AA deletion, which included the majority of the region, retarded the appearance of anti-nucleocapsid antibodies. There were no statistical differences detected in the S/P ratios induced by the recombinant viruses on days 28 and 35, except for the large deletion virus. Lastly, no neutralization was detected in serum from any animal (data not shown).",

All deletion virus swine sera at this time were first examined for maintenance of nucleotide sequence immediately surrounding the respective engineered deletion site, and the NC swine sera were similarly analyzed using primers encompassing all of the nsp2 deletion regions. All animals retained the correct nsp2 nucleotide sequence (data not shown). After successful RT-PCR amplification of the entire nsp2 gene from 2 pigs/group, 2 DNA products/pig were cloned and 2 of the individual clones were used for nucleic acid sequencing. Silent and mostly single nucleotide changes were scattered throughout the nsp2 gene but it was uncertain as to whether these were due to viral growth in the animal or acquired during amplification and cloning. However, the amounts of nucleotide variation shown in the deletion mutants and rVR-2332 after 35 days of viral growth compared to the starting viruses were similar, suggesting that the mutated nsp2 regions were as stable as the native gene. No universal nucleotide changes from rVR-2332 were seen. Most importantly, all engineered deletions were stable, possessing no additional insertions or deletions in nsp2 (Fig. S1 ). Some predicted amino acid changes were detected in one or both clones of each mutant after alignment with the inoculating virus sequence. Only four amino acid changes were seen in all sequenced products of the individual mutants [Group 1 -H653Q; Group 3 -G648E and R710W; Groups 2-5 -K1125E (using full-length nsp2 residue numbering)], but all showed 99.2-99.6% amino acid similarity to the respective parent nsp2 sequence and the significance of these changes could not be determined (Fig. S1 ).",

One pig from group 3 (r 324-523) had an extraordinarily high IFN-\u2425 level at 7 days (552 pg/ml), which was reproducible. This data point was 4.5 times greater than the next highest serum value detected at any point in the study in any pig (data not shown). When the data value for that pig on that day was removed from the analysis, the group mean (n = 4) for that day was 0 (versus 138 pg/ml). The daily standard deviations with this pig excluded from the data set ranged from 0 to 26. The standard deviation for serum IFN-\u2425 levels in all other pigs on day 7 was 5.0, suggesting the value for this one pig was an extreme statistical outlier. Therefore, an analysis of the overall data set was run with the value for this pig on that study day omitted. The effect of removing this data point reduced the treatment group standard error for the least squares mean estimate on day 7 from 21.2 to 7.9. A pattern of IFN-\u2425 response to PRRSV strain VR-2332 emerged when this pig at day 7 was removed from consideration (Fig. 6) . The rVR-2332 virus induced a significant biphasic increase in serum IFN-\u2425 levels. The initial increase was observed at day 2 post-inoculation followed by increases peaking on day 11 post-inoculation. These increases were statistically significant on post-inoculation days 2, 11 and 14 and began to decline by day 21. Overall, based on the nsp2 deletion mutant strain of VR-2332 given to pigs, there was a significant effect on elevation of serum IFN-\u2425 levels (P = 0. 0005). Two groups of pigs receiving different virus constructs (rVR-2332 and r 543-726) had significant increases in serum IFN-\u2425 levels above zero over the course of the study. There was a low background level of detectable serum IFN-\u2425 in the noninoculated control pigs, but rVR-2332 and r 543-726 groups were still different from the sham-inoculated control group (P = 0.0007 and 0.04, respectively). Swine in groups 1, 3 and 4 did not produce any IFN-\u2425 above background controls when inoculated with the respective PRRSV deletion mutant.",

Since r 324-726 (Group 4) did not replicate well in swine, the significance of the lower LNW/BW ratio could not be appropriately evaluated. The other swine groups showed typical lymph node enlargement, a diagnostic indicator of infection with PRRSV.

Three deletion mutants possessed in vitro growth phenotypes very close to the parent virus, but the mutant with the largest deletion, r 324-726, had been previously found to replicate poorly in cell culture. The targeted section for deletion was located within nsp2 hypervariable region 2 and contained 24 predicted antigenic epitopes (Kolaskar and Tongaonkar, 1990) . The recombinant viruses chosen had as few as four (r 727-813) and as many as 20 (r 324-726) of these epitopes removed. However, other undescribed nsp2 interactions with the immune system, such as the ability to deubiquitinate cell proteins, may have also been compromised as a result of defined nsp2 deletion. We sought to understand the differential effects nsp2 HVR2 deletion had on virus in vivo growth kinetics and potential correlations with the antibody responses, number and position of putative B-cell epitopes, the innate immune response protein INF-\u2425 and particular clinical disease manifestations over the 35 day experiment.",

            "text": "We found that all of the mutant viruses replicated in vivo, and all but the virus with the large deletion (r 324-726) induced a strong IDEXX anti-nucleocapsid antibody response. The response mirrors the viral growth in swine as measured by virus isolation, with rVR-2332 reaching the highest titers and gradually decaying over time. The three smaller deletion mutants (87, 184 or 200 AA removed) grew approximately 10-100-fold less vigorously, but were nonetheless able to induce antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein rapidly. A notable delay in antibody response was seen in three of four animals infected with the mutant harboring the largest nsp2 deletion, but was the first indicator that this virus had indeed replicated in swine. We also examined PRRSV RNA copies detected by Real-Time RT-PCR, and noted that this measurement approximated the virus isolation results, but was more sensitive to viral nucleic acid and was able to discern a small and stable amount of the large deletion mutant viral RNA at later times in infection. The shape of most curves in both assays suggests a cyclical nature for PRRSV growth. When the lung lavage fluids were examined by the same assays, it appeared that the viruses infecting Group 1 (r 727-813, 87 AA deletion) and 2 (r 543-726, 184 AA deletion) animals were able to persist in the lungs as well as native VR-2332 nsp2. We also sought to determine if the viral mutants were genetically stable during replication in swine, and found that although there were periodic silent nucleotide changes and some amino acid changes, no further editing of the engineered deletions in nsp2 was detected, suggesting the virus adapts readily to mutation in this hypervariable part of the replicase protein, as has been amply noted in the field (Fang et al., , 2007 Gao et al., 2004; Greiner et al., 2000; Han et al., 2007; Li et al., 2007; Ropp et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2008) . Sequence analysis of the entire genomes of these interesting viral mutants after growth in swine, which are underway, will have to be completed in order to examine changes that may have occurred outside of the nsp2 region.",

            "text": "IFN-\u2425, an important cytokine produced during the early stages of infection by macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, T cells and alternative cells types is a mediator for cellular immunity. Previous work reported that PRRSV Type 2 strains JA-142 and SDSU-73 induced release of IFN-\u2425 into the serum of infected animals whereas two other viruses, porcine coronavirus and swine influenza virus, did not induce comparable IFN-\u2425 serum levels (Wesley et al., 2006) . In order to examine whether this effect was seen after infection with PRRSV strain VR-2332 and to test if deletion of parts of the nsp2 HVR 2 would alter the response, the serum samples from the present study were assayed in the same manner, but with additional time points included. Again, we noted the paradoxically high levels of IFN-\u2425 in serum of swine that had been infected with full-length recombinant virus rVR-2332, but it also appeared to be biphasic in nature. However, only one deletion mutant, r 543-726, was able to generate a similar response in swine, although it was delayed by approximately 2 weeks. The other mutants showed no discernable rise serum IFN-\u2425 above the control group. When compared to the virus load diagrams, the peak of IFN-\u2425 appeared to precede the peak of viral titer or RNA load detected, which may have revealed a unique feature of infection caused by this persistent virus. The role of this interesting cytokine in the serum of PRRSV infected animals is thought to be critical but is still poorly understood. In addition, the effect of virus growth kinetics and the amount of circulating virus on inducing serum INF-\u2425 must be further studied.",

LNW/BW ratios revealed that only one mutant, r 727-813, caused a discernable decrease in lymph node enlargement over that seen with rVR-2332. Thus, the smallest deletion with only 87AA acids removed from nsp2 was able to induce diminished clinical disease whereas the larger upstream 187AA and 200AA deletions had no moderating effect. Bioinformatic analysis of the 87AA region did not yield any noticeable protein motifs, although the high proline content (10%) suggests a highly structured protein region. Finally, when comparing the putative antigenic regions discussed above, the regions containing 10 such motifs did not reduce the lymphadenopathy, while a region with only 4 domains significantly decreased this measurable sign of pathogenicity. Whether the reduction of the predicted B-cell epitopes results in an attenuation/exacerbation of other clinical signs must be examined using alternative PRRSV strains. However, the viral mutants described in this report will be extremely useful in the search for other modulators of PRRSV infection.",
