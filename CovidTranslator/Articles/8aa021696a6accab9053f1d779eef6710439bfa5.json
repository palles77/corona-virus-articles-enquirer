By definition, zoonotic pathogens can transmit from animals to humans; those also 58 capable of human-to-human transmission are of particular public health concern [5, 9] . Infectious 59 disease surveillance serves a crucial role for detecting and gathering information on zoonotic 60 pathogens: data obtained through surveillance are often the primary resource available for 61 informing public health management decisions [10]. Developing methods that improve our 62 ability to infer information about a pathogen's transmission dynamics from available 63 surveillance data is therefore an essential frontier for understanding and ultimately combating 64 these pathogens [11, 12]. 65 .

The first of these is the spillover rate, which indicates 67 how frequently the pathogen is transmitted from the animal reservoir into humans and helps 68 inform the total expected disease incidence [13]. The second measure describes the pathogen's 69 potential for further spread once in the human population and is commonly assessed using the 70 reproductive number (R), which gives the average number of secondary human cases caused by 71 an infectious individual [14, 15]. Values of R greater than one indicate that the pathogen is 72 capable of sustained (i.e. 'supercritical') transmission in humans. Pathogens with subcritical 73 transmission (R less than one but greater than zero) can cause limited chains of transmission in 74 humans after a zoonotic introduction, and they pose a risk of acquiring ability for supercritical 75 transmission via evolutionary or environmental change [2,5,16]. The third epidemiological 76 measure is the distance over which human-to-human transmission occurs, which informs how 77 the disease will spread spatially and the risk of it being introduced into new populations. 78",

However, these approaches 122 either require detailed case investigations to determine whether a case was infected by a zoonotic 123 or human source or assume that each cluster is caused by one single spillover event followed by 124 human-to-human transmission. A likelihood-based approach for estimating R for human-to-125 human transmission using only symptom onset dates of cases was introduced by Wallinga and 126 Teunis [31]. This method was extended to apply to zoonotic systems by Lo Iacono et al. [32], but 127 the extension requires that chains of exclusively human-to-human transmission can be identified, 128 and is thus not applicable to many zoonotic surveillance systems where human and zoonotic 129 transmissions are intermixed.

Our 146 approach builds on methods introduced by White and Pagano [33] and Kucharski et al. [34] , but 147 allows continuous spillover throughout the surveillance period and makes use of available spatial 148 information on case location. While the method could be readily adjusted to incorporate more 149 than with individuals from other localities, and therefore that infection is more likely to be 158 transmitted within a locality. However, the total number of localities under surveillance is 159 unknown because only localities with one or more cases appear in the dataset (the 'unknown 160 denominator' problem discussed above). We refer to the second spatial level as the 'broader 161 contact zone.' It describes a collection of localities that all occur within the same administrative 162 unit and likely share some amount of human movement. When multiple types of administrative 163 units of different sizes are reported in the dataset (e.g., districts, regions, provinces, etc.), the 164 ideal choice for broader contact zone is the smallest administrative unit that contains inter-165 locality human-to-human transmission events.

As such, there are 1326 unlikely to be strong biases introduced from a mis-specified offspring distribution for the 1327 monkeypox dataset, though this bias could increase if applied to pathogens with more extreme 1328 transmission variance. 1329",

Future surveillance programs could help mitigate this challenge by 633 recording a measure of surveillance effort undertaken at each location and time. 634This work assumes that R is constant across all localities; however, to obtain a full picture 635 of pathogen emergence risk, it may be necessary to consider the heterogeneity in transmission 636 intensity among different human populations, as well as the interplay between where R is highest 637 versus where spillover tends to occur [61]. In some zoonotic systems, for instance, spillover 638 predominantly occurs into remote villages and towns that are in close proximity to forested 639 regions. However, we generally expect these villages to have lower levels of human-to-human 640 transmission than the more densely-packed cities [62-64]. A pathogen may even be incapable of 641 supercritical spread until it reaches such a city. Therefore, to assess the probability a pathogen 642 will successfully emerge and to determine which populations to target with control measures, it 643 may be necessary to establish not only the spillover rate and R across different populations, but 644 also the rate of dispersal of the pathogen between those populations[61]. 645Several assumptions may need to be modified when applying this method to other 646 zoonotic systems. Because we assume that the source of human-to-human transmission events 647 will show symptoms before the recipient, the likelihood function can treat human cases as 648 occurring independently conditional on preceding cases.

While appropriate 655 when there are few human infections or in the early stages of invasion, this assumption could 656 bias estimates if applied in a system with sufficiently high levels of human infection or where 657 transmission occurs primarily among highly clustered contacts, such as individuals within a 658 household. We also note that in the monkeypox example we are estimating the effective 659 reproductive number, which takes into account existing population immunity. If the goal instead 660 were to establish the basic reproductive number (the reproductive number for the pathogen in a 661 fully susceptible human population), accounting for past exposure to the pathogen or other cross-662 immunizing pathogens or vaccines would be necessary. 663 The current methods assume that all human cases that occur during the surveillance 664 period inside the surveillance area are observed. This assumption is plausible for the analysis of 665 the 1980s monkeypox dataset, given the unusually high resources and experience level of this 666 surveillance effort in the aftermath of the smallpox eradication program and the use of serology 667 to detect missed cases retrospectively [43]. However, most zoonotic surveillance systems operate 668 with limited resources and have a much lower detection rate. Ignoring unobserved cases will lead 669 to underestimation of the spillover rate, while the effect on estimation of R will depend on the 670 nature of the surveillance program. For instance, in the chain-size analyses of Ferguson et al. 671 [28] and Blumberg and Lloyd-Smith [16], R is underestimated when the detection probability of 672each case is independent of one another or when right-censoring occurs but overestimated when 673",

The details of the derivation for the model are given in S1 Text, and 755 the final likelihood function is: 756 is the number of observed localities (localities with one or more cases) and E[V] is the 758 expected number of localities given the parameter values and the number of observed localities. 759 Parameter estimation. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was used to obtain the posterior 760 distributions of the model parameters. The fraction of transmissions occurring within a locality 761 (\u03c3) and the reproductive number (R) were given uniform priors on zero to one. The expected 762 number of spillover events per locality per day (\u03bb z ) was given a uniform prior with a lower bound 763 of zero and an upper bound selected to be far above the converged posterior distribution (ranging 764 from 0.0075 to 1, see S10 Fig for comparison of spillover priors and posterior distributions). 765 The chains were run for 100,000 steps, with a burn-in of 20,000. They satisfied visual 766 inspection for convergence. In addition, the Gelman and Rubin multiple sequence diagnostic was 767 evaluated for three parallel chains from each of the models for the monkeypox dataset [67]. The 768 Gelman-Rubin potential scale reduction values were less than 1.00033 across all models, 769 indicating that the chains have converged close to the target distribution [68]. 770 DIC model comparisons 771 For the monkeypox dataset, four assumptions about the choice of broader contact zone 772 were compared using the deviance information criterion (DIC). This approach combines a 773 complexity measure, used to capture the effective number of parameters in each model, with a 774 measure of fit in order to perform model comparisons. Models are rewarded for better 775 'goodness-of-fit' to the data and penalized for increasing model complexity. Similarly to the 776 preferred. As a rule of thumb, a difference between models' scores of four or more 778 generally indicates that the model with the larger value is 'considerably less' well supported by 779 the empirical evidence [69]. The values necessary to calculate the DIC can be readily obtained 780 from the MCMC output [70]. 781 Transmission tree reconstruction 782 The origin of cases (zoonotic spillover, intra-locality human-to-human transmission, or 783 inter-locality human-to-human transmission) and the distances of inter-locality human-to-human 784 transmission events (when case localities are known) can be established given a particular 785 transmission tree. To gain estimates of these measures, trees were sampled based on the model 786 and the parameter posterior distributions. From the MCMC output (representing draws from the 787 posterior distribution), d 1 sets of parameter estimates were drawn to create d 1 transmission-788 probability matrices (P). The entry P ij describes the probability that individual i was infected by 789 individual j. The diagonal values of the matrix represent the probability a case originated from 790 zoonotic spillover. For a case i observed to occur on day t in locality v, the probability that case j 791 was the source of case i (P ij ) was taken to be the proportion of \u00b5 t,v (the expected total number of 792 cases on that day and locality; defined in equation 2) contributed by case j. By sampling d 2 793 transmission trees from each of these transmission-probability matrices, we calculated the 794 proportion of cases that resulted from spillover, within-locality transmission, and between-795 locality transmission in each sampled tree. When testing the method using 125 simulated 796 datasets, 200 sampled transmission trees were generated for each dataset, with d 1 =20 and d 2 797 =10. For the monkeypox dataset, 20,000 transmission trees were generated with d 1 =200 and d inter-locality human-to-human transmission events in the monkeypox 800 dataset, if the GPS coordinates were known for both localities in a transmission pair, the 801 transmission distance was calculated using the gdist function in the R package Imap [71]. The 802 'null distribution,' used for comparing the number of inferred inter-locality transmission events 803 with the number expected to occur if spatial location played no role in transmission, was 804 calculated by pooling all cases for which locality GPS coordinates are known, sampling all inter-805 locality pairs permitted by the model, and recording the distance between the localities in each 806 pair. 807Simulation of test datasets 808To test the effectiveness of the methods, datasets with known parameter values were 809 simulated using the model explained above. Simulations were run over 1825 days 810 (approximately 5 years) and 325 surveilled localities. The localities were assumed to be 811 partitioned across thirty districts and six regions, with the distribution of localities across districts 812 and regions similar to that observed for the monkeypox dataset. The generation time interval (the 813 number of days between symptom onset of the source and recipient cases) was assumed to 814 follow a negative binomial distribution with a mean of 16 days and a dispersion parameter of 815 728.7 (as described above), with a maximum generation time interval of 40 days. A number of 816 parameter sets, as well as different underlying model structures, were used for simulations (S6 817",

During the peak surveillance period, between 1982 and 1986 [72], 826 data on 331 cases of laboratory-confirmed human monkeypox were recorded (see Fig 2, S1 827 Data) [43]. As part of field investigations, mobile teams visited the locality of a monkeypox case 828to collect information about the case, such as the date of fever and rash onset(for this study, the 829 symptom onset date was taken to be the fever onset date; if the date of onset was not recorded, 830 the rash onset date was used instead), as well as to identify individuals who had had close contact 831 with the case [52,73]. If one of these contacts developed monkeypox within 7 to 21 days of first 832 exposure, the presumptive source case was recorded (S2 Data) [43,73]. 833 Between 1982 and 1986, human monkeypox cases were observed in 171 distinct 834 localities, distributed among 30 districts and administrative subregions (simply referred to as 835 'districts') and 6 regions. The total number of localities that could have been detected by 836 surveillance is unknown.
