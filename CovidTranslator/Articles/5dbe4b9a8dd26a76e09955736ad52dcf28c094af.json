In the PCA model, each individual (represented by a cell in the lattice) is mainly locally connected to others. We investigate how the topological properties of the random network representing contacts among individuals influence the transient behavior and the permanent regime of the epidemiological system described by ODE and PCA. Our main conclusions are: (1) the basic reproduction number (commonly called R 0 ) related to a disease propagation in a population cannot be uniquely determined from some features of transient behavior of the infective group; (2) R 0 cannot be associated to a unique combination of clustering coefficient and average shortest path length characterizing the contact network. We discuss how these results can embarrass the specification of control strategies for combating disease propagations.",

In these epidemiological studies, the population is divided in three groups, as in the classical SIR model proposed by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 (e.g. Anderson and May, 1992; : the group S represents the individuals that are susceptible and thus subjected to the infection; the group I is formed by the individuals that are infected and can transmit the disease for susceptible ones; and the group R is composed by the individuals that are recovered. Equivalences with models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are explored in some works (e.g. Ahmed et al., 1998; Fuentes and Kuperman, 1999; Monteiro et al., 2006a Monteiro et al., , 2007 , since ODE are a mean-field approximation for PCA if the three groups (S, I and R) are homogeneously distributed in space.",

            "text": "In PCA models, in order to represent an infection process with a short-range character, each cell in the lattice (usually corresponding to an individual in the population) interacts with two (e.g. Ahmed et al., 1998) , four (e.g. Yakowitz et al., 1990) or eight surrounding neighbors (e.g. Doran and Laffan, 2005; Fuentes and Kuperman, 1999; Monteiro et al., 2006a Monteiro et al., , 2007 Sirakoulis et al., 2000) . In fact, disease-causing contacts form a connection network among individuals and the assumption of a topology in which the couplings are local and regular is just a first approximation. When longrange interactions are also taken into account, random coupling topologies are frequently employed (e.g. Boccaletti et al., 2006; Kleczkowski and Grenfell, 1999; Newmann, 2002) and relations among topological properties and features of the epidemiological dynamics (for instance, the number of infective individuals in the permanent regime) are investigated (e.g. Hartvigsen et al., 2007; Pautasso and Jeger, 2008; Xu et al., 2006) . Besides differences in the coupling topology, variations usually found in epidemiological studies based on PCA include: the use of non-isotropic lattices (e.g. Kansal et al., 2000) ; the consideration of more than one individual living in each lattice cell (e.g. Doran and Laffan, 2005) ; the absence of the recovered group for modelling diseases where the cure does not confer immunity (e.g. Fuentes and Kuperman, 1999) ; the inclusion of a latent group composed by infected individuals, but not yet infective ones (e.g. Ward et al., 2007), etc. In this work, the random contact network is formed by C connections starting from each cell (individual) in the PCA lattice to other cells pertaining to the square matrix of size 2r + 1 centered in such a cell; i.e., C connections start from the cell occupying the central position of its neighborhood matrix (two or more connections between the same two cells are allowed) and r is the maximum radius where a connection can be made. Of course, such a cell can receive connections starting from other cells, hence its actual number of neighbors is commonly greater than C. The case r = 1 including all eight surrounding cells is called the Moore neighborhood of unitary radius (e.g. Wolfram, 1994) . We assume that the probability q i of settling a connection between the central cell and any cell pertaining to the layer i is given by",

Thus, the probability of connecting the central cell to any of the 8 cells forming the layer i = 1 is 1/2, to any of the 16 cells forming the layer i = 2 is 1/3, and to any of the 24 cells forming the layer i = 3 is 1/6.

This parameter characterizes the transmission intensity of a particular disease in a particular population and it is interpreted as a threshold criterium: if R 0 > 1, the number of infected individuals increases and there occurs outbreak and/or persistence of the disease; if R 0 < 1, the number of infected individuals declines and the disease eventually disappears. Hence, determining the value of such a parameter is important to predict the temporal evolution of a disease in a population. Here we study the relations among R 0 , the parameters r and C and the topological properties of the contact network generated by Eq. (1) and discuss how these results can affect the specification of strategies for controlling disease spreadings.",

Slaves had a very limited value of r, but the increase of C caused by gathering them in a ship increased the value of R 0 of such a population, which made easier the propagation of diseases. Cases illustrating the influence of r in disease propagations can also be easily found. For instance, sailing ships developed mainly from the 13th century amplified the human mobility on the world; consequently, the value of r and the incidence of epidemics.

Because distinct values of topological properties can produce the same value of R 0 in a model considerating the spatial structure of the contact network, it is difficult to evaluate the effective contribution of each control measure, like isolations of SARS cases, quarantine of their asymptomatic contacts and restrictions on long-range population movement. Of course, all these interventions decrease (r and C, and consequently) R 0 and help to reduce the transmission. However, the weight of each intervention in the global result is far from being understood, possibly because the correspondences among R 0 and the topological properties of the contact network are not one-toone.

(2006) quantified the impact of distinct control measures (such as filtration, isolation, vaccination) in containing the propagation of indoor airborne infections (like chickenpox, influenza, measles, SARS); however, they did not take into account the contact network.

Is there a critical value F c < 1 so that if the fraction F = F c of the S-individuals takes precaution measures, then the disease is eradicated? In other words, the effective value of R 0 can be decreased below 1 only with these attitudes? (3) Our simulations showed that random contact networks with distinct topological parameter values can result in the same value of R 0 for the same disease. One can wonder if the two control strategies mentioned in the items (1) and (2) when separately applied against a particular disease would lead to networks with distinct topological features but with similar values of R 0 . (4) Which of these two strategies can reduce R 0 below 1 requiring the lowest value of F c ? (5) Vaccination is frequently modelled either as a conversion of S-individuals to R-individuals or as a decreasing in the birth rate of S-individuals (e.g. Bauch and Earn, 2004; Shulgin et al., 1998) . Thus, this control strategy seems not be directly related to changes in the topological properties of the contact network. However, if there exists a vaccine against the disease under analysis, what is the optimum combination among these strategies (isolation, prevention, vaccination) in order to eradicate such a disease? Here \"optimum\" can be interpreted as lowest cost and/or highest quality of life.",
