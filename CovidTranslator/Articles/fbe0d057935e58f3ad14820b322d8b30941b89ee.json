            "text": "China has become the world's largest foreign exchange reserve holder, having amassed almost US$ 2 trillion of international reserves by the end of 2008 (Fig. 1) . 1 The rapid accumulation of reserves has generated several controversies. One concern is whether this continuing balance of payments surplus signals the need for a substantial revaluation or appreciation of the Chinese Yuan (CNY) to protect China both from the inflationary consequences of the liquidity buildup and a misallocation of resources 2 as well as to help ease global economic imbalances. An alternative view, particularly associated with Schnabl (2003a,b, 2004) , argues that a fixed exchange rate is an optimal policy for China and the larger Asian region both on the grounds of macroeconomic stability and rapid economic development. The global monetarist approach of McKinnon is based on the assumption of little or no sterilization of reserve accumulations, so that any payments imbalance is temporary. However, many other commentators have suggested that the Chinese government's concern with inflation has led the People's Bank of China (PBC) to heavily sterilize these reserve inflows. 3 Contrary to the wide spread concerns among many economists about the huge size of current global economic imbalances, Dooley et al. (2004) famously argued that mainstream economists have failed to recognize that we are now in a new informal version of the Bretton Woods system (BW2) and the global economy is therefore not in genuine disequilibrium. While there are clearly important analogies between the current international monetary system and Bretton Woods (BW1), the question is still open as to whether we are currently closer to the early or late days of BW1. 4 In the later days of BW1 much attention was given to the concept of countries as reserve sinks into which reserves flowed. Instead of stimulating adjustments, as assumed in global monetarist models, the reserves effectively disappear from the system (down the sink) and hence contributed to continuing disequilibrium. Germany was seen as the prototype of the reserves sink during the BW1 days. Today China appears to be playing that role. Thus investigating how China has reacted to its reserve increases is of international as well as national importance. 5 An intermediate view is that while China has sterilized most of its past reserve increases, continuing to do so is becoming increasingly difficult for China as its reserves continue to rise and capital controls 3 Note that one can still use a monetary approach to consider the implications of sterilization. Indeed, Mussa (2008) takes this approach and argues that stabilization is a major reason for China's continuing balance of payments surpluses. 4 On the issues see the analysis and references in Eichengreen (2006) and Bird and Willett (2008) . 5 See Willett (1980) for references to this literature. become more porous (Prasad, 2005; Prasad and Wei, 2005; Xie, 2006) . One of the reasons why there is so much disagreement is because, as Goodfriend and have noted, ''(t)he fraction of reserves sterilized by the central bank has varied over the last few years and it is not straightforward to assess exactly how much sterilization has taken place.'' This paper estimates the degree of recent sterilization in China, as well as the degree of capital mobility as measured by offset coefficients, i.e. the fraction of an autonomous change in the domestic monetary base that is offset by international capital flows. 6 In one sense, the level of sterilization can be observed from the degree to which the central bank takes action to offset the effects of increases in international reserves on the domestic base or other monetary aggregates. However, this can offer a misleading picture of the effectiveness of sterilization. If the central bank wants the base to increase anyway, then it would decide not to neutralize the reserve increases; this would not imply that it had lost control of the domestic monetary process. China's large balance of payments surplus in 2003 was accompanied by rapid domestic money and credit expansion which is consistent with an inability to effectively sterilize. It appears, however, that the primary cause of the rapid expansion of money and credit was the Chinese government's concern with maintaining rapid economic growth, not the inability of the PBC to control the domestic monetary base. 7 Thus, the PBC did not try to fully neutralize the domestic monetary effects of the reserve increases under government direction.",

This in turn requires the estimation of the counterfactual of the desired rate of monetary growth, i.e. estimation of the central bank's monetary reaction function. There is no one correct theoretical specification for central bank reaction function, but the literature has developed a standard set of variables to be considered within this function. This allows us -at least in principle -to breakdown the interrelationship between international reserve changes and the monetary base into those relating to autonomous changes in the monetary base (the offset coefficient) and those relating to autonomous changes in international reserve flows (the sterilization coefficient). We also make use of recursive estimation to investigate changes in offset coefficients and sterilization over time. While we find no evidence of the inability of the government to sterilize a high proportion of reserve accumulations, we do find substantial increases over time in our estimates of the offset coefficients, suggesting that sterilization is becoming increasingly difficult.",

            "text": "The next section briefly explores the evolution of the balance of payments flows in China since 1999-2000, focusing on the magnitude and sources of reserve buildup as well as the reserve buildup's monetary consequences. It also briefly discusses the sterilization policy measures used in China (de jure sterilization). Section 3 offers a summary of the main empirical methodologies commonly used to estimate the de facto extent of sterilization. As will be discussed, the estimation procedure used in this paper is based on a set of simultaneous equations to estimate both the ''sterilization coefficient'' (i.e. how much domestic money creation responds to a change in international reserves) and the ''offset coefficient'' (i.e. how much balance of payments changes in response to a change in domestic money creation). Since the foreign exchange and the domestic monetary markets are interrelated, ignoring such interrelationships can lead to biased results. Section 4 discusses the data and definitions of variables to be used in the empirics and presents the empirical results of the sterilization and offset coefficients based on monthly data for the period from June 2000 to September 2008. This section also discusses a number of robustness checks. The results remain remarkably stable to the alternative estimation techniques used as well as to different proxies for exchange-rate expectations and for valuation changes in international reserves. We also present a recursive estimation which suggests that while remaining substantial, the degree of sterilization has fallen in recent years. The final section 6 After this paper was initiated, two other studies on sterilization in China by Burdekin and Siklos (2005) and He et al. (2005) became available. While using a different methodology, they reach broadly similar conclusions. These studies are considered in FN 40. 7 Lardy (2005) argues that the money expansion in 2003 was the government's mistaken overreaction to the potential adverse effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on economic growth.",

            "text": "China has experienced large and growing surpluses on both the capital and current accounts since 2001, while even the errors and omissions balance (a broad proxy for capital flight by residents) turned positive (Fig. 2) . Thus, reserves increased markedly during this period. An interesting dynamic appears to have taken hold in China (as well as in many other Asian economies) during this period. Large reserves are viewed as a sign that the domestic currency will eventually appreciate. They also tend to be taken as an indication of ''strong fundamentals,'' hence leading to an upgrading of the country's credit ratings. This expectation of future capital gains and lower risk perceptions motivated large-scale capital inflows and added to the country's stock of reserves as central banks have mopped up excess US dollars. From Fig. 3 , it is apparent that the swelling of China's capital account surplus since 2003 was largely because of a surge in portfolio capital flows as well as ''other investments'' (i.e. short-term debt flows), most likely a reflection of mounting market expectations of an impending revaluation of the Chinese currency (i.e. speculation on the CNY as a one-way trade). As noted by Prasad and Wei (2005) , ''much of the recent increase in the pace of reserve accumulation is potentially related to 'hot money' rather than a rising trade surplus or capital flows such as FDI that are viewed as being driven by fundamentals'' 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 (p.8). 9 conclude, however, that even with hot money flows excluded, China faced a substantial payments disequilibrium and while in 2004 IMF reports expressed doubts about whether the RMB was fundamentally undervalued, by 2006 the growing trade surplus had convinced most observers including the IMF that the RMB was fundamentally undervalued. Estimates of the extent of undervaluation varied enormously, however. 10 The Chinese government finally loosened its strict US dollar peg and allowed for a small revaluation from 8.28 to 8.11 CNY per US dollar in July 21, 2005 and simultaneously announced that the currency would be pegged to a basket of currencies. 11 Interestingly, China has since experienced a sharp increase in its trade surplus relative to the capital account despite expectations of continued upward pressure on the CNY 12 (i.e. one logically would have expected to see an intensification of speculative inflows). On the one hand, the decline in the capital account surplus was partly policy-induced. The government has been promoting outward investments by Chinese corporates and domestic institutional investors and has loosened a number of restrictions on capital outflows to ease some appreciation pressures from huge 1990-2007. 9 Three caveats should be noted. First of all, part of the change in reserves is also because of a valuation effect as a portion of reserves that was invested in non-US dollars (gold, euros, etc) has changed in US dollar terms (while most central banks including the PBC do not disclose the composition of assets in which reserves are being invested, it is generally suggested that a large part has been invested into dollar-denominated assets like Treasury securities). Prasad and Wei (2005) offer some ''guess-timates'' on the possible valuation effects. Secondly, there was a one-off fall in reserves in China in 2004. This was because since 2003 the government transferred US$ 60 billion to three state-owned banks, Bank of China (US$ 22.5 billion), China Construction Bank (US$ 22.5 billion), and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (US$ 15 billion) to aid in their recapitalization (see Ma, 2007 for details). And lastly, while China has not yet become fully convertible on the capital account, a large number of so-called ''qualified foreign investment institutions'' or QFIIs received approval by the China Securities Regulatory Commission to increase their investments to China which in turn has fuelled large-scale portfolio capital inflows (see Hu, 2005 for details). 10 On these issues see the analysis and references in Goldstein and Lardy (2008) . 11 The CNY has been on a very gradual appreciating path since ",

If a shock from foreign assets (say an unexpected increase in foreign assets) is associated with an offsetting decrease in domestic money creation, it can be concluded that the sterilization is significant. An important limitation of the VAR approach is that it tends to treat all variables as symmetrically endogenous.

There is of course a large literature on the determinants of monetary reaction functions, but to our knowledge Brissimis-Gibson-Tsakalotos (BGT) (2002) is the only instance in which the simultaneous equations used to estimate the NFAs and NDAs are explicitly derived from a theoretical framework (minimization of a simple loss function of the monetary authority subject to a number of constraints that reflect the workings of the economy). Ouyang et al. (2008) modify the BGT framework in a number of ways and apply it to several Asian economies (see Appendix 1). However, the modified framework cannot be applied directly to China which maintained a fixed peg to the US dollar until July 2005. Nevertheless, the vector of controls we use in the simultaneous model is informed by the modified BGT model and from existing empirical work in this area (for instance, see Celasun et al., 1999; Fry, 1993; Kim, 1995; Nyatepe-Coo, 1995; Sarjito, 1996; Rooskareni, 1998) .",

As can be seen from equations (4) and (5), the balance of payments function (Eq. (4)) consists of five control variables encompassing both ''push'' and ''pull'' factors as well as monetary policy responses, i.e. factors that motivate capital flows into specific recipient countries. We expect these variables to influence the balance of payments function in the following ways: First, a rise in the M2 money multiplier increases broad money and pushes the interest rate down, hence reducing capital inflows. In addition, a rising multiplier might be capturing an overall tightening credit policy, including a more restrictive policy towards capital inflows. 22 Second, higher inflation perpetuates concerns about exchange-rate depreciation, interest rate hikes and capital losses thereof, hence causing a reduction of capital inflows. 23 Third, higher real output could worsen the current account (due to the income effect), reducing foreign reserve accumulation. However, this variable is a double-edged sword in the sense that a domestic boom could perpetuate capital inflows directly (i.e. pull factor). Fourth, foreign reserves will be decumulated due to a decrease in the current account if the REER is positive (price effect). 24 Fifth, a fall in either the change in foreign interest rates or in the expected exchange-rate depreciation could lead to increased capital inflows from the country. 25 The monetary policy function (Eq. (5)) also consists of five control variables that are considered important factors influencing monetary policy actions. The monetary authority generally implements a contractionary monetary policy in response to a rise in inflation (for obvious reasons), an increase in the money multiplier (to curb overall money supply growth), or an expected exchangerate depreciation (either for its own sake or because of pass-through concerns). The expected coefficient for each of these variables should therefore be negative. In addition, the monetary authority tends to adopt a countercyclical monetary policy to contract domestic money creation when there is a rise in real GDP growth rate above the trend (i.e. a domestic economic boom) or a more expansionary fiscal deficit, implying a negative expected coefficient again. 26 We are least certain about the last variable as it is subject to a number of caveats. During an economic downturn there could be simultaneous use of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies and vice versa during an upturn in economic activity. It is also important to consider the context of expansionary fiscal policy. If done in the event of an economic downturn, the impact may not be the same as when output is at or above trend. 19 We also tried the M1 money multiplier but the results were not substantially changed. 20 Gerlach and Peng (2006) discuss various ways of measuring the output gap in a fast-growing and developing country, like China, that is undergoing significant structural changes. They find that various output gap measures, including estimates derived from the HP-filter rule, are quite highly correlated. 21 The exchange rate is in logarithms. As discussed in Section 4, we use three different assumptions for expected nominal exchange rate: perfect foresight, static expectations, and forward rates based on the NDF market for CNY. These all yield similar results. 22 It is plausible that a change in capital flows causes a concomitant change in the money multiplier (for instance, see Rajan, 2007) .",

Short of estimating the ''equilibrium'' REER we tried the deviation of the REER from its trend, but the results did not improve. See Section 4.3 for other robustness checks undertaken. 25 Two caveats should be noted. First, we use only foreign interest rates rather than interest rate differentials as the domestic interest rates are already captured in the DNDA t term. Second, there are two other potentially important push factors causing increased capital flows into China, viz. a fall in risk premium and rise in foreign wealth. The other push factor, viz. industrial country growth, is likely highly correlated with domestic country cyclical growth which is already included in the equation.

However, these valuation effects will not change the domestic currency value of the money base and we therefore need to exclude these effects from the book value of NFA before estimation.

Given the low interest rates in China as well as the fact that the majority of its capital inflows relate to the private financial account, we ignore these factors. 32 The Breusch-Godfrey serial correlation Lagrange multiplier (LM) test is used to check for the autocorrelation, while White's heteroskedasticity test is used to test the heteroskedasticity in the residuals. ARCH LM test is used to test for ARCH in the residuals. 33 Newey and West (1987) have derived a consistent covariance matrix estimator in the presence of both heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. Since we use the Newey-West HAC estimates we do not need to include lagged dependent terms as done by Brissimis et al. (2002) and others. likelihood ratio test is applied to lag length selection. Table 4 summarizes the results of the estimating equations. We have three sets of estimations depending on whether we assume perfect foresight, static expectations, or forward-looking expectations. Forward-looking expectations are captured using the three month forward rate (the one-month forward rate unfortunately being unavailable). The estimated offset coefficients are around 0.5 and are statistically significant, indicating a moderate degree of capital mobility and a degree of porousness of China's capital controls. The estimated sterilization coefficients are also highly statistically significantly significant at around 1, 34 suggesting that the PBC has heavily sterilized its reserve accumulations in the last nine years. The money multiplier is statistically and economically significant across all the estimations with the correct sign. Cyclical output is statistically significant and negative across all the estimations, which suggests that the income effect leading to a worsening of the current account may be greater than the direct impact that positive cyclical income has on attracting capital inflows. This again is consistent with international capital mobility for China being moderate rather than high. The lagged inflation term is statistically significant with negative (correct) signs across all regressions. The exchange rate adjusted foreign interest rate coefficients have the incorrect sign though they are generally statistically insignificant. Both the lagged REER and the cyclical fiscal deficit are statistically insignificant in balance of payments function and monetary reaction function, respectively.

The recursive offset coefficient remained fairly stable between early 2005 and mid 2006 at around 0.55, dropped slightly to around 0.45 till late 2007, before rising very gradually since then to average around 0.5 over 2008. With regard to the recursive sterilization coefficients, while sterilization peaked in early 2005, it has been declining ever since, reaching around 0.7 by late 2007 and has remained stable ever since. This suggests sterilization has been quite heavy but not complete in recent years.

As China has been sterilizing capital inflows fairly aggressively. We estimate that the PBC has typically sterilized around 90 percent of the reserve inflows, which is similar to those obtained by Burdekin and Siklos (2005) and He et al. (2005) . While Burdekin and Siklos (2005) suggest the PBC has over-sterilized the foreign reserves, they find the PBC has not done so sufficiently to prevent M2 (broader money supply) from increasing. 38 He et al. (2005) find that the PBC has fully sterilized the capital inflows, and most of the responses finish in a month. Our rolling recursive estimates suggest that while sterilization in China was virtually complete until early 2007, it has been partial -but still high at around 0.7 -between late 2007 and late 2008. This is consistent with views that as the large payments surpluses have continued, sterilization has become increasingly difficult. Our estimates of high sterilization over the period of China's recent huge buildup in reserves support the view that China has operated as a reserve sink, much as Germany and Japan did during the later stages of the Bretton Wood system. While Dooley et al. (2004) have suggested the current global economic imbalances are much less worrisome than most economists have suggested, the chaotic end of the Bretton Woods exchange-rate regime in the early 1970s is but one of many examples that large prolonged international payments imbalances seldom lead to happy endings.",

Indeed, in recent years with the absence of sterilization, China's peg would have been a source of substantial inflationary pressure. Going forward, the Chinese authorities would do well to continue to relax the management of the exchange rate, in addition to taking further steps towards deregulation of capital outflows in a judicious manner.

But we modify the BGT model in different ways (see Ouyang et al., 2008 for more details).The loss function of the monetary authority is: 38 In related work, Burdekin and Siklos (2005) regress the change of base money on the change of foreign reserves for the period of 1990:q1-2002:q4 and find that 1 unit increases in the change of foreign reserves will lead to decreases of 0.1-0.2 units in the change of base money (based on OLS and GMM). However, they also find that 1 unit increases in the change of foreign reserves has significantly increased M2 growth by 0.11 units. Using VAR analysis, He et al. (2005) find that sterilization intensity increased somewhat in 2003:m1-2004:m12 compared to 1998:m1-2002:m12 . They also find that 1 unit increases in NFAs will lead to a decline of around 1 unit in NDAs.",
