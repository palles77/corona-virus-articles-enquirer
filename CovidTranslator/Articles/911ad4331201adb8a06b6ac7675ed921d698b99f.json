Regulatory agencies, blood providers and medical professionals are continuously implementing and improving measures that can guarantee a safe blood supply. Much of this effort was initiated in the face of emerging infectious threats in the blood supply, as exemplified by the experience with HIV. Despite the implementation of the HIV blood screening test, one of the most successful reactive safety measures ever implemented, society still had to pay a high price in terms of human lives and health as a result of not being prepared for the emergent pandemic of AIDS [2] . This experience only emphasized the fact that, although a zero risk for blood transfusion is unattainable [3] , provision of the safest blood possible must remain one of the biggest commitments of world policy [4] .",

Methods: This prospective observational study was approved by the ethical committee of the University Clinic of Santiago de Compostela. Informed consent was asked from patients receiving M-PC. M-PCs were treated with the Mirasol system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thrombocytopenic patients were transfused according to the Spanish transfusion guidelines. Post-transfusion platelet counts were measured at 1 h and/or 24 h after transfusion. Post-transfusion surveillance of patients was maintained during the study. Results: Data from 54 evaluable patients and 135 transfusions were analyzed. The mean age of patients was 58 years. The mean age of M-PC at transfusion was 3.6 days. The mean platelet dose was 3.7 \u00d7 10 11 . The transfusion responses measured as mean corrected count increment 1 h after transfusion (CCI 1h ) and CCI 24h were 9,659 and 4,751, respectively. 65% of transfusions resulted in CCI 1h values 7,500. 51% of transfusions resulted in CCI 24h values 4,500. Conclusion: The use of M-PC in the supportive treatment proved to be safe and effective for this cohort of thrombocytopenic patients. Recently, the Blood Transfusion Center of Galicia assessed the quality of Mirasol \u00ae PRT-treated (Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO, USA) platelet concentrates (M-PC) and stored in platelet-additive solution for up to 7 days [7] . This technology uses riboflavin (vitamin B 2 ) and UV light to reduce the pathogen load and to inactivate contaminating white blood cells in blood components. Results of this study demonstrated acceptable platelet quality, which prompted the Blood Transfusion Center and the University Clinic of Santiago de Compostela to start a clinical study to investigate the performance of these products in the supportive therapy of thrombocytopenic patients. The study was designed to assess the feasibility, performance, and safety of M-PC stored for up to 7 days.",

Previous studies could show a clear relationship between transfusion failures, defined as increments below international recognized thresholds, and bleeding complications [8, 9] . This study design was chosen to enable a performance as close as possible to the routine process at the hospital and also allow for comparative analysis with other routine experiences reported in the literature [11, 12] . Thus, in this prospective study, count increment levels were used as markers of clinical performance. CCI 1h , a marker of platelet recovery, can be used as a surrogate for platelet quality; hence, results showing a rate of 65% effective transfusions in multiple transfused patients lie definitely within the expected levels of response and can confirm adequate platelet quality. This level of successful transfusions is slightly inferior to what has been reported by investigators in the Netherlands (72%), equal to what has been recently observed in Switzerland (65%) and superior to the reports from Norway (46%). In all of these instances, platelets treated with an alternative pathogen reduction technology had been used [10] [11] [12] . Moreover, the observed rate is slightly inferior to what was observed in the MIRACLE study after transfusion of M-PC (71.3%) [13] .",
