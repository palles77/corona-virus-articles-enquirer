            "text": "The association between a robust or depressed antibody response and clinical severity of SARS remains unknown. Objectives: To study seroconversion and the magnitude of IgG responses in a SARS cohort with different disease severities. Study design and method: A retrospective analysis of all acute and convalescent-phase sera collected from a cohort of laboratory-confirmed SARS cases. Anti-SARS-CoV IgG antibody was detected using indirect immunofluorescence technique and quantified by two-fold serial dilutions. Characteristics of patients who seroconverted \"early\" (<median interval) were compared to those documented to remain seronegative during the same time interval. Median IgG levels in convalescent-phase sera (collected within 30 days) were compared among patients with different disease severities. Correlations between IgG levels and important laboratory parameters were assessed. Results: A total of 325 laboratory-confirmed SARS cases were analyzed; of which 301 (92.6%) had anti-SARS-CoV IgG detected in their sera at the time of sampling. IgG was first detected on day 4 of illness; seroconversion occurred at a median of 16 days (range 4-35 days), and IgG peak levels were reached in the fourth week. Early seroconversion (<day 16) occurred more frequently among patients who required ICU-admission (\u03c7 2 ; p = 0.011). Higher IgG levels were detected in patients who required supplemental oxygen (Mann-Whitney; p = 0.002), ICU-admission (p = 0.001), had negative pre-discharge fecal RT-PCR results (p = 0.004), and lymphopenia at presentation (p = 0.028). Peak IgG titres also correlated positively with peak LDH levels (Spearman's r = +0.360; p < 0.001) among survivors. Conclusions: Severe SARS is associated with a more robust IgG response.",

A total of 325 laboratory-confirmed (by serology, RT-PCR or post-mortem) SARS cases were then retrospectively evaluated for their anti-SARS-CoV IgG response and clinical disease severity. Serum samples were first collected at presentation/admission and convalescentphase sera were collected either beyond 2 weeks of illness or >10-14 days apart from the acute-phase sera. All serum samples were dated from the day of fever onset. Anti-SARS-CoV IgG was detected by IFA using SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells; and IgG titres were quantified at two-fold serial dilutions starting from 1:40 (Chan et al., 2004a) . Routine respiratory specimens collected at presentation, and repeated fecal specimens collected upon discharge at \u226521 days of illness were tested for SARS-CoV by RT-PCR (non-quantitative), according to WHO recommendations (Chan et al., 2004b; WHO, 2004) . All serological and RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV were performed in a BSL-2 containment facility according to CDC recommendations (CDC, 2005) . The clinical characteristics and disease progression, investigation methods and details of treatment of this cohort of patients have been described elsewhere (Chan et al., 2004b; Gomersall et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2003a Lee et al., ,b, 2004 Sung et al., 2004) . SARS patients who required supplemental oxygen therapy during their course of illness or admitted to ICU as a result of severe respiratory failure were regarded to have more severe disease. Supplemental oxygen was prescribed to maintain patient's oxygen saturation >95% when necessary; and severe respiratory failure was defined by failure to maintain an arterial oxygen saturation of >90% despite receiving supplemental oxygen at 50%, and/or a respiratory rate greater than 35 breaths per minute (Gomersall et al., 2004) . High-dose corticosteroid 'rescue' therapy was given to patients when clinical and radiological progression was noted according to a standard protocol (Sung et al., 2004) . Age of 65 years was also used as a cut-off in the comparison between groups since epidemiological data had implicated advanced age as a poor prognostic factor (thus more severe disease) (WHO, 2004) . The cut-off value for lymphocyte counts in the comparison groups was determined based on earlier studies (Wong et al., 2003) .",

We excluded patients who had their first serum samples collected on day 0-3 (since IgG was only first detected on day 4 in our cohort), and those who had their first sera collected beyond day 15 (the median interval to serocon-vert) from fever onset. Median time of serum collections between all comparative patient groups was not significantly different. Secondly, median anti-SARS-CoV IgG levels in convalescent-phase sera collected within 30 days were compared among patients with different disease severities and laboratory profiles using Mann-Whitney U-test. Variables with p < 0.2 in the univariate analysis were then entered into a nonparametric regression model for analysis. Only the latest serum sample collected from each patient was included in the analysis. Median time of collecting these samples was not significantly different between all comparative patient groups. Thirdly, spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to assess correlations between IgG titres and LDH levels or lymphocyte counts within 30 days. SPSS for Windows (Release 11.5; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the analyses, and the level of significance was set at 0.05 for all comparisons.",

IgG can be detected as early as day 4 by IFA; seroconversion occurs by the end of the second week, and IgG surged to peak levels by the early fourth week. It has been reported that a \"second\" late rise in antibody titre can occur after week 4, possibly related to the withdrawal of corticosteroid treatment (Woo et al., 2004) . Thus our results may represent the initial rate of change of IgG levels within the first month; and they also need to be interpreted in the context of corticosteroid treatment. Our findings of more severe SARS being associated with more robust serological responses are supported by earlier observations. The development of the humoral response coincides temporally with disease progression and clinical deterioration (while viral load starts to decrease) (Hsueh et al., 2003; Nie et al., 2004; Peiris et al., 2003a) .

            "text": "Our findings have several important clinical implications. Firstly, it is unlikely that disease progression and clinical deterioration result from a depressed humoral response to SARS-CoV. In fact, high titres of anti-SARS-CoV IgG were detected in patients with more severe disease. Naturally occurring neutralizing antibody activity associated with the IgG may have contributed to viral clearance to some extent (Nie et al., 2004; Temperton et al., 2005) , but clearly did not confer protection against disease progression in SARS. This is also supported by our finding that higher convalescent-phase IgG titres are associated with negative pre-discharge fecal RT-PCR results. Secondly, it seems possible that a robust humoral response to SARS-CoV is one component of an overall exaggerated immune response in severe SARS, which is associated with cytokine storms (e.g IFN-gamma, IP-10) (Huang et al., 2005; Jiang et al., 2005; Wong et al., 2004) . Briefly, marked elevation of Th1 cytokine IFN-\u2425, inflammatory cytokines IL-1, -6 and -12 was noted during the initial 2 weeks of SARS. The chemokines, including neutrophil chemokine IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and Th1 chemokine IFN-\u2425-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) levels were also significantly elevated . In fact, when patients with detectable and undetectable acute antibody responses were compared, a much higher initial serum IFN-gamma level had been noted in the former (Huang et al., 2005) .",

Whether the humoral response contributes directly to organ damage is unclear. The exact immunopathogenesis of SARS requires further study. Finally, since higher levels of IgG were associated with more severe disease, the use of convalescent plasma/passive immunity in the treatment of SARS is called into question. It is uncertain whether administration of an exogenous antibody will lead to aggravation of the disease (Hsueh et al., 2003) . It has been suggested that if such therapy is contemplated, it should be given only very early in the course of illness or as prophylaxis (Greenough et al., 2005; Jan ter Meulen et al., 2004; Nie et al., 2004) .

The IgG response in patients without corticosteroid treatment remained poorly characterized. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that severe SARS is associated with a more robust IgG response. Further study on SARS immunopathogenesis is warranted.",
