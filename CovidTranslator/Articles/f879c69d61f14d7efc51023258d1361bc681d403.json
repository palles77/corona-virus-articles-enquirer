Majority of patients presented with lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Treatment with antiviral drugs was initiated in all the patients. Thirty-seven patients (82.2%) had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 13 (28.9%) septic shock. A total of 20 (44.4%) patients required intubation and 9 (20%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
