Both vaccines induced high rates of seroconversion (100%) and coproconversion (75-100%). The VLP+mLT vaccine induced Th1/Th2 serum cytokines and cytokine secreting cells, whereas the VLP+ISCOM vaccine induced Th2 biased responses with significantly elevated IgM, IgA and IgG antibody-secreting cells in intestine. Nevertheless, both vaccines induced increased protection rates against viral shedding and diarrhea (75-100%) compared to controls; however, only 57% of controls shed virus.",

These particles are antigenically similar to the native virion, can be produced at high yields using the baculovirus system, and are stable at low pH [9] , making them suitable for oral administration and mimicking the natural route of HuNoV infection [10] . Different strategies, have been used to produce HuNoV VLP, and their antigenicity has been evaluated in mice and in humans [11, 12] . The GI Norwalk-virus (NV) VLPs were administered intranasally (IN) to BALB/c mice in the presence or absence of the mucosal adjuvant, mutant Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin R192G (mLT). Low doses (10-23 \u00b5g) of NV VLPs were antigenic, and higher doses (200 \u00b5g) induced specific serum IgG, fecal and vaginal antibody responses. The use of mLT enhanced the immune responses [13] . The oral administration of 250 \u00b5g, or more of NV VLPs to human volunteers elicited 90% seroconversion and increased numbers of NV-specific IgA antibody-secreting cells (ASC) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but with only 30-40% of the volunteers developing NV-specific mucosal IgA antibodies [14] .",

Immunostimulating complexes (ISCOM) also constitute an alternative as both antigen delivery system and as adjuvant. These cage-like structures are composed of subunits built from the interaction of the surfactant saponins with lipid particles (cholesterol and phospholipids) [18] . Previous studies using the gnotobiotic (Gn) pig model showed that oral priming with attenuated human rotavirus (HRV) followed by 2 IN booster doses of RV inner capsid proteins, VP2/VP6 in 2/6 VLPs in combination with ISCOM, induced protection rates against diarrhea and virus shedding similar to those of the pigs that received the threedose attenuated human rotavirus (AttHRV) vaccine [19] , and boosted antibody titers and ASC responses [16, 19, 20] . This vaccine regimen provided high protection rates against diarrhea after challenge with virulent WaHRV and induced high virus neutralization and mucosal IgA antibody titers to HRV in the intestinal contents of Gn pigs [21] . Similar strategies using ISCOM-based HuNoV VLP vaccines have not yet been tested.",

We have recently demonstrated that pigs with the A + and/or H + phenotype had increased diarrhea and viral shedding rates compared to Gn pigs of non-A + or H + phenotypes, when inoculated with a GII.4 HuNoV strain [23, 24] . However, GII.2 Snow Mountain virus (SMV) infection was not dependent on the histo-blood group or secretor status [12] , and a more recent study showed that VLPs of the Bristol-like GII.4 strains, that have been implicated in various outbreaks globally for the last 10 years, did not bind to the saliva of 78% of secretor-positive individuals [25] , regardless of their blood type, raising questions about the role of these antigens for certain HuNoV strains in binding to and entering into target cells.",

The supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 3,000 X g for 30 min to pellet the cells and the assembled VLP were purified by CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation, as previously described [24] . Particle integrity and reactivity were tested by immuneelectron microscopy (IEM), antigen enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting, and protein concentration was evaluated by the Bradford quantification method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) [24] . The sterility of each VLP preparation was assessed by bacteriologic culture assays using blood agar plates and thioglycolate broth, at both room temperature (Rt) and at 37\u00b0C, for two weeks. The endotoxin levels were measured by using the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Association of Cape Cod, Woods, Hole, Mass) [19] .",

Serum samples were processed and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C [35] . The IC samples were diluted 1:2 in MEM with a protease inhibitor cocktail to prevent cytokine degradation [36] . The serum and IC were immediately frozen at \u221220\u00b0C until further testing. An ELISA test was performed to detect IL-6, IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-10 as previously described [35] . In addition to those cytokines, an ELISA to detect the porcine Th2 cytokine, IL-13 was also performed (anti-Hu IL-13 kit, Biosource, Camarillo, CA). Plates were coated with a polyclonal anti-human IL-13 (1.3 \u00b5g/ml), samples were added and then a biotin-labeled monoclonal antibody (MAb) to human IL-13 (1.5 \u00b5g/ml) (Biosource) was added followed by the addition of streptavidin-HRP (0.1 \u00b5g/ml) (Biosource) and TMB (KPL). Standard curves were generated using recombinant porcine IL-6 (Biosource, Camarillo, CA), IL-12 (R & D Systems), IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 (Biosource). A computer-generated four-parameter curve-fit was used to calculate the concentration of each cytokine.

A previous study in our lab [23] showed that the pigs with the A + and/or H + phenotype had increased diarrhea and viral shedding rates compared to non-A + and H + Gn pigs after infection with the GII.4 HuNoV-HS66 strain. Because all the pigs in the study were typed for the A/H phenotype and all pigs that were challenged with HuNoV had A + /H + phenotype, we cannot conclude that the A/H phenotype influenced the outcome of the study. However, the older age at which the Gn pigs were challenged could have played a role in the lack of virus shedding detected in the control group. In our previous studies we inoculated the pigs at an earlier age (3-to-7-day-old compared to 40-day-old) and maybe Gn pigs are more resistant to infection at an older age. However, because 7/7 (100%) of pigs in both the ISCOM and mLT control groups had diarrhea compared to only 1 pig in the VLP+ISCOM group, we assume that viral replication, undetectable at very low levels, may have occurred in the control pigs.",

The magnitude of the ASC responses in the intestine however, was not boosted by the HuNoV-HS66 challenge, likely reflecting the high degree of protection observed (no virus shedding).

Because no IL-4 was detected, the authors concluded that a dominant Th1 response was induced by the NV VLPs [14] . However, this must be interpreted carefully because other Th2 cytokines exist that were not evaluated; therefore, a more complete panel of cytokines should be evaluated before this conclusion is reached. We also evaluated the concentrations of another Th2 cytokine (IL-13) in the serum of the Gn pigs and significantly higher levels were detected at PID 28 and PID 30/PCD2 in the VLP+mLT group, when compared to the other groups. The IL-13 plays an important role in the modulation of the immune responses, especially to intracellular parasites [38] .

Pre-challenge, the VLP +ISCOM vaccine induced higher IgA and IgG ASC both systemically and locally and IgA and IgG antibodies in IC, with significantly elevated Th2 (IL-4) intestinal CSC postchallenge. In contrast, the VLP+mLT induced higher systemic Th1 and Th2/T-reg CSC numbers pre-challenge and the highest Th1 cytokine responses in IC, post-challenge. Collectively, our results indicate that VLP+mLT induced a more balanced Th1/Th2 response in serum pre-challenge, whereas the VLP+ISCOM induced a more Th2 biased response prechallenge, but with significantly higher systemic Th1 (IFN-\u03b3) and local and systemic Th2 (IL-4) CSC responses post-challenge. Both vaccines induced protection upon challenge with HuNoV, although protection against diarrhea was less efficient in the latter group. Based on these data, use of adjuvants with VLPs induce balanced Th1/Th2 immune responses but with significantly elevated intestinal ASCs (mLT) or more Th2 biased responses with significantly higher intestinal IgA and IgG ASCs (ISCOM), but can both induce adequate protection.",
