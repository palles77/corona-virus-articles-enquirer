Based on genetic and serological relationships, groups 1, 2 and 3 were previously recognized in the Coronavirus genus. In this report we present results of comparative sequence analysis of the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N) structural proteins, and the two most conserved replicase domains, putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and RNA helicase (HEL), aimed at a revision of the Coronaviridae taxonomy. The results of pairwise comparisons involving structural and replicase proteins of the Coronavirus genus were consistent and produced percentages of sequence identities that were distributed in discontinuous clusters. Inter-group pairwise scores formed a single cluster in the lowest percentile. No homologs of the N and E proteins have been found outside coronaviruses, and the only (very) distant homologs of S and M proteins were identified in toroviruses. Intragroup sequence conservation was higher, although for some pairs, especially those from the most diverse group 1, scores were close or even overlapped with those from the intergroup comparisons. Phylogenetic analysis of six proteins using a neighbor-joining algorithm confirmed three coronavirus groups. Comparative sequence analysis of RdRp and HEL domains were extended to include arterivirus and ronivirus homologs. The pairwise scores between sequences of the genera 2208 J. M.

Phylogenetic analysis confirmed toroviruses and coronaviruses to be separated by a large distance that is comparable to those between established nidovirus families. Based on comparison of these scores with those derived from analysis of separate ranks of several multi-genera virus families, like the Picornaviridae, a revision of the Coronaviridae taxonomy is proposed. We suggest the Coronavirus and Torovirus genera to be re-defined as two subfamilies within the Coronavirdae or two families within Nidovirales, and the current three informal coronavirus groups to be converted into three genera within the Coronaviridae.",

In another highly illustrative case, the results of comparative sequence analysis of replicative proteins [4, 41] were most vital for a decision to expel Hepatitis E virus from the Caliciviridae family, where it was originally placed using other non-sequence properties [5] . Results of comparative sequence analysis were also instrumental for the creation of the Arteriviridae family [17] and subsequent placement of this and Coronaviridae families into a newly designed Nidovirales order currently including also Roniviridae, all of which are morphologically different [13, 22, 45] . The experience proved that conserved sequence patterns common for this order are more reliable characteristics than other properties, including the spliced structural organization of subgenomic RNAs that was originally considered a hallmark of the Nidovirales [16, 26, 34, 46, 53, 59, 66, 71, 74, 84] .",

The replicase components are autoproteolytically derived from two polyproteins, one of which is produced through a frameshifting during virion RNA translation [7, 90] .

In this study we performed a systematical quantitative analysis of sequence conservation among four structural proteins of the Coronaviridae and two key replicase enzymes, putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase (HEL) of the Nidovirales. The results were correlated with non-sequence characteristics and rationalized using criteria that were derived from analysis of other virus families. Our analysis suggests that the Coronavirus and Torovirus genera should be re-defined as two subfamilies within the Coronaviridae or two families within Nidovirales, and the current informal three coronavirus groups to be converted into three genera within the Coronaviridae.",

In this study, the Block Maker was used to convert multiple alignments containing groups of coronavirus or torovirus sequences into the alignment blocks databases.

The Psi-Blast-mediated searches retrieved all coronavirus N, M and S proteins as separate groups that were subsequently aligned as described in the Material and Methods. Similar searches that were performed with E proteins produced four different families, two for coronavirus group 1 and one for each groups 2 and 3; these families are also listed in the protein family (PFAM) database [3] . To check whether these protein families are related, we performed LAMA-assisted across-families comparisons using 2 or 3 ungapped blocks that were derived from alignments of these protein families with the Block Maker tool. A fourfamilies-wide network of statistically significant interblock matches was detected in pairs of different protein families excluding only the families 2 and 3 pair. These data and similar genetic positions support the common origin of the different E proteins. Accordingly, four group-specific E protein alignments were merged into one coronavirus-wide alignment using the Clustalx1. 82 and T-Coffee programs.",

The C-terminal half is the most conserved part of S protein and released as S2 moiety by a cleavage of S protein.

            "text": "The dendrograms involving six analyzed proteins revealed similar topologies ( Fig. 3 to 8 ) that were compatible with the current distribution of coronavirus species among three groups [21, 67] . Each coronavirus group is supported by high bootstrap values for every protein analyzed. Group 3 is relatively compact, currently including data from just two species. Each of groups 1 and 2 includes two subsets of species. In the moderately diverged group 2, a subset including MHV and RtCoV species was confidently separated from the other including HCoV-OC43, BCoV and HEV species. In the most diverse and diverged group 1, Phylogenetic tree of E proteins of coronaviruses. The tree was generated using an alignment of E protein sequences from 44 virus isolates by applying the Neighbor-joining method in the CLUSTAL X v1.82 program. Bootstrap values higher than 50% are shown in the main branch nodes. AN, SP, and STR as in Fig. 1 TGEV, CCoV, FCoV, forming subgroup G1-1, were separated from substantially diverged HCoV-229E and PEDV, forming another subgroup G1-2. The topologies of group 1 sub-trees were found to be very similar for the M and N proteins but deviated for the other two proteins with respect to the positions of FCoV isolates. Pairwise similarity of the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) KU-2 strain S protein was unusually low (45% of identical residues) with homologs encoded by other group 1 coronaviruses [47] including other strains of FIPV. Furthermore, this virus failed a confidence test for the inclusion in the subgroup G1-1 (Figs. 1  and 3 ). The FIPV 79-1146 and the feline enteric coronavirus (FECoV) 79-1683 strains were interleaved with TGEV and other coronaviruses in the E protein tree (Fig. 4) , but together with FIPV KU-2 formed the compact cluster in the trees of M and N proteins ( Fig. 5 and 6 ). These topological anomalies indicate that recombination may have contributed to the evolution of group 1 viruses, and this aspect is worth further analysis that is beyond the scope of this paper. Since our findings are limited to the same group 1, they do not undermine the classification of coronaviruses in three main groups. The trees for S (Fig. 3) , M (Fig. 5) , RdRp (Fig. 7) and HEL (Fig. 8 ) proteins were rooted using the torovirus homologs as outgroups. Several topologies are evident in these trees. The 1 st and 2 nd groups were clustered in the M and HEL trees, and the 1 st and 3 rd groups were clustered in the S tree, while no reliable intergroup clustering was observed in the RdRp tree. The possible causes of these variations remain unknown although they may purely be due to technical reasons (e.g. small sampling size and/or large distances between the outgroup and other sequences). In this respect, the root position in the S protein tree may be the least reliable due to the most pronounce divergence of the respective torovirus sequence. However, these unresolved complexities do not compromise the group structure of coronaviruses. Fig. 9 . Frequency distributions of pairwise identity percentages of two replicase domains in the Nidovirales. Amino acid sequences of putative RdRp (A) and the HEL (B) domains were retrieved from databases and aligned with CLUSTAL X and T-COFFEE to generate pairwise score matrices including percentages of identical residues in each pair of sequences. These matrices were processed to plot frequency distributions of percentage scores that were rounded with the step of 2%. Three groups of scores were colored and they correspond to comparisons: (i) between coronaviruses from different groups (black), (ii) between nidoviruses from different families (light gray), and (iii) between coronaviruses and toroviruses (dark gray). A frequency distribution of pairwise scores between random sequences (white) was also plotted",

Do these groups belong to the same genus or are they prototypes for separate genera? The current guidelines for virus taxonomy do not provide firm quantitative sequence criteria, but rather leave it to each taxonomy study group to design and validate ranks for a family for which it is responsible [79] . As a result, intra-and interrank pairwise sequence conservation varies tremendously among different virus families. For instance, the interfamily conservation among RdRps of viruses of the genus Sobemovirus and a Luteoviridae genus is around 45% identical residues, and RdRps of the Comoviridae family share 37%, 26% and 24% pairwise identity with homologs of the Sequiviridae, Picornaviridae and Caliciviridae families, respectively. In contrast, significantly lower numbers characterize the intergenera RdRp conservation in the Togaviridae and Flaviviridae [88] (A. Gorbalenya, unpublished observation). These figures are correlated with other characteristics including genome organization and expression. To revise Coronaviridae taxonomy, we decided to follow defacto criteria that discriminate ranks in several complex virus families related to the Picornaviridae with which nidoviruses showed distant affinity [26] . Inspection of the intergroup pairwise scores obtained for the four structural proteins typical for coronaviruses show that the low end of these numbers (from 9 to 23%) is in a twilight zone occupied by highly diverged proteins [19] . Accordingly, no homologs of the N and E proteins have been found outside coronaviruses, and the only (very) distant homologs of S and M proteins are encoded by toroviruses (see below). In another test, we compared the pairwise scores obtained for structural proteins of coronaviruses and viruses of other densely populated families. It was revealed that the obtained inter-group pairwise scores for coronaviruses are similar to those calculated for the coat proteins of different genera of the Potyviridae family that have from 18 to 31% identical residues [65] . Accordingly, the coronavirus intra-group pairwise scores were closer to the intragenera figures, which, for instance, show that amino acid identity in structural proteins of the Picornaviridae exceeds 50% [39] .",

Although it is tempting to believe that the above characteristics are indeed group-specific, analysis of a more diverse set of coronavirus genomes will be essential to verify this perception.

There are two possible ranks to consider -subfamily or family. The subfamily rank is used in a few virus families and one order [48, 80] . To justify its usage in the Coronaviridae, the toroviruses and coronaviruses must share (significantly) more characters in common than each of them has with the other two Nidovirales families. Analysis of virion architecture of nidoviruses revealed different nucleocapsid organizations in four major lineages with toroviruses having toroidal and coronaviruses having icosahedral internal virion structures [23, 24, 72] . These specifics are correlated with the lack of homologs of essential or semi-essential coronavirus N and E genes [43, 51] in toroviruses [72] . In contrast and unlike arteriviruses and roniviruses, toroviruses do have homologs of S and M proteins of coronaviruses that are encoded in the same (gene) order [70, 71] . Protein conservation is very weak and includes a previously recognized region in the M protein [18] . Accordingly, virions of coronaviruses and toroviruses slightly resemble each other (Figs. 13A and B) and differ from those of arteriviruses and roniviruses ( Fig. 13C and D) . The most characteristic feature common for virions of coronaviruses and toroviruses is the presence of the large peplomers that are formed by trimers of the S protein protruding from virion envelope (Figs. 13 A and B). Toroviruses also have homologs of the non-essential genes 2 and HE unique to the group 2 coronaviruses, where they are encoded between the replicase and S genes [12] . In toroviruses, these genes are located in other non-adjacent positions; an nsp2 homolog is encoded immediately upstream of the replicase frameshift as part of the replicase and an HE homolog maps between genes M and N (Fig. 12 A and B) [69] . In the equine torovirus the HE gene is partially truncated [12] .",

Corona-and toroviruses, compared to roni-and arteriviruses, showed the longest collinearity in the replicase 1b region, as reported elsewhere Gl, large glycoprotein [13, 16, 26] . For instance, arteriviruses seem to encode an unrelated protein to the putative methyltransferase domain, which is released from the C-terminus of replicase and may lack a homolog of the putative exonuclease domain, which is conserved between HEL and the nidovirus-specific domain in corona-and toroviruses [26] (Snijder, Bredenbeek, Dobbe, Thiel, Ziebuhr, Poon, Guan, Rozanov, Spaan and Gorbalenya, submitted). This comparative analysis cannot currently be extended further to the N-terminus to include the 1a part of replicase, as the corresponding torovirus sequence is not in the public domain. This region, which includes more than 4000 amino acid residues in coronaviruses and roniviruses, is extremely poorly conserved among established families [13, 18, 26, 68, 89] . Future nidovirus-wide analysis of this region may be highly informative for taxonomic purposes.",

In contrast, in other analyses of the RdRp domain the expected clustering of coronaviruses and toroviruses was observed [13, 30] . The latter datasets included outgroup sequence(s), although the exact reasons of the observed striking variations of the tree topology may be more complex. Particularly, very large distances between four major lineages of the nidoviruses and significant under-representation of toroand ronivirus sequences may have negatively affected the reliability of alignments and phylogenetic inference in our analyses. We believe therefore that the nidovirus phylogeny must be verified later when the number and diversity of torovirus and ronivirus sequences will match those of arteriviruses and coronaviruses.",

Indeed, compared to the 22-25% amino acid residue identity between RdRps of coronaviruses and toroviruses, the RdRp conservation among a number of viruses that belong to other families is (substantially) higher (see above). Likewise, toro-and coronaviruses do not group together in respect to the transcription mechanism to express 3 -located open reading frames. For this purpose coronaviruses (and equally arteriviruses) employ discontinuous transcription of the genomic RNA [44, 61, 78] , while toroviruses appear to rely upon both discontinuous and continuous transcriptions [81] . In this respect, roniviruses differ further as their sgRNAs may be produced exclusively through continuous transcription [14] .",

This list of common properties may well be extended in future when more sequences become available and characterization of these viruses advances. However, until criteria differentiating the family and subfamily ranks for viruses in general are clearly formulated, it remains a matter of personal preference to choose which characteristics -the numerous common or the few unique ones -should weigh more for revising the taxonomy of coronaviruses and toroviruses. Either of two possible decisions -to assign the family or subfamily rank to coronaviruses and toroviruses -seems to be compatible with the current guidelines of the ICTV and either of them may not satisfy everybody in the field.",
