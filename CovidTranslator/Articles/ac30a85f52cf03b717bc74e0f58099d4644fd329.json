PRCV exposure induced partial protection against TGEV challenge in suckling pigs based upon a decreased number of diarrhea cases (42% vs. 90% in age-matched control pigs), limited virus shedding in feces, and increases in virusneutralizing serum antibody titers; in contrast, all 11-day-old pigs inoculated with TGEV were completely protected after challenge. Weaned pigs were also studied to eliminate any possibility that lactogenic immunity from contact PRCV-exposed sows kontributed to protection against TGEV. Once weaned, none of the PRCV-exposed or age-matched control pigs had diarrhea after TGEV challenge; moreover, both groups exhibited less recta1 virus shedding than suckling pigs. Vigorous lymphocyte proliferative responses ( > 96 000 counts per minute (cpm) ) were detected in mononuclear cells prepared from mesenteric (MLN) and bronchial (BLN) lymph nodes of TGEV-primed pigs. Analyses of these responses indicate that virus-specific cell-mediated immune responses correlated with protection against rectal and nasal virus shedding after TGEV challenge.

TGEV infects and destroys villous enterocytes of the small intestine leading to vomiting, severe malabsorptive diarrhea, dehydration, and mortality approaching 100% in newborn susceptible pigs (Saif and Wesley, 1992) . Because effective vaccines and therapy are unavailable, the disease continues to negatively impact the swine industry. Infection of pigs with virulent TGEV elicits protective active immunity subsequent to enteric replication of the virus, stimulation of inductive sites in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), and production of virus-specific cell-mediated immunity, antibody-secreting cells ( ASC), and intestinal secretory IgA (Saif and Wesley, 1992; VanCott et al., 1993; Brim et al., 1994) . Protective lactogenic immunity conferred to pigs suckling sows that were immunized via natural exposure or oral inoculation with virulent TGEV is theorized to result from the migration of TGEV-specific IgA-committed B cells from GALT to the mammary glands where they mature into IgA-ASC and produce secretory IgA to TGEV in milk (Saif and Wesley, 1992) . TGEV infects the respiratory tract (Kemeny et al., 1975; Furuuchi et al., 1979; O'Toole et al., 1989) and stimulates virus-specific cellular and ASC immune responses in bronchial lymph nodes (BLN) (VanCott et al., 1993; Brim et al., 1994) ; however, the contribution of respiratory lymphoid tissue to protective immunity against TGEV is unclear.",

Conventional serologic tests are unable to distinguish between PRCV and TGEV, although antigenic differentiation is possible with specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in a serum blocking ELISA (Callebaut et al., 1988; Garwes et al., 1988; Van Nieuwstadt and Boonstra, 1992; Simkins et al., 1992) . PRCV replicates extensively in the respiratory tract, but intestinal PRCV replication is timited to a few villous subepithelial cells (Pensaert et al., 1986; Cox et al., 1990) . The mechanisms by which PRCV exposure induces a variable degree of active (Van Nieuwstadt et al., 1989; Wesley and Woods, 1992; Cox et al., 1993) and passive immunity (Bernard et al., 1989; Paton and Brown, 1990; De Diego et al., 1992) to TGEV infection are unclear. A bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) -mammary immunologic link has been proposed to account for the appearance of TGEV-neutralizing secretory IgA in milk from PRCV-exposed sows (Callebaut et al., 1990) . Our recent studies with PRCV-inoculated pigs demonstrated vigorous virus-specific cell-mediated and ASC, primarily IgG, immune responses in BLN, but little stimulation of mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) (VanCott et al., 1993; Brim et al., 1994) .",

One-fifth of the total inoculum dose was administered via the intranasal route. Twenty-three age-matched uninoculated pigs from three litters served as controls. Each litter was housed in a separate isolation room during the experiments; each pig in these eight litters remained with its sow until euthanasia. On Postinoculation Day (PID) 24, 35day-old pigs from all three groups (TGEV, PRCV, and control) were given an oronasal challenge dose of virulent TGEV ( 1.3 X 10' PFU per pig). The rationale for the virus doses given to these pigs was detailed elsewhere . Animals were observed for clinical signs of gastroenteritis and respiratory infection, i.e. vomiting, diarrhea, nasal discharge, coughing, and dyspnea. Nasal and rectal swab specimens were collected from each pig before virus inoculation and challenge, then daily for 8 PID and 8 postchallenge days (PCD). Blood samples were drawn from selected pigs at the time of inoculation and challenge, on various PID and PCD, and from all pigs following euthanasia. Pigs were euthanized on PCD 0 (PID 24), 2, 4, 8, and 12. MLN, BLN, spleens, and segments of the small intestine were harvested for cell preparations that were tested in lymphocyte proliferation assays and flow cytometric analysis (FCM) . Tissues from eight TGEV-seronegative, unexposed suckling pigs from the same herd were also available for FCM. An additional ten pigs from one litter were inoculated with PRCV as above, then weaned at 3 weeks of age (PID 10). One litter of six age-matched weaned pigs served as controls. Both litters of weaned pigs were challenged with TGEV when 35 days old (PID 24); pigs were euthanized on PCD 0,4, and 12.",

Less than half of our challenged suckling pigs developed diarrhea compared with 90% of the challenged control pigs. Positive virusspecific MLN proliferative responses at PCD 2 were coincident with the onset of primary TGEV-specific MLN proliferation in cells from control pigs; responses from PRCV-exposed suckling and weaned pigs peaked at PCD 4 and by PCD 12 were significantly lower than those in MLN from control and TGEV-reinoculated pigs (Fig. 5) . Hence, PRCV exposure did not enhance the duration of TGEV-specific lymphocyte proliferation in MLN from challenged pigs, but the magnitude of the MLN response at PCD 4 was two-to three-fold greater than that observed in MLN from TGEV-challenged control pigs. Our investigation of TGEV-specific B cell responses from these same pigs disclosed that numbers of virusspecific IgA-and IgG-ASC in MLN were greatest at PCD 12 and did not differ significantly among the three groups of suckling pigs at this time point, although significant differences were observed at PCD 0, 2, and 4 . These data suggest that, despite the lack of persistent TGEV-specific lymphocyte proliferative responses in MLN of PRCVexposed pigs, T cell help afforded to B cells was sufficient to allow virus-specific IgA-and IgG-ASC responses in these pigs to eventually approach the ASC numbers in MLN of TGEV-reinoculated and TGEV-challenged control pigs. Virus-specific BLN cell proliferative responses were high before challenge of PRCV-exposed pigs, and their continuation after challenge correlated with complete protection against virus shedding in nasal secretions from all pigs in both suckling and weaned PRCV groups.",

Positive TGEV-specific proliferation was noted in MLN and BLN of suckling control pigs at PCD 2, whereas significant responses in spleens were not measured until PCD 8. The decreased magnitude and delayed onset of virusspecific spleen cell proliferation in control pigs may reflect the fact that TGEV is not a systemic infection and is rarely isolated from the spleens of infected pigs (Furuuchi et al., 1978 (Furuuchi et al., / 1979 , and the relocation of antigen-specific T helper cells is mucosally restricted after gut immunization (Dunkley and Husband, 1987) .

            "text": "A comparison of rectal virus shedding from suckling pigs detected by CCIF and IEM provides indirect evidence that intestinal virus-specific antibody might contribute to the partial protection observed in PRCV-inoculated pigs. Virus detection by CCIF may have been hampered by the decreased infectivity of antibody-coated virions, whereas positive IEM only requires the visualization of virus particles. Rectal swab samples from TGEVchallenged control pigs tested by both methods gave about the same percentage of positive pigs (71-78%), implying minimal interference by intestinal antibody. In contrast, the TGEV-reinoculated pigs that were probably secreting high levels of intestinal secretory IgA (Saif and Wesley, 1992) had one positive sample of five tested by IEM and none positive by CCIF. Only one PRCV-inoculated pig had virus detected by CCIF versus 83% of the pigs were positive by IEM. In our B cell study, we described low numbers of virus-specific IgA-ASC in the small intestine lamina propria after PRCV inoculation; however, in PRCVexposed pigs after TGEV challenge, we observed rapid, dramatic increases in virus-specific IgG-ASC in the gut lamina propria . Moreover, Cox et al. ( 1993) detected TGEV-specific IgA in feces of PRCV-inoculated pigs following TGEV challenge. The rapid induction of these secondary antibody responses might curtail TGEV replication and may also interfer with virus detection in assays such as CCIF. The second source of intestinal antibody is passive lactogenic immunity conferred to pigs suckling sows that were contact-exposed to TGEV or PRCV. Other reports have shown that PRCV exposure of sows stimulates the production of TGEV-neutralizing IgA in milk (Callebaut et al., 1990 ) and provides partial protection against TGEV challenge in suckling pigs (Bernard et al., 1989; Paton and Brown, 1990; De Diego et al., 1992) .",

We did not exclude Peyer's patches from the pieces of ileum subjected to collagenase treatment and would expect them to be part of the lamina propria cell preparation.

In contrast to humans and mice, blood from young pigs and ruminants contains a relatively high number of thymus-derived null T cells (CD2_CD4_CD88sIg-), many of which express the yS T cell receptor (TcR) (Hit-t et al., 1990; Hein and Mackay, 1991; Binns et al., 1992) . The y8 TcR+ cells are thought to provide non-MHC-restricted T cell immunity against infections of epithelial surfaces, including the gut mucosa. In swine, a subset of ~8 TcR+ cells has been identified as CD2+CD4_CDS-T cells that selectively accumulate in spleens and MLN, but are rarely found among circulating lymphocytes (Saalmuller et al., 1989 (Saalmuller et al., , 1990 . A high proportion of T cells from the jejunal and ileal lamina propria of land 5day-old, but not 12-and 40-day-old, pigs were the CD2+CD4_CD8-subset (Rothkotter et al., 1991) . However, our results suggest the presence of CD2+CD4_CD8-T cells in the lamina propria of both unexposed and TGEV-challenged pigs from 11 to 5 1 days of age.

Lymphocytes from the lamina propria probably included significant numbers of y6 TcR+ T cells and memory T cells that had encountered TGEV or PRCV after primary inoculation and migrated back to the lamina propria to exert their effector function; these cell populations may exhibit weak or no proliferative responses to antigenic restimulation (memory T cells) and depressed responses to T cell mitogens (~8 TcR+ T cells). Many questions regarding the composition and function of the porcine lamina propria remain to be answered. The magnitude of virusspecific lymphocyte proliferation in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MLN and BLN) was directly attributable to TGEV or PRCV replication that occurred in the adjacent mucosa, whereas lymphocyte proliferation in a systemic lymphoid tissue (spleen) depended on the relocalization of virus or virus-sensitized lymphocytes from the mucosa. Limited intestinal replication of TGEV and enteric disease in PRCV-exposed pigs challenged with TGEV may result from any or all of the following mechanisms: ( 1) active B and T cell immunity confirmed by virus-specific IgG-and IgA-ASC in GALT and lymphocyte proliferative responses in MLN; (2) passive lactogenic immunity conferred on suckling pigs from contact-exposure of sows; (3) accelerated maturation of the gut with subsequent increased resistance to TGEV infection in weaned pigs. Substantial virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation in BLN or MLN before challenge correlated with complete protection from shedding TGEV after challenge in nasal secretions or feces, respectively. These results confirm that PRCV infection primes TGEV-specific cell-mediated immune responses and, thus, contributes to partial immunity against TGEV challenge.",

Cells were immunostained for the swine cell surface markers CD2 (A), CD4 ( B ) , and CD8 (C) Data are expressed as the mean percentage positive cells after subtraction of background staining with anti-Ig-FITC ( f SEM). *Data not available.",
