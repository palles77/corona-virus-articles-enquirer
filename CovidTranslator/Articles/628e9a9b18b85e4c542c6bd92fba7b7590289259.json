Those who are most vulnerable during and in the immediate aftermath of disaster crises are the elderly. Therefore, it is imperative to identify them and determine their specific needs in order to support them. Although several Social Vulnerability Indexes (SVIs) have been developed to assess different types of disaster vulnerability across geographic and population levels, few have been tailored to the older population. Building on the research of Gusmano et al., this study modifies and uses an SVI specifically designed to assess the vulnerability of older populations to emergencies and disasters across seven domains, namely, population size, institutionalization, poverty, living alone, disability, communication obstacles, and access to primary care. Moreover, it is acknowledged that availability of data largely depends on the local context and is always a barrier to production of indices across countries. The present study offers suggestions on how modifications can be made for local adaptation such that the SVI can be applied in different cities and localities. The SVI used in this study provides information to stakeholders in emergency preparedness, not only about natural disasters but also about health hazards and emergencies, which few existing SVI address.",

Types of disasters range from natural disasters, such as earthquakes and typhoons, to public health atrocities, e.g., pandemics of infectious disease, and terrorist attacks. Recent examples of natural disasters that have resulted in tremendous damages and harm to residents include the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami that shook the east coast of Japan, including Tokyo, resulting in tragic losses of life; the super typhoon Sandy, which hit New York in 2012 with serious power outages and flooding; and the 2013 New South Wales heat wave, triggering bushfires that destroyed residential homes in Sydney and Melbourne. Substantial damage and loss of life result also from human-induced disasters, e.g., the 1996 Garley Building fire in Hong Kong took 41 lives. Apart from physical hazards, public health disasters of epidemics and pandemics have been increasing and affect predominantly urban populations. 1 Recent examples include the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong that caused clustered deaths in one of the private residential estates and the influenza epidemic that caused a public health emergency in New York. Many world cities, despite their affluence and well-developed infrastructure and service networks, lacked adequate emergency preparedness plans for such disasters.",

[2] [3] [4] A recent study showed that the disproportionately high death toll in the older population in Hurricane Katrina may be related to the unsuccessful evacuation plan and the interruption of clinical services, auxiliary services, and pharmaceutical services after the disaster. 5 Many questions need to be addressed in order to create emergency plans to avert adverse outcomes. For example, if an area has to be quarantined during a pandemic outbreak, are older people provided simple and clear instructions to facilitate their understanding of what they need to do? Will they be able to perform daily activities, such as bathing or toileting, if there is no customary home helper? Do they have enough medication for the prolonged quarantined period? Are prescription records available from a centralized database if prescriptions are lost or destroyed in the disaster, such as what occurred to older people following the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami? Is their anxiety treated well? Anxiety during the SARS outbreak was associated with higher suicide rates among older people. 6 These findings show that older people, compared with younger populations, have additional physiological, psychological, and social needs in times of disaster. Therefore, vulnerability of older people should be examined separately from the general population.",

            "text": "Older people show different patterns of vulnerability compared with younger people in terms of their sociodemographical, financial, social, physical, and psychological characteristics. 11 Furthermore, older people are more likely to suffer health-related consequences and take more time to recover from disasters. 2, 12 Most SVIs include the number or percentage of older people as one of the variables. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Since the older population is a heterogeneous subgroup with different levels of vulnerability, there is a need to go beyond merely describing this group by its population size and more deeply examine the characteristics of this high-risk subgroup. Despite the rapidly aging population, the ratio of the older population to the whole population still constitutes a minority. Thus, using population demographics to construct the SVI is likely to mask the characteristics of the older population. However, most of the SVIs were developed for general populations with only a few applicable for older people specifically. [19] [20] [21] The few SVIs that include the elderly were developed for different target populations. The SVI developed by Crooks was targeted for developing countries, 19 while the one developed by Gusmano et al. was aimed at world cities with well-established infrastructures and economies. 21 In addition, while most of the existing SVI studies focused on natural disasters, 20 Gusmano et al. incorporated vulnerability to health disasters such as pandemics. 21 Although a generic SVI may guide the establishment of social service organizations to support the general population, an index specific to older populations is needed to inform the provision of community-based disaster preparation services for the older people. An SVI developed specifically for older people is an important assessment tool for informing management policies and measures for dealing with disasters and emergencies that meet the needs of the elderly. In order to protect cities with an ever-increasing aging population and to meet the emergency service needs of older people in natural and health disasters, the current study aims to build on the SVI for older people based on the previous work of Gusmano et al. 21 and apply it to the examination of two cities-Hong Kong and New York City as examples. This modified SVI could be applied to different cities and regions.",

The present study modifies their work by adding the institutionalization domain. Moreover, it is acknowledged that availability of data is always a barrier to production of indices across countries. The present study offers suggestions for creating more flexible modifications, adaptable to local contexts. For example, if data for people aged 75 years or more were not available, those aged 65 years or older could be considered. Also, according to contextual differences in cities, an alternate domain-specific variable may be used. For example, education level was used in homogeneous populations and linguistic isolation in heterogeneous populations. The rationale for the vulnerability domains used in the current investigation is described in the following sections.",

            "text": "Advanced age is related to physical and cognitive decline, mobility problems, chronic disease morbidity, and mortality, 11 which may limit mobility and accessibility to resources related to emergency preparedness and recovery. 20, 25 Apart from inability to evacuate, some may be unwilling to leave their homes. 26 The older population size domain is measured by the number of people aged \u226575 in the geographical unit. 21 The greater the size of the older population, the larger the SVI. Unlike the other characteristics, which are usually expressed in terms of proportion, this variable is expressed in absolute numbers so as to capture the actual number of people who need help and support in disaster emergency situations. Some studies included the number of older people in the compilation of SVI, using different definitions by chronological age. 10, [14] [15] [16] 20 The present study adopts age \u226575 as the definition, since previous research showed that this age group had greater needs for evacuation assistance than the young-olds, 27 and there was a sharp increase in health problems among this group in the aftermath of disasters. 3 Institutionalization Hospital patients and institutional care residents are more likely to be frail, disabled, or bedbound. Though residential institutions have stricter building codes than those of domestic households, they may be understaffed and/or lack special vehicles to evacuate the residents in a timely manner during emergencies. 24, 28 For example, during Hurricane Katrina, nursing home administrators had to make challenging evacuation decisions, arrange transportation, and seek appropriate receiving facilities for older residents. 29 Locating the areas with higher concentrations of care facilities helps to pinpoint areas of highest specialist evacuation need. 14 A modification of the SVI of Gusmano et al. is to incorporate the institutionalization domain, which is measured by the percentage of institutional population (dividing the number of older people living in institutions by the number of older people living in both community dwellings and institutions) in the geographical unit. The higher the percentage of institutional population, the larger the SVI. Other studies have adopted similar indicators. 14, 17, 20, 30 The characteristics of the institutionalized population were not included in the development of the SVI because their vulnerability was more related to the institutional settings than their personal characteristics. 3 Living Alone Living alone elevates the risk of social isolation, which may, in turn, be associated with poorer mental and physical health, and leads to problems in escape and recovery from emergency situations. 31 Risk factors associated with living alone may be further exacerbated by other factors like widowhood or financial difficulties, which may further limit one's ability to access resources. 24, 25 This domain is measured by the percentage of community-dwelling older population living alone in the geographic unit. 21 The higher the percentage of older people living alone, the larger the SVI. This domain was also included in other studies. 19, 20, 30 Poverty Poverty limits the older person's ability to acquire resources necessary to maintain their well-being. For example, impoverished older people may not be able to afford fuel, food, or clothing to keep them warm in extremely cold weather 32 or may have limited access to services and resources for post-disaster rehabilitation, including accommodation, clothing, or transportation. 33 Even worse, older people living in poverty tend to cluster in disaster-prone areas. 34 During Hurricane Katrina, households living in poverty suffered disproportionately higher human and housing damages due to residing in low-quality constructions, and they were more likely to be forced to migrate following the disaster. 35 The poverty domain is measured by the percentage of community-dwelling older people with income below the values specified in the 2005 US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Poverty Guidelines, 36 which takes into account both the household size and the household income. 21 The higher the percentage of older people in poverty, the larger the SVI. The poverty domain was commonly included in other SVI studies. 10, 14, 17, 20, 35, 37 Communication Obstacles Effective communication is essential in disaster preparedness and management. For ethnically heterogeneous cities like New York City, those with limited English proficiency may face difficulties in disaster communication, which contain important information about the emergency preparations and recovery plans. 17, 25 Furthermore, those who were linguistically isolated were less likely to receive adequate health and social services, resulting in poorer health outcomes. 21, 38, 39 For ethnically homogeneous cities, such as Hong Kong, language isolation may not be a problem, but illiteracy and low educational attainment may be obstacles. Education level may reflect older individuals' knowledge and use of precautionary measures and emergency help lines. People with lower educational attainment tended to have limited access and response to disaster communications and had difficulties in managing and recovering from disasters. 40, 41 The higher the percentage of communication obstacles among the older people, the larger the SVI. For ethnically heterogeneous populations, such as New York City, the communication obstacle domain could be measured by the proportion of community-dwelling older population who are linguistically isolated (as defined by living in a household in which all members aged \u226514 years speak a non-English language or speak English less than \"very well\"). 21 Similar variables have been adopted in other SVI studies. 17, 37 A suggested modification of the SVI of Gusmano et al. for ethnically homogeneous populations, such as that of Hong Kong, is to measure this domain by the proportion of community-dwelling older population who have education levels less than lower secondary (Grade 9). Some SVI measures include this variable. 17, 19, 30 In New York City, the use of linguistically isolated in this domain is preferred to education level since many residents are immigrants. Although immigrants may have attained high education levels in their home countries, this may not be accompanied by English language fluency. In contrast, immigrants in Hong Kong are mainly from the southern part of China, where differences in spoken language are minor. Therefore, linguistic isolation is less of a problem in Hong Kong.",

The diagnoses for hospital admission were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, which was used to identify the AHCs. 49 AHC rates were adjusted using the WHO's age standardization method. 55 Although only district-level disability statistics and AHC rates were available to the authors, the CA-level statistics were assumed to be the same as those of the district-level. Underestimates of disability may exist owing to non-mandatory registration. AHC rates also may be underestimated since the rate was based on the hospital admissions to public hospitals, which accounted for 90-95 % of all inpatients. 56 It was assumed that the missing data was independent of geographic units.",

The vulnerability was not only taken account of natural disasters but also the health hazards and emergencies. Findings of this study inform the stakeholders involving in emergency preparedness actions of the residential areas of the most vulnerable older population and revealed their needs. The importance of local adaptation was also demonstrated with applications to Hong Kong and New York City. For example, linguistic isolation was found to be an important concern for a culturally diverse city like New York City, but education level was more relevant to a homogeneous city like Hong Kong. The Hong Kong findings were consistent with the authors' expectations that CAs in Sham Shui Po, Yau Tsim Mong, and Wong Tai Sin are the most vulnerable, since these districts are well-known, old residential districts, with lower socioeconomic status and poorer health outcomes. The surprising results were the high vulnerability in CAs in the Southern District, which, despite a relatively high socioeconomic status, has a high proportion of the older population with disabilities and a high AHC rate. This observation justified the inclusion of some health indicators in the SVI, which was not the case for many of the SVIs reported in previous research. The interactions of health-related variables with poverty, low education level, and singleton households reflect varying vulnerability in the older population.",

The Bronx and Brooklyn areas include neighborhoods that are among the poorest and most vulnerable in New York City. This data is consistent with previous studies that have found that older people who live in low-income neighborhoods in the Bronx and Brooklyn are more likely than older residents of other boroughs to report individual health problems and express concerns about their built and social environments. 21 It is important to update the SVI on a regular basis since the demographics and characteristics of the population are changing. Therefore, in this study, the statistics used for calculation of SVI were based on regularly available sources of official statistics, rather than from ad hoc surveys. These statistics are routinely collected, There are other factors that may affect the vulnerability of the older people. For example, the cluttered living environment or housings without escalator service may hinder the evacuation of older people from their own homes or institutions during emergencies or from seeking medical advice and care. However, these factors may not be quantified by regular official statistics, and they were excluded from the SVI. Moreover, the influence of some factors may change over time. For example, the low education level among the older people in Hong Kong may become irrelevant several decades from now because the future cohorts of older people may have benefited from the mandatory education policy implemented in the late 1970s. Meanwhile, with the rising number of new immigrants from South Asia and a variety of cities from China, who may not be proficient in Cantonese, Mandarin, or English, language isolation may be an emerging issue. Among the organizations that have developed recommendations and protocols for emergency planning for older people and people with disabilities are the Red Cross, Salvation Army, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Ready.gov, HelpAge International, the Administration on Aging, and the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP).

This study was limited by the unavailability of statistical analysis at the desired level (e.g., the Hong Kong CAs). While statistics for finer geographical units may not be available in the public domain, the government should be able make them available for researchers in order to compile the SVI more accurately. It would be helpful if public agencies captured more disaggregated residential information when collecting data for other purposes and if they did so in a consistent way. In New York City, for example, agencies working in different domains use completely different geographic units for data collection purposes. This makes it harder to develop an SVI or other indicators of health and social well-being that are multidimensional.
