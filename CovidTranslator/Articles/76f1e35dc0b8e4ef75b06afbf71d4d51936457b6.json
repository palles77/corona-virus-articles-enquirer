The purpose of this brief investigation was to determine whether nasopharyngeal specimens from patients infected with strains of influenza A (H1N1) carrying the H274Y mutation were more likely than not to contain other commonly circulating respiratory viral pathogens.",

Neuraminidase gene sequencing was undertaken and sequences were aligned using CLUSTALX. Isolate sequences were compared to sequences with described H274Y mutations: GenBank accession No. 7 Specimens corresponding to H274Y mutant and H274 wild-type isolates were blinded and chosen at random for a retrospective investigation for other respiratory viral pathogens (adenovirus, coronavirus 229E/NL63, coronavirus OC43, influenza A/B, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, respiratory syncytial virus A/B, rhinovirus A) using the Seeplex 1 RV detection kit protocol (Seegene, Inc., Rockville, MD). 8 Data analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).",

However, it should be noted that the interaction of influenza A and bacterial pathogens could not be determined in these specimens given issues of specimen collection and data collection. Given the lack of data supporting a co-infection model, it is considered that further work must be undertaken to determine the fitness and virulence of the H274Y mutant influenza A strains circulating currently.",
