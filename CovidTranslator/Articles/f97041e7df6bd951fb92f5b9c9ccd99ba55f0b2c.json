These recombinant fragments were designed as parts of two different structural proteins from SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). One recombinant polypeptide, S251-683, was designed as part of the spike glycoprotein, and the other three polypeptides comprised almost the whole nucleocapsid protein, avoiding the last 25 C-terminal amino acids. Immunization with a cocktail of these four polypeptides yielded a specific polyclonal antibody that is able to recognize SARS-CoV-infected cells by an immunofluorescence assay. This polypeptide cocktail was also used to set up an ELISA-based IgG-plus-IgM antibody detection test, which showed 99% specificity and 90% sensitivity upon evaluation using sera from 100 healthy negative controls and 20 SARS patients. Separate immunoreactivity assays with each recombinant polypeptide demonstrated that a combination of N and S protein fragments was more suitable than the individual peptides for developing a serological assay for SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "A new coronavirus (CoV) (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus) has been implicated as the causal agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (3, 20) . Its single-stranded plus-sense RNA genome of \u03f330 kb contains 23 putative open reading frames, including four major structural proteins that are common to all known CoVs: the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (12) . The control of an epidemic requires a rapid and accurate diagnostic technique that can promptly identify the infection and allow its treatment and the implementation of infection control measures, including the isolation of cases and the management of contacts to prevent further transmissions. The development of a sensitive and highly specific diagnostic kit that is effective at early stages of SARS is of great interest because of (i) the highly contagious and acute nature of the disease, (ii) the stress caused to individuals by unnecessary quarantines during an epidemic, and (iii) the absence of effective anti-SARS therapy. However, the level of virus excretion is comparatively low during the initial phase of SARS (15) ; therefore, early diagnosis requires a highly sensitive test that can detect the low levels of viral genome or viral proteins present during the first few days after SARS onset. Several molecular assays have been designed to provide an early diagnosis, based on the detection of specific RNA sequences by PCR. However, RNA extraction protocols are not straightforward and may produce RNA preparations that are not useful for reverse transcription if the protocols are not properly followed, yielding false-posi-tive results. A specific antibody or antigen detection test would be technologically simpler and less expensive. Thus, the objective of the present study was to develop an easy-to-use diagnostic assay by evaluating the use of combinations of recombinant proteins obtained from the SARS-associated CoV (SARS-CoV) in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based antibody detection test.",

The S protein, a projection of the viral surface, is the major neutralizing antigen of the known CoVs (2, 6, 10, 11, 18) . It plays an important role in the initial stages of infection, forming the characteristic corona of large, distinctive spikes in the viral envelope (20) . The N protein has been described by Krokhin et al. as the major immunogen in SARS-CoV (12) and is the most abundant protein throughout infection (13) . Previous studies have suggested that a combination of these two proteins in the same assay may be needed to confirm the specificity of presumptive SARS antibodies and to offer a sensitive serodiagnosis (8, 24) . For this reason, our study focused on the natural immune responses of SARS patients to a recombinant S-protein (S251-683) and N-protein (N1, N2, and N3) cocktail used as the antigen in an ELISA-based antibody detection test.",

Only 20 sera from clinically diagnosed SARS patients were available for these studies. Assays performed with the combination of all four recombinant polypeptides, using sera from healthy donors with no exposure to SARS-CoV as controls, showed a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 99%. One possible explanation for the two false-negative results may be that some essential linear antigenic sites are located outside the selected spike protein fragment, since polypeptide S251-683 covers less than one-third of the S protein sequence. Furthermore, the immunogenicity of the recombinant S protein in SARS-CoV may be lower than that of its native counterpart due to effects of the expression system used to overproduce the recombinant polypeptide, with the possible loss of essential conformationand/or glycosylation-dependent epitopes. The N protein is reported to be free of glycosylation sites and does not appear to change its immunological characteristics, even when expressed in a prokaryotic system (17) . Nevertheless, the heavy glycosylation of the spike protein with mannose and/or hybrid oligosaccharides (7) may make it a suitable candidate for use in a eukaryotic rather than a bacterial system. However, the separate analysis of each polypeptide with six SARS-CoV-positive serum samples showed that the S251-683 fragment (reactive with three of six sera) was less immunogenic than the nucleocapsid protein (reactive with five of six sera due to the additive results of the three fragments). However, the spike protein fragment reacted with one serum sample (sample 3) that did not react with the N antigen. Similar findings have been published by Woo et al. (24) and Yu et al. (25) , who concluded that a recombinant N-based IgG ELISA was more sensitive than a recombinant S-based IgG ELISA for the serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV. ELISAs with polypeptides obtained from the nucleocapsid protein showed that N2 was the most immunogenic region. It should be taken into account that these studies used only six positive serum samples; therefore, these results should be confirmed with a more representative number of SARS-CoV-positive sera. a \u03e9 and \u03ea, results above and below the cutoff, respectively. b Negative controls comprised 86 serum samples from healthy blood donors, of which 1 gave a false-positive result, and 14 SARS-CoV-negative sera from individuals infected with non-SARS-related respiratory viruses, antinuclear antibodies, or rheumatoid factor, which were used for cross-reaction experiments.",

Western blot analysis was performed with the rabbit polyclonal serum in order to determine the presence of epitopes in the four SARS-CoV recombinant polypeptides obtained. The gel was loaded with 0.25 g of each protein, and a 1:500 dilution of the polyclonal antibody was used. The recombinant polypeptides were loaded as follows: lane 1, S251-683; lane 2, N1; lane 3, N2; lane 4, N3. FIG. 3. Immunofluorescence of Vero-E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV as determined using the polyclonal antibody. Photographs show SARS-CoV-infected cells (A) and noninfected cells (B) incubated with the polyclonal serum obtained by immunization with a mixture of the four recombinant proteins. Apple-green fluorescence marks the binding sites of the rabbit antibodies; the red color corresponds to Evans blue, used as a counterstain to prevent nonspecific reactions.",
