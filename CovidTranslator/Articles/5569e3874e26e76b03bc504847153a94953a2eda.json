The inhaled route of administration is chosen to be effective for delivering different types of preventer and reliever drugs to patients with airway obstructions owning the unique advantage of delivering relatively small doses of drug directly to the respiratory tract airways for achieving a high local concentration and diminishing systemic adverse effects; besides they may provide considerable cost savings because of the lower dosage regimens, especially with expensive therapeutic agents. Consequently, this results in a high therapeutic ratio as compared with other systemic drug delivery either through oral or parenteral route of administration (Borghardt et al., 2018) . Numerous and countless studies have shown that the lungs provide substantially superior bioavailability (BA) for macromolecules than any other route of drug delivery to the systemic circulation (Paranjpe and M\u00fc ller-Goymann, 2014; Javadzadeh and Yaqoubi, 2017) .",

This was achieved by developing a pharmaceutical dosage form known as the aerosols that was able to do that. Aerosols dosage forms are designed to be sprayed into the mouth which causes their contents to expel from the container directly into the lungs so as to deposit there and employ their anticipated action. Aerosols contain the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in combination with additional excipients in the form of fine mist. To form the final dosage, the ingredients are packaged with the aid of pressure to form a pressurized dispenser called the aerosol container. The excipients and therefore the components of the aerosol container along with plenty of other factors are accountable for the aerosols dosage form to indicate optimum function. Thus various quality control tests are performed to these dosage forms to guarantee that the ultimate product is at its optimum performance with the highest safety and that they fulfill product specifications which are going to be discussed in details throughout this chapter (Sahab et al., 2016) .",

The term \"aerosols\" now refers to pressurized packed products that contain the active ingredient(s) and excipients that are dispersed in a liquefied or compressed gas known as the propellant. It is by the power of this propellant that the contents of the aerosols are expelled from their container (USP-NF, 2015) . Aerosols dosage forms can be topically, orally, nasally, and systemically inhaled. By incorporating many different APIs into them, aerosols can be used for the treatment of a wide range of diseases, from acne to asthma and lung infections (Ashurst et al., 2000) . For example, salbutamol and metaproterenol sulfate are administered by the means of inhalation aerosols for relieving asthma symptoms (Labiris and Dolovich, 2003) .

In the meanwhile, as the inhalation flow rate is increased, the deposition of the drug in the oropharynx and large central airways by impaction will be greater. Lastly, to achieve adequate drug particles' deposition by the mechanism of gravitational particles sedimentation in the more peripheral parts of the lung, the breath-holding time is a critical factor. The prediction of aerosols properties, especially the aerodynamic diameters, is of significant importance when it comes to deposition of drug particles to the lungs itself. It is more reliable for the particles of 2 \u00b5m and larger in diameter to get deposited in the oropharynx and large conducting airways. The particle sizes of a pharmaceutical aerosol formulation are heterodisperse, meaning that they composed of various sizes, 50% of the aerosol elements by mass are smaller than the mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and the other 50% the particles is larger than the MMAD. The ideal size of the pharmaceutical aerosol particles is not yet well-defined, but, generally, it is known that in order for the inhaled particles to pass into the bronchial tree, the MMAD should not exceed 5 \u00b5m. The particle size of aerosols could be determined using measurement-related devices as cascade impactor or laser light scattering .",

Particles that are bigger in size than 5 \u00b5m are influenced by this deposition mechanism. The inertia of these large aerosol particles led to increasing resistance to change their direction when the flow of air into the respiratory tract changes its path suddenly, this will cause them to deviate away from streamline of air, causing them to impact and deposit on the walls of the airway. The energy of particles tends to keep them on their preestablished paths each time the air changes direction through the airways, which can lead to a high propensity to impact on airway surfaces. As a result, some of the particles near the airway surfaces will undergo deposition; this is termed inertial impaction. The possibility of deposition by impaction is subject to the ratio of particle arresting distance to dimensions of respiratory airways at an airstream's predicted velocity (Fern\u00e1ndez Tena and Casan Clar\u00e0, 2012) . This type deposition mechanism of particles is also reliant on the location of the particles within the airways. The highest prospect of deposition by impaction is in the trachea\u00c0bronchial respiratory zone, this means impaction is of foremost concern in the large respiratory airways. For example, in a bifurcation of the human bronchial tree, deposition possibility on inhalation is much higher for an element moving along the middle line of the parent tube than for elements moving nearer to the track walls, and the most likely deposition locations are at or near the carina of the bifurcation (edge of cartilage in the trachea occurs between two main bronchi divisions). The highest degree of deposition by impaction occurs at the throat, and to a lesser extent at other bifurcations (Koullapis et al., 2015) .",

The Stk number shows that the probability of a particle to deposit due to impaction is directly proportional to flow velocity, particle density, and diameter, whereas it is inversely proportional to the airway diameter (distance to the surface). Thus deposition by means of inertial impaction is most significant for larger particles moving at a high rate close to the surface. When the diameter of the particle approaches the same magnitude as the mean free path of air molecules, particles experience \"slip\" at their surface. This error becomes significant for elements that are less than 1 \u00b5m. The slip correction factor is inserted in the deposition equations to correct for this error. The greater the Stk, the greater the probability that the inhaled particles will get impacted and not follow their streamline of air and will get deposited on the airway walls by the inertial impaction mechanism (Nicolaou and Zaki, 2016) .",

This deposition results when the aerosol particles strike with the air molecules which results in the random motion of the aerosol particles inflicting their deposition within the areas of the airway wherever the velocity of air is low, such as the acinar region. Unlike the inertial impaction and the gravitational sediment-deposition mechanisms, increasing the particle size will reduce the deposition of particles by the Brownian diffusion; thus, in order to enhance the deposition of particles by this mechanism, the particle size should be reduced. The manner of deposition can be explained by the diffusion coefficient (D) of an aerosol particle which is given in the Stokes\u00c0Einstein equation (Eq. 12.3) (Fern\u00e1ndez Tena and Casan Clar\u00e0, 2012) .",

An image force is created by the electrically charged particles itself and is equal but opposite of its own charge.

Oversight of DF from the dose-rate calculation, as is often done, results in a considerable uncertainty of up to a factor of 10, as DF may vary from less than 0.1 to almost 1, mainly depending on particle size (ICRP, 2007) . If the aerodynamic diameter of an aerosol element is larger than 0.5 \u00b5m, the fractional deposition will increase with lowering the breathing frequency which in turn provides enough extra time to permit increasing gravity settling. For the particles that have an aerodynamic diameter larger than 1 \u00b5m, their deposition will increase once the average airflow rate rises up, and because of such type of particles, the inertial impaction deposition mechanism is affected that depends on velocity (Tu et al., 2013) .",

Increasing air flow rates raise the outcome effectiveness effect for the velocity-reliant particles deposition impaction mechanism while decreasing the effectiveness effect for time-reliant particles deposition diffusion and sedimentation mechanisms. Increasing tidal lung volumes permit particles to reach and distribute more in distal respiratory aeries, where the likely main particles deposition are governed by sedimentation and diffusion; therefore, the total input to overall deposition compared to deposition by impaction is increased. During exercise, both tidal volumes and breathing flow rates are increased, resulting in an increased deposition by sedimentation and diffusion in the small respiratory airways and alveoli; on the other hand, those conditions increase particles impaction in the large airways. Finally, mouth breathers will result in more particle deposition in respiratory tract than nose breathers because of the nasal efficient particles filtering compared to that of an oral route (Sankhal et al., 2013) .",

There is a great number of variations in total respiratory particles deposition among normal healthy subjects breathing in the same pattern because of inters subject variability. Even within the same individual, age and pathological processes along with the changes in dimensions and features of the tracheobronchial tree of the respiratory system with lung volume. Gender differences in anatomical respiratory system structure and modulators of lung function also cause variations in deposition between men and women. For example, deposition in the lung tracheobronchial tree is higher in women compared to that in men as the average female thorax dimension is smaller than that in men and lower conducting airways volume which is only around 75% that in men. So far, when these anatomical gender volume variances are shared with lesser resting minute ventilation volume (volume of gas inhaled or volume exhaled) and breathing flow rates pragmatic in women, total respiratory particles deposition is lesser in women than in men mainly for the reason that a smaller dispersion of the aerosol occurs in the alveolar distal region of the female lung. Respiratory airway breathing conditions and geometry develop from birth to maturity. These changes affect respiratory elements' deposition in childhood. According to studies on particle deposition among children, the respiratory particles deposition in children tend to be higher compared to that in adults by an average factor of 1.5, and because of their minor lung surface area than that of adults, the quantity of particles deposited per surface area is higher by a factor of 4 or 5 in children (Sankhal et al., 2013) .",

The significances of flash point determination is useful in determining correct conditions for storage, shipping, and to state safety regulations for flammable and combustible materials. In order to determine the flash point of an aerosol, two basic apparatus types are available which are an open cup and closed cup as shown in Fig. 12.6 . Closed cup tests purpose to simulate the situation of a fluid spill in a closed environmental condition. For any liquid of the test sample if it is at, or above, its flash point, a fire or explosion is a possibility once exposed to a possible ignition source. In closed cup tests to determine the flash point the investigated sample is placed inside a sealed test cup and introduced to a potential ignition source, determining the temperature at which the sample flashes. Open cup apparatus is used for the standard label (Lashkar, 2012) . Flash point test protocol is done by cooling the temperature of the aerosol product to almost 25 F, then the aerosol is captive to the testing apparatus. Gradually start to increase the temperature of the test liquid; the lowest temperature at which the vapor will ignite is recorded and this temperature is the flash point of the tested liquid. The obtained flash point is typically referring to the most flammable component's flash point (Parmar and Patel, 2017) . One of the points that should be known is that an open cup apparatus will constantly give a higher flash point than a closed cup one as the open cup permits loss of internal vapors to the atmosphere above the apparatus. Consequently, closed cup assessments are usually specified owing to improved precision (Felton, 2012) .",

By assaying these materials the amount of the active ingredient can be found. The other method used to evaluate the dosage emitted through a valve is by accurately weighting filled container. Several doses are then dispensed followed by reweighting the container each time, the average dose emitted through the valve can be found by dividing the difference in weight by the number of dispensed doses.

BA studies are related to estimating the rate and extent to which the API is absorbed systemically from a dosage form of a drug product and becomes available to exert its intended therapeutic effect at the targeted site of action. For certain drug dosage forms that are not proposed to be absorbed systemically, BA may be measured based on selected PK measurements to reflect the rate and extent to which API becomes available to employ its desired therapeutic effect at the intended site of action. For lung-delivered therapies, PK parameters assessment have a conventional title role in the quantification of drug delivery to the lungs and provides significant data about the respiratory-medicated aerosols BA, which is complementary to other supplementary techniques such as radiolabeled deposition (Borghardt et al., 2018) . BE productquality studies compare the characteristics of different pharmaceutical alternatives and is defined as \"the absence of a significant variance in the identity, potency, quality, rate and extent to which API reaches the site of drug action when administered at the equivalent molar dose under similar controlled conditions compared to pharmaceutical alternatives in a properly designed study.\" BE studies are important in developing and approval of generic and new drugs which compared as against clinical trial material to official reference listed drug. To establish BA and BE, in vitro and in vivo studies can be used, using in vivo [PK, pharmacodynamic (PD), or clinical], but in some cases, in vitro studies can be used alone (Chen et al., 2001) .",
