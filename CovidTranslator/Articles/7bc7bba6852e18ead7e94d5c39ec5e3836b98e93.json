Using the opposite hand (the one holding the medication), gently press down on the mandibular (lower) incisors to open the mouth further . Position the tablet or capsule onto the caudal aspect of the tongue as close to the larynx as possible. Quickly withdraw the hand and close the dog's mouth.

            "text": "The narrow lumen of tubes passed through the nostril of small dogs and cats limits the viscosity of solutions that can be administered through a tube directly into the gastrointestinal tract. Nasoesophageal intubation can be done with a variety of tube types and sizes . Newer polyurethane tubes, when coated with a lidocaine lubricating jelly, are nonirritating and may be left in place with the tip at the level of the distal esophagus. When placing the nasogastric tube, instill 4 to 5 drops of 0.5% proparacaine in the nostril of the cat or small dog; 0.5 to 1.0 mL of 2% lidocaine instilled into the nostril of a larger breed dog may be required to achieve the level of topical anesthesia needed to pass a tube through the nostril. With the head elevated, direct the tube dorsomedially toward the alar fold . After inserting the tip 1 to 2 cm into the nostril, continue to advance the tube until it reaches the desired length. If the turbinates obstruct the passage of the tube, withdraw the tube by a few centimeters. Then readvance the tube, taking care to direct the tube ventrally through the nasal cavity. Occasionally, it will be necessary to withdraw the tube completely from the nostril and repeat the procedure. In particularly small patients or 454 4 DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES patients with obstructive lesions (e.g., tumor) in the nasal cavity, it may not be possible to pass a tube. Do not force the tube against significant resistance through the nostril. CAUTION: The tip of the tube possibly can be introduced inadvertently through the glottis and into the trachea. Topical anesthetic instilled into the nose can anesthetize the arytenoid cartilages, thereby blocking a cough or gag reflex. I prefer to check the tube placement with a dry, empty syringe. Attach the test syringe to the end of the feeding tube. Rather than inject air or water in an attempt to auscultate borborygmus over the abdomen, attempt simply to aspirate air from the feeding tube. IF THERE IS NO RESISTANCE DURING ASPIRATION AND AIR FILLS THE SYRINGE, THE TUBE LIKELY HAS BEEN PLACED IN THE TRACHEA. Completely remove the tube and repeat the procedure. However, if repeated attempts to aspirate are met with immediate resistance and NO AIR ENTERS THE SYRINGE, the tube tip is positioned properly within the esophagus. If there is any question regarding placement, a lateral survey radiograph is indicated.",

In veterinary medicine, interpretation of BP centers on the systolic BP reading, not the diastolic reading (Table 4 -2).",

An effective way to evaluate the prostate for bacterial infection is to examine the prostatic fraction (the third fraction) of the male ejaculate; if separation proves to be too difficult, use the whole ejaculate specimen for culture. To better interpret the results of the prostatic culture, obtain urethral cultures before the ejaculate sample (see also Prostatic Wash). Collect the ejaculate fraction into a sterile side-mouth container (such as a 12-mL sterile plastic syringe container). Make subcultures with 0.1 mL of ejaculate onto differential media as for urethral swabs. The prostatic ejaculate culture shows significant bacterial infection if the number of bacteria in the prostatic culture is greater than 2 logs of growth compared with the bacteria in the urethral culture.",

Mycosel and mycobiotic agar are formulations of Sabouraud dextrose agar with cycloheximide and chloramphenicol added to inhibit fungal and bacterial contaminants. If a medium with cycloheximide is used, fungi sensitive to it will not be isolated. Organisms sensitive to cycloheximide include Cryptococcus neoformans, many members of the Zygomycota, some Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., Pseudallescheria boydii, and many agents of phaeohyphomycosis. Dermatophyte test medium is essentially a Sabouraud dextrose agar containing cycloheximide, gentamicin, and chlortetracycline as antifungal and antibacterial agents. The pH indicator phenol red has been added. Dermatophytes use protein in the medium first, and alkaline metabolites turn the medium red. When the protein is exhausted, the dermatophytes use carbohydrates and give off acid metabolites, and the color of the medium returns to yellow. Most other fungi use carbohydrates first and protein later, so they too may produce a red change in DTM, but only after a prolonged incubation (10 to 14 days or more). Consequently, examine DTM cultures daily for the first 10 days. Fungi such as Blastomyces dermatitidis, Sporothrix schenckii, Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, P. boydii, some Aspergillus spp., and others may cause a red change in DTM, so microscopic examination is essential to avoid an erroneous presumptive diagnosis.

Among the most convenient are antigen-detection systems available as point-ofcare tests for feline leukemia virus antigen in blood and canine parvovirus antigen in feces. These tests identify infected patients with excellent accuracy. Additionally, and seldom considered for their value, point-of-care tests for viral infections are especially capable of identifying patients that have not been exposed, allowing the clinician reliably to rule out infection by the organism for which the animal is tested. In addition, many commercial and point-of-care serologic assays are available that detect antibody to many of the viruses affecting dogs and cats. However, the positive predictive value of antibody tests is considerably lower than that for antigen tests. For example, a single ROUTINE PROCEDURES 473 positive antibody titer in a dog for canine distemper is evidence of prior exposure or vaccination. A POSITIVE antibody titer to a particular viral pathogen does not constitute a diagnosis of infection, especially in the absence of clinical signs. However, a NEGATIVE antibody titer generally does denote no prior exposure or failure to respond to vaccination. Obtaining acute and convalescent titers in a patient suspected of having an acute viral infection can be a reliable diagnostic tool if a fourfold or greater increase in titer can be demonstrated over 3 to 4 weeks. Acute and convalescent viral titers in individual patients are rarely performed in veterinary medicine. Virus isolation, however, is a valuable diagnostic tool that is underutilized in veterinary medicine, perhaps because of the limited number of commercial and university laboratories that provide viral isolation services.",

The advantage of using plasma is that separation of cells can be accomplished immediately after centrifugation or sedimentation, without the need to wait for clot formation and retraction. The disadvantage of plasma is that the presence of the anticoagulant interferes with many of the chemistry assay procedures. Plasma is less clear than serum, which may be an additional disadvantage for colorimetric assays. Plasma and serum are virtually identical in chemical composition except that plasma has fibrinogen and the anticoagulant. For many procedures in which plasma or whole blood is to be used, heparin is the anticoagulant of choice. Heparinized blood is the only acceptable specimen for blood pH and blood gas analyses. Although blood containing EDTA is acceptable for certain chemical procedures, it cannot be used for determination of plasma electrolytes because it contributes to and sequesters them from the specimen. In addition, EDTA can interfere with alkaline phosphatase levels, decrease total carbon dioxide, and elevated blood nonprotein nitrogen.",

However, when indicated, only attempt the technique in the anesthetized cat using the same technique described for the male cat. Take care to assess the health of the patient before administering the anesthetic. Urinary bladder catheterization can be accomplished with the use of a rubber or plastic, side-hole (blunt-ended) urinary catheter. The same catheter type used in male cats is effective in female cats. Instilling lidocaine 0.5% has been recommended as a means of decreasing sensitivity to the required manipulations and catheter insertion. However, if the cat is anesthetized adequately, this additional step is neither helpful nor necessary. Cleanse the vulva with an appropriate antiseptic. Catheterization can be accomplished with the cat in dorsal or ventral recumbency. Experience and size of the cat dictates which technique works best. Because the likelihood of successfully catheterizing a female cat's urinary bladder using a blind technique is low, a speculum is strongly recommended. However, there are only limited types of small-diameter speculums that are suitable. An inexpensive technique entails use of a sterilized otoscope speculum, with attached light source to facilitate visualization of the urethral orifice ( Figure 4 -16) . Insert the catheter through the speculum and into the urethra. The most significant drawback to this technique comes when using the male cat, polyurethane urinary catheter. The diameter of the otoscope speculum may not allow withdrawal of the speculum over the expanded end of the urinary catheter. A soft, rubber catheter, however, can be pulled through even the smallest otoscope speculum and is recommended when necessary to remove the speculum completely and leave the catheter in place. Once the urethral orifice can be visualized, pass the catheter into the orifice until urine flow is established.",

Make the scraping over healthy-appearing skin. Do not cleanse the skin of superficial scale or crusts. The technique for superficial skin scraping entails the use of mineral oil or pyrethrin ear drops applied to a clean scalpel blade and directly onto the area of skin to be scraped. Scraping begins as a gentle motion made in the direction of the hair coat. Gradually increase the pressure of the blade against the skin with repetitive scrapings over the same area. Take care not to lacerate the skin, although minor capillary bleeding at the site is common. Transpose material collected on the edge of the blade to a clean glass slide, cover it with a coverslip, and thoroughly examine the material under low magnification for evidence of ectoparasites. Note that for mites such as Chyletiella or scabies, finding just one mite or one egg is diagnostic and justifies implementing treatment.",

It may be helpful to apply gentle pressure to the skin or actually to squeeze the area of interest between the thumb and a finger in at attempt to force mites from the deeper to the more superficial skin. In some breeds (e.g., Old English Sheepdogs and shar peis) recovering mites on a skin scraping can be particularly difficult. In such cases, where Demodex infestation is highly suspected but the results of repeated skin scrapings are negative, a skin biopsy is appropriate. Alternatively, a procedure called a trichogram that involves pulling (plucking) a few hairs from the hair follicles using a hemostat may be diagnostic. Once the hairs are plucked from the skin, place them on a glass slide that has been preprepared with a drop of mineral oil, add a coverslip, and examine the hair shaft under low magnification. Half of all dogs with Demodex infestation will have a positive trichogram. ",

Always weigh the animal before and after removing abdominal fluid. Any subsequent gain in weight indicates a reaccumulation of abdominal fluid. Place the animal in left lateral recumbency and restrain it in this position. Clip and surgically prepare a 1-to 3-inch square between the bladder and the umbilicus just lateral to the midline. If the bladder is distended, empty it before performing paracentesis. Infiltrate the paracentesis site with lidocaine 0.5% using a 22-to 25-gauge needle. In most cases, local anesthesia is not necessary. Abdominal puncture can be made with an 18-to 20-gauge needle. When the abdominal puncture has been made, allow the animal to rest quietly to facilitate drainage of the fluid. Some clinicians recommend tapping while the patient is in a standing position in the hope of obtaining more complete drainage. Changing the patient's position after the tapping may result in needle-tip laceration of intraabdominal organs. Aspiration may be easier if a specially adapted needle with multiple holes drilled in the shaft is used because it is less likely to become plugged with omentum. Ideally, tap four quadrants of the abdomen. Single-needle taps are not as accurate as instilling a lavage fluid (warmed lactated Ringer's solution) into the abdomen and examining the lavage fluid. Measure the amount of fluid obtained, and examine the fluid to determine whether it is an exudate or a transudate. Cytologic examination and culture also may be performed. Rather than drain the abdominal fluid completely, it may be better to spare protein loss and mobilize the fluids with diuretics. Paracentesis also can be performed by using a sterile intravenous catheter to enter the abdomen. When performing paracentesis, ultrasonographic guidance can prove valuable in placing the needle into the compartmental space desired and in avoiding complications. The major complications in abdominal paracentesis are perforated hollow viscus, laceration of abdominal organs, and iatrogenic peritonitis. ",

Punch biopsy of the skin is a quick and accurate means of removing a small sample of diseased skin for histopathologic examination. Select a site that is well developed but not traumatized or excoriated. The sample should include little or no normal tissue. If the lesion (pustule, vesicle) can be identified early in its development and if the biopsy sample is taken only from the lesion, one may obtain a superior specimen. It is best not to take too large a sample that contains much normal skin; by mistake, the technician might take a section that misses the lesion. Proper selection of the biopsy site is crucial to accurate diagnosis. Carefully clip the hair from the lesion. Lightly blot the skin with 70% alcohol. Avoid superficial trauma while cleaning the skin. Inject a small subcutaneous bleb of 2.0% lidocaine to deaden the area. Special equipment needed for the biopsy includes a 4-mm, 6-mm, or 8-mm biopsy punch and 10% buffered formalin solution. After the area has been anesthetized with lidocaine, press and rotate the biopsy punch through the skin until the subcutaneous tissue is penetrated. Remove the biopsy specimen by \"spearing\" the subcutaneous fat with a fine needle. Do not grasp the specimen with a forceps. Blot the specimen gently between two paper towels. Spread the tissue out gently (like a pancake), place the specimen epidermal side up on a piece of cardboard or tongue depressor, press the specimen gently to cause adhesion, and drop the specimen into the formalin fixative. The skin defect may be closed with one or two simple interrupted sutures. If deep subcutaneous tissue or large biopsy samples are needed, a punch biopsy is inadequate. Use a small (No. 15) scalpel blade to obtain an appropriate sample. In all cases in which skin biopsies are made, take multiple samples to increase the odds that at least one will have diagnostic lesions. Specimens submitted to laboratories should be accompanied by extensive, detailed clinical information, including a differential diagnosis.

General anesthesia is a reasonable alternative when feasible. Biopsy sites in the liver can be selected best when needle biopsy techniques are used along with laparoscopy or ultrasound techniques. Blind percutaneous needle biopsies of the liver can be performed with relative safety if the liver is significantly enlarged and easily palpated. However, blind biopsies do carry the risk that the operator is unable to determine the impact of penetrating the liver if only an abdominal radiograph and impression of abdominal palpation are available. In cases where the liver is not palpable, blind biopsy carries significantly higher risk and should be performed only when no alternative exits. A modified percutaneous liver biopsy can be performed by the following method. Before biopsy, have the animal fast, and remove any ascitic fluid. Place the animal in dorsal recumbency, and place a local block in the midline of the skin and abdomen at the caudoventral aspect of the left hepatic lobe. The incision into the peritoneal cavity should be large enough to accommodate the gloved index finger. Make a separate skin puncture site in the abdominal wall to accommodate the biopsy needle. Use the index finger manually to fix the left hepatic lobe (or other desired hepatic lobe) against the diaphragm or other adjacent structures, and insert the outer cannula and stylet through the abdominal wall in the isolated hepatic lobe. Remove the stylet, and rapidly insert the cutting prongs. If properly placed, the cutting prongs should not go through the entire hepatic lobe. Advance the outer cannula over the blades of the cutting prongs, thus entrapping the hepatic tissue material within the cutting prongs. Remove the biopsy needle. Using a wooden applicator stick, carefully place the biopsy specimen into fixative. Biopsy samples can be used to prepare slides for cytologic examination, and the biopsy needle may be cultured.

Find an isoelectric lead; that is, a lead for which the total number of positve (upward) and negative (downward) deflections of the QRS complex is equal to zero (Figure 4-32) . When there is no perfectly isoelectric lead, use the one that comes closest. 2.

Determine whether the perpendicular lead is positive or negative on the patient's electrocardiogram. If the perpendicular lead is negative, the axis is at the negative end of that lead (each lead has a plus and a minus pole marked. If the perpendicular lead is positive, the mean electrical axis is at the positive end of the perpendicular lead. For example, if aVL is isoelectric (normally it is), lead II is its perpendicular.

Suspected lesions inside the larynx may be difficult to visualize with or without endoscopic equipment. Examination of the trachea and main stem bronchi requires endoscopic evaluation to assess the integrity of the airway for conditions such as collapsed trachea, mediastinal tumors, hilar lymph node enlargement, parasitic nodules (Filaroides osleri), and foreign body aspiration. In addition, tracheobronchoscopy is a valuable technique that permits culturing and cytologic examination of material from bronchi involved in chronic respiratory disease.

To determine the rate of intravenous infusion of the fluids and additives, take the total volume of the fluids that have been prescribed and divide the total volume by the total number of hours in the day that are available for safe administration of the fluids. There should be no need to front-load the deficit repair fluid volume as long as the intravascular volume has been stabilized previously. 2. Administer the fluids over as many hours as possible to allow the patient as much time as possible to redistribute and fully use the administered fluids and electrolytes. With faster administration, a diuresis will occur and more of the fluids will be excreted in urine. Do not administer fluids continuously intravenously when the patient cannot be observed periodically to ascertain whether the fluids are continuing to run at an appropriate rate and that the administration line has not become disconnected. If the available time is limited (i.e., less than 12 hours) or if extra time is needed for safe administration of the fluids, an alternative plan (e.g., administering some of the required fluids subcutaneously) is indicated. 3. Intravenous administration of fluids is the preferred route because the fluid is dispersed rapidly and is immediately available to the patient. Intravenous administration may be inconvenient in some practice settings. The prescribed fluid can be administered subcutaneously in several divided doses. The subcutaneous route is usually well tolerated by patients, and therapy often is efficacious. However, the subcutaneous route is slower in onset than the intravenous route, is less efficacious than the intravenous route because some patients (especially those that are severely dehydrated and vasoconstricted) do not absorb the fluids well or at all, and it carries a slight risk of infection. Fluids can be administered orally or via stomach tube, in several divided doses, as long as the gastrointestinal tract is functional. Fluids also can be administered intraperitoneally. The intraperitoneal route is characterized by the same advantages and disadvantages as the subcutaneous route, but in addition there is a danger of injury or perforation of an abdominal organ. Fluids also can be administered via the intramedullary route. Intramedullary administration is more difficult than subcutaneous or intraperitoneal administration but is associated with much more rapid and reliable systemic uptake. The intramedullary route may be useful when venous access is difficult (e.g., a severely dehydrated kitten or puppy). 4. Fluids may be administered through central or peripheral veins. Indwelling catheters must be introduced and maintained aseptically. All fluids and administration sets must be sterile. Fluids with osmolalities less than 600 mOsm/L can be administered safely via a peripheral vein. Administer fluids with osmolalities greater than 700 mOsm/L via a large central vein because hyperosmolar fluids may cause thrombophlebitis if administered via small peripheral veins. 5. Control of the infusion rate is difficult when fluids are administered by gravity.",

One method, intravenous hyperalimentation, is reserved for patients that are not able to tolerate any food being introduced via the gastrointestinal tract and represents a radical, and ideally transient, departure from normal. However, enteral feeding, which is always preferable to intravenous hyperalimentation, allows the clinician several options for administering food directly into the gastrointestinal tract. However, consideration of several variables is critical when one is initiating enteral feeding programs, such as the patient's diagnosis, attitude, status of the gastrointestinal tract, and the ability of the patient to digest and absorb food once introduced. In addition, consideration of the type and constituency of the diet provided is important. Although the options available for enteral nutrition are much greater that those for intravenous hyperalimentation, the clinician must consider dietary requirements carefully when planning enteral nutritional support. When evaluating enteral feeding for the individual patient, the clinician has four basic options: nasoesophageal tube, pharyngostomy tube (least recommended), esophagostomy tube, and percutaneous gastroscopy tube (which can be performed using an endoscope or performed using the so-called blind technique). All techniques involve use of polyurethane or silicone feeding tube. The nasoesophageal tube placement technique does not require general anesthesia and may be inserted using a topical anesthetic only.

Hold the head gently upward for a few seconds to allow the solution to reach the back of the nasal cavity. In most patients, it is desirable to wait 1 to 2 minutes and then to repeat the instillation in the same nostril. For larger dogs, 2% lidocaine solution (0.5 to 2.0 mL) gradually instilled into the nostril is an alternative technique to achieve topical anesthesia. Lubricate the tube with a thin coat of a water-soluble lubricant, such a 2% lidocaine lubricating gel. Pass the tube into the nasal cavity while directing the tube tip medial and ventral into the ventral meatus. The anatomic shape of a dog's nostril usually requires directing the tip medially but almost perpendicular to the plane of the nasal cavity to facilitate insertion. Initial resistance (pressure, not pain) usually is perceived, and the patient's head as expected quickly retracts, leaving the operator holding the tube tip some inches away from the patient's nose. Be persistent. Repeat the procedure, as necessary, by quickly inserting the first inch or more of the tube into the nostril. Once started, the remainder of the technique is relatively straightforward. As the tube reaches the caudal aspect of the nasopharynx, it should pass directly into the esophagus with little or no resistance. Affix the tube remaining outside the patient to the head or face using a \"butterfly\" tape, gauze, suture (Figure 4-37) , or skin glue (skin glue [Superglue] generally is NOT recommended because this can result in loss of hair and skin pigment when the glue becomes dislodged).",

The advantage of the procedure is that it is minimally invasive, although general anesthesia is required. Laparoscopy does allow limited visualization of several organs, at least in part. Visualization of needle biopsies of kidney, liver, and/or spleen is also possible during the procedure. The disadvantage is that the required equipment can be expensive and specific training and experience are required to become efficient at the procedure. Additionally, insufflation of the abdomen must be monitored in addition to monitoring the patient's quality of respirations and oxygenation (pulse oximetry). The Dyonics Needlescope (Smith & Nephew, Andover, Massachusetts) is a small fiberoptic laparoscope 1.7 or 2.2 mm in diameter. The device does require a high-intensity light source, but because of its small size, it can be inserted readily into the abdomen. Abdominal insufflation and laparoscopy require general anesthesia, neuroleptanalgesia with local anesthesia, or rarely (in the critically ill animal), regional local anesthesia alone. The depth and type of anesthesia or analgesia depend on the condition of the patient and the skill and experience of the examiner. Before laparoscopy, perform a cleansing enema. Surgically prepare the laparoscopy site. To insufflate the abdomen, use a Verees pneumoperitoneum needle. Place the needle 3 to 4 cm below the umbilicus, along the linea alba. Inject 10 mL of saline through the needle, and attempt aspiration to ensure that a blood vessel or hollow viscus has not been penetrated.

The reflex tear secretors are the main lacrimal gland and the accessory lacrimal glands. The production of normal lacrimal secretions can be tested by using Schirmer's tear test, a standardized filter paper (Figure 4 -46) that effectively measures the rate of tear production in millimeters per minute. Schirmer's tear strips now are impregnated with a blue dye to facilitate visualization of the distance (in millimeters) that the tear migrates during the 1-minute test. Each eye can be tested independently, or both eyes can be tested simultaneously in the cooperative patient. Carefully fold the notched end of the test strip before removing it from the plastic package. Insert the folded end into the lower conjunctival cul-de-sac (Figure 4-47) and begin the timing. Maintain the Schirmer's test strip in position by gently holding the eyelids closed but not touching the paper. At the end of 1 minute, note the degree (distance) of wetting that occurred and record it in the medical record. The normal dog and cat should produce wetting over 10 to 25 mm in 1 minute for each eye. Amounts less than that are consistent with keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Amounts greater than 25 mm may be normal or may be consistent with excessive tear production, or epiphora.",

In the event ultrasound capability is not available, contrast study of the upper gastrointestinal tract still can be used. However, the clinician must appreciate that a barium contrast study of the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum has a low sensitivity as a diagnostic test. That is, negative findings are not expected to correlate well with the absence of clinical disease. A negative study does not rule out disease. Likewise, a contrast study of the upper gastrointestinal tract is not recognized for its ability to confirm a diagnosis gastrointestinal tract disease, even when disease is present. Perhaps the greatest value in performing the upper gastrointestinal series in a dog or cat today centers on the need to identify a displacement of the stomach and/or small intestine because of an extraluminal mass lesion or congenital defect in the patient. In addition, the use of a microfine barium suspension may facilitate identification of intestinal ulcers, irregularities (e.g., intraluminal neoplasia), and radiolucent foreign bodies.

In male cats, use a 4F balloon catheter or a 3.5F Tomcat open-ended urethral catheter. Insert the catheter 1.5 cm into the penile urethra. If the urethra is patent, 2 to 3 mL of contrast material will enable visualization of the urethra, but increased amounts of contrast material (2 to 3 mL/lb) injected into the bladder are needed for maximum distention of the preprostatic urethra. A voiding positive contrast urethrogram is necessary to visualize the distal (penile) urethra. Apply external pressure to the bladder (using a wooden spoon or other external compression device), and radiograph the distal urethra.",

Determine the correct time to inseminate by test-teasing with a stud, by cytologic examination of vaginal smears, or by vaginoscopic examination to determine the day when vaginal folds change from round to angular. Breed the day after the bitch first stands staunchly to accept service and \"flags\" her tail or during cytologic indications of estrus (complete cornification of vaginal epithelial cells) but before WBCs reappear in the smears. Breed at 48-hour intervals until the female dog goes out of heat or for three or four inseminations. 2. If the vulva is soiled, clean it thoroughly with alcohol swabs (Box 4-20). 3. Gently aspirate semen through the inseminating pipette into the warm syringe. 4. Using a gloved left index finger (not lubricated) as a guide, insert the pipette through the vulva and dorsally into the vagina and forward to the cervix. Elevate the bitch's rear quarters to a 45-degree angle by having an assistant pick up the bitch by holding the hock region so that no pressure is applied to the ventral abdomen and uterus. Eject the semen gently and slowly. Eject a bubble of air to push all the semen through the pipette. Deposit the semen in the anterior vagina. 5. Remove the pipette, and hold the bitch in an elevated position for 5 minutes. During this time, use the finger encased in a sterile glove to \"feather\" the ceiling of the vagina to stimulate constrictor activity. This may be important to simulate a \"tie\" and transport semen into the uterus. 6. Lower the bitch to the normal position, and immediately walk her for 5 minutes so that she does not sit down or jump up on a person and allow semen to run back out of the vagina. 7. For best conception, inseminate undiluted fresh semen immediately. 8. Refrigerated extended semen is best used within 24 to 48 hours if possible. However, refrigerated semen has been kept viable for up to 9 days with proper care. Skim milk has been used as an economical and adequate extender. Heat milk to 92\u00b0to 94\u00b0C for 10 minutes, cool it, and skim it at room temperature. To each milliliter, add 1000 units of crystalline penicillin. If Pseudomonas spp. affect the semen, polymyxin B may be added at 200 units/mL of extender. Dilute semen with extender at a semen/extender ratio of 1:1 to 1:4. Extend canine semen for freezing with a diluent containing 11% lactose, 4% glycerin, and 20% egg yolk. Refrigerate the 1:4 diluted semen; then pipette 0.05-mL portions into depressions in a block of dry ice and hold them for 8 minutes to freeze. Store the frozen pellets in liquid nitrogen. Frozen semen can be thawed in buffered saline at 30\u00b0to 37\u00b0C. Good semen may be stored in liquid nitrogen for many years without significant loss of motility. Conception is best when large numbers of thawed motile sperm are deposited in the cervix or uterine cavity. Conception is poor when thawed semen is placed in the anterior vagina, as done in artificial breeding with raw semen. ",

Take the stud and an estrous teaser bitch (if available) to a quiet room where there will be no distractions and where there is good traction (rubber mats or rug) for mounting by the stud. 2. Hold the bitch, and allow the stud to \"flirt\" (become aroused) for several minutes. If the bitch is in heat, a brief period of foreplay (I am not really certain if \"foreplay\" is an appropriate word to use when describing the mating behavior of dogs, but you get the point) with both dogs unrestricted will help the process. 3. If necessary, have assistants restrain the muzzled bitch and control the stud by a collar and leash. Bring the stud up to the rear end of the bitch, and allow him to mount her or keep his nose in the region of her perineal area. 4. Attach the artificial vagina to the semen collection tube, and apply a scant amount of lubricant to the opening of the artificial vagina. 5. If mounting occurs, allow the stud to grasp the bitch and start to thrust his pelvis in an attempt to copulate. Gently, from the side of the sheath, grasp the penis by the prepuce and move the prepuce back over the engorged bulbus glandis; while applying the artificial vagina to the shaft of the penis, apply pressure with the thumb and forefinger proximal to the exposed glandis. This usually can be done with one motion as the stud is thrusting. If the stud is shy and not interested, massage the penis slightly in the prepuce or in the artificial vagina to cause erection. When erection of the bulbus is felt, reflect the prepuce posteriorly to free the bulbus. Apply pressure with the thumb and forefinger behind the bulbus, circling the shaft of the penis. After completion of the most rapid pelvic thrusting and ejaculation of the sperm-rich fractions of semen (1 to 3 mL), twist the penis 180 degrees backward in a horizontal plane, between the hind legs, so that the penis remains in the same plane as in the forward position with the thumb and forefinger still applying pressure around the circumference of the penis proximal to the bulbus. The penis cannot be twisted unless the prepuce is reflected posterior or proximal to the bulbus glandis. Twisting the penis in this position simulates a natural \"tie\" and allows the person collecting the semen to better visualize the collection (artificial vaginas are widely available now and are much preferred because they simulate the natural pressure of the vagina). The first drops of ejaculate may be discarded, especially if any urine is present. Collect the sperm-rich fraction separately. A clear ejaculate is prostatic fluid, which may be collected separately for examination. 6 . After semen collection, place the penis in the forward position, straighten out the prepuce to avoid paraphimosis, and remove the bitch from the room. Allow the stud to lick the erect penis and lose the erection. Check the stud for evidence of paraphimosis before he is released or caged. The ejaculate consists of three fractions: First fraction: Urethral secretion (usually clear fluid)-0.1 to 2 mL within 50 seconds, pH 6.3. If evidence of urine is present, discard this fraction and do not add it to the sperm-rich fraction. In most ejaculates collected from dogs, the first and second semen fractions are collected together. Second fraction: Sperm-containing secretion (milky opaque fluid)-0.5 to 3 mL within 1 to 2 minutes, pH 6.1. Third fraction: Prostatic secretion (usually clear fluid)-2 to 20 mL within 30 minutes, pH 6.5. The total specimen is 0.3 to 20 mL, pH 6.4. Because the first and third fractions are clear, waterlike material and the second fraction is milky-opaque, the clinician can separate them by changing collecting tubes as each fraction is ejaculated. Collection of only enough prostatic fluid to rinse the sperm fraction into the test tube is best. Too much prostatic fluid may be detrimental to the longevity of sperm in storage. Collecting individual fractions may be important in determining the site of an inflammatory reaction, but for artificial insemination only the spermrich, low-volume ejaculate is needed for insemination, dilution, or freezing. 7.

Clinical signs related to the upper respiratory tract in dogs and cats are among the most common presenting complaints encountered in small animal practice and interestingly are frequent reasons for referral to specialty practices and veterinary teaching hospitals. The oral and nasal cavities are important portals of entry for foreign body entrapment and infectious agents. In addition to the occurrence of nasal neoplasia and trauma, it is not surprising that upper respiratory tract diseases in dogs and cats are common presentations. However, upper respiratory signs can be associated with significantly different underlying causes. Localizing the problem amid a variety of clinical signs in an anatomically complex area represents significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges to even the most astute clinician.

For example, using the foregoing anatomic limits, the upper respiratory tract can be categorized into three distinct compartments. EACH compartment is associated with a defining clinical sign (Table 4 -12).

Owners that present a dog for sneezing are likely to be accurate in their description of the problem. However, the presence or absence of a nasal discharge may be more difficult to establish. Volume, character, and frequency of the discharge ultimately determine whether the owner will have even observed this sign. The astute owner will report whether the discharge is unilateral or bilateral. In the patient that has a history of sneezing and nasal discharge, instillation of a topical nasal decongestant into each nostril occasionally will provoke sneezing and elicit the nature of any discharge that is present. Sneezing and/or nasal discharge localize the problem to the nose, nasal cavity, and paranasal sinuses. However, thorough examination of the nose and nasal cavity can be difficult, even with the availability of appropriate endoscopy equipment. In addition to careful examination of facial symmetry, the first part of the examination begins in the oral cavity, with emphasis on the maxilla, the hard palate, and the canine teeth. Examine the hard palate for evidence of trauma (penetrating or nonpenetrating) and congenital cleft palate (puppies). Carefully probe the medial aspect of the maxillary canine teeth for evidence of oronasal fistulas.

Introduce the catheter blindly until resistance is met as the tube attempts to enter smaller airways.",

Aliquots of 3 to 5 mL can be used per collection attempt in small dogs and cats, whereas volumes up to 10 and 20 mL are appropriate for larger dogs. With the catheter positioned as deep as practical in the airway, infuse the entire volume of saline. Gentle agitation (intermittent aspiration/injection) may facilitate sample collection. If 10 mL is infused, retrieval of only 1 to 2 mL as a final volume per collection attempt is not unusual. The remaining fluid is rapidly (seconds) absorbed into the pulmonary vasculature. IMPORTANT: When performing this procedure, DO NOT withdraw the rubber catheter while maintaining a high negative pressure on the syringe. Doing so actually may tear mucosa away from the airway and could lead to pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. The procedure can be repeated safely in the same patient several times. Collection of three to five samples is routine. More samples may be indicated depending on the patient's condition and response to the procedure. Monitoring of patients undergoing a tracheal wash procedure for oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry) throughout the procedure is recommended. In some patients with reactive airways, infusion of saline may cause significant bronchoconstriction, detected by a rapid decline in oxygen saturation. Process samples collected immediately. Submit at least one sample of liquid (not a swab of the liquid) for bacterial culture and sensitivity or MIC. Quantitative cultures are impractical because specimens will be diluted. If the sample appears to be highly cellular (characterized by turbidity), place aliquots into tubes containing EDTA.",

            "text": "Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is an alternative diagnostic procedure to transtracheal aspiration and endotracheal wash. Bronchoalveolar lavage has the advantage of retrieving fluid samples from distal airways and alveoli. This is a highly diagnostic procedure indicated in patients with generalized lung and regional (interstitial and/or airway) disease that are not in respiratory distress. Patients suspected of having allergic or infectious respiratory disease or neoplasia are candidates for BAL. Although BAL is used as a therapeutic procedure in human beings with chronic lung disease associated with accumulations of surfactant in the alveoli, there is no therapeutic indication for BAL in dogs or cats. The technique for BAL entails instilling sufficiently large volumes of fluid into the distal airways to reach, and recover, reasonable cytological samples representative of small airways and alveoli. Several variations on the technique are described, but all recommend blind or visual placement of a catheter or bronchoscope into an airway of a lung lobe such that the airway is occluded. Sterile, nonbacteriostatic 0.9% saline, warmed to approximately body temperature and drawn into prepared syringes, is the fluid of choice. The volume of fluid varies with the size of the patient. Defined doses of saline per kilogram of body mass have not been described. In large dogs, two 25-mL aliquots (50 mL total) can be infused into each lobe sampled. In small dogs and cats, total volumes per lobe generally are restricted to 10-mL aliquots. Recovery may be as low as 2 to 5 mL with each attempt.",

Saline can be infused from a syringe directly through the biopsy channel of the endoscope. The bronchoscope serves as the infusion catheter. Using this technique, samples can be collected effectively from multiple lobes. Blind placement (nonbronchoscopic) BAL using a rubber end-hole catheter is required in cats and small dogs. Blind placement is also appropriately used in patients with generalized lung or airway disease when discrete placement of bronchoscope cannot be accomplished reliably.",

Bronchodilators: Always use bronchodilators when administering drugs that may be irritating and constricting, such as isoetharine hydrochloride 1% and phenylephrine 0.25%, 0.5 to 1.0 mL in 2 to 3 mL of saline 3 to 4 times daily. 2. Antibiotics: Antibiotics are poorly absorbed from the respiratory mucosa. Systemic administration of most antibiotics produces adequate pulmonary concentration for antibacterial effect. For Bordetella spp. that are located at the tips of bronchial cilia, topical contact via nebulization may be useful. Antibiotics that have been used successfully and safely include kanamycin (250 mg in 5 mL saline twice daily); gentamicin (50 mg in 5 mL saline twice daily); and polymyxin B (333,000 IU in 5 mL saline twice daily). 3. Bland solutions: Use these in large volume for prolonged mist effect: 0.9% sterile saline (5 to 200 mL as needed); glycerine (5% in saline); and propylene glycol (10% to 20% solution in saline). 4. Detergents and mucolytics: These compounds are irritating and currently are not recommended by most authors. 5. Antifoaming agents: Administer ethyl alcohol (70% solution 5 to 10 mL twice daily). an appropriately sized flexible catheter, which is advanced to the point of obstruction. Attach a catheter-tipped 60-mL syringe filled with warmed (my preference) sterile saline and a water-soluble lubricant mixture (approximately 2 parts saline to 1 part lubricant) to the urinary catheter. An assistant places a gloved (always preferred) finger into the rectum to identify and occlude the lumen of the pelvic urethra at the level of the pubis. Subsequently, infuse saline forcefully into the catheter to dilate the urethra proximal to the obstructing urolith. At that point, release the digital pressure on the proximal urethra while the solution continues to be infused through the catheter. Objectively, the pressure within the urethra forces small stones retrograde into the urinary bladder, thereby relieving the obstruction. NOTE: The objective of this procedure is NOT to push the calculi into the bladder with the catheter, because this can substantially injure the urethral mucosa, nor to force the calculi around the catheter and move it antegrade.",

Various recommendations have been made regarding how to position the patient with respect to the individual performing the procedure. In the technique described, right-handed persons should position the patient in right-lateral recumbency. Left-handed persons should position the patient in left lateral recumbency.To identify the site of needle penetration in the skin, the landmarks are a vertical line connecting the anterior edge of the first cervical vertebra and a horizontal line from the occipital protuberance that runs parallel to the spine. The point of intersection of the two lines represents the point of needle penetration.

The colon usually is filled with barium 6 hours after oral administration and may contain barium for 2 to 3 days following administration. Barium contrast radiography is contraindicated if perforation of the stomach or upper gastrointestinal tract is suspected. In these cases, use water-soluble contrast media such as the oral diatrizoates because leakage into the abdomen will produce no foreign body granuloma. In addition, do not administer barium sulfate when an obstruction of the lower bowel may be present. In these cases, barium may only contribute to the obstipation.The following radiographic views are recommended following administration of radiographic contrast material: 1. Immediately following administration of contrast material obtain a ventrodorsal, right lateral, and left lateral views. The right lateral view shows the pylorus of the stomach filled with barium, and the left lateral view shows the cardia and fundic portion filled with barium. The objective is to evaluate the distended stomach and initial gastric emptying. 2. Twenty to 30 minutes following administration of contrast material, obtain ventrodorsal and right lateral views to assess the stomach, pyloric emptying, and the proximal duodenum. 3. Sixty minutes following administration of contrast material, repeat the ventrodorsal and right lateral recumbency views to assess the small intestine. 4.

Barium sulfate enemas are contraindicated in suspected obstruction of the colon and rupture or perforation of the colon.

The arterial phase demonstrates renal blood flow; the nephrogram demonstrates the accumulation of contrast agent in the renal tubules and is used to evaluate renal parenchyma; the pyelogram phase evaluates the urinary collecting system, including the ureters; and the cystogram reveals the collection of contrast agent in the urinary bladder. Excretory urography does not result in any quantitative information about renal function and is not a substitute for renal function tests. The degree of visualization of contrast material within the renal excretory system depends on the concentration of iodine in the contrast medium, the technique of excretory urography performed, the state of hydration of the patient, renal blood flow, and the functional capacity of the kidneys. The contrast medium most commonly used is a diatrizoate or iothalamate compound. Rapidly administer 850 mg/kg of an iodine compound intravenously. Obtain a ventrodorsal radiograph at 10 seconds after injection, and repeat ventrodorsal and lateral radiographs 1, 3, 5, 15, 20, and 40 minutes following injection. This method is the current standard technique. If the patient's blood urea nitrogen level is greater than or equal to 50 mg/dL or the creatinine level is greater than 4 mg/dL, double the dose rate.Lesions that can be detected by using intravenous urography are renal mass lesions; neoplasia; renal cysts; renal and ureteral traumatic lesions; pyelonephritis; hydroureter; hydronephrosis; renal agenesis; hypoplasia; pelvic and ureteral obstructions (calculi, blood clots); renal parasites; ectopic ureter; and duplication of the collecting system.",

This method can reveal conditions such as urethral neoplasms, strictures, trauma, calculi, or other anomalies.The technique involves the injection of an aqueous iodine contrast medium into the urethra through a ureteral or balloon-tipped catheter. The radiopaque contrast material is mixed to a three-to fivefold dilution with sterile lubricating jelly to increase the viscosity. A dilution of 1:3 contrast medium with sterile distilled water or saline also can be used. Before retrograde contrast urethography is performed, give the animal a cleansing enema. Sedation or anesthesia may be necessary. Inject 5 to 10 mL of contrast medium. Near the end of the injection, while the urethra is still under pressure, obtain a lateral radiograph.If the urinary bladder is to be distended with contrast material or air, remove urine from the bladder. In the male dog, position the catheter so that the tip of the catheter is distal to the os penis. Inject lidocaine 1 to 2 mL into the urethral lumen to anesthetize the urethra adjacent to the balloon-tipped catheter. Take extreme care in the amount of fluid placed in the bladder if the urethra is occluded by a balloon catheter. Overdistention of the bladder results in hematuria, pyuria, urinary bladder rupture, and mild to severe bladder inflammation.

Ideally, the contrast material should be relatively nontoxic and absorbable, should provide good contrast, and should be distributed evenly throughout the subarachnoid space. Indications for myelography are progressive neurologic disease in which survey radiographs have failed to reveal substantive findings.The nonionic water-soluble agents currently are preferred for myelography. The agents are iopamidol, iohexol, and ioxaglate. These agents are stable in solution and much more convenient than metrizamide and have low toxicity and low epileptogenic activity, are inert to nervous tissue, have no long-term side effects, and are resorbed and excreted rapidly from the CSF. These agents can be injected into the subarachnoid space at the cerebellomedullary cistern or at the caudal lumbar spine (preferred) at a dose level of 0.22 mL/kg. Five minutes after cisternal injection, if there is no obstruction, the cervical and thoracic cord segments are outlined, and after 10 to 15 minutes the entire cord is outlined.Patients undergoing myelography can be pretreated with diazepam at a dose of 0.25 mL/kg, not to exceed 10 mL in larger patients. Diazepam has a short biologic half-life of 30 to 45 minutes and may be better used after myelography if seizures do occur.Myelography is a relatively high-risk procedure and should be performed only by individuals with additional training and experience. The following steps are involved: 1. Have the patient fast for 18 to 24 hours preceding myelography if the procedure is elective. 2. Anesthetize the patient with a short-acting anesthetic agent, and maintain the animal on the gas anesthetic of choice. Maintain an intravenous catheter and good hydration through fluid support. 3. Clip and surgically prepare the skin over the cisterna magna or in the lumbosacral area, depending on where one wishes to enter the spinal canal. When fluoroscopic visualization is available, myelograms can be done for all animals from a lumbar subarachnoid tap. Lumbar puncture can be made between L1 and L6 or between L4 and L5. Use a short-bevel spinal needle (1. ",

            "text": "Cholecystography refers to the use of contrast material to facilitate imaging of the gall bladder and the common bile duct. Use of this technique depends on the ability of selected radiopaque compounds to be removed from the blood and excreted via active transport by hepatocytes. Contrast agents for cholecystography can be administered either orally or intravenously. Oral cholecystographic examination requires that the contrast agent (1) enter the small bowel, (2) be absorbed and enter the portal circulation, and (3) be excreted material from testes unless the testes are azoospermic. Damage produced after the sperm have left the testes may indicate epididymal disease or may be the result of cold, trauma, or osmotic or urinary contamination. When abnormalities are found, it is wise to obtain two or three semen samples within a few days for baseline evaluation and then repeat the studies in 4 to 6 weeks to determine whether there is a healing or regressing trend. There are usually 64 days from the date of sperm formation to the date of ejaculation: 54 days in the testes and 10 days in transport and maturation in the epididymis.Normal male dogs can be used at stud once every other day indefinitely or once every day for 7 to 9 days, after which sperm numbers in the ejaculate will decline but not to less than the numbers needed to achieve conception.",

            "text": "Semen can be collected by means of electroejaculation in the anesthetized male cat (and, after reviewing the following procedures for use of an artificial vagina, this technique may be preferred). For semen collection with an artificial vagina, the male cat must be trained for several weeks and even then, not all male cats will effectively ejaculate; thus the artificial vagina method generally is not used except in larger catteries. Teaser queens can be produced by injecting spayed females with 0.25 mg of estradiol cyclopentyl propionate, or normal queens in heat can be used.An artificial vagina can be made by cutting off the bulb end of a 2-mL rubber bulb pipette and inserting a 3 \u00d7 44-mm test tube into the cut end. Place the apparatus into a 60-mL plastic bottle filled with warm water (52\u00b0C). Stretch the rolled end of the rubber pipette over the rim of the bottle. Sparingly lubricate the opening of the pipette (\"vagina\") with sterile aqueous lubricant. Place a teaser queen in a quiet cage with the tom. As the tom mounts the queen and develops an erection, place the artificial vagina over the penis. The ejaculation takes 1 to 4 minutes, the semen volume is 0.05 mL (range is 0.03 to 0.3 mL), and the semen contains 50 million to 100 million sperm. Motility is normally 80% to 90%, and pH is 7.4. There should be less than 10% abnormal sperm. The semen can be diluted for insemination to contain 10 million sperm in 0.1 mL of saline; then each 0.1 mL is an adequate insemination volume. With such small samples, microequipment is essential to avoid losing semen by surface absorption. Toms can undergo this collection procedure 3 times weekly and maintain excellent semen quality and libido.Queens can be detected in estrus by stroking their backs and necks daily and noting the arching of the back and the extended and treading action of the rear feet when they are in receptive heat. Estrus is verified by examination of vaginal smears, which show epithelial cell cornification with pyknotic nuclei. Insemination is carried out with a 0.25-mL syringe and a bulb-tipped 9-cm spinal needle. Ovulation is induced by intramuscular injection of 25 \u00b5g of gonadotropin-releasing hormone or 250 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin. If insemination is repeated 24 hours later, the conception rate improves from 60% to 75%.Understanding the most commonly diagnosed causes of sneezing and nasal discharge is especially helpful in patient management. In no particular order, the most common differential diagnoses for sneezing and/or nasal discharge include the following: 1. Oronasal fistulas: Especially common in middle-aged to older dogs, despite a history of recent dental prophylaxis. Empiric treatment with an orally administered antibiotic typically results in rapid and complete resolution of clinical signs, but only during the time the patient is receiving the antibiotic. Diagnosis is confirmed by probing the gingival sulcus of the upper canine teeth. 2. Nasal neoplasia: Most commonly reported in dogs between 8 and 10 years of age (range: 1 to 15 years of age). No breed is predisposed, but the condition is uncommon in brachycephalic breeds. Persistent nasal discharge, sneezing, and intermittent epistaxis are common presenting signs. Nasal radiographs may demonstrate lytic bone lesions. Lysis of the vomer strongly supports neoplasia versus mycotic rhinitis. Exposure to tobacco smoke has been associated with 2.5 times greater risk in longnosed dogs. No or minimal response of the discharge to antibiotics occurs. Eighty percent of nasal tumors are malignant. Adenocarcinoma is most common, followed by squamous cell carcinoma. Sarcomas account for small number of nasal tumors. 3. Mycotic rhinitis: Difficult to distinguish from neoplasia. Persistent and voluminous mucoid nasal discharge, with or without sneezing, and nasal pain are reported. Erosion of external nares is an important physcial finding. Discharge is NOT responsive to antimicrobial treatment. Occlusal view radiographs of the nasal cavity may demonstrate evidence of turbinate destruction and/or increased fluid density on the affected side. Forty percent of patients are 3 years or younger; 80% are 7 years and younger. The diagnosis is uncommon in brachycephalic breeds. Localized Aspergillus fumigatus infection is reported most commonly. 4. Lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis: Poorly described clinical syndrome associated with chronic sneezing and nasal discharge (bilateral or unilateral). Affected dogs are typically young to middle-aged, large-breed dogs. Signs are NOT usually responsive to antibiotics or steroids (topical or systemic). Diagnosis is based on ruling out other causes and nasal biopsy.",

            "text": "The second most common clinical sign associated with upper respiratory disease in dogs, stertor refers to intermittent, yet persistent, or continuous snorting, also called stertorous breathing. Paroxysms of stertor, typically called reverse sneezing, characterize rapid, consecutive inspiratory bursts through the nose. Seldom actually seen during examination, reverse sneezing is likely to result from the patient's attempt to displace matter trapped in the nasopharynx and move it into the oropharynx, where it can be swallowed. Visualization of the nasopharynx and choana is essential in the patient that has chronic or persistent stertor. The examination can be accomplished only in the anesthetized patient. Sedation is NOT sufficient to conduct the examination. A flexible endoscope with the ability to flex approximately 170 to 180 degrees is recommended. Examination allows visualization of the nasopharynx and associated mucosa, the choana (posterior nares), and the top of the soft palate (see .Nasopharyngeal foreign bodies are by far the most common finding. Sticks, plant material (grass and juniper twigs), peas, cotton balls, and thread are just a few examples. Neoplasia is the second most common finding. In cats, lymphoma (feline leukemia virus-related) obstructing the choana most commonly is observed (see . In dogs, neoplasia is uncommon, but (in my experience) sarcomas in young dogs have been seen most frequently.",

            "text": "The least commonly encountered of the upper respiratory signs is stridor, or stridulous breathing. Stridor is audible wheezing and is associated with restriction to airflow, usually at the level of the larynx. Therefore stridor is the most critical and potentially life-threatening upper respiratory sign. This is especially true when stridor is continuous. The patient that has continuous stridor deserves immediate attention. Make every effort to discern the cause once the clinical sign is characterized. In obtaining the history, owners generally describe wheezing accurately; however, some patients actually may present for severe dyspnea or orthopnea. Careful questioning of the client is indicated to determine whether wheezing is associated with the additional effort to breath. The clinician also should make an effort to discern whether the owner has observed any change in the ability of the dog to vocalize or bark.Simply listening to the patient breath in a quiet room is the first step in assessing stridor. A stethoscope is not required to hear wheezing but should always be used to examine the cervical trachea, the larynx, and the lungs. Any restriction to airflow in the larynx or cervical trachea can cause stridor. However, in the majority of cases, the stridor will be significantly louder at the level of the larynx, indicating a restrictive lesion at that level.If any indication of respiratory distress is reported or is manifest during the examination, subject the patient to a visual examination under general anesthesia. Sedation is NOT sufficient to conduct the examination. Be prepared. These patients are NOT routine. Emergency resuscitation may be required on induction of anesthesia, including the need to perform a tracheostomy.On induction, carefully place an endotracheal tube. If there are no complications associated with inserting the tube, once anesthesia is effectively induced and the patient is stable, a lateral and dorsoventral radiographs of the larynx and cervical trachea are indicated. Metallic objects (e.g., fish hooks) can become buried in the mucosa and may not be observed during a visual examination.Remove the endotracheal tube in order to conduct a visual examination. A focal, handsfree light source directed into the oropharynx is strongly recommended. Carefully examine the epiglottis, arytenoid cartilages, glottis and vocal folds using a cotton-tipped applicator. Careful observation of the symmetry and function of the arytenoid cartilages is essential. The left and right cartilages normally respond to tactile stimuli when the patient is in a light plane of anesthesia; both sides should move to the medial plane rapidly and at the same time. They may not close, depending on the depth of anesthesia. It should be possible to visualize the cartilage on the inside of the tracheal rings while looking through the glottis.In large breed, middle-aged and older dogs, laryngeal paralysis is the most common cause of stridor. Associated signs may include exercise intolerance and collapse during exertion. Laryngeal paralysis and stridor also may be observed in young breeds as a congenital disorder (Dalmatian, Rottweiler, Bouvier des Flandres, Siberian Husky, and Bull Terrier). Foreign body penetration of the laryngeal tissues can cause serious and life-threatening obstruction because of infection and swelling. Neoplasia may cause obstructive mass lesions involving the larynx, especially squamous cell carcinoma and lymphoma. Granulomatous laryngeal disease and fungal mycetoma have been reported.The presence of a mass lesion, assuming there is no foreign body detected, warrants biopsy of the lesion. Additional effort to control postbiopsy bleeding is important. I use a cotton-tipped applicator saturated with a 1:10,000 dilution of epinephrine held against the biopsy site for 30 to 60 seconds. This is time well spent. Postbiopsy administration of systemically effective dexamethasone has been suggested to control laryngeal swelling, but I have not found this to be effective or important. ",

            "text": "Percutaneous aspiration needle biopsy can be helpful in establishing a diagnosis in conditions such as (l) chronic inflammatory disease of the lung-for example, granulomatous lung disease caused by mycotic organisms; (2) chronic inflammatory disease; (3) metastases to the lung; and (4) primary lung tumors. The biopsy may provide enough diagnostic information to preclude performing an exploratory thoracotomy. Lung biopsy is contraindicated in animals with hemorrhagic disease or thoracic disease that produces forceful breathing and coughing. Clip and surgically prepare the biopsy site. Infiltrate the skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and parietal pleura with 1% to 2% lidocaine.In diffuse parenchymal lung disease, taking biopsy material from the diaphragmatic lobes is recommended. The dorsal portions of the seventh to ninth intercostal spaces are preferred for percutaneous biopsies. In diffuse lesions, take biopsy material from the right or left thorax.Understanding of the risks associated with performing fine-needle aspiration of lung is important. Lung aspirates will yield only cells, fluid, and trace amounts of tissue, yet there is a significant risk of inducing pneumothorax following the procedure, even when performed without difficulty or complications.When performing the procedure, a 22-to 25-gauge disposable needle (such as a 1-inch spinal needle) with stylet is preferred. Leave the stylet within the needle until the lung has been penetrated. Then quickly remove the stylet and immediately attach a sterile 6-to 12-mL syringe. The amount of air that might enter the lung between the time the stylet is removed and the syringe attached is negligible. Holding the syringe carefully and steadily against the patient's thorax, establish negative pressure in the same manner as when obtaining an aspiration from a lymph node. As much as the patient will permit, attempt three to four aspirations without withdrawing the needle.Alternatively, insert a conventional 25-gauge needle, attached to a 6-mL syringe, subcutaneously over the area of interest. Then establish significant negative pressure while the tip of the needle is still positioned in the subcutaneous tissues outside the parietal pleura. While maintaining the same amount of negative pressure in the syringe, direct the needle into the lung, leave it in place for 1 to 2 seconds, and withdraw it completely. Apply any material collected directly to glass slide. This procedure is best conducted in patients that are awake. Attempting the procedure in anesthetized dogs or cats could result in an unsuccessful aspirate or, if the lungs were under positive pressure (ventilation or bagging), the risk of causing pneumothorax could be increased. Other reported complications include hemothorax (always exciting), lung laceration caused by patient movement during the procedure, pulmonary hemorrhage, and hemoptysis. Contraindications to fineneedle aspiration include patients with a known bleeding diathesis and coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, uncontrolled coughing, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary cysts, and bullous emphysema.Ultrasound guided techniques for fine-needle aspiration or biopsy of lung recently have been described and generally are associated with fewer procedural complications. However, additional training and experience, in addition to having access to the proper size and type of ultrasound probe, is critical.",

            "text": "Inhalation therapy can be defined as nebulization (humidification of the inspired air) and aerosol therapy (the process whereby drugs are vaporized in a solution and delivered directly into the respiratory tract). In companion animals, inhalation therapy is most useful for humidifying air in the respiratory tract and moistening the mucous membranes (nebulization). Sustained inspiration of dry air/gases causes irritation to the respiratory epithelium, which in turn results in swelling, bronchial gland hypertrophy, goblet cell proliferation, and loss of ciliary epithelium over time. Respiratory secretions become thick and tenacious, and efficient bronchial drainage is impaired. The objectives of inhalation therapy include the following: 1. Humidification of bronchial mucous membranes 2. Deposition of miniscule amounts of potent drugs in smaller airways to obtain optimal topical therapeutic effects with minimal systemic side effects (e.g., bronchodilators) 3. Deposition of moderate amounts of potent agents or agents that are only effective topically (e.g., antibiotics and mucolytics) 4. Deposition of relatively large quantities of bland substances that promote bronchial drainage with minimal irritation (e.g., saline, propylene glycol, glycerine, and detergents) Nebulization is used (l) in combination with oxygen therapy; (2) in tracheostomy care; (3) in acute respiratory diseases such as tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, upper respiratory disease of cats, pneumonia, and postoperative atelectasis and pneumonia; and (4) in chronic respiratory diseases such as chronic bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, collapsed trachea with secondary tracheobronchitis, emphysema, and bronchiectasis.Aerosol therapy, however, is a limited-use therapeutic technique used in dogs and cats to administer antimicrobials, bronchodilators (aminophylline, 100 mg), or corticosteroids. The advantage of doing so is to achieve relatively high levels of drug in the respiratory tract in patients with defined lower respiratory tract disease. In addition, administration of potentially toxic antimicrobials (aminoglycosides) by this route has been shown to be associated with minimal or insignificant uptake into the general circulation, thereby minimizing (or eliminating) any risk of renal toxicity.",

Particles smaller than 10 \u00b5m (2 to 10 \u00b5m) are deposited in the bronchi, but only the smallest particles reach the bronchioles. Ultrasonic aerosol generators are the most effective machines for nebulization. The mists can be directed into a cage or a face mask. If nebulization is used with an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube, warm inspired gases to body temperature.Dense mist from an unheated jet nebulizer (Figure 4 -58) contains only slightly more water than is needed to humidify air with temperature increasing from 22\u00b0to 37\u00b0C. Evaporation of the aerosol solution can be prevented by stabilization; that is, by heating it to 35\u00b0C or by reducing the vapor pressure by adding 10% propylene glycol. Because distilled water and hypertonic solutions are irritating to the mucosa, use only isotonic or half-strength isotonic saline. Although continuous, low-level humidification of the oxygen tent atmosphere is necessary, periodic medication by aerosol spray is permissible. High levels of water can be introduced several times daily for 10 to 15 minutes per treatment, or drugs can be added to the solution during these times. Many drugs have been used; isoproterenol, epinephrine, and phenylephrine are some of the drugs that may cause bronchodilation and decreased airway resistance. ",

The next step, of course, is abdominal surgery. I recommend avoiding cystocentesis whenever possible.
