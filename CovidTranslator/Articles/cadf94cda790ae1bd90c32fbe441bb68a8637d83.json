These hotlines have struggled with the volume of callers, leading to wait times of hours or, even, an inability to contact health authorities. Symptoma is a symptom-to-disease digital health assistant that can differentiate more than 20,000 diseases with an accuracy of more than 90%. We tested the accuracy of Symptoma to identify COVID-19 using a set of diverse clinical cases combined with case reports of COVID-19. We showed that Symptoma can accurately distinguish COVID-19 in 96.32% of clinical cases. When considering only COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors, Symptoma identified 100% of those infected when presented with only three signs. Lastly, we showed that Symptoma's accuracy far exceeds that of simple \"yes-no\" questionnaires widely available online. In summary, Symptoma provides unparalleled accuracy in systematically identifying cases of COVID-19 while also considering over 20,000 other diseases. Furthermore, Symptoma allows free text input, furthered with disease-specific follow up questions, in 36 languages. Combined, these results and accessibility give Symptoma the potential to be a key tool in the global fight against COVID-19. The Symptoma predictor is freely available online at https://www.",

To track and hopefully curb this pandemic, large-scale laboratory testing for COVID-19 is becoming widespread. However, capacities are far from being able to test whole populations. Therefore many countries have established phone hotlines to pre-screen persons who are unsure about their COVID-19 infection status. Only after talking to an operator and being identified as a potential case, often due to being symptomatic, will laboratory testing occur. However, these hotlines are severely overrun worldwide, leading to hour-long waiting periods and, even, disconnected lines. This ultimately leads to many COVID-19 cases going undiagnosed.",

They do not provide a deep understanding of a patient's health situation, they do not allow for the consideration of additional symptoms, they do not allow the generation of additional data for analysis, and, critically, they are often language-and/or country-specific.",

Achieving 100% sensitivity is however easy e.g. by constructing a test that simply classifies every case as COVID-19. To address this issue we also tested how well Symptoma performs on cases of non-COVID-19 patients. For this purpose, we use 1,112 British Medical Journal (BMJ) cases that stretch over 84 fields of medicine (see Methods). Of these 1,112 cases, only 41 are classified as potential COVID-19 cases by Symptoma, with only seven of these ranking COVID-19 higher than the correct diagnoses. These seven cases relate to diseases that present similarly to COVID-19, however, have far lower incidence rates and, therefore, are deemed less likely, e.g. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) or the Avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection (bird flu). The results are summarized in Table 1 . ",

This threshold is passed by 75%, 98.5%, and 100% of one, two, and three symptom queries respectively. At three symptoms, 99.1% of the possible combinations are returned within the top 10 results, and with four symptoms, all queries return COVID-19 within the top 10.

We showed that Symptoma is superior to these alternative approaches in multiple aspects. First, Symptoma can correctly identify cases of COVID-19, not only against a few diseases but against more than 20,000 other potential causes. This far exceeds the 6,000 differential diagnoses provided by the second-largest symptom checker \"Isabel Healthcare\" 3 . Secondly, we showed that Symptoma needs only a few symptoms to highlight cases of COVID-19. Crucially, these can be inputted as free text that is semantically understood. For example, if one enters \"Tiramisu\", \"Food Poisoning\" is returned as one of the top results. In contrast, other COVID-19 questionnaires and symptom checkers require that patients only select from a predefined list of symptoms or are constrained to fixed questions. Furthermore, Symptoma is localised into 36 languages, allowing a standardised approach on disease predictions globally. Lastly, we found that Symptoma performs better than simple questionnaire-based approached in identifying COVID-19 cases, even though these alternative approaches only considered three alternative diagnoses (COVID-19, influenza, common cold, and hay fever). Moreover, as Symptoma is constantly mining the newest literature, it keeps up-to-date with the latest knowledge and alters its predictions accordingly, e.g. the recent reports on anosmia in COVID-19 patients 4, 5 . Similarly, by tracking cases of Covid-19 entered into Symptoma, due to the free-text function, new symptoms related to Covid-19 may be highlighted. On these grounds, we believe that Symptoma is a highly valuable tool in the global COVID-19 crisis.",

Normalisation yields the respective probabilities. In the second approach, the same procedure is used, but the distance in space is normalised by the respective standard deviation of each symptom across all diseases (SF-SD). In the third approach, each symptom frequency is weighted by the first principal component of a matrix consisting of all symptoms across all diseases (SF-PCA). Lastly, we interpreted the points as vectors and calculated the cosine similarity between the cases and diseases (SF-COS).",
