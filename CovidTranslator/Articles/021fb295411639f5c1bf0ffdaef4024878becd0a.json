Most agricultural production traits such as body weight or milk yield are quantitative: for any given trait there is a continuous range of values that are represented in each population. Although individual traits show only modest rates of response to selection (0.5-3.0% per year), the changes are permanent, cumulative and can, over many years, achieve large increases in production efficiency (TABLE 1) . For example, continuous selection for growth rate in chickens bred for their meat has produced birds that are now four times heavier than those bred to lay eggs 9 . However, simple selection for the improvement of one specific trait is uncommon: several traits are usually combined into an overall economic merit SELECTION INDEX 10 . Sophisticated statistical and computing tools now enhance conventional genetic selection, nevertheless traits such as fertility and disease resistance remain difficult to measure and improve.",

Unfortunately, phenotype is an imperfect predictor of the breeding value of an individual because, for example, it could be gender specific or manifest after the selection phase (the age at which selection decisions are made) in the breeding life of an animal. Also, phenotype is poor at resolving negative associations between genes that are caused, for example, by epistasis, in which the activity of one gene locus is negatively modulated by another. Selection on the basis of DNA markers offers a way round some of these limitations, as DNA markers can be tested at any age and can be measured in either gender.",

The idea behind this was that it would allow selection on the basis of an animal's genotype rather than its phenotype -a process known as marker-assisted selection 11 . This was seen as a prelude to isolating the genes that underpin quantitative traits. The initial low-resolution maps 12 that are available, with one marker per million bases, are now being refined by breeding studies 13, 14 .

We contrast transgenic strategies that have been used to improve performance with the tried and tested selective breeding regimes that have been used during the past 70 years. We propose that two recent developments are set to stimulate a resurgence of interest in the generation and use of transgenic livestock. First, lentivirus vectors offer the possibility of producing transgenic livestock far more efficiently and cost effectively 5, 6 . Second, by combining the use of these new vectors with the rapidly developing methods that are based on RNA interference (RNAi) to suppress the expression of specific genes 7, 8 , we anticipate the development of innovative techniques that will further our understanding of gene function in livestock species and potentially generate farm animals that are less susceptible to infectious disease.",

By contrast, initial attempts to apply the same approaches in livestock were not as successful. Transgenic pigs carrying human growth crosses. For example, a cross between Chinese Meishan and European Large White pigs, which show marked differences in their fatness and litter size, has been used to search for pig QTLs 16 . However, although it was shown that QTLs could be identified in farm animals, it was predicted that QTLs such as those for fatness and litter size would have already been fixed for the desirable alleles in breeding populations and so there would be no variation for the breeder to select 17 . Interestingly, some QTLs that have been identified, including the fat QTL on pig chromosome 4 (REF. 17 ), These initial mapping efforts initiated a more widespread hunt for the QTLs that underpin agricultural traits. Initially there was an intense debate about how useful this would be, because conventional genetic selection assumes that an infinite number of unlinked genes that have small effects control the production traits 15 . The problem was that to identify QTLs, the genes that underlie them must have moderate or large effects. Initial QTL mapping efforts used experimental crosses between breeds that were known to show large phenotypic differences -so-called 'extreme' First transgenic livestock produced 1 .",

One such use was the expression of proteins with potential therapeutic applications in the milk of livestock species, with a view to developing these transgenic livestock as 'biopharms' [24] [25] [26] . In some cases very high levels of expression have been achieved. For example 'Tracy' the transgenic sheep produced more than 30 g/l of human protease inhibitor \u03b11-antitrypsin in her milk 27 . Large amounts of this protein are needed to treat people who have emphysema and can potentially alleviate some of the symptoms that are associated with cystic fibrosis, and large-scale expression by transgenic biopharms is perhaps the only way \u03b11-antitrypsin can be produced cost effectively (see also the article by Ma et al. in this issue). Nevertheless, even though this use of transgenic livestock has been in development for over a decade, at present only one protein (antithrombin-III) produced in this way is in late clinical trials. Although the biopharming approach seems feasible, the financial commitment required during the protracted development phase has halted many attempts at commercial exploitation. Over the past few years several commercial ventures have withdrawn from transgenic biopharming for various, usually financial, reasons. So, even though much of the groundwork has been done it is unclear what the future holds for this use of transgenic livestock.",

A worldwide shortage of donor organs for transplant surgery chanelled the enthusiasm for transgenic research into ways of allowing transplantation between species (xenotranplantation). As the pig shares several anatomical and physiological features with humans it became the focus of much of this research. However, pig tissues are immunologically incompatible with humans: pig xenotransplants provoke a rapid, COMPLEMENT-based HYPERACUTE REJECTION (HAR) response that destroys the transplanted tissue 28 . Several transgenic approaches have been developed to overcome this rejection, including the production of transgenic pigs expressing human decay accelerating factor (DAF) to reduce complement activity by restricting complement 3/complement 5 activation 29 . However, serious concerns were raised about the safety of xenotransplantation when it was shown that pig RETROVIRUSES could jump species and replicate in human cells 30 strategy in the future 43 . Another problem is that the stringent selection and extended in vitro culture that are required for targeting somatic cells might reduce their developmental potential 44 , which compounds the low efficiency of nuclear transfer. Furthermore, to achieve the phenotype both alleles must be deleted. At present, it is only possible to target one gene in vitro and so homozygous nulls must be generated by crossing independently generated male and female clones, or by retargeting and recloning. Recently, the generation of piglets with both copies of the \u03b1(1,3)galactosyltransferase gene knocked out has been described 45 , but, unexpectedly, homozygous knockout pig fibroblasts generated by another research group seem to express low levels of the gal antigen 46 .",

This technology is now very sophisticated: genes can be knocked out in specific tissues 35 and single-base-pair mutations can be introduced into a selected gene 36 . Endogenous genes are targeted by homologous recombination in totipotent embryonic stem (ES) cells in culture. These cells are then reintroduced into the early embryo to colonize the tissues of the developing mouse (FIG. 1b) . In a proportion of these mice the gene is knocked out in the germline and breeding from these will easily produce mouse strains that carry the knockout allele. Unfortunately, despite intensive efforts, this technology is limited to the mouse, as no germline-competent ES cells have been described for any other mammalian species 37 . The reason for this lack of success is unclear and certainly does not reflect the efforts that have been directed towards this goal for over a decade. In some quarters there is hope that by using the experiences gained from the isolation and maintenance of human ES cells new efforts to generate ruminant ES cells might be more productive. Subsequently the RISC degrades the target mRNA 57 . These siRNAs are too small to activate the mammalian interferon-mediated antiviral response that is associated with long dsRNAs, although this matter is now the subject of debate [58] [59] [60] . This technique has been used to functionally analyse genes in mammalian cells [61] [62] [63] .

However, safety issues, problems with transgene expression and the constraint that oncoretroviruses only integrate into dividing cells have limited the development of this type of retroviral vector. More recently there has been considerable interest in developing REPLICATION-DEFECTIVE lentiviruses (a specialized retrovirus) as vectors (BOX 1) for gene-therapy applications 54,55 , as they seem to overcome some of these limitations. Two groups recently showed that these lentivectors can efficiently introduce foreign DNA into the mouse germline 5,6 . This approach is so efficient (partially owing to the inherent ability of lentiviral DNA to integrate into the genome without a requirement for host-cell DNA replication) that 80-100% of the mouse pups born were transgenic. There is no reason why these efficiencies will not be the same for livestock. To put this in context, in previous studies using pronuclear injection about 70 sheep were required to make just 1 transgenic founder 56 . By contrast, using lentivectors in combination with in vitro matured and fertilized oocytes, we estimate that as few as five animals will be required! Versatile vectors that are able to infect many vertebrate species can be generated through appropriate PSEUDOTYPING, for example, with vesicular stomatis virus G (VSV-G). So, these should be applicable to livestock species. An even more appealing aspect of these new vectors is the simplicity of their delivery. Lentivectors can be delivered by injection into the PERIVITELLINE SPACE of the fertilized egg or, after removal of the ZONA PELLUCIDA, by simply incubating DENUDED EGGS in a viral solution 5, 6 . So, no specialized equipment is required, which would be another big advantage of developing the same technology for livestock species.",

Members of this group of viruses include the Visna/maedi virus of sheep, equine infectious anaemia virus (AIEV) of horses and the immunodeficiency viruses of cattle, cats and man (BIV, FIV and HIV, respectively). Like other retroviruses, lentiviruses target their host cells through their envelope proteins. They fuse with the cell membrane, and when the viral RNA is in the cytoplasm it is converted through a virus-contained reverse-transcriptase polymerase into a DNA intermediate. This DNA molecule then integrates into the host-cell genome through its long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences. A distinguishing property of lentiviruses is their ability to infect both dividing and non-dividing cells. It is this property that has promoted their development as gene-delivery vectors that are known as lentivectors. Lentivectors 52,82,83 have been generated by the deletion of key genes that are involved in the packaging and replication of the virus from the viral genome. Only the introduction of vector DNA into a packaging cell line that has been engineered by transfection strategies to express the missing genes can produce the vector particles. For safety reasons, it is desirable to introduce into the packaging cell line each missing gene as a seperate construct, thereby reducing the likelihood of recombination events that could restore replication-competent vectors. A key feature is that the vector is otherwise transcriptionally silent and so does not activate endogenous genes that are near the site of vector integration. This is achieved by introducing mutations into the viral genome transcription control sequences to generate a self-inactivating (SIN) vector. Overall, there is a drive to reduce the number of viral sequences that are present in these vectors to further increase their safety by limiting the potential for recombination with wild-type virus."

Nevertheless, this approach will be very useful in evaluating the function of known genes and candidate genes that are identified from gene-mapping studies. However, it is unlikely that this approach will be used for livestock improvement in the near future. It will take both a better understanding of the genomes of livestock, with the anticipated increase in candidate genes to choose from, and a major practical success before transgenic technology seriously challenges genetic improvement of livestock through selection for most conventional traits.",

Lentivectors could be used to generate gain-or loss-of-function phenotypes in livestock. In light of the developments in RNAi technology, we have focused our discussion on the loss-offunction applications in livestock. There are several target genes that if knocked down might be expected to enhance production traits. For example, knockdown of myostatin, which is known to inhibit lean-muscle growth 70, 71 , could be achieved in cattle. Furthermore, after nearly 20 years work modifying the mouse genome there is now a wealth of candidate genes, the modulation of which might be expected to affect production traits in livestock. For example, deletion of the highgrowth gene, identified as Socs2 (REF. 72 ), is known to generate mice with increased postnatal growth. The deletion of Socs1 in mice enhances mammary gland development 73 and, therefore, possibly milk production. As well as knocking down genes that are known to be related to production characteristics, it is also anticipated that QTL research in livestock will require the use of transgenic knockdown technology to confirm candidate gene function.",

This is based on a phenomenon that has been recognized for some time as a principal mechanism of post-transcriptional gene silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophilia and plants 8 . This process relies on small interfering (si)RNAs that typically consist of two 19-23 nucleotide (nt) single-stranded RNAs that are able to form a 19-bp duplex with 3\u2032-overhangs (see figure, part a) . siRNAs can be generated from long double-stranded (ds)RNA by a complex that includes the enzyme Dicer 7 (see figure, part b) . Sequence-specific mRNA degradation occurs in protein-RNA complexes that are known as RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) 57 (see figure, part c). As an experimental tool siRNAs can be synthesized and administered to target cells in culture by transfection. This is extremely efficient and 90% knockdown can be achieved. Alternatively, stable expression can be achieved through the use of a polymerase-III promoter vector that directs expression of short hairpin (sh)RNA 65, 66 . In shRNAs, two 19-nucleotide strands of an active siRNA are linked together by a few (~9) nucleotides. This structure is engineered downstream of polymerase-III promotor and upstream of a run of 5 T-residues. Transcription from the polymerase-III promoter gives rise to an shRNA terminated after the second U to generate a 2-bp UU overhang at the 3\u2032 end. This molecule is processed by Dicer to function as an siRNA and the antisense strand is used by RISC to guide sequence-specific mRNA cleavage, so promoting mRNA degradation (see figure, part c).",

In livestock, an exception to this is farmed fish, for which there are substantial and much debated risks of gene flow to wild populations 86, 87 .",

            "text": "In Europe, GM issues revolve around need and trust, and there are several nongovernmental organizations leading the anti-GM debate. By contrast, there has been a greater tendency to accept GM in the United States, and in many developing countries it is issues relating to trade that are often uppermost in the public's mind. There are also keenly held ethical views about GM animals. Many people accept the benefits of using transgenic animals for the production of human therapeutic proteins, although this view is by no means universal. By contrast (and in Europe particularly), even if GM could deliver improvements in animal productivity, such as feed efficiency or food quality, this use of the technology might not be politically acceptable because of public concerns about GM organisms. Given this backdrop, if it does become possible to create GM animals that are innately resistant to diseases, such as foot and mouth or swine fever, it is difficult to gauge what the future attitude of the consumer would be. This will be a debate in commercially this could be seen as an advantage as many lines will be generated from each founder animal. Lentivectors can only transport a limited amount of genetic material, probably less than 10kb. This might limit the size of transcriptional promoter and/or coding sequence that can be incorporated, and this raises issues about the level and specificity The efficiency of interference with viral replication/transcription can be tested in cell culture (c) before injecting the particles into the perivitelline space of a fertilized egg (d). After in vitro culture the infected early stage embryos are transferred into recipients. After gestation, founder transgenic animals are born (e) and they can be tested for resistance.",
