This acknowledgement is a consequence of improvement in diagnosis and better understanding of transmission. Available vaccines and antiviral drugs for prophylaxis and treatment have been developed accordingly. Viral respiratory pathogens are increasingly recognized as nosocomial pathogens as well. The purpose of this review is to describe the most frequent and relevant nosocomial viral respiratory infections, their mechanisms of transmission and the infection control measures to prevent their spread in the healthcare setting. Recent findings Although most mechanisms of transmission and control measures of nosocomial viral infections are already known, improved diagnostic tools allow better characterization of these infections and also lead to the discovery of new viruses such as the coronavirus, which is the cause of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or the human bocavirus. Also, the ability to understand better the impact, dissemination and prevention of these viruses, allows us to improve the measures to prevent these infections. Summary Healthcare viral respiratory infections increase patient morbidity. Each virus has a different mechanism of transmission; therefore, early detection and prompt implementation of infection control measures are very important in order to avoid their transmission in the hospital setting.",

There are five HCoV identified as HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-SARS. The latter virus was responsible of an epidemic of severe respiratory disease syndrome in some countries in Asia (China, Hong Kong SAR, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam) and Canada in 2003, with approximately 10% mortality and high attack rate in healthcare workers and family members; it was detected in humans for the last time in 2004 [19, 20] . More recently, one coronavirus was able to cause severe respiratory disease in humans in the middle east. This coronavirus was named as MERS-CoV and was isolated in Saudi Arabia in 2012 from respiratory secretions in a man who died from pneumonia. This finding, combined with a retrospective assessment of stored samples from an outbreak observed in healthcare workers in Jordan, allowed the recognition of MERS-CoV as a cause of this new severe respiratory disease [21\u2022 ]. The origin of MERS-CoV has been widely debated. It was originally believed that the reservoir was bats due to the similarity between MERS-CoV and bat coronavirus. However, the strain found in humans was not related to the one described in bats. Another possible source for this type of coronavirus is the camel because they have antibodies against MERS-CoV similar to those found in humans. Most human cases of MERS-CoV were described in Saudi Arabia and, to a lesser degree, in the United Arabs Emirates. Later on, other cases outside the Arabian Peninsula were notified, but all of them were imported from endemic countries in the Middle East, and were related to close contact with sick people. Most of the patients were healthy males around 50 years [22] .",

It has also been reported in stool and blood of immunosuppressed hosts [13] .",

The size of droplets, produced by coughing, sneezing or any other procedure that moves respiratory secretions, is larger than 5 \u03bcm. Recent data has demonstrated the transmission of RSV through aerosolized particles based on the fact that they appear close to hospitalized children with bronchiolitis and RSV infections. These particles can remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods of time and can infect human epithelial cells [26] . The survival of RSV in the environment seems to be partly dependent on drying time and dew point. At room temperature RSV in patients' secretions can be viable on polished surfaces for 3 to 30 h. On porous surfaces such as cloth or tissue papers viability is shorter, usually less than an hour. Viral infectivity in the hands varies from person to person, generally less than an hour [27] . The risk of transmission is not the same in all the hospital areas: in pediatric and neonatal units, risk of transmission occurs between 6% and 56%, in transplant and oncohematological units fluctuates between 6% and 12%, and in other adult wards between 30% and 32% [28] . It must also be considered that healthcare workers can be a source of transmission for RSV, considering that shedding occurs between 15% to 20% of them, even without symptoms [29] .",

In closed areas with high risk patients, such as bone marrow transplant units about 50% of the infections come from healthcare personnel or infected visitors [33\u2022] . Another source of nosocomial transmission of influenza are hospitalized patients with prolonged viral shedding, sometimes for weeks or months. High risk patients for prolonged shedding include those under high doses of steroids, oncohematological patients and children [13, 28, 32] . Another potential source of transmission at the hospital are those individuals not yet symptomatic, but within 1-3 days prior the infection. These cases are difficult to detect, and hence, preventive control measures are usually not implemented [34] . Different studies show that healthcare workers are one of the main vehicles of transmission of influenza within the hospital. There is data showing that many of them continue to work being ill, which certainly amplifies the rate of transmission [35] .",

Use of facemask (droplet precautions) and goggles when direct contact with the patient are also recommended by others (Table 2 ) [29, 47] . Eye protection should always be worn when performing procedures that might generate sprays from respiratory secretions, considering that nose and eyes are the main sites for virus inoculation [2, 47] . CDC also recommends that infected patients be hospitalized in single rooms or kept in cohort isolation if no individual isolation rooms are available. When cohorting, there should be at least 0.9 m of separation between beds [2] . Another measure to be considered is the use of individual equipment for each patient, including toys. Other strategies that help prevent RSV transmission in the healthcare setting include: reducing the quantity of persons in contact with hospitalized patients (especially oncohematological), avoiding the presence of children under 12 years of age in the hospital when RSV circulates either in the community or the hospital, and using single-bed rooms for infected patients [2, 29, 48] . Some studies have demonstrated that healthcare workers use of eye protection might more efficient than contact precautions in decreasing the risk of RSV transmission within the hospital setting [28] . Other recommendations, with very little or no evidence at all, suggest that healthcare personnel caring for RSV infected patients be exclusive for these individuals and that hospital visitor restrictions be taken during RSV season. The use of drugs for prophylaxis is limited to palivizumab in the high risk pediatric population although there are some data that demonstrates its effectiveness in the prevention of RSV in HSCT adult patients [13, [49] [50] [51] .

            "text": "Annual influenza vaccination of healthcare workers and high-risk patients for influenza complications and their households is the most effective measure to prevent the disease and its complications. It also contributes to decrease viral transmission in the healthcare setting [2] . Vaccination of healthcare workers is the second most important strategy, just behind handwashing, to prevent nosocomial dissemination of influenza [41\u2022\u2022] . Several studies have demonstrated a reduction in morbidity and mortality among patients in different healthcare settings when healthcare workers have been vaccinated against influenza [41\u2022\u2022] . Different strategies were successfully implemented in order to increase vaccine uptake in healthcare personnel. Among these were educational campaigns regarding benefits of the vaccine for patients and personnel, actions addressed to remove administrative barriers for vaccination, implementation of accessible locations for vaccine administration and of signed declination statements, and mandatory vaccination policies for healthcare workers [52] . However, the scientific support for this last strategy has been questioned recently [53] . Antivirals against influenza have proved effective to reduce influenza viral transmission. The ones now available are the neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir. Oseltamivir which is administered through the oral route has proved to effectively prevent secondary cases of influenza among household contacts if it is given within 48 h of symptoms initiation of the index case. Zanamivir, which is administered by inhalation per mouth, has also proved effective in preventing secondary influenza cases in households and healthcare workers [54, 55] , but caution is advised, as its efficacy has only been demonstrated in particular circumstances. During a nosocomial outbreak, in high-risk patients and non-vaccinated healthcare workers, antiviral administration should be implemented. When a mismatch between the circulating influenza strain and the vaccine strain is identified, antiviral prophylaxis should be given to all healthcare workers if an outbreak occurs. Duration of antiviral administration during a nosocomial outbreak of influenza should be two weeks or one week after the outbreak control [2] . Besides vaccination and antivirals, infection control measures are of utmost importance in order to prevent influenza virus transmission and dissemination in the hospital environment. These measures include handwashing, limitation of visitors and of health personnel in contact with infected patients, cohort or single bed rooms isolation, and droplet precautions. Precautions to avoid aerosolization should also be implemented in case of a new pandemic strain or when performing high risk procedures (e.g. intubation) ( Table 2 ) [13] .",
