The development of rapid screening assays is essential for antiviral drug discovery. By using a cell line expressing a SARS-CoV subgenomic replicon, we developed a high-throughput assay and used it to screen small molecule compounds for inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication in the absence of live virus. The assay system involves minimal manipulation after assay set-up, facilitates automated read-out and minimizes risks associated with hazardous viruses. Based on this assay system, we screened 7035 small molecule compounds from which we identified 7 compounds with anti-SARS-CoV activity. We demonstrate that the compounds inhibited SARS-CoV replication-dependent GFP expression in the replicon cells and reduced SARS-CoV viral protein accumulation and viral RNA copy number in the replicon cells. In a SARS-CoV plaque reduction assay, these compounds were confirmed to have antiviral activity. The target of one of the hit compounds, C12344, was validated by the generation of resistant replicon cells and the identification of the mutations conferring the resistant phenotype. These compounds should be valuable for developing anti-SARS therapeutic drugs as well as research tools to study the mechanism of SARS-CoV replication.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV drug discovery requires the development of reliable biological assays. Traditional antiviral assays for coronavirus are based on viral infection of cultured cells, followed by monitoring of compound inhibition of viral replication through observation of cytopathic effects, quantification of viral yields by plaque assay, or measurement of viral RNA by reverse transcription-PCR (Ivens et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2004) . The virus can infect many cell types and produces plaques (Hofmann and P\u00f6hlmann, 2004) . However, the requirement that infectious virus work be carried out under Biosafety Level 3 conditions makes it more difficult to use live virus assays in high-throughput screening (HTS) to identify antiviral compounds. The low-throughput nature of these assays limits their use for the screening of compound libraries. The availability of reverse genetic systems for many coronavirus (cDNA clones for infectious full-length genomes and for subgenomic replicons) has made it possible to develop novel assays for HTS (Thiel et al., 2003b; Yount et al., 2000 Yount et al., , 2003 . In principle, a reporter gene such as GFP could be engineered into a full-length virus and into a subgenomic replicon. Infection or transfection of susceptible cells with such a reporting virus or replicon results in the expression of GFP. The level of GFP fluorescence would reflect the extent of viral replication and could be used to monitor the suppression of viral infection by potential inhibitors (Ge et al., 2007; Hertzig et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "We have recently described a cell line (SCR-1) that stably expresses a SARS-CoV replicon that encodes a GFP reporter gene and a blasticidin-resistant gene (Fig. 1A) . It allows viral replication to be monitored by simply measuring the fluorescence intensity in the cells. To adapt a GFP-expressing replicon cell line (SCR-1) into an HTS assay, we initially determined a linear range of reporting cells for seeding of the 96-well plates. Selection of an appropriate cell number per well is critical because cell density could affect the replication efficiency of the replicon, and analysis of inhibitors requires quantification of a decrease in the steady-state level of replicon RNA. To examine the effects of cell density, SCR-1 cells were seeded at densities ranging from 5000 to 60,000 cells/well. The fluorescence signal correlated closely with cell number (Fig. 1B) . We were able to consistently produced easily measurable fluorescence signals at a density of 30,000 cells/well, so this density was selected for the HTS assay. Furthermore, at this density the cells did not become overly confluent during the assay, a condition in which replicon copy number might be adversely affected (Pietschmann et al., 2001) . We next examined the effect of cell passage on fluorescence intensity and showed that the activity was stable for at least 10 passages (data not shown). All HTS assays were performed with cells that were within 5 passages from the original frozen stocks (passage 25-30 from colony selection). The impact of DMSO concentration was also examined; the results revealed that the cells tolerated 0.5% DMSO, but there was a slight decrease in the fluorescence signal when 2% DMSO was used (data not shown). Therefore, in the HTS assay the DMSO concentration was limited to 0.5%. Under this experimental condition, the assay window (GFP fluorescence signal from replicon-bearing cells divided by the background signal from na\u00efve BHK-21 cells) consistently ranged from 1 \u00d7 10 4 to 1 \u00d7 10 5 (data not shown). The results suggest that the replicon-containing cell line could be used in an HTS assay.",

The same blots were stripped and probed for beta-actin to show equal loading. As shown in Fig. 3B , all of the compounds had minimal effect on the beta-actin level, which is consistent with the MTT data showing that these compounds are not cytotoxic at the 10 M concentration used. The Western blot data demonstrate that the tested compounds all reduced SARS-CoV nsp5 protein level in replicon cells after 48 h drug treatment. Dose dependency is also clearly seen with several compounds, e.g. C12344 and C26505 (structures shown in Table 1 ). However, a few compounds reduced viral protein only at 10 M, the highest concentration used. Examples include C03455 and C11472 (Table 1) . Comparison of these Western blot data with the IC50 data determined with the FACS assay, demonstrated a reasonably good correlation between fluorescence reduction and viral protein reduction.

For cells recovered in the presence of antiviral agents, the nucleotide sequences of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro cDNA were determined after RNA extraction and RT-PCR, as described previously (Ge et al., 2007) . Two resistance variations against C12344 were identified to be substitutions of Lys61 with Ile (K61I) and Asn119 with His (N119H).

The remaining three compounds are chemically attractive (chemically stable, non-reactive, and easy to synthesize derivatives) and appear to be well suited for further analysis. Most importantly, all these compounds inhibited SARS-CoV viral production in live virus infection assays. All these compounds show a potential for further optimization into potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV and merit detailed characterization regarding mechanism of action. At present, only the target of C12344 has been validated by the generation of resistant replicon cells and the identification of the mutations conferring the drug-resistant phenotype, the mechanisms of action for the remaining six candidate compounds are not known. Whether the compounds are targeting a viral protein or a cellular process that is involved in SARS-CoV replication is not clear. To assess some of these aspects in vitro, we are establishing SARS-CoV 3CL pro and helicase assays to investigate whether the compounds can inhibit these enzymatic activities. At the same time, we are attempting to develop virus resistance to these candidates in order to find out whether a specific viral protein is targeted by their action.",

We demonstrated that such resistant variations have been selected in vitro against the SARS-CoV 3CL pro specific inhibitor C12433. Therefore, despite the potent anti-SARS-CoV activity of C12433 demonstrated in the replicon cells, the optimal therapy could still involve the combination of C12433 with other antiviral agents. This has been best illustrated with the treatment for HIV, where the combination of three or more drugs of various mechanisms is absolutely necessary to continuously suppress viral replication and the emergence of resistance. In future, we will examine whether the effect of the combination of several drugs was additive or synergistic. Also we are going to investigate whether incubation of the replicon cells with a combination of several drugs would help suppress the emergence of these in vitro resistance variations against C12433.",

            "text": "In conclusion, this report describes a robust screening system for identification of drug candidates selectively active against SARS-CoV. This screening system meets the requirements of a successful high-throughput assay such as minimal manipulation after assay set-up, low sample volume and automated detection of endpoint. This system offers considerable benefits from a first round of screening regarding selectivity, specificity and toxicity of the compound, resulting in an improved data set from an initial screen in comparison with existing assays based on simpler observation such as plaque formation or analysis of CPE. This system, with its ease of handling and good level of safety is well suited to drug discovery against the SARS-CoV, and should be applicable to other emerging high-risk pathogenic viruses. Furthermore, the compounds we have identified may be useful research tools in dissecting the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV replication and viral host interaction.",
