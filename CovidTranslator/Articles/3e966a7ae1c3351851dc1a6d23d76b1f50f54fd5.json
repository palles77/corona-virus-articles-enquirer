Subtle signal deviations caused by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can also be detected but is challenged by a high AT content (81%) in P. falciparum. We compared genome-wide CGH signal to sequence polymorphisms between parasite strains 3D7, HB3, and Dd2 using NimbleGen microarrays. From 23,191 SNPs (excluding var/rif/stevor genes), our CGH probe set detected SNPs with > 99.9% specificity but low (< 10%) sensitivity. Probe length, melting temperature, GC content, SNP location in the probe, mutation type, and hairpin structures affected SNP sensitivity. Previously unrecognized variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) also were detected by this method. These findings will guide the redesign of a probe set to optimize an openly available CGH microarray platform for high resolution genotyping suitable for population genomics studies.",

CGH microarrays readily detect copy number polymorphisms (CNPs), such as segmental amplifications or deletions and also have potential for direct allelic variation scanning as first demonstrated in yeast [4] . Sequence polymorphisms in target gDNA cause less efficient hybridization to the microarray probe (relative to a perfectly matched reference sample) creating a detectable difference in hybridization signal intensity. This signal intensity is affected by the number and location of mismatches between the target and probe sequence. These signal variations point to locations in the genome associated with polymorphisms purely on the basis of hybridization kinetics. Hybridization signal-based detection of \"single feature polymorphisms\" (SFPs) can indicate the presence of a variant but can not explicitly identify the polymorphism without using probes targeted to specific alleles.",

SFPs were characterized further using a redesigned chip that effectively resequenced the polymorphic positions. This approach was sensitive enough to identify specific point mutations that occurred during several rounds of increasing metronidazole pressure which were associated with hyper-resistance to this bactericidal compound. Yeast tiling microarrays have been used for genome-wide SNP discovery without relying on allele-specific probes [6] . The tiled probes provide redundant coverage for any given nucleotide allowing the location of the polymorphism to be reliably mapped to a range of a few nucleotides. This approach allowed the detection of > 90% of the 30,303 known SNPs between two yeast strains. Furthermore, chip-based genotyping can be powerful for genome-wide association studies; for example two Mendelian traits were mapped in canines to regions < 1 Mb using a genotyping array and only twenty individuals [7] , and a Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium human study identified disease susceptibility factors using a 500k SNP typing array [8] .",

The nearly 100 var gene family members are distributed across the 14 chromosomes in both subtelomeric clusters and internal clusters [15] [16] [17] where their highly polymorphic nature make accurate SNP detection through hybridization especially challenging. Furthermore, individual parasite clones have unique var gene repertoires with minimal overlap limited to just several family members [18, 19] , meaning that probes designed from a reference genome will not be able to effectively interrogate the majority of var genes in other parasite genomes. Similarly, there is limited utility to hybridization-based SNP detection in the subtelomeric rif and stevor multi-gene families which also encode highly polymorphic proteins that are exported to the host cell surface [20, 21] .",

Population genomic studies will require optimal identification of CNPs that could be important determinants of emerging drug resistances; however a powerful corollary to this approach will be to encode a set of high-resolution SNP markers that can be genotyped on the same chip. We observed that some known SNPs sufficiently influenced hybridization to be detected. Here, we assess the overall capabilities of a first generation P. falciparum probe set designed for the NimbleGen microarray platform to correctly identify SNPs genome-wide. A comprehensive set of sequence polymorphisms between 3D7, HB3, and Dd2 was compiled using available sequence data [3] , and was compared to CGH data from 3D7-HB3, 3D7-Dd2, HB3-Dd2 hybridizations. We determined SNP sensitivity and SNP specificity in a completely unbiased, whole-genome method. Sensitivity with respect to probe length, melting temperature, GC content, SNP location, and base mutation revealed how these parameters affect SNP detection, and will facilitate the production of an openly available platform designed for unbiased, genome-wide surveys of polymorphisms optimized for SNP detection. The custom design capabilities of this high-resolution microarray platform can be cost-effectively optimized for individual experiments and will facilitate community access to a powerful genomics tool.",

The probe set consisted of variable length probes ranging from 45 to 83-mers designed to all regions of the genome, including genes and intergenic regions. This probe size range is optimal for detection of CNPs but is considerably longer than has been described for SFP genotyping. Each probe corresponded to a unique sequence that occurred only once in the entire reference genome with a 48 bp median probe spacing and an 8 bp median probe overlap. Probe coverage on this array represented 69.4% of the nucleotides in the complete reference genome and 77.7% of nucleotides in genes. Coding regions are well-represented in the probe set by virtue of their sequence characteristics, not because they were targeted by this design as has been the case for other expression-focused chips. Regions of the telomeres and subtelomeres, as well as other highly repetitive regions, were covered less densely, including some large gaps that will be inaccessible to microarray-based approaches because sufficiently unique probes cannot be designed. Regardless, our design procedure provides an unbiased assessment of the uniqueness of genome regions that will be most amenable to chip-based genotyping as well as other shotgun and `next-gen' technologies. Genome wide probe distribution ( Fig. 1) illustrates the wider probe spacing in the subtelomeric regions and in areas of polymorphic multigene families. Unique probes were found in these regions but at reduced density. In intergenic regions, there was no median probe overlap, but in genes -excluding var/rif/ stevor genes -there was a 17 bp median probe overlap. On average, genes had probes with 16 nt overlap, intergenic regions had no probe overlap, and genome-wide -including all repetitive regions -probes had an 8 nt overlap.",

The majority of these probes were in highly polymorphic, multigene family members (var/rif/stevor genes); because individual parasite genomes have unique complements of these multigene families, signal bias often is due to factors other than point mutations so we have also defined our optimizing parameters by excluding the multigene families. The total number of SFPs detected was 3235 when polymorphic multigene families were excluded (Supplemental Table S1 ). As a first unbiased pass with no attempt to specifically target SNPs and using longer oligonucleotide probes, this number of SFPs suggests a strong potential for tiled CGH chips to include dense SNP marker coverage.

Sensitivity is the portion of gold probes that exceeded the signal ratio cutoff in Fig. 3 ; i.e. the proportion of polymorphisms correctly recognized as SFPs. Specificity is the portion of blue colored probes that did not exceed the signal ratio cutoff in Fig. 3 . Sensitivity and specificity analyses across the range of signal ratios characterized the relationship between false positives and false negatives. This identifies the point at which we achieve high specificity (i.e. few false positives were observed) while maximizing sensitivity (Fig. 4 ) leading us to chose the 0.8 signal ratio cutoff. Sensitivity was low in this dataset and a subtle but noticeable difference in sensitivity was observed between genes and intergenic regions. Specificity did not vary between genes and intergenic regions and was very high overall. At a 0.8 cutoff, specificity surpassed 99.9%. A key observation here is that false positives were extraordinarily rare in this dataset. Given the large number of true negatives (probes that did not span a polymorphism), a 0.8 cutoff yielding 99.94% specificity and 6.9% sensitivity in genes was used for all analyses. Significantly, our data indicate that cost-effective, single replication hybridization genotyping does not risk false positives, however it is certain that probe optimization for parameters affecting SNP detection and/or replication will provide increased sensitivity.",

Fig. 5 illustrates the variable sensitivity to SNPs in genes according to probe length, melting temperature, GC content, SNP location in the probe, and point mutation type. Probe length analysis determined that shorter probes were more sensitive to SNPs (Fig. 5A) . A 47 nt probe length had the greatest sensitivity at 22.2%. Probe lengths ranged from 45 -83mers however none of the 45-mers encompassed SNPs while there were 141 probes longer than 71 nt that encompassed SNPs, but none of these detected polymorphisms. Notably, probe length is a key distinguishing feature of platforms dedicated to CNP vs. SNP detection. Probe melting temperatures ranged from 60 -80\u00b0C and analysis showed that probes with lower melting temperatures were more sensitive (Fig. 5B) . The lowest melting temperature group had the greatest sensitivity at 9.5% while the highest melting temperature group had 2.6% sensitivity. Probe GC content ranged from 4 -52% and intermediate GC content showed the highest sensitivity at 7.4%. Probes with the most extreme GC content had the worst sensitivity; no probes with GC content greater than 45% detected SNPs (Fig. 5C) . A SNP region analysis examining the effect of SNP location divided the probe into five equal regions: region I was the 5' section, region V was the 3' section, and region III occupied the center of the probe. Region I had the highest SNP sensitivity (12.0%), and this degraded when the SNP was closer to the 3' end reaching as low as 1.2% sensitivity in region V (Fig. 5D ). Finer scale analysis demonstrated that there was degraded sensitivity at the extreme 5' end and that maximum sensitivity was near the junction of regions I and II (Supplemental Fig. S3 ). Mutation type analysis grouped SNPs by original base (in the 3D7 reference genome) synthesized into the microarray probe. As shown in Fig. 5E , SNP sensitivity was drastically worse for mutations that diverged from A's and T's (2.9% and 2.2% respectively) compared with detecting mutations that diverged from C's and G's (14.0% and 8.6% respectively).

Probe hairpin analysis relied on UNAFold [25] for secondary structure and change in free energy (dG) predictions where dG was used as a measure of hairpin stability; structures with a lower dG were more stable. It was possible for a sequence to have multiple folds and the analysis took all predicted structures into account.

Each of the resequenced loci had polymorphisms from one of two classes: 1) SNP adjacent to the probe target site; 2) variable number tandem repeat polymorphisms (Fig. 7) . In cases where a SNP was found adjacent to the probe target site, secondary structure predictions revealed that the SNP gave rise to new hairpin folds. These structures were predicted to be more stable and form in regions of the gDNA targeted by the probes. In the second polymorphism class, tandem repeat units ranged in size from 3 -54 bp. At each of these loci, 3D7 and HB3 differed in the number of times the sequence was repeated, but both strains carried the repeat. This repeat copy polymorphism ranged from a difference of 1 to 5 units. The repeats partially overlapped parts of the nucleotide sequence represented in the probes, however, the differing number of repeats caused no sequence polymorphism at the probe target sequence.",

            "text": "It is possible to detect SNPs with high specificity in the P. falciparum genome using a CGH design optimized for copy number variation. Previous investigations of probe design relied on limited sets of probes to examine individual parameters and often hybridize artificial samples such as PCR products [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . The results from the current study were derived from more then 300,000 probes using complex biological samples and a global SNP set for HB3/Dd2/3D7 derived from their genome sequences. We observe very high specificity, however our chip optimized for CNP was not sensitive for whole-genome level SNP detection. Because our study comprehensively evaluated SNPs, without pre-selecting for favorable characteristics, it was possible to assess the probe features that dictate sensitivity and specificity. We define the probe parameters that define the degree to which point mutations can be assayed reliably. Our analysis differs from, but compliments the recent study by Jiang et al. which used the Affymetrix PFSANGER microarray with over 2.2 million P. falciparum probes to focus on SNP detection in a set of 2651 SNPs reporting 81% sensitivity [11] . Together, these studies demonstrate that gene chips can carefully target \"high quality SNPs\" to provide very high sensitivity and specificity that will be necessary for high-resolution genome-wide association studies. Sensitivity for SNP genotyping by hybridization is compounded by the high AT content of the P. falciparum genome. For example, sensitivity was better in coding regions, reflecting the relatively low sequence complexity and repetitive stretches in intergenic regions. Decreased probe density in subtelomeric regions and polymorphic multigenic families illustrate the challenge of assaying these regions using tiling and resequencing arrays, just as they are not amenable to PCR applications or assembly following shotgun sequencing. Probe performance parameters have been evaluated for gene expression applications [26] , however in gene expression studies, sensitivity refers to the ability to detect the relative abundance of transcripts to minimize the impact of sequence polymorphisms on hybridization signals. Conversely in CGH applications used to identify SFPs, sensitivity refers to the ability to detect small polymorphisms through their impact on hybridization signal. This distinction is important because relatively long probes increase transcript detection sensitivity in gene expression arrays, and also CNP detection in gDNA, but decrease polymorphism detection sensitivity in CGH arrays.",

Other studies have reported that longer probes are prone to cross-hybridization or hybridizing to targets with one or more polymorphisms [26, 30] . For P. falciparum SNP detection, the optimal probe length or melting temperature has not been defined. Our data indicate a steady improvement in performance with shorter probe lengths down to 45 nt. However, at some point shorter probes should become detrimental to SNP detection and it is not established that commonly used 25-mers are the optimal length, especially in the AT rich P. falciparum genome. A study of probe length effect on mismatch discrimination provides some insight into this issue [30] . Perfect match (PM): mismatch (MM) signal ratio comparison for 25, 30, and 35-mers finds that 30-mers have a greater ability to distinguish PM/MM probes with a signal ratio > 2. Although 25-mers have a greater average PM:MM ratio, 30-mers were able to distinguish a greater percentage of PM/MM pairs with a 2-fold signal difference. Another study estimates that 50-mers are less prone to cross-hybridization than 25-mers [26] . For SNP calling, probes longer than 25-mers may be able to correctly type more loci and probes designed at variable lengths for each individual target may provide even greater discrimination. Probes longer than uniform 25-mers employed by Affymetrix, likely will give greater specificity in an AT rich genome while enhancing CNP analysis. Studies comparing variable probe length performance to fixed length performance will be helpful in optimizing probe design.",

The underlying assumption is that a central mismatch is most disruptive to hybridization so the MM signal is a measure of non-specific hybridization [32] . Future designs can account for this by including probes which are 5' anchored or by using spacer molecules to distance the oligonucleotides from the solid support [33] .

When analyzing a region of relatively high probe density there was greater SNP sensitivity: 6.9% genome-wide compared to 12.8% in the high probe density region (Table 1) . Furthermore, and not surprisingly, multi-probe coverage of a SNP was associated with increased sensitivity (21.6%). This performance difference reflected SNP location in the probe and illustrates the improvement of a new design that incorporates this feature to target SNPs. For a SNP, an ideal probe can be designed to optimally target that SNP, however, in the case of SNPs with multi-probe coverage, it was not expected that all SNPs were interrogated by the ideal probe, so allele-specific probes designed to optimally target individual SNPs would be expected to give performance surpassing 21.6% SNP sensitivity.

Sensitivity will improve with the use of allele specific probes where we estimate a genome-wide SNP sensitivity rate that exceeds 22%. Significantly, we show that single replicate hybridization allows genotyping without risking false positives. As chips advance to greater probe densities, increased probe numbers will allow increased resolution and redundant coverage for more accurate and precise mapping of polymorphisms. It is apparent from human studies that genome structural variation may be an important contributor to polymorphism that must be interrogated in addition to SNPs [39] . The information from this study will lead to an openly available, refined probe set that measures genome structural variations and has been optimized for SNP detection in P. falciparum. These technologies will ultimately allow quicker and more cost effective identification of all polymorphisms present in a sample which can be linked to phenotypes or used in evolutionary studies.",

Briefly, probes were tiled through the genome at a 4 bp interval spacing using filtering criteria of T m 60-80\u00b0C and length 45-85 bp. The resulting probes were clustered with nearest neighbors and sorted to remove probes with extensive sequence identity to any other probe. Regardless of length, any probe with more than one 45-mer exact match in the genome was discarded. The most unique 385,585 probes, based on average 15-mer frequency and base pair composition score, were synthesized on the chip using maskless photolithography [22, 23] . The current CGH design, \"080222_Plasmodium_3D7_WG_CGH\" can be ordered from NimbleGen.
