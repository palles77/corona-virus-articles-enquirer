Also, the protease Factor Xa, a target of Ben-HCl abundantly expressed in infected cells, was able to cleave the recombinant and pseudoviral S protein into S1 and S2 subunits, and the cleavage was inhibited by Ben-HCl. Furthermore, this cleavage correlated with the infectivity of the pseudovirus. Taken together, our study suggests a plausible mechanism by which SARS-CoV cleaves its S protein to facilitate viral infection.",

The N-terminal region of the S protein has been demonstrated to mediate viral infection, by binding through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) to a cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [2] , and subsequently inducing virus-cell membrane fusion, which involves two domains in the C-terminal region of the S protein named heptad repeat (HR) 1 and 2 [3] .

Studies on other coronaviruses have further elucidated that conformational changes of the S protein can be induced at 37\u00b0C and pH 8.0, accompanied by the cleavage of S1 and S2, which triggers virus-cell membrane fusion [6, 7] . As a new member of the coronavirus family, SARS-CoV shares with other coronaviruses some similarity and common features in the amino acid sequences of the S protein [8] . It has been found that the S protein of SARS-CoV is post-translationally cleaved into S1 and S2 functional domains in the process of viral infection [9] . However, the impact of this cleavage on viral infectivity remains unclear [10] . Our previous study has shown that SARS-CoV infectivity was inhibited over 99.99% in cell cultures by pre-incubation with two peptides, which correspond to the sequences (amino acid residues 598-617 and 737-756) proximal to the potential S1 and S2 cleavage site, suggesting that these critical sites or regions might be influential in viral infection [11] . In this study, we aimed to further investigate which proteases may be important in the cleavage of the S protein and whether the cleavage of SARS-CoV S protein has an impact on viral infectivity.",

As a whole, our study suggests a plausible mechanism by which SARS-CoV cleaves the S protein through the protease Factor Xa of infected cells to facilitate viral infection. Thus, the infection of SARS-CoV not only involves the binding of RBD with its receptor ACE2 and the fusion between viral envelope and host cell membrane, but also is associated with the cleavage of the S protein by proteases on the cell membrane, such as Factor Xa. It has been reported that the S protein of SARS-CoV forms trimeric peplomer on the surface of the virion [11] . The cleavage of the S protein may trigger virus-cell fusion subsequent to the binding with ACE2 receptor and the dissociation of trimeric S protein to monomers.",
