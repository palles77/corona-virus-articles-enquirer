In the search for alternatives to \u03b2-lactams, we have investigated a series of compounds designed to generate transition state analogue structures on reaction with DD-peptidases. The compounds contain a combination of a peptidoglycan-mimetic specificity handle and a warhead capable of delivering a tetrahedral anion to the enzyme active site. The latter include a boronic acid, two alcohols, an aldehyde and a trifluoroketone. The compounds were tested against two low molecular mass class C DDpeptidases. As expected from previous observations, the boronic acid was a potent inhibitor, but, rather unexpectedly from precedent, the trifluoroketone [D-\u03b1-aminopimelyl-(1,1,1-trifluoro-3amino)butan-2-one] was also very effective. Taking into account competing hydration, the trifluoroketone was the strongest inhibitor of the Actinomadura R39 DD-peptidase, with a subnanomolar (free ketone) inhibition constant. A crystal structure of the complex between the trifluoroketone and the R39 enzyme showed that a tetrahedral adduct had indeed formed with the active site serine nucleophile. The trifluoroketone moiety, therefore, should be considered along with boronic acids and phosphonates, as a warhead that can be incorporated into new and effective DD-peptidase inhibitors and therefore, perhaps, antibiotics.",

(1) These enzymes catalyze the final transpeptidation reaction in the biosynthesis of bacterial cell walls and are essential to bacterial survival. The \u03b2-lactams, acting as mechanism-based/transition state analogue inhibitors (2-4), are precisely structured to inactivate DD-peptidases in a manner that these enzymes have been unable to escape through evolution of a hydrolytic pathway. Bacteria have, however, been able to achieve resistance to \u03b2-lactams in a number of ways unrelated to DD-peptidase active site structure, and, in particular through evolution of \u03b2-lactamases from DD-peptidases (2,4). The \u03b2-lactamases, unlike DD-peptidases, are able to catalyze rapid \u03b2-lactam hydrolysis and thus destruction of their antibiotic activity (5).",

One obvious approach is through transition-state analogues, since such molecules should, in principle, inhibit any enzyme (16) (17) (18) . Since the reactions catalyzed by DD-peptidases in vivo are acyl-transfer reactions with a covalent acyl(serine)-enzyme intermediate (Scheme 1), substrate-based tetrahedral anions, covalently bound to the active site serine should be good analogues of the transition states of both acylation and deacylation steps. In principle, therefore the molecule 1, where \"peptidoglycan\" is a specific peptidoglycan, or peptidoglycan-mimetic fragment and X is a reactive moiety that generates a tetrahedral anion on reaction with the active site serine, would be the inhibitor of choice.",

One might expect that the former goal would be informed by studies of the substrate specificity of these enzymes, where a minimal, consensual, and thus broad spectrum peptidoglycan fragment would emerge. This goal has, however, not yet been achieved. It is true, of course, that peptidoglycan structure varies in detail between bacterial species, but even given this point, no consensual structure/class of privileged structures has emerged from consideration of DD-peptidase substrate specificity (19, 20) . DD-Peptidases have been classified structurally into two groups, the low molecular mass (LMM) 1 and high molecular mass (HMM) enzymes (21) . The latter group is essential for bacterial growth and contains the killing targets of \u03b2-lactams. The former group are also inhibited by \u03b2-lactams but are not essential for bacterial survival, in the short term at least. Both groups of enzymes are believed to catalyze acyl-transfer reactions of peptidoglycan, viz. transpeptidase (HMM), carboxypeptidase and endopeptidase (LMM) reactions. Certain members of the LMM group, subclasses B and C, have been shown to have strong specificity for a free amine N-terminus in peptidoglycan substrates (19, (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) , but no strong specificity for any particular element of peptidoglycan has been demonstrated for the HMM enzymes (13, 19, 24, 28, 29) . Design of transition state analogue inhibitors for the latter enzymes is thus difficult.",

To date, the combination of the motifs 3-6, with a specific peptidoglycan fragment (as in 1) has not been investigated.

The configuration 3 of alcohols at the active site is therefore unfavorable. It should be noted in passing that the alcohol 8 was obtained as a mixture of four diastereoisomers in roughly equal amounts (see 19 F NMR data in Supporting Information), only one of which would be expected to be an inhibitor (2R3S). Serine hydrolases, in general, are not efficiently inhibited by alcohols, even when specific (e.g. 43,44). The phosphonates 9 and 10 were also ineffective against the DD-peptidases. Presumably, the configuration 28 is not favorable either. A series of arylamidophosphonic acids was also found to lack significant inhibitory activity against the R39 DD-peptidase (12) .

It is likely (also see below) that these carbonyl compounds form the tetrahedral adducts, 4 and 5, respectively, at the active site. The greater effectiveness of the trifluoroketone is likely to be due in part to the higher alcohol acidity of the adduct (47), allowing thermodynamically more favorable formation of 6 than 5 at pH 7.5 [pK a values of trifluoroethanol and ethanol are 12.4 and 16 (48) , respectively, favoring anion formation by the former by a factor of 10 3.6 ].

From 1 H NMR spectra (not shown), K H for 11 is 30 and, therefore, from eq 2, the \"real\" K i values for the carbonyl form of 11 are 2.5 \u03bcM and 16.1 \u03bcM, respectively, for the R39 DD-peptidase and PBP4a. The effect of hydration is even more dramatic with 12. Although estimates of K H for trifluoroacetone in the literature are curiously wide-ranging (47, 49, 50) , the lower limit estimate is 35 (49) . If the additional effect of the amido substituent is included as a factor of 30 [estimated from the K H values of acetaldehyde (49) and 11], then a lower limit estimate of K H for 12 would be 1000. Certainly, we are unaware of any report in the literature of NMR observation of the carbonyl form of a \u03b1-trifluoro-\u03b1\u2032-amidoketone in aqueous solution (e.g. 51,52). Thus K i values for 12, corrected for hydration, can be estimated as 0.37 nM and 13.5 nM for the R39 DD-peptidase and PBP4a, respectively. These estimates represent upper limits and may be an order of magnitude larger than the real values. These carbonyl compounds are certainly powerful inhibitors of the LMMC DD-peptidases and, on reaction with the enzymes, may well generate structures resembling tetrahedral high-energy intermediates/transition states (see below). (2) The lack of specificity of the trifluoromethyl moiety itself and the importance of the specific N-terminus is confirmed by the data of Table 2 where the effectiveness of the generic inhibitors 24 25, 26 and 27, bearing the \"warheads\" of 2, 7, 11, and 12, respectively, is displayed.

The product of reaction of 12 with the substrate 14, Q, which presumably is 30, must be a weak inhibitor of the R39 enzyme.

This may relate to the same order of reactivity of specific substrates with these enzymes (20) . On the other hand, the analogous boronate 2 is a stronger inhibitor of PBP4a than of the R39 enzyme. The latter difference, however, may relate to the interesting observation that the binding of 2 to PBP4a is a slow (minutes; two step?) process (20) , whereas its binding to the R39 enzyme is fast (with respect to manual mixing times). No time dependence in the inhibition of either of these enzymes by 11 and 12 was observed.",

Initial electron density maps resulting from the molecular replacement were excellent for the four protein monomers present in the asymmetric unit, allowing a precise localization of 12 in the active site of each monomer (Figure 3 ). The inhibitor 12 is covalently bonded to the active serine Ser49, the carbonyl carbon is now tetrahedral, and the ketone oxygen occupies the oxyanion hole, defined by the backbone NH groups of Ser49 and Thr413. The D-methyl group is directed into a hydrophobic pocket comprised residues Gly148, Leu 349 and Met414. As previously observed in the structures of the R39 enzyme with the boronic acid 2 (30), a cephalosporin or a peptide (26) , each bearing an aminopimelic side chain, the aminopimelyl side chain runs along a hydrophobic groove and is fixed by a series of hydrogen bonds between the amido group and Asn300N\u03b42 and Thr413O atoms, and between the terminal D-\u03b1-amino acid moiety and the Arg351 guanidinium, the Asp142 carboxylate and the Ser415 hydroxyl.",

            "text": "The most novel element of the structure is the position of the trifluoromethyl group and its interaction with the enzyme active site. Branching from the tetrahedral carbon bonded to Ser49O\u03b3, the CF 3 group occupies the likely position of a leaving group in the tetrahedral intermediate of a peptidase substrate [and thus of one of the boronate hydroxyl groups in the analogous complex with 2 (30) ]. An overlap of the active site elements of the boronate 2 complex and that of the trifluoroketone 12, both bearing a free D-\u03b1-aminopimelyl Nterminus, for which this enzyme is specific (20, 24) , is shown in Figure 4 . The inhibitors are essentially identically placed in the active site, as would be expected of transition state analogs with such similar structure, with the CF 3 group of 12 overlapping directly with the \"leaving group\" boronate hydroxyl. With respect to the position of the CF 3 group, one O-C-C-F dihedral angle is 57\u00b0, indicating an essentially precise staggering of the fluorine atoms with respect to the oxyanion O \u2212 . This conformation would be expected, of course, on steric and electrostatic grounds and has been observed in serine protease/trifluoroketone complexes (for example, in reference 55). One fluorine atom is directed out of the active site into solvent where it might well interact with water molecules in the manner observed in a variety of crystal structures (55) (56) (57) (58) . Such interactions are probably more dipolar in nature than involving classical hydrogen bonding and are probably of ca 1 kcal/mol strength (59, 60) . The other two fluorine atoms appear to interact in a bifurcated fashion at a distance of 3.0 \u00c5 each with the hydroxyl of Ser298. This kind of arrangement has been previously observed, for example in a trifluoroketone adduct with chymotrypsin (55), where two fluorines interact with a water molecule, and in a thrombin complex where a similar interaction with a water molecule has been observed (57) . It is interesting that the Lys52 terminal nitrogen has not moved closer than 4.0 \u00c5 distance to a fluorine atom. There are many examples of close NH---F interactions of < 3.0 \u00c5 in complexes of enzymes with fluorinated inhibitors (55) (56) (57) (58) 61) . In the present case, the Lys52 amine would certainly be protonated, in a negatively charged transition state analog structure as it is and where it is strongly interacting with Ser49O\u03b3 (2.9 \u00c5) and Asn300O \u03b4 (2.8 \u00c5).",

It owes its potency to the trifluoroketone moiety, elevating it over the less electrophilic aldehyde 11 and other tetrahedral species derived from 7-10, which occupy the active site less favorably. As shown by the very limited effectiveness of the generic analogues 24-27, it is clear that 12 is able to achieve its effectiveness only in combination with the strong specificity produced by the D-\u03b1-aminopimelyl terminus, whose affinity for certain LMMC DD-peptidases has been established. This combination of the trifluoroketone, which forms a tetrahedral adduct with the active site serine, and the D-\u03b1-aminopimelyl terminus into a complete inhibitor of the R39 DD-peptidase is seen very clearly in the crystal structure of the complex between the enzyme and 12. The trifluoroketone moiety and other activated carbonyls, therefore, should be considered along with boronic acids and phosphonates, as warheads that can be incorporated into new and effective DD-peptidase inhibitors and therefore, perhaps, antibiotics.

Enzyme kinetics studies Inhibition of the Actinomadura R39 DD-peptidase by compounds 7-12-In view of the nature of the inhibitors and all precedent (20,24-26), the inhibition was interpreted in all cases as purely competitive. Equilibrium constants for inhibition of the R39 DD-peptidase by the compounds 7 (0 -3.0 mM), 10 (0 -2.0 mM) and 11 (0 -1.0 mM), 8 (0 -400 \u03bcM), 9 (0 -2.0 mM) and 12 (0 -40 \u03bcM) were obtained from steady-state competition experiments where 14 was employed as a chromogenic (245 nm, \u0394\u03b5 = 2500 cm \u22121 M \u22121 ) substrate (0.5 mM). The reaction conditions were 20 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.50, 25 \u00b0C, and an enzyme concentration of 210 nM. Under these conditions, the K m value of the substrate was 38.4 \u03bcM",

The initial rates of reaction of 14, catalyzed by this enzyme, as a function of concentrations of 7-10 were fitted to Scheme 6 by the Dynafit program (39).
