With an estimated population of 7100 adult and adolescent cheetahs in their natural habitat (Durant et al., 2017) , long-term conservation research programs are collectively working on strategies to ensure their survival. Over the past 4 decades, a small but prolific group of international researchers and conservation biologists has emerged, all dedicated to solving the problems that threaten cheetah survival. Their collective research is presented in the chapters of this book and brings together what we currently know about the cheetah, the challenges it is facing, and the solutions that have been developed. Many of the cheetah conservation strategies that currently are being undertaken have a unique and interesting history of how they began. Here we endeavor to offer a historical overview and timeline that ties together the information presented in the chapters of this book.",

As a consequence, game dealers showed farmers how to catch cheetahs with cage traps. From the late 1960s through the 1970s several thousand cheetahs were caught for the world's zoos . Cage traps typically were set at cheetah marking trees, visited primarily by males; but zoos preferred females. For every female cheetah caught, up to 20 males were captured, many of which were killed by the farmers .",

They recorded hunting methods, social interactions, maternal behavior, family structure, mother-cub interactions, coexistence with other predators, and developed a methodology for identifying cheetahs by spot patterns on the face (Chapter 32). Their method of weighing carcasses after meals and noting the portion consumed became the norm for many cheetah feeding ecology studies (Frame and Frame, 1981) .",

While there were perhaps 40,000 wild cheetahs in 1960, there were reportedly fewer than 20,000 by 1975, and of those, fewer than 3,000 in Africa's protected areas (Myers, 1975; Chapter 19) . The reduced numbers were attributed to conflict with larger predators inside protected areas and conflict with the growing human populations outside protected areas (Myers, 1975) . It was recognized that the mere existence of protected areas was insufficient to guarantee the long-term survival of this wide-ranging carnivore. Myers reported that cheetahs occurred at low densities with a limited distribution in only a small portion of sub-Saharan Africa and was the first to call for action \"in the near future to reverse this decline.\" Myers voiced his concerns over a growing African human population and the human disturbances impacting Africa's wildlife. In particular, carnivores like the cheetah were under pressure due to the potential threat they posed to livestock. In 1975, Africa's population was 450 million people and growing by 3.5%-4.5% per year, exerting unsustainable pressures on wild lands and wildlife. He reported that livestock farmers in Kenya, Namibia, and Zimbabwe were motivated to engage in cheetah persecution as they were receiving \"compensation revenue\" through the sales of skins (Myers, 1975) . The countries Myers considered having the greatest potential for cheetah conservation initiatives were Botswana, Kenya, Namibia, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe, and sustainable land management was encouraged to balance the needs of wildlife, people, livestock, and the land (Myers, 1975) .",

Launched as an educational cheetah encounter facility, its focus is conserving South Africa's wild cheetahs. Adapting CCF's educational outreach programs, Cheetah Outreach began to educate school children and the public and developed a cheetah ambassador program (Chapter 28) working closely to develop nutritional guidelines for captive cheetahs (Chapter 26). In addition, they developed a livestock guarding-dog program and work closely with livestock farmers to help reduce conflict.",
