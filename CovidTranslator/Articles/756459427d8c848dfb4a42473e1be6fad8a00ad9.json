Within three years, it developed from a consortium of nine European laboratories to encompass associated partners in Africa, Russia, China, Turkey, Germany and Italy. Following the H2020, 2014 call for Research and Innovation Framework Programme (INFRAS projects) the concept of developing the EVA into a global organization was a natural progression and the project was funded for a four-year period. In April 2015, the EVAg started to operate as a non-profit consortium including 26 partners and 20 associated partners from 21 EU and non-EU countries. Based on excellent progress during the first two operational years, we have every reason to believe that the consortium will continue to expand and will ultimately constitute the world's largest virus collection. In this paper, we outline the structure, management and goals of the EVAg, to bring to the attention of researchers the wealth of products it can provide and to illustrate how end-users can gain access to these resources.",

Many of the known viruses are in collections that may be lost or discarded when the virologist in charge retires or when a laboratory closes or is reorganized. Other collections may not be available to the wider virology community, because scientists are not always willing or in a position to share their viral isolates. They may lack the infrastructure, time (manpower), facilities and experience to characterize and present their collection in an accessible catalogue and further be able to ship their collected strains to foreign countries due to the restraints imposed by increasingly complex transportation regulations. Furthermore, many governments have introduced additional security measures that specifically regulate the transfer and/or exchange, between countries, of high-risk-group pathogens that may attract the interest of terrorist organisations. Additionally, laboratories in Russia, China, India, Southeast Asia and South America hold their own virus collections, many of which, to date, have been relatively inaccessible to European laboratories. Viruses from many taxonomic families have also been identified on the African continent and some well-developed laboratories in Africa have made their collections readily accessible to researchers in Europe and the Americas. Currently, however, except for a few countries, including Senegal, South Africa and Kenya, authenticated virus collections from other regions of Africa are virtually nonexistent.",

The current project aims at the development of virus collections in low-income countries where, in some cases, there has been an understandable reluctance to exchange viruses for fear of losing their resource to institutes from more highly developed countries. The EVAg infrastructure provides assured access to modern capacities, thereby assisting these institutes to train their staff in developing their own resources and expanding and maintaining these capacities locally. End-user requests for viruses and reagents from these developing laboratories will be entirely managed from within, but supported by the quality management and distribution systems of the consortium.

European collections of specified animal pathogens, particularly lyssaviruses, pestiviruses, arboviruses and influenza viruses are maintained at the Animal and Plant Health Agency and at The Pirbright Institute in the United Kingdom; in Italy at the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVe) hosting the World Organization for Animal Health/Food and Agriculture Organization (OIE/FAO) and EU reference laboratory for avian influenza; and in France at the Institut Pasteur. RG4 viruses such as Ebola and Nipah are maintained in specialised facilities in France, Germany Russia, the USA, China, South Africa and the UK.

It would be virtually impossible to establish a single laboratory to maintain supplies of all recognised pathogenic mammalian viruses. Based on the knowledge and experience gained from the former EVA project, we have addressed these problems by using web-based tools to centralise access to quality-controlled, standardised preparations of viruses held in laboratories worldwide. The underlying concept is simple, but because virologists are naturally protective of their collections, its success has required a paradigm shift in the mind-set of the partners or associated partners in the individual laboratories.",

In preparing the proposal, it was emphasised that it would be virtually impossible to generate a wide-ranging virus archive in a single laboratory complex. Thus, although many high-calibre virology laboratories operate in Europe, it was decided to retain the \"virology club tradition\" by developing the principle of an integrated international infrastructure via consortia, operating through validated networks.

This was possible because the rule of reciprocal benefit was agreed: the non-EU partner provision activity of material to an EU entity (research institute, health organization, animal health-care structure, etc.) was eligible for financial compensation from the consortium EU budget. Consequently, 26 highcalibre European and non-European partner laboratories agreed to become the primary members of the EVAg consortium. These are listed in Table 1 Partner laboratories that form the core of the EVAg, listed in chronological order of their integration into the project. Both medical and veterinarian institutes are included to cover viral zoonotic diseases. It also illustrates the wide geographic coverage already attained and demonstrates that BSL4 laboratories are major contributors to this consortium. The choice of institutes also reflects the specific available skills and know-how of scientists in institutes closely associated with the most well-known contemporary emerging viruses. We have also begun to integrate network organisations such as the Global Approach to Biological Research, Infectious diseases and Epidemics in Low-income countries (GABRIEL) Network, of the Fondation Merieux and the International Pasteur Institutes. Future plans include expansion of partnerships to countries not currently represented, such as Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, South America, and additional African countries. In addition, 16 associate partners who share the same interest in the dissemination of viruses and reagents, but are not beneficiaries of the EU grant, have now been included (see Table 2 ). This association was formalized by the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding. The archive is founded on the principle that members and associate members of the consortium retain ownership of the viruses that they disseminate via the centralised distribution centre. The virologist or institution that supplies the viruses to the customer retains the ownership and enters into agreements with the customer via material transfer agreements (MTAs). All orders for viruses and associated reagents (cell cultures, recombinant proteins, RNA, DNA, recombinant viruses, plasmids, monoclonal antibodies), are placed via the website https://www. european-virus-archive.com/which is managed centrally in Marseille by the Management team (partner#1, Aix-Marseille University).",

The objective was to evaluate the feasibility of this approach concerning both the collaborative exchanges related to development of a common infrastructure and the operational effectiveness of resource distribution. From the point of view of scientific collaboration, the process was established rapidly and functioned efficiently. However, standardisation of the procedure for the distribution of materials to end-users proved to be challenging, and it is still being developed and improved within the current consortium. The reason for this slow progress is almost entirely due to the complexity of national regulations. Whilst the European Regulations retain the principle of being national and are enforced primarily to control the circulation of pathogens, they have been developed to maintain uniformity throughout the EU countries. Thus, the administrative pathway to obtaining authorisation for an exchange of resources between, for example, France and Germany or the Netherlands and Italy are very similar and are principally based on agreements provided by the National Biosafety Agencies. In contrast, the process of exchanging resources between the EU and Russia or between the EU and the USA involves many more constraints: the intervention of different administrations in processing authorisation for delivery of hazardous goods including, biosafety agencies, customs administration, commerce and trade administration, ministry of health, etc. (Also, the law in Russia does not permit the import or export of pathogens.) Nevertheless, our expertise in overcoming these hurdles is exemplified by the report of studies on the RG4 virus Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus in which the virus was supplied by a European partner to an end-user in the USA (Haddock et al., 2018) . Not surprisingly, when Zika virus emerged in South America and was found to be responsible for microcephaly, we received numerous requests for Zika virus, and many papers have been published with recognition of the EVAg as the source of virus. Five examples encompassing, i) simultaneous transmission with chikungunya virus, ii) diagnosis, iii) signal processing pathways, iv) pathogenesis in relation to foetal infections and v) virus structure, are cited here (Goertz et al., 2017; Chan et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2016; Miner et al., 2016; Sirohi et al., 2016) .",

They all gained important experience in the management of such health crises, collecting field samples and isolated relevant virus strains many of which are now characterised and stored in the facilities of the EVAg BSL-4 partner at the Bernard Nocht Institute in Hamburg, Germany. In addition, they addressed specific issues involving management of the exchange of high risk pathogens and activation of platforms dedicated to offering services to appropriate endusers.",

Its ultimate objective is to become a permanent archive that provides access to a very wide range of viruses and reagents globally. This will be achieved firstly, through extension of the funding arrangements, secondly through further increasing the range of contributors to the collection, and thirdly by bridging large European or international infrastructures having activities related to those of EVAg, including: It would be naive to suggest that the long-term survival of the consortium will be straightforward. For example, its perpetuation will require a continuous and increasingly large funding stream to meet the almost restrictive costs of research, laboratory development and upkeep in the face of newly emerging highly pathogenic viruses. Sustainability is a key issue for such an infrastructure and the consortium plan will be to remain a non-profit organization.",

The financial support for all the actions involved in preparedness for emerging viral diseases e.g., distribution of bio-resources to supply reagents to detect infected patients at local level will have to come from government health departments but at the international level, from the European Commission, charitable international health funding agencies such as the Wellcome Trust Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the WHO, the OIE. Future financial planning also includes the creation of a specific interface between the industrial sector and the consortium. In the first instance, this interface will explore bi-directional opportunities to organize scientific exchanges, priority access to bio-resources including reference material development of diagnostic services, validation of diagnostic assays and commercialization by industrial partners to the benefit of both parties. Signed contracts of collaboration will be facilitated, and procedures harmonized.",

As far as we are aware, there is no equivalent viral archive, nor does any other collection provide the accessibility, reagent backup, sequence data, provenance, quality control, and capacity to advertise, inform, negotiate and conduct the entire transaction to the end-user via the web and internationally registered secure transportation companies The reputations, high quality, experience and knowledge of the consortium partners, combined with the integration of the European Commission infrastructure, will provide endusers with opportunities to approach new fields of research in structural viral genomics, evolutionary biology, control of infectious diseases, antiviral drug design, fundamental research, public and environmental health, pathogenesis, immunology and a wide variety of associated disciplines. Subsequently, subject to continuation of funding and the appropriate justification, the EVAg aims to extend the diversity of its disciplines to encompass fish, plant, bacterial, fungal, protist and other currently unrecognised viruses. This will be achieved first through expansion within the European Community, followed by integration of specialist laboratories in the Americas, Russia, Asia, Southeast Asia, Australia and Africa. The recently created African CDC will provide a unique opportunity to establish strong links with public health institutes in Africa. The substance of this relationship will be based on trust and mutual benefit. For instance, training workshops and staff exchanges will be organized with the objective of developing appropriate infrastructures that can be directly integrated into the EVAg format and the levels of scientific expertise and quality and range of products that will justify their integration into EVAg as full partners within the consortium.",
