            "text": "Viral pseudotyped particles (pp) are enveloped virus particles, typically derived from retroviruses or rhabdoviruses, that harbor heterologous envelope glycoproteins on their surface and a genome lacking essential genes. These synthetic viral particles are safer surrogates of native viruses and acquire the tropism and host entry pathway characteristics governed by the heterologous envelope glycoprotein used. They have proven to be very useful tools used in research with many applications, such as enabling the study of entry pathways of enveloped viruses and to generate effective gene-delivery vectors. The basis for their generation lies in the capacity of some viruses, such as murine leukemia virus (MLV), to incorporate envelope glycoproteins of other viruses into a pseudotyped virus particle. These can be engineered to contain reporter genes such as luciferase, enabling quantification of virus entry events upon pseudotyped particle infection with susceptible cells. Here, we detail a protocol enabling generation of MLV-based pseudotyped particles, using the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike (S) as an example of a heterologous envelope glycoprotein to be incorporated. We also describe how these particles are used to infect susceptible cells and to perform a quantitative infectivity readout by a luciferase assay.",

These synthetic enveloped viruses are derived from a parental virus, usually a rhabdovirus or a retrovirus, which forms the core of the particle that can incorporate in its membrane a wide range of viral envelope glycoproteins from heterologous viruses. Several model viruses such as the retroviral murine leukemia virus (MLV) and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) or the rhabdoviral vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) have been successfully used to generate viral pseudotyped particles (also named pseudoviruses or pseudovirions). Virus pseudotyping is particularly useful for the following scenarios: (i) to quantify the viral entry process of enveloped viruses using reporter genes like green fluorescent protein (GFP) or luciferase, (ii) to study host cell entry of enveloped viruses that cannot be cultivated in cell culture, (iii) to study entry pathways of risk group (RG) 3 or 4 viral pathogens when biosafety level (BSL) 3 or 4 facilities are not available, (iv) to generate cells stably expressing a specific gene of interest or for specific gene silencing, (v) to produce vectors for gene delivery allowing control over cell tropism. Pseudotyped particles can be used to complement native virus infection assays, especially regarding study of virus entry events.",

            "text": "The protocol described here is highly adaptable both in terms of scale of production and type of envelope glycoprotein that can be incorporated. It has been extensively used in our research on viral entry of various enveloped viruses, including VSV (Sun et al., 2008) , influenza virus (Tse et al., 2014) and coronaviruses (Belouzard et al., 2009; Millet and Whittaker 2014; Millet et al., 2016) . We have successfully used this method to pseudotype viral envelope glycoproteins from all three classes of viral fusion proteins: influenza hemagglutinin (HA, class I), coronavirus spike (S, class I), Ebola glycoprotein (GP, class I), Semliki forest virus (SFV) E1 (class II), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G glycoprotein (class III). The technique described here is based on work performed by Bartosch and colleagues (Bartosch et al., 2003) , and employs the so-called 'three-plasmid' co-transfection strategy in which producer HEK-293T/17 cells are co-transfected with the following plasmids: a plasmid allowing expression of MLV retroviral core genes gag and pol but lacking the MLV envelope glycoprotein-encoding env gene, a transfer vector containing a luciferase reporter gene flanked by retroviral regulatory LTR regions and a packaging signal, along with a plasmid allowing expression of the desired envelope glycoprotein. The coexpression of these three plasmids allows synthesis of LTR-flanked reporter gene-containing RNA, MLV-derived proteins and heterologous envelope glycoprotein. During pseudotyped particle formation, which occurs at the plasma membrane, the RNAs containing the LTRflanked luciferase gene get incorporated into nascent particles formed by assembly and budding of MLV capsid proteins that also recruit heterologous viral envelope glycoproteins. Upon infection in susceptible cells, the pseudotyped virus entry pathway is solely governed by the heterologous virus envelope glycoprotein used. As such, pseudovirions are excellent surrogates to study the entry pathway of enveloped viruses. Once virus entry has occurred, the pseudotyped virus RNAs are released in the cell and the retroviral reverse transcriptase and integrase then reverse transcribe the molecules into double stranded DNA and integrate them into the genome of target cells. Because the sequence that gets integrated only contains the gene encoding the luciferase reporter but none of the MLV genes, the pseudotyped particles are inherently safer as they only allow for one round of infection. After infection, a simple luciferase assay allows quantification of infectivity of the pseudotyped particle studied.",

In this protocol, Huh-7 cells were chosen as target cells for infection by pseudotyped particles because they are very permissive to both native MERS-CoV and MERS-CoV S-pseudotyped particle infection. When producing other types of pseudovirions, we recommend to check what is the most suitable cell line for infectivity assays. As cell lines are the basis for production of pseudotyped particles and for infection assays, it is essential that they are maintained as well as possible by passaging them frequently to avoid having overgrown cell monolayers, using freshly made media as much as possible, and using low passage cells when transfecting or infecting them. Poor cell line health and growth often results in low transfection and infection rates, so it is important to exercise care when handling cells.",

This can also be scaled to the needs of an experiment, for example for high-throughput experiments, the assay can be optimized for infections carried out in 96-well plates by adjusting volumes and using a plate-compatible luminometer. 6. Pseudotyped particle production controls During production of pseudotyped particles, it is important to include particle production controls, an important step that is detailed in this protocol. Typically, 'bald' or '\u0394env' particles (\u0394envpp) are produced by replacing the plasmid encoding the heterologous viral enveloped glycoprotein with an empty vector control. These particles bud out of producer cells, but are devoid of viral envelope glycoproteins. Also, a positive control is also useful to gauge how well the procedure was performed, and typically VSV-Gpseudotyped particles (VSV-Gpp) are used for this. These particles usually reach very high infectivity in many cell types and are thus ideal positive controls.",
