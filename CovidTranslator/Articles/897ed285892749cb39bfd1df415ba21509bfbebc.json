            "text": "Patients with viral pneumonia commonly present with fever, cough, headache, and myalgia. Compared to patients with bacterial or mixed bacterial-viral pneumonia, patients with pure viral pneumonia are less likely to have a productive cough with expectoration. 3 Other clinical and radiologic parameters including routine laboratory values and chest radiograph findings are similar between viral and bacterial CAP. 3 Overall, the most common causes of viral pneumonia are influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus and parainfluenza virus. 3, 4 With the increased use of nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT), other viruses including metapneumovirus, rhinovirus and coronaviruses have been identified. 5 In the immunocompromised or debilitated host, additional viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV) are important causes of pneumonia. CMV is the most common cause of viral pneumonia in the immunocompromised host and prophylactic antiviral therapy is commonly administered in patients who are at risk for reactivation. 6 RSV is also an important cause of morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed patients. 7 Finally, some vaccinepreventable diseases such as measles pneumonia have increased in prevalence due to low vaccination rates in some populations and increased international travel. 8 Laboratory diagnosis of viral pneumonia is usually accomplished through routine testing in the microbiology laboratory using cell culture, antigen detection methods, and increasingly, NAATs such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 4 Despite the widespread availability of these testing options, viral infections are not always suspected initially and pathologists may therefore play an important role in confirming the presence of infection in histologic and cytologic specimens. In particular, pathologists play an important role in diagnosis of viral respiratory infections at autopsy. 7",

            "text": "General tissue responses to viral infections of the lung include interstitial inflammation, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and necrotizing bronchitis/bronchiolitis (Table 1) . 7, 9 DAD is commonly seen with many respiratory virus infections, and may be observed in the acute, or more commonly, late (organizing) stages. Acute DAD is characterized by intra-alveolar edema ( Fig. 1 ) followed by fibrin deposition and formation of hyaline membranes lining the alveolar walls (Fig. 2 ). In the organizing stage, type II pneumocyte proliferation, granulation tissue, and eventually collagen deposition are seen (Fig. 3 ). In addition to DAD, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, and RSV are commonly associated with interstitial pneumonia characterized by leukocytic infiltration of the alveolar septa 10 (Fig. 4) while the members of the Herpesviridae (CMV, HSV, VZV) and Adenoviridae (Adenovirus) are associated with necrotizing bronchiolitis. Some viruses such as CMV, HSV, VZV and adenovirus also produce characteristic aggregates of nucleoproteins and virions called inclusions as they proliferate within cells (Fig. 5 ). 9 The location (i.e. intranuclear, intracytoplasmic) and characteristics of these inclusions allow for detection and presumptive identification of the etiologic virus (Table 1) . 7, 9 Intranuclear inclusions surrounded a clear halo and marginated peripheral chromatin are commonly referred to as \"Cowdry A\" type inclusions and are characteristic of CMV infection (Fig. 5) . However, the halo is a non-specific artifact of formalin or ethanol fixation and may be seen with the intranuclear inclusions of other viruses as well. Another cytologic change observed with some viruses (e.g. RSV, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, measles) is fusion of infected cells and creation of characteristic multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs). 9 Multinucleated giant cells may also be seen with HSV and VZV infection, but this occurs primarily in stratified squamous epithelium. 7 Given the potential overlap of morphologic features, immunohistochemical (IHC) or in situ hybridization (ISH) stains are commonly used to confirm the identity of the suspected virus when inclusions are seen. These stains are also useful for identifying respiratory viruses that do not produce characteristic cytopathic features such as influenza A and B viruses. While some IHC stains are commercially available (e.g. HSV, VZV, CMV, adenovirus), others are available only through specialized research centers and public health laboratories such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). PCR may also be performed on fresh or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections, although commercial availability of this testing is limited.",

Less commonly, humans can become infected with avian influenza viruses, including the highly pathogenic Asian avian influenza A (H5N1) virus. 11 Influenza viruses are a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, particularly during winter months, and have been detected in 14-64% of patients hospitalized for pneumonia. 3, [12] [13] [14] The severity of disease varies each year with the circulating strains and vaccine effectiveness. In general, influenza is estimated to cause 200,000 hospitalizations and 36,000 deaths. 10 Treatment is largely supportive, although antivirals such as oseltamivir may be useful if administered early in infection. 15 Given that the clinical and pathologic features of influenza A and influenza B infection are indistinguishable, 15 they are discussed together in this section.",

Unlike most other viruses involving the lung, CMVinfected cells have both intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions. The intranuclear inclusion is large and commonly surrounded by a halo and a prominent rim of marginated host chromatin, providing the classic \"owl's eye\" appearance (Cowdry type A inclusion). The intracytoplasmic inclusions are smaller, variable in size, and may be indistinct or well-defined. Interestingly, intracytoplasmic inclusions stain faintly with PAS and GMS, and thus may be mistaken for intracellular yeasts. The intranuclear inclusion is PAS and GMS negative.

Fortunately, VZV infection rates have dropped significantly since the introduction of universal childhood vaccination in 1995. 7, 19 Patients with varicella pneumonia typically present with fever, tachypnea, cough, and dyspnea within 6 days of the primary vesicular eruption. 25 Hemoptysis and pleuritic chest pain may also be present. 25 The presence of deep tracheal/bronchial ulcerations may portent a worse prognosis. 25 Patients are treated with acyclovir. 19 ",

In tissue biopsy, the histologic response is similar across viruses resulting mostly in various stage of DAD or an interstitial pneumonia with mixed acute and chronic inflammatory infiltrate. Necrotizing bronchiolitis is common and often the clue to search for viral cytopathic changes when present in the backdrop of DAD. Several viruses have characteristic features allowing for their specific identification. However, some features such as multinucleation and Cowdry A inclusions are shared by various viruses and therefore immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization stains are necessary for the identification of the specific virus. Furthermore, many viruses do not cause cytopathic changes and their presence requires high degree of suspicion with confirmation using other methods including conventional microbiology tests. When reporting our findings, we typically first state the morphologic findings followed by either a definitive diagnosis of a virus, as defined by the cytopathic changes and/or ancillary studies or if not definitive, the cytopathic findings and the most likely associated virus. An example of report could read as \"Acute necrotizing bronchiolitis and organizing diffuse alveolar damage. Herpes simplex viral inclusions identified, confirmed with immunohistochemical study\". ",
