Among these emerging diseases, AIDS has become a global threat to human health. The discovery of a membrane fusion inhibitor has made HIV-1 Env an important target for anti-HIV-1 chemotherapy (Chan et al., 1997; Eckert and Kim, 2001; Este and Telenti, 2007; Poveda et al., 2005; Weissenhorn et al., 1997) . Recently, a new class of inhibitor that blocks the interaction between Env and its co-receptor, CCR5, has been developed (Santoro et al., 2004) . A simple phenotyping method of Env-mediated membrane fusion will facilitate progress in the development of new inhibitors or in the evaluation of drugresistant mutants (Olson and Maddon, 2003) .",

            "text": "A phenotyping method of HIV-1 Env requires a system that generates a measurable signal upon membrane fusion either in a cell-cell or virus-cell system. The methods described employ materials, such as visible dyes, transcription factors, and selfcomplementing enzyme fragments, that produce a signal when they transfer from one compartment to another via membrane fusion (Barbeau et al., 1998; Blumenthal et al., 2002; Feng et al., 1996; Furuta et al., 2006; Holland et al., 2004; Huerta et al., 2002; Jun and Wickner, 2007; Lin et al., 2005 Lin et al., , 2003 Monck and Fernandez, 1992; Sakamoto et al., 2003) . The development of a versatile, cell-based membrane fusion assay system is described in this report. The system employs a modified green fluorescent protein (GFP), split GFP (spGFP), which has been engineered to have the capacity for self-assembly (Cabantous et al., 2005) . The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (Lemmon, 2008) was fused at the N-termini of spGFPs so as to focus the signal in the membrane regions. These spGFPs become fluorescent only when they have reassociated with each other (Cabantous et al., 2005) during the membrane fusion. Unlike an enzyme-based assay, this spGFP system allows real-time monitoring of the membrane fusion process without any additional substrates.",

The primary sequences of the PH domain and GFPopt 1-11 are shown in Fig. 1A . Both amplicons were cloned and sequenced in pCR4Blunt-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). GFPopt 1-11 was split into GFP 1-10 (1-642 base pairs) and GFP 11 (643-696 base pairs), at a point between the 10th and 11th \u2424-sheets of the GFP. The subscripts 1-10 and 11 reflect this location. The PH-GFP 1-10 and PH-GFP 11 genes were generated by combining the PH domain gene with the spGFP genes. These genes were then cloned to pdEGFP, which was constructed by deleting the EGFP gene in pEGFP-N2 (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, USA) (Fig. 1B) .

The green sig-nal was observed at the plasma membrane surrounding several red nuclei (Fig. 4A) . The red nuclei were derived from the 293FT cells expressing Env as pNHcRedEluc expressed the nuclear-localizing HcRed proteins. The unique localization of green signal in the membrane region made it easy to differentiate the real signal from the non-specific autofluorescence background. Furthermore, the nonenvelope-mediated spontaneous fusions, if they occurred, could be ruled out by the absence of red nuclei in the syncytia.

The dye-mediated fusion assay requires preloading of dyes before the fusion reaction (Blumenthal et al., 2002) . A quantitative fusion assay using enzymes, either as preexpressed self-complementing enzyme fragments or as induced reporter enzymes, requires the addition of enzyme substrates to monitor the processes (Cavrois et al., 2002; Holland et al., 2004; Jun and Wickner, 2007) . Furthermore, if a particular substrate is membrane impermeable, continuous monitoring of the same sample is impossible because the cells have to be lysed for the assay.",

If one can clone the envelope genes from clinical samples into an appropriate expression vector, this system may be useful for detecting a minor population of Env that possesses the different co-receptor usage. Such a tropism assay can be easily adapted by using CCR5/CD4+ cells together with CXCR4/CD4+ cells. Similar identification of fusion foci can be achieved if GFP is used as a reporter gene in a transcriptional factor transfer assay, such as T7 RNA polymerase or Tat (Barbeau et al., 1998; Feng et al., 1996; Lin et al., 2005; Sakamoto et al., 2003) , but the need for de novo transcription/translation steps may result in a longer lag time for signal generation. Of course, membrane fusion by viruses other than HIV-1 can be monitored easily.",
