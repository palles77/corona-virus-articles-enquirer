            "text": "Background: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of respiratory pathogens among newborns admitted to a neonatal medium care unit (NMcU) and to identify clinical predictors. Methods: a 1-y observational study was performed of neonates admitted to an NMcU in amsterdam, The Netherlands. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected for the detection of respiratory viruses and bacteria by real-time PcR (RT-PcR). cycle threshold (ct) values were provided to estimate viral load. Predictors for the presence of study pathogens were identified. results: From October 2010 through september 2011, 334 neonates (median age 1.3 d, 53.6% male) were included. Overall, 37 respiratory pathogens were detected in 34 children (10.2%): parainfluenza-1 (n = 9), human rhinovirus (n = 7), parainfluenza-3 (n = 6), respiratory syncytial virus (RsV, n = 6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 3), adenovirus (n = 2), human coronavirus (n = 2), influenza a (n = 1), and bocavirus (n = 1). Neonates with higher viral loads (ct <35; n = 11) were more often clinically ill than those with lower viral loads (ct \u226535; n = 23). Two variables significantly contributed to the detection of study pathogens: age (odds ratio (OR) 1.21 for each day older; 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.30) and rhinorrhea (OR 6.71; 95% confidence interval 1.54-29.21). conclusion: Respiratory pathogens seem to play a role in neonates admitted to an NMcU.

One of the most important infectious disease syndromes in newborns is neonatal sepsis, with an estimated incidence of 1.5% during the first 72 h of life (2) . Most infants with sepsis present with nonspecific signs and symptoms. The most common of these vague signs are temperature instability, lethargy, apnea, and poor feeding (3, 4) . Neonates with respiratory tract infection can present with a clinical picture that is consistent with sepsis, in addition to more classical symptoms such as tachypnea and hypoxemia (5) .",

Less common pathogens, including the more recently identified bocavirus, have also been detected in infants with acute respiratory infection (7, 8) . However, the prevalence of infection with respiratory pathogens in neonates, and therefore the extent of the clinical problem in this fragile pediatric population, remains largely unknown. Therefore, we aimed to determine the prevalence of respiratory pathogens, both viruses and some bacteria, among a population of neonates admitted to a neonatal medium care unit (NMCU) during a 1-y period. Secondary objectives were to compare the clinical course of neonates with and without respiratory pathogens and to identify risk factors and predictors for the presence of those pathogens.",

Median age at hospitalization was 1.3 d, 53.6% were male, and the median duration of admission was 4 d. Eighty-eight children (26.3%) were delivered preterm (i.e., <37 wk) and 99 (29.6%) were born after prolonged rupture of membranes (i.e., >24 h). Three hundred and nine neonates (92.5%) were admitted to the NMCU within 72 h from birth, and they were almost exclusively admitted from Articles Smit et al. hospital labor and delivery; the remaining 25 (7.5%) were mostly transferred from home, with some from other hospitals. Undifferentiated perinatal infection (i.e., perinatal infection of unknown origin) was diagnosed in 79 newborns (23.7%), whereas a diagnosis of perinatal sepsis was established in 5 (1.5%); antibiotics were given to 108 (32.3%). These and other relevant characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . Of note, a specific diagnosis (i.e., infection or other diagnosis) was made for 227 neonates during admission; the remaining 107 neonates were merely clinically observed because of premature age (n = 21) or delivery complications (n = 86) such as prolonged rupture of membranes, cesarean section, assisted vaginal delivery, or maternal fever during delivery. As displayed in Table 1 , 8 of 138 performed blood cultures (5.8%) were positive for bacterial pathogens. The following bacteria were cultured: Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 2), Micrococcus lylae (n = 1), Escherichia coli (n = 1), Streptococcus sanguis (n = 1), and Staphylococcus capitis (n = 1).",

Table 2 demonstrates the study pathogens that were identified via real-time PCR (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal aspirates in all newborn children who were admitted during the 1-y study period to the NMCU department of our hospital. Overall, 37 pathogens were detected in 34 children, who comprise 10.2% of the total population. Mean cycle threshold (Ct) value of positive samples was 34.59 (SD 8.48). Twenty-one percent of study pathogens were identified in the month of December, with parainfluenza viruses being detected in 5 of 10 positive samples. Regarding the entire study period, parainfluenza-1 (n = 9), human rhinovirus (n = 7), parainfluenza-3 (n = 6), and RSV (n = 6) were most frequently detected. Human rhinovirus was the most frequently detected pathogen in October (three of four instances); parainfluenza viruses comprised almost half of the identified pathogens in November and December (7 of 15); and RSV showed its peak activity in January (four of six). Although Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 3) had been detected as a bacterial pathogen by RT-PCR, blood cultures remained negative. Influenza B, parainfluenza-2, parainfluenza-4, human metapneumovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella species were not detected at all. The two coronaviruses that were detected were human coronavirus OC43 and NL63.",

Besides the study populations not being entirely comparable, another explanation for this discrepancy might be the fact that we had noticed a milder than usual RSV epidemic in the winter of 2010-2011 among children in our hospital in general. RT-PCR has been used as the diagnostic method in our study, as opposed to other neonatal studies (8) (9) (10) . In a study comparing multiplex PCR assays and conventional techniques for diagnosing respiratory virus infections in children admitted to the hospital with an acute respiratory illness, PCR was more sensitive and had the advantages of a shorter delay in specific diagnosis and a lower cost than immunofluorescence or culture (14) . Another study concluded that RT-PCR for respiratory viruses was found to be a sensitive and reliable method in pediatric intensive care unit patients with lower respiratory tract infection, with a twofold increase in the diagnostic yield as compared with conventional methods (15) . However, a limitation of the use of PCR assays has been acknowledged by studies showing that asymptomatic carriage of a respiratory virus occurs frequently in young children (16) and the presence of viral nucleic acids may not always reflect an association with infectious virus production (17) . This limitation most likely holds true for newborns as well, as is reflected by our findings showing that respiratory pathogens have been detected in 7.5% of neonates without respiratory symptoms. In addition, blood cultures remained negative in three children of whom nasopharyngeal aspirates tested positive for S. pneumoniae by RT-PCR in our study. Asymptomatic colonization with this specific bacterial pathogen has been demonstrated by Bisgaard et al. in 9% of neonates born from mothers with asthma (18) . In general, the Ct value may be of help in differentiating symptomatic from asymptomatic infections. Our data show that neonates in whom respiratory samples tested positive and contained lower Ct levels (i.e., higher viral loads) indeed were more often clinically ill than neonates with low viral loads. Regardless, our study design does not really allow us to draw conclusions regarding asymptomatic carriership because all the neonates from our population were hospitalized, and therefore we did not have a true \"asymptomatic\" comparison group.",

Birth at the onset of the RSV season and other environmental factors, such as the presence of (school-aged) siblings and day care attendance, have also been designated as significant risk factors for severe RSV infection (20, 21) .

In addition, from a cost-effectiveness study, it has been shown that treatment of children aged 0-36 mo with lower respiratory tract infection causes a considerable economic burden, which is for the most part caused by (duration of) hospitalization (24) . Studies on the value of RT-PCR diagnostics in children have shown conflicting results as to whether the introduction of this method as a diagnostic tool for neonatal infection might be of benefit (25, 26) . The results of our study, in which all pediatricians were blinded to the RT-PCR results, show that median duration of clinical admission was 1 d shorter among those neonates with a positive result (nonsignificant difference; P = 0.089). Other variables, relating to clinical course and outcome, were comparable between the two groups. Therefore, for neonates hospitalized with nonspecific signs and symptoms, the possible advantage of performing RT-PCR assays for the detection of respiratory pathogens remains to be elucidated. Of note here, we did show that positive blood cultures, which are considered to be the ultimate proof of bacterial infection, were not seen at all among neonates with a nasopharyngeal aspirate positive for respiratory pathogens as detected by RT-PCR. This might be a cautious argument in support of withholding antibiotics or decreasing their use when respiratory viruses as the etiological agents are detected using RT-PCR assays on respiratory samples.",

            "text": "There are some limitations of our study that need to be discussed. First, although we are the first to describe a neonatal population in a medium care setting, we have restricted ourselves to milder cases as compared with neonates admitted to an intensive care setting. It would be interesting and useful to repeat our research among unselected neonates who are hospitalized, irrespective of the intensity of the provided care. Another limitation is that we have identified only 34 neonates with a respiratory pathogen. Even though this comprises 10.2% of the total population, the absolute numbers that were used for the analyses are relatively small, especially when considering the detected pathogens separately. To increase the power to detect any relevant difference between groups, a longer follow-up period would be of added value. A last limitation is that our study design does not yet allow us to draw solid conclusions on the usefulness of RT-PCR, and therefore its role in clinical practice. Only a randomized controlled trial would give us definite answers.",

Parainfluenza viruses, rhinovirus, and RSV were most important with respect to frequency of detection. Increasing age and symptoms of rhinorrhea significantly contributed to an increased risk of detection of any respiratory pathogen. Therefore, practitioners might be advised to consider ordering respiratory viral/bacterial testing of nasopharyngeal specimens in neonates with rhinorrhea, especially when they are older. There was no significant difference regarding use of antibiotics or duration of hospital stay; however, pediatricians were blinded to RT-PCR results. The question of whether clinical management will be influenced by the knowledge of respiratory viruses being present in respiratory samples of newborn children remains to be answered.",

Multiplex RT-PCRs were performed for parainfluenza 1-4, human coronavirus OC43/229E/NL63, influenza A and B virus, adenovirus, human rhinovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Monoplex RT-PCRs were performed for RSV, human metapneumovirus, Legionella species, bocavirus, and S. pneumoniae. Phocine herpesvirus and equine arteritis virus were spiked to the clinical samples and used as internal controls to monitor nucleic acid isolation and inhibition of the RT-PCR (27) . Ct values were provided for each positive result in order to estimate viral load, with lower Ct values corresponding to higher viral loads. All pediatricians and pediatric residents that were involved with delivered patient care were blinded to the RT-PCR results.",

If a significant contribution was found for any of the independent factors in the univariate analysis, they were added as variables to a logistic regression model.
