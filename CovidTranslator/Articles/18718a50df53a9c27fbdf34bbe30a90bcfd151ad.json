Experience has shown that professionals with specific training in Intensive Care Medicine are needed to provide high quality care to critically ill patients. In Europe, important steps have been taken towards the standardization of training programs of the different member states. However, it is now necessary to take one more step forward, that is, the creation of a primary specialty in Intensive Care Medicine. Care of the critically ill needs to be led by specialists who have received specific and complete training and who have the necessary professional competences to provide maximum quality care to their patients. The future of the specialty presents challenges that must be faced with determination, with the main objective of meeting the needs of the population.",

In each country the course taken has been influenced by the prevalent conditions in each case, and the existence of previous structures and resistances has often affected the development of Intensive Care Medicine. 1 In a recent article published in Critical Care, Du et al. described the evolution of Intensive Care Medicine in China. 2 A number of revealing points should be commented about this article. The first Intensive Care Units (ICUs) were created in the 1980s, and were initially staffed by surgeons, internists, emergency care physicians and anesthetists lacking specific training, with some learned skills, but with no global vision of the critically ill patient. The article describes how during the 1990s the \"traditional specialties\" were reluctant to consider the existence of a proprietary body of knowledge in Intensive Care Medicine, and preferred to retain the \"property\" of what they regarded as \"their\" critical patients -rejecting in 1996 the creation of a scientific society to cover this new discipline.",

This proved decisive for securing official recognition of the specialty of Intensive Care Medicine in 2009. Now, residents can chose Intensive Care Medicine as a primary specialty on coming out of Medical School, or alternatively may specialize in Intensive Care Medicine as a sub-specialty after completing their training program in Internal Medicine, Anesthesiology, General Surgery or Emergency Care Medicine. At present, work is being done to homogenize training and accreditation in Intensive Care Medicine in the context of a common program for the entire country.",

They describe the expansion of intensive care throughout the world, but also point out the differences that exist among different geographical settings, both as refers to the impact of critical disease and as regards the availability of resources needed to care for such patients. The reasons why the global epidemiology of critical disease remains little understood are discussed. The tendency is towards a growing imbalance between the demand and offer of intensive care worldwide -this making it necessary to ponder questions such as the prioritization of care, and to place greater emphasis on prevention and the early detection of potentially serious disease processes. The authors in turn underscore the ease with which natural disasters, epidemics and human conflicts can quickly overwhelm the capacity of the healthcare infrastructures and give rise to sanitary crises or even humanitarian catastrophes. Another universal deficiency refers to the training of intensivists, making it necessary to consider alternatives such as telemedicine, and explaining the emigration of professionals -these being circumstances that simply add to the existing regional imbalances.",

They likewise underscored the importance of clinical management: how improvements in the care processes, based on quality programs, and concern over safety, can be as important for improving the patient prognosis as the use of certain treatment interventions. Mention should also be made here of the importance of organizational models based on the intensivist, with a view to securing the best clinical results. 16, 17 E. Palencia Herrej\u00f3n et al In sum, much has been done and many things have changed since the origins of Intensive Care Medicine over 50 years ago. Intensive Care Medicine was born in response to concrete problems and developed as a result of technological advances, though now that the discipline has come of age, what defines it best is a concrete doctrine and a body of knowledge, more than any given technology or location. The scientific contribution made by Intensive Care Medicine in this period of time both in Spain and in the rest of the world has been very important, and clinical research focused on the critical patient must continue in the future as an essential condition for continuous development of the discipline and -most importantly -to guarantee ever increasing quality standards in the management of critically ill patients.",
