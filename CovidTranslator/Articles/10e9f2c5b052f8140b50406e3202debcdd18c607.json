The EMICT periodically reminds staff to undertake personal measures to reduce infection, such as wearing masks at all instances in the radiology department and N95 masks if working in the contaminated area; not touching the mask and the eyes; practicing hand hygiene; facing away from colleagues when eating, drinking, and talking; and not using personal cellular telephones while on duty. 211  212  213  214  215  216  217  218  219  220  221  222  223  224  225  226  227  228  229  230  231  232  233  234  235  236  237  238  239  240  241  242  243  244  245  246  247  248  249  250  251  252  253  254  255  256  257  258  259  260  261  262   263  264  265  266  267  268  269  270  271  272  273  274  275  276  277  278  279  280  281  282  283  284  285  286  287  288  289  290  291  292  293  294  295  296  297  298  299  300  301  302  303  304  305  306  307  308  309  310  311  312  313  314 In addition, the chief thoracic radiologist provided lectures on all radiologists and technologists on typical CT findings of COVID-19 infection using materials developed in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak in China.",

Currently, the Chinese people are panicking again. The speed and extent by which COVID-19 has spread in 2 months are unprecedented, beyond those of severe acute respiratory syndrome, and this has been aided by its contagious nature and rapid spread via droplets and contact. The droplet mode of transmission means that a person can be infected easily by means of casual contact or even fomites on contaminated environmental surfaces. Another theory has yet to be proved: aerosol propagation. How radiology departments respond to any infectious disease outbreak is determined primarily by the estimated risk of cross-infection to the staff and other patients. Appropriate precautions taken only by staff in direct contact with patients may be adequate when the risk is low. The strongest measures need to be implemented to limit the spread of the disease when the risk is high. With severe infectious diseases such as COVID-19, the highest level of infection control measures must be implemented; these include providing adequate standard protective equipment, training staff, and instituting proper emergency plans.",

In our opinion, the major role of chest CT is to understand the extent and dynamic evolution of lung lesions induced by COVID-19. The reasons we adopted the lowdose chest CT scan protocol are as follows: low-dose chest CT has been widely used in the screening of early lung cancer. It is well known that many early lung cancers are ground-glass opacities, so we believe that low-dose screening is also applicable for COVID-19. In addition, considering the rapid development of COVID-19, many CT examinations may be conducted in the same individual to monitor disease progress.
