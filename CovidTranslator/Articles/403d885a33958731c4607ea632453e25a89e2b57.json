Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California 27 serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States. While LACV infection is often 28 asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly. Unfortunately, no antivirals 29 have been approved to treat LACV infection. Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential 30 antivirals against LACV infection. From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral 31 molecules, including known antivirals. Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that 32 exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability. Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, 33 was among our top targets. We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in 34 multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or 35 infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a 36 known determinant of LACV entry. We extended these results to other ionophores and found that 37 the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families including bunyaviruses (Rift 38 Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika), 39 and coronaviruses (229E and MERS-CoV). In all viral infections, we observed significant 40 reductions in virus titer in valinomycin-treated cells. In sum, we demonstrate the importance of 41 potassium ions to virus infection, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus 42 replication. 43 44 Importance 45 No antivirals are approved for the treatment of bunyavirus infection.

Additionally, 93 numerous approved and available drugs are already available that can be repurposed as 94 antivirals 18, 19 .

Thus, 128 our assay identified molecules with novel activity against LACV, including some recognized 129 antivirals. 130 131 Valinomycin restricts LACV replication. We focused on valinomycin, as the molecule was a 132 prominent hit in our screen, had a known mechanism relevant to LACV infection, and was not 133 previously described to have antiviral activity against LACV. As an initial consideration of its 134 antiviral activity, we performed secondary screening on Huh7 cells. Cells were seeded to 135 confluency, treated with increasing doses of valinomycin, from 1 to 64 \u00b5M, and infected at MOI 136 0.1. At 48h, cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet, and stain was quantified by absorbance 137 reading. We observed that valinomycin exhibited antiviral activity at doses above 10 \u00b5M, as crystal 138 violet staining was stronger, suggesting more surviving cells (Figure 2A ). Doses as high as 64 \u00b5M 139 did not affect crystal violet stain, suggesting that cellular viability was not compromised. To 140 confirm this phenotype with titers, we treated cells with increasing doses of valinomycin 2h prior 141 to infection at MOI 0.1 and measured titers by plaque assay at 48 hpi. We observed that viral 142 titers were significantly decreased compared to untreated controls ( Figure 2B , dotted line) at 143 concentrations above 1 \u00b5M. In fact, viral titers were reduced over 100-fold at 10 \u00b5M. We calculated 144 an IC50 value of 1.4 \u00b5M. To confirm that cellular viability was not compromised, we used a 145 fluorescent assay to measure cellular ATP content after treatment with increasing doses of 146 valinomycin. We observed cellular toxicity at doses at and above 16 \u00b5M ( Figure 2C , CC50 value 147 of 14 \u00b5M), though no toxicity was observed either by cellular morphology or fluorescent ATP assay 148 below 10 \u00b5M. 149 150 As further confirmation of valinomycin's antiviral activity, we measured cell-associated viral 151 genomes.

Paralleling our titer data, valinomycin 154 treatment reduced viral genome content in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 2D ). Viral genome 155 content was reduced upwards of 100-fold with 10 \u00b5M valinomycin treatment. To extend these 156 results to other cell types, we treated and infected Vero-E6 cells as above and determined viral 157 titers by plaque assay at 48 hpi. Again, we observed a significant reduction in viral titer with an 158 in multiple cell types, reducing both viral titers and cell-associated viral genomes in a dose-160 dependent manner. 161 162 Valinomycin is antiviral over multiple rounds of infection. Our initial assays were performed 163 at low MOI and viral titer measured at 48 hpi. To determine if valinomycin was antiviral over 164 several rounds of replication, we treated Huh7 cells with 2 \u00b5M valinomycin two hours prior to 165 infection at MOI 0.1 and subsequently collected samples to titer every 8h for 56h total. We found 166 that LACV titers were significantly reduced at all times after 8 hpi ( Figure 3A ); in fact, virus failed 167 to replicate above input virus titers (0h). To confirm that valinomycin was reducing virus 168 replication, we measured viral RNA genomes. To this end, we treated cells with increasing doses 169 of valinomycin, infected with LACV and collected cell-associated RNA in Trizol at 24 hpi. After 170 purifying and reverse-transcribing, we performed qPCR using primers specific to the small, 171 medium, and large genome segments. We observed that treatment with valinomycin significantly 172 reduced the number of viral genomes by >90% with treatment and that no individual genome 173 segment was affected more than another ( Figure 3B ). Together, these data suggest that 174 valinomycin blocks virus replication and reduces viral RNA accumulation. 175 176 Valinomycin does not reduce viral particle infectivity. Because we observe significant 177 reductions in LACV titers with valinomycin treatment, we hypothesized that valinomycin might be 178 directly affecting cellular processes to reduce virus infection. Nonetheless, valinomycin is a cyclic 179 peptide and could potentially directly inactivate viral particles, as seen previously 20 . To test 180 whether valinomycin directly reduced virus infectivity, we directly incubated LACV with 2 \u00b5M 181 valinomycin for 24h and directly titered the surviving virus at regular intervals. We found that 182 valinomycin did not significantly alter viral titer over the time examined ( Figure 4A ), suggesting 183 that valinomycin is not directly inactivating viral particles. We further examined the capacity of 184 valinomycin to inactivate particles by incubating with increasing doses, up to 10 \u00b5M valinomycin, 185 for 24h prior to directly titering. As in our timecourse, we observed no significant change in viral 186 titers at any dose ( Figure 4B ), again suggesting that valinomycin does not directly inactivate LACV 187 particles. As final confirmation of this phenotype, we measured viral RNA in viruses exposed to 188 increasing doses of valinomycin. We then compared the relative number of genomes to the titer 189 to calculate the genome-to-PFU ratio. We observed that this number did not change with 190 valinomycin treatment, suggesting no change in specific infectivity ( Figure 4C ). In sum, these data 191 suggest that valinomycin does not affect virus infectivity by directly acting on the virion. 192 193 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

We thus hypothesized that valinomycin's antiviral 194 activity was due to its effect on the cell. The role of potassium in bunyavirus infection has been 195 well-documented, and bunyavirus entry is potassium dependent 21, 22 . To test if valinomycin was  196   affecting the cell rather than the virus, we treated Huh7 cells with 2 \u00b5M valinomycin and,  197 immediately before infection, we washed away the drug. As a control, we maintained valinomycin 198 on cells or replaced the valinomycin after washing away the initial treatment. We observed that 199 even after removing and washing valinomycin from the cells, the antiviral activity persisted, as 200 viral titers remained reduced to the same level as when valinomycin treatment is concurrent with 201 infection ( Figure 4D ). Together, these data suggest that valinomycin does not directly inactivate 202 viral particles but that treatment of cells reduces LACV infection, potentially by disrupting 203 potassium-dependent entry. 204",

Marituba virus (MTBV) infection results in a sodium ion influx 23 , but the 209 origin or function of these ionic changes are not known. To determine if other ionophores might 210 exhibit antiviral activity, we treated cells with increasing doses of nonactin (potassium and sodium 211 ionophore), nigericin (hydrogen and potassium ionophore), calcium ionophore I, and sodium 212 ionophore III ( Figure 5A ). Two hours later, we infected with LACV at MOI 0.01 and measured viral 213 titers at 48 hpi. Both nonactin and nigericin exhibited significant antiviral activity, and viral titers 214 were not measurable above 4 and 1 \u00b5M, respectively ( Figure 5B ). Treatment with sodium 215 ionophore III resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in viral titers, and virus was not recovered 216 above 10 \u00b5M. Interestingly, treatment with calcium ionophore I showed no changes in viral titer, 217 even at the highest dose. Thus, we observe that LACV replication is disrupted by several 218 ionophores, especially potassium ionophores, highlighting the role for potassium in virus infection.

            "text": "the largest family of viruses, composed of hundreds of members. These 59 segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses are transmitted primarily by an arthropod vector, and 60 several family members pose significant threats to human health. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) 61 frequently infects humans and ruminants, resulting in severe morbidity and mortality. While RVFV 62 is primarily transmitted in Africa and the Middle East, the threat of global spread looms, and recent 63 examples of Zika 1 and chikungunya 2 viruses illustrate this tangible hazard. In addition to RVFV, 64 several other bunyaviruses infect humans and are associated with severe pathologies as well. La 65 Crosse virus (LACV), distantly related to RVFV, is a bunyavirus present primarily in the 66 midwestern and eastern United States 3 . LACV is transmitted by Aedes triseriatus, though Aedes 67 albopictus 4-6 efficiently carries the virus as well. While relatively unknown and frequently 68 undiagnosed, LACV infects and causes neuroinvasive disease in dozens of people every year. In 69 fact, from 2009 to 2018, 679 such cases were reported according to the Centers for Disease 70 Control 7 . Further, LACV cases recently have emerged in the southeastern United States, 71 suggesting spread of the virus 8 . The ability of LACV to infect Aedes albopictus mosquitos will 72 likely lead to its continuing spread. Despite this spread and the severe disease associated with 73 LACV infection, no antivirals or vaccines are available to prevent or treat infection. Thus, LACV 74 presents a significant threat to human health. 75 76 Despite their prevalence, no antivirals are available to treat bunyavirus infection and palliative 77 care is given to patients presenting with LACV encephalitis. While several vaccine candidates 78 have been developed to target RVFV 9-11 , no similar effort has been invested in anti-LACV 79 therapeutics. With the increasing availability of drug panels to screen molecules for antivirals, 80 rapid investigation and deployment of antivirals for emerging viruses is possible. Several prior 81 screens for antivirals have successfully identified lead molecules and highlighted cellular 82 pathways critical to virus infection. For example, recent screens with chikungunya virus 83 highlighted berberine, abamectin, and ivermectin as promising antivirals 12 . Additionally, Zika virus 84 screens have uncovered known and novel antivirals 13-15 , including mycophenolic acid and 85",

            "text": "Valinomycin is broadly antiviral. LACV is related to several other medically-relevant 221 bunyaviruses, including Keystone virus and Rift Valley fever virus. To determine whether these 222 viruses respond to valinomycin treatment, we treated and infected Huh7 cells with these viruses 223 and measured viral titers at 48 hpi. As with LACV, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in 224 viral titers, with titers decreasing greater than 100-fold at concentrations above 2 \u00b5M (Figure 6A). 225To expand beyond bunyaviruses, we performed the same analysis with Zika virus (flavivirus) 226 infection (Figure 6B), Coxsackievirus B3 and human rhinovirus 2 (picornaviruses) (Figure 6C)infected patients, including encephalitic patients, is limited in the scope of available 236 therapeutics. La Crosse virus lacks any approved treatment, and antiviral development could 237 benefit not only LACV-infected patients but perhaps patients infected with related bunyaviruses. 238Unfortunately, antiviral development is a nonlinear process that has provided no promising targets 239 for this specific virus to date. Our screen is the first to investigate a large number (>500) of 240 compounds in their ability to reduce LACV infection in vitro, and our hits demonstrate that several 241 known antivirals may exhibit anti-LACV activity. Additionally, the identification of novel antivirals, 242 such as valinomycin provides novel avenues of antiviral development.243 244 In our screens, valinomycin consistently exhibited antiviral activity and was selected for follow-up 245 experiments. Based on our results, valinomycin is a host-targeted antiviral with broadspectrum 246 activity. In fact, our tests against eight distinct viruses and four diverse families of virus suggest 247 (1) valinomycin has activity against evolutionarily-distant viruses and (2) these viruses rely on this 248 conserved host process for efficient replication. Precisely why each virus is sensitive to 249 valinomycin is likely virus-specific, though mechanisms for bunyaviruses have been 250 described 22,24 . As a potassium ionophore, valinomycin disrupts potassium ion gradients, resulting 251 in aberrant cellular events, including endocytosis. This potassium-dependent endocytosis is 252 required for efficient bunyavirus entry 24 . Additionally, a study using Hazara virus, a distantly 253 related bunyavirus, demonstrated that the viral fusion spike conformation was potassium-254 sensitive 21 . Thus, valinomycin's antiviral activity fits with the prescribed role of potassium ions 255 during virus infection, both highlighting the importance of this pathway for virus infection and its 256 potential as an antiviral target. 257 258 Valinomycin is a naturally occurring cycling peptide, synthesized by Streptomyces species as an 259 antibiotic 25 . In our assays, we did not observe significant cellular toxicity, as measured either by 260 gross cellular morphology or by measuring cellular ATP levels, until doses above 10 \u00b5M, while 261 suggests there is a window of therapeutic potential. However, given the drug's 262 toxicity in vivo, modification of the valinomycin structure may tune toxicity while maintaining 263 antiviral activity. Additionally, using other, less toxic potassium ionophores may similarly function 264 to inhibit LACV infection, as we observed with nonactin and nigericin. For outbreak viruses like 265 SARS CoV or ZIKV, however, limited valinomycin usage might be beneficial. Interestingly, 266 valinomycin was identified in an earlier screen for anti-SARS-CoV molecules 26 , underscoring the 267 antiviral potential of valinomycin despite its negative characteristics. Importantly, the emergence 268 of a new group 2B CoV, nCoV-2019 signals the ongoing threat and need to rapidly respond to 269 novel emergent virues. Additional in vivo testing, combined with medicinal chemistry approaches 270 to structural modification, would be necessary prior to clinical use. 271 272 In addition to valinomycin, our screen identified several tantalizing antiviral candidates. In fact, 273 several known antivirals were identified (summarized in Table 1). Dasatinib has previously been 274 described to inhibit dengue virus and HIV infection 27,28 . Quininone has activity against enterovirus 275 proteases as well as reverse transcriptases 29,30 . As mentioned previously, mitoxantrone was 276 identified in a screen for anti-RVFV molecules 16 . Additionally, we identified a number of cancer 277 therapeutics, targeting processes such as angiogenesis and topoisomerase, that show significant 278 promise. Nonetheless, further verification of antiviral activity and investigation of the mechanisms 279 of action is necessary. Regardless, the development of novel antivirals is crucial to combat virus 280 infection and to respond to the possibility of rapid virus dissemination and evolution. LACV is a 281 significant threat to human health, and continued development of novel antivirals may prove 282 fruitful if the virus were to spread, as arboviruses are wont to do. 283 284 Materials and Methods 285 Cell culture.
