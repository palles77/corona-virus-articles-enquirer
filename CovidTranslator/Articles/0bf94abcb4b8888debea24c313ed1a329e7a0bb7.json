Average human cells are 10-30 \u03bcm (microns) in diameter, which means that they are generally 100 to 1000 times larger than the viruses that are infecting them. However, some viruses are significantly larger than 100 nm. Poxviruses, such as the variola virus that causes smallpox, can approach 400 nm in length, and filoviruses, such as the dangerous Ebola virus and Marburg virus, are only 80 nm in diameter but extend into long threads that can reach lengths of over 1000 nm. Several very large viruses that infect amoebas have recently been discovered: megavirus is 400 nm in diameter, and pandoraviruses have an elliptical or ovoid structure approaching 1000 nm in length. It is a common mistake to think that all viruses are smaller than bacteria; most bacteria are typically 2000-3000 nm in size, but certain strains of bacteria called Mycobacteria can be 10 times smaller than this, putting them in the range of these large viruses. So although a characteristic of viruses is that they are all small in size, this ranges from only a few nanometers to larger than some bacteria ( Fig. 2.1 ).",

The virus disassembles and its genetic material (made of nucleic acid) encodes the instructions for the proteins that will spontaneously assemble into the new virions. This is known as de novo replication, from the Latin for \"from new.\" In contrast to cells, which grow in size and divide equally in two to replicate, viruses use the cell's energy and machinery to create and assemble new virions piece by piece, completely from scratch. 3. The genetic material of viruses can be composed of DNA or RNA. All living cells, whether human, animal, plant, or bacterial, have double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) as their genetic material. Viruses, on the other hand, have genomes, or genetic material, that can be composed of DNA or RNA (but not both). Genomes are not necessarily double-stranded, either; different virus types can also have single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes, and viruses with RNA genomes can be single-stranded or double-stranded. Any particular virus will only have one type of nucleic acid genome, however, and so viruses are not encountered that have both ssDNA and ssRNA genomes, for example. Similarly to how the size of the virus particle varies significantly, the genome size can also vary greatly from virus to virus. A typical virus genome falls in the range of 7000-20,000 base pairs (bp) (7-20 kilobase pairs (kb)). Smaller-sized virions will naturally be able to hold less nucleic acid than larger virions, but large viruses do not necessarily have large genomes. While most viruses do not contain much nucleic acid, some dsDNA viruses have very large genomes: herpesviruses",

In addition, viral genomes are susceptible to damage by ultraviolet radiation or radioactivity, much in the same way that our DNA is. If the nucleic acid genome of the virus is damaged, then it will be unable to produce progeny virions. In order to protect the fragile nucleic acid from this harsh environment, the virus surrounds its nucleic acid with a protein shell, called the capsid, from the Latin capsa, meaning \"box.\" The capsid is composed of one or more different types of proteins that repeat over and over again to create the entire capsid, in the same way that many bricks fit together to form a wall. This repeating structure forms a strong but slightly flexible capsid. Combined with its small size, the capsid is physically very difficult to break open and sufficiently protects the nucleic acid inside of it.

The helix (plural: helices) is a spiral shape that curves cylindrically around an axis. It is also a common biological structure: many proteins have sections that have a helical shape, and DNA is a double-helix of nucleotides. In the case of a helical virus, the viral nucleic acid coils into a helical shape and the capsid proteins wind around the inside or outside of the nucleic acid, forming a long tube or rod-like structure ( Fig. 2.4) . The nucleic acid and capsid constitute the nucleocapsid. In fact, the protein that winds around the nucleic acid is often called the nucleocapsid protein.

Rarely are covalent bonds found in capsids; these are the strongest of bonds that are formed when atoms share electrons with each other. Electrostatic interactions, which are weaker than covalent bonds, occur when two atoms are oppositely charged and therefore attracted to each other, hence the saying \"opposites attract.\" Ionic bonds are electrostatic interactions because they occur between oppositely charged atoms, or ions. Hydrogen bonds are also weak electrostatic forces that occur between slightly charged atoms, usually between hydrogen (slightly positively charged) and another atom that is partially negatively charged, such as oxygen. Van der Waals forces are weak interactions that occur when an atom becomes slightly charged due to random asymmetry of its electrons. The properties of water also contribute to virus assembly and attachment to cells. Water is a polar molecule, meaning that the molecule has two distinct ends, much like a battery or magnet has a positive and a negative end. Molecules that do not have distinct ends are termed nonpolar. Other polar molecules are attracted to water, since water is polar too. These molecules are hydrophilic, meaning \"water loving.\" Molecules that are nonpolar are not attracted to water and are hydrophobic, or \"water avoiding.\" Hydrophobic molecules will therefore aggregate with each other in an aqueous solution. This explains the phenomenon of oil (nonpolar) not mixing with water (polar).",

First, only one type of capsid protein is required. This protein subunit is repeated over and over again to form the capsid. This structure is simple and requires less free energy to assemble than a capsid composed of multiple proteins. In addition, having only one nucleocapsid protein means that only one gene is required instead of several, thereby reducing the length of nucleic acid required.

Your pencil would be right in the middle of a triangle facing up and a triangle facing down. If you rotate the icosahedron clockwise, you will find that in 180 degrees you encounter the same arrangement (symmetry): a triangle facing up and a triangle facing down. Continuing to rotate the icosahedron brings you back to where you began. This is known as the twofold axis of symmetry, because as you rotate the shape along this axis (your pencil), you encounter your starting structure twice in one revolution: once when you begin, and again when rotated 180 degrees. On the other hand, if you put your pencil axis directly through the center one of the small triangle faces of the icosahedron, you will encounter the initial view two additional times as you rotate the shape, for a total of three times. This is the threefold axis. Similarly, if your pencil axis goes through a vertex (or tip) of the icosahedron, you will find symmetry five times in one rotation, forming the fivefold axis. It is for this reason that an icosahedron is known to have 2-3-5 symmetry, because it has twofold, threefold, and fivefold axes of symmetry. This terminology is useful when dealing with an icosahedral virus because it can be used to indicate specific locations on the virus or where the virion has interactions with the cell surface. For instance, if a virus interacts with a cell surface receptor at the threefold axis, then you know this interaction occurs at one of the faces of the icosahedron. A protein protruding from the capsid at the fivefold axis will be found at one of the vertices (tips) of the icosahedron.

The structural unit can be repeated over and over again to form a larger icosahedron side. The number of structural units that creates each side is called the triangulation number (T), because the structural units form the triangle face of the icosahedron. In a T = 1 virus, only one structural unit forms each icosahedron face (Fig. 2.8) . In a T = 4 virus, four structural units form the face. Sometimes the structural unit overlaps from one face to another: in a T = 3 virus, three total structural units form the face, although this occurs as six halfunits (half of each structural unit forms part of an adjacent face). Similarly, the structural units of a T = 7 virus are also slightly skewed, compared to the triangle face. The geometry and math involved with icosahedral capsid structure can be complex, and only the very basics are described here. In any case, by increasing the number of identical structural units on each face, the icosahedron can become progressively larger without requiring additional novel proteins to be produced. Some viruses have triangulation numbers over 25, even! The proteins that compose the structural unit may form three dimensional structures known as capsomeres that are visible in an electron micrograph. In icosahedral viruses, capsomeres generally take the form of pentons (containing five units) or hexons (containing six units) that form a visible pattern on the surface of the icosahedron (See Fig. 13.11 for an example). Capsomeres are morphological units that arise from the interaction of the proteins within the repeated structural units.",

A few viruses, however, have a complex architecture that does not strictly conform to a simple helical or icosahedral shape. Poxviruses, geminiviruses, and many bacteriophages are examples of viruses with complex structure (Fig. 2.10) . Poxviruses, including the viruses that cause smallpox or cowpox, are large oval or brick-shaped particles 200-400 nm long. Inside the complex virion, a dumbbell-shaped core encloses the viral DNA and is surrounded by two \"lateral bodies,\" the function of which is currently unknown. The geminiviruses also exhibit complex structure. As their name suggests, these plantinfecting viruses are composed of two icosahedral heads joined together. Bacteriophages, also known as bacterial viruses or prokaryotic viruses, are viruses that infect and replicate within bacteria. Many bacteriophages also have complex structure, such as bacteriophage P2, which has an icosahedral head, containing the nucleic acid, attached to a cylindrical tail sheath that facilitates binding of the bacteriophage to the bacterial cell.

            "text": "The classification of viruses is useful for many reasons. It allows scientists to contrast viruses and to reveal information on newly discovered viruses by comparing them to similar viruses. It also allows scientists to study the origin of viruses and how they have evolved over time. The classification of viruses is not simple, however-there are currently over 2800 different viral species with very different properties! One classification scheme was developed in the 1970s by Nobel laureate David Baltimore. The Baltimore classification system categorizes viruses based on the type of nucleic acid genome and replication strategy of the virus. The system also breaks down single-stranded RNA viruses into those that are positive strand (+) and negative strand (\u2212). As will be further discussed in the next chapter, positive-strand (also positive-sense or plus-strand) RNA is able to be immediately translated into proteins; as such, messenger RNA (mRNA) in the cell is positive strand. Negative-strand (also negative-sense or minusstrand) RNA is not translatable into proteins; it first has to be transcribed into positive-strand RNA. Baltimore also took into account viruses that are able to reverse transcribe, or create DNA from an RNA template, which is something that cells are not capable of doing. Together, the seven classes are There are a variety of ways by which viruses could be classified, however, including virion size, capsid structure, type of nucleic acid, physical properties, host species, or disease caused. Because of this formidable challenge, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) was formed and has been the sole body charged with classifying viruses since 1966. Taxonomy is the science of categorizing and assigning names (nomenclature) to organisms based on similar characteristics, and the ICTV utilizes the same taxonomical hierarchy that is used to classify living things. It is important to note that viruses, since they are not alive, belong to a completely separate system that does not fall under the tree of life. Whereas a living organism is classified using domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species taxa (singular: taxon), or categories, viruses are only classified using order, family, genus, and species (Table 2 .1).",

Other virion properties are also taken into account, including virion size, capsid shape, and whether or not an envelope is present. The taxa of viruses that infect vertebrates are shown in Fig. 2 .11; notice that some families are not yet classified into orders (refer to Table 2 .1 for a refresher on how to distinguish the taxa by their suffixes).

Virus names should also not include any person's name (although historically this was how a few viruses were named), and selected names should be easy to use and meaningful.When directly referring to a viral order, family, genus, or species the virus name should be written in italics with the first letter capitalized. When not referring specifically to viral classification, however, capitalization and italics are not required unless a proper name is encountered. For instance, \"Some members of the Arenaviridae family can cause severe disease, including lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and Lassa virus, which is named after the town in Nigeria where the first case occurred.\" The chart below gives some examples of where virus named originated(Table 2.3).",
