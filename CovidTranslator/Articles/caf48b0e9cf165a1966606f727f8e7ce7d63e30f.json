            "text": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) and its subdiscipline, invertebrate-derived DNA (iDNA) have been used to survey biodiversity non-invasively [1, 2] . Water is ubiquitous in most ecosystems, and, among invertebrates, terrestrial haematophagous leeches are abundant and can be easily collected in many tropical rainforests [3, 4] . Such non-invasive nucleic acid sources can mitigate difficulties of obtaining wildlife samples, particularly in remote areas or for rare species. Recently, eDNA/iDNA sources have been applied to monitoring specific wildlife pathogens [5, 6] . However, previous studies have focused on known pathogens, whereas most wildlife pathogens are uncharacterized and unknown. Non-invasive approaches to monitoring known and novel pathogens may be of particular benefit in ecosystems prone to viral emergence, many of which occur in areas where invasive sampling is challenging, such as tropical rainforests. Here, we show that both eDNA from natural waterholes, and iDNA from terrestrial haematophagous leeches, can be used to detect unknown viruses circulating in mammalian hosts (Figure 1 ). Using a curated set of RNA oligonucleotides based on the ViroChip microarray assay [7] as baits in a hybridization capture system, multiple mammalian RNA and DNA viruses were detected from both eDNA and iDNA samples. Congruence was found between host DNA assignment and viruses identified in leeches, and between animals observed visiting the waterholes and the viruses detected. Our results demonstrate that eDNA/iDNA samples may represent an effective non-invasive resource for studying wildlife viral diversity. Several of the detected viruses were novel, highlighting the potential of eDNA/iDNA for epidemiological analysis of emerging viruses prior to their emergence.",

Viruses were identified in 40 of the 68 leech pools analysed (59%) ( Fig. 2 ; Suppl. Tab. 1). In 18 of these (45%), two to three viruses were identified. Sequence data from six vertebrate-infecting viral families were detected, including the Anelloviridae, Circoviridae, Coronaviridae, Parvoviridae, Retroviridae and Rhabdoviridae. The most common viral group detected was Rhabdoviridae which was found in 37% of samples (25 samples out of 68), followed by Coronaviridae which was identified in 24% of samples (16 samples Fig. 2 ). The other contigs clustered phylogenetically, suggesting they represent two new species of a rhabdovirus related to lyssaviruses (Suppl. Fig. 2 ). Although in most cases one contig per sample was observed, in five samples (L4, L12, L23, L58, L68) two different viruses were found. Several viral regions for Rhabdoviridae were represented in the baits. However, most of the oligonucleotides were specific for the L gene which encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. All the recovered contigs mapped to the L gene (Suppl. Fig. 3A -C). The viral contig sequences were confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing for L55 and L58 (Suppl. Fig. 3D ).",

Mongolian sediment sample SM6 was positive for four contigs mapping to the protease (pro) gene of the Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) with 100% identity (Suppl. Fig.  11A ). JSRV from this sample was further confirmed by PCR (Suppl. Fig. 11A ). Mongolia sediment sample SM20 was positive for Equine adenovirus (100% identity) with a contig mapping to a region comprised between the pVI and hexon capsid genes (Suppl. Fig. 11B ). Given that multiple equine species are found in the Gobi Desert in Mongolia, it is likely that the water sources sampled may have been frequented by these species [10] . The sediment sample from Tanzania ST38 was positive for a Zetapapillomavirus related to the Equus caballus papillomavirus and Equus asinus papillomavirus (74% identity; E1-E2 genes) (Suppl. Fig. 11C ; Suppl. Fig. 12 ), consistent with the detection of Plains zebra's (Equus quagga) DNA from this water source [3] . Given that both captive and wild zebras have been known to contract bovine papillomaviruses [10, 11] it is likely that they are susceptible to different equine papillomaviruses.",

Sixty percent of emerging infectious diseases in humans are of zoonotic origin [13] . Wildlife trade and consumption of bushmeat, especially in Africa and Asia, have increasingly played a role in pathogen spillovers into human populations [14, 15] . Wildlife markets have recently facilitated the spillover of SARS-CoV-2 to humans [16] resulting in a pandemic [17] . The 2002-2003 SARS-CoV outbreak [18] , the Ebola outbreak in West Africa [19] and the global emergence of HIV [20] have all been linked to wildlife trade and bushmeat consumption. Early detection of novel infectious agents in wildlife represent a key factor to prevent their emergence. However, identification, surveillance and monitoring of emerging viruses using currently broadly applied approaches based on direct sampling of wildlife requires enormous investment in sampling, particularly for viruses that have low prevalence [21] . For example, 25,000 wild birds were sampled in Germany to detect avian influenza prevalence below 1% [22] . Similarly, sampling of over 8,157 animals in Poland was required to determine an 0.12% prevalence of African swine fever virus (ASF) [23] . Sampling under remote field conditions or in developing countries present additional challenges.",

The congruence of host DNA assignment for leeches and viral families identified suggests that bloodmeals are a useful resource for determining viral diversity. Similarly, the detection of primarily equine viruses from African and Mongolian waterholes, where intense wild equid visitation rates were directly observed, suggests eDNA viruses from this resource reflect host utilization of the water and do not derive from other environmental sources such as fomites distributed over long distances.",

The unknown viral diversity in the wild, and the potential degradation of viral nucleic acids in bloodmeals or in the environment, may affect detection by PCR resulting in high false negative rates. RNA oligonucleotide based hybridization capture overcomes such limitations because the short baits can capture divergent and degraded DNA. The comprehensive viral group representation in the RNA bait set also allows for the determination of both viral presence and viral diversity with a relatively simple workflow. The ability of oligonucleotides with substantial divergence from the target sequence to capture more distantly related sequences is particularly useful in virology since most viruses are uncharacterized in wildlife and many evolve rapidly.",

Several viral contigs were phylogenetically distinct from known viruses and may represent new genera. For example, the novel coronavirus identified in leech bloodmeals did not cluster with any of the known Coronaviridae clades. This finding highlights the ability of this method to detect unknown viruses. We could also associate the novel corona-and rhabdoviruses with mammal bloodmeals with limited evidence of a cervid association for both. Cervids are regularly sold as bushmeat in wildlife markets [25] and both recent coronavirus epidemics (SARS-CoV [18] and SARS-Cov-2 [16] ) spilled over from wildlife.

Large amounts of DNA can be extracted from bloodmeals, in particular when leeches are processed in bulk. We pooled up to 77 leeches and many of our leech bulk samples contained a diverse mix of mammalian DNA. A disadvantage of leeches is that they cannot be found in all environments: for example haematophagous terrestrial species are restricted to tropical rainforests of Asia, Madagascar and Australia [26] . In addition, leech feeding biases could influence diversity surveys [4, 27] . However, this disadvantage could be overcome in the future by employing additional invertebrates such mosquitoes [28] or carrion flies [29] . Waterholes are commonly found in almost all environments. In environments with seasonal water shortages, DNA from animals can become highly concentrated due to many animals utilizing rare water sources. The disadvantages are that the dilution factor of water, depending on water body size, can obscure rare DNA sequences and mixed host species sequences are generally the rule rather than the exception. Further experiments with field filtration and sample concentration such as methods used with pathogen detection in waste water may improve detection rates [30] .",

We included viruses that could have both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, such as vertebrate viruses with insect vectors. Exogenous retroviruses were represented but murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) were removed. MLVs sequences may interfere with the capture of other viruses, since MLVs can cross enrich endogenous retroviruses which can represent large portions of several vertebrate genomes and mask rarer viral sequences. Control oligonucleotides included in the Virochip, such as those from human genes, yeast intergenic sequences, and human papilloma virus sequences present in HeLa cells were also removed. Ninety-two 70-mer oligonucleotides covering (spaced end-to-end) the entire pol and gB genes of Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) were included as PCR screening of the water samples indicated they were positive for this virus (data not shown). The resulting 13,532 oligonucleotides were examined for repetitive elements, short repeats, and low complexity regions, which are problematic for probe design and capture, using RepeatMasker. Repetitive motifs were identified in 234 oligonucleotides, which were removed. The final targeted sequence capture panel consisted of 13,298 unique sequences which were synthesized (as a panel of biotinylated RNAs) at MYcroarray (Ann Arbor, USA).",

This left 81% of the original reads (Suppl. Tab. 1). Then, the filtered reads were searched by BLAST against a database generated from the capture bait sequences. The reads which matched with baits were then extracted and screened against the entire NCBI nucleotide database (nt) using BLASTn to find the best viral match. The filtered reads were mapped both to the corresponding bait sequence and the genome sequence of the best hit obtained by BLAST against the complete nt database, in order to generate a consensus sequence. This consensus sequence was again searched against the NCBI nt database using BLASTn to obtain a viral assignment. B) Leech reads were removed as in method A. In addition, rRNA reads were removed using SortMeRNA [38] , leaving 75% of the original reads (Suppl. Tab. 1). The filtered reads were de novo assembled using both Spades v3.11.1 [39] and Trinity v2.6.6 [40] assemblers. The obtained contigs from Spades and Trinity were pooled and clustered to remove duplicated or highly similar sequences using USEARCH v11.0.667 [41] with a 90% threshold identity value. The centroids were then subjected to sequential BLAST searches against the NCBI nucleotide database and NCBI RefSeq viral protein database using BLASTn and BLASTx, respectively. C) The adaptor and quality trimmed data were uploaded to Genome Detective [42] , a web base software that assembles viral genomes from NGS data. The software first groups reads into different buckets based on the proteins similarity to different viral hits. Genome detective then de novo assembles the reads of each bucket creating a longer consensus sequence that is then searched against the NCBI RefSeq viral database using BLASTx and BLASTn algorithms.

The DNAse-digested extracts were then purified using the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen). RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using iScript\u2122 Reverse Transcription Supermix (Bio Rad). Sediment and water samples that tested positive for EHV and JSRV were screened using a previously described pan-herpes PCR [47] and for JSRV [48] , respectively. The resulting amplicons were Sanger sequenced.",

In the upper panel the left photo shows a leech feeding on a frog in a rainforest of Vietnam (courtesy Andrew Tilker; Leibniz-IZW) and the right photo shows an African waterhole in Tanzania (courtesy Peter Seeber; Leibniz-IZW). The middle panel depicts the hybridization capture protocol. Briefly, Illumina libraries were produced from reverse transcribed RNA and DNA from leech bloodmeals or from waterhole surface water and sediments. Biotinylated viral RNA baits were hybridized to the libraries and non-target DNA was washed away. The remaining DNA was sequenced, reads assembled into contigs and mapped to reference viral genomes. These contigs were further analyzed to determine viral identity. Viral identity was paired with host identity determined either by mammalian metabarcoding of the leech samples, or by observation of waterhole usage.",

Rhabdoviridae contigs were genetically similar to three different viral genera (Suppl. Tab. 1). Five contigs were most similar (69-77%) to the Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSIV) (genus Vesiculovirus) as determined by BLAST searches. The limited similarity of the contigs to known rhabdoviruses suggest they may represent a new genus related to fish rhabodviruses (Perhabdovirus and Sprivirus) or Vesiculovirus (Suppl.",
