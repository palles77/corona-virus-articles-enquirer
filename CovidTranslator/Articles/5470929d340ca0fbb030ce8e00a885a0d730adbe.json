Before the inflection point, no model considered here could make a reliable prediction. We further notice the Logistic function steadily underestimate the final epidemic size, while the Gomertz's function makes an overestimation in all cases. Since the methods of sequential Bayesian and time-dependent reproduction number take the non-constant nature of the effective reproduction number with the progression of epidemics into consideration, we suggest to employ them especially in the late stage of an epidemic. The transition-like behavior of exponential growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the inflection point might be useful for constructing a more reliable forecast.",

Among them, empirical functions, methods based on statistical inference and dynamical models (difference equations, ODEs and PDEs) are three major routines (see Fig. 1 ). Empirical functions, especially those with explicit forms, are most popular ones. They are simple, easily understandable, fast implemented and analyzable. So many merits lay down the unreplaceable role of empirical functions in this field. The statistical inference methods are also highly welcomed, especially in the presence of a large amount of first-hand data. The basic goal of most statistical methods in epidemics is to estimate the basic/effective reproduction number, which serves as a key quantity to evaluate the future trends of an infectious disease. In dynamical models, the basic/effective reproduction number is transformed into reaction coefficients. Based on compartment assumptions on populations involved in epidemics, such as susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined, hospitalized, recovered and death, classical SI, SIR, SEIR and other generalized models show a great ability to correctly reproduce the basic features of the spreading process of an infectious disease, to reveal the hidden dynamics, like the numbers of exposed cases and asymptomatic carriers which are hard to be learnt from usual epidemiology investigation, to forecast the future trends of epidemics, as well to evaluate the influence of diverse control policies and actions against the spreading of infectious diseases in quantity.",

The latter inherits the merit of Logistic function by slightly underestimate the true epidemic size. It is further observed that the estimated basic reproduction number R 0 by the exponential growth method exhibits a transition from overestimation to underestimation with respect to the inflection point, which is in accordance with the S-shaped curve for the total infected populations.

Hill's and Richards' functions do not have such a consistency. Since the sequential Bayesian and time-dependent reproduction number methods take the non-constant nature of the effective reproduction number with the progression of epidemics into consideration, we think they are more accurate than the exponential growth and maximum likelihood methods especially in the late stage of an epidemic. The transition of exponential growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the inflection point could be quite useful for constructing a more reliable forecast. Towards the dynamic models based on ODEs, it is observed that the SEIR-QD and SEIR-PO models generally show a better performance than the other three, highlighting the essential of a trade-off between model complexity and fitting accuracy. The success of the former two models could also be attributed to the inclusion of self-protection and quarantine during the progression of COVID-19 epidemics.",

The initial conditions and parameter regions may also affect the results significantly, though our qualitative conclusions will not be changed. Besides five simple ODE models, many other epidemic models inclduing PDEs, stochastic equations and timedelayed equations are not considered. In addition, further validations than seven cases are needed to explore the applicable regions of all the methods/models.",

By separately fitting various models to different training data set, their forecasting abilities are compared in quantity through RMSE, AICc and RB values based on the test data set. Then similar approaches are carried out for the COVID-19 epidemics during almost the same time period in other six different regions in China selected mainly according to their geographic location (see Fig. 2), including Heilongjiang province (northeast China), Tianjin (northern), Guangdong province (southern), Chongqing (southwest), Hunan province (central) and Xiaogan city in Hubei province (central, the city with the second largest reported infected populations). However, their data set are divided into two instead of four and only one comparison is made for each case for simplicity.Our main findings are summarized as follows:(1) The best model for epidemic forecast can be picked out based on AIC and RB. The best model (judged by RMSE of test data) can be easily picked out from each group based on the values of AICc and RB (depending only on the model and training data!). The lower the AICc value is, the better trade-off between model complexity and 7 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
