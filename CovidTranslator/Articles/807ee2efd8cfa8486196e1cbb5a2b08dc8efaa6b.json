In recent studies, it was reported that \"amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\" and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) can be treated by Luteolin. We have studied Luteolin for years and have found that transforming growth factor-(TGF-) of lung tissue, generally residing in animal's normal cells (including Lung Fibroblasts, LFb) and transformant, can be inhibited by Luteolin [1, 2] . However, the main histopathological characteristics of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) are diffuse alveolitis early, pathological proliferation of large numbers of LFb laterly and progressive accumulation of collagens, resulting in impaired lung function and respiratory failure. Thereby, inhibiting excess proliferation of LFb is a vital treatment means of pulmonary fibrosis. In this article, effects of luteolin on LFb proliferation were mainly discussed so as to provide new therapeutic approaches to pulmonary fibrosis.",

All cells were randomly divided into 6 groups each of which received DMEM serum-free medium to serum-starve to synchronize cell cycle stage. After incubation for 24 h, DMEM serum-free medium was removed from each well .The normal control group received again DMEM serum-free medium, the positive control group received DMEM serum-free medium and Prednisolone acetate. 4 Luteolin test groups (with LFb) received DMEM serum-free medium and Luteolin (4\u00d710 -4 , 4\u00d710 -5 , 4\u00d710 -6 , 4\u00d710 -7 mol\u00b7L -1 ). Every group, being incubated for 24 , 48, 72 h at 37 C in 5% CO 2 , at the corresponding time point ,was freeze-thawed repeatedly, disrupted, shaken well and centrifugated 4 000 r\u00b7min -1 for 15min using refrigerated centrifuge, removing supernatant fluid. SOD activity was determined using SOD kit according to the manufacturers' protocol. Then OD was recorded by the multi-scanning spectrophot wavelength at 55 3.6 Statistics All data were expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation ( x \u00b1 s). The statistical significance of differences was analyzed using Student's t-test with a significance level of P < 0.05 and P < 0.01. Fig. 1 showed the LFb stimulated by Luteolin for 48, 72 h at the concentrations of 4\u00d710 -5 , 4\u00d710 -6 , 4\u00d710 -4 mol\u00b7L -1 was Fusiform-like and actiniform or paliform arrangement with broader cells compartment. In test groups of Luteolin, LFb of which the number reduced obviously had no distinguished morphological difference compared with the normal control group. This result suggested that Luteolin at the concentration of 4\u00d710 -5 , 4\u00d710 -6 , 4\u00d710 -4 mol\u00b7L -1 could obviously inhibit LFb proliferation. Fig.2 showed that when Luteolin at 4\u00d710 -4 , 4\u00d710 -5 or 4\u00d710 -6 mol\u00b7L -1 , OD were obviously lower (P < 0.01) compared with normal control group and was dose-dependent. This result suggested that experimental concentration of Luteolin can inhibit LFb proliferation (Fig. 2 ). Table 1 provided further support that Luteolin can inhibit LFb proliferation. LFb proliferation was obviously inhibited (P <0. 01) by Luteolin at the concentration of 4\u00d710 -4 , 4\u00d710 -5 , 4\u00d710 -6 mol\u00b7L -1 at 48, 72 h compared with normal control group, and this effect was dose-dependent. Especially, 4\u00d710 -4 mol\u00b7L -1 with complete proliferation-inhibiting effect on LFb showed no notable difference (P > 0.05) compared with quiescent LFb made by incubation in defined serum-free medium. However, Luteolin, 4\u00d710 -7 mol\u00b7L -1 , showed no obvious effect on LFb proliferation compared with normal control group. The effect of prednisolone acetate on LFb proliferation had statistical difference (P < 0.05) compared with normal control group. At 24 h, except positive control group, there was no obvious difference between Luteolin groups and normal control group (Table 1) . Table 2 indicated that SOD activity of Prednisolone acetate and Luteolin groups at 48, 72 h had statistical significance (P < 0.01) compared with the normal control group. Luteolin at the concentration of 4\u00d710 -4 mol\u00b7L -1 at 48 h enhanced SOD activity by 59% relatively to the normal control group. At 24 h, except positive control group, there was no obvious difference between Luteolin groups and normal control group (table 2).",

Our experimental results showed that cytostatic effect of Luteolin on LFb was dose-dependent; therefore we concluded that Luteo-lin possibly had certain therapeutic effect on pulmonary fi-brosis. At 24 h, the effects of Luteolin on LFb proliferation had no statistical significance, so we concluded that the time when Luteolin produced inhibiting effect on LFb exceeded 24 h. In recent studies [11] , pulmonary fibrosis, correlating intimately to oxidative-stress reaction, was also treated with antioxidant. Our findings were reported here that in this culture system, SOD activity was enhanced by Luteolin, suggesting that the inhibiting effect of Luteolin on LFb was possibly related to antioxidative effect of Luteolin. Despite our findings, the precise mechanisms of Luteolin underlying the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis are still unknown.",

RESULTS: Luteolin at the concentration of 4\u00d710 , 4\u00d710 mol\u00b7L inhibited evidently the growth and proliferation of lung fibroblasts, and enhanced SOD activity. The density, interval and volume of lung fibroblasts became decrescent. The effects, dose-dependently, had obvious statistical significance compared with normal control group. CONCLUSION: Luteolin can inhibit the proliferation of the lung fibroblasts in rat.
