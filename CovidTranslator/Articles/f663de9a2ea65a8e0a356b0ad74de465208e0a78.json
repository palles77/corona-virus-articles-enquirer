Laboratory work with A(H5N1) viruses is necessary to further our understanding of these viruses and the risk they pose to public health, and to develop vaccines. While best practices for working with HPAI viruses protect individuals from exposure, including enhanced BSL3 practices, some risk of inadvertent exposure exists [11] [12] [13] Vaccination is the primary method of preventing seasonal influenza and an important tool to prevent pandemic influenza [14] . In recent years, substantial research has been conducted on A(H5N1) vaccines, resulting in the development of licensed vaccine products for use during future pandemics and for pandemic stockpiles [7] . In 2013, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) Working Group on Influenza Vaccines and Immunizations updated their general recommendations on A(H5N1) vaccines to include use before pandemics (i.e., inter-pandemic) and strongly recommended vaccination of laboratory personnel working with A (H5N1) viruses [7] . In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Division of Select Agents and Toxins made specific recommendations for vaccination with an A(H5N1) vaccine for all laboratory workers working with influenza viruses containing hemagglutinin from the influenza A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 lineage [13] . However, without a licensed, available vaccine for use during the inter-pandemic period, access to A(H5N1) vaccine among laboratory personnel in the United States has been limited to participation in clinical trials.",

There are currently doses of four A(H5N1) monovalent vaccines in the U.S. stockpile. The U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) licensed two of these for use in the United States during a pandemic [17] . FDA licensed Q-Pan H5N1 in 2013 for use in persons aged 18 years at increased risk of occupational exposure to influenza A(H5N1) virus. The vaccine contains antigen from the influenza A/Indonesia/05/2005 virus strain (Clade 2.1.3.2) and is intended to be administered with an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant, AS03. The vaccine was prepared under contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as part of the national pandemic preparedness initiative. The U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recently considered the use of a small amount (<3000 doses) of stockpiled Q-Pan H5N1 vaccine for persons with occupational exposure to HPAI virus (e.g., laboratory workers) during the inter-pandemic period [18] .",

We estimated the response rate by occupational category using the numbers provided by each PI. Analysis was limited to those respondents who reported working in the BSL-3E area where HPAI experiments occur (and therefore could have been exposed to live virus or virus particles) with sub-analyses limited to those who worked directly with A(H5N1) viruses. Given that laboratory personnel may have varying work schedules in the BSL-3E area depending on occupational category and work (e.g., concentrated intermittent vs. regularly scheduled weekly hours), we asked respondents to estimate percentages of their total work time spent on various types of work with HPAI or A(H5N1) (<10%, 10-25%, 26-50%, 51-75% or >75%). To calculate the average time spent on each type of work with HPAI viruses, we multiplied the lower (1% for <10%, 10% for 10-25%, 26% for 26-50%, 51% for 51-75%, and 76% for >75%) and upper range (9% for <10%, 25% for 10-25%, 50% for 26-50%, 75 for 51-75% and 100% for >75%) of time spent performing each type of activity by either 40 h per week (if the respondent indicated that they were full-time staff), or 20 h per week (for parttime staff/employees).

Q-Pan H5N1 was the first licensed influenza vaccine with adjuvant in the United States [26] . Adjuvants are used to increase the magnitude and breadth (e.g., production of cross-strain neutralizing antibodies) of the immune response to the vaccine, which is especially important for vaccines containing influenza strains for which little or no prior antibodies are present, such as novel influenza A viruses [27] [28] [29] . During the 2009 influenza pandemic, some AS03-adjuvanted monovalent influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines were associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy in children and adolescents in some countries [30, 31] , though it is unknown whether this was related to the antigen, the adjuvant, some genetic susceptibility, or a combination of these factors. The acceptable safety profile of Q-Pan H5N1 was demonstrated in several studies prior to licensure and is comparable with seasonal influenza vaccines, though larger sample sizes are needed to assess for rare adverse events such as narcolepsy [29, 32, 33] . Furthermore, the ASO3 adjuvant used in Q-Pan H5N1 has been shown to have a better immune response than the MF59 adjuvant when used in an A (H7N9) vaccine [34] .",

In addition, our survey results may not be generalizable to other occupations with potential occupational exposure to HPAI viruses (e.g., avian influenza outbreak responders). We also had difficulties assessing accurately the time spent working with HPAI or A(H5N1) viruses. Estimates were based on respondents' reported typical work schedules, which may vary in time spent in the BSL-3E area working with HPAI. Individuals who work more with HPAI or influenza A (H5N1) viruses may have been more likely to respond to the survey introducing response bias. Finally, the survey was designed to collect information relevant for vaccination policy in the United States and distributed to laboratories registered with the USDA, so the results may not be generalizable to the broader global community.",
