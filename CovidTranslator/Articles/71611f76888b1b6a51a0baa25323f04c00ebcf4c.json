            "text": "More than a decade ago, Dr. Joseph Goldstein called attention to the increasing dissociation between scientific advances and their translation into improved health with his pithy analysis of the biotechnology industry: \"1 new gene per day, 1 new company per week, 1 new drug per year.\" 1 Unfortunately, the gap continues to grow, with increasing concerns about whether the enormous increase in knowledge brought about by the sequencing of the human genome and other scientific advances are being matched by the translational effort. For example, a recent review by the Congressional Budget Office found that the dramatic increase in inflation-adjusted funding of biomedical research since 1970 by the pharmaceutical industry and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in addition to the influx of capital from the biotechnology industry, has had only a minor impact on the number of truly new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration each year. 2 The outlook for the immediate future does not appear to be much brighter, with declining numbers of new drugs being submitted for regulatory approval 3 and the investment community expressing grave concerns about the prospects for both the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. 4,5 It is not surprising, therefore, that there has been intense focus on how to successfully bridge the gap between scientific discovery and the development of new strategies to diagnose, treat, and prevent disease; this process is now commonly called translational research.",

            "text": "Because the essence of one branch of translational research involves the integration of basic science and clinical medicine, there has been much focus on the importance of physician scientists, whose training provides them with an understanding of both disciplines. 1,6-10 The other branch of translational research, insuring that medical interventions of proven worth are applied correctly and consistently in clinical practice and in the community, is equally important and require the integration of clinical medicine with other disciplines. While this latter integration is also challenging, I will confine my comments to the interface between science and clinical medicine because my own career has been focused in this area. There has also been general recognition of the importance of shifting the translational effort from individuals to teams because multidisciplinary skills are required. 10 The NIH has responded to the challenge by crafting new training and grant awards and developing a loan repayment program; this has culminated in the creation of the Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program, whose goal is to transform academic institutions and reengineer the clinical research enterprise (http://www.ctsaweb.org). It emphasizes the training of new investigators and the creation of optimal institutional environments for the conduct of translational research. Ultimately, NIH plans to fund 60 CTSAs, creating both local centers of excellence and a consortium to develop national standards. Metrics are being developed to assess the success of the CTSA program over the next several years, but it will require a much longer period of time to truly judge its ultimate impact, and there already is concern about whether it has sufficient resources to achieve its goals. Thus, this is a propitious time for us to analyze the unique features of translational research, searching for insights that can help guide the research and training efforts in CTSAs and more broadly throughout the academic health center community.",

            "text": "Translational research differs from scientific discovery in both its goals and processes. Thus, scientific discovery starts with the current conceptual model and systematically tests its validity by assessing whether predictions based on the model are borne out by direct experiments. As long as the experiments are designed and conducted properly, new knowledge is obtained; the data either support the current model or demonstrate that it needs to be modified or discarded. Regardless of the result, the goal of adding to the store of human knowledge is achieved. In contrast, translational research springs from the motivation to improve human health; it starts with the articulation of a health need and then involves searching the available body of scientific knowledge to identify discoveries that can be harnessed to address the need. A bidirectional process between bench and bedside then ensues to develop and refine the idea and convert it into a new drug, diagnostic or therapeutic device, or preventive strategy, ultimately resulting in a change in medical practice, commonly requiring regulatory approval. The final goal is not just new knowledge but better health. Because there is always great uncertainty about the impact of any intervention in humans, especially side effects that cannot be predicted from in vitro studies or animal models, and because it is extremely challenging to design experiments to unequivocally assess safety and efficacy, the likelihood of success is unfortunately small. For example, even among drugs that survive the increasingly rigorous preclinical phase of development, only between 10% and 20% go on to achieve regulatory approval. 3 Despite these daunting odds, the quest is still worth the effort because the potential to improve human health may be enormous, and even failed attempts can provide valuable information for the next attempt. Thus, ideally the translational scientist tries to design experiments that have both a basic science hypothesis and a translational hypothesis because if as expected, the translational component fails, the additional basic science knowledge will improve the likelihood that the next translational attempt will be successful.",

Thus, training programs in this area of translational research, sometimes called T-1 translational research, should be organized to teach these skills through both experiential and didactic methods. There are many parallels to translational research focused on the interface between clinical medicine and the community, which is sometimes called T-2 translational research, but for this discipline, the \"assay\" is likely to be population-based rather than molecular.",

By focusing on a specific goal, one can judge its potential impact on improving health versus the effort and resources that will likely be needed to achieve the goal. In my own career, I have built on the knowledge gained from decades of work by others demonstrating a role for platelets in the pathophysiology of acute coronary syndromes and the emerging knowledge of the molecular basis of platelet physiology to construct the hypothesis that blockade of platelet \u03b1IIb\u03b23 receptors inhibiting platelet aggression by agents that would improve the therapy of ischemic cardiovascular disease in patients having, or at risk of having, platelet-mediated thrombosis. 11",

            "text": "Assay development requires the sophisticated integration of both scientific and medical knowledge because the assay needs to be both robust and biologically meaningful. Assay design is a crucial component of translational research because it allows one to assess the impact of different interventions in search of ones that provide mechanistic insights and pave the way for improved diagnosis, therapy, or prevention. Practical considerations, such as cost, time required to perform, and complexity, are important, especially if the assay is going to be used to screen large numbers of agents (eg, when one is trying to identify monoclonal antibodies or compounds from large libraries). The endpoint must be easy to interpret, and the result with both positive and negative controls must be highly reproducible. Most importantly, despite the simplification required to achieve the aforementioned goals, the assay must be medically and biologically meaningful, by which I mean that if the agent achieves the desired effect in the assay, there is a high likelihood that it will achieve the desired biological or medical effect when administered to an intact animal or human. In my own research, I developed an assay to measure the ability of the platelet \u03b1IIb\u03b23 receptor to bind fibrinogen by coating small beads with fibrinogen and then macroscopically determining the ability of platelets to agglutinate the beads by binding to the fibrinogen. 12 This permitted us to screen many hundreds of monoclonal antibodies while searching for an antibody that could block the binding of fibrinogen to the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 receptor on platelets. 13 One of the antibodies identified with this assay (10E5) was used for the prenatal diagnosis of inherited disorders of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 receptor 14 (Glanzmann thrombasthenia), and another (7E3) 15 was later modified in collaboration with scientists at Centocor to become the drug abciximab. 11,16 Subsequent modifications of antiplatelet this same assay have been used to both screen libraries of organic molecules to identify new compounds for potential drug development 17 and develop, in collaboration with the scientists at Accumetrics, a series of point-of-care assays to monitor antiplatelet therapy in clinical settings. 18, 19 To successfully complete a translational project, it is necessary to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the selected intervention in one or more rigorous clinical trials. Thus, the translational scientist requires a knowledge of the steps involved in preclinical development (medicinal chemistry, toxicology, pharmacology, and manufacturing) as well as an understanding of how to design and analyze early phase human studies. In addition, the investigator must have a firm understanding of the bioethical and biostatistical principles that are required to design a pivotal study to establish safety and efficacy. Most importantly, the translational scientist needs to understand the regulatory process and, in particular, the criteria for identifying an endpoint for the study that would justify approval for human use. Intimately connected is a requirement for insight into the practical considerations at the interface between academia and the private sector, including how the study endpoint and number of subjects needed to study will affect the length of time required to complete the study and the study's cost. It also requires an appreciation of the goals of the clinical investigators who will recruit the participants and conduct the study and an understanding of both their eagerness to advance the therapy of the diseases that they treat and their concerns about deviating from current, accepted practice. In my own career, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to learn from, and work with, outstanding scientists at Centocor and superb cardiology groups led by Dr. Chip Gold, Dr. Eric Topol, Dr. Rob Califf, Dr. Elliot Antman, and Dr. Eugene Braunwald, who provided me with an in-depth understanding of these vital issues. 11,20-23 I recognize that many academic leaders may believe that it is unreasonable to expect that an academic translational scientist or team will have all of the knowledge discussed here before embarking on a project. However, I think that the failure to have at least a conceptual understanding of the entire process can result in mistaken priority setting, inappropriate commitment of resources, and investigator frustration and dropout as predictably unrealistic expectations meet the harsh realities. Thus, formal opportunities to learn about how the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries develop drugs and devices should be incorporated into all translational training programs.",

Thus, the exigencies of having to provide medical care to a sick patient in an emergency or when there is insufficient time for a comprehensive evaluation, require that the physician accept uncertainty. In fact, some medical training is specifically designed to provide a preorganized routine to evaluate problems and initiate emergency measures without prolonged thought so as to avoid potentially dangerous delays. Beyond the exigencies of time pressure, however, physicians come to accept that they will not have all of the information that they would like to make a decision. In contrast, basic science training emphasizes the importance of eliminating uncertainty, the dangers of coming to conclusions too rapidly, and the need to wait for compelling evidence from multiple experimental sources and multiple approaches before modifying existing paradigms.

In contrast, basic scientist training emphasizes that all scientific models undergo continuous modification and refinements, and sometimes they are radically overturned by new evidence. Thus, although it is crucial to study what the current authorities have written and to consider carefully the opinion of one's mentor, it is equally important to keep probing current models for inconsistencies or inadequacies.

Each day they face a minefield of potential errors, such as incomplete differential diagnoses, drug-drug interactions, diseasedisease interactions, and diet-drug interactions. Failure to identify any one of these and to react accordingly may result in a patient suffering permanent damage or even death. That is why they are taught to build systems of care that will identify errors at a point where they can still be corrected and thus prevent the error from causing harm to a patient. In contrast, basic scientists learn that no matter how carefully they have analyzed the literature and their own experiments, many of their hypotheses will not be borne out by their experiments. In addition, some of their most novel experiments may lack an important control the first time that they are performed because the need for that particular control may only become apparent after the preliminary data are analyzed. Thus, the iterative nature of scientific discovery and the relative ease of repeating most experiments make error less threatening. Moreover, because so many scientific discoveries derive from paradoxical findings and serendipitous observations, selfconfident scientists publicly present their \"errors\" as the starting point for developing new theories.",

Although there have been a number of calls to develop an oath for basic scientists, 26-28 this idea has not met with widespread acceptance, most likely because scientists are concerned about imposing boundaries that may limit the intellectual freedom required for scientific inquiry. Basic scientists commonly point to the self-righting nature of science because truthfulness, the reproducibility of findings among different laboratories, and the need for internal consistency are central elements in the scientific process.

The K12 program, which is now the centerpiece of the training component in CTSAs, is an excellent addition to the K series, providing focused exposure to the elements of translational research. Unfortunately, however, even at its maximum length of 5 years, it is unlikely to provide sufficient time to reach scientific independence. The most recent statistics from the NIH indicate that MD investigators obtain their first R01 grant, on average, at the age of 43 to 44, 10,29 which is approximately 14 years after most physicians have completed their subspecialty training. Combining a K12 mentored experience of 3 years with either a K08 or K23 mentored grant of 5 years would provide a continuous period of 8 years of mentoring, which is probably the minimum necessary to absorb the knowledge required to compete successfully for an R01. A mentored experience of up to 8 years' duration is especially important if one wishes to attract late bloomers, those physicians who have not had intense exposure to basic science early in their careers but who decide on an investigative career during their clinical training. These individuals bring both their advanced knowledge of the state of art of medical care, and thus the ability to articulate a health need, and an intense commitment that reflects their willingness to make the additional personal and financial sacrifices necessary to develop a career as a physician scientist. Because a physician scientist's research productivity almost always follows a logarithmic pattern early in his or her career, with a variably long nucleation process followed by a period of exponential growth, it is especially important that the mentored training programs be of sufficient length to reach the period of high output.

Moreover, because they will be expected to compete for R01 grants with PhD and MD-PhD scientists, who commonly have had a total of approximately 8 to 11 years of mentored predoctoral and postdoctoral research experience, it is unrealistic to expect MD physician scientists to compete successfully unless they have mentored training of similar duration. It is important, therefore, to develop mechanisms of support that provide a sense of stability of long-term training funding, from the NIH and/or an academic institution, contingent, of course, on a demonstration of suitable scientific progress.",

Thus, expectations about the rate of dropouts from translational research training programs need to be realistic, lest inappropriate pressures and guilt distort the mentor-trainee-program-sponsor relationship.",

Such a program would avoid the irrevocable loss of talented young physician scientists from the translational research pool due to their failure to attain independent funding in an arbitrary time frame. This is especially important during the current period when NIH grants are exceedingly competitive. It would also facilitate the creation of stable multidisciplinary teams with enthusiastic and highly motivated junior scientists fresh from outstanding mentored training and eager to make scientific contributions while they continue their growth as physician scientists.",

Select in-depth examples should be presented to the students of how great basic scientists develop hypotheses, design experiments, develop methods needed to control variables, and struggle to extract the proper interpretation of the results. Parallels should be drawn to the methods by which master clinicians establish diagnoses. If students consider clinical observation an inadequate tool for serious scientific contributions, they should be reminded that Darwin developed the theory of evolution, which overturned all biological conventional wisdom, using only a magnifying glass as his primary scientific instrument and that within the last 35 years, clinicians have played a vital role in the early recognition of infections caused by Legionella, human immunodeficiency virus, West Nile virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome.

Effective leadership involves sensitizing the members of the team to the differences in perspective, training, and frames of reference of individual members so as to develop a climate of mutual respect and trust. It also requires the leader to ensure effective communication. For example, scientific knowledge and assumptions that are common knowledge to some members of the team but are not known by others need to be explicitly defined, and discipline-specific scientific jargon should be reduced or eliminated. It also requires building consensus on shared values and goals and the most effective paths to achieve the goals. Inviting feedback from all members of the team in group meetings and on an individual basis ensures that frustrations and misperceptions are aired so that they can be addressed directly. Although extra time and effort are required to build such teams, there are intrinsic benefits in having individuals who are new to one's discipline ask \"na\u00efve\" questions because they often trigger serious contemplation of assumptions that rest on less than solid evidence. Similarly, presenting one's most recent data to individuals who are not knowledgeable about the field requires precise thought and framing the issues with creative metaphors.",

For example, creating financial incentives for achieving threshold levels of salary support from clinical reimbursements or from grant support may inadvertently discriminate against those who obtain partial support from each.

Updates from the NIH, the Food and Drug Administration, philanthropic foundations and the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, and clinical research organization industries would also be valuable, as would a plenary session composed of outstanding examples of clinical and translational science across the entire T1-T2 spectrum. Such a society could also sponsor a journal and provide information to the public and governmental officials on topics important for the continued success of clinical and translational science.

            "text": "In his famous 1959 Rede Lecture at Cambridge, 32 C. P. Snow observed that the intellectual life of Western society was being split into 2 polar groups-literary intellectuals and scientistsreflecting 2 cultures separated by a gulf of mutual incomprehension and lack of understanding. He underscored the serious consequences of the failure of these 2 cultures to communicate for developing sound public policy and for addressing the most important international issues of the time, especially the divide between rich and poor nations. He advocated for changes in the educational system to address the crisis, although he recognized that there was unlikely to be a simple or easy solution. The physician scientist stands astride 2 much more closely connected cultures but ones that are distinct enough to require a real effort to bridge. Thus, understanding the unique cultural values of basic science and clinical medicine provides useful insights that can be converted into optimal strategies to train and support translational physician scientists. Bold action is clearly needed, however, because the stakes are very high. The drumbeat of human demographics, the unsustainable rate of growth in the cost of healthcare, and the social justice imperative of alleviating suffering from disease worldwide all cry out for us to bring creativity, good will, passion, and resources to the quest.",
