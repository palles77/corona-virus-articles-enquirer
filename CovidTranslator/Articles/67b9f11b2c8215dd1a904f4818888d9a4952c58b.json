However, the effect of oxymatrine on acute lung injury (ALI) has not been known yet. In this study, the effect of oxymatrine on ALI was investigated using an oleic acid-induced ALI mouse model. Morphological findings showed that the oleic acid group demonstrated a marked lung injury represented by prominent atelectasis, intraalveolar and interstitial patchy hemorrhage, edema, thickened alveolar septum, formation of hyaline membranes and the existence of inflammatory cells in alveolar spaces. While in the oxymatrine/dexamethasone group, these changes were less severe and in the vicinity of the control group. Furthermore, pretreatment with oxymatrine significantly alleviated oleic acid-induced lung injury accompanied by reduction of lung index and wet-to-dry weight ratio, decreases in serum TNF-\u2423 level and inhibition of phosphorylated p38 MAPK. These findings suggest that oxymatrine has a beneficial effect on acute lung injury induced by oleic acid in mice and may inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-\u2423, by means of the inhibition of p38 MAPK.",

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by increased capillary endothelial permeability that leads to segmental accumulation of high protein content in interstitial edema. Fibrin and platelet plugs occlude the microvasculature of the lung and neutrophil sequestration and activation in the interstitium leads to further segmental alveolar damage and flooding. These processes result in decreased pulmonary compliance, compromised gas exchange and extensive intra-pulmonary shunting with concomitant ventilation-perfusion mismatching. At present, ARDS is often classified as a continuum of injury ranging from the milder form 'acute lung injury (ALI)' to the more severe form 'ARDS' (Christopher et al., 1999) .",

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a novel global infectious disease induced by a virus from the family Coronaviridae. Clinical investigation shows that pathological changes in SARS patients are similar to those of acute lung injury, as revealed by alveolar cell collapse, severe exudation, acute inflammatory reaction and hyaline membrane formation (Zhong, 2003; Du et al., 2004) . Currently, no corrective therapy is available for the 0378 It is generally accepted that the development of MODS follows the gradual route of ALI-ARDS-MODS. During this pathway, the lung behaves as a central organ and is the first target subject to injury. Because pulmonary dysfunction may lead to severe hypoxemia and further other multiple organ dysfunction or failure, the treatment of the above mentioned diseases should concentrate on the development of ALI and take measures as soon as possible . The research and development of anti-SARS drugs should also comply with this law. Potential new therapeutic strategies for SARS have been shown to include a wide search for drugs, which is conducive to reduction of lung injury and management of symptoms (Zhong, 2003; Du et al., 2004) .",

Although the detailed mechanism is still unknown, the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) has been paid special attention. p38 MAPK is a cytokinesuppressive anti-inflammatory drug target first discovered by Lee et al. (1994) . Most reports demonstrate that p38 MAPK is responsible for regulating inflammatory responses (Nick et al., 2000 (Nick et al., , 2002 Fang et al., 2002) . On the other hand, Arcaroli et al. (2001) reported that p38 did not have a central role in the development of ALI after either hemorrhage or endotoxemia. Thus, the role of p38 MAPK in the development of ALI is still uncertained. As a result, p38 MAPK has not been proposed as a valid target for clinical management of ALI/ARDS. In order to examine the role of p38 MAPK in ALI, we then analyzed the expression of p38 MAPK and evaluated the effects of oxymatrine. The expression of p38 MAP kinase was shown using Western blotting analysis. Results showed that phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase was augmented in the oleic acid group compared with the control group, whereas expression of phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase was attenuated in the oxymatrine group compared with the oleic acid group in a concentration-dependent manner. This suggested that the administration of oxymatrine before ALI markedly attenuate the activation of p38 MAP kinase during lung injury. It has been reported that TNF-\u2423 is augmented via activation of the p38 MAP kinase-related intracellular signal pathway (Johnson et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1994) . Oxymatrine markedly attenuated the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and disturbed the mechanism for the production of TNF-\u2423, thus resulting in the lower serum TNF-\u2423 level.",

The NF-B pathway is also reported to be involved in the process of ALI. Together with the three types of MAPK, NF-B may create a network to regulate inflammatory responses in ALI. In this study, we only studied the effect of oxymatrine on p38 MAPK. Further study is needed to elucidate whether oxymatrine has modulative effects on other pathways.",
