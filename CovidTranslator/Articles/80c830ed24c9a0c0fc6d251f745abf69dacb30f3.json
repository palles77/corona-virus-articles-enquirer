The underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that in the toxic demyelination cuprizone model, oligodendroglial cell death and downregulation of myelin genes start days after initiation of the cuprizone diet and weeks before demyelination is obvious. In earlybut not in laterstages, dying oligodendrocytes express activated caspase 3, suggesting a switch from classical apoptotic pathways to caspase 3-independent mechanisms during the course of the cuprizone diet. The expression level of FAS in the corpus callosum, a cell death receptor crucial for oligodendroglial cell death in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), correlates with the expression of activated caspase 3 in oligodendrocytes. However, mice lacking FAS in oligodendrocytes are not protected against cuprizone-induced oligodendroglial cell death, showing that FAS is dispensable for oligodendroglial cell death in the cuprizone model.",

            "text": "Oligodendroglial dysfunction and cell death are features of numerous human CNS diseases, such as demyelinating diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis), stroke, spinal cord injury or neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. multiple system atrophy) (Barnett and Prineas, 2004; Lucchinetti et al., 2000; Wenning et al., 2008) . However, although oligodendroglial cell death is a common feature in many CNS diseases, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most frequent human demyelinating disorder with heterogeneous clinical and pathological findings. Histopathologically, two different categories can be distinguished: One pattern is characterized by immune-mediated demyelination while the other is characterized by a primary oligodendrogliopathy. The morphology of dying oligodendrocytes in MS lesions shows some characteristics of apoptosis, e.g. condensed and fragmented nuclei; additionally, the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, such as bcl-2, p53 and FAS, has been described in the oligodendrocytes in MS lesions (Dowling et al., 1996; Kuhlmann et al., 1999; Wosik et al., 2003) . The FAS signalling cascade has been shown to be involved in oligodendroglial cell death in vitro and in vivo. In vitro incubation of human oligodendroglial cell lines with FAS ligand leads to apoptotic cell death (Austin and Fehlings, 2008; Li et al., 2002) . Challenging primary human oligodendrocytes with IFN\u03b3 or increased levels of p53 renders oligodendrocytes susceptible to FAS-mediated cell death (Pouly et al., 2000; Wosik et al., 2003) . Additionally, FAS has been shown to be upregulated in oligodendrocytes in MS lesions as well as in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS (Bonetti et al., 1993; Bonetti and Raine, 1997; Dowling et al., 1996; Raine et al., 1998; Sabelko-Downes et al., 1999) . Mice lacking FAS especially in oligodendrocytes show limited oligodendroglial cell death and reduced clinical symptoms in EAE (Hovelmeyer et al., 2005) .",

While demyelination is most extensive 6 weeks after initiating the cuprizone diet, oligodendroglial cell death starts earlier.

Similar numbers of dying oligoden- Fig. 1 . On day 6 after the start of the cuprizone diet, numerous cells with the typical morphological characteristics of apoptosis, such as round, condensed and fragmented nuclei were detected (a). On day 21, the dying cells displayed condensed nuclei, but they were rarely fragmented (b). Dying cells with apoptotic morphology (arrow) were also detected in the cortex and identified as oligodendrocytes by immunohistochemistry for CNPase (brown) (c). To detect DNA double strand breaks, TUNEL was performed. Some of the TUNEL-positive cells (black) were also positive for CNP (arrow). TUNEL-negative CNP-positive oligodendrocytes are indicated by arrow heads (d). To determine whether the cells underwent apoptosis, immunohistochemistry for activated caspase 3 was performed (e and f). On day 6 (e), almost all oligodendrocytes with condensed and fragmented nuclei expressed activated caspase 3, whereas after 21 days of cuprizone diet all dying oligodendrocytes were negative for activated caspase 3 (f). The expression of activated caspase 3 was confined to apoptotic oligodendrocytes as double immunohistochemistry for CNPase (green) and activated caspase 3 (red) demonstrated (g-j). The CNPase-positive oligodendrocyte indicated by the arrow head contains a fragmented and condensed nucleus and expresses activated caspase 3 in the cytoplasm. Arrows indicate non-apoptotic oligodendrocytes. Scale bars in a-f, 20 \u03bcm; scale bars in g-j, 10 \u03bcm. drocytes were found compared to days 6 and 10 (117 \u00b1 61 cells/mm 2 ).

In additional studies, apoptotic oligodendrocytes were present 2 days after the start of the cuprizone diet (data not shown). Not only in the corpus callosum but also in the cortex apoptotic cells were observed (Fig. 1c) , although in somewhat reduced numbers on days 6 and 10 compared to the corpus callosum. Immunohistochemistry with CNPase confirmed that the apoptotic cells were oligodendrocytes (Fig. 1c) .

However, in later disease stages the percentage of activated caspase 3positive oligodendrocytes decreases gradually to the complete absence of caspase 3 on day 21. These findings are suggestive for a change from a caspase 3-dependent to a caspase 3-independent cell Fig. 5 . FAS-KO and FAS-wt mice were fed for up to 10 days with 0.2% cuprizone, controls received chow without cuprizone.

The dying oligodendrocytes still display some morphological characteristics of apoptosis, this makes it tempting to speculate that apoptotic-like cell death mechanisms might contribute to oligodendroglial cell death at later stages (for a review, see Boujrad et al., 2007) . This type of cell death is controlled by mitochondria, and one of the major effectors might be the apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Increased Ca 2+ levels and generation of oxygen species are triggers for release of AIF from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. It is conceivable that cuprizone, which has been described as damaging mitochondria, also directly or indirectly mediates the mitochondrial release of AIF (Maloff et al., 1978) . Downstream signalling cascades may involve poly(ADPribose) polymerase, calpains or EndoG (Moubarak et al., 2007; Niikura et al., 2007) . However, so far no direct evidence exists that indicates a contribution of this pathway to cuprizone-induced demyelination; further studies are required to reveal the exact mechanisms underlying caspase-independent cell death in later stages of the cuprizone diet.",

            "text": "The cuprizone model is a relatively artificial model and cannot be regarded as a prototypical paradigm mimicking oligodendroglial cell death in human demyelinating diseases. However, it provides insights in general cell death mechanisms that can be activated in oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, since the cuprizone model is frequently used to study remyelination, the mechanisms leading to demyelination and oligodendroglial cell death deserve deeper understanding. Little is known about potential pathways leading to the cleavage and activation of caspase 3 in the cuprizone model. Mice on the cuprizone diet lacking p53 or treated with the p53 inhibitor pifithrin-\u03b1 show reduced apoptosis and improved preservation of oligodendrocytes as well myelin, suggesting that p53 is involved in oligodendroglial cell death in this toxic demyelination model (Li et al., 2008) . Increased expression of p53 has been observed in MS lesions and leads in vitro to an increased susceptibility to FAS-or TRAIL-mediated oligodendroglial cell death (Wosik et al., 2003) . FAS has been shown to be upregulated in oligodendrocytes in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, in coronavirus-induced oligodendroglial cell death, in animal models of spinal cord injury and hypoxia-induced demyelination as well as in MS lesions and multiple systems atrophy (Casha et al., 2001; Gerstner et al., 2007; Hovelmeyer et al., 2005; Liu and Zhang, 2007) . In animal models of spinal cord trauma, the lack of FAS or neutralization of FAS ligand is associated with increased oligodendroglial survival (Casha et al., 2005; Demjen et al., 2004) . Mice lacking FAS, especially in oligodendrocytes, show improved clinical symptoms, reduced demyelination and oligodendroglial cell death compared to control animals in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Hovelmeyer et al., 2005) . In the cuprizone model, apoptotic oligodendrocytes express activated caspase 3, and this is associated with a significant increase of FAS mRNA in the corpus callosum. However, no differences in the amount of demyelination, oligodendroglial cell death, number of apoptotic cells or inflammatory response was observed, indicating that FAS is not necessary for oligodendroglial cell death in the cuprizone model. These data strongly suggest that toxin-induced cell death is mediated via FASindependent mechanisms, e.g. mitochondrial cell death mechanisms. These results are in contrast to the observed role of FAS for oligodendroglial cell death in EAE (Hovelmeyer et al., 2005 ). An obvious difference between EAE and the cuprizone model is the role of the immune system. Whereas EAE is an autoimmune-mediated disease in which T cells play a pivotal role, the immune response in the cuprizone model is limited to the activation of macrophages/ microglial cells and very low numbers of T cells. In contrast to EAE, the blood-brain barrier remains intact in the cuprizone model (Remington et al., 2007) . In EAE, therefore, the immune response may trigger oligodendroglial cell death via the FAS receptor, whereas in the cuprizone model cell death might be mediated via the mitochondrial cascade. In summary, we show that oligodendroglial cell death starts early after initiation of the cuprizone model and weeks before the loss of myelin is obvious by immunohistochemistry. Expression of activated caspase 3 is a prominent feature of dying oligodendrocytes during the early disease phase which is lost in later stages. Additionally, although FAS expression correlates with the expression of activated caspase 3, it is not necessary for oligodendroglial cell death. Further studies are required to identify the mechanisms leading to oligodendroglial cell death in early and late stages of the cuprizone model.",
