This innovative and general procedure, based on the representation of the molecular iso-electron density surface in terms of 2D Zernike polynomials, allows the rapid and quantitative assessment of the geometrical shape complementarity between interacting proteins, that was unfeasible with previous methods. We first tested the method with a large dataset of known protein complexes obtaining an overall area under the ROC curve of 0.69 in the blind recognition of binding sites and then applied it to investigate the features of the interaction between the Spike protein of SARS-Cov-2 and human cellular receptors. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 uses a dual strategy: its spike protein could also interact with sialic acid receptors of the cells in the upper airways, in addition to the known interaction with Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. * The authors contributed equally to the present work. \u2020 Corresponding author: edoardo.milanetti@uniroma1.it gious from the beginning of the incubation period, and that between the incubation period and the end of the infection each infected individual transmits the infection to about 3.77 other people [9] .",

Applying the Zernike expansion we compute -completely unsupervised -numerical descriptors that summarize the patch geometry and we use them to compute the structural similarity between any two patches. The Zernike descriptors are rotationally invariant, ensuring to the method an high efficiency and a low computational cost since it avoids the necessity of any preliminary structure orientation. Overall, these operation substantially reduces the search space dimensionality, thus allowing our method to be able to explore several more protein regions compered to previous methods.",

These viruses bind to cell surface components containing N-acetyl-9-Oacetylneuraminic acid and this interaction is essential for initiation of an infection [32] . In particular, we propose here a possible alternative mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 cellular infection, through spike protein interaction with sialic acid receptors of the upper airways, similarly to what has been shown for the MERS spike protein [33] . We indeed highlights that a surface region in the Nterminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike is very similar to the MERS spike sialic acid binding region, and present a compatible charge. These observations suggest that these two pockets potentially share a analogous function. This second infection mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 could explain its high diffusion speed.",

It is interesting to notice that the contact between spike and ACE2 receptor both for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 occurs in two separate interacting regions (see Fig. 2 ), meaning that we need to investigate the two interacting regions separately. When comparing the two raw distances, we found that ACE2-SARS-CoV distance is smaller than the ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 one, even if for both complexes the complementarity is much higher than the one would find in other random regions of the complexes (see Figure 2 ).

Emergency caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 human infection, which is spreading with an impressive rate, such that the World Health Organization officially declared it a pandemic. Indeed, the last few months have seen extensive studies about the virus-host interactions focusing in particular on the various stages of the cell internalization mechanism. Recent works found that, in analogy with the case of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses too its spike protein to bind to ACE2 receptors, mostly associated in the lower respiratory ways. Further experimental investigations highlighted a comparable receptor binding affinity between the novel coronavirus and the older SARS-CoV, even if the binding regions display a certain degree of variability [21] . The modest difference in binding affinity seems insufficient to explain the higher human-human transmission rate in respect to SARS-CoV and the overall sequence variability suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may have optimized in other directions, such as in acquiring the ability of binding to other receptors [19] .",

Testing the unsupervised method on a large dataset of protein-protein interactions, we proved its ability to correctly recognize the high shape complementarity occurring between interacting surfaces. Analizing the newly available experimental structures of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in complex with human ACE2, we found that the binding region presents indeed a comparable (slightly slower) shape complementarity with the analogous complex of SARS-CoV. Such a minimal difference enforces the hypothesis that the apparent higher fitness of SARS-CoV-2 should lie elsewhere. In particular, looking at other members of the large coronavirus family, one finds that many members developed the ability to bind to two distinct receptors, with one binding site in the C-terminal domain of the S-protein (like ACE2 for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) and the other situated in the N-terminal region, usually able to bind to sugar-like molecules. In particular, MERS-CoV has been found able to bind to sialic acid receptors both in camel, human and bat cells. Applying our method to the sialic acid binding region, which has been recently determined experimentally in MERS-CoV, we have found an exceptionally similar region in the cor-responding region of SARS-CoV-2 spike. We speculate that this region, similar in structure to the MERS-CoV one and absent in SARS-CoV (see Figure 4 ), could be able to mediate a low-affinity but high-avidity interaction with sialic acid. In conclusion, we propose that this dual cell entry mechanism can explain the high diffusion speed this virus exhibits and we strongly encourage a more accurate investigation of this observation.",

In principle, the region of interest can have an arbitrary shape, in this work we chose to use a spherical region having radius R s and one point of the surface as center (see Figure 1a ). Once the patch is selected, we fit a plane that passes though the points in \u03a3, and we reorient the patch in such a way to have the z-axis perpendicular to the plane and going through the center of the plane. Then given a point C on the z-axis we define the angle \u03b8 as the largest angle between the perpendicular axis and a secant connecting C to any point of the surface \u03a3. C is then set in order that \u03b8 = 45 \u2022 . r is the distance between C and a surface point. We then build a square grid, and we associate each pixel with the mean r of the points inside it. This 2D function can be expanded in the basis of the Zernike polynomials: the norm of the coefficients of this expansion constitute the Zernike invariant descriptors, which are invariant under rotation in the space. In the next section we provide a brief summary of the main features of the Zernike basis. There are several good reviews, like [45] that offer more detailed discussions.

Red dotted line represents the distance between the real ACE2 and S spike's patches. b) The same as a) but for the binding site of SARS-Cov-2 and the human ACE2 receptor. The real distances are in the 1st and 5th percentiles of the distributions for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 respectively.",
