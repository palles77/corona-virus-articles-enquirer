For example, the degree of heterogenetic protection resulting from in utero injection of a single type of organism, the fetal response to organisms other than E. coli and reovirus, or the effect of antigenically stimulating a prenatally vaccinated calf are but a few of the important questions.",

Injection site is where the fetus is closest to the abdominal wall as determined by ballottment, care being taken to avoid abomasal or duodenal areas. Following clipping of hair and scrubbing the skin with a surgical antiseptic, local anesthetic is infiltrated into subcutaneous tissue, abdominal muscles, and peritoneum at the proposed injection site. A 12 gauge hypodermic needle, 5 cm long, is inserted into the peritoneal cavity via a stab incision in the skin. This short needle serves as a cannula for passage of a 25 or 30 cm 16 gauge needle which is directed toward the uterus and gently pushed through the uterine wall and fetal membranes until the fetus is touched, but not pierced. Presence of the needle in the amniotic cavity is confirmed by aspirating amniotic fluid prior to the injection; however, on rare occasions fluid can not be aspirated. The volume of bacterial antigen injected is 2 to 3 ml containing approximately 2 \u00d7 101\u00b0 cells S Department of Microbiology and Public Health, G. R. Carter. per ml. Aseptic techniques are used throughout the vaccination procedure. With one assistant, the vaccination can be performed in 5 min.",

To kill the cells, .4% formalin was added, and the suspension was incubated in a shaking water bath (37 C) for 18 to 24 h. The formalin-killed cells were then washed twice with sterile saline and a cell count was obtained. The suspension was then diluted with sterile saline containing .002% thimerosal to a desired concentration, approximately 1.5 or 2 x 1010 ceUs/ml, stored at 4 C and used within 20 days.",

However, it appears feasible that such a procedure could provide protection against diseases for which there are inadequate or unsatisfactory immunization procedures after birth. For example, viral diseases such as bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) or infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) might be prevented by fetal vaccination. Postnatal vaccination for these diseases is not always effective and, if given at the wrong time, results in abortions and fetal aberrations. There are at least two viruses (reovirus, coronavirus) responsible for enteric disorders of the newborn calf. Although it may be possible to immunize the neonatal calf against these diseases, prenatal vaccination conceivably could provide the newborn with a more effective immunization, because protective antibodies would be present at birth.",
