            "text": "The use of antibodies to detect and identify infectious agents in tissue sections has proven to be a valuable adjunct in the pathologic evaluation of formalin-fixed tissues from any sites; however, it has probably been under utilized in placental diagnosis. Immunoperoxidase techniques, using the chromogens diaminobenzidine (DAB) or 3amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC), or an immunoalkaline-phosphatase system, often with the chromogen fast red, are the most common antibody-based reactions used. Immunoperoxidase staining has the advantage of producing good results in both fresh frozen and formalin-fixed tissue sections of placenta. However, alkaline phosphatase methods are not suitable for use in frozen placental tissue samples, due to the high level of endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity in this organ. Because immunohistochemistry is based upon an antigen-antibody reaction, there must be adequate preservation of the antigenic characteristics of the infectious agent to produce good results. Consequently, the possibility of false negative staining in tissue which has been overfixed in formalin or other deleterious fixatives, autolyzed, or otherwise mistreated should always be considered when the results of staining are correlated with the clinical information. (Table 1) and polyclonal antibodies to microbial pathogens are currently available commercially, with additional reagents for infectious agents continually being added. The most common infections that can be diagnosed using immunohistochemistry are cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Wolber and Lloyd, 1988; Robey et al., 1988) and herpex simplex virus (HSV) (Sauerberi et al., 1985) . In cases of CMV infection, antibodies to early CMV antigen may detect infected cells without demonstrable cytopathic effects, an advantage compared to in situ hybridization (Robey et al., 1988) . However, in situ hybridization often produces more intense staining than immunochemistry (Wolber and Lloyd, 1988) . Thus, in those cases in which diagnostic viral cytopathic effects in placental tissues cannot be readily discerned with routine hematoxylin and eosin staining, we prefer to demonstrate CMV and HSV by two complementary techniques -immunohistochemistry to identify viral antigen, and in situ nucleic acid hybridization (discussed below) to confirm the presence of viral nucleic acid.",

In cases of villitis, in which inflammatory cells are present in chorionic villi, antibodies to leukocyte surface antigens are used to characterize the cellular response. Using a panel of antibodies to leukocyte surface antigens, found that the predominant response in placentae with CMV-associated villitis was T lymphocytes, Hofbauer cells, and lgM-and IgG-secreting plasma cells. A significant finding in these placentae was the occurrence of CD45RO-positive T lymphocytes, a marker for activated and memory T cells, in gestations as early as 14 weeks. Hofbauer cells, the villus stromal macrophages of fetal origin, can also be functionally and quantitatively assessed in placental infections using antibodies to macrophage antigens (Figure 1 ). This technique has also been used to study the inflammatory response in placentae with villitis of unknown etiology (Labarrere et al., 1990) , who found that areas of villitis contained activated (HLA-Dr, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ reactive) macrophages, T lymphocytes of CD4 (helper) phenotype, and lack of B Cells. Identification and characterization of placental cells in the proliferation phase of the cell cycle using the monoclonal antibodies Ki-67 and PCNA (cyclin) has recently been used to study congenital viral infections (Schwartz et al., manuscript in submission) (Figure 2 ).",

Both direct and indirect tests can be used -direct fluorescence using an antibody tagged with the fluorochrome label, and indirect fluorescence using first an unlabeled microbe-specific primary antibody followed by a fluorochrome-tagged antibody to the primary antibody. Double-labeling p techniques are facilitated using fluorochrome-labeling due to the ease of two color discrimination by changing filters. However, immunofluroescent antibody studies of placental tissues have been infrequently used for diagnostic purposes. This may be due partly to the past limitations in using this technique in formalin-fixed tissues, and the requirement for a fluorescent microscope. The advent of inexpensive biotinylated antibodies for pathologic diagnosis has further decreased the popularity of immunofluorescent antibody methods in diagnosis. Immunofluorescence has the great advantage of rapid turnaround time, often a few hours after tissue sectioning. In our laboratories we prefer to use immunofluorescent antibody techniques to identify low numbers of microbial pathogens in formalin-fixed placental tissue. In particular, we have found this to be a highly sensitive method for tissue diagnosis of Treponema pallidum (Figure 3) , especially when compared with the silver-based Steiner staining used in most histology laboratories (Ito et al., 1992; Hunter, 1990; .",

It is a sensitive method for infectious disease diagnosis that can be rapidly performed in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections from a wide variety of tissues (Piper and Unger, 1989; . It is generally used for diagnositic purposes in combination with a biotin or digoxigenin labeling technique (Leary et al., 1983; Haase, 1986; Brigati et al., 1993) . In some research applications, the sensitivity of detection can be improved using a radioisotopic label such as 35S or 32p, with target nucleic acid detected by autoradiography (Singer et al., 1986) . In situ hybridization is especially valuable for demonstration of infections which cannot be readily cultivated in vitro. Many studies have compared the relative sensitivity of in situ nucleic acid hybridization versus immunohistochemistry for detecting infectious agents, with varying results. However, in some cases in situ hybridization appears less likely to produce false negative staining due to overfixation because of the greater resistance of nucleic acids to formalin compared to antigens. Thus, in situ nucleic acid hybridization may be the preferred technique in placental pathology in those cases where overfixation of tissue is difficult to control. In situ hybridization does have some disadvantages -the reagents are more costly, the tissue digestion is more severe, and the loss of cellular and nuclear structure is more apparent, than occurs using immunohistochemistry. The in situ hybridization detection of RNA (such as the human immunodeficiency virus) requires prompt handling of tissue due t ~ the lability of RNA (O'Leary and Wright, 1991) . The role of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in diagnostic placental pathology has usually been for the confirmation of infectious agents or viral cytopathic effects following examination of routinely stained sections. However, associates (1991, 1992) have recently used in situ DNA hybridization to demonstrate that herpes simplex infection of placenta-associated tissues can be found in the majority of pregnant women with concurrent or previous episodes of genital herpes. In these cases, no viral cytopathic effect can be identified in hematoxylin and eosinstained slides, and DNA hybridization is necessary to identify the infected decidualized cells of the decidua capsularis and decidua basalis. Thus, nucleic acid hybridization can often be useful for the detection of microbial agents even in the absence of detectable organisms with routine staining.",

            "text": "The polymerase chain reaction (PCR), first described in 1985 (Marx, 1988; Schochetman et al., 1988) , is a technique for the in vitro amplification of DNA from a variety of viruses and other infectious agents. The principle of this technique involved repeated cycles of heat denaturation of target DNA, followed by annealing of primers to their complementary strands of DNA, and extension of annealed primers using a DNA polymerase. The high specificity of PCR rests on the selection of oligonucleotide sequences used to prime the reaction. Following amplification, product DNA can be detected using endonuclease restriction analysis or nucleic acid hybridization. Using PCR, a single viral genome can be detected in tissues which are both fresh as well as formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (Table III) , and is thus a powerful tool with many applications for epidemiology, diagnosis, and research. In 1986, the technique was modified by utilization of the thermostabile DNA polymerase Taq, permitting automation of the reaction (Saiki et al., 1988) . However, it still remains largely a research method which has not yet been widely used for diagnostic pathology purposes. Unfortunately, its applicability in placental pathology is limited by the inability of this technique to localize infections within tissue samples. PCR cannot distinguish maternal from fetal infections in the placenta, as both maternal (blood in intervillus space, decidua) and fetal tissues are in intimate proximity. This limitation has been primarily responsible for confusion in interpretation of early PCR-based studies of placentae from HIV-infected women . However, PCR can be used to screen for agents in placental tissues, which if positive, can subsequently be localized to specific cell types using nucleic acid hybridization or immunohistochemistry. Recently, a technique termed in situ PCR has been developed in which the PCR is performed directly on a slide containing a tissue section, thus combining the high sensivity of PCR with the advantages of tissue localization of in situ hybridization (Nuovo et al., 1991) .

During the performance of the PCR technique, there are many steps when reagent or sample contamination can occur, rendering the results useless. It is thus important to intersperse negative control materials among clinical samples to identify the occurrence of contamination. When using antibody-or nucleic acid-based studies, it is important simultaneously to perform negative control slides to exclude completely the possibility of nonspecific staining. Positive control slides should consist of tissues containing the identical infection, previously confirmed by culture, serology, or other technique, which has been fixed and processed in a similar manner to the unknown clinical specimens. A control block made up of small fragments of individual tissues, each containing a different infectious agent, is often useful to exclude cross-reactivity of reagents with other microbes.",
