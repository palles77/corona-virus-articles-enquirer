Taken together, these results indicate that CD8 + T cells are not required for clinical or histologic disease initiation or progression in TMEV-infected SJL mice. Rather, these data stress the critical role of CD4 + T cells in this capacity and further emphasize the potential for CD8 + T cells to contribute to protection from TMEV-induced demyelination.",

Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is a member of the Picornaviridae family that induces a chronic progressive demyelinating pathology that closely resembles MS in susceptible strains of mice following intracerebral inoculation. TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) is characterized clinically by an abnormal waddling gait resulting from an ascending hind limb spastic paralysis, and histologically by the presence of perivascular in ammatory mononuclear in ltrates within the CNS that result in primary demyelination (Lipton and Dal Canto, 1979; Miller and Karpus, 1994) .",

            "text": "It is believed that the mechanisms involved in the development of demyelination involve both direct and bystander immune-mediated processes as evidenced by the presence of in ammatory CD4 C and CD8 C T cells and macrophages within the target organ (Lipton et al, 1984; Pope et al, 1996) , and to a lesser extent, direct viral damage of oligodendrocytes and microglia due to persistent viral infection (Rodriguez et al, 1983; Graves et al, 1986; Ohara et al, 1990) . However, the exact nature of these immune effector responses and their contribution to disease pathogenesis is still a matter of some controversy. There is considerable evidence from our own lab, as well as others, that indicates a critical role for CD4 C Th1 cells in mediating both the initial and chronic pathogenesis of TMEV-IDD in the susceptible SJL/J strain, as demonstrated by antibody depletion studies (Rodriguez et al, 1986a; Friedmann et al, 1987; Welsh et al, 1987) , the correlation of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses with the severity of disease (Miller et al, 1997) , and the increasing amounts of CD4 C Th1derived pro-in ammatory cytokines expressed in the CNS throughout disease progression (Begolka et al, 1998) . Despite these signi cant ndings, there also exist numerous lines of often contradictory evidence from similar studies conducted in resistant C57BL/6 mice with gene deletions to additionally support the role of CD8 C T cells, not only in viral clearance and protection but also in promoting the demyelinating process (Rodriguez et al, 1986a; Rodriguez and Sriram, 1988; Fiette et al, 1993; Pullen et al, 1993; Njenga et al, 1996; Murray et al, 1998) .",

Our results clearly indicate, in correlation with our previous data in this system, that CD8 C T cells fail to provide a signi cant and demonstrable effector contribution to either the initiation or progression of TMEV-IDD clinical pathology or demyelination. In addition, our data also convincingly demonstrates that the absence of CD8 C T cells leads to an accelerated and more severe disease phenotype, as measured clinically, histologically, and by several in vitro parameters, leading to the conclusion that the role of CD8 C T cells is primarily for protection and/or regulation in this system. These data are consistent with our ongoing model for the SJL/J mouse wherein persistent CNS infection with TMEV leads to the continual activation and clonal expansion of TMEV-speci c, and eventually neuroantigen-speci c, CD4 C Th1 effector cells capable of secreting proin ammatory cytokines and chemokines. These proin ammatory molecules in turn lead to the recruitment and eventual accumulation of activated macrophages/microglia within the CNS resulting in demyelination via a nonspeci c bystander response.",

Viral plaque assays of brain and spinal cord tissue from TMEV-infected 2M-de cient mice at day 50 p.i. revealed a 2-2.5fold increase in viral titer from both the brain and spinal cord as compared to the wild-type control mice ( Figure 4A ).

As expected, homogenized kidney samples from both TMEV-infected groups failed to yield any detectable plaques (data not shown). Semiquantitative RT-PCR from spinal cord samples at this same time point also demonstrated an increase in mRNA levels for the TMEV capsid proteins VP1 and VP3 as seen in the plaque assays (Figure 4B) .

However, as the majority of these studies were conducted using mice on a resistant genetic background (C57BL/6 and 129/J), in this study we sought to determine the outcome of the TMEV-IDD disease phenotype in the absence of CD8 C T cells in the highly susceptible SJL/J mice that were de cient in the expression of\u00af2M. Previous reports examining the effects of this mutation or the MHC class I knockout counterpart have provided evidence that the absence of CD8 C T cells on the resistant background leads to the establishment of chronic demyelination with or without clinical signs, extensive CNS in ltrate, and high viral titers, leading one to conclude that the primary role of these cells is in protection and regulation of disease (Fiette et al, 1993; Pullen et al, 1993; Rodriguez et al, 1993; Rivera-Quinones et al, 1998; Lavi et al, 1999) . The current results support this central role for CD8 C T cells, with Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of cytokine mRNA levels from the spinal cords of TMEV-infected\u00af2M-de cient and wildtype control SJL mice. At 50 days p.i., three mice per group were sacri ced by perfusion and spinal cord RNA was isolated. This total RNA served as the template for RT-PCR as detailed in Materials and Methods. Shown in panel A are the gel images of the ampli ed products for the control transcript HPRT, the macrophage/microglia cell surface marker F4/80, and the macrophage-derived proin ammatory mediators, TNF-\u00ae, IL-12, IL-10, and iNOS. Shown in panel B are the ampli ed products of the effector T cell marker CD4 and the T cell-derived cytokines IFN-\u00b0, IL-4, and TNF-\u00af(lymphotoxin). Shown in panel C are the densitometry values for the ampli ed cytokine products in panels A/B following normalization to the housekeeping gene, HPRT. The data are expressed as a percentage of normalized HPRT expression. Results are representative of two separate experiments. the secondary conclusion that CD4 C effector T cells are suf cient to mediate disease pathogenesis.",

In addition, in one experiment where the mice were allowed to progress to beyond 55 days p.i., 5 out of 11\u00af2M-de cient mice progressed to a clinical score of 4, with several mice eventually succumbing to the disease by day 60, an observation rarely seen with the wildtype SJL mouse (data not shown). Second, the severe clinical disease in the\u00af2M-de cient mice also correlated with the presence of large numbers of inammatory in ltrates comprised mainly of activated macrophages/microglia in conjunction with extensive white matter demyelination as compared to the control mice. Expression of cytokine mRNA from the CNS of infected mice additionally con rms the increase in activated macrophage/microglia in ltrate as well as their secreted pro-in ammatory mediators known to promote the CD4 C Th1 environment. Third, 2M-de cient mice were effectively able to mount a speci c immune response to both virus and myelin epitopes that was at a minimum equivalent to, yet often exceeded, that of wild-type controls. Last,\u00af2Mde cient mice were signi cantly hampered in their ability to control viral persistence in both the brain and spinal cord.",

This correlation between outcomes regardless of the genetic background lends strong support to the distinct roles of CD4 C and CD8 C T cells in the TMEV model. Although data indicating the pivotal role of CD4 C T cells in the pathogenesis of TMEV-IDD have been previously reported, an equally compelling body of work also demonstrates the critical role CD8 C T cells play in the control of disease susceptibility. It has been clearly shown that : 1) susceptibility/resistance to TMEV maps to Class I H-2D (Clatch et al, 1985; Rodriguez and David, 1985; Rodriguez et al, 1986b; Kappel et al, 1991) ; 2) monoclonal antibody depletion of CD8 C T cells leads to earlier onset and increased disease severity ; 3) virus-speci c CTLs are found at a higher frequency in the CNS of resistant mice than susceptible mice, and in vivo IL-2 therapy can effectively boost CTL responses in susceptible strains and diminish viral persistence (Lindsley et al, 1991; Pena Rossi et al, 1991; Lin et al, 1995; Dethlefs et al, 1997) ; 4) perforin KO mice on the normally resistant C57BL/6 background are able to be persistently in-fected with TMEV (Pena-Rossi et al, 1998); and 5) in the BALB/c system, transfer of a CD8 C population from the spleen of TMEV-infected donors protects recipients from disease induction (Nicholson et al, 1996; Haynes et al, 2000) . Taken as a whole, our data in the susceptible SJL/J mouse supplement and are consistent with these previously documented observations and further support a critical role for CD8 C T cells in regulating disease susceptibility and severity.",

There are several possible explanations for these observed differences. With regard to the absence of CD4 C T cells leading to an exacerbated disease, the ability to provide cognate B cell to help production of antibody to control the peripheral and CNS viremia is critically impaired (Borrow et al, 1993) . This is supported by the fact that the anti-TMEV humoral response in susceptible animals is unable to completely clear the virus but is capable of dramatically limiting the spread early in the infection (Lipton and Gonzalez-Scarano, 1978) . To that end, CD4-de cient animals die of an overwhelming virally mediated encephalitis within 25 days p.i. (Rodriguez and Sriram, 1988) . The depletion of CD4 C T cells in the chronic stages of TMEV-IDD has not been directly addressed in the literature to this point, however, given the compelling evidence for a pathologic role of myelin-speci c autoimmunity in chronic disease progression (Miller et al, 1997) , it is strongly believed that in ltrating CD4 C T cells contribute more signi cantly to disease progression than its regulation. Our lab has recently addressed this hypothesis through the use of tolerance to a panel of myelin autoepitopes at later time during chronic disease with the observed outcome of diminished clinical score and decreased demyelinating pathology (manuscript submitted). In addition, as it has been demonstrated that susceptible mice are capable of mounting virus-speci c CTL responses (Lindsley et al, 1991) , it is interesting to note that CD4 C T cells have been reported to be required to perpetuate longterm CTL reactivity when infections become persistent, as in the case of LCMV (Matloubian et al, 1994) .",

            "text": "The observation that the absence of CD8 C T cells leads to a less severe disease is more dif cult to reconcile with our data (Rivera-Quinones et al, 1998) . It is possible that differences related to the strain of virus used (DA vs BeAn) may be a contributing factor, as it has not been completely determined what type of CD8 C responses are elicited during active infection with each strain of virus. It is well documented in both human and mouse that na\u1e4fve CD8 C T cells are capable of differentiating into Tc1 or Tc2 populations, analogous to Th1 and Th2 cells, depending on the cytokine environment present during initial stimulation (Croft et al, 1994; Seder and Le Gros, 1995; Carter and Dutton, 1996) . Tc1 development is promoted by IL-18, IL-12, and IFN-\u00b0leading to more of a cytolytic response, whereas Tc2 development is promoted by IL-4 leading to a predominant regulatory response (Li et al, 1997) . It is possible, then, that in the resistant C57BL/6 strain, where virus is cleared rapidly, that the predominant response is Tc1 in nature. This idea is supported by data indicating that C57BL/6-perforin KO mice are able to be persistently infected with TMEV (Pena-Rossi et al, 1998) , and that the absence of CD8 C T cells leads to viral titers that are dramatically increased (Figure 4) (Fiette et al, 1993; Pullen et al, 1993; Rodriguez et al, 1993; Rivera-Quinones et al, 1998; Lavi et al, 1999) . This would be in contrast to the susceptible SJL/J strain where the predominant response may be Tc2 in nature, and/or minimally a weak Tc1, and the initial viremia is controlled, but not cleared. These mice, although capable of mounting a cytolytic response during active infection, must be dependent on additional mechanisms to support viral clearance, with the most likely candidate being antibody-dependent responses. This is supported by our observation that the majority of\u00af2M-de cient mice, while displaying an accelerated disease onset and severity of TMEV-IDD, do not succumb to the pathology until after 60 days p.i. Their rapid progression of disease is then most likely a combination of increased viral titer leading to enhanced immune inltrate and demyelination rather than a virally mediated encephalitis, indicative of a signi cant regulatory response that is now absent.",
