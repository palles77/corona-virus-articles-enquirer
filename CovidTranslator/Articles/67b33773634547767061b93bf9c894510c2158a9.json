On February 27, the epidemic regions were modified as a history of travel to or residence in a country, area or territory that has reported local transmission of COVID-19 disease and added a clinical criteria of a patient with severe acute respiratory infection requiring hospitalization. 5 In the US, CDC offered the first criteria to guide evaluation of patients under investigation for COVID-19 on January 17, 2020. 6 Patients who have fever and/or symptoms of lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) and in the last 14 days before symptom onset, have a history of travel from Wuhan City, China, OR close contact with a person who is under investigation for COVID-19 while that person was ill or an ill laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patient should be evaluated. Later, a history of travel expanded from Wuhan city to Hubei Province, and even mainland China for those requiring hospitalization on February 1, 7 and to affected geographic regions where sustained community transmission has been identified on February 28. 8 With the testing capacity of COVID-19 diagnostic testing allowing clinicians to consider testing for a wider group of symptomatic patients, clinicians were strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness (e.g., influenza) in the latest update guidance on March 8. 9 10 All the committee members agreed to include COVID-19 as one of the category 5 notifiable diseases, and on January 15, 2020, COVID-19 was announced to be included as such. The first reporting criteria of COVID-19 was drafted on January 7, 2020 under an urgent circumstance.",

However, several issues were raised. First, while the reporting criteria was modified and evolved from time to time, the clinicians who might encounter the potential cases of COVID-19 should keep an eye on the announcement (mostly the website) of Taiwan CDC to timely catch the changing criteria. Second, not only the clinicians but also the potential cases of COVID-19 were confused in whom fulfilled the reporting criteria and should (could) have a laboratory test. Third, while the order of a laboratory test was restricted to the reporting criteria, the clinician was not allowed to test a suspected patient not fulfilling the criteria until the criteria was expanded to those without a history of travel to epidemic regions or contact with a confirmed case. Subsequently, four cases of CAP were confirmed to be caused by SARS-CoV-2 during hospitalization and one of them (National COVID-19 Case Sequence No. 34) inevitably resulted in the first hospital outbreak of COVID-19 in Taiwan. A clinician's judgement cannot be overlooked. Fourth, while the reporting criteria was expanded, the guidance for caring for the reporting cases under investigation was not modified simultaneously, which subsequently resulted in the exhaustion of personal protection equipment and full occupancy of negative pressure isolation rooms.",

In cases of CAP, a patient without a history of traveling to epidemic regions could be regarded as a reporting case after the clinical physician excluded other possible etiologic agent and highly suspected of SARs-CoV-2 as the potential etiology. SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the etiologic agent of COVID-19 on January 7 in China and a nucleic acid-based detection method was established and distributed by WHO on January 12. Because the first version of reporting criteria of COVID-19 was drafted and announced on January 7, no laboratory criteria was provided initially. The laboratory criteria of detection of SARS-CoV-2 either by virus culture or nucleic acid-based methods was then added in the second version on January 20 and was not modified since established and announced. Among the reporting criteria, the most evolving criteria was the epidemiologic criteria. In most countries, the initial epidemiologic criteria was relatively simple, clear-cut and included a history of traveling to China or close contact with a person known to have COVID-19. However, Taiwan is close to, 81 miles off the coast of, mainland China and among the 23 million citizens, 850,000 reside in and 404,000 work in China. 10,12,13 Moreover, 2.71 million visitors from the mainland traveled to Taiwan in 2019. 14 The connection between Taiwan and China is tight. In addition, COVID-19 occurred just before the Lunar New Year during which time millions of Taiwanese were expected to return from China for the festivals. If the reporting criteria was established initially as other countries, a huge number of patients would satisfy the reporting criteria of COVID-19, and should be admitted to the designated hospitals for laboratory test of SARS-CoV-2, which would subsequently result in the crisis of medical care loading in all the designated hospitals. Taiwan CDC set up a term of \"epidemic regions\" and expanded the regions step by step, depending on the ongoing epidemics, from only Wuhan area first, then Hubei province, Guangdong province, Henan and Zhejiang provinces etc.. Regions or countries outside mainland China, such as Hong Kong, Macau, Korea, and Italy etc., were added in the list of epidemic regions gradually.",
