            "text": "Poliovirus (PV), a member of the genus Enterovirus (family Picornaviridae), has been used as a model organism for the study of non-enveloped virus life cycles. Although the detailed molecular basis of PV replication is not fully understood, it is clear that viral replication depends on interactions with host factors for viral gene expression, RNA replication, and virus assembly (Andino et al., 1993; Belov et al., 2003 Belov et al., , 2004 Egger et al., 2000) . However, the specific functions of these host cellular factors have yet to be determined. Despite decades of studying mechanisms of viral replication, the development of systematic protocols to identify factors modulating the virus life cycle has been minimal. With advances in chemical genomics, having access to chemical libraries of compounds with diverse functions is no longer the limiting factor. The emergence of high-throughput screening (HTS) has called for the development of an accurate and efficient reporter system. A cell-based reporter assay for the identification of small molecules suppressing PV replication was established in previous study (Hwang et al., 2006) . Cell-based assays are ideal for developing high-throughput methodology because they provide information to address issues raised from chemical-based in vitro studies, such as cytotoxicity caused by treatment, drug transport efficiency to the cell, and the effective doses of target compounds, and thus are ideal for developing high-throughput methodologies. However, cell-based platform available to elucidate the roles of host factors in viral replication remains limited. In an attempt to fulfill the demand for an effective screening protocol of inhibitors against virus replication, we established a cellular platform to exploit the potential application for HTS.",

FRET is a phenomenon involving two fluorochromes with overlapping emission and excitation spectra. The energy from the donor fluorophore is partially transferred to the acceptor if the distance between the two fluorophores is less than 60\u00c5 protein (ECFP) and an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) FRET pair linked with the 2A pro cleavage sequences (Hwang et al., 2006) . The PV 2A pro , which is produced at an early stage of the replication cycle (Cao et al., 1993) , cleaves the linker peptide flanking the FRET pair; the separation of the fluorescent protein pair was monitored using fluorescence microscopy ( Fig. 1) .",

For the primary screening, the reporter cells were seeded in 384-well plates with the culture medium and infected with PV 1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. The culture medium was removed by aspiration and the virus suspension in DMEM with one of the bioactive small molecules was added to each well. N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethylketone (MPCMK) (Sigma-Aldrich), a known 2A pro inhibitor, was included as a positive control (Fig. 1B) . Samples were incubated for 7.5 h at 37 \u2022 C, and then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 5 min. The samples were examined under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U) with CFP (excitation wavelength of 436 nm and emission wavelength of 460 nm) and YFP (excitation wave-length of 500 nm and emission wavelength of 535 nm) filter set.",

A cell proliferationbased MTT assay (CHEMICON, Temecula, CA) was used to examine the level of cytotoxicity due to drug treatment. MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrasodium bromide, is based on the ability of a mitochondrial dehydrogenase from living cells to cleave the tetrazolium rings of the pale yellow MTT and form dark blue formazan crystals that absorb light at a wavelength of 570 nm. A viral titer reduction assay using conventional plaque assay was conducted to verify the potency of the selected compounds from the primary screening. The tested compounds were dissolved in DMSO with a stock concentration of 10 mM, and the working solutions were diluted in DMEM to achieve desired concentrations. Each compound was tested at four concentrations, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 M, in triplicate. BGMK cells were seeded in 24-well plates (Corning) and infected with PV 1 at a MOI of 10. After adsorption, 1 ml of an appropriate concentration of the test compound was added to each well. The supernatant from the wells containing infected cells was collected after 8 h of incubation and the viral titer of each sample was determined using plaque assay. Anisomycin achieved 2 log 10 unit reduction of virus titer at 1.25 M with negligible cytotoxicity (Fig. 2A) . Anisomycin, originally discovered as a peptidyl transferase inhibitor secreted by Streptomyces spp., is also a potent activator of mitogenactivated protein (MAP) kinase cascades (Barros et al., 1997; Grollman, 1967; Zinck et al., 1995) . Anisomycin showed strong inhibition against PV replication in this study ( Fig. 2A) as well as in prior reports (Ehrenfeld and Manis, 1979; Hazzalin et al., 1998) . Linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid, showed only 0.52 log 10 unit reduction of virus titer at 10 M (Fig. 2B) . Lycorine caused 1 log 10 unit reduction of virus titer at 2.5 M with no signs of cytotoxicity (Fig. 2C) . Earlier studies have demonstrated that lycorine, a TNF-\u2423 production inhibitor found in plant species Lycoris and Narcissus (Vrijsen et al., 1986) exhibits antiviral against PV replication, herpes simplex virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Ieven et al., 1982; Li et al., 2005; Renard-Nozaki et al., 1989) . Both anisomycin and lycorine exhibited strong antiviral activity against PV replication, with anisomycin being the most potent compound among all that were tested; however, linoleic acid was not a significant PV inhibitor at the condition tested (Fig. 2) .",

It has been reported that cycloheximide, a translational elongation inhibitor, blocks general virus replication due to the fact that the host protein synthesis is impaired upon drug treatment, thus the host cells fail to support virus growth (Barton et al., 1999) . A potent PV replication inhibitor, brefeldin A, which blocks GTP cycling and results in the disruption of the Golgi complex, also scored positive in the screening (Crotty et al., 2004) . Chao et al. (2001) , has shown that U-50488, a calcium channel inhibitor, inhibits HIV-1 protein expression. Lipid metabolism is thought to be associated with the modulation of virus replication (Kapadia and Chisari, 2005; Cherry et al., 2006) . We identified three compounds, ciglitazone (PPAR \u2425 agonist), FCCP (carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, mitochondrial uncoupler), and linoleic acid, that target the peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors (PPAR) signaling pathway, which is involved in the signal transduction cascade of fatty acid and lipid metabolism (Nedergaard et al., 2001; Latruffe and Vamecq, 1997) . In addition, this study also identified other small molecules involved in pathways that are novel for their association with PV replication, such as AG-879, GW-5074, ouabain, and trequinsin (Table 1) . Further investigation of the roles of these compounds in PV replication is needed to advance the understanding of the mechanisms involved.",

Cells with active 2A pro activity are shown in green, while cells without proteolysis are in yellow. The cells were mock infected (C) or infected with PV1 at an input MOI of 10 and treated with DMSO only (A), 1 mM MPCMK (B), 31.4 M anisomycin (D), 1.7 M linoleic acid (E), or 25.7 M lycorine (F).
