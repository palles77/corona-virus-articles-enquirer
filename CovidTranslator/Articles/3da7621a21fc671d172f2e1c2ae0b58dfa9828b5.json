Perhaps most notably, in the early 1960s, Alexander D.Langmuir, MD, Director of the Epidemic Intelligence Service and EpidemiologyProgram at CDC began to work closely with Donald A. Henderson, MD, Chief of the Virus Disease Surveillance Program at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). and in the United States on January 22, 2020.6 During that interval containment was potentially achievable in the United States, which would have included collaborative efforts such as the widespread utilization of the rapid testing kits available from the World Health Organization. At present, however, strategies must be employed to flatten the curve to decrease avoidable morbidity and mortality which include, but are not limited to, widespread testing with rapid turnaround, and social distancing.[1][2][3][4][5] In addition, some reports provide reassurance and others an ominous foreboding. At present, the current incomplete totality of evidence provides causes for serious concerns and, more importantly, an urgent need for public health leadership, but neither reassurance nor alarm.as the general public, should remain fully cognizant that the young and healthy are not free of risk of death, but there are large segments of the population at highest risk. These include adults \u226560 years old, those with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and lung disease, as well as those receiving chemotherapy or who are otherwise immunocompromised through illness or therapies. These guestimates about the numbers of cases will become more reliable with more widespread and accurate testing. It is somewhat sobering to note that South Korea, which has a population about 1/6 th that of the UnitedWith respect to influenza, in the flu season from 2018 to 2019, about 42.9 million Americans were clinical cases, of which 647,000 were hospitalized and about 61,200 died. Based on the existing incomplete totality of evidence it appears that coronavirus is comparable in communicability to influenza but with perhaps a 10 fold higher case fatality rate. If so, the guestimates suggest that if the epidemic continues to propagate in the US there may be 612,000 deaths and perhaps millions of hospitalizations. This staggering estimate of number of hospitalizations could paralyze the US healthcare delivery system. Further, the overcrowding of hospitals by patients with coronavirus may make it more difficult to provide lifesaving treatments to those with other life-threatening conditions. In addition, this number of deaths is comparable to the most lethal epidemic of influenza in US history which occurred in 1918.",
