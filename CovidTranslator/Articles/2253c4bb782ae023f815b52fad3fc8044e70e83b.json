On one hand, these therapies are of limited effectiveness and on the other hand, side-effects and systemic toxicity may limit their application, particularly in paediatric, geriatric and compromised patients (Reusser 1996; Cassady and Whitley 1997; Bacon et al. 2003; Hayden et al. 1983; Janai et al. 1990; Englund et al. 1990 ).

Interestingly, about 10% of the more than 4000 species studied showed a significant antiviral activity in vitro (Che 1991) . Innumerable potentially useful medicinal plants and herbs are waiting to be evaluated and exploited for therapeutic applications against genetically and functionally diverse virus families (Jassim and Naji 2003) . Several hundred already investigated plant and herb species have potential as novel antiviral agents (Jassim and Naji 2003) . However, for the majority of species studied so far, systematic investigation of their activity against a broad panel of viruses still remains to be done. Summerfield et al. described the Acanthospermum hispidum (Summerfield et al. 1997 ) activity against animal pathogenic herpes viruses, pseudorabiesvirus (PRV) and bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1). More recently, Glatthaar-Saalm\u00fcller et al. (2001) were able to show antiviral activity of an extract from Eleutherococcus senticosus against human rhinovirus (HRV), human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A virus, which was discussed as RNAvirus specific reactivity. In addition, a very broad antiviral activity 0944-7113/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.phymed.2011.10.010 of the homeopathic preparation of Gripp-Heel was demonstrated to act against human herpesvirus (HSV-1), human adenovirus (HAV), human parainfluenza virus, human coxsackievirus, influenza A virus, HRV, and RSV, which might be based on the induction of type 1 interferons (Glatthaar 2007) by the respective substances. Nevertheless, no detailed information is yet available on the exact mode of antiviral action of plant extracts.",

The IC 50 of the dry extract preparation was comparable to that of oral drops with toxicity limits for all cell lines being higher than 500 g/ml.

Ethanol controls used in the assays for toxicity at a final concentration of 3.8% (V/V) showed slightly reduced metabolism.

Consequently, the preparation of oral drops used for the evaluation of the antiviral activity was adjusted to an ethanol content of less than 0.38% (V/V) corresponding to the highest concentration of 120 g/ml. Accordingly Sinupret dry extract was adjusted to a concentration of 100 g/ml with a maximum ethanol content of 0.59% (V/V) as the highest concentration used in the antiviral tests with the exception of the additional tests on FluA and pFluA where 500 g/ml with a maximum ethanol content of 0.25% was used as the highest concentration.
