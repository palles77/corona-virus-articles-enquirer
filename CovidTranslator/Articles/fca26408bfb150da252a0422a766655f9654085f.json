Several European Member States report an optimal average time-to-response (TTR) of less than 10 seconds for answering an emergency call 1 . The spread of 2019-nCoV in Italy represented a serious burden in terms of increase in calls to the DCs due to the dangerous combination of panic and misinformation with a risk to increase the delay in intervention on critical cases 2 . We hereby describe the impact of the news of 2019-nCoV spread on the number of calls and response-related parameters of the major dispatch centre of the Emilia Romagna (ER) region and the measures taken in order to restore the service optimal efficiency. The ER region has three different dispatch centres (Emilia Ovest , Emilia Est and Romagna) with a covered population of 4.5 millions inhabitants and Emilia Est Dispatch Centre (EE-DC) covers Bologna, Ferrara and Modena provinces, with a population of around 2.5 million people. The first person-to-person 2019-nCoV transmission in Italy was reported on February 21 th , 2020 3 . During the first three days after, a threefold increase in terms of calls to the EE-DC was observed with a total number of daily calls raising from 1141 on February 17 th to 3290 on February 24 th (Figure 1 ). During the morning of Sunday 23 th , in return for the progressive increase in terms of calls from the province of Piacenza (belonging to Emilia Ovest area), the nearest province to the outbreak area in Lombardy, a series of emergency measures aiming to optimize the dispatch centres performances were adopted:",

Furthermore, PHPs were then integrated in dispatch issues, in order to help centralize suspected and confirmed 2019-nCoV patients. Eventually, PHPs became available for consultation by all EMS crews; \u2022 The ER Region on February 25 th was released a dedicated number for 2019-nCoV In terms of TTR issue, two days had the worst performances: February 23 th and 24th registered response times up to 16 seconds. Thus, upon a threefold increasing in received calls, TTR increased by 60% for two days and was rapidly restored under 10 sec. within Feb. 26th. Globally, the reorganization of the EMS allowed to maintain acceptable response times despite the abrupt increase of the number of calls. ",
