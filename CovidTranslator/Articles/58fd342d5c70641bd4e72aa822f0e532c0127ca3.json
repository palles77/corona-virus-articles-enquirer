We have performed an integrated sequence-based analysis of SARS-CoV2 genomes from different geographical locations in order to identify its unique features absent in SARS-CoV and other related coronavirus family genomes, conferring unique infection, facilitation of transmission, virulence and immunogenic features to the virus. The phylogeny of the genomes yields some interesting results. Systematic gene level mutational analysis of the genomes has enabled us to identify several unique features of the SARS-CoV2 genome, which includes a unique mutation in the spike surface glycoprotein (A930V (24351C>T)) in the Indian SARS-CoV2, absent in other strains studied here. We have also predicted the impact of the mutations in the spike glycoprotein function and stability, using computational approach. To gain further insights into host responses to viral infection, we predict that antiviral host-miRNAs may be controlling the viral pathogenesis. Our analysis reveals nine host miRNAs which can potentially target SARS-CoV2 genes. Interestingly, the nine miRNAs do not have targets in SARS and MERS genomes. Also, hsa-miR-27b is the only unique miRNA which has a target gene in the Indian SARS-CoV2 genome. We also predicted immune epitopes in the genomes",

Probably presence of the unique mutations identified in the genome from Italy are responsible for the sudden upsurge in the number of affected cases and deaths (2), combined with other factors-a speculation which maybe verified with more evidences.

This is surprising and is of utmost importance along with our other novel finding of a unique mutation identified in the spike surface glycoprotein (A930V (24351C>T)) in the Indian sequence. The target of the hsa-miR-27b sequence is the location containing A930V mutation in the spike surface glycoprotein which perhaps, should be explored further, experimentally. Reports have demonstrated the ability of miR-27b to inhibit HIV-1 replication (28) . There are contradicting reports regarding the use of HIV antiviral regimen for SARS-CoV2 infection showing no effects in China (29) while the Indian Council of Medical Research (India) has given the guidelines for the use of HIV treatment in these cases as some of the patients showed improvement with the administration. A few other drugs, including FDA approved antiviral and antimalarials are being used with significant claimed-successes.

However, interestingly we also observed that each genome has unique mutations-except the genome from Nepal which shares 100% similarity with the Wuhan genome.We found that Indian SARS-CoV2 have mutations in orf1ab, nsp2, nsp3, helicase, ORF8 protein and spike surface glycoprotein(Table 3). Spike glycoprotein multiple sequence alignment (S. Figure1) with SARS-CoV2(India), SARS-CoV2 (China, Wuhan) and SARS-Cov(2003) clearly shows the replacement of A to V (24351C>T) at 930 position which are absent in other query genomes namely Italy, USA and Nepal along with SARS-CoV(Table 3). I296V, P1261L and T214I mutations in NSP2, NSP3 and helicase are specific to India SARS-CoV2.While comparing SARS-CoV2 sequence from Italy with that of Wuhan SARS-CoV2, we observed 3 deletions at 3606 th and 37 th position which correspond to orf1ab and NSP6 protein(Table 3).
