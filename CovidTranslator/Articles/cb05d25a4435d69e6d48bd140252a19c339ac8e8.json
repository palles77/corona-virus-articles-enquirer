The sporadic nature of these infections hampers our understanding of these diseases and limits the opportunities to design appropriate medical countermeasures against them. Because of this, animal models are utilized to gain insight into the pathogenesis of disease with the overall goal of identifying potential targets for intervention and evaluating specific therapeutics and vaccines. For these reasons it is imperative that animal models of disease recapitulate the human condition as closely as possible in order to provide the best predictive data with respect to the potential efficacy in humans.

Recent examples include Lujo virus, which caused five known human infections in Southern Africa, four of which were fatal, and represents the first pathogenic arenavirus discovered in Africa in over forty years; Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome virus, a previously unidentified tick-borne bunyavirus which emerged in China with mortality rates as high as 30%; and a novel coronavirus which is responsible for severe acute respiratory distress in humans in the Middle East [1 ,2,3] .

In situations where evaluating the efficacy of medical countermeasures in humans is impractical, preclinical testing of therapeutics relies on the use of animal models of disease. Regulating this process, the United States Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Animal Rule provides guidelines relating to study design and endpoints, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and the appropriateness of animal models which must be followed in order to utilize data generated from in vivo disease models for licensing purposes [4] .

In addition to these conditions the Animal Rule stipulates that in vivo models must be based on a challenge virus that is a wild-type etiological agent of human disease. In general, nonhuman primates (NHPs, including Cynomolgus and Rhesus macaques, African Green Monkeys and Marmosets) fulfill the criteria of the FDA Animal Rule for most highly pathogenic viruses, making them the gold-standard for studying pathogenesis and evaluating potential medical countermeasures, although it should be noted that not all NHP species are equally susceptible to all agents.",

In general, the pathogenesis of emerging viral diseases in humans is poorly defined and not well understood. Because of safety concerns, autopsies are rarely conducted on fatal human cases suspected to have died from a highly pathogenic viral agent. Further, the remote locations where cases typically occur limits the availability of sophisticated instruments required to thoroughly analyze specimens collected during the course of disease. In this regard, the disease course in NHPs is often better defined than the human condition which it is meant to model and therefore, much of our current understanding of pathogenesis for many high consequence viral pathogens has come from experimental infections of NHPs. On the basis of the similarity to humans, NHP models provide the best predicative value as to how a specific therapeutic or vaccine will work in humans. However, it should be noted that even when a vaccine or therapeutic is thoroughly evaluated in NHP models, there is still uncertainty regarding its efficacy in humans since for this group of agents no human vaccines or therapeutics have been thoroughly evaluated in humans ( Table 1 ).",

While imperative to advancing our understanding of pathogenesis, knockout mice, especially those with impaired immunological functions, are not ideal for testing therapeutics and therefore will not be discussed further. Similarly, although suckling mice have commonly been used as an initial determination of virulence especially for arboviruses, they cannot be utilized in therapeutic or vaccine studies and therefore will not be further discussed. Often, wild-type high consequence viruses do not cause disease in immunocompetent adult mice; however, mouse models have been developed by serially passaging specific agents resulting in hostadapted viruses. Perhaps the most utilized mouse model for emerging viruses is the mouse-adapted Ebola model [5] . Following inoculation via the intraperitoneal route, mice infected with mouse-adapted Ebola virus develop lethal disease which appears similar to human Ebola virus infection with respect to high titer viremia, tissue tropism, lymphocyte apoptosis and cytokine production. However, mice infected with the adapted Ebola virus variant lack the characteristic coagulopathy which is an important hallmark of Ebola hemorrhagic fever. The overall impact of the lack of coagulopathy in mice is uncertain; however recent reviews of the published literature suggest the predictive power of testing therapeutic in the mouse model is rather low [5] . Historically, Guinea pigs have been utilized as secondary models following mice and before higher order models like NHPs. Similar to mouse models, the development of lethal disease models in 206 Emerging viruses Table 1 Advantages and disadvantages of commonly used animals in disease models Guinea pigs often require host adaption of pathogens, for example, Guinea pig-adapted Ebola. The use of Guinea pig disease models is further hampered by a lack of commercially available reagents which diminishes the ability to completely characterize disease in these animals. However, their use as model animals is imperative, especially for viral pathogens which are naturally harbored by mice or rats, for example arenaviruses. Lassa and Lujo viruses readily infect and cause disease in inbred strain 13 Guinea pigs without earlier host-adaption [6] .",

In 2001, a hamster model of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) was described in which hamsters challenged with the highly pathogenic South American Andes virus develop signs of disease which accurately mimic human HPS. To date the hamster model of HPS remains the only described disease model for this relatively rare, but frequently fatal disease of humans [7] . The highly pathogenic paramyxoviruses Nipah and Hendra lethally infect hamsters with disease manifestations similar to those observed in humans [8] . Importantly, depending on the challenge dose of Nipah or Hendra virus, hamsters develop either neurological or respiratory signs of disease, which are the predominant disease symptoms in humans [9] . The similarities in disease manifestations, coupled with the overall ease of handling of these animals makes the hamster model of Nipah and Hendra virus disease the preferred small animal model over other described options including ferrets and cats. A hamster model for Ebola virus hemorrhagic fever was also recently described, and although it is based on an adapted virus (mouse-adapted Ebola virus), the disease course in hamsters appears to more closely resemble the human condition, including coagulopathy [10] . Although to date a few studies have been published utilizing the recently described hamster model of Ebola hemorrhagic fever, the similarities in disease manifestations observed in hamsters and NHPs, suggest the results of efficacy testing of vaccines or therapeutics against Ebola virus infection in the hamsters will be more predicative of results in the NHP model and presumably, humans [11 ] .",

The commercially available stocks of Syrian hamsters in North America were established over 60 years ago and are all offspring of three initial animals [11 ] . Despite the initial genetic bottleneck, colonies of Animal models for highly pathogenic emerging viruses Safronetz, Geisbert and Feldmann 207 Syrian hamsters are outbred though genetically and immunologically these animals are not well characterized. It is plausible that hamsters are deficient in specific host responses which enhance the virulence of human pathogens. For example, it has been previously demonstrated that hamsters have muted inducible nitric oxide response, which may increase susceptibility to specific pathogens [12] . The main detraction of hamster models is the extremely limited amount of commercially available reagents. Currently the impetus for reagent development falls on individual laboratories specializing in hamster models, however in order for these models to gain momentum and become thoroughly characterized, the commercial sector will need to become involved ( Table  2 ).",

Guinea pigs models are available for wild-type (nonhost adapted) Lassa and Lujo viruses, and although further characterization is necessary, these models should qualify as appropriate disease models. The use of hamsters in this line of research is gaining interest and in the past few years models for Andes virus (HPS), Nipah and Hendra viruses have been comprehensively characterized and should be considered as first line models for these agents. Although many small animal models do not conform to the Animal Rule their use in evaluating vaccines and model-appropriate therapeutics should not be discounted.

It is important to note that although preferable, it is not always necessary to demonstrate a beneficial result of a specific medical countermeasure in two disease models. The NHP will always be considered as the apex model for evaluating vaccines and therapeutics against highly pathogenic viruses, and in some situations the only appropriate model. For example, many agents discussed in this article are known to have immunomodulatory effects in humans. Although proof of concept experiments could be performed in small animal models, based on the vast differences in the immune systems of humans and rodents, any therapy aimed at reversing or minimizing deleterious immune responses associated with specific viral agents could only accurately be modeled in NHPs and possibly humanized mice. Under appropriate study conditions most if not all disease models, even those which do not completely meet the criteria set forth by the FDA, can be utilized to address specific scientific questions; therefore in the correct settings these models will provide valuable information regarding pathogenesis and/or therapeutic or vaccine efficacy.
