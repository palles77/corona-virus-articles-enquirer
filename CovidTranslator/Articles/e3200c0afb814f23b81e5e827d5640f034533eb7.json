Fecal samples were collected weekly for 4 weeks from each of 1045 calves under 30 days of age on 11 dairy farms in south-western Ontario during the summer of 2003 and the winter of 2004. A questionnaire designed to gather information on calf-level management factors was administered on farm for each calf in the study. Samples were examined for C. parvum oocysts by microscopy, and a subset of specimens was also tested for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella, bovine rotavirus and bovine coronavirus. The consistency of each sample was scored and recorded at the time of collection in order to assess the presence or absence of diarrhea. In addition, a blood sample was taken from each calf upon enrolment in the study, for assessment of maternal antibody transfer and for polymerase chain reaction testing for persistent bovine viral diarrhea virus infection. Using the GLLAMM function in Stata 9.0, multilevel regression techniques were employed to investigate associations between management practices and the risk of C. parvum shedding or diarrhea.",

Furthermore, 73% of the 846 calves for which all four fecal consistency scores had been recorded were diarrheic at the time of collection of at least one sample. Significant predictors of the calflevel risk of C. parvum shedding included the use of calf diarrhea prophylaxis in pregnant cows, and the type of maternity facilities in which the calves were born. Factors associated with an increased risk of diarrhea were leaving the calf with the dam for more than an hour after birth, and the birth of a calf in the summer as www.elsevier.com/locate/prevetmed Preventive Veterinary Medicine 82 (2007) 12-28 opposed to winter. Calves shedding C. parvum oocysts had 5.3 (95% CI 4.4, 6.4) times the odds of diarrhea than non-shedding calves, controlling for other factors included in the final multivariable model. Furthermore, infected calves shedding more than 2.2 \u00c2 10 5 oocysts per gram of feces were more likely to scour than infected calves shedding lower numbers of oocysts (OR = 6.1, 95% CI 4.8, 7.8). The odds of diarrhea in calves shedding oocysts that had been allowed to remain with their dams for more than an hour were higher than the odds of diarrhea in shedding calves that had been separated from their dams within an hour after birth. #",

            "text": "Cryptosporidium parvum is a ubiquitous intestinal protozoan parasite that commonly infects dairy calves in the first month of life. Mortality may occur in severely affected animals, but, more often, a self-limiting secretory diarrhea results in morbidity and increased labour and veterinary costs (de Graaf et al., 1999) . Infected animals usually shed large numbers of infective oocysts in the feces (Nydam et al., 2001) . Detection of these oocysts, or of C. parvum antigen in feces, is the usual means of diagnosis. In dairy calves, the prevalence of shedding has been reported to be highest among animals 7-21 days of age, with a pre-patent period of 3-6 days (de Graaf et al., 1999) . Studies in Canada have reported the prevalence of shedding among dairy calves 0-24 weeks of age to be 15-59% (Olson et al., 1997a,b) . In another study, O'Handley et al. (1999) reported a period prevalence of shedding of 100% among dairy calves from birth to 4 months old on a farm in Alberta, Canada. In 2002, 40 .6% of 500 calves aged 7-21 days on 51 dairy farms in south-western Ontario were found to be shedding oocysts (Trotz-Williams et al., 2005a) .",

A longitudinal study conducted in the United States (USA) found that infected calves were more likely to be found on farms using multi-cow maternity facilities than on those using single-cow facilities (Garber et al., 1994) . Frequent bedding changes in the calf housing area, and increased contact between calves, have also been identified as factors associated with an increased risk of C. parvum shedding in dairy calves in the USA (Sischo et al., 2000) . Using a cross-sectional study design, Mohammed et al. (1999) found that feeding milk replacer, use of antibiotics and use of fan or exhaust ventilation in calf rearing areas were all associated with a decreased risk of shedding on dairy farms in New York State, USA. In a cross-sectional study conducted in Mexico, use of hay bedding in the maternity area, sweeping the maternity area and feeding starter grain to dairy calves were identified as practices associated with increased shedding of C. parvum (Maldonado-Camargo et al., 1998) .",

This approach was employed to control for clustering at the herd-level, and repeated observations at the calf-level. During screening, the dependent (outcome) variable used to represent the risk of C. parvum shedding was a dichotomous variable representing the positive or negative status of each fecal specimen. Similarly, the dependent variable used to represent the risk of diarrhea was the diarrheic or nondiarrheic status of individual fecal specimens, with specimens having consistency scores of 3 or 4 classified as diarrheic. The intra-class correlation of C. parvum shedding was estimated using a one-way analysis of variance approach with the 'loneway' command in Stata 9.0.

As in univariable modelling, C. parvum shedding status, and diarrhea status of calves at individual weekly sampling times, were used as response variables in modelling risk of shedding and risk of diarrhea, respectively. Where variables were not mutually exclusive and were highly correlated, only one of the related variables was included in model-building, the decision of which to include being made on the basis of distribution and biological plausibility. Models were built by the manual backwards elimination procedure described by Dohoo et al. (2003) with a significance level of P > 0.05 as the criterion for removal of a variable from the model. The statistical significance of continuous and dichotomous variables in each model was assessed using Wald's test, and the likelihood ratio test was used to determine the significance of multilevel categorical predictors. The associations between continuous variables and the outcome were assessed for linearity both graphically, and by the inclusion of polynomial terms in the model; variables were assumed to have an approximately linear relationship with the outcome if the coefficients of the polynomial terms were non-significant at the 5% level. Non-linear associations were modelled by categorizing the variable before inclusion in the models. During the model-building process, whether or not a predictor was a confounder was determined by removing the variable and observing the effect on the coefficients of the remaining significant variables; a change of more than 25% in one or more coefficients was regarded as evidence of confounding (Dohoo et al., 2003) . Interaction was assessed by the generation of interaction terms amongst variables in the final first-order model and the inclusion of those terms along with the main effects. A P-value of less than 0.05 associated with an interaction term was considered evidence of interaction.",

Probable reasons for this apparent discrepancy include the fact that 4 weekly samples were taken from each animal instead of the single sample used in most other studies. Furthermore, farms were selected based on the criterion of a previous history of calf diarrhea. In addition, calves in our study were all under 1 month of age, and were therefore within the age group known to show the highest prevalence of C. parvum infection and diarrhea. Moreover, of the 1045 calves enrolled in this study, 584 were from a single large herd with a high prevalence of C. parvum shedding (91%) and diarrhea (79%); the overall prevalence of C. parvum shedding on the other 10 farms was 62%.",

The quantity of colostrum fed to calves in the first 24 h after birth was also positively associated with the risk of C. parvum shedding. On the other hand, calves that received feed containing coccidiostats, and those born to dams that had been treated with calf-scour prophylactic medications (ScourGuard [Novartis, Ontario] or Ecostar [Pfizer, Ontario]) were significantly less likely to shed C. parvum. Those born in multicow calving pens also showed a slightly lower risk of shedding, though this variable appeared to be a confounder and was not significantly associated with shedding at the 5% level (P = 0.800). In a previous study, Frank and Kaneene (1993) found that the use of individual maternity stalls was significantly associated with an increased incidence of calf diarrhea in dairy herds with more than 200 cows in Michigan, USA. As is often the case with predictors found to be significantly associated with a response variable in a statistical model, the associations observed in our study may not reflect actual causal or protective relationships. Instead, the predictors included in the model may merely be indicators of other unknown management factors that are directly related to the risk of C. parvum infection and shedding in calves. For example, the negative association between use of calf-scour prophylactic medications in pregnant cows and the risk of shedding may reflect the impact of a generally higher standard of herd management in some herds on the risk of shedding, rather than a direct protective effect, as neither of the medications used is known to provide any protection against C. parvum in calves. Further, it is often difficult to distinguish between calf-and herd-level exposure factors. Indeed, the small number of herds used in this study increases the likelihood that the observed associations may be reflections of individual herd effects instead of true causal associations. Having said that, we believe that our findings will add to the current knowledge of potential risk factors for C. parvum shedding and diarrhea.",

It appears, therefore, that C. parvum was the enteropathogen most strongly associated with diarrhea, as well as, perhaps, the most common cause of calf diarrhea, within our study population. The low predicted probabilities of diarrhea in C. parvum negative calves (Fig. 2) , computed from coefficients of the model in Table 4 , highlight the importance of the parasite as a cause of scouring, since the overall prevalence of diarrhea in the calves was much higher than the predicted probabilities of scouring in non-shedding calves shown in the graph.",

As the risk of C. parvum shedding was significantly higher in the summer months, it follows that the risk of C. parvumassociated diarrhea would also be higher in these calves at that time of the year. It is possible that the cases of diarrhea observed in the calves used in previous studies (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986; Curtis et al., 1988; Frank and Kaneene, 1993) were predominantly caused by enteropathogens other than C. parvum. Furthermore, the fact that the farms used in our study were selected based on a history of calf diarrhea or cryptosporidiosis may have contributed to some of the differences between the findings reported here and those of other researchers. The length of time for which calves remained with their dams after birth was significantly associated with diarrhea; the odds of diarrhea in calves remaining with their mothers for more than 1 h were 39% higher than the odds of diarrhea in those separated from the dam within an hour of birth (Table 4 ). Using an experimental approach, Quigley et al. (1994) found that, in a study population of 96 Jersey calves, the prevalence of Cryptosporidium was significantly higher in calves 1 week of age that had been allowed to nurse their dams, than in calves of the same age that had been separated from their dams before they could nurse, and fed colostrum by bottle. However, in our study, no statistically significant association was observed between the risk of shedding and length of time with the dam, either in univariable or in multivariable analysis. The reason for the apparent association between length of stay with dam and the risk of diarrhea in our study may therefore be related to factors other than infection with C. parvum.",

Alternatively, other unknown and unmeasured factors that predisposed C. parvum-infected animals to the development of diarrhea may have been more prevalent in the warmer months of the year, either directly or indirectly because of seasonal conditions. Not surprisingly, among the C. parvumpositive calves, the odds of diarrhea in animals shedding more than 2.2 \u00c2 10 5 oocysts per gram of feces were more than six times the odds in calves shedding fewer than 2.2 \u00c2 10 5 oocysts per gram of feces.

            "text": "Odds ratio (or regression coefficient) a 95% Confidence interval a P Generally, associations reported here between predictor variables and C. parvum oocyst shedding or diarrhea, though in many instances biologically plausible as discussed above, should be interpreted with caution. This would be prudent especially because this is the first published study of its kind conducted in Ontario, and because a large number of potential risk factors were investigated, increasing the likelihood of identifying spurious relationships between variables. Predictors that were significant only at the 25% level but not at the 5% level are particularly likely to be variables that have no true causal association with the outcomes. In addition, many of the variables investigated in this study showed little variation among calves within herds, that is, they were essentially herd-level variables. In view of the fact that only 11 purposively selected farms were used in the study, these variables were therefore less suitable for the identification of calf-level risk factors than the 'true' calf-level variables. As mentioned previously, most of the variation in the risk of infection was between herds, as opposed to within herds. With this in mind, and since many management factors were common to most calves within farms, a separate study specifically designed for the investigation of herd-level factors, and including herds with and without histories of calf diarrhea and cryptosporidiosis, would more effectively disclose any associations that may exist between such factors and the outcomes.",

In addition, the parasite appears to be a primary cause of diarrhea among calves under 1 month of age group in the herds used in this study. The work described here has identified some calf-level, as well as a few herd-level, management practices that are potential predictors of the risk of C. parvum shedding and diarrhea among dairy calves in herds experiencing calf diarrhea problems. Further investigation of management practices identified here as predictors of C. parvum shedding and diarrhea in Ontario is warranted, and may be of benefit to producers and practitioners involved in the control of this parasite.",
