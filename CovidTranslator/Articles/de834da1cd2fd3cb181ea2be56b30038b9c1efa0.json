Cleanliness is the key to lessening hospital-borne infection with these agents, most of which are inactivated with detergent or steam cleaning. Litterpans and dishes should be cleaned thoroughly with detergent and scalding water. 3. What types of vaccines are currently available? Attenuated (modified-live) vaccines generally have low antigen mass and almost never induce local reactions; they can be given locally (e.g., modified-live B. bronchiseptica intranasal vaccine) or parenterally (e.g., modified-live panleukopenia). However,living vaccines must replicate in the host to stimulate an effective immune response.",

In general, noninfectious vaccines require higher antigen mass than modified-live vaccines to stimulate immune responses because they do not replicate in the host. Noninfectious vaccines stimulate immune responses of lesser magnitude and shorter duration than attenuated vaccines, unless adjuvants are added. Adjuvants improve immune responses by stimulating uptake of antigens by macrophages, which present the antigens to lymphocytes. Adjuvants can cause or potentiate adverse vaccine reactions; induction of vaccine-associated sarcomas in cats may be one example (see Chapter 82). Most adjuvanted vaccines studied in cats have led to pyogranulornatous reactions that may undergo malignant transformation to soft tissue sarcomas. Subunit vaccines may be superior to killed vaccines that use the entire organism because only the immunogenic parts of the organism are used; thus the potential for vaccine reactions is decreased.",

The DNA that codes for the immunogenic components of the infectious agent is inserted into the genome of a nonpathogenic organism (vector) that replicates in the vaccinated species. As the vector repli-cates in the host, it expresses the immunogenic components of the infectious agent, resulting in induction of specific immune responses. Because the vector vaccine is live and replicates in the host, adjuvants and high-antigen mass are not required, and because only DNA from the infectious agent is incorporated into the vaccine, there is no risk of reverting to the virulent parent strain, as occasionally occurs with attenuated vaccines. Only vectors that do not induce disease in the vaccinate are used. 4 . Does the duration of immunity conferred by a vaccine vary?",
