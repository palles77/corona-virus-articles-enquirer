This paper reviews the methods used in predicting, designing, and analyzing air distributions in the cabins, among which experimental measurements and numerical simulations are the two popular ones. The experimental measurements have usually been seen as more reliable although they are more expensive and time consuming. Most of the numerical simulations use Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) that can provide effectively detailed information. Numerous applications using the two methods can be found in the literature for studying air distributions in aircraft cabins, including investigations on more reliable and accurate models. The review in the paper shows that the studies using both experimental measurements and computer simulations are becoming popular. And it is necessary to use a full-scale test rig to obtain reliable and high quality experimental data. What's more, the hybrid CFD models are found to be rather promising for simulating air distributions in airliner cabins.",

It has been reported that international air travel could have the potential risks associated with airborne disease transmission [3, 4] and about 2.5% overseas travelers requested medical attentions for all sorts of health related problems during the flights [5] . Olsen et al. [6] have reported that 22 passengers among the 120 passengers on a flight from Hong Kong to Beijing were infected with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003.

Furthermore, the air distributions in airliner cabins may be of unsteady state, low speed, high turbulence without knowing pulse frequency.

Nevertheless, such information tends to be sparse in the public literature. One possible reason is that aircraft manufacturers' are unwilling to share publicly the proprietary details of their designs. Since the comfort and safety of aircraft cabins are a matter of public interest and discussion, the related research by non-aircraft manufacturers has substantially increased during the last decade. The objective of this study is to provide an open database from carefully designed experiments for all researchers concerned working on cabin environment issues. To identify the state-of-the-art methods forms the basis of the investigation reported in this paper.",

Experimental studies are usually thought to be more reliable but they are often very expensive and time consuming, so measurements are mainly used to provide data for validating numerical simulations [7, 8] . Moreover, as some characteristics of the airflow in aircraft cabins are unknown, it is hard to identify a proper instrument or measuring method to study it. A validated numerical tool can then be used to analyze many scenarios for achieving the best design at a low cost. As most numerical models apply to a particular fluid feature, a model suitable for studying air distributions in aircraft cabins has not been found. This paper will discuss the two methods used in recent studies of air distributions in aircraft cabins. Table 1 shows a summary of the experimental studies on air distributions in airliner cabins published in the past two decades. The literature shows that the experimental equipment used to measure air distributions can be divided into three types according to their measuring principles. Hotwire anemometers and hotsphere anemometers are based on heat transfer principles; particle tracking velocimetry (PTV), particle streak velocimetry (PSV), particle image velocimetry (PIV), on optical principles; and ultrasonic anemometry (UA), on acoustics principles. This section will discuss these velocimetries in turn.",

A higher air velocity can cool down a heated sensor so the air velocity can be determined from the sensor temperature. The hotwire and hot-sphere anemometers are respectively shown in Fig. 1 . As its name implies, a hotwire anemometer measures the velocity with a heated wire which is sensitive to the velocity direction. Thus, some hotwire anemometers can also measure airflow directions. However, a hot-sphere anemometer measures the omni-directional velocity magnitude, not the direction. Normally, the measuring range is 0.2 w 20 m/s for a hotwire anemometer and 0.05 w 5 m/s for a hot-sphere anemometer; the related accuracies are AE1% w AE3% and AE1% w AE5%, respectively.

They used hotwire anemometers to measure the velocity distributions without flow directions. Zhang et al. [10] used hot-sphere anemometers to obtain the boundary conditions from the diffusers in a full-scale, twin-aisle section of an aircraft cabin mockup. As the size of the diffuser was small and the inlet air velocity was relatively high, it was very difficult to obtain accurate flow information. Since the hot-sphere anemometers did not measure the flow direction, they estimated the flow direction by using smoke visualization, which could not provide highly accurate results. Recently, we applied the hot-sphere anemometers to measure the velocity magnitude on the diffusers of an MD-82 aircraft and found that the velocities varied greatly along the diffusers (Fig. 2) .

This technique seeds air with tracer particles, and then obtains the motion of these particles through the laser sheet by a digital camera.

The large volume of airspace and the obstruction from the manikins also prevented them from acquiring detailed airflow data. The insufficient spatial resolution and the lack of velocity data near the boundaries prevented them from gaining a deeper understanding of the flow dynamics.",

This effort opened the door to quantitative measurements of large volume, low-speed flows, which were difficult to measure by other flow measurement techniques. Wang et al. [20] and Yan et al.

As PIV determines velocity through the movement of a group of particles seeded into the flow, it can be regarded as a high particle concentration mode of PSV. PIV can provide high spatial resolution of the velocity data and can measure instantaneous flow fields [22] . During the measurements, it is necessary to clear the optical paths needed for the PIV system. Thus, the geometry that can be measured is often restricted. For example, Mo et al. [8] performed airflow measurements in a cabin and lowered all the seat backs except those next to the windows so that the laser beam could penetrate the space. This made the cabin being studied much different from reality, although velocimetry could accurately measure the air distributions. Bosbach et al. [23] , G\u00fcnther et al. [24] and Lin et al. [25] also used a PIV system to measure the airflow in an empty cabin mockup, which was quite different from the practical in-flight situation. Zhang et al. [17] and K\u00fchn et al. [26] applied a PIV system to measure the airflow patterns in a cabin in occupied situations, but the PIV measurement could only reach the upper part of the cabin as the seats and manikins significantly blocked the light for showing the airflow paths. Their measurements encountered the same problem as Mo et al. did. However, the study did demonstrate that the configuration of the air supply inlets and rising thermal plumes from the passengers had a large impact on the flow field inside an aircraft cabin.",

Compared to experimental studies, numerical studies of airflows in an aircraft cabin are less expensive and more efficient. The numerical simulations determine the airflow and contaminant transport in the spaces by solving a set of equations modeling the flow, energy, and contaminants. Almost all numerical models approximate and simplify the real airflow. Considerable efforts are still being made to seek more reliable and accurate models. There have been many numerical studies in the past decades. Depending on the extent of approximations, simplifications, and applications, the numerical models can be classified as zonal models and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models [38] .",

By dividing an enclosed space into sub-zones, the zonal model solves the conservation equations of mass, energy, and contaminants and calculates the flow rate between sub-zones by simple correlations for flow and pressure [39] or for flow and temperature [40] . A zonal model requires prior knowledge of the flow pattern. The division of a domain has strong influence over the modeling result. Since an experienced user can obtain accurate results [41] , the zonal model has a considerable number of applications. Olander and Westlin [42] used a zonal model to calculate airflow and contaminant concentration in an aircraft cabin. The box model is quite similar to the zonal model since it is assumed to be completely mixed in each box. The zonal or box model could give a rough estimate of the air distribution since it calculates only the macroscopic flow between zones. Ko et al. [43] used a sequential box model to estimate the concentration of tuberculosis in each box zone. Both the box and zonal models are, in principle, lumped methods. Their objective was to model the airflow as a simplified flow network; the governing equations are linear. However, the use of a zonal model is not as easy as one may think, especially if one has to handle special cells. By comparing zonal models with very coarse-grid CFD simulations, the zonal models do not show much superiority in reducing computing time. In many cases, the overhead time in preparing the data input for a zonal model may be longer than that for a CFD simulation.",

Due to the difficulties in measuring accurate flow boundary conditions from the air supply diffusers, it is impossible to identify the reason for the discrepancies.

The combined use of the two methods has permitted achieving a reliable understanding of cabin flow fields in a time-and cost-effective manner and this use combines the advantages of the two methods.",

Hotwire and hot-sphere anemometers, Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV), Particle Streak Velocimetry (PSV), Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), and Ultrasonic Anemometry (UA) have been used to measure the airflow field. The hotwire and hot-sphere anemometers provide point-by-point data and have great uncertainties when the air velocity is low. Hotwire anemometers cannot easily be used to measure airflow direction, nor can they measure flow direction. The PTV, PSV, and PIV give mainly two-dimensional flow fields. When they were used in an airliner cabin with passengers and seats, the laser light sheet was blocked so it could not be used in the area. The UA can give three-dimensional, point-by-point airflow information. However, its sensor was too bulky for small areas, such as for measuring the airflow from an air diffuser.",

Thus, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has become most popular for studying air distributions in airliner cabins. The RNG k-3 model is more popular than the standard k-3 model and other Reynolds-Averaged NaviereStokes equation (RANS) models. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) can provide more accurate and detailed flow information but requires a two-order magnitude of computing time. The hybrid LES/RANS model or Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) model is less computationally demanding and seems promising.",
