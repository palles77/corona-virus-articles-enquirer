Their biology, physiology, and anatomy are unlike those of any other reptiles. However, some species have suffered the effects of a changing environment and human encroachment; this situation has led to the formation of international programs dedicated to the preservation of threatened or near-extinct species. Of the 23 species of crocodilians, 13 can be found on the red list of endangered species. 1 Taxonomic identifi cation varies among all species, and there is debate over the proper classifi cation of species and subspecies (Tables 6-1 and 6-2; Box 6-1). In addition to having wild crocodilian populations, countries such as Australia, India, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, and the United States maintain intensive production operations for various species.",

In farming operations, breeding pairs of alligators were kept in enclosed areas where they could mate and nest (Figure 6 -1). The eggs were collected from the nests and incubated. The farming operations led to ranching operations in which eggs are harvested from the wild and incubated in private facilities ( Figure 6 -2). The alligators hatched on an \"alligator ranch\" are then raised for their hide and meat. To help maintain the wild populations, 14% of the hatched alligators are eventually returned to the wild. Louisiana is the primary producer of American alligators in the world. Captive rearing operations can also be found in Florida, Texas, Georgia, and other southern states within the United States where alligators naturally inhabit. In Louisiana the majority of the operations are ranches, whereas many farms still exist in Florida. Other crocodilian species, such as the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus), are primarily raised under farming operations in other countries.",

There are many reasons why crocodilian species should not be maintained as pets. In addition to the physical dangers and risks associated with keeping crocodilians, there is the misfortune of inadequate husbandry, adversely affecting the reptile's health. Most crocodilians grow to be larger than other reptile species and therefore have signifi cant space requirements. Like most animals requiring an aquatic environment, crocodilians need water that is clean and free of disease. Another husbandry issue is an incorrect diet, which can lead to metabolic abnormalities and overall poor health. Many private owners are unable or unwilling to provide these conditions for their crocodilians. In addition to these issues, most states will require special permits to own these animals. Most people lack the proper ownership permits, and veterinarians could be liable if they treat these illegal patients. The biggest challenge that veterinarians face when treating illegally owned animals is that they are often the last chance for humane treatment for these animals. It is the duty of Most of the material presented in this chapter specifi cally relates to the American alligator (A. mississippiensis). Although most of the alligator information will apply to other crocodilian species, there are variations among groups that will be mentioned. The natural environment and geographic distribution of a species will often determine disease exposure. Once in captivity, all species are susceptible to the same diseases within that environment. In addition, there are some inherent differences among the three families of crocodilians-Alligatoridae, Crocodylidae, and Gavialidae-that have emerged from studying them in captivity.",

            "text": "One of the most common questions a veterinarian may encounter regarding reptiles is \"What is the difference between alligators and crocodiles?\" The fi rst difference is that they belong to two different families: the family Alligatoridae (see Table 6 -1) includes the alligators and caimans, and the family Crocodylidae (see Table 6 -2) includes all crocodiles. There is a third family, the Gavialidae (see Box 6-1), which contains the gharial, or gavial. Geographic location may help in the identifi cation of some species. Alligators are thought to tolerate colder temperatures and live at higher latitudes, whereas crocodiles and caimans are less cold resistant and live in warmer areas. 2 However, there are some anatomic features that will be most useful in differentiating alligators from crocodiles. The alligators and caimans have a broad, u-shaped snout, whereas crocodiles have a more narrow, v-shaped snout. This difference can be observed by looking at the dorsal aspect of the head (Figure 6-3) . A more obvious distinction can be made when looking at their mouth from the side (Figure 6-4) . Alligators and caimans have notches in the maxilla that fi t the mandibular teeth. Therefore, they have no mandibular teeth visible if observed from the side with their mouth closed. On the other hand, crocodiles have the fourth mandibular tooth exposed when looking at them from the side with their mouth closed. Integumentary sensing organs, also known as dome pressure receptors (DPRs), are clear to gray pits present on the skin of crocodilians. Their function is not completely understood, but they may play a role as mechanoreceptors in prey detection or even as chemoreceptors aiding in detection of salinity levels. 3, 4 Alligators and caimans have DPRs only on the lateral aspect of the mandible ( Figure 6 -5), whereas crocodiles and gharials have DPRs all over the body, most noticeably on the ventral scales ( Figure 6-6) . The presence of DPRs can be used to differentiate the two main groups of crocodilian skins in the leather market. An additional feature that could be used for differentiation of alligators and crocodiles is the salt glands, which are absent from the tongue of alligators and caimans but well developed in crocodiles and gharials.",

Crocodilians have a four-chambered heart as opposed to the three-chambered heart found in other reptiles and amphibians. The circulation of blood through the crocodilian heart is like that in the heart of mammals, but the crocodilians possess a viable foramen of Panizza. This opening is located at the base of the heart between the left and right aortic arches and allows for venous admixture, which is essential during periods of diving to conserve oxygen. 5 During diving, there is pulmonary hypertension. This in turn creates increased pressure in the pulmonary artery and the right ventricle, which forces deoxygenated blood through the foramen of Panizza into the left side of the heart and the aorta to be distributed through the body. This mechanism allows for conservation of oxygen and supplies oxygenated blood to those organs that require it the most, allowing some crocodilian species to stay submerged for up to 6 hours. 6 A second anastomosis may be present in other crocodilian species as a vessel connecting the two aortic arches. 2 Submandibular (Figure 6 -8) and paracloacal glands and a gall bladder are present in crocodilians. The hard dorsal scales are known as osteoderms, bony plates lined by skin. Crocodilians have a smaller gastric compartment distal to the stomach that is a gizzard-like structure in which rocks and other materials may be found. It does not appear as evolved as the ventriculus in birds, however. Crocodilian intestines have a thick wall and can have well-developed diffuse aggregates of lymphoid tissues like Peyer's patches. There is no urinary bladder, but the colon can hold large amounts of urine and water. Sexing can be performed by palpation of the cloaca; males have a phallus that can be palpated and extracted from the cloaca. Females have a well-developed clitoris that, depending on size, can be confused with a phallus. Internally paired gonads are found near the ventral surface of the kidneys.",

This is not the case in many commercial operations, where they are maintained at a fairly constant temperature and humidity to achieve faster growth.

Ultraviolet light is essential for the synthesis of vitamin D 3 , specifi cally its active form 1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D, which is essential for the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus. A lack of vitamin D 3 can lead to inappropriate calcium absorption, which in turn creates a metabolic imbalance resulting in metabolic bone disease. Metabolic bone disease, specifi cally secondary nutritional hyperparathyroidism, is recognized in many reptile species housed with an inappropriate source of UVB light, fed a diet defi cient in calcium, or both. Carnivorous reptiles may also benefi t from UVB light but are thought to obtain enough vitamin D 3 and calcium from their prey. The UVB light requirement of crocodilians is unknown, but as true carnivores they may thrive with minimal exposure to UVB light. It is a common practice on alligator ranches to raise animals in darkness with no source of UVB light or a normal light cycle. Most animals will grow well under these conditions, and some have reached adulthood without signs of metabolic diseases. However, I have also observed evidence of metabolic bone disease in a subset of captive American alligators being fed a commercial diet with no exposure to UVB light. In these cases veterinarians must also consider the possibility that the commercial diet may be defi cient in calcium. Anecdotal stories from alligator ranches claim that weak, anorectic animals appear to improve after being exposed to sunlight over a period of time. Further research is needed to determine the UVB light requirements of crocodilians and the potential benefi ts of exposure to UVB light.

Their feeding habits in the wild will vary with age and food availability. Early on, their diet will consist of small invertebrates, amphibians, and reptiles. As they grow, they will eat larger prey of the type described earlier and will incorporate fi sh and birds into their dietary regime. With time, and depending on the species, size, and food availability, crocodilians will start eating mammals. There have been few studies investigating the nutritional requirements and feeding protocols of alligators. [8] [9] [10] Various commercial feeds are available for alligators maintained in captivity. The commercial rations consist of dry pelleted diets that try to provide full nutritional requirements. These diets can be found with a 45%, 47%, or 56% protein content, less than 11% fat, and approximately 3% fi ber content. 11 Refi ned commercial alligator diets are widely used in production operations but may prove too expensive and/or inappropriate for the long term. A variety of whole prey feeds, such as chicken, nutria, and fi sh, are also recommended. If using nutria, be sure that it has not been killed using lead shot; if the lead is ingested, toxicosis can occur. 12 When feeding frozen fi sh to crocodilians, provide a vitamin B supplement or another meat source to prevent thiamine defi ciency. To prevent dietary associated problems, purchase meat from a reputable source.",

Although alligators and caimans are usually thought of as being less aggressive than crocodiles, this may not always be true. All sizes and species should be handled with the safety of the people as well as the animal in mind. Crocodilians less than 1 m in length (snout to tip of tail) may be handled by one or two individuals. Those between 1 and 2 m in length should be handled by at least two or three indi-viduals. Those longer than 2 m in length will require at least four to fi ve individuals. Various tools (e.g., pole snares, nets, squeeze cages, traps) also can be used to restrain crocodilians. The head, tail, and limbs must be immobilized and controlled. Once the animal is under control, the mouth is secured with strong tape or a rope.

It is also common to fi nd tooth marks, scratches, and lacerations on the ventral epithelial surface. Finally, examine the vent and cloaca for abnormalities. If working in a commercial operation, a veterinarian must examine multiple animals to determine if an observation is associated with disease.

There are no specifi c tests available to provide a clinical measure of stress. Veterinarians concentrate on identifying a combination of physiologic changes that give them an idea of what is involved in a stress response. The stress response in crocodilians has been examined in relation to restraint, long-term corticosterone implants, cold shock, and stocking densities. 15,17-20 Lance et al. provides an overview of the physiology and endocrinology of stress in crocodilians. 21 Catecholamines, glucocorticoids, glucose, and lactate have been implicated in the stress response of crocodilians. Changes in the white blood cells have also been implicated with immunosuppression and the stress response.

All of the buildings with affected animals had PVC pipes on the inside walls that delivered water to each individual pen. A strong water stream fell from the pipes down into the water and the strength of the stream decreased from one end of the building (infl ow) to the other end (outfl ow). The strength of the water stream was considerable near the infl ow. The building with no affected animals did not have any source of falling water into the pens. Water quality, temperature, and feed were the same in affected and nonaffected buildings. The most affected animals happened to be in the pens at the infl ow side of the building with the number of affected animals decreasing toward the outfl ow side of the building. This constant fl ow of water was creating a constant movement of the water surface and consequently stimulating the alligators via the DPRs. Once this watering system was changed, the cases of dermatitis decreased and no new cases were reported. Although other factors, such as water quality, may have contributed to the dermatitis, the change in the watering system decreased the progression and occurrence of the disease. This case demonstrates the importance of addressing the environment, as well as the animals, when working in commercial operations.",

            "text": "Bacterial diseases in captive crocodilians occur primarily as opportunistic infections. Poor water quality, trauma, and stress are some of the factors that contribute to bacterial infections in crocodilians. In their natural environment, crocodilians appear to have a stronger ability, compared with other species, to withstand bacterial infections. Reports of antibacterial properties in serum and tissues of crocodilians 22,23 offer a possible explanation. The possibility of increased antibacterial properties in the serum and tissues of alligators should not mislead people into thinking that crocodilians are resistant to bacterial infections. It is true that they appear to tolerate trauma and other lesions that would be fatal in many species, but crocodilians are still capable of succumbing to an array of microorganisms, including bacteria. In fact, a number of bacterial infections have been reported in crocodilians, and septicemias are thought to be a frequent fi nding. Septicemias can be diagnosed in postmortem examinations and are often associated with a wide number of bacteria, many of them normal gut fl ora. There is an abundance of information about bacteria recovered from the American alligator (A. mississippiensis) [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] (Table 6 -3) and from African dwarf crocodiles (Osteolaemus tetraspis). 40 ",

This delay has occurred primarily because of diffi culties in developing diagnostic tests and lack of knowledge of viruses that affect reptiles and crocodilians. Many conditions that go undiagnosed may be caused by viruses. These may be new viruses or just viral diseases unknown to occur in reptilian or crocodilian species. There are only a few recognized viruses that have been documented in crocodilians. Jacobson et al. 33 described an adenovirus-like infection in captive Nile crocodiles (C. niloticus) characterized by nonspecifi c clinical signs, lethargy, and anorexia. Conjunctivitis and blepharitis were also observed in one of two crocodiles. 2, 33 Histopathologic examination revealed intranuclear inclusions, primarily in the liver but also in the intestines, pancreas, and lung. Both horizontal and vertical transmission have been postulated for this adenovirus-like infection. 2 Diagnosis is obtained through postmortem examination, and no treatment regimes have been established.",

There is also the possibility of infection after ingestion of an animal with a high viral load of WNV, as reported by Klenk et al. 71 This last scenario is more likely to occur when crocodilians are housed outdoors and not in enclosed buildings, as in most ranching operations. It has been demonstrated that alligators can serve as amplifi ers of WNV. 71 Although there is a lot to be learned about WNV in croco dilians, it is believed that once infected, they can develop high viremias and shed the virus in the feces. Fecal shedding leads to horizontal transmission of the virus. There is clinical evidence for horizontal transmission to occur in commercial operations. Fecal shedding and high viremias also raise the concern of zoonosis, especially in commercial operations where animals are being slaughtered and people come in contact with blood and tissues. A strict building quarantine and hygiene strategies should be implemented to prevent the spread of WNV to other animals in the facility as well as to the personnel. In the state of Louisiana there are a number of recommendations provided to help alligator producers cope with episodes of WNV and prevent spread of the disease (Box 6-2).",

However, sporadic mortalities may also be noted, especially in older animals. Clinical signs of WNV in alligators include swimming in circles, head tilt, muscle tremors, weakness, lethargy, and anorexia. 72 Bloating and diffi culties swimming have also been observed but occur less commonly. 72 Gross fi ndings from WNV-infected alligators are nonspecifi c. Light microscopy of tissues from infected animals may reveal diffuse severe heterophilic, histiocytic, and necrotizing enterocolitis; heterophilic meningoencephalitis; necrotizing and heterophilic hepatitis; heterophilic and histiocytic splenitis; generalized heterophilic and histiocytic lymphoid folliculitis; and necrotizing and heterophilic pancreatitis. Veterinarians may also observe a mild multifocal heterophilic and lymphohistiocytic interstitial nephritis, gastritis, and mild pulmonary congestion and edema. Strong immunopositivity results have been observed in the brain, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract after immunohistochemistry testing for WNV. Proliferative enteritis has been diagnosed in a group of alligators positive for WNV. The colon lesions tested positive for WNV via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), culture, and immunohistochemistry 59, 72 ( Figure 6-15 ). These affected alligators were bloated and unable to submerge themselves; these symptoms may have been due to a blockage caused by the fi brinous membrane in the colon.",

Once WNV is present within an operation, it is critical to maintain infected and exposed animals in strict isolation. The ill and exposed animals must not be moved to other areas or buildings where WNV has not been observed. Failure to maintain strict isolation may result in the spread of the virus throughout the facility. In addition, there should be strict biosecurity measures, especially in the affected areas or buildings. Tools such as nets, feeding utensils, boots, and so forth, must be left in the affected area and not introduced to other, \"clean\" areas or buildings. The surviving animals will continue to thrive after the WNV infection has run its course, but it is unknown for how long thereafter they can shed the virus. Antibody titers of 1 : 640 and 1 : 320 were observed in two alligators 14 months after exposure to WNV. These antibody titer results were obtained via a plaque reduction neutralization test. Defi nitive diagnosis of WNV infection should be based on history, clinical signs, and the results of diagnostic tests. Postmortem diagnosis can be performed via RT-PCR and/or viral culture of brain, spinal cord, or liver, with immunohistochemistry providing additional supportive evidence of WNV infection. Immunohistochemistry may prove useful as an antemortem test when applied to biopsies of the colon mucosa.",

            "text": "Fungal infections also occur with some frequency in captive crocodilians. Most fungi are opportunistic invaders of the integument, respiratory system, and gastrointestinal tract. Poor water quality, trauma, stress, and extreme temperatures can contribute to the occurrence of fungal disease. It is thought that most fungal infections in crocodilians are of enteric origin and occur in other tissues secondary to an immunocompromised state. 2 It is important to remember that fungi are considered ubiquitous organisms in nature. Therefore, it is not uncommon to isolate fungi from tissues (e.g., skin, intestines) that are in contact with water and soil. The presence of fungi will vary with geographic location and management techniques that affect the different environments for their growth. There are a number of fungi that have been isolated from crocodilians 2, 40, 51, [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] (Table 6 -4). Some of these fungal organisms were associated with disease, whereas others were incidental fi ndings. Diagnosis of fungal disease requires the identifi cation of a fungal organism via culture or special stains of infected tissues. Positive identifi cation of genus and species may be diffi cult. Treatment is expensive and may be affordable only when administering to a small number of animals. It also requires a long treatment period of at least 2 or 3 months. For these reasons, many fungal infections go untreated, and recommendations are made for prevention of disease.",

However, there are a number of areas in a crocodilian's body that have soft skin and allow an external parasite to attach and/or obtain a meal. The recent cases of WNV in the American alligator (A. mississippiensis) are a reminder that arthropods can play an important role in disease transmission. Internal parasites are not a common problem in ranching operations where animals are maintained in concrete buildings with no organic substrate. Parasites are of major concern in wild crocodilians or those kept captive outdoors on organic substrates. External parasites are more ubiquitous, affecting both captive and wild populations. To determine the best prevention and control methods to use, veterinarians must assess the environment as well as the life cycle of the parasite.",

            "text": "With the increased knowledge of crocodilian dietary requirements, nutritional diseases are diagnosed less frequently than they were in the past. Better understanding of the biology, natural history, and physiology of the different crocodilian species has allowed implementation of better feeding schemes and diets. Over time, there has been a desire to develop commercial diets that will allow for high feed to weight gain ratios. These commercial diets are available for feeding American alligators (A. mississippiensis), and although the diets are not perfect, if fed appropriately, captive-hatched American alligators (A. mississippiensis) will grow up to 36 inches in length within a 12-month period. For zoologic institutions the goal is not rapid growth but rather normal development and a foundation for excellent health. Zoologic institutions and crocodile farms commonly provide crocodilians with fresh and/or frozen prey (e.g., poultry, swine, beef, fi sh, nutria, native prey, etc.) with bones providing a source of calcium. To prevent lead toxicity in crocodilians, veterinarians must use a reputable fresh or frozen prey source that has not been killed with lead projectiles (e.g., shotgun pellets, bullets). Despite better feeding schemes and diets, veterinarians will still see crocodilians with diseases associated with nutritional defi ciencies. A common nutritional disease of reptiles is metabolic bone disease (MBD). Clinical signs of MBD include weakness, lethargy, kyphosis, scoliosis, osteodystrophy, pathologic fractures, paresis, and tooth decalcifi cation. Various possible causes of MBD have been proposed, but it is usually associated with a calcium-phosphorus imbalance that leads to increased bone resorption. Calcium and vitamin D 3 are the two main nutritional compounds defi cient in reptiles with MBD. Vitamin D 3 defi ciencies are associated with a lack of exposure to UVB spectrum light, which comes naturally from the sun. Light bulbs and light tubes are commercially available to help provide adequate amounts of UVB light for reptiles. MBD is primarily observed in herbivorous or omnivorous reptiles. It appears that MBD is not commonly observed in commercial crocodilian operations, even in those were animals are raised in the dark with no source of UVB light. The carnivorous nature of crocodilians may allow them to obtain vitamin D 3 from the diet without a true requirement for UVB light. However, if an appropriate calcium source is not offered, these animals will develop MBD. Adult alligators without MBD have been observed growing in enclosed buildings with no light source while being fed a commercial diet supplemented with fresh prey meat with bones. However, anecdotal comments from various ranchers indicate that the animals appear to thrive better if exposed to sunlight. This is an area where more research is needed to determine the UVB and calcium requirements of crocodilians and their effects on growth and health. Articular and visceral gout also have been reported in crocodilians. Some predisposing factors for gout include high protein diets, dehydration, and stress. Clinical signs associated with chronic gout in crocodilians are primarily nonspecifi c, but limb paresis or paralysis and joint enlargement can occur. Ariel et al. reported a case of visceral and articular gout with concurrent hypovitaminosis A in crocodile hatchlings. 81 Defi ciencies of vitamins A, B, C, or E also can lead to a variety of musculoskeletal disorders. These are thought to be less common in crocodilians fed commercial diets in addition to fresh meat products.",

The most recent explanation of signs of neurologic disease in crocodilian species is WNV. This virus should be in the differential diagnosis list for any crocodilian that has neurologic signs and is housed in an area where WNV is endemic. Hypoglycemia also has been reported to cause neurologic signs in alligators. 82 Neurologic signs and deaths of alligators (A. mississippiensis) were identifi ed from a commercial operation where a building was not cleaned according to the maintenance schedule. The water in the building had not been changed in a 72-hour period, and there was evidence of food debris from previous feedings. The owner found a few hundred dead alligators, and of those that remained alive, some had neurologic signs (e.g., slow refl exes, abnormal swimming patterns, ataxia, and lethargy). Necropsy and histopathologic evaluation leaned toward toxicity as the cause of death. Both dead and live animals tested negative for WNV. All other buildings were cleaned on schedule, and there was no evidence of disease in those buildings. Mortalities decreased after the building housing the sick animals was cleaned. Based on the history, clinical observations, and histopathologic fi ndings, veterinarians believe these animals developed neurologic signs as a result of either increased ammonia level in the water, oxygen depletion in the air, or both. 59 ",

Water quality, temperature, and stressors contribute to the occurrence of integumentary diseases. Secondary bacterial and fungal dermatitis in crocodilians can have a devastating economic impact on com- mercial operations. Lacerations, abscesses, and draining tracts can serve as a nidus for microorganisms. An additional predisposing factor of integumentary disease in captive operations is the accumulation of fat in the upper water column. This concentration of fat creates a slime layer on the walls and water surface, which is then transferred to the skin of the animals where it creates an ideal environment for fungal and bacterial growth. This is more of a problem when meat is the sole source of food or is provided in addition to a commercial diet. A surfactant disinfectant can be used to break down the fat accumulation in the water and on the walls of the enclosure. In most instances both bacteria and fungi will be present in the skin lesions associated with fat accumulation in the captive environment. It is important to recognize the fat accumulation problem early to institute appropriate cleaning measures and possible therapy. Mixed fl ora is often found in the dermal lesions, making identifi cation of a single causal agent diffi cult. Antimicrobial therapy is indicated if bacterial involvement is suspected. Although the use of systemic antifungal medications is cost prohibitive in commercial operations, it can be used if only a small number of animals are affected. Improved hygiene, better water quality, stable temperatures, and decreased stress are essential for managing these dermatitis cases. In most instances those animals that are already showing clinical signs may not recover.

In a large commercial operation where a higher number of animals may need treatment, it may be time, cost, and labor prohibitive to administer medications intramuscularly or intravenously to individual animals. Spectrum of coverage, method and frequency of administration, and cost should be considered when selecting an antimicrobial agent(s). Consideration should be given to those drugs that can be mixed with, or injected into, the feed. One technique of antibiotic administration is making a sausage fi lled with the animal's feed and placing the drug in the sausage. Manual medication by mouth or injection can be performed in smaller animals. Whenever possible, culture and sensitivity test should be obtained to identify the organism in question and determine the effi cacy of the antimicrobial selected.

When transporting large, aggressive animals, veterinarians might use these agents to prevent injury to both the handlers and the animal. However, these drugs do not have analgesic properties and should not be used alone for any surgical procedures. When using neuromuscular blocking agents, veterinarians should ensure the animal is supported with a backboard to minimize injury to the spine. Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker with primary action at the nerve end plate, and fl accid or rigid paralysis may occur depending on the dose. 5, 93 There is no reversal agent for succinylcholine, so it must be used with caution and the animals monitored closely. Effects can be observed within 5 minutes of administration, and recovery takes up to 1.5 hours. Recovery will depend on the excretion of the drug in the urine and metabolism of the crocodilian. Gallamine is a nondepolarizing neuromuscular agent that competitively blocks acetylcholine at the motor end plate, resulting in fl accid paralysis. Crocodilians immobilized with gallamine will open their mouths following relaxation of the muscles; this is known as the Flaxidil reaction. 5 Increased respiratory rate and heart rate may be observed with gallamine immobilization. 94, 95 An overdose of gallamine may lead to bradycardia, mydriasis, increased gastrointestinal motility, and paralysis of respiratory muscles. 5 Increased salivation and emesis can be prevented with presurgical use of atropine. 95 An advantage of gallamine over succinylcholine is that it can be reversed with neostigmine methylsulfate. Fatalities have been reported in American alligators (A. mississippiensis), Chinese alligators (A. sinensis), and false gharials (Tomistoma schlegelii) that were administered gallamine. 95 Diazepam can also be administered 20 to 30 minutes before succinylcholine or gallamine for added muscle relaxation. 96 Administration and recovery of animals with neuromuscular agents should be done far from the water to avoid drowning. Noise and light stimuli should be minimized when animals have been sedated with gallamine or any other neuromuscular agent or anesthetic. Table 6 -5 shows doses for various neuromuscular agents. Following administration of a neuromuscular agent, it may be possible to intubate a crocodilian for general anesthesia with an inhalant anesthetic such as isofl urane.

Propofol is a lipid soluble drug with fast action and short duration of effects, which makes it an ideal anesthetic agent that allows for intubation of the animal to be followed with inhalant anesthesia. Propofol can be administered at 10 to 15 mg/kg IV 5,14 and as a constant rate infusion. The IV route of administration of propofol presents a disadvantage in cases where manual restraint is not possible or is undesired.",

The most common surgical procedure performed in zoologic institutions is probably the removal of foreign bodies through gastroscopy. This may be performed under immobilization or general anesthesia. Enterotomies are rare but may be required if a foreign body lodges itself beyond the stomach, is too large to pass on its own, or both. The next most common procedure is the repair of fractures and lacerations caused by trauma. Crocodilian fracture repair can present a real challenge to the veterinarian because of an animal's large size, demeanor, and need to live in an aquatic environment. Therefore, it is preferred to perform fracture repairs with internal fi xation methods, such as intramedullary pins, cerclage wire, and bone plates. Before attempting a surgical procedure, any veterinarian must realistically determine the prognosis for the animal.",
