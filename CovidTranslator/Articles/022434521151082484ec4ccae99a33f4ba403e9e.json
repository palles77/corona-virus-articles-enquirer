            "text": "ALMOST 20 years since the discovery of the endogenous opiate peptides, much remains to be learned about their effects on behavior and the mechanisms involved in those actions. Interest in them continues to be great, although the term opioid is no longer used to denote peptides with opiate activity. In 1993, as in previous years, much research about opiate peptides concerned their ability to modulate behavior pharmacologically, although there has been increasing emphasis on their physiological role, especially through their manipulation by the use of opiate antagonists, both endogenous and exogenous. It has become obvious that the opiate system does not work in isolation, but instead is highly interrelated with other systems, including neurotransmitters and hormones, so that the functions of the opiate system are complex and difficult to discover. This paper reviews work published in 1993 that investigated the behavioral and nonanalgesic, except stress-induced analgesic, activity of the endogenous opiate system. It is the sixteenth installment in our series of reviews summarizing the annual developments in the field. There was still much concern over stress-induced behaviors, not only analgesia, but also changes in activity, self-administration of opiates, and vocalizations. There continued to be focus on the variables that affect the opiate or nonopiate nature of the stress-related behavior, as well as attempts to specify which receptor subtypes are responsible for the different reactions. Interest continued to grow in the mechanisms and functions affecting opiate tolerance and dependence, with special attempts to link them with other agents and systems, including dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and nitric oxide. Limited success was achieved in attempts to use antagonists in treatment of addiction.",

Success in linking the opiate system to eating disorders still remained somewhat elusive. There was, however, a growing line of evidence to indicate that the opiate system might be involved in the consumption of alcohol, although its usefulness in treatment of alcoholism has yet to be demonstrated. The role of the opiate system in the regulation of intake of liquids, in general, is less clear, and its effect with ethanol may reflect alteration of reward value rather than of fluid homeostasis. Interest in opiate modulation of gastrointestinal function decreased, with sparse support for previous findings of opiate inhibition of motility. There was, however, an increase in research concerning the role of the opiate system in renal function. Receptor specificity and other variables were crucial in this area, so that no new generalizations were able to be drawn.",

Some symptoms of autism also seem to be modulated by them. The area of opiate mediation of learning and memory drew increased interest this past year, as it had in recent years. The role of the opiates as conditioned stimuli in classical conditioning, especially in conditioned place preference, received much attention, as did their ability to act as discriminative stimuli in operant tasks. The amnestic properties of the agonists and the facilitation of memory by the antagonists also were studied, as was the mechanism that might be involved in opiate reward. Research on the regulation of cardiovascular activity by the opiates decreased t Requests for reprints should be addressed to Gayle A. Olson. 1514 OLSON, OLSON AND KAST1N somewhat in 1993. As in previous years, there were no generalizations that could be drawn about their effects on heart rate or blood pressure, due to conflicting findings. Interest in the involvement of the opiate system in cardiovascular shock also was less that in previous years, and results were still confusing.",

There was a possible relationship between respiratory disorders and endogenous opiates found. Similarly, the # and ~ agonists produced hypothermia is most cases, and the antagonists did the opposite. Interactions between the opiate system and other variables received some focus. There was less interest in opiate modulation of seizures, with research indicating possible proconvulsant action by the # agonists and anticonvulsant effects of the K agonists, although there were exceptions. The role of the opiates in brain injury became more confusing, with conflicting results. There appear to be changes in the opiate system with Alzheimer's disease, but it is still too early to explain much about their relationship to the symptoms.",

Many effects were also receptor specific, whereas others seemed to be modified by almost any agonist. Similarly, although there continued to be large amounts of work done on the opiate mediation of general activity and locomotion, no definitive conclusions were reached, perhaps because of the many ways in which these behaviors are measured and the multiple variables that affect them. There was more promising work on the possible role of the opiates in exercise, however. Little attention was paid to the opiate modulation of sexual behavior, but more was directed to the involvement of the endogenous opiate system in development, prenatally through senescence. There are clear changes that occur both at the behavioral and receptor levels, although the relationship between the two is not always as easily determined.",

Often the opiate or nonopiate nature of the stressors depends on small differences in them (i.e., intermittent vs. continuous foot shock or cold water vs. warm water swims), as well as the behavior being measured (i.e., analgesia or activity). Typically, the opiate nature is determined by the ability of antagonists to block or reverse the effects of the stressor.

Inescapable intermittent shock resulted in analgesia that was reversed by naloxone (55, 339) if the antagonist was administered subcutaneously (SC) or intrathecally (IT), but not intraventricularly (ICV), suggesting that the opiate effect was probably at the spinal cord level (339) . Because naloxone influenced morphine analgesia somewhat differently than it did shock-induced analgesia, requiring lower doses SC and IT and being effective ICV in reversing morphine analgesia, the action was probably not primarily mediated by the # receptors (339) . The selective receptor antagonist naltrindole had no effect on the analgesia, but the selective K antagonist nor-binaltorphimine either intraperitoneally (IP) or IT blocked it, strongly suggesting that spinal K receptors are responsible for this analgesia (339) . Prolonged shock (240 shocks for a total of 20 min) resulted in no analgesia, but the mechanism involved was not clear. The prolonged shock potentiated morphine analgesia, indicating that there was no desensitization of ~z receptors, and although glucocorticoids increased during the shocks, corticosteroid inhibitors did not cause the otherwise ineffective shocks to produce analgesia, indicating that this was not the mechanism for the lack of analgesia (340) . Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), however, may interact with the opiate system in shock-induced analgesia, since an antagonist of CRH blocked the analgesia from intermittent shock but had no effect on the analgesia of continuous shock (55) .",

This finding is opposite that for shock-induced analgesia, which occurs only after inescapable shock, perhaps because the daily running is not a part of the fear response, but analgesia is. Regardless, naltrexone did not alter the suppression of running by shock, indicating that it is probably an opiate effect (550) . Another response to shock is an increase in self-administration of opiates in rats. Lever pressing for access to a fentanyl solution sped up after shock, and when water or quinine (which has a similar taste to fentanyl) was substituted for the agonist, extinction occurred (463) , indicating that opiate actions were involved in the change, with stress-released endogenous opiates potentiating the exogenous one.",

Intermittent, but not chronic, shock increased the concentration of/3-endorphin immunoreactivity in splenocytes, lymph node cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the rise was blocked by a CRH antagonist, suggesting an interaction between the opiate peptide and CRH in mediating the effects of stress on the immune system.

Cold-water swims (193, 269, 387, 425) and swims in water of intermediate (15\u00b0C) or warm (20\u00b0C) temperature (354, 365, 366) produced analgesia under a variety of conditions. Although continuous cold-water swims (CCWS) typically produce nonopiate analgesia, activation of the opiate system by pretreatment with either morphine or naltrexone altered the analgesia, demonstrating that there can be an interaction between opiate and nonopiate systems in nociception (193) . Similarly, although cold-water swims of 30-s duration did not result in analgesia in mice, they did shift the dose-response curve for morphine analgesia to the left (532), thus supporting the lack of independence of the two kinds of analgesia. Intermittent cold-water swims (ICWS) usually produce opiate-mediated analgesia, and this was confirmed by the finding that pretreatment with naltrexone reduced the analgesia (269) . Chronic presentation of CCWSs or ICWS each developed tolerance, and they were tolerant to each other (387) , providing additional evidence of interactions between opiate and nonopiate analgesia mechanisms. Analgesia from swims in 15 \u00b0C water was nonopiate, but in 20\u00b0C water was at least partially opiate (354, 365, 366) , so that the temperature of the water was critical for the underlying mechanism. Short swims resulted in nonopiate analgesia, but longer ones produced opiate antinociception (166) , demonstrating that length of swim was another crucial variable.",

The 6 antagonist ICI 174,864 and the 62 antagonist 5'-isothiocynate had no effect on morphine analgesia but inhibited the leftward shift of the morphine dose-response curve after the swims. The 61 antagonist [D-Ala2,Leu,Cys6]enkephalin had no effect on either measure, suggesting involvement of the 62 receptors in the swim analgesia. The u antagonist/3-funaltrexamine (/3-FNA) inhibited morphine analgesia, and the swims did not affect it, so that ~ receptors were probably not involved in the swim analgesia. Neither Leu-nor Met-enkephalin altered morphine analgesia, and antibodies to Met-enkephalin had no effect on the swim analgesia, but antibodies to Leu-enkephalin inhibited it. These findings indicate that the # receptors may modulate the primary action mediated by the 62 receptors (532). In rats, however, repeated CWSs for 5 days produced analgesia that was increased by naltrexone and reduced by morphine (193) , with the difference possibly being due to species differences or repeated measures, resulting in collateral inhibition of the actions.",

The mechanism responsible for the sex difference was not clear, but it did highlight the need to consider gender a factor in both research and clinical practice with regard to pain (354) . Similarly, breeding males experienced greater swim analgesia than breeding females, but there were no sex differences in nonbreeding mice, so that reproductive status must also be taken into account (166) . Genetic factors are also important, because strains of mice have been selectively bred for high swim analgesia and low swim analgesia (353) . There is also an interaction between the opiate system and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) for CCWS analgesia, because injection of TRH into the posterior periaqueductal gray facilitated the analgesia but into the anterior area reduced it (425) .",

One study reported that swim stress analgesia with warm water was absent up to day l0 in rats, after which time it occurred at a low level and was naloxone reversible. The adult profile was fully developed by day 25 (365) . Another report found weaning status affected the swim analgesia, with naloxone partially reversing the analgesia in 25-day-old rats whether they were weaned or not, but naltrindole reversing it only in weaned animals. At 30 days, naltrindole blocked the analgesia completely, leading to the conclusion that there is a transition from u to 6 receptor control of the response that is affected by weaning (366) . The apparently contradictory finding that swim analgesia in preweanling (20day-old) rats was weak and not naloxone reversible but showed the normal adult naloxone-reversible level in weaned (25-dayold) rats (405) can be reconciled with the other studies in that the former used higher doses of naloxone, which would make it more likely that it would antagonize the opiate effect, and used a different measure of analgesia. They (365, 366) used the tail water immersion test, which is essentially a spinal reflex, but the conflicting study (405) used the tail electrical stimulation test, measuring vocalization afterdischarge threshold, tail withdrawal, and vocalization, which additionally assesses emotional/ affective reactions to pain. Thus, there may be differential nociceptive responses at different levels of neural integration.",

Both a single acute swim or chronic swims raised plasma \u00a2/endorphin, but although the increase from the acute swim was blocked by apomorphine, that produced by chronic swims was not, questioning the role of dopamine in this response. Furthermore, if the dopamine antagonist haloperidol was presented with the chronic swims, there was an increase in POMC mRNA, supporting the nondopaminergic aspect of the reaction (557) . Chronic ICWSs raised ~-endorphin in both plasma and anterior pituitary until the 10th day, at which time there was a decrease in pituitary concentrations, perhaps because of habituation or tolerance. Similarly, the increase in neurointermediate pituitary ~-endorphin in response to a combination of ICWSs and ether disappeared over 10 days of exposure. Administration of acetyl-/-carnitine, a neurotropic drug acting on cholinergic, serotonergic, and GABAergic pathways, blocked the effects of the swims on/3-endorphin (56) , indicating a complex interaction. Further evidence for that idea comes from the report that rats subjected to swims and corticosterone exhibited a transitory increase in \u00a2~-endorphin, but those with swims and saline had a sustained rise in the peptide (9) . There appears to be little doubt that the stress produces a dysfunction of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.",

Support for the idea that at least some of the effects of restraint stress are opiate modulated comes from the report that immobilization resulted in a decrease in ~-endorphin-like immunoreactivity in the periaqueductal gray but not in the pituitary a day later, suggesting it was a central opiate effect (144) . Restraint of a pregnant rat for 5 days during early gestation raised concentrations oft3-endorphin in the hypothalamus of her offspring when tested at postnatal day 10, but longer restraint (15 days) had no effect, indicating that stress during the embryonic period can affect development of the endogenous opiate system, with the amount of change depending on the length of exposure to stress (446) .",

After chronic exposure to immobilization for a short period each day, naloxone inhibited the production of growth hormone, indicating an interactive role for the endogenous opiate system and pituitary-adrenocortical responses (441) . The endogenous opiate system may be involved in stresses associated with fighting or defense. Although defeat has typically been shown to produce nonopiate analgesia, rats exposed to defeat repeatedly exhibited analgesia that was enhanced by naltrexone and that attenuated morphine analgesia ( 193) , indicating a possibly interaction between the opiate and nonopiate mechanisms of analgesia. The effects of aversive encounters was long lasting, because a week after brief exposure to attacks, rats still had reduced sensitivity to morphine analgesia (203). Brief exposure of meadow voles (Microthus pennsylvanicus) to a natural predator, a garter snake, produced nonopiate analgesia that was inhibited by a serotonin agonist, but longer exposure resulted in naloxone-reversible analgesia. The analgesia decreased with age, so the threat presented by the snake decreased (444) .",

This might indicate that the early handling stress produced an upregulation of the opiate system that remained functional, although weakened, for a considerable time. There were sex differences in susceptibility to this stressor, because males were unaffected by neonatal handling alone and females were analgesic. The opiate nature of the analgesia was indicated by its potentiation by morphine in most cases.

The calcium channel agonist BAY K 8644 and antagonists nimodipine and diltiazem reduced the symptoms of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal from morphine, but they did not affect metabolism of serotonin during withdrawal, so that those symptoms, at least, were independent of serotonin (89) .

Chronic morphine increased dopamine concentrations in the nucleus accumbens (258) and in the medulla (499) , and in dependent rats, acute morphine produced a greater increase in dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (258) and a decrease in it in the hypothalamus (345) . Dopamine depletion by a-methyl-p-tyrosine was retarded in the striatum, rest of forebrain, and midbrain in mice removed from repeated morphine treatment (134) , further supporting a role for dopamine in opiate dependence. Withdrawal also caused a decrease in electrically evoked dopamine in the striatum, and this change was long lasting, indicating that it may play a part in the maintenance of dependence (454) . It appears that the D2 receptor is important in dependence, because both the nonselective dopamine agonist apomorphine and the selective D2 agonist propylnorapomorphine reduced withdrawal signs, but the D~ agonist SKF-38393 produced no effect on withdrawal (207). The Dj receptor-stimulated release of cAMP in striatal slices was enhanced in rats treated chronically with morphine and was reduced in those with chronic naltrexone (113) , so that the DI receptor might have an indirect effect on morphine dependence. After chronic U50,488, there was no supersensitization of the D2 receptors, as there was with morphine (534), so that they might not have a role in K receptor dependence.",

Acute DAMGO or chronic morphine released [3H]norepinephrine in cortical slices, although there was no additive effect when they were combined (113) . Acute morphine produced a depletion of norepinephrine from the hypothalamus (345), forebrain, striatum, or midbrain (134) , but that effect developed tolerance with chronic administration. Furthermore, both tolerance to morphine and withdrawal from it produced changes in the 3-adrenergic system, especially in the pyramidal neurons (3). In addition, the symptoms of naloxoneprecipitated withdrawal in morphine-dependent mice were attenuated by administration of the 3-adrenergic antagonists propranolol or atenolol, suggesting they might be effective in the treatment of opiate addiction (208) . Clearly, therefore, there is an interaction between the adrenergic and opiate systems.",

Tolerance was also attenuated by another NMDA antagonist, LY 274614 (512) . Some, but not all, withdrawal symptoms precipitated by naloxone in morphine-dependent rats were inhibited by MK-801 (329, 515) , suggesting that the effect on withdrawal was not direct and that MK-801 blocked the development rather than the expression of dependence (515) . The NMDA antagonist itself reduced distress vocalizations and social play in young rats, so that it is not clear whether its inhibition of tolerance is an artifact of its own behavioral effects or a real blockade of the effects of morphine (48) . Pretreatment with MK-801 inhibited the development of tolerance to chronic U50,488 also (508), so that it was not limited to interacting with receptors. Similarly, nitric oxide seems to play a role in the development of tolerance, because its inhibitor N~-monomethyl-L-arginine or its analogues attenuated the effects of chronic opiate agonists (51, 72, 221, 285, 329, 509) . The inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase reduced the tolerance for DAMGO challenge in morphine-tolerant rats (221) and the loss of analgesia (51, 509) and hypothermia (509) in U50,488-dependent mice. The inhibitors also reduced the withdrawal symptoms of weight loss and wet-dog shakes (285) and of jumping (72, 329) , suggesting that nitric oxide might play a role in the hyperactivity responses of withdrawal. Nitric oxide, thus, may be involved in tolerance to both u and K agonists.",

Furthermore, the benzodiazepine agonists midazolam (501) or diazepam (482) partially blocked the development of tolerance or dependence with continuous morphine infusion and attenuated naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in morphine-dependent rats. These effects may be mediated by changes in the concentration of Met-enkephalin in brain and spinal cord, with morphine reducing it and diazepam inhibiting that reduction (482) . Muscarinic receptors, likewise, influence morphine dependence. because two muscarinic antagonists, pirenzepine and 4-DAMP (4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide) attenuated withdrawal symptoms, perhaps through an inhibition of spinal and supraspinal cholinergic neurons (227) . Tolerance to morphine reduced spontaneous electrical activity of oxytocin-secreting neurons in the supraoptic nucleus, thereby reducing plasma oxytocin, but chronic U50,488 increased to, so that/z but not K receptors seemed to be involved (407) . There seems to be, therefore, a large number of physiological agents contributing to opiate tolerance and dependence.",

            "text": "Because acute morphine increases plasma corticosterone and chronic morphine eliminates that response due to tolerance (345) , corticosterone may play a role in opiate dependence. A rise in this steroid, however, also is a symptom of withdrawal (289) , so that the hormone may be indirectly involved through the mechanism of stress. Opiate tolerance and dependence could be due to a functional decoupling of opiate receptors from Gproteins and a subsequent decrease in the endogenous opiate peptides, and the NMDA receptors could mediate the response by an increase in intracellular calcium (153) . Because signs of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in morphine-dependent rats were attenuated by pertussis toxin, it has been suggested that Gproteins sensitive to the toxin may play a role in dependence (162) . Questioning the involvement of G-proteins, however, came from the finding that their concentrations did not change with chronic morphine in most rats, although there were strain differences so that only Sprague-Dawley rats exhibited any alteration, and it depended on the area of the brain and specific G-protein measured (196) . Activity in the locus coeruleus was influenced by chronic opiate stimulation, with morphine increasing cAMP-dependent protein kinase and adenylate cyclase (196) and adenylate cyclase mRNA transcript (328) in that area. Morphine also reduced catechol oxidation current (CA. OC) in the locus coeruleus, and naloxone-precipitated withdrawal increased the CA. OC signal, and the response was attenuated by excitatory amino acid antagonists, suggesting that it was mediated in part by excitatory amino acid pathways (230) . The hyperactivity of the locus coeruleus due to naloxone-precipitated withdrawal was also reduced by administration of agents that increased serotonergic neurotransmission, perhaps by decreasing the augmented excitatory amino acid input to the locus coeruleus (8) . Lesions of the locus coeruleus attenuated symptoms of withdrawal (319), further supporting that idea. In addition, there was a release of glutamate in that area after withdrawal, perhaps contributing to its activation of locus coeruleus neurons (5) .",

The autonomic areas of the rat brain exhibited increased los-like immunoreactivity during withdrawal in rats, especially the medullary nuclei, paraventricular nucleus, and amygdala, so that autonomic areas are activated during withdrawal and may contribute to the autonomic symptoms (490) .

Morphine-dependent rats given naloxone in the presence of a distinct tone and smell were later tested with those same stimuli. Their lever pressing was suppressed relative to those having undergone withdrawal not paired with the stimuli, so that behavior was disrupted in the absence of receptor occupancy (33) . State-dependent behavior involving opiate withdrawal was also demonstrated. Rats were given morphine and put in a box that had previously been paired with shock or not. Then they were subjected to naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. The group that demonstrated the most withdrawal symptoms had received both morphine and the naloxone in the box associated with shock, indicating that learned contextual fear can exacerbate acute withdrawal ( 1 ) .",

Naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in morphine-dependent rats suppressed responding for food and inhibited conditioned suppression established by pairing a novel stimulus with the injection of naloxone (136), thus indicating a disruption of operant behavior due to withdrawal.

Limited success has been achieved, although hope remains that breakthroughs will occur. Buprenorphine was compared with methadone for its usefulness in maintenance of opiate dependency. Buprenorphine reduced illicit opiate use (295, 455) , but it was not as effective as methadone, the retention rate for it being less than for methadone, and withdrawal symptoms associated with it were greater than for methadone (295) , so that it is unlikely to become a drug for treatment. Similarly, naltrexone fell short of expectations, because it had abuse potential, and the patients who abused it left the program and three of four committed suicide (304) . A new drug, levomethadyl acetate (LAAM) was longer lasting than methadone, which was an advantage because it needed to be taken only every other day, but there was risk of accidental overdose because it had a slow onset of action (376) , so it is unclear if it will be useful in treatment. Addicts maintained on methadone stayed in the treatment program better than those on vehicle, and a large dose reduced the rate of illicit opiate use, so its continued use in treatment was still recommended (491) .",

Because these regions are also involved in impulse control, they may be the opiate mechanism for overeating (32) . The lateral hypothalamus, previously shown to mediate taste preferences, increased consumption of saccharin when injected with DAMGO (363), so that it may also play a role in opiate regulation of eating.",

Chronic amphetamine increased the prophagic effect of U50,488 in rats, although the mechanism involved was not clear (27) . Strain differences also occurred in the feeding response to morphine, with Lewis rats being stimulated more than Fischer 344 rats.

Age, gender, and gonadectomy did not influence the action of a low dose of naloxone, but with a high dose sham-operated males had greater age-related and gender-related inhibition of eating. Gonadectomy at a young age also increased the effect of a high dose of naloxone. With high-fat-induced eating, the potency of naloxone increased in sham-operated females as a function of age but decreased in sham-operated males and in ovariectomized females as a function of age (240) . It is clear that there is a dissociation based on motivation for consumption and that these variables are crucial to an understanding of this phenomenon, but their significance has not yet been delineated. Similarly, receptor specificity, route ofadministration, and the macronutrients eaten interacted (293) , but the meaning of these findings has not been totally sorted out.",

The serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, however, did not affect symptoms of anorexic patients, even though there was an increase in dynorphin in them, suggesting no interaction between the systems in this disorder (22) . In bulimics, though, both serotonin and dopamine metabolites correlated with changes in 3-endorphin in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (107) , indicating a complex relationship among the systems. Dopamine also was shown to affect opiate-mediated eating in rats, although the action was situation dependent, with the D2 antagonist haloperidol enhancing naltrexone inhibition of 2-DG-induced feeding, but the D2 agonist quinpirole enhancing it in deprivation-induced eating (451 ) .

Continuous infusion of morphine in rats produced a biphasic effect, reducing carbohydrate intake and increasing fat intake for the first few days, but after that the reverse occurred. The termination of morphine produced a decrease in the relative preference for fat, but eating returned to baseline within 4-5 days (185) . There was a strain difference in response to acute morphine, with consumption of carbohydrates increasing more for Lewis rats than for Fischer 344 rats, although morphine increased fat intake equally between them (186), indicating that there may be genetic differences in preference for macronutrients and responsiveness to opiate manipulation. The effect is not specific to eating, because rats preferring a high-fat diet exhibited more analgesia to morphine, but not baseline antinociception, than those preferring a high-carbohydrate diet (187) .",

Systemic naltrexone inhibited consumption of all macronutrients in 2-DG hyperphagia but only that of carbohydrates and fats after food deprivation; when it was centrally administered, the antagonist attenuated only intake of fat under both conditions of motivation. Central 3-funaltrexamine inhibited eating of both carbohydrates and fats in both situations, but naloxonazine suppressed it only with deprivation. None of the or K antagonists had a differential effect on the macronutrients, indicating that opiate mediation of it is probably through the tt receptors (293) . Naltrexone reduced intake of both simple (maltose dextrin) and complex (sucrose) carbohydrates (241) , so that all kinds of carbohydrates might be affected by the opiate system. The opiates have also been shown to modulate taste preferences, which is not surprising, because they have some hedonic or aversive properties. Morphine enhanced palatability of pleasing tastes, as seen by the finding that rats increased eating of sucrose but did not alter amount of quinine-flavored food consumed (124) . DAMGO, too, increased ingestion of saccharin, but dynorphin reduced it, suggesting a receptor-specific reaction (363) . Naloxone reduced deprivation-induced intake of chocolate chip cookies, which were preferred, more than that of normal rat chow, when presented on separate occasions. When given concurrently, however, the difference disappeared, and when offered an aversive taste of high-fiber chow, naloxone decreased intake only at high doses, indicating that the effect of the antagonist depended on the palatability of the food (178) . Further support for opiate mediation of tastes came from the finding of Met-enkephalin-Arg6-GlyT-Leu 8 immunoreactivity in the taste buds of rats, mice, and guinea pigs (556) .",

So far, evidence has not been very encouraging, although some effects have been seen. Some studies found that concentrations of 3-endorphin in CSF (107, 327) and in plasma (327) were reduced in patients with anorexia nervosa, and there was a correlation between body mass and 3-endorphin in CSF (327) . However, treatment with megestrol acetate reversed the decrease in 3-endorphin but did not affect body weight or body mass (327) . Another study found no difference between anorexics and normal individuals in basal plasma 3-endorphin, and there was no correlation between it and body mass, but the response of the peptide to CRH was blunted in anorexics relative to normals (62), so that 3-endorphin may play an as yet undelineated role in the disorder. Similarly, dynorphin in the suprachiasmatic hypothalamic nucleus was greater in anorexics given treatment consisting of exercise than in normals who were weight matched with anorexics (thus deprived) but not exercised, but was not different from that in those not deprived, with or without exercise (22) , so opiate involvement is complex and confusing. Apparently, the opiate system does not mediate bulimia, because CSF 3-endorphin did not differ in them relative to normals (107) .",

Thus, abdominal obesity may have increased opiate activation. In dietary obesity induced in sheep, there was no increase in plasma 3endorphin relative to lean animals, but there was a potentiation of the inhibitory effect of naloxone on eating in overweight sheep (13) , so that there did appear to be an alteration of the opiate system with obesity. In rats with obesity induced by high-fat diets, the latency for the tail flick response was higher than for controls, indicating a reduction in sensitivity to pain, which is consistent with an increase in the activity of the endogenous opiate system in obesity (412) . Support for that notion came from the report that injection ofnaltrexone in an obese woman, to help control her eating, produced opiate withdrawal symptoms (237) , so that her possibly hyperactive opiate system might have contributed to her obesity.",

This, in turn, produces reward, which causes further eating, completing the circle (423) . Thus, both the K and u receptors are involved, but at different places in the eating process. DRINKING In 1993, interest in the possible regulation of drinking fluids continued its decline of recent years. Much of the work done that year involved the hypothesized relationship between the endogenous opiate system and the consumption of alcohol. The opiates do influence intake of alcohol, and drinking it alters the opiate system, although the exact nature of the connection between them still is unclear.

Similarly, locally applied ethanol increased dopamine release, but not that of serotonin, in the nucleus accumbens, and that effect was reversed by naltrexone, suggesting the opiate system as a mediator of the reward of ethanol (46) . Naloxone also inhibited the suppression of amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials evoked by ethanol in the nucleus accumbens, indicating that ethanol might be acting by an opiate mechanism (375) . Although there appears to be more evidence for that idea, there are still few clinical findings to indicate that it may be a useful tool in treatment of alcoholism.",

Administration of opiate agonists produced conflicting results, although much of the inconsistency could be accounted for by the kind of receptor being stimulated. The u agonists morphine (30, 238) or a metabolite of it, morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) (238), reduced urine output, although morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) increased it (238) . Naloxone reversed the effect of all three, but it was thought that the action of M3G was not through opiate receptors because it is not found to bind to any receptors (238) . Dermorphin, another u agonist, given ICV but not IV, produced the opposite effect, increasing urine flow, and the u antagonist \u00a23-funaltrexamine blocked the effect. Dermorphin, however, had no effect on ef-fective renal plasma flow or glomerular-filtration rats and increased efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity, so that the action was not mediated by central changes in renal outflow to the kidneys or hemodynamics (272) . Activation of different subtypes might be responsible for the differences.",

In rat, U50,488 produced a nor-binaltorphimine-reversible increase in urine output (174, 271) and renal sympathetic nerve activity (271) . Although U50,488 (271) and dermorphin (272) stimulated urine output, it reduced sodium excretion, at least when centrally administered, indicating both K and ~t mediation of the antinatriuretic response. Cyclazocine (a mixed K and 6 agonist) (174) , and three K agonists, BRL 53114, BRL 52656, and BRL 52974 (68), also stimulated diuresis, depending on their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Because the serotonin antagonist metergoline suppressed the increased urine due to cyclazocine or U50,488 (174) , it was suggested that serotonin might be involved in the complex mechanism of K agonist-induced diuresis (174) . The effect of microinjection of DADLE into the paraventricular nucleus or supraoptic nucleus was similar to that for dynorphin, with only the former producing an opiate-mediated effect and with an interaction between opiate, adrenergic, and cholinergic mechanisms at both sites (517) . Naloxone alone (238) and naltrindole during naloxone-precipitated withdrawal from butorphanol (250) had no effect on urine output, leading to questions concerning the involvement of the opiate system in its normal regulation.",

There was still some interest in opiate involvement in depression and in autism, but other areas were overlooked for the most part. In depressed patients, baseline plasma/3-endorphin was lower than in normal controls (356) , but that may be due in part to a confounding with age, because advancing age produces lower baseline/3-endorphin, particularly in women, and depression is found more frequently in older populations (10) . There appears to be abnormal functioning of the HPA axis in depressed patients, as indicated by nonsuppression of/3-endorphin in several tests. Infusion ofcortisol produced less release of the opiate peptide in depressed individuals than in normal controls (9, 179) , and the suppression of fl-endorphin by dexamethasone was found in some patients (10) but not in others (179) . Increasing age potentiated the likelihood that dexamethasone would suppress fl-endorphin (10), supporting the ideas that age is a confounding factor. Inhibition of cortisol synthesis with metyrapone increased plasma/3-endorphin (9), but after the test, concentrations of the endorphin were again below that of controls (356) , further supporting the notion of impairment of HPA responsiveness in the disorder. Within the patient population, however, there was no difference between melancholic individuals and those with minor depression either in baseline plasma fl-endorphin or in response to ACTH (316) .",

Possible mechanisms to explain the decreases when they occurred included the suggestion that the self-injurious behavior might cause a release of endogenous opiates, which would be rewarding or would dull the pain, making the behavior less aversive (43) . In schizophrenic patients, nalmefene, a long-lasting antagonist active at 6, K, and u receptors, potentiated the benefit of neuroleptic (415) , suggesting manipulation of the opiate system might have clinical value. There was a negative correlation between concentrations of \u00a23-endorphin in CSF and dissociative symptoms in bulimic patients (107), indicating a disturbance in opiate peptides might mediate the experiences in a subpopulation of individuals. There may also be a relationship between endogenous opiates and hypochondria, because people who self: reported more illness also consumed fewer foods that mobilize the opiate system, thus possibly causing it to be underactive (45) .",

A variety of opiate agonists were used in this context, including morphine (42, 161, 353, 378, 493, 494) , one of its metabolites, M6G (42), DAMGO (34, 42) , U50,488 (34, 42, 161) , a stable dynorphin derivative E-2078 (34, 161) , DPDPE (42), buprenorphine (436) , and an inhibitor ofenkephalin-degrading enzymes, which can act like an antagonist (378) . in most situations the agonists apparently had rewarding properties, because preferences developed for the areas associated with them (34, 42, 161, 353, 378, 436, 493, 494) , although there were some exceptions, based on specific manipulations made.",

Naloxone enhanced conditioning of fear for a chamber in which rats were shocked (142) and of fear of a tone paired with a shock (220), as did quaternary naloxone and CTOP (220). Naloxone, but not its quaternary form or CTOP, also delayed extinction (220) .

When Met-enkephalin was injected into the medial hyperstriatum, it produced amnesia, but when administered to the lobus parolfactorius, it had no effect on chicks trained on a peck-avoidance task (91) . In the same situation, microinjection of DAMGO into the medial hyperstriatum also failed to alter retention (301), but injection ofdynorphin (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) into that area did impair memory, (92) , suggesting that in this structure of the brain, the effect was receptor specific. In these studies, the opiates were given before training, which could have affected the results, as found in a comparison of pre-and posttraining injections of TAPA. Although injections at both times inhibited retention, those given after training produced stronger effects (522) .",

In chicks lower doses of dynorphin(1--13) were more effective in 2-day old chicks than in 4-day old chicks, indicating a loss of sensitivity, at least in area of the brain in which injections were made, the intermediate medial hyperstfiatum. Higher doses were effect at both ages (92) . An inverse relationship exists between the endogenous opiate system and the dopamine system, because the impairment of memory produced by morphine was potentiated by D~ and D2 antagonists and antagonized by D~ and D2 agonists (79) . Vagotomy eliminated the disruptive effect of Leuenkephalin (548), although the mechanism involved was not clear. The opiates have been demonstrated to modify the amnestic effects of several manipulations, including lesions of the basal forebrain using the cholinergic neurotoxin ibotenic acid before training. Dynorphin(1-13) increased retention, thus reversing some of the impairment (521) . Transient cerebral ischemia produced marked memory dysfunction, and both dynorphin(l-13) (244) and U50,488 (245) prevented the disruption. The effect of both peptides was reversed by nor-binaltorphimine (244, 245) , suggesting mediation by the K receptors in these beneficial reactions. The facilitation of memory by posttraining injection of substance P was modified by naloxone, but only in a state-dependent fashion. When naloxone was given both before and after training, naloxone potentiated the improvement by substance P, but if given only before or after training, the antagonist inhibited the effect (470). The differential mechanisms of this state-dependent action were not clear.",

Lever pressing to postpone shock was reduced by the # agonists morphine, fentanyl, and methadone, but Sidman avoidance, which is based on the passage of time since the last shock, was unaffected by them (167), suggesting task-specific effects. The K agonist U50,488 produced only variable effects at low doses and a nonselective decrease in responding in general at high doses (167) , indicating that the ~, but not the K receptors, play a role in time-out lever pressing. As is typical of antagonists, naloxone increased retention of tbot shock avoidance in a Tmaze (151) , but the facilitation disappeared in senescence, indicating a change in the endogenous opiate system with age ( 151 ) . Spontaneous alternation is a task measuring working memory, because the animal must remember the last response and go in a different direction on the next response. DAMGO interfered with performance on this task, and the effect was reversed by 3-funaltrexamine. Dynorphin(l-13) also reversed the action of DAMGO, an action blocked by nor-binaltorphimine, indicating that the u and K receptors have opposite effects on working memory (520) . Support for the facilitation of K agonists on this task came from the reports that dynorphin(1-13) (244) or U50,488 (245) reduced the amnesia of transient cerebral ischemia (244, 245) and that dynorphin(1-13) reversed impairment induced by scopolamine (242) . Likewise, performance on the elevated plus maze was improved after injection with dynorphin(l-13) (244) or U50,488 (245) , and DAMGO interfered with it (520), providing further evidence for the enhancement of memory by K agonists and interference with it by ~ agonists.",

Then other drugs are tested for their ability to substitute for the original one and produce the same response. In 1993 a number of opiate agonists were used as SDs, including morphine (94, 125, 257, 268, 533) , U50,488 (66, 157) , bremazocine (94), BW373U86 (94), fentanyl (396), buprenorphine (401) , and nalbuphine (538) .

A three-choice discrimination was also learned between morphine, naloxone, and placebo (268) , and another between U50,488, naltrexone, and saline was established in pigeons given chronic U50,488 (157) . Naloxone was able to block the SD effects of morphine (257) , naltrexone antagonized those of nalbuphine (538) , and naltrindole reversed those of BW373U86 (94), confirming their opiate nature.",

It appears that the 6 receptors, as well as the ~ ones, mediate reinforcement, because intra-accumbens injection of DPDPE lowered the threshold for ICSS, thus potentiating it (127) . In the medial forebrain bundle, however, the b antagonist naltrindole had no effect on responding for ICSS (416) , suggesting that the area of the brain being affected is crucial for the effect. In the lateral hypothalamus, naloxone reversed the enhancement of ICSS produced by restriction ot food with perifornical placement but did not affect it with any other placement, so that hunger interacts with the reward of electrical stimulation of the brain (77) . Electrical stimulation ot the lateral hypothalamus can also induce eating, and microinjection of the K antagonist nor-binaltorphimine into that region blocked the effect. The antagonist had no effect for self-stimulation in the absence of food (i.e., ICSS), however (76) . Opiate mediation of these effects seems complex and confounded, so that the mechanisms involved have not yet been understood.",

This finding was in contrast to those with other opiates, with alfentanil, fentanyl, ethylketocyclazocine, U69,593, and BW373U86 all reducing the responding rate for food (371) . Perhaps the difference in results was associated with the mixed nature of butorphanol. Responding for saccharin in nondeprived rats was increased by DAMGO or DTLET but not the dynorphin A analogue DAKLI (188) , so that the differential reward of satisfaction of hunger as opposed to obtaining a palatable taste might explain these findings. Heroin, itself, was used as a reinforcer for traversing an alley, and rats reduced latency to start running and to reach the goal, suggesting that the heroin was rewarding (135) . Because there was only one trial per day, the rats did not ever run under the influence of the drug, which would have confounded the experiment because both morphine and alfentanil were shown to impair ability to process information in humans (88) .",

Animals quickly learn to respond to receive injections of opiates, including morphine (192) and, especially, heroin (282, 372, 424) . The self-administration rates of morphine were positively correlated with previous exposure to morphine (192) , suggesting the development of tolerance. With a progressive ratio schedule of self-administration of heroin, designed to restrict intake and minimize dependence, final rates of responding were stable and did not increase with chronic reinforcement, so that such a schedule was effective in preventing dependence. Naltrexone reduced the final rate of responding, suggesting that the antagonist attenuated the reinforcement received from heroin (424) . Responding, however, was increased with 3-funaltrexamine, naloxonazine, and naltrindole, but not with nor-binaltorphimine in more typical methods of self-administration (372) , indicating that the schedule of reinforcement was crucial to the results. In addition, the study demonstrated that the u receptors are most involved in selfadministration, then the #~ subtype and b receptors, and that the K receptors are not involved (372) . Lesions of the pedunculopontine nucleus, which is thought to mediate opiate reward, reduced self-administration of heroin, indicating that heroin must not be rewarding after the lesions and providing support for the importance of the nucleus in the reinforcing properties of opiates (282) ,",

Antagonists including naloxone, CTOP, nor-binaltorphimine, and a combination of CTOP and nor-binaltorphimine all failed to alter habituation, but naloxone and nor-binaltorphimine increased dishabituation produced by presentation of a novel stimulus after habituation to the original one (475) , indicating a slight role for the endogenous opiates in the response, although its nature was unclear.

Apomorphine-susceptible animals had a decrease in the peptide, but unsusceptible ones had an increase (95) .

This may be, in part, due to the lack of consistency in previous work, thus allowing few generalizations to be drawn. The cardiovascular responses to opiate mediation are highly susceptible to influence from experimental manipulations, as well as the response being measured, contributing to the conflicting results. In early studies, it appeared that whether the animal was conscious or anesthetized was crucial, but that variable cannot account for all the discrepancies currently being observed. Mean arterial pressure was raised by Met-enkephalin, but when acute hypotension was induced by isoproterenol or sodium nitroprusside, the enkephalin produced a depressor effect, indicating that hemodynamic responses to the peptide can be altered by acute manipulation of blood pressure (181) . To some extent, the receptor type that was activated was important. The t~ agonists tended to reduce blood pressure, although not without exception. Morphine (36, 100, 119, 414) , DAMGO (119, 414) , PLO17 (336), alfentanil (226) , and remifentanil (226) lowered it in some situations, but hydromorphone (402) and morphine (100) raised it, and dermorphin had no effect (272) . The single pressor effect by morphine was in spinal rats and was only transient (100) , so that specialized conditions were required. Increased blood pressure by hydromorphone was observed in humans who were substance abusers (402) , also an atypical population for this kind of study.",

DADLE raised systolic pressure when administered to epicardial ganglia (23) but had no effect when microinjected into the supraoptic nucleus or paraventricular nucleus (517) , so that the site of injection was crucial for these agonists, too. The mixed agonist/antagonist pentazocine also had a pressor effect (402) . Vagotomy did not affect the rise in blood pressure due to DPDPE or decreased pressure due to U50,488, but it did attenuate the hypotension caused by morphine or DAMGO (414) , suggesting that the vagus interacted with u agonists. However, vagotomy did not block the ability of naloxone to reverse all cardiovascular effects of acute morphine, and even produce an overshoot, suggesting withdrawal (36) . The reduction in mean arterial pressure by the # agonist PLO17 or the K agonist 66A-078 was suppressed by cholecystokinin-8, and its antagonist reversed the effect (541), indicating an interaction of the opiate system with cholecystokinin-8.",

Naloxone produced hypertension in some situations (36, 100, 247) or had no effect in others (247) . Naloxone and naloxone methobromide raised it when injected IV, suggesting that their action occurred at peripheral sites, because naloxone methobromide crosses the blood-brain barrier little, if at all (247), but close-arterial injection of either into the hindquarter vasculature did not affect blood pressure, calling that conclusion into question (247) . Although naloxone alone produced a small rise in mean arterial pressure, naloxone-precipitated withdrawal from morphine induced a large one (100), so that the cardiovascular system is highly sensitive to opiate manipulation. The results were the same for nor-binaltorphimine, increasing blood pressure when given to unanesthetized piglets (360) and not when injected into the hippocampal formation of rats (541) . At doses used in treatment ofautistics, naltrexone had no effect on blood pressure, indicating that it has no cardiovascular side effects to worry about (25) .",

Morphine reduced neurohypophyseal blood flow at doses not affecting blood pressure (225) , so that the two measures are not completely correlated. Both remifentanil and alfentanil also decreased blood flow to the cortex, hippocampus, and caudate, but this occurred at doses that also reduced blood pressure and heart rate (226) . Naloxone, however, did not alter cerebral blood flow in patients with complex partial seizures, as measured with PET (502), so that the role of the endogenous opiate system here is not clear. Because naloxone did increase blood flow to the stomach, small intestines, colon, and spleen, as well as renal and coronary blood flow during endotoxin shock (129) , it may be that the opiate system might mediate blood flow only under stress. These effects were attenuated by the 3-adrenergic blocker propranolol (129) , thus indicating an interaction between 3-adrenergic and opiate actions. However, renal blood flow was not affected by dermorphin (272) , suggesting that the U receptors were not involved in that response.",

When given before hemorrhage into the nucleus ambiguus, dynorphin(l-17) and -(2-17) produced a transient further suppression of blood pressure, but U50,488 did not alter it at all (445) . After hemorrhage, injection of dynorphin(l-13) or - (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) into the nucleus of the solitary tract had no effect on cardiovascular measures, except for an increase in heart rate dynorphin(1-13) (139) . It appears that a form of dynorphin is involved in responses to hemorrhage, but the differential effects of the fragments tested leave an unclear picture. Naloxone produced a pressor effect (247) during hemorrhage and reduced tissue damage resulting from reperfusion after hemorrhage (11) , suggesting that the endogenous opiate system might play a deleterious role in the effects of acute bleeding.",

Diurnal increases in plasma 3-endorphin immunoreactivity peaked at the same time as the highest heart rate occurred in horses (202), suggesting that the peptide might mediate the response. There was, however, no change in plasma dynorphin in hypertensive patients given clonidine, even though both heart rate and blood pressure declined (211) . In patients undergoing hemodialysis, there was an increase in plasma 3-endorphin during the first stage of isolated ultrafiltration and then a subsequent decrease in it in the second stage of isovolemic bicarbonate hemodialysis (212). It was suggested that the rise was analogous to that in animals with hypovolemic shock and that the drop in it might have been due to a negative feedback effect of the endorphin on its own release (212). During hemorrhage in rats there was an increase in preproenkephalin in the midbrain and spinal cord, but that in the brain stem was decreased (140) , providing additional evidence that the opiate system might be involved in cardiovascular activity. Binding of DPDPE in the amygdala was greater in spontaneously hypertensive rats than in normals, but in other areas, such as the hippocampus, hypothalamus, corpus striatum, midbrain, cortex, pons, medulla, and spinal cord, there was no difference. It was not clear if the binding in the amygdala was related to the increased blood pressure in the genetically disposed rats, however, because the number of sites but not their affinity was greater (53) .",

The well-known clinical finding that opiate agonists depress respiration was confirmed by the findings that morphine (30, 36, 119, 374) , DAMGO (119), other ~t ligands, including dermorphin (384), hydromorphone (402) , and sufentanil (439), Metenkephalin (355) , and the r agonist ICI 196967 (540) suppressed ventilatory function, although ICI 196967 did so only at high doses (540) . In addition, because U50,488 did not alter respiration when administered alone, but did reverse the depression of DAMGO and morphine (119) , it has been assumed that the K receptors do not have primary effects on the response, but the receptors do. Microinjection of the 6 agonist into either the supraoptic nucleus or the paraventricular nucleus failed to alter ventilation (517) , so that either those sites or the 6 receptors, or both, are not involved in regulation of respiration.",

The opiate system appears to interact with other agents in its action on respiration, because the depression by dermorphin was antagonized not only by naloxone, but also by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. The effect of the benzodiazepine agonist alprazolam depended on dose, with a small dose potentiating the suppression of dermorphin, but a larger dose reversing it. The benzodiazepine/GABA receptor complex, therefore, modulated the respiratory depression of u agonists (384) . Pretreatment with nimodipine, a Ca 2+ antagonist, potentiated the effect ofsufentanil (439) , and Met-enkephalin inhibited the serotonininduced respiratory rhythm in a mollusc (Lymnaea stagnalis) (355) , indicating opiate interaction with those actions in ventilation.",

More specifically, resistive loading increased plasma 3-endorphin in normals, but not in diabetics (544) . Although hypoxia itself did not raise CSF 3-endorphin in children with apnea or in victims of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, there was a higher than normal baseline concentration of 3-endorphin, suggesting that the increase was of etiological significance to the disorders and not secondary to the hypoxia (489) . In distressed, mechanically ventilated neonates during the first 3 days of life, plasma 3-endorphin was higher than in normals, but it dropped after the start of morphine, suggesting that such infants should be given adequate analgesia without concern for respiratory effects (399) . There was one conflicting report, however, that found an increase in plasma 3-endorphin with a decrease in apneas when infants with apnea ofprematurity were given xanthine, indicating a negative correlation between the peptide and respiratory dif-ficulty. No change in 3-endorphin occurred in those infants not responding to the xanthine treatment and, thus, continuing to have apnea (447) . No explanation for the discrepancy was given.",

DADLE, however, had no effect (517) , leading to rejection of the idea of involvement of the 6 receptors in this response. Morphine was reported to have a biphasic effect, first decreasing, then increasing temperature (60) . This may account for the conflicting fndings of hyperthermia after morphine (50, 52, 314) , because the measures might have occurred during the second phase. Although U50,488 did not after body temperature in one study, it did block the hypothermia induced by cerebral ischemia (245) , suggesting a role for the K receptors in thermoregulation. Dynorphin(1-13) , however, had no effect in mice subjected to ischemia or sham operated (244) , so that different receptor subtypes might be involved. Traumatic brain injury, interfered with the ability of morphine to increase brain temperature, but the peptide did raise it in uninjured animals (314) .",

Absence seizures precipitated by hyperventilation and C-diprenorphine were seen in patients with primary generalized epilepsy, using PET procedures (39) . In patients undergoing surgery, within 3 min of the injection of morphine, epileptiform brain wave activity similar to that of benign epilepsy was seen. With increasing serum concentrations of the opiate, the number of spike discharges initially increased and then decreased (277) , so that their relevance to patient welfare was not clear. In rats, a low dose of M3G injected ICV produced seizures that were attenuated by the NMDA antagonists MK-801 or CPP. It was not clear if this reflected an interaction between the opiate system and NMDA receptors, however, because naloxone did not affect the seizures, indicating that it might not be an opiate action (164) .",

A single injection diminished its capacity to produce a second seizure, even up to 2 weeks later (93), suggesting possible tolerance to its effect. Administration of Met-enkephalin into the amygdala produced kindling in rats, characterized in part by wet-dog shakes (498) . Electrical kindling of the amygdala produced a similar response, as did a combination of the two, although when the enkephalin was involved the wet-dog shakes dropped out sooner than when it was absent (498) . However, protease inhibitors that prevent the degradation of Met-enkephalin reduced the incidence and intensity of seizures in seizure-susceptible mice, indicating an anticonvulsant effect (294) . The finding that cerebral concentrations of the enkephalin increased after the protease inhibitors suggests that it was the rise in enkephalin that was responsible for the decrease in seizures (294) . This action might be different in this particular strain, as opposed to others, accounting for the convergent results.",

Naloxone alone reduced the duration of postseizure immobility after picrotoxin but did not have any effect on the development of tolerance to the proconvulsant agent (505) . The endogenous antiopiate Tyr-MIF-1 inhibited morphine-induced lengthening of the duration of postseizure akinesias but potentiated morphine's increase in the number of focal seizure episodes, indicating that the opiate action may depend on the type of seizure (504) . Conversely, seizure activity altered the potency of morphine analgesia, facilitating it, suggesting a change in opiate mechanisms after experience with convulsions (503) . Support for the anticonvulsant action of the ~ receptors came from the finding that an analogue of U50,488, U-544944A, inhibited seizures in the maximal electroshock seizure test and with electrical stimulation of the hippocampus, although at high doses U-544944A did increase pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures (149) . The type of seizure, therefore, was important with the K agonist, as it was with morphine. Dynorphin or dynorphin(2-13) inhibited epileptiform activity produced by contin-uous perfusion of penicillin or bicuculline into hippocampal slices from guinea pigs (364) . It was not clear whether the action was opiate or not, because it was not blocked by naloxone, and naloxone alone had a similar antiepileptic effect (364) .",

The alterations in spectral power were strain dependent, being greater in Lewis rats than in Fischer 344 rats (330) , indicating the importance of genetic variables in these effects.",

Tolerance to morphine did not affect the action ofU50,488 in this situation (407) . The nicotinic transmission in superior cervical ganglia was depressed by the r peptide; however, u or 6 antagonists, but not a K antagonist, inhibited the effect (562), so that the K receptors might not have mediated the response. In presynaptic calyciform nerve terminals of chick ciliary ganglia, U50,488 produced hyperpolarization, with an apparent increase in input resistance, but it inhibited spontaneously occurring miniature hyperpolarization in the terminals, which was considered to be due to a Ca2+-dependent K + conductance. This effect was abolished by the K~ antagonist nor-binaltorphimine, so that the action at this site probably was mediated by K receptors (150) .",

            "text": "The role of the 6 receptors is equally confusing, as indicated by studies with DPDPE. The peptide increased EEG activity in fetal lambs, but the effect was not altered by the 6 antagonist naltrindole and was reversed by the t~ antagonist naloxonazine (84) . In rats DPDPE increased total spectral power and highvoltage bursts (483) , but it also suppressed the EEG and behavioral excitation of morphine and was, itself, attenuated by the 6 antagonist DPDPE (483) . The agonist had differential effects on different pathways, increasing spike amplitude in CA 1 pyramidal cells, where the predominant receptor subtype is 6~. The effect was antagonized by naltrindole, supporting the involvement of t~l receptors (545) . Increases in the concentrations of DOPAC and DOPA in the nucleus accumbens and median eminence after administration of DPDPE and its blockage by naltrindole demonstrated activation of dopaminergic neurons that was probably mediated by 6 receptors (323) . In dentate granule cells (397) and in superior cervical ganglia (562) , however, DPDPE produced hyperpolarization, and it had no effect on neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius (418), Administration of DADLE to epicardial ganglia increased spontaneous neural activity, but systemic injection produced no effect (23) , so that the effect was site specific. The peptide also increased primary and secondary population spike potentials in CA1 pyramidal cells. Because the action was reversed by naltrexone, the highly specific ~ receptor (545) , the role of the 6 receptors in that situation must be questioned. Support for that view came from the finding that the/~ agonist DSLET also raised the spike amplitudes, but its action was not reversed by either naltrindole or another 6 antagonist IC1174,864 but was inhibited by naltrexone (545) .",

The enkephalin increased input conductance in the locus coeruleus, and the effect was almost totally abolished by a combination of sodium substitution and extracellular Ba 2+. It was concluded that the opiate response in this area opened K + channels and suppressed resting Na+-dependent inward conductance (17) . Met-enkephalin also facilitated nonrectifying electrical coupling respiratory neurons in Helix pomantia and coupling between serotonin-containing ciliomotoneurons in Lymnaea stagnalis, so that the enkephalin may be involved in coordination of motor patterns (128) . On isolated CNS neurons, the peptide produced a very weak hyperpolarization or depolarization in Lymnaea stagnalis (355) and inhibited serotonin-induced respiratory rhythms temporarily, before later slowing the oscillations of the membrane potentials (355) . In the dentate granule cell, Met-enkephalin produced hyperpolarization of most cells, and the effect was potentiated by the enkephalinase inhibitor thiorphan or the animopeptidase inhibitor bestatin and was attenuated by the # antagonist CTOP or the/~ agonis t ICI174,864 (397) .

Naloxone suppressed the inhibition of activity of the superior cervical ganglia induced by a short stimulus train (562, 563) . After chronic morphine, injection of naloxone precipitated withdrawal, which was characterized by hyperactivity of the locus coeruleus. Agents that increased serotonergic neurotransmission attenuated the effect of the antagonist (8) , indicating an interaction between the opiate and serotonin systems. Naloxonazine reduced EEG activity in fetal lambs (84) , but naltrindole had no action in them (84) or in rats (483) .

Naltrexone reduced the total sleep time, amount of slow-wave sleep, and amount of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and increased the total awake time and the number of awakenings during sleep in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (145) , suggesting that the endogenous opiate system was overactive in them. In young piglets, naltrexone had no effect on the sleep-wake cycle, but naltrindole decreased the percentage of time spent in sleep and increased that in wakefulness (361) . In older pigs, both antagonists produced more awake time (361) . The K antagonist did not affect the sleep-wake state at either age (360) . These findings indicate that in the early neonatal period, the 6 receptors modulate the rhythm of sleep and wakefulness, but later the behavior can be modified by receptors as well, and that the K receptors probably do not play a role in it.",

Typically, the opiate antagonists tended to have no effect, suggesting little tonic regulation of activity by the opiate system, or to reduce activity.

The site of action of the opiate was also important, because morphine had no effect when injected into the anterior dorsal or posterior dorsal striatum (32), but stimulated locomotion when administered to the ventral tegmental area (125) , the dorsal periaqueductal gray (362) , or ventromedial or ventrolateral striatum (32) .

Of the doses that stimulated activity, nap oxone blocked the effect of lower one, but higher doses produced nonreversible, fearful hyperactivity (362). Strain differences in reactivity to morphine were found, with mice selectively bred for high swim-stress analgesia being less sensitive than those with low swim-stress analgesia (353) , presumably due to differential endogenous opiate activity in the strains. Although upregulation of the opiate system alone, due to previous exposure to stress, did not affect morphine hyperactivity, pairing of the agonist with stress did potentiate the reaction (462) , suggesting that the state of the opiate system can influence the action of exogenous opiates.",

Similarly, treatment with pertussis toxin (163) or the selective K agonist spiradoline (297) reduced dopamine turnover and also inhibited hyperactivity due to morphine. This dopaminergic action of morphine was modified by an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (70) , so that nitric oxide could play a role in it. Endogenous corticosterone is also important for the effect, because adrenalectomy reduced the ability of morphine to stimulate activity (109) .",

A biphasic reaction of an initial decrease and then an increase was also seen (343, 344) , although the 0.01 dose produced only hyperactivity (344) . Although in some cases in which DAMGO did not affect activity (524, 525) , it did antagonize the increase induced by methamphetamine (524) , suggesting that # receptors might mediate dopamine-related behavior. In support of that idea, DAMGO, like morphine, facilitated both dopamine metabolism and locomotion (163) , and pretreatment with pertussis toxin inhibited both (163) . Administration of a mixed Dd D2 antagonist or a D~ antagonist, but not a D2 antagonist, reduced the action of DAMGO, indicating that the DI receptors might have mediated it (16) .",

In guinea pigs its effect was indirect, with locomotion being difficult due to the abnormal motor responses and postures induced by the peptide (63) . Naloxone and nor-binaltorphimine attenuated the effect, and sigma agonists exacerbated it, so the involvement of the K receptors was not clear (63) . U50,488 suppressed the stimulation of motor activity by morphine but not that of apomorphine, so that the K receptors did not interact with dopamine in this situation (370) . U50,488 seemed to alter the development of D2 receptors when given prenatally, however, because in these animals there was a reduction of locomotion to the D2 agonist quinpirole but not to the D~ agonist SK38393 (466) .

DPDPE produced a monophasic potentiation of locomotion, as opposed to the biphasic effect of DAMGO and the lack of action for the K agonist DAKLI (343) , indicating different profiles for the receptors. Even within a receptor type, there are differences, because DAMGO and PLO17 had biphasic effects, but DALDA suppressed locomotion consistently (344) . Alfentanil did not affect simple motor function but did inhibit fine motor behavior (88) , providing further evidence for that idea. DPEN stimulated locomotor behavior (32) , but DPLPE did not alter the hyperactivity of methamphetamine (524) , so that these 6 agonists had different effects.

This action, however, was thought not to be opiate mediated, because the compounds had low affinity for opiate receptors and because naloxone did not affect it, suggesting that receptor were involved instead (539) . Circling induced by methamphetamine was antagonized by DAMGO but unaffected by DPLPE, so that the u receptors may have interacted with the dopamine-related agent (524) . The D2 agonist apomorphineinduced circling, however, was not changed by DAMGO, DPLPE, or dynorphin(l-13), suggesting that it was not mediated by any of the three major opiate receptor types (525) . The role of the opiate system in this behavior is, therefore, totally unclear.",

Conversely, in normal rats U50,488 produced ataxia, ptosis, hunching of the back, and sedation that were blocked by the \u00a2r agonist rimaczole, suggesting an interaction between the K and a receptors (559) , Similarly, in guinea pigs abnormal motor responses and postures, with severely impaired movements, occurred after injection of U50,488 (63) , supporting other findings that the K agonists have debilitating properties. Additional support for that idea came from the finding that dynorphin(l-13) and its analogues tended to produce motor dysfunction characterized by hindlimb jerking, popcorn jumping, and barrel rolling (469) . Barrel-rolling behavior also occurred after administration of Tyr-W-MIF-1, although it was unusually short-lived, suggesting that the peptide had opiate-like agonistic effects, possibly mediated by # receptors (561) . Jumping, as well as agitation, biting, and vocalization, was induced by the morphine metabolite M3G (238) . Massive biting behavior was also produced by intranigral infusion of DADLE (310), although it was not clear if the 6 receptors were involved. Muscular rigidity, specifically of the gastrocnemius muscle, occurred after administration of alfentanil, and the effect was attenuated by the Ul antagonist naloxonazine or ~3-funaltrexamine, suggesting that it was #1 mediated (373) .

Stereotyped facial wiping behavior in response to a tactile probe in the rat pup was reduced by drinking milk or injection ofU50,488 or the D1 agonist SKF-38393. The effect of milk or the D~ agonist was blocked by the K antagonist nor-binaltorphimine, but a D~ antagonist did not affect the action of U50,488, suggesting that milk modulated activity at the dopamine receptors, which in turn promoted activity at the K receptors (428) . The # agonists morphine and DAMGO also attenuated facial wiping, as did U69,593 (476) , so that both ~ and ~t receptors appear to be involved.

In the neural lobe of the pituitary, there was a decrease in the peptide that may be responsible in late pregnancy for the removal of inhibition of oxytocin release that occurs earlier during gestation ( 121, 123) . Opiate mediation of oxytocin was supported by the finding that the increase in the hormone that occurs just before parturition was enhanced by naloxone (123) , and its release by electrical stimulation was potentiated in the final week of pregnancy but not before (121, 123) .",

Supporting the role of K receptors in parturition was the finding that U50,488, when given after the birth of the second pup of the litter, delayed the birth of the remaining pups, and preinjection of the ~ antagonist nor-binaltorphimine blocked the effect (122) .

Rats given U50,488 chronically through gestation had reduced locomotion to the D2 agonist quinpirole but not to the D~ agonist SK38393, so that the prenatal experience changed the sensitivity of the D2 receptors (466) . Chronic prenatal U50,488 also lowered birth weight of the pups, and that effect lasted through the first 10 days. Because the peptide did not alter the weight gain or food intake of the mothers or the litter size or number of dead pups (466) , it appeared that the agonist was working directly on the fetuses and not indirectly through the mother. Prenatal morphine, when combined with the catecholamine synthesis inhibitor c~-methylparatyrosine, apparently modified development of the norepinephrine system, because the turnover rate for norepinephrine in adulthood was greater than normal in the preoptic area and less than normal in the hypothalamus. Adult dopamine turnover, however, was not affected by prenatal morphine (130) .",

After receiving prenatal exposure to lead, rat pups were given morphine implants and then naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. High levels of lead resulted in attenuated withdrawal signs, including less weight loss, fewer wet-dog shakes, and fewer mouthing responses. However, corticosterone levels, which are used as an index of withdrawal, were increased, indicating a disruption of typical opiate functioning in those rats (289) . After prenatal exposure to cocaine, the ability of morphine or DAMGO to reduce ultrasonic vocalizations in neonatal rat pups was enhanced, but sensitivity to morphine analgesia was not affected. This is consistent with an increase in [3H]naloxone binding in the forebrain but not in the brain stem, which is associated with analgesia, of these rats (184) .",

Continuous maternal administration of naltrexone, which provided a blockade of the endogenous opiate system, or of morphine restricted cortical cell proliferation and maturation measured after birth, with the effect for the exogenous opiate being more severe (460) . Maternal stress, shown to induce endogenous opiate activity, altered hypothalamic 3-endorphin measured on postnatal day 10, although the timing and duration of the stress was important.

Weaning was important, because the transition was delayed by 5-10 days by a delay in weaning (366) . At 20 days, the warm-water swim-induced analgesia, as measured by an increase in vocalization afterdischarge threshold, was not naloxone reversible, but it was in adults (405), indicating a further change over age. In senescence-accelerated mice and controls, naloxone facilitated learning at 4 months of age, but at 12 months, the antagonist helped only the controls at the original dose. A much larger dose was required to have the same effect in the senescence-accelerated mice ( 151 ) , indicating a change in the opiate system with advancing age. This notion was supported by the report that dynorphin and prodynorphin mRNA in the hippocampus increased in aged rats, with the greatest rises occurring in those with severe spatial learning deficits (168) .",

Morphine decreased clinging between infant and mother, and naltrexone increased it, demonstrating the importance of the opiate system in regulating affiliation between a primate mother and her infant (465) . Exposure of juvenile rats to neonatal pups typically produces full parental behavior, but administration of morphine inhibited it, and naloxone reversed the effect of the agonist.

Daily morphine also produced an increase in the percentage ofCD8 + lymphocytes but a decrease in that of total CD4 + and CD4+CD45RA \u00f7 and a reciprocal increase in CD4+CD29 + lymphocytes, as well as greater production of polyclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) and polyclonal IgM from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

Although the response of/3-endorphin to CRH was blunted in anorexics, there was no correlation between this neuroendocrine impairment and the immune response to phytohemagglutinin (62) , indicating that the peptide played no role in that action. Thus, it had varying effects depending on a number of factors, including its fragmentation, the kind of immune response, and specific populations.",

With three 3-min swims in 1 day, there was a reduction in interleukin-2 production, in mitogenic responses to concanavalin A or lipopolysaccharide, CD4 + and CD8 + percentages, and NK lymphocytes, but with 5 days of swims with one session per day, these responses all were enhanced (468), perhaps reflecting differential stressfulness of the events.",

An explanation of the involvement of the immune system in opiate dependence suggested that a well-maintained opiate dependence can be beneficial to the organism. In opiate-naive individuals, opiate exposure activates the stress axis, producing homeostatic disruption and immunological disruption. If opiate exposure continues, however, the homeostatic and immunological responses stabilize in such a way that the individual becomes dependent on opiates, so that withdrawal will produce imbalance and destabilization that is again disruptive of immune function. It may be assumed that the immune system is compromised during this procedure (118) .",

Morphine reduced distress vocalizations in isolated young chicks and greatly inhibited rough-and-tumble play in juvenile rats. With repeated administration over days, weak tolerance developed, but that could be blocked by coadministration of the NMDA antagonist MK 801, indicating a possible interaction between opiate and NMDA receptors for these responses (48) . Distress vocalizations, which typically do not occur in the home cage with littermates, were elicited by injection of U50,488. The meaning of this finding and its opiate mediation were not clear, because naltrexone had no effect on the K-induced behavior (73) . The preference that isolated rat pups show for the smell of soiled bedding from their own home cage as opposed to clean wood chips was not affected by naltrexone, indicating lack of opiate mediation. Instead, the response was altered by clonidine, indicating involvement of the a2-adrenergic system (204). Ultrasonic vocalizations in adult male rats during the threat of attack in resident-intruder clashes were attenuated by morphine in a naltrexone-reversible way, but audible vocalizations were unaffected. Thus, there were some opiate influences on affective responses to the aversive social situation (536) .",

Naloxone antagonized the action of morphine (263, 266) and DAMGO (263) , but the #1 antagonist naloxonazine did not, indicating involvement of the #2 receptors.

Diurnal variations in plasma concentrations of/3-endorphin coincided with elevations in the pain threshold, largest pupil diameter, and increased heart rate (202), suggesting a possible regulatory function for the peptide for these responses. There were circadian rhythms in the concentration of both/3-endorphin and Met-enkephalin in the neurointermediate pituitary, with peaks occurring in both day and night, but cortical concentrations of Leu-enkephalin peaked only during the day and striatum measures of it peaked only at night, thus showing an attenuated cycle (542) .",

This could then induce heightened serotonergic activity. Support for this idea came from the finding that DADLE inhibited serotonin normally, but not in hibernation (282) . Similarly, U50,488 enhanced release of serotonin from slices of hippocampus during nonhibernation but not during hibernation, and the potentiation was inhibited by norbinaltorphimine, implicating the ~ receptors (102) . DAMGO inhibited serotonin release from hippocampus slices, in a naloxone-reversible way, in both hibernating and nonhibernating ground squirrels, and in the hypotfialamus, DAMGO and U50,488 produced release of serotonin in both states, indicating a complex nature of the roles of different opiates in regular hibernation (102) .",

            "text": "Pruritus is another behavior previously shown to be mediated by the opiate system, and it was confirmed in 1993, with IT morphine producing itching in humans (30) . Pupillary responses also occurred to opiates, with hydromorphone and pentazocine causing constriction of the pupils (402) and dilation being associated with increases in plasma/3-endorphin (202). Because there is enkephalin-like immunoreactivity in the axons of the marginal region of the avian auditory thalamus and in perikarya of the medial margin of the inferior colliculus, it appears that there is an enkephalinergic auditory pathway in parallel with traditionally recognized auditory pathways that target regions of the avian basal forebrain (126) , suggesting a role for enkephalins in auditory processes, Dryness of the mouth caused by fractionated irradiation of the head and neck was associated with markedly enhanced Leuenkephalin-like immunoreactivity in submandibular ganglion cells and an increase in the number of nerve fibers showing this immunoreactivity, so that the opiate system may mediate the dryness (158). The opiate system may play a role in nicotine dependence, because naloxone precipitated withdrawal in rats made dependent by 2 weeks of nicotine infusion, and morphine reduced spontaneous absence signs after termination of the nicotine (320) . Nicotine also produced naloxone-reversible antinociception in mice and, at lower doses, antagonized morphine analgesia, thus having a dual action involving opiate agonist and antagonist properties (2) .",
