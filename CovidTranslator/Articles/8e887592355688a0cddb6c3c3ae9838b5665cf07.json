Briefly, 5.10 3 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate 24 hr prior addition of increasing concentration of doxorubicin (0 to 100 \u00b5M). Metabolic activity of cells was analyzed by MTS assays (Promega) and IC50 of doxorubicin was calculated.",

Breast cancerspecific survival was measured from the date of diagnosis to death or censored at the last follow up. Accordingly, non-breast cancer deaths were censored at the time of death (i.e., at the time of their death, the women were considered to have survived breast cancer but died of other causes). Relapse-free survival was measured from date of diagnosis to relapse, or censored at last follow-up. We considered relapse as tumor diagnosis at primary tumor site, at secondary site and/or metastasis. In order to explore the prognostic value of FBL using the Kaplan-Meier method, the FBL expression data were first transformed into binomial data (0 for \"low expression level\" or 1 for \"high expression level\"). ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curves were used to determine the optimal cut-off point of FBL gene expression (i.e., to determine at which level of FBL gene expression best segregated patients in terms of survival). According to ROC curve analysis, breast tumor samples with a FBL gene expression below or equal to 0.085 were defined as \"low expression level\" and breast tumor samples with a FBL gene expression superior to 0.085 were defined as \"high expression level\". Survival rates were then estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and the log rank test was used to assess the statistical differences between the two groups. In Image quantification -Western blots, northern blots were quantified using ImageJ software.",

For these luciferase assays, transfection efficiency was normalised by co-transfecting pRL construct constitutively expressing the renilla luciferase gene. All data were given as relative luciferase activity (firefly/renilla).Bi-cistronic plasmid constructions have been previously described and were used to assess translation quality (i.e., CAP-dependent vs IRES-dependent translation). Briefly, renilla luciferase gene expression was under the control of the CMV promoter in the first cistron (CAP-dependent translation) while in the second cistron, the firefly luciferase gene expression was under the control of IRES from human genes (IRES of IGF1R, MYC, FGF1, FGF2 and VEGFA). All data were shown as a relative luciferase activity (firefly/renilla) allowing normalisation due to difference in transfection efficiency.Chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) -Protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked for 10 min at room temperature with 1 % formaldehyde added directly into the culture medium.Reaction was stopped by addition of 0.125 M glycine incubated for 5 min through gentle rocking. The cells were suspended in 200 ml SDS lysis buffer (1 % SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris pH 8.1) and submitted to sonication to produce small DNA fragments (200-1000 bp). Chromatin was diluted 10-fold with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01 % SDS, 1.1 % TritonX-100, 1.2 mM EDTA, 16.7 mM Tris pH 8.1, 167 mM NaCl), pre-cleared and immunoprecipitated with the antibody anti-p53 (DO-1, Santa Cruz).

            "text": "-rRNA methylation levels were quantified at 16 different sites, selected in 5.8S, 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA, byRT-qPCR.    This method is based on reverse transcription (RT) of rRNA using specific primers. RT elongation is blocked by ribose methylation when performed in presence of low dNTP concentration, while not blocked in the presence of high dNTP concentration. The long cDNA from both RT reactions was then quantified by qPCR(Belin et al., 2009). Briefly, total RNA was extracted and purified using Trizol reagent as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen).Reverse transcription was then performed using 500 ng of total RNA in the presence of 200 units of M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), RNase H minus (Promega), 40 units of RNasin Ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega), 10 mM DTT, 1 \u00b5M of each reverse primer targeting a sequence upstream to a specific methylation site, and 10 \u00b5M or 1 mM dNTPs. Reactions were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 50 min, and then stopped by one cycle of 15 min at 70 \u00b0C. Quantitative amplification of the targeted cDNAs was assessed by PCR using a LightCycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics), and the LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master Mix (Roche). The amount of methylation was calculated following the function 2 (CTlow-CThigh) , where the CT (threshold cycle) value obtained with the RT reaction at low dNTP concentration was normalized to the one obtained at high dNTP concentration. Quantification of rRNA synthesis and global methylation by metabolic labelling -Cells were incubated one hour in the appropriate medium supplemented with [5,6-3 H]-Uridine at a final concentration of 15 mCi/ml (Perkin Elmer). At the end of labelling time, cells were washed three times with ice cold 1X PBS. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent standard procedure and dissolved in formamid. 1 \u00b5g of total RNA was separated in a 1 % agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. For methylation analysis, cells were incubated 1 hr in the appropriate methionine free-medium. For labelling, cells were incubated with methionine free-medium supplemented with 50 \u00b5Ci/ml of L-[Methyl-3 H]-Methionine (Perkin Elmer) for 1 hr. At the end of labelling time, cells were washed three times with ice cold 1X PBS. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent standard procedure and dissolved in formamid. 1 \u00b5g of total RNA was separated in a 1 % agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Northern blotting -Total RNA was extracted by TriPure Isolation Reagent (Roche Diagnosis) and dissolved in formamid. 3 \u00b5g of total RNA were separated on a 8 % polyacrylamide-7 M urea gel using 1X TBE buffer. Following migration, RNA quality and quantity were verified under UV light. RNA was then transferred on the Hybond N + nylon membrane (GE Healthcare) using a semi-dry apparatus for 1 hr 30 min at 150 mA/100 W and link to the membrane by UV crosslinking (1200J). Membrane was saturated by E. coli tRNA (Roche) for 1 hr at room temperature and incubated overnight at 45 \u00b0C with PNK (Promega) [ 32 P]-labelled probes against different snoRNA. Radio-labelling was visualised by autoradiography.mRNA polysomal profiling assays. Cellular polysomal fractions were isolated as previously described. Briefly, an 80 % confluent cell culture was incubated for 10 min with 0.1 \u00b5g/ml cycloheximide (CHX) to inhibit translation due to harvest-induced stress. Washed cells were suspended in lysis buffer (0.25 M saccharose, 0.25 M KCl, 6 mM MgCl 2 and 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.1 \u00b5g/ml CHX) for nucleus/cytoplasm fractionation using a Dounce homogeneizer. Nucleus and mitochondria were eliminated by centrifugation for 10 min at 4",
