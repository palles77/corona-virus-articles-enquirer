We find experimentally that most of the Phe-tRNA present in HIV-1 infected cells lacks the highly modified Wye base in its anticodon loop and most of the Asn-tRNA in HTLV-1 and BLV infected cells lacks the highly modified Q base in its anticodon loop. Interestingly, Phe-tRNA translates a UUU codon within the ribosomal frameshift signal in HIV and Asn-tRNA translates a AAC codon within the proposed frameshift signals in HTLV-1 and BLV. Thus, the lack of a highly modified base in the anticodon loop of tRNAs in retroviral infected cells is correlated with the participation of these undermodified tRNAs in the corresponding frameshift event. This suggests that the \"shifty\" tRNAs proposed by Jacks et a/. (Cell 55,447-458, 1988) to carry out frameshifting may be hypomodified isoacceptors.",

The ribosomal frameshift sites of three of these retroviruses, the gag-pro frameshift site in MMTV (2) , and the gagpal frameshift sites in HIV (4, 6) and in RSV (5) have been examined in detail. Each study suggests that leutine occurs at the frameshift site. Most certainly, the frameshift signal must also involve the codon or codons upstream of the frameshift site. Indeed, three conserved tetranucleotide sequences, which are present in the overlapping reading frames of many retroviruses as well as other genetic elements [(5) and see below], have been proposed as part of the frameshift signals (5) . The signal appears to consist of a heptanucleotide sequence suggesting that at least two codons upstream of the frameshift site are also involved. A series of mutations within these proposed signals (5) (6) (7) have confirmed that they are involved in frameshifting and have led Jacks et a/. (5) to propose the existence of specialized tRNAs [designated \"shifty\" tRNAs (5) ] which mediate the frameshift event.",

            "text": "HTLV-1 (13-15) and BLV (IS, 17) require two ribosomal frameshift events, both of which are in the -1 direction, to align the different reading frames for ex- lated in the zero frame and the initial A represents the 3' base of the proline codon, CCA, in HTLV-1 and the serine codon, UCA, in BLV (13-17). Thepro-polframeshift site may involve the heptanucleotide sequence, U UUA AAC, where leucine (UUA) and asparagine (AAC) are translated in the zero frame and the initial U represents the 3' base of the proline codon, CCU, in both viruses. The shift to the -1 frame at the 3'end of each heptanucleotide frameshift signal (5) results in translation of a leucine codon, either CUA or CUC, at the gagpro and pro-pal frameshift sites of both viruses except at the pro-pal site of HTLV-1 where the shift results in translation of the proline codon, CCA (73-17). The elution profiles of several aminoacyl-tRNAs from BLV infected and uninfected cells (Fig. 2) and from HTLV-1 infected cells (Fig. 3 ) are shown. The aminoacyl-tRNAs examined are required for translation at and around the suspected ribosomal frameshift sites of each virus. The chromatographic profiles of Leu-, Lys-, and Phe-tRNAs (see Fig. 2 ) as well as those of Pro-and Ser-tRNAs (data not shown), from BLV infected and uninfected cells are very similar. The only tRNA which manifests a significantly different profile in the two sets of cells is Asn-tRNA where a much higher proportion of the Q deficient isoacceptor occurs in infected cells. Although a set of control cells was not available for comparison to the aminoacyl-tRNAs isolated from HTLV-1 infected cells, several conclusions can be made about the elution profiles of the tRNAs shown in Fig. 3 . The chromatographic profiles of Phe-(see Fig. 3 ) Pro-, and Ser-tRNAs (data not shown) are similar to those observed in BLV infected and uninfected cells. The Leu-tRNA profile from HTLV-1 infected cells is similar to that observed from other mammalian tissues (I I). The elution profile of Asn-tRNA, on the other hand, manifests a deprivation of Q base as is characteristic of tRNAs from other retroviral infected cells examined in this study. An isoacceptor which is characteristically found to be elevated in rapidly dividing and/or neoplastic cells is Lys-tRNA, (IO, 18). Lys-tRNA,, which is the minor isoacceptor that elutes second from the column, is not elevated in BLV (Fig. 2 ) HTLV-1 (Fig. 3) or HIV (Fig. 4) infected cells. However, Lys-tRNA,, which is the major isoacceptor that elutes last from the column, is altered in HTLV-1 and in HIV infected cells. Cochromatography of the Lys-tRNA from HIV infected and uninfected cells'shows that Lys-tRNA, from infected cells elutes slightly ahead of that from control cells (see Fig. 4 ). Similarly, Lys-tRNA, from HTLV-1 infected cells elutes slightly in front of that from rabbit reticulocytes (and in the same position as that from HIV infected cells) demonstrating that this isoacceptor is altered in HIV and HTLV-1 infected cells. Presumably the alteration is a hypomodification of one or both of the highly modified bases in the anticodon loop of this isoacceptor (see column 3 in Table 1 ). It is of interest to note that Lys-tRNA, is the primer for HIV reverse transcriptase (19- HIV infected cells (-) was 21) and is utilized within the ribosomal frameshift signal in HTLV-1.",

In contrast, infection of mouse cells with Moloney murine leukemia virus, which expresses the gagpolfusion protein by translational readthrough of an inframe termination codon (22) does not result in a deficiency of Q base in Asn-and Asp-tRNAs (23).

The overlapping reading frames of each genetic element listed in the table contain one of three common consensus sequences (5): either A AAC, U UUA, or U UUU where asparagine @AC), leucine (UUA), or phenylalanine (UUU) is read in the zero frame. Mutations within these sequences (5) (6) (7) have shown that the signal involves a heptanucleotide sequence (5) which is shown in the table. At least one, if not both, of the codons within each frameshift signal shown in the table corre-sponds to a tRNA which contains, under normal cellular conditions, a hypermodified base in its anticodon loop. Q base occurs normally in Asn-tRNA (9) which is coded by AAU or AAC in a number of the signals and in Asp-tRNA which is coded by GAU in the pro-pal signal of MMTV. Wye base occurs in Phe-tRNA (8) which is coded by UUU in numerous signals shown in the table. Interestingly, Leu-tRNA lacks a hypermodified base in its anticodon loop [see (24) and references therein]. We have grouped the signals into various classes based on the occurrence of Q base (Asn-tRNA, Class I), Wye base (Phe-tRNA, Class II), or lack of a highly modified base (Leu-tRNA, Class Ill) in the respective tRNA utilized (under normal cellular conditions) at the ribosomal A-site of each frameshift signal. Interestingly, whenever Leu-tRNA occurs at the A-site, either a tRNA with Q base (Asn-tRNA) or a tRNA with Wye base (Phe-tRNA) occurs at the P-site. Subclasses (i.e., IA, IB, etc.) are based on the occurrence of (or lack of occurrence of) hypermodified bases which are found normally in the anticodon loop of the tRNA utilized in the ribosomal P-site of each frameshift (see Table 1 ).",

Lys-tRNA, is altered and presumably hypomodified in HTLV-1 infected cells, but appears normal in BLV infected cells. Asn-tRNA is hypomodified in both infected cell types. In the pro-pal frameshift signals of HTLV-1 and BLV, Leu-tRNA and Asn-tRNA are utilized and as noted above Leu-tRNA does not have a hypermodified base in its anticodon loop and Asn-tRNA is hypomodified in infected cells. The observation that alteration of the conserved sequence in the frameshift signal in RSV from U UUA to U UUU or to A AAC promoted efficient frameshifting, while alteration of this sequence to G GGG or to A AAA reduced frameshifting, led Jacks et al. (5) to propose that only certain, specialized \"shifty\" tRNAs participate in the frameshift event. This proposal is also supported by the observation that only three codons, UUA, UUU, and AAC, are found at the ribosomal A-site within the frameshift signals of each overlapping reading frame examined [(!$ and see Table 11 . As noted above, the tRNA which translates one of these codons (UUA) does not contain a hypermodified base in its anticodon loop and the tRNAs which translate the other two codons normally contain a hypermodified base in their anticodon loop. However, we have found that the latter two tRNAs were deficient in this highly modified base in infected cells.",

            "text": "Clearly, the presence of G in place of the hypermodified Q base in the 5' position of the anticodon ofAsn-tRNA [ and other tRNAs normally containing Q base (9)] or of 1 -methyl-G in place of the hypermodified Wye base in the 3' position next to the anticodon of Phe-tRNA (8) would create more space in and around the frameshift site. Greater flexibility of movement of the respective tRNA antico-don might be expected in absence of a highly modified base in the anticodon loop such as is found in Leu-tRNA and in hypomodified Asn-and Phe-tRNAs. It is of interest to note in this connection that the coding properties of tRNAs lacking Q base (25-27) and Wye base (28) in their anticodon loop are altered. Furthermore, the presence of the hypermodified base, N6-(A*-isopentenyl)-2-methylthioadenine, in the anticodon loop of Escherichia co/i Phe-tRNA (which is in the same position as Wye base in mammalian Phe-tRNA) is known to stabilize the codon-anticodon complex and prevent misreading (29). It has also been shown recently that the presence of a modified base at the position just 3' to the anticodon in proline tRNAs prevents frameshifting in bacteria (50) . This study provides direct evidence that lack of a base modification in the anticodon loop of certain tRNAs may promote the frameshift event. Finally, it should be noted that human (12) and rabbit (11) reticulocytes are enriched for hypomodified species of Asn-and Phe-tRNAs which may account for the observation that HIV frameshifting occurs as efficiently in rabbit reticulocytes as in HIV infected cells (4). We do not know the mechanism by which infection with a retrovirus may alter the level of modification of certain cellular tRNAs. Studies with viral mutants might help gain insight into this problem. In any case, if alteration of a tRNA is required by some viruses for their expression, then inducing the cell to convert these tRNAs to the fully modified form may provide an avenue for inhibiting viral expression (30).",
