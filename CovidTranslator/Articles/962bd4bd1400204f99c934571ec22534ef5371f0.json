It is occasionally difficult to differentiate between a reactive and a neoplastic lymphocytosis.

If intrinsic factor antibodies are detected, a Schilling test is not necessary. A high MCV may also be associated with alcohol excess and liver disease or drugs such as hydroxycarbamide or zidovudine. Macrocytosis resulting from chronic haemolysis is associated with increased numbers of immature red cells, which appear slightly larger and more blue than normal red cells on a Romanowsky-stained peripheral blood film. Supravital staining of blood films (p. 40) or an automated reticulocyte count can be used to confirm reticulocytosis. Untreated anaemia associated with polychromasia is likely to indicate blood loss or haemolysis. The combination of red cell fragments, thrombocytopenia, and polychromasia indicates microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and should trigger further tests such as a platelet count, coagulation studies, assessment of renal function, and a search for infection or neoplastic disease. This further assessment is urgent because these may be features of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which requires speedy treatment by plasma exchange.

Investigations should include screening for renal insufficiency, subclinical infections, autoimmune diseases, and neoplasia.

Examination of the bone marrow may be help- infection and renal failure.

In chronic leukaemias, bone marrow examination may add little to the diagnosis, but the pattern of infiltration may have prognostic significance, e.g., in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

The WHO classifications are much broader in their aims and include myeloproliferative and chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. 1, 2 Application of the WHO criteria requires the results of immunophenotyping and cytogenetic analysis. The FAB classifications therefore continue to have a place (a) when these techniques are not available and (b) in making a provisional morphological diagnosis while awaiting the results of further tests. It may be necessary to issue a provisonal report, so that treatment can commence, with a supplementary report following when all diagnostic procedures have been completed. It is important that, whichever classification is used, the criteria are strictly observed so that there is consistency between different centres and countries. To avoid any possibility of confusion, FAB terminology (e.g., M1, M2) should not be applied if the WHO classsification is being used.",

In additon, the specific cytogenetic abnormalities shown in Table  23 .2 must be absent (or the case is categorized as AML, regardless of the blast count). There is a further major difference between the two classifications, specifically that chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia is classified as MDS in the FAB classification, whereas in the WHO classification it is assigned to a new category of disorder designated myelodysplastic/ myeloproliferative diseases. The details of the FAB classification of MDS are shown in Table 23 .3 and of the WHO classification in Table 23 .4. It will be noted that cytogenetic analysis is essential for the application of the WHO classification because cases of the 5q-syndrome cannot otherwise be recognized. Like the WHO classification of AML, this is a hierachical classification. Therapy-related MDS is categorized with therapy-related AML. Remaining cases are then assessed as to whether they meet the criteria for the 5q-syndrome. If they do not, they are assigned to the remaining categories, depending on the number of lineages showing dyplasia, the percentage of ring sideroblasts, the presence or absence of Auer rods, and the percentage of blast cells in the blood and marrow.

Staining for iron may also show that there is a block in iron metabolism suggestive of anaemia associated with chronic inflammatory disease. Bone marrow examination may assist in determining whether the problem is the result of peripheral destruction (increased marrow myeloid precursors) or stem cell failure (lack of narrow myeloid precursors). Typical marrow appearances occur in drug-induced neutropenia, in which there is a relative paucity of mature neutrophils and in Kostmann's syndrome (infant genetic agranulocytosis) where there is maturation arrest at the promyelocytic stage.",

It should be noted that the WHO classification defines a case with hypereosinophilia as eosinophilic leukaemia, rather than as the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, when there is evidence of clonality. The 4q12 syndrome, resulting from a cryptic deletion at 4q12 with formation of a FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene, is therefore categorized as eosinophilic leukaemia.",
