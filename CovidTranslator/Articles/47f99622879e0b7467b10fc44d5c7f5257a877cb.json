Vaccine development is focused on the principal target of the humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein, that mediates cell entry and membrane fusion. SARS-CoV-2 S gene encodes 22 N-linked glycan sequons per protomer, which likely play a role in immune evasion and occluding immunogenic protein epitopes. Here, using a site-specific mass spectrometric approach, we reveal the glycan structures on a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S immunogen. This analysis enables mapping of the glycanprocessing states across the trimeric viral spike. We show how SARS-CoV-2 S glycans differ from typical host glycan processing, which may have implications in viral pathobiology and vaccine design.",

SARS-CoV-2 utilizes an extensively glycosylated spike (S) protein that protrudes from the viral surface to bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the host cell receptor, to mediate cell entry 3 . The S protein is a trimeric class I fusion protein that is composed of two functional subunits responsible for receptor binding (S1 subunit) and membrane fusion (S2 subunit). Remarkably, the surface of the virally encoded envelope spike is dominated by an array of host-derived glycans with each trimer displaying 66 N-linked glycosylation sites. This extensive glycosylation has important implications for vaccine design.",

Numerous viral envelope proteins, including HIV-1 envelope (Env), influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and Lassa virus glycoprotein complex (GPC), possess genetically encoded N-linked glycan sequons (N-X-S/T motifs, where X is any amino acid except proline). Viral glycosylation has wide-ranging roles in viral pathobiology, including mediating protein folding and stability, and shaping viral tropism. The genetically encoded sequons can be under significant selective pressure as a mechanism for immune evasion by shielding specific epitopes from antibody neutralization. However, we note the currently reported low mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2, and as yet that there have been no observed mutations to N-linked glycosylation sites 4 . Surfaces with an unusually high density of glycans can also enable immune recognition [5] [6] [7] . The role of glycosylation in immune evasion by camouflaging immunogenic protein epitopes has been well studied for other coronaviruses 4,8,9 . As the principal antigen presented on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 virions, the S protein is a key target in vaccine design efforts. It is apparent that the viral spike will be targeted by the full assortment of vaccine strategies from nucleic-acid based approaches 10 , whereby the viral protein is expressed in vivo, to recombinant strategies whereby viral glycoproteins are delivered with appropriate adjuvants. Such strategies aim to elicit neutralizing adaptive immunity with an emphasis on achieving an antibody response at the sites of viral entry.",

We have previously validated our glycopeptide analysis methodology and applied this approach to the study of a range of other viral glycoprotein immunogens 4,20-23 , which enables cross-viral comparisons of glycosylation to be made. We report here the site-specific glycosylation at each of the 22 N-linked glycan sites found on the SARS-CoV-2 S protomer. As observed on other viral glycoproteins, there is an elevation in oligomannose-and hybrid-type glycans compared to host-derived glycoproteins, although compared to many other viruses there are still a large population of complex-type glycans displayed across the trimer surface.

This is in significant contrast to other viral glycoproteins, for example the density of glycans clusters in HIV have even enabled structural classification of their different modes of interaction 36 . In SARS-CoV-2 the oligomannose-type structures are probably protected, to some extent, by the protein component, as exemplified by the N234 glycan which is partially sandwiched between the N-terminal and receptor-binding domains (Figure 3) . We characterized the N-linked glycans on extended loop structures that were not resolved in the cryo-EM maps 18 (N74 and N149) . These were determined to be complex-type glycans, consistent with the inherent flexibility of these regions and resulting accessibility of these residues to glycan processing enzymes. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.010322 doi: bioRxiv preprint Fig. 1) . Oligomannose-type glycans comprise 32% of the total glycan pool, with hybrid-type and complex-type glycans comprising 7% and 62%, respectively (Sup. Fig. 1) . Despite the potential impact of different local protein structure on glycan processing, the overall glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 is comparable with SARS-CoV-1 S protein and other coronavirus S proteins 4, 8, 9, 15 . We have previously reported that a recombinant SARS-CoV-1 S mimetic also contained 32% oligomannose-type glycans showing a remarkable conservation in glycan processing across these coronaviruses. Whilst the oligomannose-type glycan content is well above that observed on typical host glycoproteins, it is significantly lower than is found on other viral glycoproteins. For example, one of the most densely glycosylated viral spike proteins is HIV-1 Env, which contains ~60% oligomannose-type glycans 20, 37 . This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 S protein is less densely glycosylated and that the glycans form much less of a shield compared with other viral glycoproteins including HIV Env and LASV GPC, which may be beneficial for the elicitation of potent neutralizing antibodies.",

These data suggest high levels of fucosylation but low levels of sialylation, considering complex and hybrid type glycans make up 69% of the total glycans of SARS-CoV-2. Understanding the distribution of glycan modifications across the viral spike illustrates the differential susceptibility to different processing enzymes while the absolute levels can be heavily influenced by the cellular expression system utilized. We have previously demonstrated for HIV-1 Env glycosylation that the processing of complex-type glycans is driven by the producer cell but that the levels of oligomannose-type glycans were largely independent of the expression system and is much more closely related to the protein structure and glycan density 38 .",

The glycopeptide fragmentation data were evaluated manually for each glycopeptide; the peptide was scored as true-positive when the correct b and y fragment ions were observed along with oxonium ions corresponding to the glycan identified. The MS data was searched using the Protein Metrics 305 N-glycan library. The relative amounts of each glycan at each site as well as the unoccupied proportion were determined by comparing the extracted chromatographic areas for different glycotypes with an identical peptide sequence. All charge states for a single glycopeptide were summed. The precursor mass tolerance was set at 4 ppm and 10 ppm for fragments. A 1% false discovery rate (FDR) was applied. The relative amounts of each glycan at each site as well as the unoccupied proportion were determined by comparing the extracted ion chromatographic areas for different glycopeptides with an identical peptide sequence.

Note that the flexible loops on which N74 and N149 glycan sites reside are represented as dashed lines with glycan sites on the loops mapped at approximate regions. In addition to the site-specific glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein it is also important to consider overall trends in glycosylation across the glycoprotein.

Peptides were separated using an EasySpray PepMap RSLC C18 column (75 \u00b5m \u00d7 75 cm). A trapping column (PepMap 100 C18 3\u03bcM 75\u03bcM x 2cm) was used in line with the LC prior to separation with the analytical column. The LC conditions were as follows: 275 minute linear gradient consisting of 0-32% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid over 240 minutes followed by 35 minutes of 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. The flow rate was set to 200 nL/min. The spray voltage was set to 2.7 kV and the temperature of the heated capillary was set to 40 \u00b0C. The ion transfer tube temperature was set to 275 \u00b0C. The scan range was 400\u22121600 m/z. The HCD collision energy was set to 50%, appropriate for fragmentation of glycopeptide ions.

However, the presence of glycans typical of the early stages of the secretory pathway on otherwise mature glycoproteins often closely relate to fundamental features of viral spike architecture. High viral glycan density, or extensive packing of the glycan to the protein surface, can impair the normal glycan maturation pathway by steric interference of host enzymes. Under-processed oligomannose-and hybrid-type glycans are found on the majority of viral envelope proteins such as HIV-1 Env, influenza HA and Lassa virus GPC 5 . These viral glycoproteins traffic through the secretory system and the glycosylation processing of recombinant material often closely captures the glycan maturation state of the virion. This can be particularly important for viruses such as HIV-1, where viral glycans can also be targeted by neutralizing antibodies. Coronaviruses have been reported to form virions by budding into the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartments (ERGIC)",
