            "text": "Measles is a highly contagious disease characterized by a prodromal illness of fever, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis followed by the appearance of a generalized maculopapular rash. Deaths from measles are due largely to an increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial and viral infections, attributed to a prolonged state of immune suppression. Despite the development of an effective attenuated vaccine, measles remains a leading Measles vaccines are recommended for all susceptible children and adults for whom the vaccine is not contraindicated. Despite progress in reducing measles mortality, measles remains a major cause of vaccine-preventable death and an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children, particularly sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia. The ideal measles vaccine would be inexpensive, safe, heat-stable, immunogenic in neonates or very young infants, and administered as a single dose without needle or syringe. A number of vaccine candidates with some of these characteristics are undergoing preclinical studies, including DNA vaccines and various viral and bacterial vectored vaccines. The high infectivity of measles virus is a characteristic suitable to a biothreat agent. However, increasingly high levels of measles vaccination coverage throughout the world as part of accelerated measles control efforts would protect many from the deliberate use of measles virus as a biothreat agent. Genetic engineering of a measles virus strain that was not neutralized by antibodies induced by the current attenuated measles vaccines would likely have reduced infectivity, as suggested by the fact that wild-type measles viruses have not mutated to alter their neutralizing epitopes. Measles virus meets many of the biological criteria for disease eradication. Measles virus has no nonhuman reservoir, can be accurately diagnosed, and measles vaccination is a highly effective intervention. Where measles virus differs from smallpox and polio viruses is that it is more highly infectious, necessitating higher levels of population immunity to interrupt transmission. It remains unclear whether the threat from bioterrorism precludes stopping measles vaccination after eradication, but provision of a second opportunity for measles vaccination likely could be stopped following eradication.",

CD46 is a complement regulatory molecule expressed on all nucleated cells in humans. SLAM, an acronym for signaling lymphocyte activation molecule, is expressed on activated T and B lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells. The binding sites on H for these receptors overlap and strains of measles virus differ in the efficiency with which each is used. Wild-type measles virus binds to cells primarily through the cellular receptor SLAM whereas most vaccine strains bind to CD46; however, most measles virus strains can use both CD46 and SLAM as receptors during acute infection ( Schneider et al., 2002 ) .

Three factors determine the degree and duration of protection in the newborn: (1) the level of maternal antimeasles antibodies; (2) the efficiency of placental transfer; and (3) the rate of catabolism in the child. Although providing passive immunity to young infants, maternally acquired antibodies can interfere with the immune responses to the attenuated measles vaccine by inhibiting replication of vaccine virus. In general, maternally acquired antibodies are no longer present in the majority of children by 9 months of age, the time of routine measles vaccination in many countries.

The protective efficacy of antibodies to measles virus is illustrated by the immunity conferred to infants from passively acquired maternal antibodies and the protection of exposed, susceptible individuals following administration of antimeasles virus immune globulin ( Black and Yannet, 1960 ) . The first measles virus-specific antibodies produced after infection are of the IgM subtype, followed by a switch to predominantly IgG3 and then to IgG1 and IgG4 isotypes ( Isa et al., 2002 ) . IgA antibodies to measles virus are found in mucosal secretions. The most abundant and rapidly produced antibodies are against N, and the absence of antibodies to N is the best indicator of seronegativity to measles virus. Antibodies to H and F proteins contribute to virus neutralization and are sufficient to provide protection against measles virus infection.",

Various strategies have been used to guide antibiotic therapy in children with measles. Antibiotics are indicated for children with measles who have clinical evidence of bacterial infection, including pneumonia, otitis media, skin infection, eye infection, and severe mouth ulcers. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza type b are the most common causes of bacterial pneumonia following measles, and antibiotic therapy should be directed against these pathogens. Whether all children with measles, or all hospitalized children with measles, should be given prophylactic antibiotics remains controversial. Limited evidence suggests that antibiotics administered as prophylaxis to all children presenting with measles may reduce the incidence of pneumonia but not mortality ( Duke and Mgone, 2003 ) . The potential benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis need to be weighed against the risks of accelerating antibiotic resistance.",

Functional abnormalities of immune cells have also been detected, including decreased lymphocyte proliferative responses ( Hirsch et al., 1984 ) . Dendritic cells, major antigenpresenting cells, mature poorly, lose the ability to stimulate proliferative responses in lymphocytes, and undergo cell death when infected with measles virus in vitro ( Servet-Delprat et al., 2000 ) . The dominant Th2 response in children recovering from measles can inhibit Th1 responses and increase susceptibility to intracellular pathogens ( Griffin et al., 1985 ; Griffin and Ward, 1993 ) . The production of IL-12, important for the generation of Th1-type immune response, decreases following binding of the CD46 receptor ( Karp et al., 1996 ) and is low for several weeks in children with measles ( Atabani et al., 2001 ) . This diminished ability to produce IL-12 could further result in a limited Th1 immune response to other pathogens. Furthermore, engagement of CD46 and CD3 on monocytes induces production of high levels of IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 , an immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive cytokine profile characteristic of regulatory T cells ( Kemper et al., 2003 ) . The role of these cytokines in the immune suppression following measles is supported by in vivo evidence of elevated levels of IL-10 in the plasma of children after measles virus infection ( Moss et al., 2002 ) .",

The Schwarz and Moraten (more attenuated) strains were derived from the original Edmonston strain but further attenuated through additional passage in chick embryo fibroblasts. Despite differences in their passage history, these vaccine strains have identical genomic sequences ( Parks et al., 2001 ) . The Moraten vaccine (Merck) is the only measles vaccine used in the United States, whereas the Schwarz vaccine is used in many countries throughout the world. Other attenuated measles vaccines have been produced from locally derived wild-type strains, particularly in Russia, China, and Japan. One vaccine strain, the Edmonston-Zagreb vaccine, was also passaged in human diploid cells after attenuation in chick embryo fibroblasts, which may account for its increased immunogenicity and reactogenicity. Measles vaccines spreads within the infected host. Initial viral replication occurs in epithelial cells at the portal of entry in the upper respiratory tract and the virus then spreads to local lymphatic tissue. Replication in local lymph nodes is followed by viremia (the presence of virus in the blood) and the dissemination of measles virus to many organs, including lymph nodes, skin, kidney, gastrointestinal tract and liver, where the virus replicates in epithelial and endothelial cells as well as monocytes and macrophages.",

Recently, a combined measlesmumps-rubella-varicella vaccine was licensed by the United States Food and Drug Administration (ProQuad, Merck and Co., Inc.). Licensed combination vaccines do not reduce the immunogenicity of the measles component. Most of the currently used measles vaccines were derived from the Edmonston strain of measles virus that was isolated by Enders and Peebles in 1954. These vaccines have undergone different passage histories in cell culture, but nucleotide sequence analysis shows less than 0.6% genetic differences between the vaccine strains. Vaccines in widespread use that were derived from the Edmonston measles virus stain include the Schwarz, Edmonston-Zagreb, and Moraten strains. Vaccines derived from other measles virus strains include CAM-70, and Shanghai 191. The live, attenuated measles vaccines are typically cultured in primary chick embryo or human diploid (e.g., Edmonston-Zagreb) cells for several days. The supernatant fluid is harvested and frozen. Vaccine stocks are quality and safety tested before they are lyophilized. Measles vaccines may contain sorbitol or gelatin as stabilizers and the antibiotic neomycin, but do not contain thimerosal. Traces of the reverse transcriptase of an avian retrovirus can be found in vaccines cultured in chick embryo fibroblasts but there is no evidence that this is harmful to vaccine recipients. Prior to use, the vaccine must be reconstituted in sterile diluent. Measles vaccines lose about half of their potency after reconstitution if stored at 20 \u00b0 C for 1 h, and lose almost all potency if stored at 37 \u00b0 C for 1 h.",

Each 0.5 mL dose of vaccine contains at least 1000 infective units of measles vaccine virus. The optimal age of measles vaccination is determined by consideration of the age-dependent increase in seroconversion rates following measles vaccination and the average age of infection. In regions of intense measles virus transmission, the average age of infection is low and the optimal strategy is to vaccinate against measles as young as possible. However, both maternally acquired antibodies and immunologic immaturity reduce the protective efficacy of measles vaccination in early infancy ( Gans et al., 1998 ) . In many parts of the world, 9 months is considered the optimal age of measles vaccination ( Halsey, 1983 ) , and is the age recommended by the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI). Most countries following the EPI schedule administer measles vaccine alone, although more countries are introducing combined measles and rubella vaccines as rubella control programs expand. Under some circumstances, provision of an early dose of measles vaccine at 6 months of age (e.g., in outbreaks or to HIV-infected children) is appropriate. In regions that have achieved measles control or elimination, where the risk of measles in infants is low, the age of measles vaccination is increased to ensure that a higher proportion of children develop protective immunity. For example, in the United States the first dose of measles vaccine is administered at 12 -15 months of age, as the combined MMR vaccine.",

The events that followed, and the public concern over the safety of MMR vaccine, led to diminished vaccine coverage in the United Kingdom and provide important lessons in the misinterpretation of epidemiologic evidence and the communication of scientific results to the public ( Offit and Coffin, 2003 ) . The publication that incited the concern was a case series describing 12 children with a regressive developmental disorder and chronic enterocolitis. Nine of the children had autism. Onset of the developmental delay was associated by the parents with MMR vaccination in eight children. This simple temporal association was misinterpreted and misrepresented as a possible causal relationship, first by the lead author of the study and then by the media and public. Subsequently, several comprehensive reviews and additional epidemiological studies rejected evidence of a causal relationship between MMR vaccination and autism ( DeStefano and Thompson, 2004 ) . One of the most conclusive studies was a large retrospective cohort study of over half a million Danish children that found the relative risk of MMR vaccine for autistic disorder to be 0.92 (95% confidence interval, 0.68 -1.24) ( Madsen et al., 2002 ) .",

A different diagnosed, and measles vaccination is a highly effective intervention. Although measles virus displays sufficient genetic variability to conduct molecular epidemiologic analyses, the antigenic epitopes against which protective antibodies develop have remained stable. Measles virus differs from smallpox and polio viruses, however, in that it is more highly infectious, necessitating much higher levels of population immunity to interrupt transmission. Potential barriers to measles eradication include: (1) lack of political will; (2) difficulties of measles control in densely populated urban environments; (3) the HIV epidemic; (4) waning immunity and the potential transmission from subclinical cases; (5) transmission among susceptible adults; (6) the risk of unsafe injections; and (7) unfounded fears of disease due to measles vaccine ( Orenstein et al., 2000 ) . Whether the threat from bioterrorism precludes stopping measles vaccination after eradication is a topic of debate, but, at the least, a single-dose rather than a two-dose measles vaccination strategy could be adopted ( Meissner et al., 2004 ) . The elimination of endemic measles virus transmission in large geographic areas, such as the Americas, suggests that global eradication is feasible with current vaccination strategies ( de Quadros, 2004 ) . Many believe this to be a realistic and morally imperative goal, but, as polio eradication efforts have shown, the endgame may be full of challenges.",

Alternative techniques for administering measles DNA, such as alphavirus ( Pan et al., 2005 ) , parainfluenza virus ( Skiadopoulos et al., 2001 ) , or enteric bacterial ( Pasetti et al., 2003 ) vectors, also are under investigation. Immune responses to intranasal administration of measles virus vaccines is enhanced by the use of adjuvants ( Chabot et al., 2005 ) . Novel oral immunization strategies have been developed using plant-based expression of the measles virus H protein in tobacco ( Webster et al., 2005 ) . These vaccines induced humoral immune responses following both primary immunization and as a booster dose after a DNA prime. In addition, attenuated recombinant measles virus vaccines have been used as vectors for the delivery of genes from other pathogens ( Tangy and Naim, 2005 ) .",
