            "text": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) has traditionally been classified into hemodynamic (prerenal), renal parenchymal (intrinsic), and postrenal etiologies. Although conceptually these categories provide a framework for understanding the pathophysiology of various renal insults, the clinical relevance of this taxonomy is questionable, because AKI is often the culmination of systemic, extra-renal disease, and renal-specific insults. Recent work has questioned whether azotemia secondary to volume depletion truly results in kidney injury per se or whether it represents an appropriate, physiologic renal response (i.e., marked reduction in glomerular filtration) to the need for extracellular fluid conservation. 1 Furthermore, the diagnosis of hemodynamic (prerenal) azotemia is often made in retrospect, limiting its clinical utility. Nonetheless, in people, hemodynamic azotemia (referred to as transient azotemia) is associated with a higher odds ratio for mortality, similar to persistent azotemia. 2 Although postrenal etiologies of AKI are typically recognized as structural or functional alterations in the urinary tract that prevent urine outflow, the pathophysiologic processes that result in uremia may be unrelated to renal excretory function (e.g., lower urinary tract rupture) or may be comprised of multiple components of this classification scheme. For example, in the case of a ureteral obstruction, azotemia may be the result not only of blockade of urine outflow from the renal pelvis, but also the maladaptive renal response to such obstruction, consisting of intense arteriolar vasoconstriction and influx of inflammatory cells. 3 The inflammatory response to ureteral obstruction may in itself produce significant, intrinsic renal parenchymal injury sufficiently severe to affect renal excretory function.",

The inner diameter of the feline ureter is approximately 0.4 mm (0.016 inches), making this structure highly prone to obstruction due to stricture, intraluminal concretion, mural inflammation or edema, muscular spasm, or extramural compression. 4, 5 Although calcium oxalate nephroliths and ureteroliths are most frequently implicated as obstructive lesions, 6 the emergence of blood stones, 7 inflammation and fibrosis with smooth muscle hypertrophy of the ureteral wall (strictures), 8 and circumcaval ureters 9 have made advanced imaging techniques paramount for accurate presurgical identification of the cause of ureteral obstruction. This information can inform whether referral to select institutions for specific interventions (e.g., subcutaneous [SC] ureteral bypass) is indicated. The pathophysiology of AKI secondary to ureteral obstruction is complex, and most of the available information has been obtained from species other than the cat. 3, 10 Pathophysiologic processes shared among various species include vasoconstriction, an influx of inflammatory cells and the release of proteolytic enzymes, and fibroblast recruitments with resultant fibroplasia.",

A definitive diagnosis of pyelonephritis requires identification of bacteria within the urine collected by pyelocentesis, but this procedure is rarely performed due to the associated risks of uroretroperitoneum, uroperitoneum, or urosepsis. Therefore, this diagnosis is frequently made based on the ultrasonographic appearance of the renal pelves with or without a positive bacterial culture of urine obtained by cystocentesis. The use of renal pelvic dimensions for the diagnosis of pyelonephritis is problematic for several reasons. First, there appears to be a large overlap in renal pelvic dimensions among healthy cats and cats with a variety of renal diseases, including pyelonephritis. 16 Second, the association between renal pelvic dilation and pyelonephritis was largely shaped by an experimental study in which pyelonephritis was induced in cats by ligation of the ureter and intravenous injection of Escherichia coli. 17 Finally, in other species (particularly humans), imaging criteria for pyelonephritis do not typically include the degree of renal pelvic dilation that is accepted as supportive for this disorder in veterinary medicine. 18 For these reasons, despite its ubiquity as a presumptive diagnosis for AKI, the true incidence and importance of this disease in the feline population are currently unknown.",

However, inaccurate assessment of hydration status by physical examination parameters is common, and many euhydrated and overhydrated patients are erroneously categorized as dehydrated. Other findings may include halitosis, scleral injection, bradycardia, cutaneous bruising, peripheral edema, melena, and diarrhea. Oral mucosa ulceration and necrosis are common in patients with severe uremia. These findings may be due to the phenomenon of either uremic calciphylaxis or uremic stomatitis. Although the anatomic distribution and histologic lesions vary between these two processes, the gross appearance may be similar (i.e., ulceration). 26, 27 Further work is warranted to better characterize these lesions because appropriate treatment may vary. Many of the aforementioned physical examination findings may be secondary to uremia, the primary disease process resulting in AKI (e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation, vasculitis), or concurrent extra-renal organ injury (e.g., pancreatitis).

Because many (especially geriatric) patients with AKI have underlying CKD, ultrasonographic changes (such as decreased corticomedullary definition, cysts, infarcts, small size, and irregular renal contour) are significant, and they should be considered important factors in formulating a long-term prognosis. The presence of ultrasonographic changes consistent with CKD does not preclude the possibility of a superimposed acute injury and, thus, the potential for at least partial renal recovery. Likewise, normal ultrasonographic renal architecture does not rule out the possibility of CKD. Perirenal fluid is commonly seen with a variety of etiologies of AKI and can also be seen secondary to volume overload. Aspiration and analysis of the perirenal fluid is typically unrewarding, because the fluid can be viscous, resulting in an inability to collect a sufficient volume for analysis. 34 A renal ultrasonographic finding described as subcapsular hypoechoic thickening has been described in cats undergoing fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or needle biopsy of the kidney. The presence of renal subcapsular hypoechoic thickening has a reasonably high positive predictive value for the identification of renal lymphoma (80.9%), but the negative predictive value (66.7%) does not allow for lymphoma to be ruled out in the absence of this finding. 35 Ultrasonography of the renal pelves and ureters is the most practical tool for diagnosing ureteral obstructions. The renal pelvic diameter should always be measured in the transverse plane from the tip of the renal papilla to the most proximal aspect of the ureter (Figure 50-1A) , because this (GFR) in that kidney is low. If the GFR in an obstructed kidney is below a certain threshold, historically identified with a serum creatinine concentration greater than 3.5 mg/ dL (267 \u00b5mmol/L), 36 an IV pyelogram will result in inadequate study quality due to poor uptake of contrast. Antegrade pyelography may be a better choice for detection of obstructive ureteral lesions, because this technique does not rely on an adequate GFR for proper distribution of contrast material. 37 Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging can add information about renal architecture and better characterize obstruction. These techniques also eliminate the problems associated with superimposition of soft tissue and bone, as well as shadowing artifact encountered when the overlying GI tract is filled with gas. With the recently increased availability of high-speed image acquisition on many CT platforms, this technique is likely to become the standard means of acquiring images from contrast studies.",

In this study, eight of 13 cats with ureteral obstructions that were not treated surgically survived longer than 365 days following hospital discharge. 40 This data is in contrast to a previous study that documented a lower success rate for medical management of cats with ureteral obstruction. The latter study, however, described cats with ureteral obstructions secondary to ureteral calculi, whereas the former study did not differentiate between obstructive disease caused by calculi versus alternative causes (e.g., stricture, spasm, edema, etc.). 41 Based on the results of these two studies, the authors do not recommend withholding surgery from cats with severe AKI secondary to ureteral calculi but consider supportive care (either with conventional methods or with renal replacement therapy) an option when The benefits of a restrictive fluid administration plan are becoming evident not only in AKI, but in a variety of disease states. In humans with AKI, avoidance of fluid overload is associated with a reduced risk of mortality. Furthermore, in disease states frequently encountered concurrently with AKI, such as acute lung injury, a restrictive fluid plan was associated with improved oxygenation parameters and increased numbers of ventilator-free and intensive care unit-free days. 52 In patients undergoing various abdominal surgeries, complications were significantly reduced with restrictive fluid regimens. 53 Aggressive fluid therapy resulting in volume loading frequently has the effect of decreasing serum or plasma creatinine concentrations. Although historically, aggressive fluid therapy has been lauded as an effective means of diuresing uremic toxins, the relationship between this treatment strategy and effect is more complex. A recent human study demonstrates that changes in serum creatinine concentrations were directly proportional to the degree of fluid accumulation in patients with AKI, suggesting that changes in serum creatinine concentrations are directly related to changes in the volume of distribution of creatinine. 54 Therefore, changes in serum creatinine concentration associated with administration of fluid products beyond that which is necessary to restore normal renal perfusion (when affected by volume deficits) is likely a result of dilution of this creatinine, rather than increased renal excretion.",

Many oliguric or anuric patients require no parenteral fluid therapy, because the obligatory fluid load that accompanies such treatments as parenteral or enteral nutrition administration (canned foods are typically composed of 80% to 90% water), IV antibiotics (frequently diluted), and IV catheter flushes sufficiently replace that which is lost from sensible and insensible routes. Insensible losses have been estimated to range between 12 and 29 mL/kg/day 55, 56 and are dependent on a variety of factors, such as patient activity level, underlying disease process, and body temperature. Careful attention must be given to serial changes in the patient's body weight, because peracute fluctuations in weight are most likely due to changes in fluid balance rather than changes in lean muscle or fat content. High maintenance fluid rates have been historically advocated for patients producing urine, based on the rationale that high volume fluid administration beyond that which is necessary to restore normal volume status will improve GFR. However, there is no evidence supporting this claim and, in the author's experience, this practice is often futile in restoring GFR and frequently results in fluid overload. Fluid overload with concurrent oliguria or anuria is a clear indication for dialysis.",

To ensure adequate tissue perfusion, extracellular fluid deficits should be corrected with a balanced polyionic solution. Colloidal support may also be considered to reduce the total amount of fluid administered if oliguria or anuria is suspected to be secondary to severe deficits in renal perfusion, although no benefit over crystalloid therapy has been documented in human or veterinary medicine. 42 Historically, synthetic colloids have been considered to have a volumetric equivalence ratio of 1 : 4 compared to crystalloids. 43 However, evidence suggests that the true, overall volume-sparing benefit of colloids is far less. 44 Furthermore, evidence compiled in multiple meta-analyses in humans suggests that synthetic colloidal solutions may have a deleterious effect not only on renal function, but overall survival, especially in septic patients. 45, 46 For these reasons, it is the authors' opinion that colloids should be used with caution and only be considered in the resuscitative phase of fluid therapy. In the resuscitative phase, goaldirected therapy to restore surrogate markers of perfusion (e.g., blood pressure, venous lactate concentration, venous oxygen saturation) should be employed with endpoints set to be reached within 24 hours. If oliguria or anuria is present and persists despite achievement of normal surrogate markers of perfusion, additional fluid administration should be withheld to avoid fluid overload. Avoidance of fluid overload (typically defined as fluid accumulation greater than 10% of baseline body weight) is essential, because there is ample evidence documenting the association between fluid overload and worse clinical outcomes in both humans [47] [48] [49] [50] and, more recently, dogs. 51 for a 70 kg (154 lb) human to that for a 5 kg (11 lb) feline patient, the g/kg cumulative dosage frequently found in many veterinary textbooks (0.25 to 1 g/kg bolus a variable number of times, followed by 1 to 2 mg/kg/min as a constant rate infusion) reaches the human nephrotoxic dose. For these reasons, the author does not recommend the use of mannitol as a diuretic for AKI.",

Once perfusion has been restored, provision of supplemental alkali, usually in the form of parenteral sodium bicarbonate, should be considered if severe acidemia (pH less than 7.2; bicarbonate less than 12 mmol/L) persists. The bicarbonate dosage can be calculated from the formula: One-fourth to one-third of the dose is typically given IV as a slow bolus, and an additional one-fourth is typically given over the next 4 to 6 hours. Although the preceding formula provides a framework for estimating appropriate bicarbonate dosing, the osmolality of readily available formulations of bicarbonate must be taken into account when formulating and dosing this drug. For example, the most commonly used concentration of sodium bicarbonate is 8.4% (2000 mOsm/L). The osmole load administered with this formulation is considerable, and volumes necessary to correct acid-base derangements may easily result in hypernatremia. Therefore, an alternative strategy for administration of this medication is dilution with sterile water and IV administration at the desired maintenance parenteral fluid rate (provided the patient is not anuric or severely polyuric). In the authors' experience, this practice allows for gradual (over 24 hours) correction of acidemia and avoidance of rapid administration of a large solute load. In cases of oliguria or anuria, it is difficult to provide supplementary, parenteral alkali without provoking solute and fluid perturbations. In these cases, hemodialysis is indicated to correct acid-base derangements. With this treatment modality, provision of bicarbonate is accomplished by diffusion of the anion across the dialysis membrane, without concurrent administration of a sodium or fluid load.",

Body weight should be measured two to six times daily to assess for trends in fluid accumulation or deficit. Central venous pressure measurement has traditionally been recommended as a surrogate marker of cardiac preload and, thus, fluid status. However, a thorough understanding of the limitations of this technique is necessary for appropriate interpretation, because the correlation between central venous pressure and blood volume (as well as the clinical manifestations of fluid overload) is poor. 57, 58 Diuretics The use of diuretics in the treatment of AKI is a controversial topic in both human and veterinary medicine. 59, 60 Many of the benefits of the most commonly used diuretics in veterinary AKI, furosemide and mannitol, have only been theorized or demonstrated in experimental models of AKI. In fact, there is little or no clinical evidence in human or veterinary medicine that diuretics improve outcome in established AKI. It has been postulated that the ability to respond to diuretics is a marker of less severe renal injury associated with a better prognosis. However, an increase in urine output after diuretic administration does not necessarily coincide with an increase in uremic solute excretion and, therefore, does not preclude the need for renal replacement therapy if severe uremia or acid-base and electrolyte abnormalities persist. In veterinary medicine, because renal replacement therapies are not readily available, diuretic administration plays a large role in volume management. Conversion from an oliguric or anuric state to normal urine production or polyuria may enhance the clinician's ability to prevent or manage fluid overload and thus allow administration of necessary medications and nutrition that would otherwise contribute to fluid overload.",

However, the use of loop diuretics predominates in both human and veterinary AKI patients due to the relatively high efficacy and safety margin of these drugs, compared to the osmotic diuretics. There are several potential adverse effects associated with the administration of mannitol. Mannitol is typically administered in concentrations ranging from 20% to 25%, which correspond to osmolalities of 1100 to 1373 mOsm/L, and this high osmolality can contribute to fluid overload by promoting water movement from the intracellular to extracellular space. Furthermore, administration of mannitol has been associated with the development of a renal tubular morphologic lesion called osmotic nephrosis. 61 This lesion is characterized by swelling and vacuolization of the renal tubules and resultant renal tubular dysfunction and obstruction. Cumulative doses of approximately 200 g/ person/day have been associated with this lesion, but when baseline renal function is normal, the toxic dose appears to be significantly higher. 62 When extrapolating a dose of 200 g located in the plasma membrane to stimulate intracellular translocation of potassium. 67 The potassium lowering effect of regular insulin may be observed as early as 15 minutes following administration, [68] [69] [70] but the effect is typically modest (decline of 1 to 2 mmol/L) and transient (redosing is frequently necessary within 3 to 4 hours). A potentially catastrophic adverse effect associated with regular insulin administration is hypoglycemia, so dextrose must be administered concurrently with regular insulin. If fluid overload is not present, the administration of a continuous rate infusion of dextrose following the initial bolus is recommended. Frequent assessment of blood glucose concentration is imperative, as dextrose is metabolized more rapidly than insulin, and redosing of dextrose is often required.",

Excitable cells become refractory to repolarization, thus resulting in decreased conduction of both cardiac and neuromuscular tissue. Typical electrocardiographic changes include bradycardia; tall T waves; shortened QT intervals; wide QRS complexes; and small, wide, or absent P waves. However, electrocardiographic abnormalities are variable and difficult to predict based on the degree of hyperkalemia. Concurrent acidemia and hypocalcemia likely potentiate the effect of hyperkalemia on cardiac conduction. Therefore, addressing these abnormalities may mitigate the adverse effects of hyperkalemia. Severe hyperkalemia can lead to a ventricular fibrillation or standstill. There are a variety of pharmacologic treatments available for severe hyperkalemia, but these therapies act to translocate potassium to the intracellular space or increase the resting membrane potential to allow repolarization of excitable cells, rather than enhance excretion of potassium. The efficacy of these treatments is typically modest and transient. Only provision of renal replacement therapy or restoration of native renal excretory function can significantly reduce the potassium burden in fulminant AKI.",

Nonetheless, correction of acidemia may mitigate the deleterious effects of hyperkalemia on cardiac conduction. Loop diuretics can promote kaliuresis in the distal nephron by promoting tubular flow. Although conversion from an oliguric state to one of increased urine production assists in management of electrolyte excesses (such as hyperkalemia), the authors have treated several patients whose hyperkalemia persisted despite resumption of urine production. Furthermore, loop diuretics are not a reliable means of increasing urine production in cases of anuric AKI. For these reasons, sodium bicarbonate and furosemide are not recommended as stand-alone treatments for emergent hyperkalemic AKI.",

Hyponatremia may be the result of GI or urinary losses, with or without the contribution of decreased excretion of free water. Hyponatremia, if severe (less than 120 mmol/L), may result in neurologic sequelae. In critically ill human patients, hyponatremia has been identified as a poor prognostic indicator. 78, 79 However, this association has not been made in cats. Hyponatremia is frequently encountered in the authors' practices and is putatively associated with the profound natriuresis that typically accompanies recovery phase polyuria (especially in cases in which ureteral patency is re-established following an obstruction) or aggressive water supplementation via enteral feeding tubes. This phenomenon has been documented in a cat administered both enteral water via the amount of blood that must circulate outside of the patient's body during the treatment. The smallest circuits currently used in veterinary medicine are approximately 60 mL. In a typical 5 kg (11 lb) cat with a normal RBC concentration, removal of this volume of RBCs should not contribute greatly to overall cardiovascular instability. However, removal of this volume of blood can be catastrophic in a smaller patient (e.g., 2.5 kg [5.5 lb]) that is anemic. Second, the chemical composition of some of the available hollow fiber membranes affects the tendency for blood to clot or to adhere to the fibers. If a large volume of the patient's blood remains within the fibers following attempts to return blood to the patient at the end of the treatment, significant blood loss accompanies each treatment. For these reasons, the authors recommend that any institution providing extracorporeal renal replacement therapies for cats have access to a plentiful donor RBC supply. Lastly, the extracorporeal circuits must be primed with either a crystalloid, colloid, or blood product prior to treatment. The priming solution represents a volume load obligatory to commencement of treatment. Therefore, ultrafiltration (plasma water removal) of at least the extracorporeal circuit must be achieved to maintain a neutral fluid balance throughout the treatment, unless the clinician plans to discard the blood present in the circuit following completion of the treatment. Ultrafiltration of any volume of plasma water may be difficult in patients that are hemodynamically unstable.",

It is beyond the scope of this chapter to discuss antiemetic options in detail, but the authors prefer the use of 5-HT3 antagonists or neurokinin-1 antagonists, because the former was found to be superior to metoclopramide in prevention of vomiting and nausea in uremic human patients. 91 The use of antisecretory drugs (e.g., histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) has historically been recommended for patients with AKI. Although uremic gastritis and stress-related mucosal disease are concerns in human AKI patients, gastric acid output and intragastric pH are not compatible with a hypersecretory state. 92 Nonetheless, due to the high incidence of hemorrhage from the GI tract in human AKI patients (presumably related to a combination of uremic injury and stress-related mucosal disease) and its association with mortality, 93 antisecretory drugs should be considered in high-risk patients. A recent meta-analysis showed superiority of proton pump inhibitors versus H2 receptor antagonists in the prevention of stress-related mucosal bleeding. 94 These results, in combination with the potential for accumulation of H2 receptor antagonists in patients with diminished renal function, favor the use of proton pump inhibitors. Sucralfate is frequently used for gastroprotection, but human data shows that even short-term administration of this drug to patients with AKI can result in toxic aluminum concentrations. 95, 96 Patients treated with dialysis may actually require more protein than patients with extra-renal disease, due to loss of amino acids in dialysate/filtrate. Protein restriction for the purpose of restricting the generation of uremic solutes has traditionally been advocated in veterinary medicine. However, a negative protein balance may hinder renal repair/recovery. Therefore, prescription diets marketed for feline patients with CKD may not be appropriate for feline patients with AKI.",

            "text": "One of the greatest determinants of the ease of application of extracorporeal renal replacement therapy is the size and associated blood volume of the patient. Therefore, treatment of the feline patient poses some important problems regarding blood volume regulation and RBC transfusion requirements. First, the size of the extracorporeal circuit determines Dopamine is a pharmacologic treatment for AKI that has fallen out of favor with both human and veterinary nephrologists. Dopamine was initially advocated for its perceived augmentation of renal blood flow. Its benefit in cats, however, was doubted as it was originally thought that cats did not possess renal dopamine receptors, a concept supported by the absence of changes in urine output, sodium excretion, or GFR in cats administered a low-dose dopamine infusion. 97 However, a putative dopamine receptor (DA-1) has been identified in the feline renal cortex. 98 Regardless of this recent discovery, the evidence available assessing the effect of dopamine on the feline kidney, when infused via the IV and intra-arterial routes, suggests that an increase in renal blood flow is not due to the renal effects of dopamine, but rather to the systemic cardiovascular effects. 99 Furthermore, the observed increase in urine flow is likely due to a combination of these systemic effects and an alteration in renal tubular function. 99 Fenoldopam is a drug that has received recent interest as a pharmacologic treatment option for feline AKI, because the feline DA-1 receptors show higher affinity for this drug versus dopamine. 98 Although a prolonged infusion of fenoldopam increased creatinine clearance and urine output in healthy cats, 100 the authors are unaware of any evidence of efficacy in conversion from an oliguric or anuric state in clinical cases of feline AKI. The authors do not recommend this drug as a first-line treatment, because the expense, undetermined efficacy, and unknown pharmacokinetic properties in feline AKI are major drawbacks to its use.",
