            "text": "Background: Clinical diagnosis of Japanese encephalitis is usually difficult due to non-specific signs at the early and acute stages of the infection. Virus isolation from peripheral blood is also not possible because of the short period and low level of transient viremia even in the acute stage of the disease. It is thus urgent to develop a feasible and convenient method for laboratory diagnosis of the infection. Objectives: To establish a newly designed molecular approach that can be used to detect intracellular Japanese encephalitis viral RNA in host cells. Study design: The method was firstly established and then was carried out to test its efficacy in cultured BHK-21 cells, subsequently in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from mice that have been inoculated with JE virus suspension. Results: In this study, in situ reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (in situ RT-LAMP) was established; which combines merits of recently developed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and in situ reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (in situ RT-PCR). Conclusions: The newly designed method can detect viral RNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a short time with high sensitivity and efficiency. (W.-J.

            "text": "Japanese encephalitis (JE) is one of the very important mosquitoborne viral infectious diseases in the world, infecting approximately 10% of the susceptible population in Southeast Asian countries each year. 1 The etiological agent of JE belongs to the family Flaviviridae which also includes many other related viruses such as yellow fever virus, dengue viruses, and West Nile virus. The genome of the JE virus is composed of a positive single-stranded RNA of approximately \u223c10,000 bases in length. 2 Infection rates of JE virus in epidemic regions usually vary, ranging from a few cases to 20% of the population. 3 Clinically, at least 50,000 cases and 10,000 deaths occur each year, mostly among children in Asia, 4 in spite of mass vaccinations which have been implemented in many endemic countries. 5 Diagnosis of JE by clinical symptoms is not feasible due to nonspecific signs at the early and acute stages of the infection. Neither is it possible to isolate the JE virus from peripheral blood because of the short period and low level of transient viremia even in the acute stage of the disease. 6 Nowadays, the laboratory serodiagnosis of JE uses a versatile and convenient approach to detect immunoglobulin M (IgM) or IgG antibodies in serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). 7, 8 More recently, molecular techniques, e.g., the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), to amplify gene fragments of viral RNAs are increasingly being used to make diagnoses. 9, 10 Nevertheless, the low copy number of viral RNA in the blood of JE patients makes it difficult to extract RNA from this source. 11 Utilization of the RT-PCR to detect viral RNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), also called in situ RT-PCR, was thus developed as a molecular tool which does not require messenger (m)RNA extraction. The technique has been applied to diagnosing JE virus infection in PBMCs in a mouse model. 11 The technique of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is based on the principle of a strand displacement reaction and the stem-loop structure that amplifies the target gene fragment under isothermal conditions. 12, 13 Because the target is initially recognized by six distinct sequences, followed by another four distinct sequences, amplification of the target sequence is expected to be highly selective. 13 Furthermore, there is no need for any high-cost instrument (such as a thermocycler or gel imaging system), making the technique reliable, simple, rapid, and cost-effective for detecting and differentiating examined genomic nucleic acids. 12 ",

The primers were selected to target the prM gene derived from the T1P1 strain of the JE virus. In order to validate the sensitivity and specificity of the primer set, 0.1 and 0.5 g of total RNA extracted from JE virus-or mock-infected BHK-21 cells were separately subjected to the RT-LAMP reaction at 42 \u2022 C and 60 min for RT and subsequently at 65 \u2022 C and 60 min for the LAMP reaction. In the meantime, the RT-PCR was used in the same experiment as a positive control. The results indicated that the viral RNA could be detected from the extract of JE virus-infected BHK-21 cells, but not that from mock-infected cells, at both concentrations, shown as DNA ladder-like products (Fig. 1A) . In the RT-PCR, viral RNA was also detected and showed a single band representing the 868-bp fragment (Fig. 1B) . To examine the limit of the reaction time, LAMP was performed at 10-min intervals (20-60 min). While the viral gene was detected as early as 40 min, a time course of 60 min for amplification was shown to be the optimal condition (Fig. 2) .",

Subsequently, the virus migrates to the central nervous system (CNS) where brain inflammation or encephalitis may occur. 16 JE can be fatal; fatality rates of the infection statistically differ in different localities from 10% to 50%. 17 Those who recover from the infection with clinical symptoms often display sequelae with serious neurological impairment and/or mental retardation. 18, 19 As a result, rapid and efficient techniques for the early diagnosis of JE are urgently and critically needed. In past years, virus isolation from nerve tissues and antibody (IgM and IgG) detection from serum and/or CSF have extensively been used to detect JE virus in most laboratories. However, molecular techniques including RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR assays are believed to be more useful due to their characteristics of rapidity, high sensitivity, and high specificity. 20, 21 The techniques have been routinely used for identifying the JE virus in acute-phase serum or CSF samples from patients. 21 Drawbacks of these molecular techniques actually include requirements for delicate labor and experienced techniques as well as a relatively expensive instrument, resulting in restricted application in a number of laboratories in developing countries.",

            "text": "Various gene fragment-amplification techniques, such as RT-PCR, real-time RT-PCR (TaqMan or SYBR green), and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), have been developed during the past decade, with the goal of rapidly identifying the JE virus with greater accuracy. [22] [23] [24] Despite the high magnitude of amplification, these PCR-based methods require either high-precision instruments for amplification or elaborate methods for detection of the amplified products. In the meantime, these methods are often cumbersome to adapt for routine clinical use. After the development of the LAMP technique, a new era of the rapid and efficient identification of microbial infections has been initiated. It is particularly useful as its reaction can be monitored through real-time detection of changes in turbidity. 13, 25 Moreover, the high sensitivity and specificity facilitates its potential use in the laboratory diagnosis of a number of infections, covering all kinds of organisms. 12 Thus far, the technique has been applied to detect or identify viruses, [26] [27] [28] [29] fungi, 30 bacteria, 31 protozoa, [32] [33] [34] and even vertebrates. 35 Recently, the technique of RT-LAMP was modified from the conventional LAMP; this is specifically useful in efficiently and rapidly detecting or identifying various RNA viruses, including flaviviruses, 28, 36, 37 togaviruses, 38 the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, 26 and the H5N1 avian influenza virus. 27 Application of RT-LAMP to JE virus detection has been shown to be relatively rapid and allows for virus quantification. 14 It was demonstrated that the technique can be used for the rapid diagnosis of JE using acute-phase CSF samples during an epidemic. 37 In spite of RT-LAMP detection of the JE virus being rapid and quantitative, this approach requires a larger number of serum or CSF specimens to achieve a clinical diagnosis of JE patients. It was noted that the JE virus can persist in mice for 4-16 weeks following intraperitoneal inoculation and may later be reactivated. 39 In addition, the JE virus is also reported to persist in the nervous system of some patients. 40 As a matter of fact, flaviviruses including the JE virus and other flaviviruses have been identified to exist in PBMCs of convalescent blood samples, indicating the possibility of persistent viral infection in leukocytes. 41 Moreover, JE viral RNA fragment has ever been amplified from white blood cells during the acute phase of infection. 42 This suggests that detection of such viruses in leukocytes may help make a diagnosis even though the blood was collected in the acute viremia stage. In order to achieve this goal, we herein established a technique called in situ RT-LAMP, which was successfully applied to detect JE virus in both cultured cells and PBMCs isolated from infected mice.",

Furthermore, one advantage is that the experiment can be run at a constant temperature. Thus there is no need for a thermocycler that is necessary when running this technique with a conventional RT-PCR. Although in situ RT-PCR can actually skip the process of RNA extraction, it still needs an expensive instrument, a thermocycler. In other words, in situ RT-LAMP actually is more convenient than both in situ RT-PCR and LAMP.",

However, no satisfactory signal was shown either in gel electrophoresis or on blotted NC membranes in the experiment using infected BHK-21 cells. This suggested that the large size of DIG molecules labeled on the outer primer FIP probably interrupted their binding to stem-loop DNA. Thus we shifted the DIG-labeling to dCTP. It turns out that the amplification of nucleic acids was successfully detected; it could clearly be differentiated from that in the control group (mock-infection). This indicated that Dig-labeling of dCTP is relatively efficient, compared to primer labeling, and is much more efficient, resulting in better visualization and easier differentiation from negative results. In addition to detecting the JE virus in cultured BHK-21 cells, the technique was also applied to detect the virus in PBMCs isolated from whole blood of infected mice. Eventually, the virus was detected at 1, 3, and 5 d post-inoculation, consistent with our previous work using in situ RT-PCR. 11 Nearly half of the inoculated mice dying of the disease (data not shown) suggested that most infected PBMCs may have migrated into brain tissues. 43 Taken together, this newly designed technique of in situ RT-LAMP is a sensitive (a higher detection rate), rapid (no more than 1 h), efficient (under isothermal conditions), cheap (no need for expensive instrument), and convenient (not labor-intensive) method. This new diagnostic design can serve as a robust tool for diagnosing JE virus infection, especially in remote and developing countries. It is particularly useful to detect viruses in blood samples, usually the genomic copy number is low, 42 collected at the acute stage or which are persistently infected. Theoretically, this delicate technique can also be applied to diagnosing other viruses that normally infect leukocytes or PBMCs, e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with advantages of economy, convenience, and high efficiency.",
