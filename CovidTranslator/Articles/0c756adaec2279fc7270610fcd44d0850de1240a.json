            "text": "Since then, large-scale sporadic outbreaks of PED caused by PEDV variants have occasionally occurred in China. However, the molecular diversity and epidemiology of PEDV in different provinces has not been completely understood. To determine the molecular diversity of PEDV in the Hubei Province of China, we collected 172 PED samples from 34 farms across the province in 2016 and performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) by targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene. Seventy-four samples were found to be PEDVpositive. We further characterized the complete spike (S) glycoprotein genes from the positive samples and found 21 different S genes with amino acid mutations. The PEDV isolates here presented most of the genotypes which were found previously in field isolates in East and South-East Asia, North America, and Europe. Besides the typical Genotypes I and II, the INDEX groups were also found. Importantly, 58 new amino acids mutant sites in the S genes, including 44 sites in S1 and 14 sites in S2, were first described. Our results revealed that the S genes of PEDV showed variation and that diverse genotypes of PEDV coexisted and were responsible for the PED outbreaks in Hubei in 2016. This work highlighted the complexity of the epidemiology of PEDV and emphasized the need for reassessing the efficacy of classic PEDV vaccines against emerging variant strains and developing new vaccines to facilitate the prevention and control of PEDV in fields.",

Previous researches have shown that the S gene is one of the most variable genes in the PEDV genome and that it is a useful marker for determining the genetic diversity of PEDV Tian et al, 2014) . In recent years, PEDV has spread throughout the Hubei Province of China and adversely affected pig farming. In this study, to determine the infection status and to better understand the molecular characteristics of PEDV in different districts in Hubei, we screened PED samples for PEDV and investigated the full-length S genes. Our results revealed the coexistence of multiple PEDV genotypes with novel genetic mutant sites in the S genes in Hubei. These findings can help better understand the epidemic status of PEDV as well as aid in developing new vaccines for the control and prevention of PED.",

Recent studies have shown that the S 477_629 fragment located in the CTD (residues 253-638) and the S 1_320 fragment located in the NTD (residues 21-324) are essential for binding to APN and sugar, respectively (Deng et al, 2016) .

The results showed that, except HBJZ-1 and HBJZ-2, all the other 19 spikes had 2-11 new aa mutant sites in comparison with the reference sequences. Consistent with previous reports, more mutation sites were detected in S1 (44 sites) than in S2 (14 sites) (Supplementary Material S2). In addition, 23 aa changes were observed in the S 1_320 fragment, which is much higher than the 6 aa changes found in the S 477_629 fragment (Supplementary Material S2).

            "text": "The gene encoding the spike protein of CoVs is an important gene responsible for viral entry and therefore has been extensively studied (Sun et al., 2008; Belouzard et al, 2012; Li et al, 2012; Wang et al, 2014; Li, 2015; Liu et al, 2015) . The S gene of PEDV has been used widely as a molecular marker in studies on the genetic diversity of PEDV Tian et al., 2014) . Upon characterization of the complete S gene, we confirmed that 7 different genotypes of PEDV coexisted in the Hubei province in 2016. Based on genetic characteristics and emerging periods, PEDV can be sorted into 3 genogroups: GI (classical), GII (variant), and INDELvariant group (Vlasova et al, 2014; Lee, 2015; Wang et al, 2016) . Most of the PEDV strains in this study belonged to the GII group, which was consistent with the PEDV situation in China, where most of the highly prevalent variant PEDV strains in China have been found to be members of the GII genogroup since 2010 (Wang et al, 2016) . However, new variant PEDV strains of the GI and INDEX groups were also found in this study. These results indicated that the epidemic heterogeneity of PEDV in Hubei is more complex than previously assumed.",

            "text": "Although we could not detect new recombinant events among the S genes, the coexistence of diverse PEDV genotypes in the same location may foster viral genomic recombination and promote the emergence of more novel PEDV strains (Tian et al, 2014; Li et al, 2016a) . More worthy of concern is the fact we found 58 new aa mutant sites in the S genes in these field strains. In some districts, multivariants and accumulating aa mutations in the S gene could be observed in a herd. For example, we detected 3 different S variants in a herd in Ezhou: HBEZ-2, HBEZ-3, and HBEZ-4 ( Figure 2 , Supplementary Material S2). HBEZ-2 had 2 aa mutant sites (Y307D and H1047Q), HBEZ-3 had 3 aa mutant sites (L300S, Y307D, and H1047Q), and HBEZ-4 had 4 aa mutant sites (L300S, Y307D, H1047Q, and H1377Q). Whether these mutants can lead to higher virulence or escape from immunoprotection from classical vaccines is unknown. However, it is important to reassess the efficacy of the current PEDV vaccines against the emerging variant strains to determine cross-protection. Further isolation and sequencing of full-length genomes of these PEDV strains will be helpful in determining their pathogenicity and subtle genetic characteristics. Living PEDV strains will be useful for assessing the protective efficacy of current vaccines and could be used for developing new vaccines for PEDV infections.",
