As nanosized obligate intracellular parasites, viruses share many biophysical properties with artificial nanoparticles in extracellular environments and here we show that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) accumulate a rich and distinctive protein corona in different biological fluids. Moreover, we show that corona pre-coating differentially affects viral infectivity and immune cell activation. Additionally, we demonstrate that viruses bind amyloidogenic peptides in their corona and catalyze amyloid formation via surface-assisted heterogeneous nucleation. Importantly, we show that HSV-1 catalyzes the aggregation of the amyloid beta peptide (A\u03b242), a major constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease, in-vitro and in animal models. Our results highlight the viral protein corona as an acquired structural layer that is critical for viral-host interactions and illustrate a mechanistic convergence between viral and amyloid pathologies. doi: bioRxiv preprint HSV-1 is an example of another virus with high prevalence, infecting nearly 70% of the human population 17 .",

Latent HSV-1 is occasionally reactivated causing peripheral pathology and under certain circumstances it can migrate into the central nervous system causing herpes simplex encephalitis; the most common cause of sporadic fatal viral encephalitis 19 . In the context of the current work we focused on the presumptive role of HSV-1 in the pathology of AD. A number of risk factors have been associated with AD, including the E4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (Apo-E), diabetes, vascular pathology, neuroinflammation and infections 20 . Several recent studies have supported the theory of a significant role of HSV-1 in the disease 21 . HSV-1 DNA was found to be localized within amyloid plaques in AD patients and HSV-1 infection has been shown to promote neurotoxic A\u03b2 accumulation in human neural cells and to the formation of A\u03b2 deposits in the brains of infected mice 22,23 . Moreover, the presence of anti-HSV IgM antibodies, which indicate HSV reactivation, is correlated with a high risk of AD and antiherpetic treatment is correlated with a reduced risk of developing dementia 24,25 . Despite these correlations, the mechanism by which viruses induce amyloid aggregation, the major pathological hallmark of AD, is not known.",

            "text": "The term \"protein corona\" refers to the layer of proteins that adhere to the surfaces of nanostructures when they encounter biological fluids. Nanoparticles adsorb biomolecules in biological fluids due to the high free energy of their surfaces 1 . The importance of the corona layer stems from the fact that it constitutes the actual surface of interaction with biological membranes or \"what the cell sees\" in the in-vivo context 2 . Hundreds of proteins have been identified to confer a distinct biological identity of nanoparticles in different microenvironments depending on their size, chemistry and surface modification (recently reviewed in 3 ). These factors were found to be critical determinants of the biodistribution and pharmacodynamics of nanoparticles. On the other hand, the ability of the surfaces of nanoparticles to partially denature certain corona proteins exposing \"cryptic epitopes\" highlights the role of the protein corona in the toxicology of nanoparticles [4] [5] [6] . The formation of a protein corona is particularly important in the context of nanoparticle interaction with amyloidogenic peptides such as amyloid beta (A\u03b242) and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), which are associated Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 disease, respectively. Nanoparticles have been shown to catalyze amyloid formation via binding of amyloidogenic peptides in their corona, thereby increasing local peptide concentration and inducing conformational changes that facilitate fibril growth via a heterogenous nucleation mechanism 7, 8 . This surface-assisted (heterogenous) nucleation has been demonstrated for several nanoparticles with different amyloidogenic peptides including IAPP and A\u03b242 9,10 .",

Reinfection with RSV occurs throughout life, usually with mild local symptoms in the upper airways 14 .

While natural infection leads to the production of neutralizing antibodies, the ability of these antibodies to protect from subsequent RSV infections appears to be incomplete 15, 16 . Neither a vaccine nor an antiviral therapy is yet available except for passive immunization using the anti-RSV monoclonal antibody palivizumab. Early vaccine trials using formalin-inactivated RSV led to enhanced disease with up to 80% of vaccinees being hospitalized and two dying following natural RSV infection 14, 16 .

Notably, both RSV and HSV-1 possessed distinctive proteomic profiles depending on the biological fluid ( Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2c ). In addition, RSV protein corona profiles were different between HP and jHP ( Supplementary Fig. 2d) ; however, the use of a different mass spectrometer for this experiment prevents direct comparison to the data shown in Fig. 1 . The reproducibility of the corona preparations was further assessed by calculating coefficient of variation (CV) between the replicates for each sample type.

This, together with the PCA analyses comparing RSV to HSV-1 and the controls indicated enrichment of particular corona factors depending on the surface properties of the virus. Moreover, proteomic data sets were visualized by heat map and hierarchical clustering revealing an extensive protein corona signature for viral samples in each biological fluid ( Fig. 1d) . While the serum-free viral particles contained some host factors that were incorporated during virus replication and budding from the cells, the virus was able to subsequently accumulate a different set of host factors which were dependent on the biological fluid. As such, a characteristic viral biological identity was associated with each biological fluid. The viral corona factors present on all three replicates in each biological fluid are listed in Supplementary Data 1. In addition, the raw proteomics data are available in Supplementary Data 2.",

A layer of factors was observed interacting with the viral surface upon encounter with cell membranes, which was absent in serum free conditions (Fig. 2a) . This demonstrated that RSV accumulated a layer of corona factors that are likely involved in cellular interactions. We also performed cryoimmuno electron microscopy using antibodies for certain proteins that were detected in the viral corona proteomic analysis. In serum-free conditions, we used an anti-RSV F-protein antibody. For adult HP and BALF coronae, we used anti-human IgG and anti-surfactant protein A (SP-A) antibodies, respectively. The bound antibodies were detected using secondary antibodies coated with 10 nm gold nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. 2b , corona factors were bound to the surface of RSV and labelled with the respective antibodies. To further confirm the binding of these factors, we performed western blot analysis on viral particles incubated with either HP or BALF. Several bands were detected for SP-A in the BALF corona samples and were completely lacking in the HP corona samples ( Supplementary Fig. 4a ). In addition to the main SP-A bands, several high molecular weight bands were also detected with the anti-SP-A antibody. This suggested that SP-A was forming complexes either on its own or with other corona factors. When stained with anti-human IgG antibodies, bands were detected in both coronae, but with higher intensity in the HP corona compared to the BALF corona ( Supplementary Fig. 4b) . The bands were normalized to the RSV G protein band which was used as a 6 loading control ( Supplementary Fig. 4c ).

Corona precoating had a significant effect on viral infectivity as demonstrated by the differential frequency of GFP expressing cells quantified by flow cytometry (Fig. 3a-b and Supplementary Fig 5) .

No significant differences in cell-toxicity were observed. jHP pre-coating, on the other hand, slightly enhanced infectivity, but it did not reach significance (Fig. 3b ). This lack of inhibition compared to adult HP could be attributed to the lack of anti-RSV antibodies in the selected jHP ( Supplementary   Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, we investigated the effect of different coronae on the activation of human moDCs by quantifying the expression of the maturation marker CD86. Differentiated moDCs were infected by virions produced under serum-free conditions with different corona pre-coatings for 4h in serum-free conditions. The cells were then washed and incubated in serum-containing medium for 72 h prior to flow cytometry analyses. Only the BALF pre-coated virions were able to induce moDC activation and increase CD86 expression ( Fig. 3c-f) . Notably, adding BALF alone or corona-free RSV did not activate the cells, showing that it was the RSV-BALF corona complex that induced moDC activation. In addition, BALF pre-coating enhanced infectivity in moDCs as quantified by flow cytometry of GFP expression ( Fig. 3e-f ). Altogether, this shows that pre-incubation of virions produced under serum-free conditions in different biological fluids to allow a corona formation greatly affects infectivity and the ability to induce moDC activation in a biological fluid-dependent manner.",

The HP corona proteomic profile was consistent with the observed inhibition of infectivity (neutralization), indicating that the corona characterization methodology is representative of the actual layer of host factors that surrounds the viral particle. Notably, despite having comparably high levels of virus-specific IgG antibodies, BALF imparted opposite effects on infectivity compared to HP (Fig. 3) . At the proteomics level, GO analysis revealed that the viral BALF corona comprised a different set of factors that are less enriched in immunological components and more enriched in factors related to adhesion, anchoring, protein targeting to membrane, interspecies interaction, mutualism through parasitism, protein complex binding, and macromolecular complex binding (Fig.4) . This was further supported by the western blot analysis where the corona of the BALF incubated virions was less enriched in human IgG compared to the viral HP corona ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . and MP on viral neutralization via palivizumab, which is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the F protein of RSV. We found that the enhancing effects of the coronae were completely lost in the presence of the antibody and that the antibody neutralization curves were very simillar in the presence and the absence of the viral corona (Fig. 5b) . These data demostrated that high affinity antibodies were able to compete out corona factors to impart host protection.

We investigated the interaction of RSV with a model amyloidogenic peptide (NNFGAIL) derived from the IAPP. We traced the ability of RSV to accelerate amyloid kinetics using the wellestablished thioflavin T (ThT) based methodology. The ThT dye changes its fluorescence emission spectrum upon binding to amyloid fibrils, and plotting relative changes in the fluorescence intensity against time illustrates the kinetics of the amyloid formation process 28 . Using the ThT assay, we found that the presence of RSV particles significantly accelerated amyloid formation of NNFGAIL compared to non-infected cell supernatant demonstrating that RSV acted as a catalytic surface for amyloid aggregation (Fig. 6a) . As a control, we compared the kinetic curves of the virus-containing medium vs. virus-free medium upon incubation with ThT alone without a peptide. As shown in Supplementary Fig 7a, the curves were very similar, indicating that the relative changes that we observed in the presence of amyloidogenic peptides are not due to unspecific interaction of the virions with the ThT dye. Additionally, extensive fiber networks were observed with TEM within 100 min. of incubation with RSV ( Fig. 6b ) and some virions were located at the tip of these fibers (Fig. 6c) . Moreover, RSV catalytic activity was more efficient than lipid vesicles of similar size; however, it was dramatically reduced in the presence of 5% FBS, indicating a competition between the peptide and other corona factors for the viral surface (Fig. 6d) .",

The catalytic activity was reduced by the presence of FBS, also indicating a competition at the viral surface (Fig 7b) . In addition, HSV-1 was more efficient than liposomes in accelerating the amyloid aggregation kinetics (Fig. 7c) . Furthermore, the propensity of HSV-1 mediated amyloid catalysis was higher for the more amyloidogenic A\u03b242 peptide compared to the shorter, less amyloidogenic A\u03b240 peptide (Fig. 7d) . Amyloid induction was further confirmed by TEM demonstrating fibril formation within 100 min. of incubation with viral particles (Fig. 7e-h) . Amyloid protofilaments and fibrils at different stages of elongation were observed interacting with the viral surface. Fig. 7e and f show multiple fibrillary structures emerging from one viral particle suggesting that a nucleation mechanism was taking place on the surface, thereby sparking fibril elongation.

Moreover, we studied the corona in FBS, which is the most commonly used cell growth supplement for viral production and in-vitro studies. We compared the RSV corona to HSV-1 and lipid vesicles of similar size with positively or negatively charged surfaces as well as the biological fluids per se. PCA, quantitative intrasample variability analysis and correlation matrices demonstrated that the RSV corona profiles were well separated from that of HSV-1 and lipid vesicles (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 2 and 3 ). Intra-sample variability could arise in the process of sample preparation during incubation, washing and digestion or during mass spectroscopy-based detection 38 . Notably, while the viral corona profile was dependent on the biological fluid, it was not a mere reflection of the most abundant proteins, as demonstrated earlier for nanoparticles 27 and as shown in the Table 1 of the top 10 proteins present in the viral coronae in comparison to crude biological fluids. The viral protein corona was visualized using TEM, which revealed a layer surrounding the viral surface involved in cellular interactions ( Fig. 2a) . Using cryoimmuno electron microscopy and western blot, we could detect specific proteins identified from the proteomic analysis (human IgG in HP and SP-A in BALF) associated with RSV upon incubation with HP or BALF, respectively ( Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 4) . Functionally, the coronae from the different biological fluids enhanced RSV infectivity except for the HP corona, which completely neutralized the virus (Fig.   3 ). Taken together, using several complementary methods, our data demonstrated the specific enrichment of differential corona profiles on viral surfaces. As such, the protein corona represents an initial phase of viral-host interactions that precedes cellular interaction and affects subsequent infectivity. Unlike the viral genome-coded surface proteins, the viral protein corona is an acquired structural layer that is dependent on the viral microenvironment resulting in different viral identities based on the target tissue and the target organism.",

Other factors of documented immunological functions such as fibrinogen 39 , properdin 40 , annexin A1 41 , protein S100 42 and vimentin 43 were also detected in the HP corona (Supplementary Data 1). These factors could be parts of an immunological corona that enables efficient viral neutralization and/or immune system modulation. On the other hand, jHP, which lacked the anti-RSV antibodies, failed to neutralize the virus and the jHP corona was less enriched in immunological factors compared to the HP corona (Table. 1 and Fig. 3) . Interestingly, the BALF corona enhanced viral infectivity in both HEp-2 cells and moDCs despite having equally high anti-RSV IgG antibody titers as compared to HP according to ELISA analysis ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The proteomic and GO analysis showed that the BALF corona was less enriched in immunological factors (Fig. 4) . Additionally, less IgG was detected in the BALF corona in the western blot analysis ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . The failure of BALF to neutralize the virus despite being rich in anti-RSV antibodies suggested that the differential protein corona profile could affect antibody binding in BALF conditions. This might explain the recurrence of pulmonary RSV infection even in individuals with high IgG titers 15 . An alternative explanation is that the BALF anti-RSV antibodies are of lower affinity than their HP counterparts and are thus less able to compete out other corona factors that enhance viral infectivity. It remains to be elucidated, which avidity is required in order to compete out the corona layer. The list of proteins that were uniquely detected in the BALF corona included pulmonary surfactants which are known to enhance RSV infectivity 44 , nucleolin and EGFR, which were shown to be important for RSV cell entry 45, 46 , adhesion molecules (such as tetraspanin, .

Notably, pre-incubation of RSV with BALF was the only condition that induced moDC activation (Fig. 3) . Importantly, it was not the combination of the proteins in the biological fluids or the virus per se that affected the outcome, but rather the viral-corona complex, as shown by the lack of moDC activation by BALF or RSV alone. Moreover, and in accordance with the documented role of corona factors in nanoparticle immunogenicity 47 , our results demonstrated the role of the acquired corona layer in virus-induced immune activation that might contribute to disease pathophysiology. It can be speculated that the viral corona factors are part of the pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPS), which are recognized by the innate immune system. It also suggests that corona factors need to be considered in the design of vaccines and adjuvants for efficient stimulation of the immune system.",

Here, we present an alternative but not mutually exclusive explanation. Our corona-driven hypothesis suggests that the virus interacts with extracellular amyloidogenic peptides as part of the pathogenesis, and the bound peptides do not necessarily possess an immunological and/or an antimicrobial function. This is further corroborated by studies showing that amyloids can enhance the infectivity for viruses such as HIV and HSV 35, 58 , and the fact that amyloid precursor protein (APP) knock-out animals are not more susceptible for infections compared to wild-type animals 59 . From this perspective, virus surface-assisted nucleation might have evolved as a mechanism by which viruses modulate the host's extracellular environment by catalyzing the phase transition of certain peptides from soluble to insoluble forms; a phase change that could lead to toxic gain or loss of function or both. In addition, the viral surface-assisted nucleation mechanism could be extended to other viruses correlated with neurodegenerative pathology such as HIV and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) 60 and influenza virus and post-encephalitic parkinsonism 61 To conclude, the current work was based on the biophysical equivalence between viruses and artificial nanoparticles in extracellular environments. We here demonstrated that nanotechnological concepts such as the protein corona and surface-assisted nucleation can be extended to infectious viruses. We showed that viral protein corona accumulation and amyloid catalysis are two aspects of the same phenomenon, namely viral surface interaction with extracellular host proteins. This phenomenon leads to the modulation of how viruses interact with cells and/or the induction of conformational changes in bound proteins that leads to accelerated amyloid aggregation. These findings highlight the potentially critical role of viral extracellular interactions in viral infectivity and in relation to extracellular protein pathology.

Briefly, 10-fold dilutions of virus were added onto Hep2 cells for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, then inoculum was removed, and fresh maintenance medium was added. The plates were examined in the microscope on day7 and the number of wells for each dilution that was positive for GFP was noted. The titer was calculated according to the method of Karber. The viral stock of 7x10 8 genome copies/ml corresponded to log10 6.7 TCID50/mL. For HSV-1, strain F HSV-1 stocks were prepared by infecting African green monkey kidney (VERO) cells at 80-90% confluency in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 5% FBS or in serum-free DMEM.

Furthermore, the phenomenon of amyloid polymorphism 62 might in part be related to the different nucleation mechanisms, where we hypothesize that the viral-catalyzed heterogeneously nucleated amyloids would be polymorphically distinct from homogeneouslynucleated amyloids that result from aberrant protein expression/overexpression. This hypothesis can be tested in future studies on the A\u03b2 polymorphism in familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease 63 , and whether this structural polymorphism can be traced back to different nucleation mechanisms related to different etiologies. Finally, the implication that viruses are capable of inducing conformational changes in bound host factors leading to exposure of cryptic epitopes may prove important for better understanding the correlation between viruses and autoimmune diseases.",

All donors had given oral and written informed consent to participate in the bronchoscopy study, in line with the Helsinki Declaration. Briefly, healthy subjects of male and female gender were recruited at the Department of Respiratory Medicine and Allergy, Karolinska University Hospital, Solna. These subjects were examined after denying regular tobacco smoking and history of allergy or lung disease during an interview. The final inclusion required that these subjects displayed no signs of pulmonary or disease during clinical examination, spirometry and clinical blood testing including electrolytes, white cell differential counts and C-reactive protein. Bronchoscopy with bronchioalveolar lavage (5 x 50 ml of sterile and phosphatebuffered saline) was performed according to clinical routine at Karolinska University Hospital, Solna. The obtained BALF was concentrated using 5 kDa cutoff 4 ml spin concentrator (Agilent Technologies, USA) before infectivity experiments.Lipid vesicle preparation and characterization1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP), 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (DSPG),and cholesterol were bought from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL, USA). All other compounds were bought from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The lipids were dissolved in chloroform in molar ratios of 9:1 (DSPC / cholesterol) for neutral liposomes, 9:1 (DSPC / DOTAP) for cationic liposomes and 9:1 (DSPC / DSPG) for anionic liposomes. The liposomes were formed by the thin film hydration method followed by extrusion through a polycarbonate membrane. Briefly, chloroform was evaporated by heating the sample tube to 65 \u00b0C and gradually reducing the pressure to 70 mbar under a nitrogen flow in a vacuum rotary evaporation system (B\u00fcchi R-114, B\u00fcchi Labortechnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland). The resulting thin lipid layer was hydrated with 500 \u03bcL of PBS by gently stirring the tube in a water bath (65 \u00b0C) for 1 h. The sample was then extruded 11 times (65 \u00b0C) through polycarbonate membrane (pore size of 200 nm) with a syringe extrusion device (Avanti Polar Lipids) after which the sample was quickly cooled down and stored in a refrigerator. The concentration of the samples was 19 \u00b5mol/mL. The size of the liposomes was analyzed with a Zetasizer APS dynamic light scattering automated plate sampler (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, United Kingdom). The concentration of liposomes was determined using Nanosight (Malvern, USA). The zeta potential was measured at 25 \u00b0C in DTS 1070 folded capillary cells with Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments). Protein corona proteomics FBS was obtained commercially (ThermoFisher, USA). HP was obtained and pooled from at least 3 different healthy donors. jHP was obtained and pooled from at least 3 different infants participating in a prospective cohort of 281 children born into the cohort between 1997 and 2000 in Stockholm, Sweden. The study was approved by the Human Ethics Committee at Huddinge University Hospital, Stockholm (Dnr 75/97). MP was obtained and pooled from at least three different Indian rhesus macaques that were RSV seronegative. Ethical permit Dnr N2 / 15, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital, Solna. All protein corona experiments described below were performed in technical triplicates. For the viral corona proteomic experiments, freshly-harvested serum-free RSV supernatant (not-sucrose cushion concentrated) containing 6.6 x 10 9 RSV genome equivalents or serum-free DMEM produced HSV-1 stocks (2.1 x 10 8 PFU/ml) was incubated with 10% v/v solutions of different in for 1h at 37 \u02daC. Before adding the viruses, all the biological fluid solutions were adjusted to 10 mM sodium citrate (SigmaAldrich, Germany) to prevent coagulation. As a control, uninfected cell supernatant prepared in a similar way was also incubated with the biological fluid solutions. For lipid vesicles, 3 x 10 11 of 200 nm positively or negatively charged lipid vesicles were incubated with 10% solutions of biological fluids at similar conditions. After incubation, viral/nanoparticle corona complexes were spun at 20,000 g at 4 \u02daC for 1 h, supernatant removed, and the pellet resuspended in 1 ml PBS. The pellet was washed twice with PBS using the same centrifugation conditions then boiled at 95 \u02daC for 5 min. before measuring the protein content using Micro BCA\u2122 protein assay kit (ThermoFisher, USA). The viral/nanoparticle corona complexes were then resuspended in PBS and adjusted with ammonium bicarbonate to a final concentration of 20 mM. The samples were reduced by addition of 1:20 v/v 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 45 min. at 56 \u02daC and alkylated with 1:20 v/v 100 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 45 min at RT in the dark. Proteins were digested with trypsin (MS gold, Promega) 0,1 \u00b5g/\u00b5l overnight at 37 \u00b0C (trypsin : protein ratio 1:50). For sample clean-up, the samples were applied to strong cation exchange SCX microcolumns (Strata-XC Phenomenex). The microcolumns were initially washed with 100% methanol followed by MilliQ grade water. The samples were adjusted to >0.1% formic acid and then applied to the columns. After washing with 30% methanol and 0.1% formic acid the samples were eluted with 30% methanol and 5% ammonium hydroxide. Samples were dried in a SpeedVac and submitted to mass spectrometry (MS). For MS analysis, samples were dissolved in 3% ACN, 0.1% formic acid to end-concentration 1\u00b5g/\u00b5L. 1-2 \u00b5l of sample were analyzed with a hybrid LTQ-Orbitrap Velos or with an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid Mass Spectrometer (ThermoFisher, USA). For the Velos system, an Agilent HPLC 1200 system (Agilent) was used to provide the 70 min gradient. Data-dependent MS/MS (centroid mode) followed in two stages: first, the top-5 ions from the master scan were selected for collision induced dissociation with detection in the ion trap (ITMS); and then, the same 5 ions underwent higher energy collision dissociation (HCD) with detection in the Orbitrap (FTMS). For the Fusion system, An UltiMate 3000 UHPLC System was used to provide the 70 min gradient. Datadependent MS/MS (centroid mode) followed in two stages: first, the top-10 ions from the master scan were selected for collision-induced dissociation with detection in the ion trap (ITMS); and then, the same 10 ions underwent higher energy collision dissociation (HCD) with detection in the Orbitrap (FTMS). The data was searched by Sequest under the Proteome Discoverer 1.4.1.1.4 software (ThermoFisher) against the following Uniprot protein sequence databases; bos taurus version 170310, rhesus macaque version 170704, human version 160210, RSV version 160210 HHV1 version 180613, and Chlorocebus sabaeus version 180613 using a 1% peptide false discovery rate (FDR) cut-off limit. For samples containing proteins from multiple species, combined species databases were created by merging the corresponding protein databases. For label-free quantification, protein MS1 precursor area was calculated as the average of the top-three most intense peptides. Only proteins significantly detected (FDR 1%) in all three technical replicates in each sample were used in the downstream data analysis.",
