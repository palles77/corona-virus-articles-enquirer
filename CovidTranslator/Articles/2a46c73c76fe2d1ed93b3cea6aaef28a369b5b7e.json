Study design: Data were collected from the UK paediatric intensive care audit network (PICANet) and costs calculated using the National Health Service (NHS) reference costing scheme. Results: There were 114 admissions in which HMPV was detected. The number of admissions associated with a code of HMPV rose steadily over the study period (three in 2006 to 28 in 2014) and showed significant seasonal variability, with the peak season being from November to May. Children required varying levels of intensive care support from minimal to complex support including invasive ventilation, inotropes, renal replacement therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). HMPV was associated with five deaths during the study period. The associated costs of PICU admissions were estimated to be between \u00a32,256,823 and \u00a33,997,823 over the study period, with estimated annual costs rising over the study period due to increasing HMPV admissions. Conclusions: HMPV is associated with a significant healthcare burden and associated cost of care in PICUs in the UK.",

            "text": "Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a pneumovirus that was first identified in the Netherlands in 2001 [1] . It is a ubiquitous virus, with most children being infected by 5 years of age, but continuing to experience re-infections throughout life [1] . Studies have shown that HMPV is identified in 3.9%-8.5% of children with clinical symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) who are hospitalised [2] [3] [4] [5] . The attributable fraction of HMPV (proportion of children who have HMPV detected where HMPV is considered to be the cause of the illness) to infected children with respiratory symptoms has been calculated to be between 73-90%, similar to that of RSV and influenza [6, 7] . Annual rates of hospitalisation in children under 5 years of age associated with HMPV are approximately 1 in 1000 in the United States (US) [8] . This is a similar burden to influenza (1 in 1000) but lower than RSV (3 in 1000) [8] . Estimates of the prevalence of HMPV within the community setting are more variable and are influenced by the cohort being sampled, values range from 1.3% to 20% of those with symptoms of URTI/LRTI [9] [10] [11] . A study of 3257 children in the US has estimated the annual outpatient burden of HMPV to be 55 clinic visits and 13 emergency department visits per 1000 children [8] .",

Other possible explanations include that six new PICU's (of a total of 34) began adding data from their units to PICAnet during the course of this study, or that there was an overall 15% increase in PICU admissions in the UK over the study period [18] .",

Similar data for UK PICU admissions related to RSV are not available, however, one study has investigated all cause bronchiolitis admissions to UK PICUs. It is known that approximately 80% of bronchiolitis admissions are caused by RSV. If considering PICU admissions for bronchiolitis in infants under 1 year alone then those attributable to RSV within this cohort would be approximately 45 per 1000 PICU admissions [24] .

This places some restrictions on conclusions that can be drawn about HMPV as a causative organism of the clinical characteristics observed. In addition to this, 8.8% of children had another infective pathogen coded in addition to HMPV during their stay. However, 91.2% of patients only had HMPV coded during their PICU stay and 84.2% of patients had a respiratorybased primary diagnosis suggesting HMPV was the reason for PICU admission for many children.",
