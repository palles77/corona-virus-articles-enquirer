By contrast, another canine virus, minute virus of canines (MVC) (Binn et al., 1970) has been considered to be a ''non-pathogenic orphan virus'' (Carmichael, 1999) . MVC, also known as canine parvovirus type 1 (Carmichael, 1987) or canine bocavirus (Manteufel and Truyen, 2008) , and CPV-2 are unrelated parvovirus species belonging to different genera of the Parvoviridae (Macartney et al., 1988; Mochizuki et al., 2002; Schwartz et al., 2002) . However, subsequent experimental studies revealed that MVC is a perinatal pathogen of dogs (Carmichael, 1987; Macartney et al., 1988) . Clinical discrimination of the etiology of contagious pneumoenteric diseases of dogs is generally difficult, and at present, diagnosis for MVC infection is available only from particular research laboratories.",

Thus, MVC is distributed worldwide among domestic dogs of all ages (Carmichael et al., 1994; Hashimoto et al., 2001; Jang et al., 2003; J\u00e4 rplid et al., 1996; Mochizuki et al., 2002; Pratelli et al., 1999; Truyen et al., 1996) . The virus is pathogenic for the fetus and infection of pregnant bitches results in abortion (Carmichael et al., 1991; Truyen et al., 1996) . MVC infection of young pups, typically less than 1-month old, may be either asymptomatic or cause a milder illness than that caused by CPV-2 (Carmichael et al., 1994; Macartney et al., 1988) , although Two of the three adult dogs kept in a family developed severe gastroenteritis. From the feces of one of the affected dogs a minute virus of canines (MVC) was detected by PCR and virus isolation. That this virus had recently infected the dogs was indicated by high anti-MVC antibody titers of their sera. No other virus commonly associated with canine gastrointestinal disease was implicated. As no previous association of MVC infection and disease in aged dogs had been described, further characterization of the isolated virus was performed to determine if it had unique pathogenic or genetic properties. Experimental infection of adult dogs did not result in clinical disease and comparison of the viral genome with other MVCs did not reveal any novel elements. The American, Japanese and Korean MVC strains studied were closely related to bocaviruses of bovine and human origin, and appeared to have evolved uniquely in the dog population after dividing from the common ancestor of bocaviruses. Further detailed clinical and virological studies are warranted to define the role of MVCs in disease in adult dogs.",

By contrast, the pathogenic potential of MVC for adult dogs has been considered to be minimal (Binn et al., 1970; Carmichael et al., 1991 Carmichael et al., , 1994 Hashimoto et al., 2001; Mochizuki et al., 2002) . Genetic analysis has shown that the genomic structure of MVC is similar to those of bovine parvoviruses (BPV) and human bocaviruses (HBoV), and the genome size of an American GA3 strain is 5402 nucleotides in length (Schwartz et al., 2002; Sun et al., 2009) . In this context, we had an opportunity to study a new strain of MVC. In a small group of dogs housed together an elderly dog was taken ill with signs of severe gastroenteritis, suspected initially to be due to CPV-2. Contrary to our expectations, a MVC was the only virus recovered in cell culture from a fecal specimen from the dog. Because to our knowledge this is the first time that MVC had been isolated from an old diseased dog, the isolate was subsequently examined for any unique features, focusing especially on its virulence for dogs and its genomic properties.",

The dogs had been vaccinated annually with combined canine vaccines that had no CCoV component. The Yorkshire terrier was taken to a veterinary clinic because of vomiting in November, 2008. On the third day of hospitalization, the dog had bloody diarrhea in addition to vomiting. CPV-2 was considered as a possible cause but since a fecal specimen was found to be negative by a commercial test kit for CPV-2, it was submitted to our diagnostic laboratory for further virological examination. The dog received symptomatic therapy and subsequently recovered. The older Chihuahua also had similar signs just before the present case; however, the cause could not be established because no specimen was available for examination. The younger Chihuahua did not show any clinical signs throughout the period. Serum samples were taken from all three dogs in December, 2008, about 1 month after the incident.",

In this context, MVC was strongly suspected of being associated with the clinical signs of gastroenteritis. In the household, the two older dogs recovered from the illness and in the youngest dog the infection may have taken a subclinical course. This outcome is, however, contrary to the current concept of canine MVC infection (Carmichael, 1987 (Carmichael, , 1999 and suggested that the present MVC isolate 08-017 might be a novel strain which is pathogenic for adult dogs. Subsequently this was not confirmed by the experimental infection of the adolescent SPF dogs. In simple terms, the present animal experiment results may reflect the most probable relationship that occurs between MVC and aged dogs in the field: MVC infection of aged dogs results in antibody production but is accompanied only rarely by virus shedding so that MVC has not been found in most field cases.

In addition, it had neither insertion nor deletion in the genome sequence and was not a recombinant between other parvoviruses including CPV-2. That is, the present MVC isolate 08-017 seems to be molecularly very similar to previous MVC strains (Schwartz et al., 2002; Ohshima et al., 2004) . Therefore, it is uncertain why the clinical signs suspected of CPV-2 infection appeared in this case and how MVC played a part in the development of the illness. There is a possibility that some host factors and/or accidental secondary pathogens influenced the disease course, and it may be worthwhile to perform experimental infection of immunosuppressed dogs, for example, to determine if MVC is pathogenic in these conditions. In any event, it would be useful to carry out more field case studies, with MVC included in the list of viruses for routine examination in small animal veterinary clinics.",

In the present study, the genomes of five MVC strains were compared. All MVCs have diverged from the common ancestor of bocaviruses and have evolved uniquely in the dog population worldwide (Fig. 1) . A Korean MVC is genetically distant from American and Japanese MVCs especially when the NP1 genes were compared. MVCs may have evolved further within each geographical region (Fig. 2) , but the analysis of more MVC isolates would be necessary to confirm such a conclusion.",

It will be necessary to accumulate further field cases to elucidate the clinical significance of MVC as a canine pathogen. Phylogenetic analysis of MVC strains including the present MVC isolate suggested a possibility of geographically dependent evolution pattern of MVC.",
