It does so by evaluating three dimensions, namely (a) dominant government policy, (b) the pattern of tourism demand and (c) the degree of public participation in the policy making process. Both quantitative and qualitative methodologies are used in a content analysis of 45 related documents. The results indicate that while little relationship existed between the demands of tourism and public policy in both 1999 and 2007, the requirements of social policies and a greater role being attributed to public participation in the policy making were more emphasized in 2007. The theoretical contributions and practical implications of this study are also addressed.",

In China, the greater availability of leisure time in the recent decade has been directly attributed to the country's exponential tourism growth during the same period, especially its domestic tourism flows, which reached over 1.6 billion person times in 2007 (Gao, 2006; Shao, 2008) . When a 'blowout' in tourism demand was witnessed in October 1999, China's central government authorities responded by pushing through a revision of the Regulation on National Festival and Memorial Day Public Holidays that took effect from May 2000. In addition to adding the total number of annual public holidays, in conjunction with executive orders made by the government authorities, the revised regulation facilitated the establishment of three week-long holidays each year by transferring weekend days off from adjacent weekends into the week of public holidays.",

By 2007, the three golden week had already accounted for 1/3 and 40% respectively of annual tourist volumes and tourism receipts in the Chinese domestic tourism market (The China National Tourism Administration (CNTA), 2008). Especially, the vital importance of the golden week was fully appreciated in 2003 when the October golden week completely made up for the considerable losses suffered by tourism businesses during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic which plagued China in the first half of that year (Gao, 2004) . At the same time, the golden week holiday have also become important occasions for Chinese people to engage in outbound tourism activities, thereby expanding the influences of the golden week to the world tourism arena (ACNielsen, 2007) .",

Furthermore, the 2007 revision formally institutionalized the practice of commuting days from adjacent weekends to form week-long holidays. The Ordinance on Paid Vacations for Employees was issued at the same time, entitling employees of all types of organizations in China to annual paid vacations. The detailed differences between the two policies embodied in these two pieces of legislation are listed in the Appendix.",

We focus in particular on a systematic exploration of the political and bureaucratic forces that underpinned the policy changes made in 1999 and 2007. The rationales behind such an exploration are consolidated by both the structural and operational uniqueness of public policy systems in China, and current research paucity in the golden week holiday at large. The specific objectives of the paper include: identifying the major policy demands; investigating the trajectory of bureaucratic competition; and examining the respective policy agenda setting regimes in the formulations of the regulations of the 1999 and 2007 golden week holiday.",

Policy analysis should center around the temporal nature of the whole policy process (Davis et al., 1993) . The paramount status of policy making in the whole policy process has also been recognized (Hall & Jenkins, 1995) . Indeed, those who insist that the policy process is a non-divisible whole often synonymize policy making with the policy process itself (Simon, 1997) . Policy making can be generally be considered as a continuous course of action taken over time that involves many decisions (Anderson, 1976) . Graddy and Ye (2008) divided the policy making mechanism into two temporally ordered stages: first, the triggering events prompting policy making, and second, the contextual components of policy making. With regard to the contextual components of policy making, a wide range of tangible and intangible factors are identified, such as the bureaucratic organizations concerned, which may include legitimate decision-making bodies and influencing institutions, political and bureaucratic leaders, interest groups, the general community, and the characteristics of policy making legacies.",

Such a policy making process can be further disaggregated into the following temporally ordered stages: policy issue identification, policy agenda setting, policy demand prioritization, policy decision planning, and policy output legitimization. This process can be a cyclical integrity that takes into account the ongoing changes to a particular policy over a certain period of time (Hill, 1993) . The Golden Week Holiday System discussed in this paper is just a case in point illustrating such a cyclical process.",

In the second stage of policy agenda setting, policy agenda is defined as the series of policy issues selected by decision makers or regarded by them as pending actions (Cobb & Elder, 1972) . Policy agenda setting necessitates a platform upon which different and often contesting policy demands are presented, deliberated and, finally, prioritized. The later stages of policy planning, adoption and legitimization, in terms of the policy contents determined, retrospectively reflect in either explicit or implicit manners the details of the process of demand prioritization aforementioned. Therefore, given their pivotal roles in deciding what and how the policies are made or changed, the stages of policy agenda setting and policy demand prioritization naturally call for focused attention in public policy research.",

A policy agenda can also be understood as a channel through which policy issues are incorporated into the institutionalized decisionmaking agenda of the government (Zhang, 1992) . Cobb and Elder (1972) identified two types of policy agenda: systematic agendas and government agendas. Systematic agendas are mainly composed of policy issues the general public believes to be pending actions, together with those that have been institutionalized and brought under the government's jurisdiction. Systematic agendas are set at a preliminary stage in the sense that policy issues are generally vaguely framed and sketchy in content or scope, and measures for or solutions to such issues are not necessarily available at this stage. However, government agendas are set at the official stage in which policy issues are heeded by the government through its relevant bureaucratic organizations, sometimes with measures or solutions already drafted.",

Hence, the regime epitomizing the interactions between the government and the public directly influences whether and how systematic agendas are transformed into government agendas (Webler, 1995) . In other words, such a regime indicates the extent of citizen participation during the deliberative process of policy making, which is expected to fulfill such characteristics as procedural fairness and competency in contemporary western democratic societies (Renn, Webler & Wiedemann, 1995) . From the government perspective, Jordan and Richardson (1982) proposed five categories of such a regime, namely sectorization, consultation, exchange, institutionalization of compromise, and clientelism, in descending order of the degree of citizen participation. Sectorization refers to unilateral government demarcation of the general public into isolated sectors for which sector-specific policies are required, while clientelism indicates the paradigm shift in the ideologies underlying institutional arrangements in which government is reduced to a business entity that is little different from any business in the corporate world, both in terms of the interactions between the government and the public and the management of government operations themselves. The remaining three categories of consultation, exchange, and institutionalization are located on a spectrum flanked by the two categories described above.",

Such political influences are often epitomized in the integration of the cultural traditions of certain ethnic groups of a country into its public holidays. Derocco, Dundas and Zimmeman (1996) identified three types of public holidays: political holidays, religious holidays, and secular holidays. While regulations on such public holidays have fallen exclusively within the domain of the state, the second and third branches of vacation policy, regulations on weekly working hours and those on paid holidays, have resulted from struggles for social rights fought between a variety of social groups, most significantly workers, as represented by unions, and business owners (Richards, 1999) .",

            "text": "Esping- Anderson (1990) categorizes modern day Western societies that feature weekly working hours and paid holiday arrangements as part of the social welfare system into three types: liberal welfare states, corporatist welfare states, and social democratic states. Liberal welfare states such as the USA, Canada, Australia, and Japan, seldom intervene in social welfare arrangements between employers and workers, and given the low level of unionism in such countries, employers often take advantage in bargaining over employment conditions. Corporatist welfare states encompass most Western European countries, where collective bargaining and state intervention are closely related to the extent that there is a pattern of the former raising demands beyond statutory minima followed by fresh legislation ensuring universal coverage (Green & Potepan, 1988) . While Great Britain is an exception here with no legislation on minimum standards, unions have been strong advocates for leisure time arrangements (Gao, 2007) . Social democratic states, including Scandinavian countries and The Netherlands, are most tilted toward institutionalized government involvement in vacation policies, with periodic legislative formalization observed. At the same time, the activeness of government in welfare regulations in such societies is also believed to be strongly influenced by the ideologies of the ruling political party (Samuel, 1993) . For instance, comprehensive labor welfare regulations were witnessed in France during the sporadic periods in which the government was controlled by socialist parties from the 1930s to the 1970s. The first French regulations on paid annual holidays were implemented in 1936 when a five-day working week regime was introduced. International organizations, with the ILO in particular taking center stage, have also had a significant influence on vacation polices, although some of their provisions are not binding on member states (Gao, 2006) . The governments of socialist countries in Eastern Europe, as the embodiment of a political ruling class of the proletariat, have played a proactive role in formulating vacation policies (Hall, 1994) .",

All these documents have emphasized the legitimate right of individuals to a reasonable amount of leisure time and the importance of such leisure time to the promotion of tourism development.

However, little research has examined the driving force behind this systemdthe Chinese government. China has endeavored to establish a socialist market economy over the past three decades, and the Chinese government, with a uniquely centralized party-state dualism, a largely internally driven policy making model, and a highly centralized bureaucracy, is still believed to exercise firm control over the trajectory of the majority of social and economic phenomena in the country (Chao & Dickson, 2001; Zhang et al., 2005) . The golden week holiday are no exception. The Chinese government's move to commute days from adjacent weekends and form week-long holidays is an example of the considerable executive leverage it has. This type of executive power has only been seen sporadically in countries such as France, Brazil, and Japan several decades ago (Samuel, 1993) . In addition, policy making in the golden week holiday has been unique because of the relative instability of the policy subsystem of the golden week holiday, with dynamic shifts in the structure and interactions of the components both outside and within the Chinese bureaucracy. Actually, as the paper is being written, hot debates are being conducted over further policy changes to the golden week holiday system. Therefore, any academic investigation into the golden week phenomenon, involving as it does the synchronized activities of over one billion people, must include an examination of the roles of relevant government bodies and their policies. Given the relative paucity of prior studies in this area, this paper aims to fill this research void through a comparative identification and evaluation of the key dimensions of the policy making mechanisms for the golden week holiday system in 1999 and 2007, respectively.",

Fig. 1 shows that the bureaucratic organization empowered to make policy on the golden week holiday system is the State Council of China, China's equivalent to a central government cabinet. The China National Tourism Administration (CNTA) is one of the stakeholder bureaucratic departments involved in the policy making process and represents tourism-related interests. The other departments involved in this process, which are not listed in Fig. 1 due to the research objectives of this study, include a variety of agencies such as the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the Ministry of Transportation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Public Security, and the State Administration of Work Safety. This paper is an explanatory study with a primary research objective of describing the respective policy making mechanisms the State Council used for the golden week holiday system in 1999 and 2007. The main research question for this study is as follows: how were the 1999 and 2007 golden week holiday system policies made? Corresponding to the afore-reviewed literature on the pivotal stages of policy agenda setting and policy demand prioritization in the policy making process, the primary research objective can be further divided into the following three specific objectives: (1) to investigate the respective policy inputs in terms of the major policy demands of the two policies; (2) to explore the extent of bureaucratic competition in terms of the weight of tourism-related policy demands when each of the two policies were formulated; and (3) to examine the respective policy agenda setting regimes in terms of the level of civil participation in formulating the two policies.",

The second research objective addresses the 'noisy' tourism policy arena in which, due to the complexity of the tourism industry, there are a number of diverse competing interests (Jeffries, 2001) . Finally, to assess the nature of policy agenda setting for what is a social phenomenon in contemporary China in a social context that is currently in the 'primary stage of socialism' and undergoing a fundamental transformation into a socialist market economy, the third research objective is intended to explore either consistency with or deviation from existing theoretical elaborations, most of which characterize Chinese public policy agenda setting in general as largely internally driven because of a distinct party-state dualism and a highly centralized bureaucracy (Wu, 2005) .",

Content analysis refers to the systematic analysis of textual data already coded for pattern and structure examination and confirmation, category development, and aggregation into perceptible constructs (Gray & Densten, 1998; Insch & Moore, 1997) . One of the unique benefits of content analysis is its compatibility with both qualitative and quantitative methods, in that it is capable of capturing a richer sense of the concepts expressed within the data due to its qualitative basis, and, at the same time, classifying words into content categories on a quantitative basis, which is why content analysis is also described as a form of contingency analysis in which content categories are extracted and the number of times a theme appears in the text counted (Roberts, 2000; Weber, 1985) . Content analysis has been intensively applied in public policy research, and its merits in the tourism realm have been gradually appreciated in recent years, which is partly attributed to the proliferation of internet-based contents as research data sources (Hall & Valentin, 2005) . By far, The tourism discipline has witnessed the successful and convincing utilizations of content analysis in such fields as the effects of tourism advertising materials and campaigns (Henderson, 2003) , image building of tourism destinations (Sirakaya & Soenmez, 2000; Zhang & Cameron, 2003) , variations in conceptual understandings in tourism (Cloke & Perkins, 2002; Garrod, 2003) , and the perceptions of tourism from the perspectives of the tourists (Chen et al., 2001; Yagi, 2001) .",

Cross-coder assessment refers to the utilization of more than one coder in coding the same content independently before establishing inter-coder reliability for the adoption of the coded units of analysis (Neuendorf, 2002) . Two of the authors of this study first coded the research materials on an independent basis before comparing and assessing the separate codings. Prior evidence (McBeth, Shanahan, Arnell, & Hathaway, 2007) has shown that inter-coder reliability can be established when more than 80% of the codings can be agreed upon. Altogether, the two coders initially agreed on 86%, 82%, and 91% of the codings for each of the three respective research objectives, thereby establishing an acceptable level of inter-coder reliability. For codings in which discrepancies arose, discussions were held until a consensus was reached and all codings were approved. The principles of constant comparative analysis were also observed to reify the inductive approaches adopted in this study to extract new concepts and relationships (Jennings, 2001) .",

This ranking indicates that the tourism industry was not singled out as a key field for stimulating domestic consumption in the 1999 policy making process.

Specifically, the 'from the government' category included meetings held within central bureaucratic organizations or participated in by officials from other ministerial departments and provincial authorities. Feedback from official research organizations was also classified as 'from the government'. Public input was mainly made via public hearings, forums, and discussions in which all elements of Chinese society were invited to participate. In recognition of the peculiarities of the Chinese political system, deliberations at the National People's Congress (NPC), the Chinese national parliament, were deemed to be 'from the government', while discussions held at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), an advisory institution mainly composed of social identities, were deemed to be 'from the public'. Table 5 illustrates the correlation between text units on the interaction between government and society in 1999 and 2007. Table 5 shows that input from the public was of moderate significance to the policy making process on golden week holiday in 2007 (x 2 [d.f. \u00bc 1] \u00bc 4.214, p < 0.05), in which public deliberations accounted for 35% of the total. The odds ratio for 'from the public' in the 2007 policy making process was 3.949, indicating that public input was about four times as likely as government input to be considered in the 2007 policy making process.",

            "text": "However, the 2007 regime can be defined as one of 'consultation' for the three following reasons. First, the 2007 policy making process took place over a longer period in which a series of both institutionalized and non-institutionalized government consultation channels such as the CPPCC, research teams from universities, international experience, and a wider array of representative enterprises, including privately owned firms, played a role. A draft version of the 2007 policy was issued for public comment around twenty days before formal publication of the final policy, although it was later shown that the draft and the final policy were exactly the same. Second, a series of studies based on modern technology such as the Internet and telephone polls were employed in an effort to solicit opinion from the general public, with one survey being conducted after publication of the draft 2007 policy. The data collection methods used for these surveys ensured wider public participation and thus popular control over the policy issue under discussion. Therefore, we are justified in advancing the characterization of the 2007 process from the sectorization label we give to the 1999 policy formulation exercise. Our third reason is that while the 2007 policy making process was more open in terms of interaction between the government and society, there seems to be no indication that a culture of consultation has been institutionalized to such an extent that an exchange regime has been established for future policy making. In particular, the public consultation process undertaken in 2007 did not include any input from interest groups from the business, trade or social welfare realms. Therefore, taking account of the qualified significance of public submissions made during the 2007 policy making process, as shown by the Chi-Square test described above, the 2007 regime is best characterized as a consultation process that represents some degree of progress from the sectorization approach adopted in 1999, but not much more.",

Our findings both echo existing theoretical elaborations and explain Chinese peculiarities. First, the findings corresponding to the first research objective, for which the results demonstrate a significant change in the dominant policy demands taken into account in the respective policy making processes undertaken in 1999 and 2007, consolidate theoretical discussions on policy change that analogize the policy process as a dynamic equilibrium with policy punctuations being the norm rather than the exception (Baumgartner & Jones, 1993; Sabatier & Jenkins-Smith, 1993) . Meanwhile, classical theoretical discourses designate policy changes as responses to the occurrence of abrupt major incidents known as potential focusing events (PFEs) (Birkland, 1997) . However, the policy change observed in this study seems to have been influenced by a cohort of complex and sometimes competing demands which were triggered not only by a number of PFEs, but also by factors of a more incremental nature. Such a complex group of forces influencing policy change may be accounted for by the Chinese leadership's traditional emphasis on 'gradual and prudent decision making' (Wu, 2005, p. 67) . Future studies on the policy making mechanisms for other social phenomena may provide further evidence confirming this view or result in complementary insights.",

This policy punctuation, which was shaped by shifting policy demands, can be better comprehended through a deeper inquiry into the contextual transformations seen in the wider Chinese policy environment during the time span for our study. It seems that the ideological vicissitudes undergone in Chinese society from 1999 to 2007 convincingly account for the shift from economic demands to social ones in golden week policy making. Ideological stipulations legitimize the intellectual and emotional pressures for change to the current social system (Cameron, 1978) , and Chinese society has long been framed by and responsive to the guiding political ideologies of the Communist Party of China (CPC) (Li, 2006) . The 1999 policy was formulated under the ideological context of Deng Xiaoping Theory, which emphasized the core status of economic construction (Jiang, 1997) ; economic demands thus overwhelmed social considerations in the 1999 policy formulation process.",

The new discourses, while still stressing the importance of economic construction, further require that people's well-being be placed at the core, and stress the comprehensive, balanced, and sustainable development of 'a harmonious socialist society' as reflected by allround improvements in Chinese people's quality of life (Hu, 2007) . As Table 2 shows, such people-oriented approaches are conspicuous in the social demand sub-categories for the 2007 policy, such as promoting traditional Chinese culture, realizing human rights to leisure time, and learning from international practice. Furthermore, even the economic considerations taken into account for the 2007 policy make reference to sustainability values such as balanced development and equal opportunity. What is particularly worth noting here is the specific timing of the promulgation of the 2007 policydDecember 2007, which was only one month after the convention of the 17th National Congress of the CPC, where the 'scientific outlook on development' ideology was formally proposed. This short interval may have been emblematic of the considerable and immediate impact of ideological shifts on the legitimacy of the policy changes made in the 2007 regulation. Finally, the 'scientific outlook on development' approach is still seen as an integral advance based on Deng Xiaoping Theory; such ideological harmony may have accounted for the partial policy changes made in 2007 whereby the May Day golden week was abolished and the other two golden week retained.",

What is more, the tourism industry took much of the blame for the negative effects of the golden week in the 2007 policy formulation process. Existing theoretical elaborations attribute the muted voice of tourism in public policy making to the inherent features of the tourism industry, with a dispersed and diffuse set of stakeholders which makes it difficult for the formation of synchronized industrial representations in the political spectrum (Jeffries, 2001) . In addition, the current ideological ethos in many developed countries in which the tourism industry is regarded as an industry that suits self-regulation in a market economy have biased official attitudes toward tourism policies (Goeldner & Ritchie, 2003) . The bureaucratic roles of many national tourism administrations in such countries have been substantially blurred, as such organizations have been reformed into entities operated like public enterprises (Mill & Morrison, 1998) .",

The deputy-ministerial rank of the China National Tourism Administration (CNTA) under the Chinese central government was also a factor in the low degree of influence the CNTA has in policy making on golden week. For instance, in addition to the CNTA, there are 13 ministerial departments that have jurisdiction over the administration of tourist attractions in China (Zhang et al., 2005) , and it has been admitted that across the whole Chinese tourism industry, only the hotel and travel agency sectors are within the exclusive realm of the CNTA (Gao, 2006) . Nevertheless, it is particularly ironic that the findings of this study show that a strange mix of tourism policy has been observed: tourism concerns were not meant to occupy the central stage in the 1999 policy making process, yet the 1999 policy was retrospectively bestowed with the splendid title of 'the golden week', mostly because of their effect in stimulating Chinese domestic and outbound tourism. The changes made to the policy in 2007, as embodied in the abolition of the May Day golden week, were partly stimulated by the public angst about the negative tourism impact the policy had had, notwithstanding the supportive stance of the CNTA in lobbying for the retention of the 1999 policy. This shows the pronounced contrast between the considerable weight attached to and debate over tourismrelated policies among the general public on one hand, and the limited leverage of the tourism authorities within the Chinese bureaucracy on the other. With soaring demand for travel among the Chinese people as a result of sustained economic growth, it remains to be seen whether such a gap will induce a fundamental transformation of the Chinese tourism policy arena, and more research on this point would be worthwhile and insightful, especially if the role played by the CNTA in other Chinese tourism policy issues is investigated on comparative and longitudinal bases.",

Our results show that the Chinese government, with its unique system of centralized party-state dualism in public governance matters, became more willing to bring other policy actors or interested parties into the policy making process in 2007. This study, which examines an isolated case, also demonstrates that such an 'opening-up' of the policy making process is still carried out on quite a limited and well-controlled basis. This indicates that further empirical studies should be carried out to ascertain whether this new consultation model can remain stable or even become institutionalized as the policy making mechanism for other social phenomena in China. Further research is also merited into whether the consultation regime discussed here can undergo additional paradigm shifts along the theoretical scale outlined above, recognizing the general trend toward deeper economic liberalization in China as a socialist market economy is established. Looming together with this prospect is the integration into this regime of emerging vested interests in an organized form in China, whose existence and legitimacy have been only ambiguously recognized by the Chinese authorities (Liu, 2006) . Nevertheless, in the Western context, interest groups are believed to be on the cusp of assuming greater power to influence citizen participation models in the deliberative process of public policy making (Ellison, 1998) . Interest groups in Western contexts have been particularly sophisticated in affecting public policy making and have been accounted for by structures like the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) and policy networks (Ellison, 1998; Sabatier & Jenkins-Smith, 1999; Tyler & Dinan, 2001) . Further research aimed at tracking the development of organized interest groups in China and their function in the formulation of Chinese public policy would provide for interesting insights.",

First, on the specific research methodologies employed in this study, despite the efforts of the authors during the analysis stage, content analysis has long been criticized for its neglect of semantic structure, inflation of the theme count, and lack of sensitivity (Neuendorf, 2002) . Also, due to time, financial and social network constraints, the limited access possessed by the authors to data sources for this study may have undermined the validity of the research results. While the amounts of text units out of the 45 collected documents have been deemed sufficient pursuant to the research purposes of this study, the validity of the research results of this study would be greatly enhanced if more primary research resources could be secured. In addition, the lack of established criteria for evaluating research objective 3 may have weakened the subjective conclusions reached by the authors. Thus, the research design required the use of more rigorous research methodologies that could better accommodate the research objectives and more credible data sources. Third, with regard to the conceptual framework for the study, taking into account the growing influence of external factors on the Chinese policy subsystem, which has been undergoing a fundamental transformation with the deepening of the reform and opening-up of the economy and the establishment of a socialist market economy, the introduction and due investigation of foreign components may further complement the existing framework by giving a more comprehensive picture of contemporary Chinese policy making, especially the 2007 mechanism. Finally, in response to the call for policy analysis from a panoramic perspective, research undertaken on a more extended longitudinal basis that covers the policy implementation stage will surely help develop a more thorough understanding of the Chinese policy making mechanism.",

This study, by examining the respective golden week holiday policy making mechanisms adopted in 1999 and 2007, contributes to the building of theory on the mechanism for public policy changes in the Chinese context, demonstrating both consistency with existing theoretical elaborations and unique Chinese characteristics. In particular, given that the golden week debate remains contentious, even after the policy process undertaken in 2007, the three dimensions identified by this study may lay a tenable foundation for studies on future golden week holiday policy changes. Second, this study complements current research on tourism policies, particularly due to its confirmation of the comparatively muted voice of tourism interests in public policy issues, even where the tourism stakes are high. The tourism dimensions of the golden week policy making mechanisms used in the two years examined played only a peripheral role in the policy changes effected. This study may have significant implications for tourism authorities in other developing countries that are reliant on tourism development to balance tourism priorities with other competing interests in initiating relevant policies.",
