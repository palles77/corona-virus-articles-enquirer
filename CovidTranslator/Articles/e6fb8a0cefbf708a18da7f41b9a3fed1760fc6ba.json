Methods: Fifty participants performed IARM and CDC-recommended gown removal methods to remove 3 types of PPC (ie, cotton gown, water resistant gown, and plastic apron) in random order at 2 separate sessions after applying Glo Germ simulated germ lotion on the gown's surface. A video demonstrating the CDC-recommended gown removal method was shown between the 2 sessions. After PPC removal, fluorescent stains were counted by an ultraviolet scan under dim light. Results: Following IARM, contaminants were splashed in the surroundings, particularly on the front part of the subject. The plastic apron and cotton gown obtained the highest and lowest contaminative hazards, respectively, to the hands, shoes, and environment. Females, nurses, and senior staff had serious hand or shoe contamination. The CDC removal method more significantly reduced body and environmental contamination of small fluorescent stains (<1 cm 2 ), but not of large patches (>1 cm 2 ), than IARM. Conclusion: The effect of gown removal, PPC type, discarding PPC location, training of infection control measures, hand hygiene, and special work shoes should be considered daily.",

Zamora et al examined the selfcontamination rates when removing 2 personal protective systems and found that the anterior neck, forearms, wrists, and hands were the likeliest zones for contamination. 8 Similarly, Wong et al 9 conducted a simulated viral load test and observed contamination sites on the subjects' face, dorsum and palm, and trunk. These studies mainly focused on the body self-contamination rates. However, environmental contamination levels during PPE removal were not known. Our recent study examined both body contamination rates and environmental contamination levels and revealed that the front part of the subject and the rubbish bin were contaminated during the removal of latex gloves. 10 However, the study did not involve personal protective gown.",

Wong et al 9 found that the physical material properties of these gowns differ and suggested that the traditional surgical woven gown absorbs liquid contaminants, whereas the nonwoven gown resists them. However, no concrete evidence indicates the level of contamination of the environment and body caused by different methods of removal of different types of PPC. Considering that, until present time, studies about both body contamination rates and environmental contamination levels, and 2 methods during removal of different types of PPC have not been very full-scale, the present study aimed to examine the body contamination rates and environmental contamination levels during 2 different methods (IARM and CDCrecommended gown removal method) of removing 3 types of PPC (cotton gown, water-resistant gown, and plastic apron). We hypothesized that (1) IARM and CDC-recommended gown removal methods have different effects on body contamination rates and environmental contamination levels; (2) a significant difference in contamination levels during the removal of the 3 types of protective clothing can be observed between the 2 removal methods; and (3) reduced environmental and bodily contaminations are associated with the CDC-recommended gown removal method.",

The removal method is a significant factor in contamination; thus, choosing a suitable location is important. For instance, removal should not be conducted in front of patients, in nursing station areas, or in areas where medical equipment are stored. The effect of removal should not be underestimated, and, thus, removing the isolation gown or apron arbitrarily, without following proper procedures, such as by forcefully peeling off the gown or plastic apron, should be avoided. Rather, removal should be performed at the designated gown down area.",

This fact is particularly true with the Plastic apron (PPC3) had a higher chance of contaminating the environment than PPC1 and PPC2. Because plastic had the lowest water-absorbing properties, the droplets that cannot be absorbed by the surface of the plastic might then drop to the floor or spread to the surrounding area, which especially increased contamination with large patches in the CDC removal method.

The other gown (nonwoven gown) can resist the absorption of liquid contaminants when the covered area is sufficient and thus provides better physical barrier protection than the woven gown. However, the nonwoven gown has weak liquid absorption ability. The liquid contaminant may easily drop to the floor or splash to the surrounding environment during movement. More important, an extra force added to the movement, such as by pulling off the isolation gown without unfastening the ties, tearing off the plastic apron, or removing the gown or apron forcefully, spreads droplet contaminants that can splash not only to the surrounding environment but also to nearby patients. Therefore, determining the type of isolation gown to use is important. The present results suggest that double gowns with outer absorbent cotton reduce the spread of contaminants to the environment, whereas inner water repellency gowns can resist contaminants and prevent them from penetrating into underwear and even the skin, providing better protection than a single gown in preventing HCW from coming into contact with patients' blood and body fluids during surgery and other splashing procedures. Although the gowns made from different materials had different characteristics, on the whole, the CDC removal method significantly reduced bodily and environmental contamination.",

Thus, conducting an experimental study to generate potential data to compare the CDC-recommended method of gown removal with IARM for their level of environmental contamination during procedures is necessary. The results of this study support the notion that the CDC-recommended gown removal method has less impact on environment and bodily contamination (ie, on the hands, shoes, and uniform of the subject). Our results verify the 3 hypotheses presented in the introduction. In summary, when the isolation gown or apron is removed following IARM, the hands, uniforms, and shoes of HCWs, as well as the environment, can be contaminated. The plastic apron and cotton gown carried the highest and lowest contaminative hazards. The CDC-recommended gown removal method can reduce environmental and bodily contaminations. Our findings underscore the importance of the method as follows: (1) choose a proper location when discarding used PPC; (2) following the appropriate procedures for removing PPE; (3) proper PPC is to be selected; (4) proper training and supervision for HCWs in infection control measures should be in place; (5) wash the hands immediately after removal procedures; and (6) separate daily shoes from working shoes, and these shoes should not be mixed with uniform and other belongings in personal lockers.",
