A parallel commitment to education and training in this field is needed to prepare the next generation of scientists. The scientific bases, advances, applications, interpretations, and lessons learned by those who have been intimately involved in the early years of microbial forensics need to be documented and transferred to the next generation of scientists and decision makers so that society can be better protected from potential harm resulting from acts of bioterrorism and biocrime. An understanding of the microbial forensic field is essential to determining what evidence is collected, what proper and safe methods of collection and preservation to employ, how the evidence is analyzed, what the significance of a result is, and what is supportive in identifying a perpetrator for prosecution. Thus, the burgeoning field of microbial forensics should be accompanied by a concomitant development of educational infrastructure and resources targeted at the next generation of practitioners, as well as diverse elements for the policy, research, and law enforcement communities.",

It can be broad, providing information encompassing all aspects of the field from science to policy, or more focused. On one end of the target audience spectrum is the student at an academic institution who desires to enter into the discipline of microbial forensics and would like to be well prepared for a career choice. Students following a broad academic education and training pathway have many options. They may, for example, (1) become forensic scientists analyzing crime scene evidence for law enforcement or intelligence agencies; (2) work as a research scientist in a government laboratory such as the CDC, FBI, USDA, or EPA; (3) work as a scientist in an industrial or commercial setting; or (4) enter graduate school toward a career in academia. Alternatively, the student may become an investigator who employs traditional law enforcement approaches with the most effective evidentiary documentation, collection, and preservation techniques merged with those of epidemiology for attribution purposes or crime investigation (Budowle et al., 2007 ). An individual may become a law enforcement official whose responsibility is to understand the scope of an investigation and what tools are available to generate investigative leads. Policy makers must have a general understanding of microbial forensic results, keep abreast of technological and analytical advances, and develop better appreciation of their implications to effect sound and defensible policy decisions. Finally, an important group that informs the public and government is the news media. They are frequently the primary interface between the scientist and the public, publishing and reporting their observations, insights, or inaccuracies of great importance and impact. Social media avenues have dramatically increased the speed with which news stories, factual or erroneous, are promulgated to the public. Educational efforts will better prepare such individuals to be informed and responsible and must be varied in depth and scope to match the target audience of various entities involved in microbial forensics.",

However, there are academic programs in microbiology, molecular biology, and forensic science, and related topics, with affiliated courses and training opportunities that provide avenues and strategies for the preparation of students. Additionally, a full academic program likely is not practical for working professionals; more abbreviated educational/training activities, similar to that of a continuing education course format, could be very effective at integrating professionals into the microbial forensic discipline. Microbiologists, epidemiologists, public health, and law enforcement officials are highly trained in relevant aspects of microbial forensics but may need additional training to integrate effectively their expertise with the demands of this new discipline. Shorter courses or symposia will be useful for expanding the knowledge base of trained professionals. To broadly educate and to specifically educate those involved in the widely varied aspects of microbial forensics represents an educational challenge that must be met to develop the experts and expertise that we desperately need to combat bioterrorism and biocrime. Microbiology, epidemiology, and forensic science education are all at the heart of this field. Program directors, educators, and trainers may review the recommendations and resources from academic, government, and professional organizations in these and related areas. For example, the American Society of Microbiology (ASM) Education Board on microbiology education (asm) has developed and published many educational resources that may be useful for developing training strategies. The ASM proposed a document on Vision and Change in microbiology education (vision and change) with five recommended overarching microbiology curriculum concepts: (1) Evolution;",

It is the same as other forensic disciplines except for its focus on a particular type of crime (Budowle et al., 2003; Carter et al., 2017) . Based on past history and with current technology capabilities, the potential use of biological weapons is greater than at any other time in history. Only a few semiexpert individuals are needed with access to dual-use equipment (e.g., equipment used in the pharmaceutical or food industries) to produce bioweapons inexpensively. These bioweapons will contain signatures that might be exploited to help identify the perpetrators. One may consider attribution solely to be the \"DNA fingerprinting\" of a pathogenic agent, but unique genomic identification of a microorganism may not always be possible because of the clonal nature of many microorganisms and, on a case-by-case basis, lack of population and phylogenetic data.",

Our competitiveness and national success depend on our students' science aptitude (edsource). National Science Teachers Association teachers point to lack of student motivation as a major concern in US science education (news). The need for a new approach to improve science and math education is compelling and well supported. In the American Academy for the Advancement of Science Project 2061, \"just doing more science was not the answer\" (project 2061). Current methods put more value on learning correct answers versus exploration, collaboration, and inquiry. They recommend \"practices where the learning of science is as much about the process as the result or outcome, and where students can ask questions and are actively engaged in the learning process, refocusing student learning from knowledge and comprehension to application and analysis.\" (project 2061). Inquiry is \"central to science learning\" as students develop their understanding of science concepts combining knowledge, reasoning, and thinking while enhancing comprehension through hands-on learning. The National Research Council agrees. They state \"effective instruction capitalizes on students' early interest and experiences, identifies and builds on what they know, and provides them with experiences that serve to engage them in the practices of science and sustain their interest\" (NRC, 2011).",

The field provides a good example where application of newer technologies may help overcome many of the same problems encountered with traditional epidemiology with respect to study design and interpretation (4). Molecular tools can be employed to characterize and potentially individualize samples and isolates to address forensically relevant questions. This subdivision of epidemiology has special importance in microbial forensics because it is desirable to determine the source of a particular microbe used in a crime. Highly discriminating assays can precisely identify strains and isolates, resulting in a more focused and effective investigation. These types of data could associate a sample with a single geographic area, even possibly a particular laboratory or flask, or with the specific conditions and nutrients used to culture the microorganism.

Depending on the nature of the crime, there may be multiple crime scenes requiring different sets of skills, knowledge, equipment, and abilities (see Chapters 21 and 22 for more details). Once the crime scene(s) has (have) been identified and delimited, a plan is needed to properly collect and maintain integrity of the evidence that may be subsequently analyzed. Practices are needed to maintain the integrity and that minimize contamination of the evidence. The handling and storage of evidence is integral to minimizing degradation of the target analytes. Microbial contamination may be somewhat different from other types of contamination because the contaminating organisms can replicate thus confounding results. The nuances of a microbial forensic investigation add a layer on top of traditional crime scene investigations, particularly because of the hazardous nature of the evidence. The need for proper documentation may seem obvious but it is a very important part of maintaining the integrity of the evidence. Crime scenes are chaotic and missteps can occur. To minimize missteps in handling documentation procedures should be established so the crime scene can be reconstructed at a later date for investigators or in a court of law. It is likely that biocrimes and acts of bioterrorism will add another dimension of complexity because (i) there is less experience in crime scene collection due to (fortunately) fewer cases, (ii) addressing the safety of victims will not be trivial, (iii) investigators will be wearing cumbersome but absolutely necessary personal protective equipment (PPE), (iv) the best approaches for collection and preservation of evidence may have to be determined at the scene given the limited extant information available, and (v) the response to biocrime events by using forensic science in an attribution involves a complex interplay among science, policy, law, law enforcement, public health, medical, and media communities (bioattribution) and may require several different areas of expertise and authority. This aggregation of diverse disciplines and professions, \"brought together to develop an understanding and action plan in response to a suspicious event\" is challenging in a domestic context, and even more formidable if an event has global implications (Bidwell et al., 2016) . The historical knowledge of experts intimately involved in past events and their understanding of the dynamics of the interplay of scienceelawe bureaucracyemedia are pivotal in developing effective and efficient responses for future attribution determinations as well as in the training of our students. Thus, crime scene investigation, safety, PPE, collection, chain of custody, and sharing important past casework experiences and examples of how to manage the interplay of the different disciplines and professionals should be included as essential parts of any curriculum.",

While most approaches focus on collection tools, it is very important to consider sampling strategies to obtain the most relevant data, which involves strategic planning, logistics, and statistics. Conditions that are proper for collection and/or preservation of one microbe may be deleterious for another and, for that matter, to traditional forensic materials such as human DNA, fingerprints, and trace materials. For example, foodborne pathogens are particularly vexing; conditions that are intended to preserve the material may promote growth of natural bacteria in a food product, and this overgrowth may destroy or obscure the initial bioweapon. Tools for collection need to be validated for efficient collection and for determining that they do not react with the target of interest. Tools developed for powder collection may be inefficient or ineffective for collecting plant material. Sample collection is not trivial and requires substantial consideration. Issues related to the practices of sample collection, handling, transportation, and storage of microbes in the investigation of biocrimes and guidelines for the collection of evidence by physicians and medical personnel from potential victims of bioterrorism have been published and are valuable for education and training programs .",

The rapid expansion of sequencing capabilities, where sequencing some microbes within a day at very deep coverage, has raised the importance of genetic identification. It will likely be a mainstay of the microbial forensic investigation of any attack with any microbe. The cost of wholegenome sequencing has decreased at least 100fold in just a few years. This technology has now matured into one of the methods of choice to examine the genetic structure of a particular pathogen and to identify signatures of forensic relevance.

Evidence can be any material, physical or electronic, that can associate or exclude individuals, victim, and/or suspect with a crime. It typically comprises materials specific to the crime as well as control samples for background information. Types of evidence may be fingerprints, blood, semen, saliva, hair, fibers, documents, photos, computer files, videos, firearms, glass, metals, plastics, paint, powders, explosives, tool marks, and soil.

Studies of case histories are instructive because they provide analysis of information in the relevant context, including real complexities. The study of a variety of incidents can be tailored to the particular group learning about them (see Chapters 1, 3, 10, 17 and 39). The Amerithrax case is likely to be studied for years by many different groups ranging from scientists to law enforcement to lawyers. In addition to this case, many other cases are described in chapters of this book and the previous edition , as well as in specific publications (Seth Carus, 1998) ]. Among these threats are foodborne illnesses from bacteria, such as Shigella and Salmonella, and toxins such as ricin. In addition, there have been events involving agriculture, including a foot-and-mouth outbreaks in the United Kingdom (Jamal and Belsham, 2013) and mad cow disease in the United States (Sigurdson et al., 2018) . Environmental contamination is also an area of interest (Yates et al., 2016; Cano and Toranzos, 2018) , such as microbial source tracking to detect water contamination by human sewage (see Chapters 6 and 7) or animal farming such as by the poultry industry in Arkansas. Perhaps the most common area where issues of natural versus intentional events arise is related to emerging infections. This question has arisen with the outbreaks of influenza H1N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome, monkeypox, and specific cases of HIV infection (Jester et al., 2018; Lucas and Nelson, 2015; Morand et al., 2017) .",

These standards need to be known and appreciated so that admissibility of evidence can be achieved. The government will use microbial forensic scientists and other experts, their results, the scientific literature, and supporting validation studies to support its position. The defense will defend its client vigorously to attempt to achieve an acquittal.
