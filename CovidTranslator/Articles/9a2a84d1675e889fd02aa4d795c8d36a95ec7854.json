            "text": "Glycyrrhiza glabra L. has become an endangered medicinal plant due to the unabated extraction of glycyrrhizin. Glycyrrhizin is a triterpenoid saponin that is a root centric secondary metabolite having numerous pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antiallergic, antiulcer, and is found to be effective even against HIV. Harvesting of the roots for high value glycyrrhizin destroys the whole plant causing existential threat to the plant itself and consequent damage to biodiversity. The present study establishes that hairy root cultures of G. glabra, using an optimized elicitor, can dramatically enhance focused production of glycyrrhizin at a much faster pace year-round without causing destruction of the plant. Hairy root cultures of G. glabra were developed using the Agrobacterium rhizogenes A4 strain. The glycyrrhizin content was enhanced using different biotic and abiotic elicitors, for example, PEG (polyethylene glycol), CdCl 2 , cellulase, and mannan at different concentrations and durations. PEG at 1% concentration enhanced the yield of glycyrrhizin up to 5.4fold after 24 h of exposure, whereas 200 \u00b5g mL \u22121 cellulase enhanced glycyrrhizin yield to 8.6-fold after 7 days of treatment. Mannan at 10 mg L \u22121 concentration enhanced the production of glycyrrhizin up to 7.8-fold after 10 days of stress. Among different antioxidant enzymes, SOD activity was significantly enhanced under drought, cellulase and mannan stress. This identification of elicitors can result in abundant supply of valuable glycyrrhizin to meet broad spectrum demand through commercial production without endangering G. glabra L.",

It is also effective against HIV (Ito et al. 1987 (Ito et al. , 1988 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) like viruses (Nasrollahi et al. 2014) . Glycyrrhizin is used globally as a flavoring agent, natural sweetener, and preservative as well. It is effectively used in the treatment of menstrual cramps, menopause symptoms, dropsy, fever, irritated urinary and respiratory passages, hypoglycemia, and influenza. Glycyrrhizin is also used as a diuretic, demulcent, emollient, antispasmodic, expectorant, mild laxative, and as a cough remedy (Alam et al. 2017) . The overall demand of glycyrrhizin, which stood at US$ 1.70 bn in 2016, is anticipated to reach US$ 2.3 bn by 2025 (https ://www.trans paren cymar ketre searc h.com/licor ice-extra cts-marke t.html).",

Previously, a slow growth method for conservation of G. glabra germplasm was established and was being maintained in the host institute (Srivastava et al. 2013) . As an alternative source, hairy root cultures of licorice were established which provide constant high production of glycyrrhizin while maintaining its stable nature for longer time periods (Tenea et al. 2008) . Hairy roots synthesize bioactive compounds that are similar or even higher in quantity as compared to normal root cultures (Agostini 1 3 et al. 2013) . These roots are genetically modified roots and also cost effective due to the requirement of hormone-free medium for their growth and proliferation (Ba\u00edza et al. 1999; Lu et al. 2008; Hussain et al. 2012) . Agrobacterium rhizogenes, a soil-borne bacterium, facilitates hairy root induction (Thwe et al. 2016 ).

Leaves from in vitro-grown shoots at three different stages, that is, very young, 2-3 weeks-old and more than 4-weeks-old were used for transformation. Prior to 2 days of transformation, these leaves were excised and pre-cultured on \u00bd MS solid medium. A single colony from the A. rhizogenes A4 strain was picked up and cultured on liquid YMB medium at 28 \u00b0C for 16-18 h at 220 rpm. Bacterial cells (OD 600 = 0.6) were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm. For re-suspending the pellets, MS liquid medium with MES buffer and 100 \u00b5M acetosyringone was used. The medium was incubated at 28 \u00b0C at 100-150 rpm for at least 1 h. Precultured leaf sections were pierced with a needle and immersed in infection medium for 20-30 min with gentle hand shaking or on a rotary shaker at 70 rpm. Leaf sections immersed in sterile water were also placed under similar conditions to serve as control. Infected leaves were blotted dry on sterile filter paper and placed on cocultivation medium containing 100 mM acetosyringone for 2-3 days in a dark room at 28 \u00b0C. After co-cultivation, leaves were washed with sterilized water containing cefotaxime (250 mg L \u22121 ), placed on \u00bd MS or full MS medium supplemented with cefotaxime (250 mg L \u22121 ) but without growth hormones. After emergence of putative hairy roots, approximately 3-4 cm long roots were cut and subcultured on separate medium. The concentration of antibiotic was decreased after every subculture and finally omitted prior to transfer in a liquid medium. Full grown hairy roots were transferred to 250 mL flask and placed on a rotary shaker under continuous agitation at 80 rpm and incubated at 25 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C with a 16 h light/8 h dark period.",

A five-fold enhancement has been observed in glycyrrhizin content in hairy roots in comparison to control roots. Expressions of HMGR, SQS, FPPS, bAS and CYP88D6 genes were higher in hairy roots. This high expression of important genes of the glycyrrhizin biosynthetic pathway was supported by a high yield of glycyrrhizin in hairy roots. Production of secondary metabolites and expression of their corresponding biosynthetic genes have a strong correlation (Matsuda et al. 2010 ). The expression of rol genes (rolA, rolB, and rolC) is responsible for enhanced levels of secondary metabolites in hairy roots (Shkryl et al. 2008) .

Enhancement in triterpenoid yield was also reported after drought stress (Selmar and Kleinw\u00e4chter 2013) . Drought started the formation of reactive oxidation species such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), hydroxyl radical (HO \u2212 ), superoxide (O 2\u2212\u2212 ) and singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) to cause a disturbance in normal cell homeostasis (Ozkur et al. 2009 ). To overcome these situations, plants depend on enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems. Triterpenoids are associated with antioxidant activities (Okubo and Yoshiki 2000) . Glycyrrhizin (triterpenoid) acting as a ROS depreciator, plays a crucial role in contesting the oxidative stress thus minimizes the negative effect of drought stress (Kim and Lee 2008) . Isopentenyl pyrophosphate, a precursor of terpene biosynthesis, was enhanced under drought stress (Turtola et al. 2003) . Glycyrrhizin production was also enhanced through methyl jasmonate treatment in G. inflata (Wongwicha et al. 2011) . MeJa and SA enhanced the yield of glycyrrhizin by 3.8 and 4.1-fold, respectively, in the roots of G. glabra (Shabani et al. 2009 ). In the present work, cellulase (cellulolytic enzyme) and mannan were used as biotic elicitors that proved to be efficient inducers of enhanced glycyrrhizin content. In previous reports, mannan enhanced pseudohypericin production up to 2.8-fold and hypericin production up to 1.7-fold in seedlings of Hypericum adenotrichum (Yamaner et al. 2013 ). Cellulase was also effective in enhancing the yield of capsidiol in suspension cultures of Capsicum annuum (Ma 2008) . The exact mechanism of action of elicitation by cellulase and mannan is still not clearly known, but it may be presumed that they activate the genes of secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways. The possible mode of action of the cellulase mechanism is that it either depolarizes the plant cell or activates the endogenous ion channels. Probably, due to the pore forming ability of cellulase, the ions are filtered with ease by the membrane avoiding any need for channel activation and receptor binding (Klusener and Weiler 1999) .",

Data are mean \u00b1 SE of three biological replicates glycyrrhizin from hairy root cultures of G. glabra in a bioreactor system. This could be empirically utilized in the commercialized mass production of glycyrrhizin. Concentration and duration of elicitation are plant and elicitor specific, therefore, optimized conditions could be helpful in future molecular studies regarding pathway analysis of glycyrrhizin biosynthesis. Moreover, glycyrrhizin is a valuable pharmaceutical compound and due to its root centric nature, extraction of this compound severely destroys the whole plant thereby endangering its existence and affecting biodiversity. By applying the above-mentioned approaches, high concentrations of glycyrrhizin could be obtained without loss of biodiversity and in a short time span.",
