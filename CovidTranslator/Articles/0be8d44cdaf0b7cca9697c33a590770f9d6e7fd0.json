            "text": "Erlang differential equation models of epidemic processes provide more realistic disease-class transition dynamics from susceptible (S) to exposed (E) to infectious (I) and removed (R) categories than the ubiquitous SEIR model. The latter is itself is at one end of the spectrum of Erlang SE m I n R models with m \u2265 1 concatenated E compartments and n \u2265 1 concatenated I compartments. Discrete-time models, however, are computationally much simpler to simulate and fit to epidemic outbreak data than continuous-time differential equations, and are also much more readily extended to include demographic and other types of stochasticity. Here we formulate discrete-time deterministic analogs of the Erlang models, and their stochastic extension, based on a time-to-go distributional principle. Depending on which distributions are used (e.g. discretized Erlang, Gamma, Beta, or Uniform distributions), we demonstrate that our formulation represents both a discretization of Erlang epidemic models and generalizations thereof. We consider the challenges of fitting SE m I n R models and our discrete-time analog to data (the recent outbreak of Ebola in Liberia). We demonstrate that the latter performs much better than the former; although confining fits to strict SEIR formulations reduces the numerical challenges, but sacrifices best-fit likelihood scores by at least 7%.",

            "text": "An SEIR epidemic modelling framework, where S, E, I and R represent the named susceptible (S), exposed (E: infected but not yet infectious), infectious (I), and removed (R: either dead or recovered and now immune) disease classes -and italicized letters S, E, I, and R represent the number of individuals in each of these classes -underpins all infectious disease modelling at the population level [27, 52] . This holds whether the models are continuous or discrete-time [21] , deterministic or stochastic [2, 10] , or framed at the compartmental-or individual-level formulation [1, 11, 24] . Fitting epidemiological models to real data possess significant challenges because most epidemics do not conform to the assumptions underlying the basic SEIR formulation. In particular, populations are rarely spatially homogeneous [25, 30, 32] , and disease transmission varies with age [55] and other individual-level factors, including behaviour [16] . An additional acknowledged weaknesses of the SEIR formulation is that if a group of n individuals enter class X (X = E or I) at time t and exit at rate \u03b3 , then the number of individuals still in state X at time t + \u03c4 is given by the exponential function n(t + \u03c4 ) = n(t) e \u2212\u03b3 X \u03c4 [56] . This approach has been shown from outbreak data to underestimate the basic reproductive ratio R 0 of an epidemic process [56] . A more reasonable assumption is that individuals will mostly exit around a characteristic diseaseclass-specific residence time \u03c1 X , which corresponds to the latent period and infectious period for any disease [49, 56] . Models that address deviations from the above assumptions have been proposed. For example, one way to modify the standard SEIR continuous-time formulation so that the modal exit-time of individuals from disease states E and I is close to empirically measured values, \u03c1 E and \u03c1 I respectively, is to use either a discrete-time formulation in which individuals take a set number of time periods to move through each disease state (e.g. as has been done in modelling SARS [23, 37] ), or to use a continuous time distributed-delay approach [7, 9, 13, 33] . This latter approach can be modelled using a so-called boxcar formulation: the process by which individuals pass through each disease state (i.e. compartment) X is represented by individuals passing through k X concatenated sub-compartments at a rate \u03b3 X in each of the sub-compartments [7, 31, 33, 35] (Figure 1 ). In this case, the number of individuals n(t) entering at time t still in state X at time t + \u03c4 is not given by an exponential function, but rather n(t) multiplied by (1 \u2212 F Erlang (\u03c4 , k X , \u03b3 X )), where F Erlang (\u03c4 , k X , \u03b3 X ) is the cumulative Erlang distribution with parameters k X and \u03b3 X . Note that the Erlang is a special case of the Gamma distribution when the shape parameter k X is a positive integer [33] . Further, the fact that a distributed-delay integrodifferential equation formulation can, under certain assumptions, be turned into an ordinary differential equation formulation of higher dimension, using the so-called 'linear chain trick' has been known in biological modelling for the past 40 years ( [14, 40, 44] , and see [51] for a more recent treatment).",

            "text": "Beyond individuals emerging from a disease state according to an Erlang distribution, a more general discrete-time modelling approach can be taken in which any distribution of emergence can be specified. Here we develop a general discrete-time, distributed-delay formulation, taking the novel approach of identifying disease subclasses that represent the number of days individuals have left before they transfer from the current disease class to the next in the chain (i.e. E to I and I to R, and so on), as depicted in Figure 1 . This permits exponential, Erlang, and Uniform distributions, among others, to be used. Beyond comparing our discrete-time formulation that corresponds to continuous-time Erlang formulations, we compare simulation output among the Erlang, Exponential, and Uniform cases, demonstrating some surprising results. For example, the case that yields the highest levels of prevalence switches as the values of the reproductive ratios R 0 increase from low (R 0 = 1.25) to very high (R 0 = 20). We also demonstrate how easily discrete-time formulations can be implemented stochastically, and we compare sample mean ensembles of stochastic simulations to discrete-time solutions. Finally, we compare the efficiencies of fitting continuous-time Erlang models and our various discrete models to real data. To keep our analysis focused, our formulation and simulations ignore the processes of recruitment and mortality. These, of course, are easily added, as we discuss, along with other important extensions such as spatial structure using metapopulation networks. The standard continuous-time SEIR compartmental model has individuals flowing through the E and I compartments at rates \u03b3 E and \u03b3 I respectively, with rates of flow from compartments S to E and V to S (V is the immune part of R, D is the dead part of R) represented by \u03c4 and \u03b3 V respectively. The boxcar or Erlang version divides E into k E and I into k I sub-compartments with the mean time that it takes to pass through compartments E and I now given by \u03c1 E = k E /\u03b3 E and \u03c1 I = k I /\u03b3 I , respectively. The discrete time-to-go model can be regarded as the discrete-time analog of the Erlang model where the proportions (deterministic setting) or probabilities (stochastic setting) p E i , i = 1, . . . , n E and p I j , j = 1, . . . , n I follow Erlang distributions, as described in the text.",

A remedy for this is to assume that \u03b2 has the exponential form \u03b2(t) = \u03b2 0 e \u2212\u03b5t (e.g. as in [3] ). This approach, however, implies that \u03b2 declines most steeply at the start of the epidemic -a highly suspect assumption.

In the absence of an independent estimate for t c when fitting models to data, one can estimate \u03b2 0 by fitting a constant \u03b2 model to the early stages of an epidemic, and then use this value to estimate the reproductive ratio parameter R 0 (the number of individuals that the index case can be expected to infect at the start of the epidemic [15, 26] ). Using the simple frequency-dependent transmission rate (Equation (4)) and assuming that \u03b2 is constant over time, the model given by Equations (1)-(4) is a five parameter system (\u03b2 > 0, \u03b3 E > 0, and \u03b3 I > 0, as well as positive integers k E and k I ) that can be fitted to data to obtain the best estimate of the transmission rate parameter \u03b2, and the mean residence times",

The primary consideration is to have a good way to match up initial values because the continuous model has k E + k I + 2 states while the discrete model has n E + n I + 2 states (where, typically, n X > 2k X , X = E, I). Further, when injecting stochastic models into the comparative study, one needs to be cognizant of the fact that continuous and discrete deterministic simulations are independent of scale -i.e. the size of N -and only the stochastic simulations are affected by the size of N. Specifically, the influence of demographic stochasticity on simulated values reduces at a rate proportional to 1/ \u221a N. In our first set of simulations, we selected S(0) = 10, 000, but varied S(0) from 1000 to 10 6 in subsequent sets of simulations that explore aspects of demographic stochasticity and compare the efficiency of fitting discrete versus continuous models to simulated data. To initiate the start of an epidemic, we placed one individual in the last Esubcomponent class, which corresponds to setting E k E (0) = 1 in the continuous time model and E 0 (0) = 1 in the discrete-time deterministic and stochastic Erlang models. In all of the simulations, the initial values of the remaining E and I subcomponent states were set to 0, as was R(0).",

The main difference among the four groups corresponding to a particular set of values (\u03c1 E ,\u03c1 I ,\u03c1 E+I ) is the amount of variation associated with the distributions around \u03c1 E and \u03c1 I : specifically, 5-boxcar formulations with associated progression rate\u03b3 have larger variation around \u03c1 X than 10-boxcar formulations with associated rate 2\u03b3 . These four groups of four cases each were implemented in the context of two values of \u03b2 to yield corresponding values of the reproductive ratio R 0 . The resulting eight sets of four cases fall very neatly into eight sets of outputs (Figure 2(a) ), indicating that the selection of 5 versus 10-boxcar formulations makes very little difference in terms of the projected levels of disease prevalence associated with a given (\u03b2,\u03c1 E ,\u03c1 I ,\u03c1 E+I ) combination.

This is particularly true of local school populations where the same group of several hundred children aggregate for a substantial portion of the day, on five of the seven days each week.

It remains unclear precisely which circumstances enable the convergence between the mean of an ensemble of stochastic instantiations and the solution of its discrete counterpart. This convergence depends, at least, upon the following three aspects: Figure 5 . To see Figure 6 . The left, middle, and right columns are plots of prevalence obtained from the discrete deterministic model (blue curves) and averages over ensembles of 100 runs (n = 100) of the discrete stochastic Erlang models (red curves; broken lines are \u00b1 one standard deviation around solid curve mean) for Cases 1, 17, and 33 (cf. Table 1 ). the effects of N and R 0 on the mean of ensembles of instantiations of the stochastic model, consider the (\u03b3 E , k E , \u03b3 I , k I ) = (5, 5, 1, 1) configuration of the model for the cases \u03b2 = 0.25 (R 0 = 1.25), \u03b2 = 1 (R 0 = 5), and \u03b2 = 2 (R 0 = 20), which correspond to, Runs 1, 17, and 33 in Table 1 , for scenarios N = 10 3 , 10 4 ,and 10 6 . The results obtained are presented in Figure 6 . From these results, we see that ensembles larger than n = 100 are needed to smooth out the curves generated when R 0 and N are both relatively small (e.g. R 0 = 1.25 and N = 10 3 ; top left panel), but are quite smooth when either N is relatively large (e.g. R 0 = 1.25 and N = 10 6 ; bottom left panel), or when R 0 is somewhat larger (e.g. R 0 = 5 and N = 10 3 ; top middle panel). When R 0 = 1.25, the ensemble mean underestimates the deterministic solution (left column of panels) by 25-30%. This falls to just under 10% when R 0 = 5 (centre column of panels), and below 2% when R 0 = 20 (right column of panels).",

The models tested on the Ebola data (the discrete and continuous Erlang) were compared to the discrete and continuous versions of the standard SEIR formulation (with an exponential distribution governing transitions between compartments) to judge the utility of the alternative methods for model fitting. Because the transmission rate was treated as a constant throughout the epidemic, only the initial quasi-exponential increase was used for the purposes of fitting. In order to fit these models to the subsequent decline in infections (when the population of susceptible hosts is not exhausted during the initial increase), assumptions regarding the form of the change in the transmission parameter (\u03b2) must be made. While some have used an exponential decay to represent this shifting \u03b2 value over time [3] , others have used threshold functions [34] or related the transmission parameter to environmental covariates like seasonality [43] . Fitting to the initial increase in the epidemic should be informative with regard to the ability of each alternative formulation to fit to real epidemic data without requiring a potentially confounding assumption about the form of the change in the transmission rate over time. As in [3] , a total population size of 10 6 was used for each model, and the epidemic was initialized with a single infected case.",

Even when averages over a substantial number of instantiations are used to calculate the fit associated with a particular parameter set, the uncertainty bounds surrounding this mean may be just as important in producing the empirical data as the mean itself. A real-world epidemic is indeed a stochastic process, but it is unclear whether the epidemic represents an instantiation at one of the extremes around the set of parameters that govern the process or the mean or a realization somewhere in between. This fact hinders model fitting procedures in epidemiology when using a deterministic model as well.

Data, however, are usually aggregated and binned into discrete-time intervals, not only for convenience, but also because the precise times of actual events (e.g. when exactly a particular individual was exposed to a dose of pathogen, or when exactly a particular individual became or ceased to be infectious) is not usually known. Thus, continuous models cannot be regarded as intrinsically more accurate than discrete models, particularly when noise within the data is taken into account. All else being equal, we should choose models that are computationally more tractable. This is particularly the case for discrete-time models where the interval is synchronized with the temporal aggregation of data, typically daily or weekly for fast epidemics, or monthly or quarterly for slow epidemics. Further, when extending formulations to incorporate stochasticity, discrete models are more easily implemented than having to apply a Gillespie or modified Gillespie algorithm to simulate continuous time stochastic processes, which may also require an unrealistic Poisson process assumption [17, 18, 54] . No matter how little or much stochasticity is associated with environmental factors, demographic stochasticity always plays a major role in epidemics because all epidemics start with a small number of infected individuals. This implies that even for values of R 0 comfortably larger than 1 (e.g. in the range 2-4), the fadeout of an epidemic before it can breakout is an event we can expect to occasionally observe [2, 10, 24, 45, 47, 48] .",

In both cases, we should avoid focusing our computational efforts on model fitting at the expense of numerical simulations to obtain broad comprehension: the imperative to find the best fitting set of parameters for the model at hand comes at the expense of obtaining a deeper understanding through exploratory simulations. This exploration includes a full assessment of possible ranges of outcomes due to stochastic factors (both demographic and environmental). Additional exploration requires that we incorporate factors that profoundly affect the course of epidemics, yet are not included in our SEIR formulations. Specifically, here we addressed the issue of replacing exponential residence times in disease classes with the more realistic distributed-delay residences times. We also overcome the issue of modelling declining transmission rates over time by fitting our models only to data from early stages of the epidemic.",

Equally important for many diseases is eliminating the assumption that the epidemic is occurring in a spatially homogeneous population. In these cases, models need to include spatial structure. This is most easily done by assuming a metapopulation structure: i.e. a small network of relatively large homogeneous subpopulations [6, 30, 36] . In the context of epidemics, spatial structure typically has two major components. The first is the way populations are distributed into major population centres, each of which can be assumed to constitute a homogeneous subpopulation. The second is to appropriately characterize the movement of individuals among subpopulations [32] , particularly individuals who are infected, but still asymptomatic (e.g. individuals who are in class E, but make the transition to class I once they have moved).",
