There is no highly effective medicine or vaccine, most of the patients were recovered by their own immune response, especially the virus specific IgG and IgM responses. However, the IgG/ IgM responses is barely known. To enable the global understanding of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG/ IgM responses, a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray with 18 out of the 28 predicted proteins was constructed. The microarray was applied to profile the IgG/ IgM responses with 29 convalescent sera. The results suggest that at the convalescent phase 100% of patients had IgG/ IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2, especially to protein N, S1 but not S2. S1 purified from mammalian cell demonstrated the highest performance to differentiate COVID-19 patients from controls. Besides protein N and S1, significant antibody responses to ORF9b and NSP5 were also identified. Indepth analysis showed that the level of S1 IgG positively correlate to age and the level of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), especially for women, while the level of S1 IgG negatively correlate to Ly% (Lymphocyte percentage). This study presents the first whole picture of the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG/ IgM responses, and provides insights to develop precise immuno-diagnostics, effective treatment and vaccine.",

In China alone, by Mar. 18, 2020, there are 81,163 diagnosed cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 3,242 death according to Chinese CDC (http://2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-nCoV/). Globally, 184,976 diagnosed cases were reported in 4 were observed by treating the patients with convalescent plasma collected from COVID-19 patients 16,17 . However, because SARS-CoV-2 is a newly occurred pathogen, the IgG/IgM response is barely known. There are many important questions need to be experimentally addressed: 1. What's the variation among different patients, especially for antibodies against nucleocapsid protein (protein N) and spike protein (protein S)? 2. Besides nucleocapsid protein and spike protein, is there any other viral protein that could trigger significant antibody response for at least some of the patients? 3. Is it possible to link the intensity of the overall IgG/IgM response to the severity of patients? and etc. It is urgently needed to answer these questions, especially in a systematic manner. Once these questions are answered or at least touched, we may can understand the IgG/IgM response in detail, and in turn facilitate us to develop more effective treatment, therapeutic antibody and protective vaccine.",

However, these techniques usually can only test one target protein or one antibody in one reaction. Thus a powerful tool is needed that enables the studying of the IgG/ IgM responses on a systems level. Featured by the capability of high-throughput and parallel analysis, and miniaturized size, protein microarray may be the choice for systematic study of the SARS-CoV-2 stimulated IgG/IgM responses. A variety of protein microarrays have already been constructed and successfully applied for serum antibody profiling, such as the Mtb proteome microarray 23 , the SARS-CoV protein microarray 11 , and the Dengue virus protein microarray 24 .",

The protein sequences were subjected for codon optimization and then cloned into E.coli expression vector (pET32a or pGEX-4T-1). The final expression library includes 31 clones (Table S1 ). After several rounds of optimizations, so far, we managed to purify 17 of these proteins (Fig. S1) .

Since the Fc tag could be recognized by fluorescence labeled anti-human IgG antibody, the ACE2-Fc generated high signals for all the tests, which could serve as control for the anti-human IgG antibody, though the initial reason to include ACE2 on the microarray is for applications other than serum profiling. To test the experimental reproducibility of the serum profiling using the microarray, two COVID-19 convalescent sera were random selected. Three independent analysis for each of these two sera were repeated on the microarray. Pearson correlation coefficients between two repeats were 0.988 and 0.981 for IgG and IgM, respectively, and the overall fluorescence intensity ranges of the repeated experiments were fairly close, demonstrating high reproducibility of the microarray based serum profiling both for IgG and IgM (Fig. 2 C-E) .",

Serum from each patient was collected on the day of hospital discharge when the standard criteria were met. And there is no recurrence reported for these patients. All the samples and the controls were probed on the proteome microarray, after data filtering and normalization, we built the IgG and IgM profile for each serum and performed clustering analysis to generate heatmaps for overall visualization ( Fig. 3 and Fig. 4) . The patients and controls are perfectly clustered for both IgG and IgM, justifying the utility of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray for the virus specific antibody analysis of COVID-19. As expected, the N protein and S1 protein elicited high antibody responses in almost all patients but barely in control groups, confirming the efficacy of these two proteins for diagnosis.

For the present cohort, both S and N proteins, except for S1-4, were proved to have excellent discrimination ability between COVID-19 patients and controls both for IgG and IgM (Fig. 5A, B, Fig. S3A, B) . The overall IgG signal intensities were much higher than that of IgM, mainly because the sera were collected at the convalescent stage when IgG are supposed to be dominant. It is notable that two sera from control group have significantly higher IgG antibody response to N proteins than other controls, with one to N-Nter and another to C-Nter (Fig. 5G) , suggesting the N protein may generate a higher false positive rate than S protein, especially S1. To investigate the consistence of signal intensities among different sources or versions (C-term, N-term, domain or fragment) of proteins, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients among S proteins (Fig. 5C ) and N proteins (Fig. S2F) using data of the convalescent sera.

            "text": "It is known that immune response is closely related to the disease courses. To evaluate how the relationship between the antibody response and the situation of the disease, we investigated the correlations between IgG or IgM responses to proteins of virus with clinical characteristics. Not surprisingly, the days after onset were correlated with the IgG response against S1 (Fig. 7A ) or N protein (date not shown), as the IgG response usually increases over time and reach the peak several weeks after onset, which is observed by other studies 25 and SARS patients 26 . In contrast, there is no correlations between IgM response with days after onset. It was observed that age is also correlated with IgG response to S1 or N proteins (Fig. 7B, Fig. S4A ). Three patients with mild symptoms indicated by red arrows show low IgG response and it is highly variable in the patients with common symptoms. It is notable that in male patients, especially older than 40, the correlation between age and S1 IgG is very poor (Fig. 7B) . To further investigate this phenomenon, we separately analyzed the male and female patients in different age groups. For female older than 40 years old, the S1 IgG response is significantly stronger than that either in the group of female younger than 40 or the male counterpart (Fig. 7C) . For male younger than 40, high correlation between age and S1 or N IgG response was observed (Fig. 7D, Fig. S4C ), and this correlation is not caused by days after onset (Fig. S4B) . For female, whatever the age range is, IgG response to S1 or N is highly correlated with age ( Fig. S4D, E) . To exclude the influence of days after onset, the patients with similar (18-24) days after onset were selected ( Fig. S4F) . High correlation is still observed (Fig. 7E, Fig. S4G ), demonstrating the correlation is independent of days after onset.",

It turns out the correlation was still high and significant both for S1 and N protein specific IgG response (Fig. 7G, Fig. S4J ), demonstrating the correlation is independent of age and days after onset. Since the LDH level could serve as an indicator of disease severity 26,27 , it seems that immune system of women may be more sensitive to the virus. It was also found that the IgG response to S1 or N protein negatively correlates with the percentage of lymphocyte (Ly%) (Fig. 7H, I, Fig. S4K ), however, this correlation might be dependent of age ( Fig. S4L ).",

As many studies reported, LDH tends to have a higher level in severe COVID-19 patients and could be an indicator of severity 26, 27 . In fact, it has been observed in SARS patients that more severe SARS is associated with more robust serological response 26,40 , similar association was confirmed in COVID-19 patients, especially for females. Interestingly, we observed high correlation between age with IgG response in female patients and in male patients with age less than 40 but not in older male patients, implying the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 may differ in gender. It is reported that severe cases are significantly more frequent in aged patients and the mortality of male patients is higher than that of female, but the reason is not clear. Based on our observations, we assumed that the situation might be associated with the immune response. However, female patients, compared with male patients, may generate humoral response more efficiently. This difference should be considered during treatment.",

Secondly, most of the proteins on the microarray are not expressed in mammalian cells, critical post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation is absent. It is known that there are 23 N-glycosylation sites on S protein, which is heavily glycosylated, and the glycosylation may play critical roles in antibody-antigen recognition 5, 41 . We are preparing these proteins using mammalian cell systems. Once the microarray is upgraded with proteins purified from mammalian cells, PTM specific IgG/IgM response may could be elicited.
