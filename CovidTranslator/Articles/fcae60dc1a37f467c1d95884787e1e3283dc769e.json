In an ideal world, the aircraft cabin would be pressurized to simulate sea level conditions. To achieve this would require an extremely strong and heavy aircraft structure with severe implications on load-carrying capacity, fuel consumption, and range. As a result, a compromise is struck, with airworthiness regulations stating that \"pressurized cabins and compartments to be occupied must be equipped to provide a cabin pressure altitude of not more than 8,000 ft at the maximum operating altitude of the airplane under normal operating conditions.\" 2 Most aircraft maintain a cabin altitude of around 6000-7000 feet during normal operation. Newer aircraft, such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350, are manufactured from composite material enabling them to operate at lower cabin altitudes of around 5000-6000 feet.",

            "text": "Due to the change in cabin pressure during climb and descent, individuals may experience discomfort from the expansion of gas trapped within the body. Gas trapped within the gut or the middle ear and sinuses is normally able to escape without any problem, but there may be occasions when this is not so. The human ear is particularly sensitive to rates of pressure change. The middle ear cavity, separated from the outer ear by the tympanic membrane, communicates with the nasopharynx and hence the ambient atmosphere by way of the eustachian tube, the proximal two-thirds of which has soft walls that are normally collapsed. During ascent to altitude, the gas in the middle ear cavity expands and escapes through the eustachian tube into the nasopharynx, thereby equalizing the pressure across the tympanic membrane. The pharyngeal portion of the eustachian tube acts as a one-way valve, allowing expanding air to escape easily to the atmosphere, which may be felt as a \"popping\" sensation as air escapes from the tube during ascent. During descent, the opposite occurs. The air in the middle ear contracts and air from the nasopharynx must enter the middle ear to maintain equal pressure across the tympanic membrane. This can cause difficulties for some individuals, as now the eustachian tube can collapse due to the negative pressure developing in the middle ear, which prevents passive flow of air back into the middle ear cavity. This relative increase of pressure on the outside of the tympanic membrane pushes it into the middle ear cavity, and may result in a sensation of fullness, a decrease in hearing acuity, and pain. Active maneuvers such as swallowing, yawning, and jaw movements can open the eustachian tube, and relieve the pressure. If this is not effective, it may be necessary to occlude the nostrils and raise the pressure in the mouth and nose to force air into the middle ear cavities. This can usually be achieved simply by raising the floor of the mouth with the glottis shut, or by raising the pressure in the entire respiratory tract by contracting the expiratory muscles (Valsalva maneuver). Because descent causes more problems with eustachian tube dysfunction than ascent, infants often begin crying during the descent portion of the flight which can passively assist pressure equalization.",

There is no evidence that exposure to a low-humidity environment itself leads to dehydration, although local humidity can cause mild subjective symptoms such as dryness of the eyes and mucous membranes. 7 No significant effect has been shown on measures of psychomotor performance, although there can be some changes in the fluid regulatory hormones. 7 It is unlikely that low humidity has any ill effects, provided overall hydration is maintained by drinking adequate fluid. The body's homeostatic mechanisms ensure that central hydration is maintained, although the peripheral physical effects can lead to discomfort. Dry skin can be alleviated by using aqueous moisturizing creams, particularly just before flight, and dry eye irritation can be alleviated by using moisturizing eye drops. Individuals prone to develop dry eyes are advised not to wear contact lenses during long flights in pressurized aircraft. 8 Although the aircraft cabin environment is similar to many other indoor home and office environments where people are exposed to a mixture of external and recirculated air, the cabin environment is also different in many respects: the high occupant density, the inability of the occupants to leave at will, and the need for pressurization. In flight, there is a combination of environmental factors, including low air pressure and low humidity, low-frequency vibration, and constant background noise. Although the noise and vibration can contribute to fatigue, the levels are all below those accepted as potentially harmful to hearing. 8, 9 Ozone Ozone is a highly reactive form of oxygen found naturally in the upper atmosphere. It is formed primarily above the tropopause from the action of ultraviolet (UV) light on oxygen molecules, varying with latitude, altitude, season, and weather conditions. The highest concentrations in the northern hemisphere are generally found at high altitude over high-latitude locations during the winter and spring.",

A novel strain of influenza A H1N1, so-called \"swine flu,\" emerged from a pig farm in central Mexico in 2009 and eventually caused over 200,000 deaths worldwide within the first year the virus circulated. 22 Although air travel was strongly associated with the importation of cases to other countries, actual transmission during air travel, though often suspected, was difficult to document. [23] [24] [25] An investigation by the CDC among passengers who flew on four North American flights in April 2009 with individuals who were ill with laboratory-confirmed H1N1 showed low risk of in-flight transmission to passengers and crew. In-flight transmission of the new virus is unlikely in flights of relatively short duration, although longer intercontinental flights may pose a greater risk of transmission. Offering symptomatic passengers medical care upon arrival at airport checkpoints may be an effective way to screen for influenza, and is likely to be more cost effective than exit and entry screening, quarantine, and travel restrictions. 26 The simplest, most effective, and least costly control measures involve the individual behaviors of travelers and of their health care providers. 27",

            "text": "An in-flight medical emergency is defined as a medical occurrence requiring the assistance of the cabin crew. It may involve the use of medical equipment or drugs, and involve a request for assistance from a medical professional traveling as a passenger. It can be as simple as a headache or a vasovagal episode, or something major such as a myocardial infarction or impending childbirth. In some respects, dealing with an in-flight medical emergency is akin to a \"wilderness medicine\" situation, as the responding provider is in an unfamiliar and austere environment, with limited resources, often requiring improvisation and a common-sense approach. 40 However, since health care professionals are not guaranteed to be on board every flight, or may not be willing or able to render aide, most airlines have ground-based medical consultation services available to provide recommendations for care during flight. Associated liabilities for volunteer medical care are generally determined by the law of the country in which the incident occurs. In the United States, legal protection is provided by the Aviation Medical Assistance Act (1998), but such volunteers are not protected if they engage in gross negligence or intentionally cause harm. 41 The incidence is comparatively low, although the media impact of an event can be significant. One major international airline reported 3022 incidents occurring in something over 34 million passengers carried in 1 year, the figures remaining consistent despite changes in the demography of travelers. Most in-flight medical emergencies are related to syncope, respiratory symptoms, or gastrointestinal symptoms; few of these result in diversion of the aircraft or in death. 42 Any acute medical condition occurring during a flight can be alarming owing to the remoteness of the environment. The cabin crew receive training in advanced first aid and basic life support and the use of the aircraft emergency medical equipment. Many airlines give training in excess of the regulatory requirements, particularly when an extended range of medical equipment is carried. In serious cases the crew may request assistance from a medical professional traveling as a passenger, referred to as a Good Samaritan.",
