This procedure is laborious and poses LN 2 related hazards. An alternative logistics for transportation of samples was investigated. Use of Flinders Technology Associates (FTA \u00ae ) elute card was evaluated for transportation of extended bovine semen to screen BoHV-1 DNA by real-time PCR targeting gB gene and the method was compared with the OIE approved Chelex resin based method. A protocol for extraction of BoHV-1 DNA from FTA \u00ae card spotted with extended semen was optimized. The viral DNA was found to be stable on FTA \u00ae card for at least 28 days when the cards are stored at 4\u00b0-37\u00b0C. The analytical sensitivity for the assay was determined using variable dilutions of BoHV-1 spiked semen and positive plasmid harbouring gB gene (97bp) spotted onto FTA \u00ae card and it was found to be 10 0.8 TCID 50 /ml or 100 copies respectively in real-time PCR. The test could detect as low as 10 0.008 TCID 50 /ml or 1 copy of positive plasmid when more number of replicates (n = 6) of the same sample were tested. This sensitivity was found to be comparable to Chelex method and both the methods demonstrated a very strong correlation (r = 0.9774; 95% CI: 0.9620-0.9860) in terms of Ct value (p < 0.0001). The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the FTA method in comparison to the Chelex method was 83.08% (95% CI: 71.73%-91.24%) and 93.23% (95% CI: 89.38%-96.01%) respectively when 316 samples were screened by both the methods. The degree of agreement between these two tests was good (Kappa value: 0.738; 95% CI: 0.646-0.829). The method was found to be robust and highly repeatable in inter-assay and intra-assay precision testing. The result suggests that the FTA \u00ae card holds promise as an alternative system for transportation of EFS for downstream screening of BoHV-1 DNA.",

Following primary infection, the virus becomes latent in the sensory neurons of trigeminal/sacral ganglia. During stress or immune suppression, reactivation of the virus occurs and the virion is shed in various body secretions viz. nasal, lachrymal, seminal and genital secretions (Jones et al., 2006; Kutish et al., 1990) . The BoHV-1 virus is intermittently excreted in the semen of IBR sero-positive bulls and thus the virus can be transmitted from infected animal to susceptible animal thorough such contaminated semen during natural or artificial insemination (AI) (Mars et al., 2000) . Although culling of sero-positive bulls are recommended, it is difficult to follow in many settings. Hence, in such cases it is advocated that each ejaculate of the bull be tested for the absence of BoHV-1 either by real-time PCR or by cell culture. (DADF, 2014; OIE, 2017a) .",

FTA \u00ae (Flinders Technology Associates) cards are specially treated filter papers that inactivate the pathogenic bacteria/virus upon contact, thereby allowing safe and easy transport of materials to the laboratory (Muthukrishnan et al., 2008) . A number of studies have evaluated use of FTA \u00ae cards for screening of infectious diseases of veterinary importance namely, rabies virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, newcastle virus, swine influenza virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), avian metapneumovirus, bovine respiratory disease complex (BVDV, BRSV, coronavirus, BoHV-1) (Inoue et al., 2007; Maldonado et al., 2009; Muthukrishnan et al., 2008; Perozo et al., 2006 , Picard-Meyer et al., 2007 Prickett et al., 2008; Wacharapluesadee et al., 2003) . Most of these studies have shown comparable sensitivity and specificity of detection with samples transported through traditional cold chain. The findings of these studies suggest, FTA \u00ae card can be used as an alternative system of sample transport and storage for nucleic acid based diagnosis. OIE also suggests that FTA \u00ae cards can be used as an alternative system for transport of specimens for detection of rabies virus using molecular techniques (OIE, 2013) . However, detection of pathogen from samples spotted onto FTA cards is dependent on several factors viz. nucleic acid concentration in the sample, the inherent stability of nucleic acid and the extraction procedure adopted.",

A number of experiments were performed with the BoHV-1 virus diluted in MEM to optimize the general procedures for spotting and retrieval of DNA from the FTA \u00ae card viz. quantity of samples to be spotted, the size of the disc to be punched out, the number of discs to be used for extraction, elution volume, temperature and time. The above parameters were decided with reference to the Ct value obtained in the real-time PCR assay for the corresponding samples extracted using Chelex-resin based method. The manufacturer's protocol for DNA extraction did not result in any amplification in the real-time PCR assay for the BoHV-1 spiked extended semen spotted FTA \u00ae cards. Therefore, additional processing steps in the DNA extraction procedure were attempted to ensure optimum extraction of viral DNA. Four different types of modifications were attempted viz. (i) treatment of the extended semen sample with trypsin prior to spotting, (ii) treatment of punched out disc with lysis buffer (proteinase K and DTT), (iii) pre-treatment of the FTA \u00ae card either with PK + DTT, PK alone or DTT alone before spotting of extended semen; and (iv) treatment with either PK + DTT, PK alone or DTT alone of dried semen spotted FTA \u00ae card. The real-time PCR result suggests all above modifications were successful in ensuring extraction of viral DNA (data not shown). However, the following observations were made. The treatment of extended semen with trypsin resulted in higher Ct value relative to the corresponding sample where DNA was extracted using Chelex resin. The incorporation of lysis solution (PK + DTT) for FTA \u00ae card treatment compromised the integrity of the paper leaving fine paper fibres into the elution. The pre-treatment of cards either with PK + DTT or only DTT before spotting of samples resulted in positive amplification. However, pre-treatment of cards before sample spotting may not be practicable in field settings. The treatment of PK + DTT and DTT alone on the dried semen spot, followed by overnight incubation before proceeding for DNA extraction using manufacturer's instruction had the desired results. The real-time PCR results of these samples matched that of the results from the corresponding Chelex based DNA extracted samples. Since the treatment with PK + DTT and DTT alone did not have any appreciable difference in the results, the final protocol involved the addition of only DTT (data not shown).",

The result also revealed that, by 15 min the DNAs are eluted and keeping up to 45 min for elution do not have any adverse effect. The treatment of the semen spotted cards with DTT was found necessary as samples processed without DTT addition did not result in DNA amplification. Further, no difference in Ct value was observed for semen spotted onto FTA \u00ae cards treated with different volumes of 0.1 M DTT.

DTT is a reducing agent that cleaves disulphide bonds and allows proteins to unfold. In semen, it dissociates protamines from DNA and also helps to remove the sliminess of the semen by breaking the proteins. The other advantages of DTT are its effectiveness, low toxicity, mild odour and its ability to work efficiently compared to \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (Griffin, 2013) . Inhibitors, if present, in the samples have a significant impact on the sensitivity of detection in PCR based tests. The DNA eluted from FTA \u00ae cards spotted with BoHV-1 spiked semen batches as well as known naturally infected extended semen batches could be successfully amplified in real-time PCR and the Ct values matched with the result of Chelex resin based DNA extraction method. This indirectly suggest that PCR inhibitory substances bound to the FTA \u00ae card were not released during elution. These experiments, however, do not ascertain either the presence or effect of PCR inhibitors on the sensitivity of the assay. Therefore, as an important quality control step, inclusion of necessary reagents (primers and probe) for the simultaneous detection of housekeeping gene and the target DNA could be considered in further development of the assay (duplex real-time PCR). Wang et al (2007) has evaluated the performance of duplex real-time PCR targeting the gB gene of BoHV-1 and bovine growth hormone (bGH) as internal control and have shown equivalent performance with the individual PCR assays. Alternatively, in place of housekeeping gene, an internal control template (a cryptic DNA) can be spiked to the extended semen spotted FTA \u00ae card during the DTT solution addition step of DNA extraction and the same can be amplified during the real-time PCR.",

To prevent carry over contamination, different procedures for decontamination of the punching device were evaluated.

This procedure was able to prevent carry-over contamination even at handling 10 4.8 TCID 50 /ml BoHV-1 virus spiked in extended bovine semen. This concentration of the virus is not normally expected in clinical samples. Therefore, it can be presumed that serial punching of blank filter paper between samples is adequate for the desired purpose. Further, the filter paper disc from the fifth punch was subjected for DNA extraction, as carry-over contamination control, for every seven sample processed during clinical sample screening. The elution from this disc showed no amplification in the real-time PCR assays.",

Both Chelex and FTA method detected 54 samples. The difference in detection between the two methods was noticed when the virus concentration in the clinical sample is low (reflected by higher Ct values of 38-40).
