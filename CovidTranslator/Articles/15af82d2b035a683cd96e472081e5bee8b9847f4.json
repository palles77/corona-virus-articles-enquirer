            "text": "According to the data of the World Health Organi zation (WHO), the share of mortality caused by infec tious and parasitic diseases considerably decreased (approximately, by 15-20%; Fig. 1 ) versus the moral ity of cardiovascular and cancer diseases, which noticeably increased. Undoubtedly, the expansion of vaccination in developing and developed countries underlies this decrease in infectious and parasitic dis eases. As for the increase in cardiovascular and cancer mortalities, this is associated with an increase in the lifespan, so that people began to attain the age when these diseases are prevalent. As for an increase in the rate of the remaining mortality causes, this to a con siderable degree is a sad side effect caused by the devel opment of our civilization, namely, an increase in the number of road traffic injuries, occupational acci dents, and casualties. Figure 2 shows the causes of mortality in Russia in 2000 and 2009 according to the Goskomstat (State Statistics Committee) of the Russian Federation. The share of cardiovascular diseases declined over these 9 years, as well as the technogenic mortality, homi cides, and suicides, whereas the share of cancer dis eases increased. Similar to developed countries, infec tious diseases as a mortality cause in Russia are the fifth in the list. However, the global ratio of mortality causes in general differs from that in Russia, since three fourths of the world's population lives in devel oping and undeveloped countries, where the mortality of infectious diseases is still high. There is only one sig nificant difference between Russia and several devel oped countries, namely, the cardiovascular mortality in this country is considerably higher compared to cancer mortality in countries such as Japan, United States, and Norway, where these mortalities are almost equal. Thus, the mortality caused by infectious dis eases in the countries with developed vaccination against infections and proper control over drinking water quality is the fifth in the list of mortality causes versus first position in countries not implementing these measures.",

It is evident that rotaviruses account for 45% of such infections; astroviruses, for 7%; cali civiruses and adenoviruses, for 1% each; and the remaining infections are caused by bacteria and yet unknown pathogens. Thus, viruses cause over 60% of all gastrointestinal diseases in children in developing countries. However, intestinal infections account for only 2-3% of all human infectious diseases, whereas the main human infections cause respiratory diseases. At the beginning of the 21st century, the etiological causes of such infections were investigated in Michi gan, United States (Monto, 2002) . It has emerged that the major part of these diseases is caused by rhinovi ruses (Fig. 4) followed by coronaviruses. The influenza virus is only the third in this list, parainfluenza and res piratory syncytial viruses are fourth, followed by bac teria, a small share of adenovirus infections, and the group of undistinguished infections accounting for the remaining 20%. Note that influenza is in third place since this is only a respiratory infection for which vac cines are available and used. At the beginning of the 21st century, human metapneumoviruses were discov ered and characterized; these pathogens cause 5 to 12% of respiratory infections (Kahn, 2003; Hoogen et al., 2003; Williams et al., 2004) . Thus, it is likely that unknown infections in this diagram are by approxi mately 25-50% determined by metapneumoviruses. Correspondingly, viral pathogens cause over 70% of all the respiratory diseases, which is a slightly higher share compared to gastrointestinal diseases.",

            "text": "Another illustration of the emerging infections is the latest data on the origin of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). From the moment this virus was discovered, it has been assumed that it jumped to humans from monkeys. However, a hepatitis virus isolated from dogs in 2011 displayed a high homology to the human HCV (Kapoor et al., 2011) . First, this virus was detected in dogs and named canine hepatitis virus (CHV), since it was localized to the liver (only five dogs that died of an unknown gastrointestinal disease were examined). Interestingly, the CHV RNA amount detectable in the respiratory samples was larger compared to the liver samples. Further bioinformatics analysis of the CHV genome has demonstrated that it is genetically closer to HCV than the analogous monkey viruses and that HCV and CHV are likely to have a common ancestor, which formed two branches approximately 500 to 1000 years ago, much later than the dog was domesti cated. Possibly, hepaciviruses are mainly canine viruses and the human HCV emerged via selection of CHV in the human host. An alternative scenario, which cannot be excluded, is that hepaciviruses infect many animal species, so the chain of events could have been the reverse. Verification of this hypothesis requires screening other animal species for the hepa civiruses related to human HCV.",

            "text": "Eradicated infections and infections with eradica tion on track. This type of virus threats are related to diseases such as smallpox, poliomyelitis, measles, hepatitis B, and mumps. It is known that humankind successfully eradicated smallpox, a severe disease. It is also known that the global program for polio eradica tion, as well as the preparatory activities for the eradi cation of measles and hepatitis B, is in progress. How ever, use of molecular biological and genetic tools in virus research has revealed a number of rather curious facts. In particular, the ancestor of variola virus was found. To everyone's surprise, this ancestor is not the monkeypox virus but rather the cowpox virus, which according to the current concept is a virus of small rodents living in barns and cow sheds. This is evident from the phylogenetic tree for representatives of the genus Orthopoxvirus ( Fig. 9 ; modified from Esposito and Fenner, 2001) . Roman numerals denote different phylogenetic groups of orthopoxviruses (variola viruses, I; cowpox viruses, III; and monkeypox viruses, IV). It is evident that the natural ancestor of the smallpox agent is abundant in nature and the pos sibility that the evolutionary transformation that once took place may be repeated to bring about a virus sim ilar in its pathogenicity to the variola virus-most dangerous to the human population, which has no immunity to it-cannot be excluded. Thus, the con tinuing development of a new and better vaccine against this disease is completely justified by this fact rather than by the threat of bioterrorism.",

We know that Edward Jenner vaccinated humans with the crusts of ill cows, since he noticed that milk maids did not fall ill with smallpox. However, the study of the genomes of the modern vaccinia viruses has demonstrated that they are closer to buffalopox viruses rather than to the cowpox virus. Archival research has found that Chinese and Hindus in the 18th century used to rub buffalopox crusts into the human skin. Moreover, there is written evidence that a retired English colonel on his return from India tried to intro duce this in England but failed to win the confidence of the English, since he was not a physician. Thus, the current vaccinia virus most likely originated from the buffalopox virus rather than the cowpox virus, although Jenner possibly used the latter virus.",

For example, the poliovirus in 2001 was exported from Afghanistan to Uzbekistan and then to Tajikistan and Russia. There were only a few cases of the disease but many doses of polio vaccine and much medical effort were necessary to prevent the spread of the outbreak. There is also a concern associ ated with the possible evolution of related viruses. As is evident from the phylogenetic tree for the genus of enteroviruses (Fig. 10) countries using a live polio vaccine. Now the coxsack ievirus A21 morbidity is slowly increasing in developed countries which have ceased using the live vaccine.

Note that enteroviruses are rapidly evolving; thus, the cox sackievirus A21 might well mutate and become no less pathogenic for humans as the poliovirus; if the vacci nation against the poliovirus stops, humankind will be unprotected against this disease. Thus, even if the ces sation of the antismallpox vaccination is justified, it is hardly reasonable to stop vaccinating against poliomy elitis, since related viruses may evolve and cause infec tious diseases. Infections related to drug addiction. An upsurge in drug addiction in Russia in the 1990s enhanced the active spread of several infections (HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C). The problem was worsened by the use of nondisposable syringes. The result of all this at the turn of the century is illustrated in Fig. 11 by the exam ple of hepatitis C. The rise in drug addiction in Russia was determined by the tense moral atmosphere in this country after the default of 1998 and a rapid increase in the drug flow from Afghanistan. Almost immedi ately after American troops were brought to Afghani stan, the Federal Drug Control Service of Russia was established, and both these facts enhanced a drastic decrease in drug addiction in this country. A gradual reduction is also currently being observed due to, first, the effort of the Tajikistan frontier forces, as well as the Russian frontier troops, customs, and antidrug ser vices focused on the control of drug flows. For exam ple, considerably larger amounts of drugs are currently seized at the border compared to 2000. In addition, the antidrug informational campaign has been consid erably intensified in Russia, although not to the level anticipated based on the severe situation with drug addiction in Russia.",

The fact that crude drug purification most likely included the stage of sorbing impurities with the help of rejected donor blood preparations from Afghanistan infected with HCV may be one of the probable explanations. When our research team was publishing these data in 2004 (Shustov et al., 2005) , it was difficult to pass the review for an international journal without providing such an explanation, since these data looked most unusual (note that the analyzed population comprised 3000 individuals).

In particular, the inhibitors of genomic transcriptase (the stage when genomic RNA is transformed into cDNA) is currently one of the most widespread medications against HIV; note that the inhibitors of both nucleotide and nonnu cleotide natures have been discovered and are used. These inhibitors are frequently used together, since viruses soon develop resistance when only one drug is applied. The second white label denotes inhibitors of the enzyme integrase, which inserts viral RNA into host chromosome; these inhibitors may also either be nucle otide analogs or have a nonnucleotide nature. Finally, protease inhibitors have been developed (the third label), which are used together with the first two drug types.

The US Government spent about 100 mil lion dollars to prevent the spread of this infection from post sorting stations and protect those who contacted these envelopes. For this purpose, information and pre vention stations were organized and over 20000 people were recommended to take antibiotics for 60 days. Molecular epidemiology tools were used to character ize specific genetic features of the detected anthrax strain, which allowed, first, the laboratory where the strains were supposedly taken to be detected and then the particular person who did it to be traced. Indeed, the anthrax agent is a bacterium rather than a virus; yet molecular epidemiological analysis of several gene sequences of a number of strains identified the refriger ator that housed the mailed bacilli with limited access to it. The supposed offender was detected among these authorized persons and appeared to have a psychiatric deviation (www.anthraxinvestigation.com).",

An annual medical examination showed that she was infected with HCV and HIV 1, although one year earlier her blood tests did not show any infection. She led a healthy life and the only per son she closely contacted was her partner, a physician by background, who did her injections for some catarrhal disease; that is why he was suspected. Genet icists sequenced the genomes of the isolates recovered from her samples and compared them to the genome sequences of his patients who never contacted this woman. The sequences appeared identical, and this physician got a long sentence. This is the first instance in the world when molecular epidemiology tools led to a deserved sentence of a guilty person. Now this approach is used to trace epidemiological chains in the transmission of HIV infection, as well as stages in the evolution of influenza and some other viruses. This is becoming a routine approach when study ing the transmission pathways of viruses and their evolu tion. Thus, molecular biological methods have become appropriate tools for the investigation of crimes, epide miological chains, and evolution of viruses.",

This method was used before the advent of enzyme immu noassay. However, it is almost out of use now, since it is difficult to supplement and safely maintain the neces sary set of specific bacteriophages (Schlegel, 1987) . Treatment of bacterial diseases. Some highly specific bacteriophages are able to rapidly lyse only their own host bacteria. Earlier, this approach was used to treat diphthe ria. Bacteriophages were applied only topically, because some difficulties with the storage of bacteriophages made them insufficiently pure for administering to humans. Currently, this approach is experiencing a rebirth and is being used against the strains with multiple drug resis tance. In particular, this method could be promising for treatment of tuberculosis (Br\u00fcssow, 2007) .",

It has long ago been demonstrated that viruses better reproduce in cancer cells as compared to normal ones. This feature can be boosted by modifying viruses. In addition, certain genes can be introduced into virus genomes to enhance the apoptosis of cancer cells. Two types of adenoviruses have been approved for clinical administration in China. In the United States, over 30 phase I and II clinical trials are in progress now to verify virus based therapies for different cancer types (according to www.clinicaltrials.gov). However, some problems still exist, since the viruses of certain families lyse the cancer cells only with specific defects that determine their cancer transformation. Such defects have been so far detected for only some tumor types, so that the viruses can be used with good predictability. We have to find out many things about the genetic nature of cancer to know which viruses are most effi cient against particular cell types.",

Such a pattern is also being established in Germany and many other countries. Pay attention to the two following examples. The TBE morbidity in Austria, which developed the anti TBE vaccine as early as the 1980s and was the first manufacturer of such a vaccine in Europe, cardinally decreased after launching mass vaccination. As for Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, countries which apparently ceased vaccinating against TBE after the collapse of the Soviet Union, TBE morbidity increased. Currently, the Baltic countries have started purchasing the anti TBE vaccine (most probably, in Austria and Germany, as well as in Russia, since the Russian vaccine is as good as those produced in Austria and Germany but is less expensive).In the past two decades, the degree to which the Middle European TBE virus strains differ from the Siberian strains has been clarified. It was earlier believed that the TBE virus of only the Central Euro pean genotype circulated in Europe; this genotype being considerably different from the Siberian one.",
