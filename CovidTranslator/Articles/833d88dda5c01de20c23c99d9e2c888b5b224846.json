Immunization therapy is the most effective measure for new infections, but millions of the HBV patients will eventually succumb to the infection sequence due to vaccine failure [4] . Interferona and polyethylene glycol interferon-a are used as anti-HBV agents clinically, however, their application is limited for low curing rate and serious side effects (influenza-like symptoms, fatigue, myalgia, nausea, headache, etc.) [5, 6] . Five nucleoside drugs, lamivudine (3TC), adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), entecavir (ETV), telbivudine (LdT) and tenofovir-DF (TDF), have been approved by FDA for HBV treatment. The disadvantages of nucleosides, such as drug resistance and high recurrence, are becoming an important clinical issue because of the single target [6e8]. New strategies aiming at viral suppression, promoting virologic clearance and preventing drug resistance are fascinating topics [9] . Therefore, novel anti-HBV agents with unique antiviral target and mechanism are still needed.",

After chemical modification, its more active derivative 8e1 ( Fig. 1 ) was obtained [13e17] . Oxymatrine ( Fig. 1 ) and its derivatives showed anti-HBV activity through suppressing host heat-stress cognate 70 (Hsc70) expression [18] .

For example, cinnamic acid (2, Fig. 2 ) could inhibit HIV/SARS-CoV S pseudovirus [33] , and the cholesteryl conjugated with the 3, 4-dimethoxy cimmamic acid (3, Fig. 2 ) could enhance the anti-poliovirus type 1 (PV1) activity [44] . Caffeic acid (3, 4dihydroxycinnamic acid, 4, Fig. 2 ) and chlorogenic acid (the ester of 3, 4-dihydroxycinnamic acid with quinic acid, 5, Fig. 2 ) showed potent anti-HBV activity in vivo and in vitro [45] , which suggested that the molecular with cinnamic acid moiety might show potent anti-HBV activity. Meanwhile, cinnamic acid has been widely applied as a food additive with good safety [46] . Molecular hybrids with two pharmacophores often lead to synergistic activity [47, 48] . Thus, the combination of caudatin with cinnamic acids as novel anti-HBV agents was designed, which was anticipated that the hybrids could enhance the anti-HBV activity and decrease the cytotoxicity. Herein, we reported the chemical modification and HBV inhibitory properties of caudatin derivatives designed by molecular hybridization. The most active compound 18 was further investigated for the mechanism of action on HBV promoters (preC\u2044pregenomic, S1, S2 and X promoters) and enhancers (ENI and ENII), as well as the acute toxicity in mice.",

An exception is that compound 11 was obtained starting from caudatin and 3, 4-dihydroxycinnamic acid in the presence of diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD) and triphenylphosphine (TPP) (Scheme 1) [49] . Generally, the introduction of fluorine is useful to alter the physical properties, binding characteristics, and metabolic disposition in developing drug leads [50] , thus various fluorinated cinnamic acids were used to react with caudatin. The structures of the synthesized derivatives (Table 1) were identified by spectroscopic means ( 1 H, 13 C NMR and MS).

The result of compound 18 (10 m\u039c) in the luciferase reporter assay was shown in Fig. 3 (Cells viability was up to 97.4% and 85.6% at 48 h and 72 h, respectively according to the MTT assay). Compound 18 mainly inhibited 5.6 times of the transcript activity of HBV X promoter (Xp) and increased 9.4 times of the HBV enhancer ENI compared with mock-treated control. HBV sequences are transcribed under the control of promoters and enhancers which are important for replication of HBV [51, 52] . The Xp regulates transcription of the small 0.9 kb mRNA sequence encoding HBV X protein (HBx), which plays an important role in stimulating HBV transcription and replication [53, 54] . The HBV ENI element takes a crucial effect in the overall liver-specific regulation of HBV gene expression [55] . Thus, compound 18 might exert anti-HBV activity by interfering promoters and enhancers to influence HBV transcriptions. Considering that there are about 20 nucleotides overlapped between the minimal Xp sequence and the 3 0 end of the ENI [56e58], compound 18 was presumed to simultaneously influence Xp and ENI on the overlapped region. Further studies are needed to clarify how compound 18 takes effect and which region responds exactly. Nucleoside analogs can suppress HBV replication by inhibiting HBV polymerase and terminating premature DNA chain, but do not directly affect the HBV gene expression [59] . Compound 18 exhibits anti-HBV activities by interfering HBV gene expression instead of inhibiting HBV DNA polymerase, which is different from those of the nucleoside analogs.",
