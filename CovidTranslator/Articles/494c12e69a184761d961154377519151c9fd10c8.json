Currently, one of the most relevant genotypes circulating worldwide is IBV-QX (GI-19), for which vaccines have been developed by passaging virulent QX strains in embryonated chicken eggs. Here we explored the attenuated phenotype of a commercially available QX live vaccine, IB Primo QX, in specific pathogens free broilers. At hatch, birds were inoculated with QX vaccine or its virulent progenitor IBV-D388, and postmortem swabs and tissues were collected each day up to eight days post infection to assess viral replication and morphological changes. In the trachea, viral RNA replication and protein expression were comparable in both groups. Both viruses induced morphologically comparable lesions in the trachea, albeit with a short delay in the vaccinated birds. In contrast, in the kidney, QX vaccine viral RNA was nearly absent, which coincided with the lack of any morphological changes in this organ. This was in contrast to high viral RNA titers and abundant lesions in the kidney after IBV D388 infection. Furthermore, QX vaccine showed reduced ability to reach and replicate in conjunctivae and intestines including cloaca, resulting in significantly lower titers and delayed protein expression, respectively. Nephropathogenic IBVs might reach the kidney also via an ascending route from the cloaca, based on our observation that viral RNA was detected in the cloaca one day before detection in the kidney. In the kidney distal tubular segments, collecting ducts and ureter were positive for viral antigen. Taken together, the attenuated phenotype of QX vaccine seems to rely on slower dissemination and lower replication in target tissues other than the site of inoculation.",

IBV initially targets the epithelium of the respiratory tract, but depending on the viral strain it can also infect other organs, mostly the reproductive tract and the kidneys.

As a result the virus adapts to the embryo, with a concomitant attenuation for hatched, juvenile and adult chickens [11] [12] [13] . Similarly, QX field virulent strains have been attenuated via passage in embryonated chicken eggs [14] . The basis of the attenuation of live IBV vaccines and its effects on the resulting phenotype are, however, poorly understood. Here we set out to elucidate the attenuated phenotype of the QX vaccine, NOBILIS \u00d2 IB Primo, by comparing its viral replication, protein expression and induction of lesions in various target tissues to that of its progenitor, IBV-D388 [9] . Viral distribution was investigated at the site of inoculation, the trachea, and in the kidneys, conjunctivae and the gastrointestinal tract, specifically including the cloaca, over the first eight days after experimental infection of day-old broilers. Our data show that the attenuation of QX vaccine phenotypically results in reduced ability to spread and to replicate in tissues beyond the site of infection.",

A genotype QX specific SYBR Green qRT-PCR developed and validated in our laboratory [15] based on the S1 gene sequence was used to detect and quantify viral RNA. The limit of detection of the assay was equal to 10 1.31 EID 50 /100 ml. The qRT-PCR reactions were carried out in a Bio-Rad CFX Connect real-time PCR system. In each qRT-PCR round, three ten-fold dilutions of the positive control were used to create a standard curve to quantify the viral RNA in the samples.",

For histopathological examination, tissue slides of trachea and kidney were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE) according to standard laboratory procedures. Histopathologic changes were critically evaluated via light microscopy by two veterinary pathologists, who after individual evaluation came to a consensus. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on tissue slides as previously described by van Beurden et al. (2017) [16] , using a monoclonal antibody directed against the IBV S2 protein (Prionics-Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Percentages of cells showing viral protein expression were scored for each organ by light microscopic evaluation, similarly as described by van den Brand et al. (2011) [17] . For the trachea, this was done with the total piece of tissue divided into ten parts; in each tenth, the percentage of cells showing viral protein expression was defined in 10% increments. An average viral protein expression percentage for the total trachea was then calculated by dividing the total sum of the ten separate percentages by ten. For the kidney and cloaca, similar procedures were followed, but, due to the more variable tissue sample shape, each tissue piece was divided into five instead of ten parts for technical convenience. The GI tract was evaluated for presence of viral protein expression without percentage-wise scoring and with division of the total GI tract into four parts: (1) stomachs (proventriculus and gizzard), (2) small intestines (duodenum, jejunum, ileum), (3) large intestines (caeca, large intestinal segment connecting ileocaecal junction with cloaca) and (4) cloaca.",

In the birds' stomachs, a limited number of positive cells were observed in the gizzard, but not in the proventriculus.

            "text": "The ability of a virus to infect and replicate in tissues beyond the site of infection depends on the route of transport and the susceptibility of a respective organ. Since the 1960s, viremia has been proposed as one of the routes of IBV dissemination [18] , with only recent evidence for involvement of mononuclear cells in transportation of the virus throughout the body [19, 20] . In our study, mononuclear cells expressing viral proteins were only rarely detected (data not shown), so it is yet unclear whether they truly contribute to IBV dissemination. In addition, virions excreted by coughing, sneezing and rales, or taken up by ingestion, can contribute to the dissemination of the virus to other organs [1] . Our observation that comparable viral RNA levels for the virulent and vaccine strains were produced in the trachea, while lower or delayed viral RNA levels for the vaccine strain were detected in the cloaca and conjunctivae, suggests that the vaccine has a lower ability to reach or to infect these tissues. It is possible, however, that part of the viral RNA came from non-infectious viral particles, as the infectious dose produced was not determined in this study. The extent to which viral shedding from the trachea contributes to the lower viral RNA titres in the conjunctivae and cloaca remains to be confirmed. Other factors, including stability of the virus in various environmental conditions, susceptibility to immune factors, or intrinsic differences between the viruses to replicate in tissues distant from the initial site of infection may play an additional role in reduced replication in secondary organs. Kidneys from QX vaccine-inoculated animals rarely displayed signs of infection, with only a few animals showing very few virus-positive cells. Thus, attenuation of QX vaccine resulted in a virus with reduced ability to disseminate to this tissue. This is in accordance with a previous study in which passages of a QX virulent strain in embryonated eggs showed a progressive reduction in ability to replicate in the kidneys of experimentally infected chickens [14] . Kidney lesions induced by D388 did not, however, result in clinical symptoms usually observed in cases of nephritis [9, 21, 22] . Clinical respiratory symptoms in both groups were mild, but comparable (not shown). As the severity of IBV clinical symptoms also relies on environmental factors, including but not limited to cold and heat stress, food additives and the presence of secondary bacterial or viral infections [22] , the severity of clinical symptoms in an experimental setting is often less than in the field [23, 24] .",

This seems to be supported by the observation that epithelial cells of the distal tubules, collecting ducts and ureter commonly tend to show the only or more prominent viral protein expression, compared to the proximal nephron segments. Comparable observations supporting this theory were made in other studies [24] [25] [26] . The cloaca at least seems to be reached by the virus by a descending route via the gastrointestinal tract, likely after swallowing viral particles. Alternatively, the virus might reach the cloaca via an ascending process called cloacal suckling, with uptake of particles from the environment into the cloaca [27] after their excretion from, for example, airways or eyes. From this study, however, it is not clear whether such cloacal uptake of virus takes place.",
