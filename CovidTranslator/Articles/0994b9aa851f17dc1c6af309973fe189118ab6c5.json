We now demonstrate that SLPI binds to the membrane of human macrophages through the phospholipidbinding protein, annexin II. Based on the recent identification of human cell membrane phosphatidylserine (PS) in the outer coat of HIV-1, we define a novel role for annexin II, a PS-binding moiety, as a cellular cofactor supporting macrophage HIV-1 infection. Moreover, this HIV-1 PS interaction with annexin II can be disrupted by SLPI or other annexin II-specific inhibitors. The PS-annexin II connection may represent a new target to prevent HIV-1 infection.",

One of the first novel non-antiprotease functions identified for SLPI was its ability to inhibit HIV-1 infection of macrophages, which appeared to be effected through interaction with unidentified host cell molecules and not the virus (2, 3) . In addition to CD4, macrophages express CCR5 and CXCR4 that function as HIV-1 envelope gp120 coreceptors (10) , and once colonized by HIV-1, can function as stable reservoirs of the virus, thereby facilitating transmission of HIV-1 to CD4 \u03e9 lymphocytes (11, 12) . Persistent evidence favors the existence of additional cofactors for binding and/or entry of HIV-1, including components of the host cell membrane acquired during viral budding (13) . Among these host-derived constituents in the viral envelope is the phospholipid, phosphatidylserine (PS; reference 14) , which predicts a potential interactive molecule on the receptive host cell that may facilitate virus binding, entry, and/or fusion.",

            "text": "Despite tremendous efforts over the last decade, a cell surface receptor for SLPI has remained elusive. To decipher the mechanisms by which SLPI regulates target cell functions independent of protease inhibition, we searched for a membrane-binding protein/receptor for SLPI on mononuclear phagocytes that are susceptible to its antiinflammatory and antiviral activities (2) (3) (4) (6) (7) (8) . In this study, we document that SLPI binding to the macrophage cell membrane involves annexin II. Annexin II is a member of the larger annexin gene family and contains a variable NH 2 -terminal tail, a COOH-terminal region with heparin and plasminogen-binding sites, and the core domain, which includes binding sites for Ca 2 \u03e9 , phospholipids, and F-actin (15) (16) (17) (18) . Characterized by a highly conserved set of \u2423 -helical repeats that mediate membrane binding, annexin II exists as a monomer (p36) or a heterotetramer constructed of two p36 and two p11(S100A10) subunits, and traffics to the cell surface by an unknown mechanism (18) . Although implicated in exocytosis and endocytosis pathways, as well as in ion channel activity and stimulation of DNA replication (17) , annexin II has not previously been linked to HIV-1. Nonetheless, annexin II has recently been identified as a receptor for CMV (19) and respiratory syncytial virus (20) , prompting our exploration of a potential role for annexin II in HIV-1 infection and as a conduit for inhibition by SLPI and/or other targeted interventions in the battle against AIDS.",

Based on the link between SLPI, a known antagonist of HIV-1 infection (2, 3) , and annexin II, we attempted to abort infection by directly blocking annexin II. A single treatment of adherent macrophages with an antibody targeting the NH 2 -terminal tail of annexin II (Fig. 4, A and B) , but not the carboxy terminus (not depicted) nor an IgG isotype control (Fig. 4 B) , during the initial infection process resulted in significant (\u03fe90%) and durable (\u03fe14 d) suppression of R5 HIV-1 BaL infection. Infection was monitored by HIV-1 p24 antigen levels (Fig. 4) and by ultrastructural evidence of viral replication (not depicted). Furthermore, decreased expression of annexin II using RNA-mediated interference (RNAi; Fig.  4 C, inset) dramatically suppressed macrophage viral infection (Fig. 4 C) . Although suppression of annexin II protein by RNAi was not absolute, likely related to inability to transfect all cells and/or due to stability of intracellular annexin II, the reduced levels of annexin II were sufficient to interrupt the HIV-1 infection process, with the implication that there might be a threshold level of annexin II necessary for optimal infection. Furthermore, to establish that the suppression of viral infection was specific to annexin II levels, we monitored the macrophages treated with annexin II RNAi for CD4 and CCR5 expression in parallel. As evident by Western analysis (Fig. 4 D) and by flow cytometry (not depicted), no substantive change in these essential viral recognition and binding receptors was evident, consistent with a contributing role for annexin II in the macrophage infection process.",

Consistent with SLPI (2, 3), blockade of annexin II on macrophages did not significantly interrupt HIV-1 binding to the cells (Fig. 5 C) , likely dissociating it from a direct interaction with CD4 and/or CCR5. In confirmatory studies, anti-annexin II was incorporated into a fusion assay in which effector cells expressing recombinant Env, but lacking viral PS, were cocultured with target cells expressing recombinant CD4 and coreceptors (23) . In the absence of PS, anti-annexin II was ineffective in interrupting this fusion process (not depicted), ruling out a specific interaction with Env, CD4, and/or coreceptors. These data emphasize the potential unique constraints of macrophage-HIV-1 entry events that might be optimized through an annexin II-PS cofactor linkage. Although the role of annexin II in viral entry may involve participation in internalization or structural/functional facilitation of fusion events, it was unclear whether membrane annexin II had intracellular access. Because apoptotic cells also bind through PS to annexin II on macrophages (24, 25), we exposed macrophages to apoptotic Jurkat cells (PS \u03e9 ) as a model of annexin II-dependent internalization. By immunofluorescence, annexin II could be found within the early phagosome membrane, consistent with surface membrane internalization (Fig. 5 D) . Whether internalization is essential to viral entry is under investigation, but by multiple criteria, the role of annexin II appears instrumental early in the infection process. To confirm that disconnecting the HIV-annexin II bond inhibits the virus Figure 4 . Annexin II as a cofactor in HIV infection. (A) Adherent macrophages in 48-well plates were treated or not with 25 g/ml anti-annexin II for 60 min at 37\u040aC before infection with M tropic HIV-1 BaL for 2 h, the unbound virus was washed away, and the cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS. Every 2-3 d, aliquots of supernatants were removed, replaced with fresh medium, and tested for HIV-1 p24 antigen. (B) Macrophages, treated or not with anti-annexin, IgG, or SLPI for 60 min, were infected with HIV-1 and 14-d supernatants were tested for p24. A representative experiment (n \u03ed 4) is shown. (C) SiRNA sequences 1, 2, and control (cSi) were transfected into monocytes using the Amaxa Nucleofector kit, in parallel with an electroporation control (EP) and an untreated control (Ctrl). The cells were incubated 6 d before analysis of annexin protein by Western (inset) and infection with HIV-1. Supernatants were assayed for HIV-1 p24 10 d after infection (n \u03ed 5). (D) Macrophages treated with siRNA as indicated in C were analyzed for annexin II, CD4, and CCR5 protein by Western blot. (E) Macrophages were treated with anti-annexin II, infected with HIV-1 JRCSF (JRC; TCID50 \u03ed 250/ml), ADA (TCID50 \u03ed 10,000/ml), or primary isolate Clade B 92US712 (TCID50 \u03ed 1,000/ml), washed, and cultured, with supernatants collected for p24 ELISA every 2-3 d for 12 d.

The presence of anti-annexin II during the initial virus inoculation period dramatically inhibited subsequent viral DNA synthesis, as demonstrated by the HIV-1-specific 730-bp PCR product (Fig. 5 E) , even though annexin II blockade did not disengage the viral-binding step (Fig. 5 C) . Collectively, these data indicate that interference with macrophage membrane annexin II inhibits infectivity after binding, but pre-reverse transcription, consistent with a stranglehold on the viral entry/fusion step.",

Striking was the ability of inhibitors of annexin II to mimic the kinetics and apparent mechanism of HIV-1 suppression by SLPI, denoting a shared site of action. Although not ruling out additional binding targets for SLPI, annexin II appears to be significant in mediating its anti-HIV-1 activity. Subsequent to binding of HIV-1 to the canonical receptors, CD4 and CCR5, HIV-1 fuses with the host cell membrane that might be facilitated by viral envelope PS (14) . PS is not encoded by HIV-1, but rather is acquired from its host cell membrane as it exits the cells (26) . During viral assembly at the cell surface or within cytoplasmic vesicles, cell membrane components become incorporated into the new viral coat along with virally encoded gp120/gp41. The resulting mosaic HIV-1 envelope represents a lipid bilayer with a unique cholesterol/phospholipid composition, embracing viral and host molecules, including PS. Although PS enhances infection, it does not mediate initial binding of the virus to the target cells (14), Figure 5 . Virus binding to annexin II. (A) Nunc immunoplates were coated with the indicated proteins overnight at 4\u040aC, washed, and 100 l HIV-1 (10 4 /ml) was added for 1 h at 4\u040aC.

            "text": "Annexin II may represent a molecular pathway exploited by HIV-1 unique to macrophage hosts and thus, a potential target to block their virus susceptibility. Both laboratoryadapted and clinical M tropic isolates appear to coopt this host cell bridge into the cell's interior. Whether annexin II selectively boosts the viral entry/fusion process or possibly also influences pathways involved in HIV-1-mediated macrophage signaling, viral DNA transport, or subsequent virion construction, budding and release remains to be deciphered. Annexin II has the potential to traverse into intracellular compartments and interaction of annexin II with the actin cytoskeleton may not only facilitate internalization, but also the trafficking of HIV-1 within the cell and/or represent the scaffolding for viral transcription (30) . Nonetheless, our data support a dominant role of annexin II to be in the early steps of the infection process, preceding reverse transcription. Annexin II may represent one of multiple potential cofactors, such as syndecan and human neutrophil elastase (31, 32) , which independently or collaboratively might be usurped by HIV-1 to facilitate the infectious process. Because annexin II is a membrane-associated protein, best known as a docking station for tissue plasminogen activator/plasminogen (16) , it is unclear if it transduces a signal because it lacks a hydrophobic signal sequence, but conceivably, may serve as an adaptor in a signaling cascade. Annexin II can be phosphorylated at key residues by several kinases, including the src oncogene (17) and Pyk-2 (15), a tyrosine kinase activated by HIV-1 (33, 34) , but such a pathway awaits delineation. Although less persuasive due to the temporal association of SLPI/anti-annexin II inhibition with preintegration events, SLPI may also influence NF-B activation and/or proteasome inhibition (6, 8) , both of which are requisite in an optimal infection process (35) (36) (37) .",

            "text": "Whether the relative lack of abundance of annexin II on the perimeter of immature blood monocytes compared with mature macrophages influences their differential permissiveness to HIV-1 infection is of interest. A related, intriguing question is whether the viral tropism characteristic of T cell and macrophage targets bears any association with their divergent annexin II expression. Annexin II on mac-rophages may preferentially facilitate entry of virions expressing PS acquired during exit from prior macrophage hosts or from T cells undergoing apoptosis that only then express PS on their outer membrane leaflet (38, 39) , as compared with virions budded from PS-less viable T cells. R5 viruses mediate both mucosal and blood-borne transmission of HIV-1 infection, whereas the X4 (T tropic) viruses typically abound in the later stages of disease during clinical progression to AIDS (11, 40, 41) . Moreover, when infected T cells succumb to apoptosis, recognition of their newly exposed PS will promote clearance by annexin IIbearing macrophages with the potential for HIV-1 transfer (42) . It is conceivable that PS-annexin II interactions in the cytoplasmic vesicles and late endosomes of macrophages, where structural assembly of virions occurs (12, 43) and annexin II is found (28) , not only serve as a construction scaffolding, but also as a tether to retain virions intracellularly in a covert maneuver to avoid detection at the cell surface. Because the S100A10 component of the annexin II complex has been shown to facilitate arbovirus exocytosis (44), such a role in HIV-1 egress might also be considered. Annexin II/PS may also contribute to the host cell-derived cloak of the hypothetical Trojan exosomes that subversively deliver retroviral particles to nearby cells (45) , thus a co-conspirator with HIV-1 both going in and coming out.",

Nonetheless, as macrophages may contribute to initial viral selection, dissemination, and transmission of virus to CD4 \u03e9 T cells, and serve as long-term covert reservoirs of HIV-1 (11, 40, 46) , this would be an enviable goal. Particularly evident is the enormous viral burden in macrophages in later stage HIV-1/AIDS during opportunistic infections (12, 21, 22) . Further unraveling of the complex interplay between viral envelope and macrophage membrane constituents remains crucial to the development of antiviral agents active before permanent viral integration into the host cell genome when the virus is most vulnerable. The persistence of HIV-1 infection, coupled with its incredible mutation rate and insular reservoirs, focuses attention on host cell constituents usurped by the virus as potential intervention targets. In this regard, annexin II, a host cell molecule that the virus has appropriated for easing its entrance into the host cell, represents a likely candidate, and SLPI, an endogenous ligand for annexin II, or other annexin II-specific blockades, may represent a therapeutic impediment to the infection process. Clearly, viral pathogens other than HIV-1, including CMV and respiratory syncytial virus (19, 20) , also take advantage of target cell annexin II to enhance their infectivity and/or dissemination, and furthermore, bacteria trigger annexin II recruitment to their attachment sites (27) , all suggesting its broader involvement in microbial entrance and pathogenesis. ter) for helpful advice and support.
