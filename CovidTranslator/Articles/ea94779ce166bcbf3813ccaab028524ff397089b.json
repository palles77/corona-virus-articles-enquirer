            "text": "Linear plasmids with almost identical compact genetic organization have been found in the cytoplasm of yeast species from nine genera. We employed pGKL1,2 plasmids from Kluyveromyces lactis as a model to investigate the previously unstudied transcriptome of yeast cytoplasmic linear plasmids. We performed 5' and 3' RACE analysis of all the pGKL1,2 mRNAs and found them not 3' polyadenylated and containing mostly uncapped 5' poly(A) leaders that are not complementary to the plasmid DNA. The degree of 5' capping and/or 5' polyadenylation is specific to each gene and is controlled by the corresponding promoter regions. We refined the description of the pGKL1,2 promoters and found new alternative promoters of several genes. We also provide evidence that K2ORF3 encodes an mRNA cap guanine-N 7 -methyltransferase and that 5' capped pGKL1,2 transcripts contain N 7 -methylated caps. Translation of pGKL1,2 transcripts is enhanced in lsm1\u0394 and pab1\u0394 strains and is independent of eIF4E and Pab1 translation factors. We suggested a model of a primitive regulation of pGKL1,2 plasmids gene expression where degree of 5' mRNA capping, degree of 5' non-template polyadenylation and presence of negative regulators as PAB1 and Lsm1 play an important role. Our data also suggest a close relationship between linear plasmids and poxviruses. doi: bioRxiv preprint 4 synthesized in a template-independent manner. We show that plasmid promoters directly determine the formation of the mRNA 5' end leaders and their capping, pointing to a possible role of the plasmid RNA polymerase in this unusual phenomenon. We also provide the first evidence that MTase is an essential part of the K2Orf3p enzyme and that capped pGKL mRNAs are methylated at the N 7 position of the terminal guanosine moiety. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we demonstrate that translation of plasmid-specific mRNAs is independent of major cellular cap-binding proteins, translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and the Pab1 and Lsm1 proteins that were speculated to be possible translational enhancers and/or stabilizers of cellular and viral mRNAs bearing 5' poly(A) stretches (38,39). Our results thus suggest the existence of a novel translation initiation mechanism.",

This type of construct was prepared by fusion PCR; for the organization of such a construct, see Fig. 2A . After transformation, yeast cells were plated onto selective agar media, and their DNA content was analyzed for the presence of the modified pGKL plasmid using agarose electrophoresis. Both modified and wild-type target plasmids were usually detected after transformation. Colonies containing both the modified and wild-type target plasmids were selected and cultivated under selective conditions for approximately 60 generations and analyzed using agarose electrophoresis. For subsequent analysis, only colonies containing a modified version of the target plasmid were used. All constructs were verified using colony PCRs and subsequent sequencing of amplified products.",

These results are in good agreement with the previously described results of Tiggemann and co-workers (17), who had shown that K2Orf3p possesses TPase and GTase activities in vitro but not MTase activity. They explained this result by using a C-terminal His-tag for the heterologous production of the K2Orf3p capping enzyme that may have interfered with the C-terminal MTase domain (17).

We constructed yeast plasmids pYX212::NLS-K2ORF3 and pYX213::NLS-K2ORF3, which had been designed to produce K2Orf3p fused with an SV40 nuclear localization signal under the control of either a strong constitutive triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) promoter or a tightly regulated GAL1 promoter, respectively. These plasmids were introduced into the S. cerevisiae strains carrying either ceg1 ts or abd1 ts temperature-sensitive alleles (62, 63) . We detected no growth in any of the resulting yeast strains at the restrictive temperature (data not shown). Multiple reasons can explain such a result. K2Orf3p may need to be artificially forced to interact with the Cterminal domain of RNA polymerase II or may require another co-factor for its proper function. The former approach was used to study an N-terminal fragment of the vaccinia virus capping enzyme D1 (AAs 1-545) in yeast, where it was produced as a protein fused with part of the mouse capping enzyme Mce1 (AAs 211-597).

A similar approach was also used to test the N 7 methyltransferase activities of viral capping enzymes (65, 66) . On the other hand, some cap methyltransferases, including Hcm1 (from human), do not require any auxiliary factors to be co-expressed to support yeast growth in lieu of the Abd1 protein (54, 58, 66) . We should notice that the vaccinia virus D1 protein itself displays mild MTase activity (48), and we complemented the temperature-sensitive phenotype, allowing us to follow the yet unobserved complementation of a partial loss of Abd1 activity in cells. Another, and perhaps the most likely, explanation why K2Orf3p does not complement the mRNA capping machinery in yeast temperature-sensitive mutants is based on the recent observation that expression of AT-rich pGKL genes in yeast nuclei does not lead to functional products due to the frequent premature 3' polyadenylation of the resulting mRNAs (67) .",

Briefly, we purified total RNA from the K. lactis IFO1267 strain, treated it with DNase I, synthesized cDNA using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase and random primers, G-tailed the cDNA using dGTP and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and amplified the 5' regions corresponding to transcripts from individual ORFs by PCR with an anchored oligo(dC) primer and an appropriate genespecific primer (see primer sequences in Table S2 ).

Expression plasmids for the production of His-tagged Dcp2 and Rai1 proteins were obtained from Prof. Mike Kiledjian (Rutgers University) and Prof. Liang Tong (Columbia University), respectively. Both proteins were produced in the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain and purified to homogeneity exactly as described by Xiang S. et al. in 2009 (79) . We purified total RNA from the killer K. lactis IFO1267 strain for cap-methylation analysis. The total RNA was DNase I-treated and subsequently incubated with either purified Rai1 decapping enzyme, which removes unmethylated caps only (80), or purified hDcp2 decapping enzyme, which removes both methylated and unmethylated caps from the 5' ends of mRNAs (81,82). To control for the proper function of both mRNA decapping enzymes, we used in vitro-transcribed RNA corresponding to the first 579 nt (including 32 nt of the 5' UTR) of the K. lactis ACT gene, which encodes actin, (EnsemblFungi Id: KLLA0_D05357g) that had been capped using the vaccinia virus capping enzyme in either the presence or absence of SAM and subsequently incubated with Rai1 or hDcp2 decapping enzymes. The workflow of the experiment is illustrated in Fig. 4A . Treatment of K. lactis total RNA with hDcp2 significantly decreased the number of capped pGKL mRNAs represented by the originally highly capped transcripts from K2ORF1 and K2ORF2 genes, whereas treatment with Rai1 had no such effect.

These values correspond very well to the level of 5' capping and nontemplate polyadenylation of K1ORF1 mRNAs expressed from the pGKL1 plasmid under control of natural K1UCR1 (Fig. 2E ). The same trend was also observed for the transcripts of the resistance marker gene G418, transcription of which was controlled by K1UCR2. The majority of these transcripts were uncapped, but all of them were 5' polyadenylated in exactly the same manner as natural K1ORF2 transcripts. The same promoter had been used to drive both G418 marker gene and K1ORF2 transcription. Additionally, the average number of nontemplate adenosine residues in the 5' leader was comparable in both genes (G418 resistance and K1ORF2) controlled by K1UCR2. All these findings strongly support the hypothesis that differences in 5' end formation of yeast linear plasmid mRNAs are controlled by UCR sequences and are independent of the coding sequence of a gene and its location within the pGKL plasmid system.",

            "text": "The unique 5' ends of the pGKL mRNAs immediately raised a question about the organization of their 3' ends. Previously reported indications suggested that pGKL mRNAs were polyadenylated at their 3' ends (18,87), which is reasonable, especially in the case of non-capped pGKL mRNAs, because 3' polyadenylation of eukaryotic mRNAs plays an important role in their stability (88,89) and the efficiency of their utilization by cellular translation apparatus (90-92). To answer this question, we performed a modified 3' RACE where a purified and DNase I-treated total yeast RNA was 3' tailed by an E. coli poly(A) polymerase using CTP instead of ATP. Following reverse transcription with an oligo(dG) anchored primer, PCR amplifications were performed with a universal anchor primer and appropriate gene-specific primers (see primer sequences in Table S2 ). At least twenty randomly selected 3' RACE fragments cloned in pCR4-TOPO plasmids were sequenced for each ORF. The 3' RACE analyses of all 15 pGKL ORFs are exemplified by the results from K1ORF1 ( Fig. 3B ; Table S1C), K2ORF5 and K2ORF10 (Table S1C) . Surprisingly, we found that pGKL mRNAs do not contain a 3' poly(A) tail. Transcripts produced from the pGKL plasmids contain heterogeneous 3' ends, suggesting the existence of more than one independent putative termination signal. Transcripts corresponding to only four ORFs are uniform at their 3' ends. This group is exemplified by K2ORF10 (Table S1C ). Four pGKL ORFs gave rise to transcripts that fell into two distinct groups with regard to their 3' UTR lengths, suggesting two independent transcription terminators. These transcripts are exemplified by those of K2ORF5 (Table S1C ). Transcripts of the remaining seven pGKL ORFs probably utilize three or more termination sites. Our initial bioinformatic analyses failed to determine the transcription termination signals. We detected only very weak RNA stem loops (\u2206G from -1.0 to -4.0) at the 3' UTR sequences that are probably not able to induce transcription termination.",

Because pGKL plasmids can be transferred and stably maintained in S. cerevisiae (97), we decided to test possible interaction between the S. cerevisiae eIF4E capbinding protein (S.c.-eIF4E) and pGKL mRNAs in vitro. We produced S.c.-eIF4E as an Nterminal GST fusion protein in E. coli and purified it by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. To test the possible binding of pGKL-specific mRNAs to the yeast eIF4E, we incubated DNase I-treated total RNA purified from K. lactis IFO1267 with the purified GST-S.c.-eIF4E fusion protein bound to the glutathione Sepharose. After 3 hours of incubation at room temperature, the slurry was extensively washed six times with a great excess of buffer I at room temperature and directly used for RT-PCRs with gene-specific primers. Fig. 5 clearly shows that pGKL mRNAs, represented by mRNA from K2ORF5, do not bind to yeast eIF4E in vitro, whereas cellular mRNAs, represented by mRNA coding for a high-affinity glucose transporter (HGT1), do. This result is further supported by qPCR analysis that revealed comparable abundances of K2ORF5 and HGT1 mRNAs in the K. lactis IFO1267 total RNA (data not shown). Interestingly, K2ORF5 is not one of the pGKL mRNAs with the low frequency of m 7 G cap occurrence at their 5' ends. An explanation could be that the strength of eIF4E binding to mRNA is highly influenced by the first proximal nucleotide following the terminal m 7 G, where the association constant K a is much higher for purines than .

Many similar results have been obtained by other researchers; however, cap analogs were used to determine the K a and K d values in most of these studies. Adding more nucleotides after the first proximal nucleotide substantially increased eIF4E binding to the cap while still preserving the differential influence of the first proximal nucleotide on eIF4E binding (99). A short homopolymeric stretch of 5' adenosine nucleotides thus might destabilize eIF4E binding to the mRNA cap. However, decreased eIF4E binding to the pGKL mRNAs does not substantially affect the performance of those mRNAs in translation, which suggests a novel mechanism of translation initiation independent of eIF4E cap-binding protein.",

At least three genes (K1ORF2, K1ORF3 and K1ORF4) encoded by the pGKL1 plasmid require sufficient expression in the yeast cells to impart killer and immunity phenotypes. The killer toxin itself is a trimeric protein comprising non-identical alpha, beta and gamma subunits that are encoded by K1ORF2 and K1ORF4 ( Fig. 1) (8,104) . Interestingly, mRNAs transcribed from all three genes belong to the group whose members have the lowest cap occurrence frequency and a high degree of 5' polyadenylation ( Fig. 3C) .

The resulting strains display K1 killer and immunity phenotypes at the permissive temperature (24\u00b0C) (Fig. 6B) . The experiment depicted in Fig. 6 shows a comparison of the production of the K. lactis toxin expressed naturally from the pGKL1 plasmid and the K1 toxin expressed artificially from the nuclear plasmid pYX212::M1. The K1 toxin gene was transcribed by RNA polymerase II in the nucleus and thus provided a 5' m 7 G-capped and 3' polyadenylated mRNA control. We cultivated all the CWO4 \u03c1 0 [pGKL1/2] and CWO4 \u03c1 0 [pYX212::M1] strains in parallel to the exponential phase at the permissive temperature (24\u00b0C). All the strains were then harvested and briefly washed three times with an excess of the fresh medium prewarmed to 24\u00b0C. Half of each culture was further cultivated at 24\u00b0C. The second half was rapidly transferred to fresh medium prewarmed to 37\u00b0C and further cultivated at this elevated temperature. At this point, initial samples marked zero were taken for biomass measurements and the determination of toxin activity in the culture medium. Toxin activities were undetected in all samples at time zero and provided clear evidence that all cultures were washed sufficiently and that the toxin activities present in samples taken after 3, 6 and 12 hours of cultivation corresponded to proteins produced only in the course of the experiment (Fig. 6) . The production of the K. lactis killer toxin in S. cerevisiae strains bearing pGKL plasmids was almost comparable under permissive and restrictive conditions, regardless of whether the wild-type or temperature-sensitive CDC33 allele was present ( Fig. 6A; 37\u00b0C) .

The presence of the temperature-sensitive eIF4E proteins in cdc33-1 and cdc33-42 yeast strains was documented by their restricted growth at 37\u00b0C. Both strains containing the wild-type allele of the CDC33 gene grew well at both 24 and 37\u00b0C (Fig. 6) . The growth of CWO4 CDC33, \u03c1 0 [pYX212::M1] was slightly slower at 24\u00b0C than at 37\u00b0C. The most likely reason is that K1 killer toxin is more active at 24\u00b0C than at 37\u00b0C, even though we cloned the coding sequence of the K1 super-killer variant that shows enhanced thermal stability (107). We previously showed that K1 preprotoxin produced artificially from the nuclear plasmid does not fully support the immunity phenotype of the host cells (106). Higher K1 toxin stability at 24\u00b0C thus probably led to the slightly slower growth. However, both cultures eventually reached comparable biomass, in contrast to the strains bearing conditional cdc33 ts alleles and cultured at a restrictive temperature (37\u00b0C), which completed the initiated cell division and ceased growth (Fig. 6B ). The activity of the TPI promoter used to produce K1 toxin from the pYX212::M1 plasmid declines at the end of exponential growth (108), and this phenomenon is even more profound in the version of the TPI promoter used in the pYX212 plasmid (unpublished data). The growth of the CWO4 CDC33, \u03c1 0 [pYX212::M1] strain is slightly faster at 37\u00b0C than at 24\u00b0C, causing the cells to reach early stationary phase in 8 hours (instead of 12 at 24\u00b0C); this difference explains why K1 toxin production in the CDC33 wild-type strain ceases in samples grown for 12 hours at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 6B ).",

The poly(A) tails, a common mark of most eukaryotic mRNAs (114). In addition, PABP1 serves as a specific regulatory protein and has an important role in mRNA stability and turnover. The importance of PABP1 in cellular translation and other vital processes is underlined by growing evidence that it is targeted by a wide range of viruses aiming to take over host protein synthesis or to escape the cellular antiviral defense (115-118).",

Because no experimental data describing PAB1 deletion in the yeast K. lactis were available, we followed a strategy used for the deletion of PAB1 in the yeast S. cerevisiae (119). Deletion of PAB1 gene is lethal in S. cerevisiae (94,120) but this lethality can be suppressed by the simultaneous deletion of the gene coding for Pab1p-binding protein (Pbp1) (119). We disrupted the PBP1 gene in the chromosomal DNA of the K. lactis IFO1267 strain using a loxP-G418-loxP system (121) and obtained the K. lactis IFO1267 pbp1::G418 strain. The G418 cassette was removed from the genome by an artificially produced Cre-recombinase, providing the strain K. lactis IFO1267 pbp1\u0394. We used the same strategy to introduce a PAB1 deletion and to obtain the required strain, K. lactis IFO1267 pbp1\u0394 pab1\u0394. Another protein that stabilizes some viral 5' poly(A) tracts and thus may also affect translation of the respective mRNAs is Lsm1 (39). We disrupted the LSM1 gene in the K. lactis IFO1267 genome using a strategy similar to that described for PBP1 deletion. The K. lactis pbp1\u0394 pab1\u0394 double-mutant strain is viable but exhibits a slow-growth phenotype, similar to the reported behavior in S. cerevisiae (119).",

Production of the pGKL1 killer toxin into culture medium was assayed by a well diffusion test on YPD agar plates with a lawn of the S. cerevisiae S6/1 sensitive strain. Culture medium was used either undiluted (1x) or diluted 10x and 100x with sterile YPD medium. This figure refers to Fig. 7 .",

Individual cDNA sequences corresponding to transcripts of a given ORF are aligned below the template DNA. After mRNA was isolated from K. lactis IFO1267, cDNA was prepared by SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (M-MuLV mutant; clone names begin with the number sign (#)) or by AMV Reverse Transcriptase (Finnzymes; clone names begin with the letter A; this enzyme was used only for K1ORF2, K1ORF3 and K2ORF5). In this comparison, we have also included clones obtained from the double-mutant strain K. lactis IFO1267 pbp1\u0394 pab1\u0394 (see text; clone names beginning with the letter P; this approach was used only for K1ORF2 and K1ORF3). The uniform distribution of the clones indicate that the reverse transcriptases and strains used for mRNA isolation/cDNA synthesis/clone preparation do not affect the results. The sequences of at least 20 independent clones were determined and aligned with the plasmid (template) DNA sequence of each ORF. Sequence sections that share sequence identity with the template plasmid DNA are labeled in red. Sequence sections that do not share sequence identity with the template plasmid DNA, thus containing non-template nucleotides of mRNA transcripts, are labeled in green. Guanosine residues that correspond to the original caps at the 5' ends of the mRNAs are underlined in black (G). All sequences are shown in the 5' to 3' transcription orientation regardless of their ORF's natural orientation in pGKL plasmids. (B) The 5' untranslated regions of the actin gene (KLLA0_D05357g) encoded by K. lactis IFO1267. (C) The 3' untranslated regions of K1ORF1, K2ORF5 and K2ORF10 encoded by pGKL plasmids. Template DNA with its stop codon (in the gray box) is shown for each ORF.

The PCR product was resolved by agarose electrophoresis, purified, and transformed into K. lactis IFO1267. The deletion of the PBP1 gene was verified by PCR. This modified strain was transformed with the pSH65 plasmid (Gueldener et al., 2002) , incubated for 5 hours in nonselective medium and plated on solid medium supplemented with phleomycin (400 \u00b5g/ml). Monocolonies were grown on YPD plates with phleomycin for two days and subsequently tested for their ability to grow on G418 (250 \u00b5g/ml) selective plates. The excision of the G418 cassette was verified by PCR for selected colonies that did not grow in the presence of G418.

Readers are referred to references by Kast et al. and Meineke et al. for more information concerning action of the K. lactis toxin and related ribotoxins (31,33). The translation of eukaryotic mRNAs is almost exclusively initiated by the binding of translation initiation factors to the 5' cap structure. Conventional m 7 G mRNA cap formation requires three principal enzymatically catalyzed steps. During the first step, pyrophosphate is removed from the triphosphate end of the messenger RNA by TPase, GTase then transfers GMP from a GTP molecule to the new diphosphate end, and a methyl moiety is finally transferred from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) by MTase to the N 7 position of the terminal guanosine. Conventional m 7 G-cap synthesis has been reviewed in (34,35). Whereas enzymatic activities required for canonical m 7 G-cap synthesis are highly conserved among eukaryotes and viruses, the organization of the capping apparatus itself is not conserved (36).",

The homologous integration of the mutational cassette (Fig. 2A) into the pGKL2 plasmid resulted in appearance of the new larger plasmid pRKL2 (Recombinant K. lactis plasmid pGKL2, 14353 bp) in the yeast cells. This plasmid contained mutated codons encoding alanines at the positions of three amino acids (D432, G438 and D440) conserved in a predicted K2Orf3p SAM-binding site and also included the G418 resistance gene under control of the K1ORF2 Upstream Control Region [UCR; a promoter in sensu lato and a sequence located between the AUG initiation codon and the UCS (including) of the selected ORF](Fig. 2C and 2D). Two smaller plasmids in the cells corresponded to the natural pGKL1 (8874 bp) and pGKL2 (13457 bp) plasmids(Fig. 2D, lane 2). Randomly selected K. lactis clones containing all three plasmids were passaged in a selective liquid medium containing G418 (250 \u00b5g/ml) for at least 60 generations and plated on agar medium supplemented with G418 (250 \u00b5g/ml). Purified plasmids from randomly selected subclones were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. In a few cases, the natural pGKL2 plasmid was lost, and only pGKL1 and recombinant pRKL2 plasmids remained in the yeast cells(Fig. 2D, lane 3). In most cases, both pGKL2 and pRKL2, containing the mutated MTase active site, replicated stably together in K. lactis cells passaged under selective pressure of G418 antibiotics for more than 400 generations(Fig.",

K1ORF4, K2ORF3 and K2ORF4 contain two putative UCS sites each. We evaluated the sequences of all these UCS sites and refined their previously reported consensus sequence, ATNTGA (83), by calculating the occurrences of all 4 nucleotides in the variable N position: A = 50%, G = 11%, C = 22%, and T = 17%. The TSS (+1 nucleotide) is usually located in a short window 17 to 22 nt downstream from the 3' end of the UCS; the median distance is 19 nt, and the extremes values are 13 and 25 nt. Transcription initiates at the adenosine nucleotide. Two exceptions were present in the minor transcripts of K2ORF2 and K2ORF4; they start with G and T, respectively. The minor upstream K2ORF4 UCS ends with a guanosine nucleotide (ATATGG), an exception to the consensus sequence, and serves as a non-canonical TSS, initiating with a T that is located only 13 nt downstream from the UCS and thus suggesting a slightly different mode of transcription initiation than in other UCRs. Most of the UTRs are very short regardless of the presence or absence of 5' non-template leaders. Exceptions to this rule are the K2ORF2 UTR (\u2248 60 nt), K2ORF3 long UTR (\u2248 150 nt), K2ORF3 short UTR (\u2248 60 nt) and K2ORF5 UTR (\u2248 90 nt)",

Our experiments, both in vitro (Fig. 5) and in vivo (Fig. 6), strongly suggest that these 5' terminal structures of the pGKL mRNAs support a novel manner of translation initiation independent of the active eIF4E protein. The active translation of 5' polyadenylated mRNAs, which do not bear 5' caps and 3' poly(A) tails, is further supported by our observation that these mRNAs are present in polysomes in both K. lactis IFO1267 naturally bearing pGKL plasmids and the engineered S. cerevisiae CWO4 \u03c1 0 [pGKL1/2] strains (data not shown). Pab1 and Lsm1 Deletions Support the Translation of pGKL mRNAs Poly(A) tracts within the 5' UTRs and the 5' poly(A) leaders of the eukaryotic and viral mRNAs have been identified as enhancers of mRNA translation in various examples (38,85,109,110) as well as translational repressors in other cases (111,112). Some studies even show that poly(A) stretches within 5' UTRs may serve as translational enhancers until they reach a certain threshold length. Further increases in the number of consecutive adenosine nucleotides beyond the threshold length lead to translational repression (113). Poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) plays an important role in many of these studies and biological examples. PABP1 is an abundant general translation initiation factor that binds to 3'",

Despite the many similarities between poxviruses and the apparatuses of pGKL transcription and RNA modification (22), the simplest explanation for increased pGKL toxin production in the lsm1\u0394 strain might be the stabilization of pGKL mRNAs in the cell due to prominent involvement of the Lsm1 protein in a cytoplasmic deadenylation-dependent mRNA decay pathway (reviewed in (125)). We calculated thelengths of the continuous 5' poly(A) leaders of the pGKL mRNAs while considering both non-template and template-coded adenosine nucleotides. While the maximal length of the 5' poly(A) leaders can reach 26 nucleotides, their average and median lengths are much lower. The median lengths of 5' poly(A) leaders in transcripts from only two genes, K1ORF3 and K2ORF7, are 12 adenosine nucleotides. Transcripts from K1ORF1, K1ORF2 and K2ORF11 have 5' poly(A) leaders with median lengths of 10 adenosine nucleotides. All other pGKL transcripts have shorter 5' poly(A) leaders (Tables S1A and S5). These results agree very well with the genome-wide study of Xia et al., who showed that the presence of poly(A) stretches in 5' UTRs in S. cerevisiae transcripts positively correlates with enhanced protein synthesis until the length of the 5' poly(A) regions reaches at least 12 consecutive adenosine nucleotides (113), which is also the optimal length for the binding site of yeast Pab1 (120). Pab1 might function as a negative regulator that can, due to the documented sharp increase in its binding affinity to poly(A) stretches ranging from 8 to 12 adenosine residues in length (120), further modulate the expression of pGKL genes. Such Pab1 activity was suggested for larger set of yeast genes and can be demonstrated in mRNA coding for cyclin PCL5, which contains the longest yeast 5' UTR poly(A) region and shows inefficient translation and extremely low ribosomal occupancy (113). In mammalian cells, PABP1 binds as a part of the negative autoregulatory complex to the adenosine-rich elements within the 5' UTR of its own mRNA ). mRNAs containing long uncapped poly(A) leaders (25 nt long) are efficiently translated in WGE lysates and, in contrast to other mRNAs, do not commonly decrease in translation rate at high mRNA concentrations (85). This behavior suggests a lower dependence of such mRNAs on translation factors. Indeed, mRNAs containing long 5' poly(A) leaders can efficiently enter translation, even in the absence of the otherwise essential translation factors eIF4F, eIF3 and PABP1 (109). Late poxviral mRNAs containing long 5' poly(A) leaders have a low requirement for eIF4F and might have a low requirement forPABP1 (113,126). Interestingly, pGKL1 mRNAs coding for toxin and immunity phenotypes contain a higher fraction of mRNAs with poly(A) leaders that are at least 12 residues long (Tables S1A and S5). These mRNAs, which perhaps normally have Pab1 bound to their 5' UTRs, may become unblocked and available for translation in the K. lactis pbp1\u0394 pab1\u0394 strain, thus increasing overall pGKL toxin production. The control strain, K. lactis pbp1\u0394, showed no growth defects and the lowest enhancement of pGKL toxin productionFig. 7A.Similarly to its human ortholog ataxin-2, yeast Pbp1 protein is involved in a wide range of cellular process; malfunction of ataxin-2 causes serious diseases in humans, including neurodegenerative spinocerebellar ataxia type II (127). Pbp1 (ataxin-2) functions are particularly associated with mRNA stability and translation, and Pbp1 is a negative regulator of a poly(A) nuclease (128), which might be a reason for the enhanced production of the pGKL toxin in the pbp1\u0394 strain. To exclude the possibility of changes in 5' poly(A) leader length and m 7 G capping of pGKL transcripts in the pbp1\u0394 pab1\u0394 double-mutant strain, we analyzed 5' ends from K1ORF2 and K1ORF3 mRNAs coding for the toxin \u03b1/\u03b2-subunit and immunity, respectively, by the 5' RACE. As clearly seen inFig. 7B, deletion of the PAB1 gene does not remarkably affect the structure of the 5' ends of the pGKL mRNAs.ConclusionsWe employed pGKL plasmids from the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis as a model to investigate and present here a complex view of the largely unknown transcriptome of yeast cytoplasmic linear plasmids. Although previous experiments reported the binding of pGKL mRNAs to an oligo(dT) column (18), we show that the pGKL transcripts are not polyadenylated at their 3' ends; however, they frequently contain uncapped 5' poly(A) leaders that are not complementary to the plasmid DNA. The degree of 5' capping and/or 5' polyadenylation is specific to each gene and is most likely controlled by short UCRs preceding the",

            "text": "methylated caps at their 5' ends. Translation of pGKL transcripts is independent of eIF4E and Pab1 translation factors. With regard to yeast (113) and mammalian (111,112) mRNAs containing long poly(A) stretches in their 5' UTRs, we suggest that Pab1 serves as a negative regulator of the pGKL mRNAs containing 5' poly(A) leaders. It is tempting to speculate that differences in the median lengths of the 5' mRNA poly(A) leaders of each gene (Tables S1A, S5) might reflect the degree of inhibition of the corresponding gene expression by Pab1, which might also be an evolutionary force driving the selection of the appropriate UCRs. We hypothesize that the small and extremely compact genome of pGKL plasmids uses different levels of 5' capping and 5' polyadenylation to finely tune the expression of each gene to proper levels to facilitate the formation of functional protein complexes and to keep pGKL gene expression in harmony with the host cell. Some initial evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from comparing our data with that of Schickel et al., as discussed earlier (84). We also provide data further supporting an evolutionary relationship between a group of the cytoplasmic yeast linear plasmids and poxviruses (22). This connection is fascinating because members of the Poxviridae family have been found only in vertebrates and arthropods, and some of them cause highly contagious and serious diseases of humans and animals. Parallel studies of yeast cytoplasmic linear plasmids and poxviruses may lead us to the origin of eukaryotic viruses. The pGKL plasmids could also help us better understand basic processes and host cell-virus interactions that are not easily studied in mammalian systems. Last but not least, K. lactis is one of the most important yeast for research and industrial biotechnology (129), and our results suggest that lsm1\u0394 strains can greatly improve the production of heterologous proteins from pGKL-based expression plasmids.

The vaccinia virus encodes its own heterodimeric capping enzyme, which is composed of D1 and D12 subunits. D1 contains the domains coding for all three principal enzymatic activities required for conventional m 7 G cap synthesis arranged in an identical order to that of the domains of K2Orf3p. The D12 subunit heterodimerizes with the MTase domain of the D1 subunit and allosterically stimulates its activity (47-52). However, the MTase activity of the D1 subunit of the vaccinia virus capping enzyme is detectable even in the absence of the stimulating protein (48). Does not Complement Conditional Mutations in CEG1 and ABD1 Genes Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains lacking active components of the mRNA capping machinery have been successfully used for studies of heterologous capping enzymes, including those from human (53,54), mouse (54), Candida albicans (55,56), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (54,57), Encephalitozoon cuniculi (58), Caenorhabditis elegans (59,60) and vaccinia virus (49,61). Putative capping enzyme K2Orf3p belongs to the D1-like group of capping enzymes due to its high similarity to the vaccinia virus capping enzyme. We therefore decided to test the ability of K2Orf3p to complement the growth of yeast cells bearing temperature-sensitive mutations in either the cap guanylyltransferase CEG1 (GTase,",
