The indicators of corporate performance under consideration are occupancy rate (OPR), return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), stock return, and the overall financial performance measured by a comprehensive score (a combined measure of asset management, profitability, short-term solvency or liquidity and long-term solvency based on factor analysis). The effects of changes in the state of economy (real GDP growth rate, DGDP) and tourism growth (growth rate of total foreign tourist arrivals, DTA) on the corporate performance of tourist hotels are then examined via panel regression tests. Test results show that both DGDP and DTA are significant explanatory factors of OPR, but only DTA can strongly explain ROA and ROE. However, neither DGDP nor DTA have a significant influence on hotel stock performance. Further, the economic factor \u00f0DGDP\u00de is slightly more crucial than the industry factor \u00f0DTA\u00de in describing the overall financial performance in the Taiwanese hotel industry. Empirical findings offer valuable information for government tourism policymakers and tourist hotel owners and managers.",

            "text": "The economy is the environment in which all firms operate (Bodie, Kane, & Marcus, 2008) . Thus, the prospects of a firm are closely tied to the state of the economy (or economic climate). In other words, changes in corporate performance are closely related to expansion and contraction of the business cycle. Bodie et al. (2008) argued that the economic climate might have a greater impact on profits than the firm's performance within its industry. The corporate performance in the hotel industry may also rely on economic conditions. The hotel industry is viewed as a cyclical industry, an industry that is highly sensitive to the state of the economy (Bodie et al., 2008) . The reason is that the hotel companies tend to have higher fixed costs (costs that all firms incur regardless of their production levels) than variable costs (costs that increase or decrease as the firm produces more or less). With high fixed costs, hotel companies are very sensitive to business conditions because in economic downturns, hotel firms cannot reduce costs as output falls in response to falling sales. Hotel profits will hence swing more widely with sales because costs do not move to offset revenue variability (i.e. small swings in business conditions can have profound effects on profitability of hotels). As Graham and Harris (1999) noted, due to their high fixed costs, hotels require maintaining high revenue to survive and generate adequate profit.",

On the one hand, the expansion of tourism industry or activities directly enhances the development of hotel industry by increasing the occupancy rate and hence sales revenue. On the other hand, tourism development can significantly improve business environment, which has an indirect effect on the corporate performance of hotel firms. Previous empirical studies have supported that tourism expansion can boost economic development (Balaguer & Cantavella-Jorda, 2002; Dritsakis, 2004; Fayissa, Nsiah, & Tadasse, 2008; Gunduz & Hatemi-J, 2005; Kim, Chen, & Jang, 2006; Lee & Chang, 2008; Proenca & Soukiazis, 2008) . Chen (2007b) showed that improved economic conditions caused by tourism expansion could raise corporate earnings and strengthen the financial performance of tourism-related firms.

Ross, Westerfield, and Jordan (2008) stated that return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) indicate the profitability of companies, which may fail to measure the company's overall performance. Moreover, although stock price has been widely used as an indicator for corporate performance (Chen, 2007b; Heiman, 1988) , it might be easily twisted by expectations of irrational investors about future corporate earnings. That is, if investors are not rational, investors' perceptions about market riskiness will be biased and a firm's stock price would not reflect the true financial performance.",

            "text": "Specifically, this study makes the following contributions to the tourism literature. First, various indicators of corporate performance are used to test the effects of economic condition and tourism growth on corporate performance in the tourist hotel industry. The indicators of corporate performance under consideration are occupancy rate, ROA, ROE, stock return, and a comprehensive score. The occupancy rate is a common performance measure of sales revenue in the hotel industry. As mentioned, ROA and ROE measure profitability of hotel companies, whereas stock price can evaluate hotel stock performance. In addition, we follow Boubakri, Cosset, Fischer, and Guedhami (2005) , Kesner (1987) , Liu and Hung (2006) and Otchere and Chan (2003) to use several accounting/financial ratios to calculate a comprehensive measure, or score, of corporate performance that can represent the overall financial performance of hotel companies. Six accounting ratios, including debt-equity ratio, total asset turnover, current ratio, quick ratio, ROA, and ROE, are used to calculate a comprehensive score based on factor analysis. The comprehensive score thus combines measures of asset management (total asset turnover), profitability (ROA and ROE), short-term solvency or liquidity (current ratio and quick ratio) and long-term solvency (debt-equity ratio). In consequence, this study enables us to evaluate the impact of economic condition and tourism expansion on the corporate performance of tourist hotels in terms of not only their sales revenue, profitability and stock performance but also the overall financial performance. Empirical findings can provide tourism policymakers and hotel business managers with some practical managerial implications.",

            "text": "Since the business success of hotel companies is assumed to be tightly related to the economy, it makes sense to analyze the influence of the state of the aggregate economy on corporate performance in the hotel industry. However, there is relatively little examination of the association between business conditions and corporate performance of hotel companies in the hospitality and tourism literature. Choi, Olsen, Kwansa, and Tse (1999) developed a model of the business cycle for the U.S. hotel industry. The hotel industry cycle is defined as the fluctuation in the total receipts of the entire hotel industry. The hotel industry cycle model demonstrated the growth of the hotel industry by showing that the hotel industry grew rapidly every four or five years during the 28 years from 1966 to 1993. The hotel industry cycle model could provide valuable guidelines for practitioners and researchers in the hotel industry. For instance, the average expansion period was about three years, while the average contraction period was about two years. Moreover, the hotel industry led general business cycle troughs (peaks) by an average of 0.5 (0.75) years. Choi (2003) employed an economic indicator system to project the growth and turning points of the US hotel industry. He identified 12 leading, 10 coincident and 10 lagging indicators in the study based on a comprehensive literature review as well as the National Bureau of Economic Research turning point criteria and statistical correlation method. As he noted, the performance of the economic indicator system illustrated the system's great potential as a forecasting method.",

Barrows and Naka (1994) investigated whether five selected economic variables (the expected inflation rate, money supply, domestic consumption, term structure of the interest rate, and industrial production) could determine the returns of U.S. hospitality stocks. They found that the expected inflation rate, growth rates of money supply and domestic consumption had a significant impact on hospitality stock returns. Chen et al. (2005) tested the impact of a set of economic variables and non-economic events on hotel stock returns in Taiwan. They observed that money supply growth rates and changes in unemployment rates are two influential economic factors of Taiwanese hotel stock returns. In addition, not only economic variables but also non-economic events, including wars, presidential elections, natural disasters, sports mega-events, and terrorist attacks, could have a strong effect on hotel stock returns. Similarly, a significant influence of economic and non-economic factors on hotel stock performance was found in China (Chen, 2007c) . Chen (2007a) studied the relationship between hotel stock returns and monetary conditions. By examining the performance of Taiwanese hotel stocks under two monetary policy environments, he showed that hotel stocks had a higher mean return and rewardto-risk ratio during expansive monetary periods. Chen (2007b) argued that a sound (poor) business environment should lead to a growth (decrease) in sales and earnings, and consequently strengthen (weaken) the performance of business firms. In other words, corporate earnings are expected to rise (fall) when the economy is expanding (contracting), resulting in strong (sluggish) business performance. Accordingly, he studied interactions between business conditions and stock performance of tourism companies in China and Taiwan. Gross domestic product (GDP) and stock price were used as proxies of business conditions and financial performance of tourism firms, respectively. Empirical results revealed a long-run link between business conditions and stock performance of tourism firms. Further, the improved business conditions could enhance the stock performance of tourism firms and financial success of tourism firms could improve business development. Tang and Jang (2009) examined the cointegration and causality between sales of four tourism-related industries (airlines, casinos, hotels, and restaurants) and economic growth in the U.S. Test results indicated no cointegration between GDP and sales of all four tourism industries, i.e. there was no long-run link between GDP and industry sales. However, GDP growth could lead to sales growth of all four industries and industry sales failed to cause GDP growth in the short run.",

            "text": "While the development of tourism industry is expected to have a directly beneficial impact on hotels, it can affect the hotel industry via its ability to enhance the state of economy, thus strengthening the corporate performance of hotels. Empirical studies supported that tourism expansion can improve economic condition (Balaguer & Cantavella-Jorda, 2002; Dritsakis, 2004; Gunduz & Hatemi-J, 2005; Kim et al., 2006) . Balaguer and Cantavella-Jorda (2002) proposed a tourism-led growth hypothesis that tourism expansion was a significant factor in the development of the Spanish economy. Empirical results based on cointegration and causality tests supported the hypothesis. Cointegration tests revealed a long-term relationship between tourism receipts and gross domestic product, and causality test results indicated that tourism expansion can cause economic development. Dritsakis (2004) examined whether tourism could serve as a long-term economic growth factor in Greece. Such a relationship between tourism receipts and GDP was detected. Moreover, there was a bi-directional causality between growth in gross domestic product and tourism receipts. In other words, growth in tourism receipts and GDP growth could promote each other. Gunduz and Hatemi-J (2005) stated that Turkey, like many developing countries, gave priority to tourism as a part of its economic growth strategy. They tested the tourism-led growth hypothesis by examining whether tourism expansion had contributed to Turkey's economic growth. Test results showed that tourism development could lead to economic growth and thus validated the applicability of the tourism-led growth hypothesis to Turkey. Kim et al. (2006) studied the causal relationship between tourism expansion (proxied by growth in the number of total foreign tourist arrivals) and economic growth (GDP growth) in Taiwan. The results based on cointegration and causality tests illustrated a long-run equilibrium link and a bi-directional causality between the two factors. In other words, an expanding economy could lead to the expansion of tourism while the increase in the number of foreign visitors to Taiwan could promote economic growth. Similarly, the spending of international tourists had a positive impact on the economic growth of African countries (Fayissa et al., 2008) and tourism contributed significantly to the improvement of the standard of living in four Southern European countries (Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain) (Proenca & Soukiazis, 2008) . Lee and Chang (2008) re-examined the long-run comovements and causal links between tourism development and economic growth for OECD and non-OECD countries (including those in Asia, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa) using a heterogeneous panel cointegration technique. They found a cointegrated relationship between GDP and tourism development on the global scale, after allowing for the heterogeneous country effect. In addition, tourism development exerted a greater effect on GDP in non-OECD countries than in OECD countries. In the long run, tourism development could cause economic growth in OECD countries and the two factors reinforced each other in non-OECD countries.",

The accounting ratios selected in the study need to meet two criteria. The accounting ratios have to have complete data from the second quarter of 1997 to the first quarter of 2008. Moreover, the selected accounting variables can represent six dimensions of corporate performance: capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risks (Persons, 1999; Thomson, 1991) . Accordingly, six accounting ratios are selected in the study: debt-equity ratio, total asset turnover, current ratio, return on assets, return on equity and quick ratio. The quarterly data of six financial ratios are also obtained from the TEJ database.",

Table 1 displays the correlation coefficient values among the five dependent variables and the exploratory variables over the entire sample period. As shown in Table 1 , OPR is significantly correlated with DGDP, whereas OPR, ROA and ROE are highly correlated with DTA. However, hotel stock return (SR) is not significantly correlated with either DGDP or DTA. The overall performance (SCORE) appeared to be strongly correlated with both DGDP and DTA. Moreover, high correlation between DGDP and DTA indicates that economic growth and tourism development are highly correlated. This is consistent with the empirical finding in Kim et al. (2006) .

OPR is a common performance measure of sales revenue in the hotel industry. ROA and ROE measure the profitability of hotel companies, whereas stock return can evaluate hotel stock performance. Based on factor analysis approach, six accounting ratios (total asset turnover, return on assets, return on equity, current ratio, quick ratio and debt-equity ratio) are used to compute a comprehensive score that can measure the overall financial performance rather than just sales revenue, profitability and stock performance. The comprehensive score combines measures of asset management (total asset turnover), profitability (ROA and ROE), short-term solvency or liquidity (current ratio and quick ratio) and long-term solvency (debt-equity ratio).

Compared to the economic factor, the industry factor explains more variation in occupancy rate. Changes in the state of economy can account for 45% of variation in occupancy rate, whereas tourism expansion describes even as high as 53% of variation in occupancy rate.

In specific, tourism expansion can account for more than 47% and 45% of variation in ROA and ROE of tourist hotels, respectively. While shifts in economic condition can strongly affect sales revenue of tourist hotels, they exhibits no substantial influence on the profitability. Stock performance of tourist hotels, however, is found to be not significantly linked to changes in both economic condition and inflow of foreign tourists. The insignificant impact of economic and tourism growth on hotel stock returns might be attributable to a time-varying discount rate caused by investors' changing perceptions about the riskiness of cash flows. Note that variations in stock prices, according to the basic stock valuation model, reflect changes in both expected cash flows and the discount factor (perceived riskiness of a stock's cash flows). While the booming economy and especially strong tourism expansion can impact hotel stock prices majorly through their influences on sales revenue of tourist hotels as illustrated above, investors' changing perceptions about the riskiness of cash flows can lead to changes in the discount rate (or the time-varying discount rate). Hence, the time-varying discount rate, caused by investors' changing perceptions about the riskiness of cash flows, can break the tie between hotel stock returns and the two factors, regardless of how good the state of economy and how successful tourism development can be in improving earnings performance.",

Thus the event had no significant effect on occupancy rate, profitability and performance. Second, the 921 earthquake was considered as a local crisis, one that did not seriously damage the foreign tourism market. This is supported by the statistics. The growth rate of foreign tourist arrivals was \u00c05.21% in the third quarter of 1999 (when the 921 earthquake struck), which is relatively small compared to \u00c09.87% and \u00c0129.05% for the corresponding quarter of the 911 terrorist attacks in the US and the SARS outbreak.

The poor profitability and the corporate performance of tourist hotels may be attributed to the following reasons. Net profit is equal to total revenues minus total cost.

Moreover, economic growth is highly correlated with tourism development. This supports the findings in Kim et al. (2006) , who found a long-term association between economic growth and tourism expansion and a bi-directional causality between tourism and economic growth in Taiwan. In other words, economic development and tourism growth can promote each other. Since both economic growth and tourism expansion can have a significant impact on the corporate performance of tourist hotels, it is appropriate for the Taiwanese government to use a long-term tourism strategic plan to develop the tourism market, thus stimulating the economy and corporate performance in the tourist hotel industry.",

One of his policies was to re-open direct flights between Taiwan and China, which had been banned since 1949. Taiwan and China signed the agreement to restore regular direct flights between the two regions on June 13, 2008 and direct flights resumed on July 4, 2008. Currently, up to 3000 Chinese tourists a day are allowed to visit Taiwan and the number may increase from 3000 to 7200 after May 2009. This phenomenon of tourism growth is expected to improve the Taiwanese economy and the corporate performance of local hotel companies. For example, it is estimated that 3000 Chinese visitors per day would bring at least 60 billion Taiwanese dollars (US $2.7 billion) a year for local restaurants, hotels, bus companies and tour agents and moreover, approximately 30,000 jobs could be created, reducing domestic unemployment rate by one percent (AsiaOne, 2008) .",

This implies that tourism authorities and hotel business managers need to be aware that the sales revenue and profitability in the tourist hotel industry would suffer during periods of instable or low demand for tourism. To solve this problem, tourism policymakers and hotel managers can use the practical findings in Jang and Chen (2008) as guidelines for diversification or risk management in the Taiwanese tourism market. They used the financial portfolio theory to show how Taiwan can obtain optimal foreign tourist market mixes by minimizing variability in foreign tourist arrivals.",

This suggests that a large proportion of the overall financial performance of tourist hotels is still unexplained and affected by other factors. Note that both economic condition and tourism growth are external factors for the hotel industry. The development of the local economy and tourism market may depend on the development of the global economy and local government policies and efforts. Hotel owners and managers, instead, could concentrate on some internal factors or issues, such as cost control, the service quality, managerial efficiency, production productivity and human resource management. Whether those internal factors can explain the overall financial performance of tourist hotels deserves further examination.",
