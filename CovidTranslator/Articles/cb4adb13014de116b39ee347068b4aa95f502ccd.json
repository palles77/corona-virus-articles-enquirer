The virus is now affecting more than 155 countries and territories worldwideand growing. According to a report on lessons learned from the COVID-19 outbreak in China, published in JAMA, 1716 of 44672 (3.8%) health care personnel were infected in China, and in Wuhan 63% (1080 of 1716) health care professionals were infected, 247 of these were critical including 5 health care professionals who died [1] . However, the situation continues to evolve. At the time of writing exact figures cannot be given and they change every day; we therefore advise visiting the resources at the end of this editorial for up to date statistics. What is important is not to become complacent in low risk regions where community infection have not occurred. COVID-19 has already caused more deaths than SARS and MERS combined due to its greater infectivity and pandemic spread. We all need to be vigilant.",

It has also been a source of information to many in places where information has been limited or complicated. Accurate information as it becomes available is vital in reducing the confusion caused by the fear-based rhetoric. Untangling fear-based rhetoric from the truth is something as midwives we do daily. As always, we need to respond with sensitivity and compassion and not get swept up by this disempowering rhetoric. Rather than fear, the focus on providing accurate, and factual information from reliable sources is paramount. Our focus needs to be on eliminating discrimination and the racial undertones that further isolate and increase risk for those most vulnerable. The fluid nature of this emergency is unprecedented in our time and requires us all to come together in solidarity.",

            "text": "Various educational meetings and conferences have been cancelled which is also leading to anxiety and probably, financial distress. As a result, some midwives who work alone or in small groups may feel isolated. For example, the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) have made the difficult decision to postpone the Congress until 2021 in order to comply with the public health recommendation to maintain social distancing. Now is a time for midwives to provide support (informational and emotional) for each other. Social media (e.g. WhatsApp, Twitter, blogs) has proved useful for this purpose, strengthening the midwifery community by sharing each other's experiences and timely access to accurate, reliable resources. It is important that midwives' voices are present in this discussion to reassure pregnant women. Due to social distancing and those colleagues working alone and/or in higher prevalence regions, virtual communication opportunities have a vital role in keeping the profession connected. Importantly, this distancing concerns 'physical' distancing and does not require us to socially isolate ourselves from each other. The International Day of the Midwife Virtual (VIDM) conference in May is one conference that does not need to be postponed and may prove to be an important connecting opportunity.",

Midwives have been and continue to meet unprecedented circumstances for which they may feel underprepared. Preparing midwives to work in risky situations and stem the spread of infection whilst meeting the needs of women is an ongoing balance of priorities. Some midwives may even feel they are working outside their regional scope of practice. The Ebola outbreak highlighted how practice can be affected. For example, midwives working in Sierra Leone during the Ebola outbreak feared becoming infected, which affected their professional and personal lives [2] . In the study, motivation and support impacted the ability of the midwives to cope in these challenging circumstances. Midwives sense of duty obligated them to step into risky situations in a time of crisis. Likewise, similar scenarios are playing out with the COVID-19 pandemic in China, Iran and Italy. The Erland study highlighted the need for competency, creativity and courage when faced with challenges and ethical dilemmas.",

What is important is that midwives engage with colleagues, the community, primary health care and health promotion activities. This is not limited to education and practices such as hand hygiene and physical distancing, but also embrace working across professional boundaries and collaborating with other disciples. Midwives need to learn from previous experiences with SARS, Ebola and H1N1 that foregrounded how professional silo thinking is unhelpful. COVID-19 calls for a coming together, a blurring of traditional professional boundaries in ways that promote greater coordinated cooperation between all stakeholders. Irrefutably midwives have the skills and experiences to do this in exemplary ways.",
