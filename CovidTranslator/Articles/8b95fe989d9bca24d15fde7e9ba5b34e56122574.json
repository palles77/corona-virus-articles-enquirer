To understand how zinc mesoporphyrin (ZnMP) induces the expression of HO-1, we investigated the effects of ZnMP on Bach1 mRNA and protein levels in human hepatoma Huh-7 cells by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blots. We found that ZnMP markedly up-regulated HO-1 mRNA and protein levels, and rapidly and significantly decreased Bach1 protein levels by increasing degradation of Bach1 protein [half life (t 1/2 ) from 19 h to 45 min], whereas ZnMP did not influence Bach1 mRNA levels. The proteasome inhibitors, epoxomicin and MG132, significantly inhibited degradation of Bach1 by ZnMP in a dose-dependent fashion, indicating the degradation of Bach1 by ZnMP is proteasome dependent. Purified Bach1 Cterminal fragment bound heme, but there was no evidence for binding of ZnMP to the heme-binding region of Bach1. In conclusion, ZnMP produces profound post-transcriptional down-regulation of Bach1 protein levels and transcriptional up-regulation of HO-1. Our results indicate that ZnMP upregulates HO-1 gene expression by markedly increasing Bach1 protein degradation in a proteasomedependent manner.",

            "text": "Bach1, a basic leucine zipper (bZip) mammalian transcriptional repressor, is a sensor and effector of heme [7, 8] . Bach1 forms antagonizing heterodimers with the Maf-related oncogene family. These heterodimers bind to Maf recognition elements (MAREs) and suppress expression of genes (e.g., HO-1 and NQO1) that respond to Maf-containing heterodimers and other positive transcriptional factors [8] [9] [10] . After binding heme, Bach1 loses its DNA binding activity, after which it is exported out of nuclei [11] . Recent work has established that heme and CoPP lead to the up-regulation of the HO-1 gene by influencing intranuclear levels and binding of Bach1 and small Maf proteins to key regulatory sites of the HO-1 promoter [5, 12] . These studies show that heme enters the nuclei, binds to CP-containing motifs of the C-terminal region of Bach1 (amino acids 417-739), and leads to the dissociation of Bach1 from a heterodimeric repressor complex with small Maf proteins [8] . A separate synergistic effect of MePns is to stabilize Nrf2, which then can bind to the small Maf proteins and enhance gene transcription [5, 13] .",

            "text": "It is well documented that zinc mesoporphyrin (ZnMP), an analogue of heme, is a competitive inhibitor of HO activity [14, 15] . In previous tudies, we have characterized the regulation of the HO-1 promoter activities and mRNA levels by MePns. Recently we found that ZnMP upregulates the HO-1 promoter activity in human hepatoma Huh-7 cells, but does not significantly influence HO-1 promoter activity or mRNA levels in chick hepatoma LMH and primary cultures of chick embryo liver cells [6] . Other recent studies from our laboratory have shown that ZnMP up-regulates HO-1 mRNA and protein levels in NIH 3T3 cells (unpublished). However, little is known about the mechanism by which this occurs. To understand how ZnMP induces the expression of HO-1, in the work reported here we investigated the effects of ZnMP on Bach1 mRNA and protein levels. We found that ZnMP markedly decreases Bach1 protein levels but does not influence its mRNA levels. In addition, we expressed and purified the recombinant C-terminal heme binding region of Bach1, containing amino acids 417-739, named Bach1C, to investigate whether ZnMP is able to bind to Bach1. Binding assays showed that ZnMP does not bind to the heme-binding region of Bach1. Proteasome inhibitors, epoxomicin and MG132, significantly block the degradation of Bach1 by ZnMP. Our results indicate that ZnMP up-regulates human HO-1 gene expression by inducing Bach1 protein degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner.",

Only Bach1C exposed to heme showed a Soret band and a red shift of the maximum wavelength from 410 nm to 415 nm (Fig. 7B) . Because the Bach1C that was overexpressed contained a 6-His tag to facilitate its purification on Ni-NTA columns, we were concerned that heme or ZnMP binding to the purified Bach1C might be due to the six histidine residues, rather than the CP heme binding motifs. Therefore, we tested whether 6-His tagged-DHFR that was similarly overexpressed and purified would show ZnMP binding. It did not, either by visual or spectrophotometric examination (data not shown). In addition, we cleaved the 6-His tag from some preparations of Bach1C, using SUMO protease and the methods of Zuo et al [24] . The preparations of Bach1C thus produced showed the same binding characteristics and spectra as those of 6-His tagged Bach1C (data not shown), further indicating that the 6-histidine residues were not involved in the binding. These findings demonstrated that ZnMP, unlike heme, does not bind to Bach1C.",

Upon exposure to heme, heme binds to Bach1 and forms antagonizing heterodimers with the Maf-related oncogene family. These heterodimers bind to MAREs, also known as anti-oxidant responsive elements (AREs), and suppress expression of genes that respond to Maf-containing heterodimers and other positive transcriptional factors. After binding heme, Bach1 loses its DNA binding activity and then it is exported out of nuclei by triggering a Crm1-dependent mechanism.",

Earlier studies reported that zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) is a strong up-regulator of HO-1 transcription in liver cell cultures, in comparison to zinc bis glycol porphyrin (ZnBG), which showed minimal effects [26, 27] . In our studies, ZnMP up-regulated the HO-1 gene expression at both mRNA and protein levels in human hepatoma Huh-7 cells. ZnMP produced a profound and rapid degradation of Bach1 in human hepatoma Huh-7 cells, and also in human stellate LX-2 and NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown), suggesting that ZnMP-dependent degradation of Bach1 exists in many types of cells. Bach1 degradation by SnMP and heme have recently been reported [19, 28] . We performed studies comparing effects of SnMP and ZnMP (10 \u00b5M) in Huh-7 cells for various times (0-24 h). The degradation of Bach1 by ZnMP was both faster and more profound than that produced by SnMP (Fig. 4) .",

            "text": "So far, two distinct systems for protein degradation have been found in mammals: the lysosome system and the ubiquitin-proteasome system [29] [30] [31] [32] . In the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, substrates are first marked for degradation by covalent linkage to multiple molecules of ubiquitin and then are hydrolyzed by the 26 S proteasome, a 2000 kDa ATP-dependent proteolytic complex [31, 32] . Since 1994, pharmacological inhibitors of the proteasome have become available. Several types of proteasome inhibitors have been identified that can readily enter cells and selectively inhibit this degradation pathway. The most widely used are hydrophobic peptide aldehydes, such as carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal (MG132), carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norvalinal (MG115), and N-acetyl-leucinyl-leucinylnorleucinal (MG101), which reversibly inhibit the proteasome dependent degradation of proteins. These agents are substrate analogues and potent transition-state inhibitors, primarily of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome [20, 33] . MG132 (50 \u00b5M) can block the rapid breakdown of ubiquitin-proline-\u03b2-galactosidase (UB-P-\u03b2-gal) by the ubiquitin pathway in 30 min without affecting protein synthesis [20] . One of the critical functions of this pathway is the rapid degradation of highly abnormal proteins or critical regulatory proteins, such as cyclins, p53, and I\u03baB, that must be rapidly eliminated for control of growth and metabolism [32] . Epoxomicin, a natural product isolated from Actinomyces sp., is a cell-permeable, potent, selective and irreversible proteasome inhibitor. In the present study, epoxomicin and MG132 were used to investigate the mechanism by which ZnMP degrades Bach1 protein. Both epoxomicin and MG132 significantly blocked the ZnMP-dependent degradation of Bach1 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that down-regulation of Bach1 protein in the nucleus by proteosomal degradation is a highly likely mechanism. Further studies on how ZnMP is able to trigger proteasome-dependent degradation of Bach1 are underway in our laboratory.",

CP motifs have been found in several heme regulatory motifs (HRMs) and play an important role in heme binding in various proteins. Native mouse Bach1 contains a total of six CP motifs. Two CP motifs are downstream of the BTB (Bric-a-brac/Tramtrack/Broad complex) domain (CP1 and CP2), three CP motifs are upstream of the bZip domain (CP3, CP4 and CP5) and one CP motif is downstream of the bZip domain (CP6).

Problems in their clinical application have included concerns about the carcinogenicity of chromium [40] , the photosensitivity caused by tin porphyrins [37, 39, 41] , and evidence of possible bone marrow toxicity due to zinc porphyrins [42, 43] . In addition, levels of HO-1 protein have been found to be increased in mammalian, although not avian, cells exposed to tin and zinc porphyrins [6, 44] . The findings of the present paper suggest that some or all of the up-regulation of HO-1 protein levels produced by tin or zinc porphyrins is due to their abilities to degrade Bach1, thereby lifting the tonic repression that Bach1 exerts on HO-1 gene expression [5, 8, [11] [12] [13] . The greater degree of inhibition of red cell development by zinc vs tin porphyrins previously described [42, 43] may similarly be related to the more rapid and dramatic effect of zinc vs tin porphyrins on Bach1 degradation.",

The effect of ZnMP is particularly rapid and dramatic. Our present results further suggest that the Bach1 protein is broken down by the proteasome, but that the rapid and dramatic effect of ZnMP is not dependent upon binding to Bach1. Further studies are underway in our laboratory, designed to elucidate how ZnMP acts on Bach1 and the proteasome, as well as to search for other potential protein targets of these effects of ZnMP.",

(A) E. coli M15 with Bach1C and DHFR expression. 1: DHFR as control did not bind to endogenous heme from the E. coli and no color was seen; 2: Bach1C bound to endogenous heme which had brownish color. Recombinant Bach1C, produced in E. coli as described in Fig.7 , was purified by affinity chromatography. The resin with bound Bach1C was suspended in TBS, 0.1%Tween-20, pH 8.0 and incubated 1 h with 20 \u00b5M heme, ZnMP, or DMSO (Control), followed by washing the column with 8 mL TBS-T.
