Current predictions estimate that, during a pandemic wave, 12-30% of the population will develop clinical influenza (compared with 5-15% for seasonal influenza) with 4% of those patients requiring hospital admissions and one in five requiring critical care. This review covers the background, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment. The role of immunization and antiviral drugs is discussed. Experience from the first wave of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza suggests that a number of infected patients become critically ill and require intensive care admission. These patients rapidly develop severe progressive respiratory failure which is often associated with failure of other organs, or marked worsening of underlying airways disease. The critical care management of these patients and the implications for resources is reviewed. Guidance from a range of bodies has been produced in a relatively short period of time in response to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza. Disease severity has the potential to change, especially if there is virus mutation. Clinicians must be prepared for the unexpected and continue to share their experiences to maximize patient outcomes.",

In comparison with the seasonal influenza outbreaks seen every winter, influenza pandemics usually occur every few decades. The 1918 pandemic was estimated to have killed more than 40 million people in less than 1 yr. In late March and early April 2009, an outbreak of H1N1 influenza A virus infection was detected in Mexico, with subsequent cases observed in many other countries, including the USA. 11 89 The clinical picture in severe cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 is markedly different from the disease pattern seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza, in that many of those affected are previously healthy young people. On June 11, 2009 , the World Health Organization (WHO) raised its pandemic alert level to the highest level, phase 6, indicating widespread community transmission on at least two continents. 95 Recent data from numerous outbreak sites indicate that the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus is currently the dominant influenza strain in most parts of the world. 92 By October 2009, 191 countries and territories had reported more than 375 000 laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 with more than 4500 deaths. 88 As of October 29, 2009 , there had been 137 deaths related to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in the UK since June 2009. 55 In response to WHO raising the pandemic alert level to phase 6, priorities shifted from containment and treatment to mitigation in order to minimize viral spread by using populationbased measures. 88 In order to achieve this and avoid subsequent morbidity and mortality, effective preventative measures are needed by individuals, communities, and health-care workers (HCWs).",

A combination of triage, patient cohorting, adherence to infection control policies, and effective use of personal protective equipment (PPE), will also help reduce mortality and morbidity at different stages of the infection. Advice for the public includes guidelines issued by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) for the management of H1N1 in the health-care setting, schools, and business facilities. 43 44 Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus Influenza A viruses are classified according to the structure of its two surface antigens: haemagglutinin and neuraminidase. There are 16 H (haemagglutinin) and nine N (neuraminidase) types of antigens. H1N1 viruses are the most common, although H3N2 viruses have also been reported. Pigs, which can be infected by both avian and human strains, are considered 'mixing vessels' for the creation of novel strains of reassortant influenza A viruses. 4 The pandemic (H1N1) influenza A virus is a novel reassortant virus comprising two swine strains, one human strain, and one avian strain of influenza. Influenza A viruses undergo minor changes known as antigenic drifts (which are associated with localized outbreaks), and major reassortment changes known as antigenic shifts. Antigenic shifts are associated with influenza A epidemics and pandemics.",

Ideal specimens are nasopharyngeal swabs or nasal aspirate. Oropharyngeal and nasal swabs are also satisfactory if other samples are unavailable. For intubated patients, endotracheal aspirate should also be collected. Other acceptable specimens are sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage. 9 The time from illness onset to specimen collection, the site and quality of the specimen swab, and the time elapsed between specimen collection and testing can all contribute to a lower sensitivity for tests to detect pandemic (H1N1) virus infection. Recent evidence supports viral replication and retrieval of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus from lower respiratory tract samples (tracheal and bronchial aspirates) in patients with lower respiratory tract symptoms. These samples have higher diagnostic yields than samples from the upper respiratory tract. 83 Rapid antigen tests in an Australian subgroup of 21 patients with severe (H1N1) 2009 infection (requiring mechanical ventilation) were noted to have had poor sensitivity to the virus. 36 74 Rapid antigen tests performed on nasal and throat swabs tested positive in only 25% of these patients. Similarly, influenza type-specific immunofluorescent antigen assays performed on bronchoscopic specimens were positive in only 25% of the patients. However, RT -PCR testing performed on specimens from both the upper and the lower respiratory tracts for all patients tested positive for the virus in 81% and 100% of patients, respectively. 36 This highlights the need for careful interpretation of diagnostic testing for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection. The type of assay used and the origins of the sample tested may affect the accuracy of the diagnostic testing. 3",

These rates should be improved because seasonal influenza vaccination not only provides protection against the predominant circulating influenza strain, but also reduces the risk of an HCW being co-infected with different influenza strains, potentially causing genetic reassortment which could lead to the emergence of a new more virulent strain. 40 Some pandemic vaccines contain an adjuvant to reduce the amount of virus antigen to be used.

They should be cared for in a single room with barrier nursing (gloves, plastic aprons, surgical face masks, attention to hand washing and hygiene, etc.). At delivery, the use of surgical masks and eye protection in addition to plastic aprons is recommended as there is splash risk with Caesarean sections and instrumental deliveries. However, the use of Entonox is not considered an aerosolgenerating procedure. 24 If the numbers of admissions with H1N1 infection were to overwhelm the availability of single rooms, infected patients would need to be cohorted. If a parturient due to have an elective Caesarean section or induction of labour reports flu-like symptoms, then unless there is a pressing obstetric reason to proceed with induction or Caesarean section, balanced consideration should be given to delaying the procedure for 5 days. This would give the woman time to recover from her acute illness and will help reduce the risk to staff and other women in the hospital from contracting the virus. 65 Post-natally, breastfeeding should be encouraged. Infants who are not breastfed may be more susceptible to viral infection. Occasionally, it may be necessary to care for mother and baby separately (e.g. if the baby needs admission to the special care baby unit or if the mother has an active infection and fever). 14 Pandemic (H1N1) 2009: pregnancy and intensive care Pregnant women are over-represented in the group of patients admitted to hospital requiring intensive care. Observations from the USA, 47 Canada, 50 and Australasia 74 showed that pregnant women formed between 7% and 9% of admissions to ICUs.",

            "text": "The most common presenting symptoms of patients admitted to intensive care with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 include fever in 97%, cough in 93%, shortness of breath in 87%, fatigue in 46%, vomiting in 25%, and diarrhoea in 24%. 47 Symptoms and signs that have been associated with more severe disease include dyspnoea, fever for .3 days, abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, hypotension, bloody sputum, and altered mental state. 12 The three studies from Mexico, Canada, and the Southern Hemisphere describe patients requiring critical care presenting with rapidly progressing respiratory failure and refractory hypoxia. The time from hospital admission to ICU admission was short with a median of 1 day. 31 50 74 H1N1 2009 intensive care: respiratory management Guidance from the HPA, the RCOA, and the ICS is in line with published international reports. They point out that many of those admitted to intensive care have rapidly progressing, profound respiratory failure. Their data suggest that viral pneumonitis has the most common cause seen in the UK patients and haemorrhagic pneumonitis in Northern America. 62 In addition to direct viral pneumonia, pneumonia caused by co-infection with bacteria can also contribute to a severe, rapidly progressive illness. Bacteria frequently reported include Streptococcus and S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains in some cases. These bacterial co-infections are more frequent than initially recognized. Clinicians therefore need to also consider empirical antimicrobial therapy for community-acquired pneumonia. 82 The ANZAC study reported 48.8% of those admitted to ICU had ARDS or viral pneumonitis and 20.3% bacterial pneumonia. 74 Early mechanical intubation is recommended, and there is some suggestion that using noninvasive ventilation (NIV) as an interim measure may worsen outcome. 62 Hypoxia may be seen in two settings: patients may have compliant lungs, with the use of high PEEP and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) causing alveolar over distension, worsening oxygenation, and haemodynamic compromise. Other patients have poor lung compliance, and high PEEP and airway pressure release ventilation and HFOV may help. 62 Much of the data describe a resistant hypoxia with rescue therapies frequently being used. The use of neuromuscular block, inhaled nitric oxide, and prone positioning has been described with uncertain outcome benefits. 80 HFOV has been useful in refractory hypoxia, although the standard HFOV circuits without a viral filter may be an infection hazard. 62 ",

The number of critical care beds required in a pandemic has been estimated using several models. The assumption is that peak demand for critical care beds will significantly exceed capacity. 32 There is a risk that an increase in the virulence of the virus will mean a huge increase in demand for critical care. 33 DOH guidance clearly acknowledges that previous emergency planning advice to achieve a 100% increase beyond normal critical care bed capacity is not likely to meet demand. 37 It is estimated that at the peak of the pandemic, the requirement for mechanical ventilation may exceed available beds 10-fold. 25 When resources are limited, it is ethically reasonable to aim for the maximum benefit for the most people. 2 Applying this principle, critical care services should be used preferentially for patients most likely to benefit. Despite understanding the necessity for triage criteria when resources are scarce to allocate access to critical care, HCWs find the idea morally challenging and legally ambiguous. Withdrawing care from an established critical care patient with uncertain outcome for the benefit of other individuals, so-called 'reverse triage' is particularly testing.

            "text": "Critical care professionals routinely have to assess very sick patients and decide on withholding critical care admission or treatments and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments, where it is in the patient's best interest. When faced with intense demand, basic assessment tools to aid this process in a fair manner could offer assistance and reassurance to both professionals and the public. Inclusion criteria for potential survivors should facilitate appropriate and rapid referral. Similarly, exclusion criteria which identify patients unlikely to gain benefit from critical care treatment would assist delivery of appropriate treatment in primary and secondary care settings. Deciding which patients should be in inclusion or exclusion categories should be based on objective evidence to prevent arbitrary admissions and prolonged treatment of patients unlikely to survive. 51 However, there are no universally agreed procedures to triage and prioritize admission to critical care. The UK pandemic flu surge plan uses a staged triage scheme. 73 This is based on the Canadian expert panel's plan to triage admissions into and out of critical care units. Their plan uses the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score; 79 combined with a list of inclusion and exclusion criteria for admission to the critical care unit as a triage tool to augment clinical judgement. 15 The scoring is simple, easily reproducible, and based on physiological parameters. It has been validated in a number of different critical illnesses and has good correlation with predicted and observed outcome. 5 38 78 The use of a protocol like this may improve appropriate use of resources and help modify the stress of ad hoc clinical resource allocation. The protocol inclusion criteria are based on the need for single organ support (most benefit for respiratory failure) or a SOFA score of 7 or above. The exclusion criteria include a SOFA score of 11 or above ( predicted mortality 90%) and severe or advanced disease states that usually preclude admission to an ICU. 68 69 72 The appropriateness of critical care referral is judged on the initial SOFA score. On occasions when the score and clinical assessment appear conflicting, additional review by an experienced clinician is recommended. The minimum requirement for survival requires reassessment of SOFA scores at 48 and 120 h to determine response to treatment.",
