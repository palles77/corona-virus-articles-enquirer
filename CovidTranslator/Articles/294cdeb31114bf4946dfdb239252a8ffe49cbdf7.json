The Chinese government has adopted extreme measures to mitigate outbreak. 24 On 23 January 2020, the local government of Wuhan suspended all public traffics within the city, and 25 closed all inbound and outbound transportation. Other cities in Hubei province announced similar 26 traffic control measures following Wuhan shortly, see Figure 1 . The resumption date in Wuhan remains 27 unclear as of the submission date of this study on 25 February 2020. 28 The public panic in face of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak reminds us the history of the 1918 29 influenza pandemic in London, United Kingdom. Furthermore, its characteristics of mild symptoms 30 in most cases and short serial interval (i.e., 4-5 days) [4, 5] are similar to pandemic influenza, rather 31 than other two coronaviruses (i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). In 1918, a significant proportion of 32 the deaths were from pneumonia followed influenza infection. Thus, it might be reasonable to revisit 33 the modelling framework of 1918 influenza pandemic, and in particular, to capture the effects of the 34 individual reaction (to the risk of infection) and government action. In [6], we proposed a model 35 incorporating individual reaction, holiday effects as well as weather conditions (temperature in London, 36 United Kingdom) which successfully captured the multiple-wave feature in the influenza-associated 37 mortality in London.",

We note that the governmental action, in both 1918 and current time, summarized all measures including holiday extension, city lock-down, hospitalisation and quarantine of patients. We 42 presume it will last for the next few months for the moment, and will update later if things change. The 43 parameter values may be improved when more information is available. We argue that all prevention 44 and control measures may be categorised into two large groups, which are described by either a step 45 function or a response function, respectively. We also consider zoonotic transmission period of one 46 month and a huge emigration from Wuhan (35.7% of the population). Nevertheless, our model is a preliminary conceptual model, intending to lay a foundation for further modelling studies, but we can 48 easily tune our model so that the outcomes of our model are in line with the observation and previous 49 studies [3, 7] . cases (both reported and not reported). Let S, E, and I represent the susceptible, exposed and infec-55 tious populations and R represent the removed population (i.e., recovered or dead). In a recent study 56 [8], Wu and McGoogan found that 81% of cases were of mild symptom (without pneumonia or only 57 mild pneumonia), 14% were severe case with difficulty breathing, and 5% were critical with respiratory 58 failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure. 59 We adopt the transmission rate function from [6]. We rename the school term effect as the gov-60 ernmental action effect, since the former belongs to the latter. We also assume a period of zoonotic 61 transmission during December 2019. We model the zoonotic transmission (denoted as F ) as a stepwise 62 function, which takes zero after the shutdown of Huanan seafood market (presumably). We then only 63 model the sustained human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 after this date, along with the emi-64 model is formulated as follows:",

We 120 perform a simple sensitive analyses on \u03b1 and \u03ba in Figure 4 , where we can see that both \u03b1 and \u03ba are 121 needed to capture the observed pattern. In particular, when \u03b1 is around 0.9 and \u03ba is greater than 1100, 122 the simulated largely match the observed. q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q studies.",

Only 0.9% cases are from age 15 or less [11], while 74 In China, 0-14 years are 17.2%. To take this effect into account, we assume 10% of the population are 75 'protected'. Recently studies showed the serial interval of COVID-19 could be as short as 5 days [12, 13], 76 and the median incubation period could be as short as 3 days [11]. These characteristics imply short 77 latent period and infectious period. Thus, we adopt a relatively shorter mean latent period (3 days) and 78 mean infectious period (4 days).
