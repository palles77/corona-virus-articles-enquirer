Herein we demonstrated that cellular helicase DDX3 is involved in JEV replication. DDX3 knockdown inhibits JEV replication. The helicase activity of DDX3 is crucial for JEV replication. GST-pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that DDX3 could interact with JEV non-structural proteins 3 and 5. Co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy analysis confirmed that DDX3 interacts and colocalizes with these viral proteins and viral RNA during the infection. We determined that DDX3 binds to JEV 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 un-translated regions. We used a JEV-replicon system to demonstrate that DDX3 positively regulates viral RNA translation, which might affect viral RNA replication at the late stage of virus infection. Collectively, we identified that DDX3 is necessary for JEV infection, suggesting that DDX3 might be a novel target to design new antiviral agents against JEV or other flavivirus infections.",

            "text": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is one of the most common causes for epidemic viral encephalitis in humans and animals (Solomon, 2003; Tsai, 2000) . Its genome encodes a single polyprotein composed of three structural proteins [core, membrane (prM/M), and envelope (E)] and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). The mature viral proteins are produced via proteolytic processing of the single polyprotein by viral serine protease (NS2B-NS3) and cellular proteases Rice, 2001, 2003) . The viral replication is initiated by the replication complex through a process of RNA-dependent RNA polymerization in the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum membranes (Westaway et al., 2003) . Nonstructural proteins 3 and 5 are components of the replication complex, which associates with the 3\u2032 noncoding region of genomic RNA to initiate viral replication (Chen et al., 1997; Edward and Takegami, 1993) . NS5, the largest and most conserved viral protein, contains methyltransferase (MTase) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain. The MTase is involved in methylation of the 5\u2032-cap structure of genomic RNA, while RdRp is important for viral genome replication (Ackermann and Padmanabhan, 2001; Egloff et al., 2002; Guyatt et al., 2001; Koonin, 1993) . Until now there is no specific and effective treatment available for Japanese encephalitis virus infection; vaccination is the only effective control measure. Although vaccination is widely used, some public health concerns exist (Takahashi et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "Cellular DEAD-box helicases reside in both nucleus and cytoplasm (Chao et al., 2006; Yedavalli et al., 2004) ; they are involved in a variety of cellular processes related to RNA, such as splicing, mRNA export, transcriptional and translational regulation, RNA decay and ribosome biogenesis (Beckham et al., 2008; Choi and Lee, 2012; Garbelli et al., 2011; Rocak and Linder, 2004; Shih et al., 2007; Soulat et al., 2008) . DDX3(X), identified in 1997, is a member of the DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp)-box helicase family (Park et al., 1998) . It is ubiquitously expressed in a wide range of tissues (Kim et al., 2001) . DDX3 has orthologous candidates in many eukaryotic organisms from yeast and plants to animals; they share significant identities between each other . DDX3 is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein characterized by nine conserved motifs. It displays RNA-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent RNA helicase activities (Rocak and Linder, 2004; Schr\u00f6der, 2010) . Recently, DDX3 attracts great interest because several studies have shown that it is involved in the replication of several viruses that have major global health threats, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (Owsianka and Patel, 1999) , Hepatitis B Virus (Wang et al., 2009 ), Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Ariumi et al., 2007; Mamiya and Worman, 1999; Owsianka and Patel, 1999; You et al., 1999) and poxviruses (Kalverda et al., 2009) . The other cellular helicases such as DDX1, DDX5, DHX15, DDX28, DDX56 and DDX42 are the cofactors for the replication of HIV, coronavirus, hepatitis B virus, HCV, JEV and WNV (Ariumi et al., 2007; Fang et al., 2005 Fang et al., , 2004 Li et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2010 Xu et al., , 2011 Xu and Hobman, 2012) . Two recently published papers report that the novel DDX3 inhibitors possess the anti-HIV activity which highlights DDX3 as a novel target for the development of antiviral agents Radi et al., 2012) .",

Furthermore, we also demonstrated that DDX3 could interact with JEV NS3, NS5-MTase and NS5-RdRp proteins. Meanwhile, we found that DDX3 could bind to the JEV 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 un-translated regions (UTR) and colocalize with viral RNA during viral infection. Finally, we showed that DDX3 plays an important role in viral protein translation, which might affect the viral RNA replication at the late stage of viral infection.

BHK-21 cells were first transfected with DDX3 shRNA plasmid to decrease the endogenous DDX3 expression level. 24 h later, the cells were transfected with RNA interference-resistant plasmid (to exclude the influence of DDX3 shRNA plasmid) pCDNA3.1-DDX3r-HA, pCDNA3.1-DDX3r-K230E-HA or pCDNA3.1-DDX3r -S382L-HA before the cells were infected with JEV (MOI \u00bc0.01).

We synthesized Cmp6 to further confirm whether DDX3 helicase activity is critical for JEV infection. We infected BHK-21 cells with JEV virus (MOI \u00bc0.01) at 37 1C for 2 h before Cmp6 was added (0-50 \u03bcM). The plaque formation assay at 48 hpi showed that Cmp6 significantly inhibited JEV replication by 20-fold at the concentration of 50 \u03bcM (Fig. 4A ). The Q-PCR also confirmed the results (Fig. 4B) , and the results were consistent with the DDX3 helicase-dead mutants experiment. Meanwhile, we confirmed that Cmp6 did not stimulate significant cytotoxicity in BHK-21 cells at the concentration of 50 \u03bcM, while significant cytotoxicity was detected at the concentration of 100 or 200 \u03bcM by LDH assay (Fig. 4C) . Therefore, 0-50 \u03bcM of Cmp6 was used in our study. In summary, our results suggested that the helicase activity of DDX3 was necessary for JEV infection. The influence of DDX3 knockdown on virus assembly. The ratio of JEV RNA copy numbers between the supernatants and the cell lysates were detected by Q-PCR at 48 hpi.

The BHK-21 cells was infected with JEV (MOI\u00bc 0.01) after DDX3 silence, the ratio of the virus titers in supernatants and cell lysates were determined by plaque formation assay at 48 hpi.

The cells were harvested for dual luciferase assays at 3, 6, 9, 24, 48, and 72 h post transfection. The results showed that there were two peaks of replicon luciferase activity, which represented the first translation and the second replication peak.

However, the luciferase activities derived from a control reporter, Renilla luciferase flanked by cellular GAPDH 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs were not significantly changed (Fig. 7D ). In conclusion, all the data demonstrated that DDX3 could positively regulate JEV infection by promoting viral protein translation. Because DDX3 can bind to viral 3\u2032 UTR and viral NS3 and NS5 proteins, DDX3 might promote viral RNA replication.",

However, the virus resistance to these kinds of inhibitors has been a problem. One possible solution to overcome virus resistance mutations is to target host cellular factors . Theoretically, a drug targeting the cellular factors important for the viral life cycle can be used to inhibit the viral infection (Kwong et al., 2005) . Various host proteins are known to interact with DDX3, such as several translation initiation factors, transcription factor SP1, spliced mRNA in an exon junction complex, mRNP complex, nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling proteins (CRM1 and TAP) Lai et al., 2008; Schr\u00f6der, 2010; Yennamalli et al., 2009 ) and eIF4E (Shih et al., 2007) . Several viral proteins have also been reported to interact with DDX3, including hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase, hepatitis C virus core protein, vaccinia virus K7, HIV-1 and poxviruses proteins (Angus et al., 2010; Ariumi et al., 2007; Mamiya and Worman, 1999; Owsianka and Patel, 1999; Schr\u00f6der, 2010; Sun et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2009; Wang and Ryu, 2010) . Given that DDX3 is required for replication of HBV, HCV, HIV and poxviruses, it can be suggested that it is a promising target for drug development against these viruses that pose major global health threats Kwong et al., 2005) .",

The minus-strand RNA synthesis requires the presence of both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR (You et al., 2001) , and genomic RNA cyclization mediated by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032-UTR is essential for viral replication in all mosquito-borne flaviviruses (Fan et al., 2011; Ivanyi-Nagy and Darlix, 2012) . DDX3 also has been reported to be involved in translation initiation (Geissler et al., 2012) and DDX3 can promote HIV proteins translation by binding to viral 5\u2032 UTR. It is most likely that DDX3 destabilizes the RNA structure locally to form a region large enough to allow the recognition of the m 7 GTP cap or loading onto the 40S subunit to initiate protein translation (Soto-Rifo et al., 2012) . A recently published paper suggests that HCV 3\u2032 UTR retains ribosome complexes during translation termination to facilitate efficient initiation of subsequent rounds of translation (Bai et al., 2013) .

Since DDX3 could bind to JEV 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR and the helicase activity was necessary for JEV replication, we suspected that DDX3 might help the unwinding of the secondary structure viral RNA to enable viral RNA replication more efficiently; especially our GST-pulldown, GST-fused JEV, NS3, NS5-MTase or NS5-RdRp protein was first incubated with GST beads. After washing five times with PBS, the beads were incubated with His-tagged DDX3. The target proteins were detected by anti-His or anti-GST monoclonal antibody. (B) GST-fused DDX3 was incubated with GST beads first. The beads were then incubated with either His-tagged JEV NS3, NS5-MTase or NS5-RdRp protein after extensive washing with PBS. The target proteins were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-His or anti-GST monoclonal antibody. The GST protein was used as the control. (C) DDX3 interacted with JEV NS3, NS5 proteins during virus infection.

The coverslip was mounted onto the slide glass using PBS containing 50% glycerol. The cell nucleus was stained using 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma, China). For viral RNA staining, cells were first infected with JEV (MOI \u00bc0.01). 3 h later, the cells were treated with actinomycin D (Sigma, China) for 4 h (15 mg/ml) (Xu et al., 2010) to inhibit cellular RNA transcription before 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) was supplied. The viral RNA was detected using the Click-iT s RNA Imaging Kits (Invitrogen, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The coverslip was mounted onto the slide glass using PBS containing 50% glycerol. The cell nucleus were stained using 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma, China). Confocal images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 710 scanning confocal microscope.",
