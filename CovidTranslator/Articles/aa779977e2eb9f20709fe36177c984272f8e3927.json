A newly established branch of this field, ancient pathogen genomics, affords an in-depth view of microbial evolution by providing a molecular fossil record for a number of human-associated pathogens. Recent accomplishments include the confident identification of causative agents from past pandemics, the discovery of microbial lineages that are now extinct, the extrapolation of past emergence events on a chronological scale and the characterization of long-term evolutionary history of microorganisms that remain relevant to public health today. In this Review , we discuss methodological advancements, persistent challenges and novel revelations gained through the study of ancient pathogen genomes.",

Research on this topic aims to better understand the interactions between pathogens and their hosts on an evolutionary timescale, to uncover the origins of pathogens and to disentangle the genetic processes involved in their epidemic emer gence among human populations. Over the past 10,000 years, major transitions in human subsistence strategies, such as those that accompanied the Neolithic revolution 1 , likely exposed our species to a novel range of infectious agents 2 . Closer contact with domesticated animals would have increased the frequency of zoonotic transmission events, and higher human population densities would have enhanced the potential of pathogens to propagate within and between groups. Throughout human his tory, a number of epidemics and pandemics have been recorded or are hypothesized to have occurred (Fig. 1) . Although most of their causative agents still remain speculative, robust molecular methods coupled with archaeological and historical data can confidently demonstrate the involvement of certain pathogens in these episodes.",

Since the 1990s, the field of ancient DNA (aDNA) has brought molecular techniques to this study, providing a diachronic genetic perspective to infectious disease research. Initial attempts relied on PCR technology [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , which restricted the study of ancient microbial DNA to targeted, short genomic fragments that were amplified from ancient human remains. This method made infectious disease detection possible but gave limited information on the evolution ary history of the patho gen. In addition, complications associated with the study of aDNA, which is typically present at low quantities, is heavily fragmented and har bours chemical modifications [10] [11] [12] , hampered efforts to reproduce and authenticate early findings [13] [14] [15] .",

The retrieval of DNA from ancient human, animal or plant remains carries with it a number of challenges, namely, its limited preservation and hence low abundance, its highly fragmented and damaged state and the perva sive modern DNA contamination that necessitates a confident evaluation of its authenticity 21, 22 . Efficient aDNA recovery is best accomplished via sampling of the anatomical element that contains the highest quantity of DNA from the target organism. For human aDNA analysis, bone and teeth have been the preferred study material, given their abundance in the archaeological record. Recent studies suggest that the inner ear por tion of the petrous bone 23 and the cementum layer of teeth 24 have the greatest potential for successful human DNA retrieval. However, petrous bone sampling and shotgun NGS sequencing of aDNA from five Bronze Age skeletons previously shown to be carrying Y. pestis failed to detect the bacterium in this source material, suggesting that its preservation potential for pathogen DNA is low 25 .",

The diagram provides an overview of techniques used for pathogen DNA detection in ancient remains by distinguishing between laboratory and computational methods. In both cases, processing begins with the extraction of DNA from ancient specimens 183 . As part of the laboratory pipeline, direct screening of extracts can be performed by PCR (quantitative (qPCR) or conventional) against species-specific genes, as done previously 17, 61, 63, 64 . PCR techniques alone, however, can suffer from frequent false-positive results and should therefore always be coupled with further verification methods such as downstream genome enrichment and/or next-generation sequencing (NGS) in order to ensure ancient DNA (aDNA) authentication of putatively positive samples. Alternatively , construction of NGS libraries 184, 185 has enabled pathogen screening via fluorescence-based detection on microarrays 66 and via DNA enrichment approaches 17 . The latter has been achieved, through single locus in-solution capture 26, 28 or through simultaneous screening for multiple pathogens using microarray-based enrichment of species-specific loci 65 and enables post-NGS aDNA authentication. In addition, data produced by direct (shotgun) sequencing of NGS libraries before enrichment can also be used for pathogen screening using computational tools. After pre-processing, reads can be directly mapped against a target reference genome (in cases for which contextual information is suggestive of a causative organism) or against a multigenome reference composed of closely related species to achieve increased mapping specificity of ancient reads. Alternatively , ancient pathogen DNA can also be detected using metagenomic profiling methods, as presented elsewhere 41, 71, 72 , through taxonomic assignment of shotgun NGS reads. Both approaches allow for subsequent assessment of aDNA authenticity and can be followed by whole pathogen genome retrieval through targeted enrichment or direct sequencing of positive sample libraries. detection 66 , whereby probes are designed to represent unique or conserved regions from a range of pathogenic bacteria, parasites or viruses. Although amplification based or fluorescence based approaches can be fast and cost effective for screening large sample collections 17, 38 , enrichment based techniques are usually coupled with NGS and therefore provide data that can be used to assess aDNA authenticity.",

For example, a >97% sequence identity was shown between environ mental taxa and human associated pathogens such as M. tuberculosis and Y. pestis according to an analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA genes 73 . As such, given that envi ronmental DNA often dominates ancient remains that stem from burial contexts 74 , analyses should always ensure a qualitative assessment of assigned reads, that is, an evaluation of their mapping specificity and their genetic distance (also called edit distance) to the puta tively detected organism. In addition, one should con sider the known aDNA damage characteristics as criteria for data authenticity. Although several types of chemical damage can affect post mortem DNA survival, certain characteristics have been more extensively quantified. The first, termed depurination, is a hydrolytic mecha nism under which purine bases become excised from DNA strands. This process results in the formation of abasic sites and is a known contributor to the fragmen tation patterns observed in aDNA. As such, an increased base frequency of A and G compared with C and T immediately preceding the 5\u0374 ends of aDNA fragments is often considered a criterion for authenticity 12 . A sec ond type of damage commonly identified among aDNA data sets is the hydrolytic deamination of C, whereby a C base is converted into U (and detected as its DNA analogue, T) 12, 75 . This base modification usually occurs at single stranded DNA overhangs that are most acces sible to environmental insults, resulting in an increased frequency of miscoding lesions at the terminal ends of aDNA fragments 11, 12 . Consequently, the evaluation of DNA damage profiles (for instance, by using map Damage2.0 (reF. 76 )) is a prerequisite for authenticating ancient pathogen DNA and is necessary for ensuring aDNA data integrity in general. More detailed overviews of authentication criteria in ancient pathogen research have been reviewed elsewhere 19, 73 .",

Such approaches are highly valuable and, when combined, can be used to build an inter disciplinary picture of infectious disease history; however, limitations also exist. For example, the analysis of con temporary pathogen genetic diversity considers only a short time depth of available data and cannot predict evolutionary scenarios that derive from lineages that are now extinct. In addition, skeletal markers of specific infections in past populations only exist for a few con ditions and, when present, can rarely be considered as definitive, as numerous differential diagnoses can exist for a given skeletal pathology 97 .

Considered alongside the oldest palaeopatholog ical cases of leprosy dating to as early as the Copper and Bronze Age in Eurasia 106,107 and the high frequency of protective immune variants against the disease identi fied in modern day Europeans 108 , these results may sug gest a long history of M. leprae presence in this region. Moreover, the phylogenetic analysis of a 12th century S. enterica subsp. enterica genome from Europe showed its placement within the Paratyphi C lineage 109 . Further identification of the bacterium in 16th century colonial Mexico 41 revealed it as a previously unknown candidate pathogen that was likely introduced to the Americas through European contact. Given the low frequency of Paratyphi C today, these results may be indicative of a higher prevalence in past populations. Finally, an example from viral genomics is the recovery of HIV RNA from degraded serum specimens 57 , which high lighted the importance of archival collections in reconcil ing the expansion of recent pandemics. Specifically, these data were able to dispute a long standing hypothesis regarding the initiation of HIV spread in the USA.",

Subsequently , the genomes are assessed for their coverage depth and gene content for evaluation of their quality , which is also relevant for the comparative identification of virulence genes over their evolutionary time frames. Here, we show an example of virulence factor presence-or-absence analysis in the form of a heat map, as done previously 33, 34, 37, 41 . In addition, a comparison of the ancient genome or genomes with modern genomes can be carried out for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identification and for assessment of SNP effects (using SnpEff 186 ), which is particularly relevant for variants that seem to be unique to the ancient genome or genomes. Initial evolutionary inference can often be carried out through phylogenetic analysis and by testing for possible evidence of recombination in the analysed data set, for example, by comparing the support of different phylogenetic topologies 114 and by identifying potential recombination regions and homoplasies 110, 111 . If the data support clonal evolution, robust phylogenetic inference (for example, through a maximumlikelihood approach) is followed by assessment of the temporal signal in the data 124, 125 . If the data set shows a sufficient phylogenetic signal, molecular dating analysis and demographic modelling are considered possible, although the size of the data set will determine whether such analyses will be feasible and meaningful. Alternatively , if recombination is confirmed, genetic relationships between microbial clades or populations can be determined through phylogenetic network analysis 104 or through the use of population genetic methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and identification of ancestral admixture components 112, 113 .

In molecular phylogenies, the length of each individ ual branch usually reflects the number of substitutions acquired by an organism within a given period of time and, as such, varying branch lengths should represent heterochronous sequences. Therefore, an important pre requisite for a robust dating analysis is that the nucleo tide substitution rate of the species whose phylogeny is to be dated behaves in a 'clock like' manner, meaning that phylogenetic branch lengths correlate with archaeological dates or sampling times. Such relationships can be assessed through date randomization and root-to-tip regression tests (Fig. 3) . The former is used to assess the effect of arbi trary exchange of phylogenetic tip dates on the nucleo tide substitution rate and divergence date estimates 124 , whereas the latter is used for estimation of a correlation coefficient (r) and coefficient of determination (R 2 ) by relating the tip date of each taxon to its SNP distance from the tree root (using, for example, the program Temp Est 125 ). The resulting values determine whether there is a temporal signal in the data and suggest whether branches within a phylogeny evolve at a constant rate, in which case a strict molecular clock 126 can be statistically tested, for example, using MEGA 99 or marginal likelihood estimations 127, 128 , and applied. If branches are affected by differences in their evolutionary rates, a relaxed clock 129 would be more appropriate. In general, a constant mole cular clock will rarely reliably describe the history of a microbial species, even more so for infectious pathogens whose replication rates vary between active and latent or between epidemic and dormant phases 120, 130 . In certain cases, neither of the two models may fit the data, such as when extensive rate variation weakens the temporal signal. This challenge was encountered in initial attempts to date the Y. pestis phylogeny using too few ancient cali bration points 36, 130 . Similar limitations can arise when the evolutionary history of a microorganism is vastly affected by recombination, as observed for HBV 44, 53 , although HBV molecular dating was recently attempted using a different genomic data set and suggested that the currently explored diversity of Old and New World pri mate lineages (including all human genotypes) may have emerged within the last 20,000 years 43 .",

Although the two species are clearly distinguishable in terms of their vir ulence potential and transmission mechanisms, their nucleotide genomic identity reaches 97% among chromo somal protein coding genes 137 . In addition, they share the virulence plasmid pCD1, which encodes a type III secretion system common to three known pathogenic Yersinia: Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia enterocolitica. The distinct transmission mechanism and pathogenicity of Y. pestis are conferred by the unique acquisition of two plasmids, pPCP1, which contributes to the invasive potential of the bacterium 138 , and pMT1, which is involved in flea colonization 139, 140 , as well as by chromosomal gene pseudogenization or loss throughout its evolutionary history 141 .",

Its global distribution includes numerous rodent species 144, 145 and encompasses regions in eastern Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas (Fig. 4) , where the bacterium persists in active foci, some of which have existed for centuries or even millennia 31, 33, 34, 37, 130 .

The best yet characterized is the oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, although others are also known to play important roles in Y. pestis transmission 142, 144, 146 . Notably, recent modelling infer ences suggest important roles for ectoparasites such as body lice and human fleas in its propagation during human epidemics 147 .

This phenotype is determined by the unique acquisition and activity of certain genomic loci in Y. pestis, namely, the Yersinia murine toxin (ymt) gene, which is present on the pMT1 plasmid 140, 141 and facilitates colonization of the arthropod midgut 141 . In addition, it is dependent on the pseudogenization of certain genes, namely, the biofilm downregulators rcsA, PDE2 (also known as rtn), PDE3 (also known as y3389) 141 and the ure ase gene ureD 148, 149 , which are, by contrast, active in Y. pseudotuberculosis. The biofilm prevents a blood meal from entering the flea's digestive tract, leaving it starving; as a result, the insect intensifies its feeding behaviour and promotes bacterial transmission to un infected hosts [150] [151] [152] . This continuous transmission cycle among fleas and rodents, also called the enzootic phase of maintenance (Fig. 5) , is thought to drive the preser vation of plague foci around the world and is depen dent on environmental and climatic factors as well as on host population densities 142, [153] [154] [155] . Disruption of this equilibrium for reasons that are not well understood can cause disease eruption among susceptible rodent species, leading to so called plague epizootics 142 (Fig. 5) .",

Nevertheless, Y. pestis identification in human remains from Neolithic and Bronze Age Eurasia suggests that it caused human infections during these periods and originated more than 5,000 years ago 31, 33, 34 . These data have revealed important details about the early evolution of the bacterium. Genomic and phylogenetic analyses have shown that strains from the Late Neolithic and Bronze Age (LNBA) occupy a basal lineage in the Y. pestis phylogeny, and a recent study suggests the presence of even more basal variants in Neolithic Europe 31 (Fig. 6 ). Such analyses have demonstrated that, during its early evolution, the bacterium had not yet acquired impor tant virulence factors consistent with the complex trans mission cycle common to historical and extant strains. One of these genes is ymt, whose absence has been asso ciated with an inability for flea midgut colonization in Y. pestis 141 . In addition, these strains possess the active forms of the rcsA, PDE3, PDE2 and ureD genes, which suggests an impaired ability towards biofilm formation and blockage of the flea's proventriculus 141, 149 . Finally, they possess an active flagellin gene (flhD), which is pres ent as a pseudogene in all other Y. pestis, as it is a potent inducer of the innate immune response of the host 158 . As a result, during its initial evolutionary stages, Y. pestis may have been unable to efficiently transmit via a flea vector. Flea borne transmission of Y. pestis is a known prerequisite for bubonic plague development 141 ; hence, it has been suggested that this disease phenotype was not present during prehistoric times 33, 159 . In addition, these results have raised uncertainty regarding the pos sible vector and host mammalian species of the bacte rium. The Bronze Age in Eurasia was a period of intense human migrations, which shaped the genomic landscape of modern day Europe 85, 160 . Remarkably, the Y. pestis LNBA lineage was shown to mirror human movements during that time 34 and was found in regions that do not host wild reservoir populations today (Fig. 4) . The wide geographical distribution of these strains, their supposed limited bubonic disease potential and their relationship with human migration routes might together be indica tive of a different reservoir host species compared to wild rodents that have a central role in plague transmission in areas such as Central and East Asia, where the disease is endemic today.",

Although this transmission mechanism is currently not well understood, its comparative mode and efficiency in different rodent species have recently started to be assessed 162 evidence showing the full capacity for flea colonization similar to modern and historic strains was identified in two 3,800year old skeletons from the Samara region of modern day Russia 37 . Although this strain was shown to occupy a phylogenetic position among modern Y. pestis lineages (Fig. 6) , molecular dating analysis indicated that it originated ~4,000 years ago, suggesting that it over lapped temporally with the other Bronze Age strains that lacked the genetic prerequisites for arthropod transmis sion. Similar characteristics were previously identified in a low coverage 3,000year old isolate from modern day Armenia 33 , which suggests that multiple forms of the bacterium were circulating in Eurasia between 5,000 and 3,000 years ago that may have had different transmission cycles and produced different disease phenotypes. As the propagation mechanisms of those strains are still uncer tain, and the exact timing of flea adaptation in Y. pestis is unknown, additional metagenomic screening from human and animal remains may provide relevant infor mation on disease reservoirs and hosts across Neolithic and Bronze Age Eurasia.",

Two recent studies have reconstructed 6th century Y. pestis genomes from southern Germany 35,36 (Fig. 4) , a region that lacked historical documentation of the pandemic. Phylogenetic analysis showed that both genomes belong to a lineage that is today extinct and is closely related to strains from modern day China 35, 36 , which suggests the possibility of an East Asian origin of the first pandemic. This hypothesis was recently reinforced by the publication of a 2nd century to 3rd century Y. pestis genome from the Tian Shan mountains of modern day Kyrgyzstan 39 , which shares a common ancestor with the Justinianic plague lineage (Figs 4,6) . However, given the >300year age difference between these strains 35, 36, 39 , as well as the aforementioned East Asian sampling bias of modern Y. pestis data 130 , the geographical origin of the pandemic remains hypothet ical. Retrieval of additional Y. pestis strain diversity from that time period, particularly from areas known to have played an important role in the entry of this bacterium into Europe, that is, the eastern Mediterranean region, may hold clues about its putative source.",

Historical records suggest that the first outbreaks occurred in the Lower Volga region of Russia, and the disease then spread into southern Europe through the Crimean peninsula 96 . Initial analy sis of Y. pestis via PCR from victims of the Black Death revealed a distinct phylogenetic positioning of two mid tolate14th century strains and led to the proposal that the disease entered the continent through independent pulses 64 . By contrast, whole genome analysis of ancient strains from western, northern and southern Europe demonstrated a lack of Y. pestis diversity during the Black Death, which suggests its fast spread through the continent and favours a single wave entry model of the bacterium into Europe 20,30,38 , although the possible presence of additional strain diversity during that time has recently been explored 30 . Intriguingly, the phylo genetic positioning of the Black Death Y. pestis genomes places them on branch 1, only two nucleotide substitu tions away from the 'star like' diversification of branches 1-4 (Fig. 6) , which gave rise to most of the strain diversity identified around the world today 38, 130 .",

Inferred climatic data from tree ring records in central Asia and Europe have recently suggested that such epidem ics were likely caused by multiple introductions of the bacterium into Europe as a result of climate driven disruptions of pre existing Asian reservoirs 179 . By con trast, ancient genetic and genomic evidence supports the persistence of the disease in Europe for 400 years after the Black Death 32, 38, 62 . Analysis of Y. pestis strains spanning from the late 14th to the 18th century ce has revealed the formation of at least two European lin eages that were responsible for the ensuing medieval epidemics (Fig. 6 ). Both lineages derive from the Black Death Y. pestis strain identified in 14th century west ern, northern and southern Europe 30, 32, 38 , suggesting that they likely arose locally. The first lineage survives today and gave rise to modern branch 1 strains 30, 38 (which are associated with the third plague pandemic), suggesting the European Black Death as a source for modern day epidemics 38 . The second lineage has not been identified among present day diversity and currently encompasses strains from 16th century Germany 38 and 18th century France (Great Plague of Marseille, 1720-1722 ce) (Fig. 6) . These phylogenetic patterns are consistent with a con tinuous persistence of the bacterium in Europe dur ing the second plague pandemic. In addition, they are supported by analyses of historical records that suggest the existence of plague reservoirs in the continent until the 18th century ce 180 .",

The reasons for its disappearance are unknown, although numerous hypotheses have been put forward 181 , includ ing a change in domestic rodent populations in Europe, namely, the replacement of the black rat, Rattus rattus, by the brown rat, Rattus norvegicus 181 ; an acquired plague immunity among humans and/or rodents 181 (although this hypothesis requires an update to accommodate the recent identification of Y. pestis in Europe 5,000 years ago 31, 33, 34 and the involvement of the bacterium in the first plague pandemic 35, 36 ); the increased living standards such as the better nutrition and hygienic conditions at the beginning of the Early Modern Era, which may have contributed to improved overall health conditions in Europe and likely decreased the number of rats and ecto parasites in human environments 181, 182 ; and the poten tial disruption of the European wild rodent ecological niche owing to habitat loss and industrialization start ing in 1700 ce 180 .
