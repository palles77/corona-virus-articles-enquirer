We explore the consequences for travel inside a given region, in this case Mexico, particularly focusing on airplane transportation but attempting to give a gross approximation to terrestrial movement since this is the main form of population movement across geographical areas in the country; then we proceed to study the effect of behavioral changes required to lower transmission by lowering the contact rate and infection probability and lastly, we explore the consequences of disease spread in a population subject to social isolation.These models are not suitable for predictive purposes although some rough predictions can be extracted from them. They are presented as a tool that can serve to explore plausible scenarios of spread and impact, effectiveness and consequences of contention and mitigation policies. Given the early stage at which the epidemic is at the date of writing in Mexico, we hope these ideas can be helpful for the understanding of the importance of isolation, social distancing and screening of the general population.",

            "text": "At the end of December of 2019 a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, was detected in adults with pneumonia from the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. This new virus rapidly spread from Hubei Province to all China [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . By January 22th the virus was detected in South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand. Macao and USA. By March 12 of 2020, 128,343 cases of new virus have been detected in 116 countries and 63% of the cases has been register in Continental China. In February 26, Brazil was the first country of Latin America to detect this virus and Mexico detect his first case one day later [6] . CoVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, that has been widely studied in these recents weeks and we defer its description to the appropriate sources e.g. [4, 5] . The disease has been extensively modeled as a SEIR type of epidemic. In this work we use the SEIR model framework adapting it to the particular set of problems addressed here. In each section, dependent on the model variant used, we introduce the new parameters if any and refer to the appropriate section in the Appendix for the specific model equations. The rate \u03c9 or the related time 1/\u03c9 is the mean time of application of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI). All the recommendations that are being advised to prevent infection affect behavior (washing hands, keeping cough/sneeze etiquette, avoiding handshakes, keeping distance from other people) and, therefore, have a learning curve and can be forgotten or relaxed or incompletely adopted in any given population; also q is the proportion of the population that is effectively put under isolation. For example, in Wuhan, about 60% of the population was put under isolation. The total population normally living in that region is of about 14 million but the population at risk was obviously larger comprising much of the Hubei region.",

One of the first articles to calculate the basic reproduction number R 0 of the new coronavirus in Wuhan China, estimated (Jan 24, 2020) its value as 2.68(2.47 \u2212 2.86) with an epidemic doubling time of 6.4 days (5.8 \u2212 7.1) [3] . Other authors have estimated the basic reproductive number to be around 2.5, value that we use here for the Wuhan original outbreak but again there exist some variability and uncertainity in the different estimates [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . In what follows some simple models are described related to three specific situations described above and occurring during this epidemic: disease dispersion due to long range population movement, behavioral change imposed on individuals as an strategy of containment, and the effect of social distancing on the general fate of the epidemic.",

This model is an extension of the simple logistic growth model that has been recently used to predict cumulative COVID19 cases in China [15] . Parameters a, r and K must be estimated in order to properly describe the observed data and to provide accurate forecasts. We use an statistical approach through Bayesian inference. Details regarding the estimation procedure and the the results can be found on Appendix A. The growth rate r is close to 0.2 and it can range from 1.9 to 2.1 with a probability of 95%. However, the total size of the outbreak K is more difficult to estimate which is expected since Mexico is at the start of the outbreak and the current data shows that the contagion is accelerating. We estimate the final size of the outbreak to be 710,392 cases, ranging from 65,163 up to 1,258,296 with a probability of 95% provided no cotrol/contaiment/mitigation measures are applied. These are very long-term predictions and that is why there is too much variability in the interval. To estimate the parameters we used data up to March 24, 2020 . The last two available observations corresponding to March 25 and 26 can be seen in Figure 1 , and are closely predicted by the fitted model. Furthermore, we create 14 days predictions from March 25, 2020 to April 7, 2020 which can also be seen in Figure 1 . For example, at March 31, 2020, the model expects 1,103 cases, with a 95% probability interval of (401, 2353); and at April 7, 2020, a total of 4,202 cases are expected with a 95% probability interval of (1,440, 11,012). Table 1 shows the median posterior estimates for each parameter and 95% probability intervals. Figure 2 shows the marginal posterior distributions estimates for each parameter. Finaly, using the same data we estimated the basic reproduction number for the whole country.

In this section, we use data on the daily number of domestic and international travelers that arrive/leave to/from the Mexico City airport [16] . Below we follow the ideas presented first in [3] . We construct an standard SEIR Kermack-McKendrick mathematical model (see Appendix B) where s, e, y a , y s and r represent susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic infectious, symptomatic infectious, and recovered (immune) individuals. N is the total population. The force on infection is (\u03b2 a y a + \u03b2 s y s )/N . We consider that symptomatic individuals have restricted movement since either they are too sick to travel or are immediately detected by the health services at the airport or elsewhere. This consequently decreases their overall contact rate \u03b2 s compared to that of an asymptomatic individual \u03b2 a . Therefore \u03b2 s < \u03b2 a throughout this section. Following [3] we define two rates related to the inbound number of international air passengers to Mexico City (L im ), and the inbound number of national of both airplane and terrestrial passengers to Mexico City (L sm ).

We define \u03c1 t to be the proportion of international air passengers at time t who cannot transmit the disease, e.g., if \u03c1 t = 0.75 then 25% of the international air passengers are infectious. Of these carriers, a proportionq arrive as exposed not yet infectious individuals and 1 \u2212q arrive as asymptomatic infectious individuals. L ms and L sm are functions of time describing travelers either arriving to Mexico City airport of leaving Mexico City airport. These rates are time dependent since we eventually take into account the increase on the number of national travelers during holiday periods, specifically Holy Week in Mexico. For the analysis we perform a normalization in order to work with proportions and not absolute numbers of individuals (see (6) , Appendix C). One of the goals of this manuscript is to study the arrival of COVID19 to Mexico City and its plausible patterns of propagation. The timeline of our study is half a year. To estimate the daily average number of national and international inbound/outbound air and road travelers, respectively we employ information from the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) [16] and the General Directorate for Tourism Competitiveness of Mexico City [17] . The timeline is set to include Holy Week, a short holiday which normally presents an increase of arrival/departure flights to/from Mexico City. On the other hand, the main transport means of the Mexican population is by far terrestrial by bus. Unfortunately, we only have data on the number of bus passengers outbound from Mexico City, reported by the large bus terminals Norte, Sur, Poniente and Oriente. We will assume that on average the number of bus passengers that arrive to Mexico City is greater than those that leave.",

This estimate is plausible since the first cases in Mexico were reported on February 28th but given that the incubation period is of 6 days they likely arrived to Mexico City on February 21st or 22nd. We also set the population size of the Greater Metropolitan Area of Mexico City at 25 210 748 inhabitants. To estimate the inbound/outbound international travelers migration rates, we take into account all flights that arrive/leave Mexico City [16] . Thus, the daily average number of international arrival and departure air travelers are L im = 22, 519 and L mi = 21, 838, respectively. See Appendix G for the procedure followed to give this estimates. To estimate the inbound/outbound national travelers migration rates we integrate air and terrestrial transportation. For national flights we arbitrarily select the thirteen more important destinations from Mexico City, i.e., those who have more passengers inbound leaving from Mexico City. On the other hand, to estimate the number of terrestrial passengers, we use data from the above mentioned four main bus terminals of Mexico City. Therefore, we calculate the averages per day of national passengers in both kinds of transport (airplane and bus). Thus L sm = 141, 664 and L ms = 141, 425 except during the Holy Week (for more details see Appendix G). For the 2020 Holy Week (April 4th to April 12th), we proceed to increase previous estimates by 25% which is a rough and conservative approximation based on data from the Secretariat of Tourism [17] . Therefore L sm = 177, 080 and L ms = 176, 781 during this period and also the information available on the main bus terminals of Mexico City (for further details see Appendix G). Finally, the incubation and the infectious period are set to \u03b3 = 1/6 and \u03b7 = 1/10 per day, respectively. Also, since we do not have data on the air passenger percentage that arrives in the latent or asymptomatic stage, we propose as a plausible valueq = 0.5 as a null hypothesis from which to start our analysis.",

When considering one IPD, we see that few states receive at least one exported case from Mexico City (Cancun, Guadalajara and Monterrey). On the other hand, with three IPD, these states import 4, 3 and 3 cases from Mexico City, respectively. Figure 5 (b) shows the exported cumulative cases for terrestrial transportation. Here, if the imported cases per day (IPD) is one, then Puebla, Jalisco, Michoacan, Guerrero, and Queretaro import 4, 5, 3, 2 and 1 cases up to Aril 21st from Mexico City, respectively; while if IPD is equal to three, then Puebla, Jalisco, Michoacan, Guerrero, and Queretaro import 13, 16, 9, 7 and 4 infections from Mexico City, respectively. Figure 6 shows the expected number of exported cumulative cases to several Mexican cities. We simulate the number of cases until April 21st.

Figure 7 illustrates the behavior of the contact rates for asymptomatics\u03b2 a (t) and for symptomatics\u03b2 s (t). For both rates, the efficacy of education on the behavioral change is the same since we assume that education is not related to symptomatology although there is some evidence that this might not be the case. A first result is that if the time it takes to obtain the desired contact rate reduction \u03b8 increases then the reduction rate of both contact rates is slower. 9 show that if the time it takes to achieve a reduction in contact rate increases then the number of infectious cases is greater reflecting the slow rate of behavioral change. Figure 8 a) and b) show the prevalence and cumulative incidence respectively, for an scenario with a target reduction of contact rate of 25%, the initiation of the behavioral change is T \u03b8 = 15 days after 10 cases are detected and where 80% of those are asymptomatic. For comparison, a red dashed line shows the epidemic curves when no behavioral change is enforced. Here we see that although the reduction of contact rate is low (25%) (q 1 = 0.75), in the long run behavioral change helps to reduce the incidence. We also note that in addition to the reduction in cases, as the time to achieve the contact rate reduction increases, the epidemic outbreak starts earlier and is larger. Figure 9 shows the behavior of the prevalence (a) and cumulative incidence (b) when the contact rate is reduced by 50% (q 1 = 0.5). In this situation the relevance of the behavioral change to reduce the incidence is rather clear. Notice that if the time necessary 12 .

Larger learning times do not have an impact on the size of the epidemic. Figures 10-12 show examples of the behavior of the cumulative incidence (at 180 days after 10 infected are detected which we use as the indicator of initiation of the outbreak in this example) as a function of certain parameter values. Figure 10 shows that if T \u03b8 is closer to the time of detection of the first cases (in this example, when 10 infected people are detected), then the cumulative incidence can be reduced more efficiently and underlines the importance of reducing the effective contact rate quickly. In our example even when the reduction is only of 50%, we see that the final cumulative incidence decreases to low levels. This observation contrasts with what is shown in Figures 8 and 9 . We will discuss this in more detail later. On the other hand, Figure 10 (b) shows that even when the time it takes to get the contact rate reduction is large (\u03b8 = 90 days), we can still recover a large reduction in the final cumulative incidence provided we have a quick response to enforce reduced contacts and a large target reduction in the effective contact rate. Figure 11 shows that when T \u03b8 = 15 days, regardless of the time \u03b8 it takes to obtain the contact rate reduction, the final cumulative incidence is very low for large reductions in contact rates (q 1 small) or high for low reductions in contact rate (q 1 large).",

Figure 13 shows the contact rates for the isolated environment. For both rates, the reduction of contact is 90% (q 1 = 0.1), the day of initial isolation is January 26th. We can impose a fast behavioral change because we think that this process lasted a short time (7 days) in Wuhan. Figure 14 presents the case when the 99% of population is isolated. Observe that the peak incidence is approximately 4 935 individuals and it occurs 2 days after isolation began (January 26th, [20] ) Figure 14(b) ). Our simulations show that carrying out an isolation process promotes an earlier decrease in incidence. On the other hand, considering a total population equal to 14 million [21] the prevalence at the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan is around 19 000 cases which is a gross underestimate of the true observed value [6] . A better estimate of the at-risk population in Wuhan would, we believe, improve or estimate. Figure 15 shows a comparison of the estimated cumulative incidence (blue line) versus the data reported by the WHO (red cross) for the Hubei province [20] . Our curves overestimate the data, which may be reasonable due the known under-reporting of cases and to the fact that initially there are fewer cases making it difficult to detect them. Nonetheless we see that when the real epidemic curve begins to stabilize, the difference between both data and model decreases, which can be explained if we accept that, at this stage, there are many more cases and it is easier to identify them. Also under-reporting decreases for the same reason. The black point on the model cumulative incidence (blue curve) indicates the inflection point.

We show in Figure 16 the incidence and cummulative incidence under reductions in contact rates of 25%, 50% and 75%, and for \u03b8 = 7 days. Our simulations show that for these reductions in contact rates, a reduction of up to 91% in incidence can be obtained. However, if we take the first 35 weeks after the arrival of the first imported case, Figure 16 (b) shows that depending on the contact rate reduction, we could reach a similar situation to that of Wuhan with 69 050 total cases, (q 1 = 0.75), or a medium level situation with 10 800 total cases (q 1 = 0.50) or a more manageable situation with 4 351 total cases, (q 1 = 0.25). Figure 17 shows the scenario for different \u03b8, the time it takes to get the desired contact rate reduction. In this case isolation also begins on March 23rd and the reduction in contact rates is 60%. We observe that by increasing the value of this parameter, the peak and cumulative incidence will be higher. For example, if the time it takes to reduce the contact rates is \u03b8 = 7 days, then the cumulative incidence 16 weeks after the arrival of the first imported case will be 6 532, while if the time is \u03b8 = 15 days, then the incidence rises to 8 909.

In summary large learning times do not have an impact on the size of the epidemic. Figure 10 shows that if T \u03b8 is closer to the time of detection of the first cases (in this example, 10 infected people), then the cumulative incidence can be reduced more efficiently and underlines the importance of reducing the effective contact rate quickly. Figure 10 (b) shows that although the time it takes to get the contact rate reduction is high (\u03b8 = 90 days), we still can obtain a large reduction in the final cumulative incidence provided we have a quick response to enforce reduced contacts and a large target reduction in the effective contact rate. Figure 11 shows that when T \u03b8 = 15 days, regardless of the time \u03b8 it takes to obtain the contact rate reduction, the final cumulative incidence is very low for large reductions in contact rates (q 1 small) or high for low reductions in contact rate (q 1 large). Figure 10 (a) and 12 show the importance of reducing the contact rate for flattening the epidemic curve. On any scenario, a large reduction of the effective contact rate is necessary (Figure 12 (a)). Figures 12(b) shows an example where an insufficient reduction of the contact rate (40%), leads to a very weak reduction on the final cumulative incidence.",

To select the prior for parameter r, we consider that previous estimation of r are close to 0.3 [15] , and a Gamma(2,1) represent a weekly informative prior as it allows for a wide range of values of r. Also, there is no available prior information regarding the final size of the outbreak K. This is a critical parameter in the model and, in order to avoid bias, we assume a uniform prior over K min and K max . To set these last to values, we consider that the minimum number of confirmed cases is the current number of observed cases Y (t n ) times nine, i.e. K min = y n * 9. The reasoning behind this number is that it has been suggested that the observed cases are under reported by a factor of nine (REF). To set the upper bound for K, we consider a fraction of the total population K max = N * 0.01, where N is the population size of Mexico. This fraction was determined base on the observations of other countries such as Italy where the proportion of infected represents one of the worst case scenarios considering its population size. Then, the posterior distribution of the parameters of interest is \u03c0(\u03b8|y 1 , . . . , y n ) \u221d \u03c0(y 1 , . . . , y n |\u03b8)\u03c0(\u03b8), and it does not have an analytical form since the likelihood function depends on the solution of the Richards model, which must be approximated numerically. We analyze the posterior distribution using an MCMC algorithm that does not require tuning called t-walk s [25] . This algorithm generates samples from the posterior distribution that can be used to estimate marginal posterior densities, mean, variance, quantiles, etc. We refer the reader to [26] for more details on MCMC methods and to [27] for an introduction to Bayesian inference with differential equations. We run the t-walk for 100,000 iterations, discard the first 25000 and use 1,000 samples to generate estimates of the parameters and short-term predictions for the next 14 days.",
