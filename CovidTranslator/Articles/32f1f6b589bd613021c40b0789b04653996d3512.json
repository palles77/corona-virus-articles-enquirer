From these cDNA sequences, it has been possible to identify potential initiation and termination codons and open reading frames capable of encoding polypeptide products of a predicted size. The availability of these cDNA clones has also permitted the construction of various types of vectors for translational studies, including in vivo expression vectors and in vitro transcription vectors. Eukaryotic expression vectors using various high-efficiency promoters have made possible the analysis of protein synthesis in vivo using constructions that encode chimeric mRNAs possessing defined mutations in regions of potential regulatory importance, and/or chimeric mRNAs specifying \"reporter\" genes that facilitate assays for translational expression. In vitro transcription vectors with SP6 and T7 promoters have made possible the efficient synthesis of wild-type and mutant mRNAs that can be examined for their translational activity with a variety of different cell-free proteinsynthesizing systems. In addition, the ability to identify and quantitate the expression within infected or transfected cells of proteins predicted from cDNA sequences has been facilitated by the production of antibodies against synthetic peptides having the amino-acid sequences deduced from open reading frames revealed by cDNA sequence data, and antibodies produced against recombinant fusion proteins produced in bacteria. Primer extension analysis, S 1protection analysis, and RNA \"blotting\" and hybridization have been used to demonstrate the presence of mRNAs in uiuo that possess a particular 5' region in which potential translation initiation codons are localized. Thus, much experimental evidence exists for the occurrence of functionally polycistronic mRNAs, specific examples of which are considered in the following section, which emphasizes their possible mechanisms of expression.",

The efficiency of initiation of transla- tion is thought to be modulated, at least in part, by the position and context of the initiation codon (5, 10, 12, (80) (81) (82) (83) . If the 5'-proximal initiation codon is in an optimal context, initiation at that codon is efficient. If the context of the 5'-proximal initiation codon is suboptimal, initiation at that codon is inefficient. Although a fraction of the scanning ribosomes may indeed initiate translation at a suboptimal 5'-proximal initiation codon, a portion of the 4 0 3 ribosomal subunits would presumably bypass the suboptimal codon and initiate downstream at an internal AUG codon positioned in a more favorable context. This \"leaky scanning\" model provides a mechanism for the initiation of translation at internal initiation codons that would be present in polycistronic mRNAs (12) .",

A purine in position -3 and a guanine in position +4 were optimal for efficient initiation at 5'-proximal AUG codons. Furthermore, the efficiency of initiation was, to a large extent, modulated by the context-that is, the -3/+4 nucleotide positions flanking the 5'-proximal AUG-rather than by the relative distance of the AUG from the 5' end of the mRNA (S, 10-12, [80] [81] [82] [83] .",

Thus, some of the scanning 40-S ribosomal subunits would presumably be able to \"leak\" past the suboptimal initiation site of the upstream cistron and con-tinue scanning until reaching the optimal initiation site of the downstream cistron, present in either the same or a different reading frame. The relative efficiency of utilization of the upstream and downstream cistron initiation codons by ribosomes scanning the same mRNA is of possible regulatory importance, as certain polycistronic mRNAs appear to be organized so that the relative abundance of the proteins encoded by different cistrons correlates with the relative strength of the nucleotides flanking the initiation sites of the cistrons.",

            "text": "One mechanism by which one gene can encode two forms of a protein that differ only in the amino-terminal region is the production of one mRNA transcript from which translation initiation can occur alternatively at one of two in-frame initiation codons. A number of animal virus genes encode mRNA species in which different in-frame AUG initiation sites are utilized in a manner such as to generate related protein products that differ in their amino-terminal sequences. For example, the following viral polycistronic mRNAs each encode two or more proteins in the same reading frame: simian virus 40 (SV40) late 19-S mRNAs encoding capsid proteins VP2 and VP3 (13-1 5) ; the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene mRNA encoding 17) ; the human T-cell leukemia virus subgenomic mRNA encoding the rex and tax nonstructural regulatory proteins (1 8) ; the rotavirus segment8 mRNA encoding 38-kDa and 35-kDa VP7 capsid glycoproteins (19) ; and the Newcastle disease virus mRNA encoding capsid phosphoprotein P and nonstructural 38-and 29-kDa C-like nonstructural proteins (20) . In each of these cases (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) , the upstream or 5'-proximal AUG initiation site is in a suboptimal -3/+4 context relative to the downstream AUG initiation site. (21, 32) ; and the reovirus S1 mRNA 5'-proximal AUG encoding the less abundant sigma-1 protein is in a weak -3/+4 context as compared to the internal AUG encoding sigma-lNs, which is in a strong context and is more efficiently synthesized in vitro than is sigma-1 (40-44, 103). suggest that nucleotides other than the previously identified consensus context nucleotides flanking the initiator AUG codon at the -3 (purine) and +4 (guanine) positions are also important and perhaps even play a dominant role in determining the efficiency of translation in animal cells. Conceivably, mRNA primary or higher ordered structures responsible for the differential ability of mRNAs to interact with mRNA binding initiation factors such as eIF-4A and eIF-4F may, in some cases, be a major determinant of the translational efficiency of 5'-capped mRNAs (86, 100) . Thus, the selection of an \"authentic\" initiation codon with an appropriate efficiency may well be the consequence of collective contributions of many parameters, including both cis-acting sequences such as the -3/+4 context nucleotides, and truns-acting components such as protein synthesis-initiation factors that may discriminate among different mRNAs by virtue of different mRNA binding affinities.",

Surprisingly (136) . By contrast, analysis of a series of poliovirus deletion mutants identified a functional cis-acting element within the 5'-untranslated sequences of poliovirus mRNA that enables it to translate in a cap-independent manner (112, 113, 115) . The major determinant of the polio capindependent translational element maps between nucleotides 320 and 631 from the 5' end of the poliovirus mRNA and is functional both in vivo (113) and in vitro (112, 113) . Translation in vitro of SP6 transcripts containing additional deletions in the 5'-noncoding region more narrowly focused the cis-acting element responsible for capindependent translation, as measured in a mixed rabbit reticulocyte-HeLa system, to a 60-nucleotide sequence located between positions 567 and 627 (115) . The (101) . The second cistron is not expressed when the CAT 5'-untranslated region is the intercistronic spacer (101) . Deletion analysis of the poliovirus 5'-untranslated region suggests that the internal ribosome binding site occupies several hundred nucleotides located between nucleotides 140 and 630 of the poliovirus 5'-untranslated region (101) . It is unclear whether internal ribosome binding is directed toward a specific AUG or whether the internal binding is followed by scanning. However, because the introduction of a hairpin secondary structure (AG\" = -30 kcal/mol) at position 631 of the polio RNA dramatically inhibits translation initiation from the downstream AUG, it has been proposed that the ribosomes, following internal binding, are translocated by scanning until they reach the initiator AUG located at position 745 of the poliovirus mRNA (101) .",

In HeLa cell extracts, internal binding to the 5'noncoding region of poliovirus mRNA in a bicistronic context is independent of an upstream open reading frame (139) . Data obtained with EMC virus RNA are also consistent with an internal binding of ribosomes to mRNA that is followed by scanning toward the initiator AUG site (102, 105) . It appears that internal initiation sites are also utilized during the translation in vitro of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) NS mRNA encoding the phosphoprotein NS(P) (55), adenovirus mRNA encoding the viral DNA polymerase (56) , and hepatitis B virus (HBV) pregenomic mRNA encoding the viral reverse transcriptase (141) . In the case of HBV, combined genetic and biochemical studies both in cell culture and in ducks reveal that the reverse transcriptase is synthesized by a mechanism involving translation initiation at an internal pol AUG codon rather than by ribosomal frameshifting within the core-pol overlap (141) . In these cases, the internal initiation occurs at an AUG positioned several hundred nucleotides downstream from, but in-frame with, the 5'-proximal AUG.

In addition, utilization of CUG as an initiation codon has been described for c-myc mRNA (26). The adeno-associated virus, Sendai virus, and c-myc mRNAs that utilize a non-AUG initiation codon display certain similarities: two or more independent translation-initiation sites are utilized on the same mRNA; the non-AUG initiation codon is located upstream from the AUG initiation codon( s); and, the non-AUG initiation codon is generally utilized less efficiently than the downstream AUG initiation codon (22, 24-26)."

The coupling of the reading frames requires that the ribosome shifts correctly from one reading frame to the other at a discrete position on the mRNA so as to avoid termination of polypeptide synthesis (125) . Frameshifting permits the production of two unique polypeptide products from a single mRNA by initiation of translation at a single site, but subsequent termination of translation at different sites in different reading frames. Termination of protein synthesis at different sites is the result of translational frameshifting that causes a fraction of the ribosomes to change reading frame at a discrete position on the mRNA. Several retroviruses utilize such a frameshifting strategy Most, if not all, retroviruses express the gag-encoded viral core proteins in the form of a gag-polyprotein precursor that is processed by a virus-encoded protease; the pol-encoded reverse transcriptase and integrase proteins are normally expressed at much lower levels by a similar proteolytic processing of a large, fused gag-pol precursor polypeptide (103,126) . However, the genetic structure of the gag-pol domains of the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) genome (61) , the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I and -11) genomes (62) , the bovine leukemia virus genome (63) , the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) genome (64) , and the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) genome (65) seemingly would preclude the synthesis of a gag-pol fusion protein, because the gag and pol genes are in different reading frames.

The same sequence also appears in the gag-pol overlap of RSV (61) and the pro-pol overlap of MMTV (65, 66) . The exact molecular mechanism of translational frameshifting in animal cell systems is not yet known, but in RSV, HIV and MMTV, the frameshifting events may involve a slippage of the leucyl-tRNA reading the UUA codon back to the -1-frame UUU codon (64, 137) . However, a larger sequence context, possibly including secondary structure within the region flanking the site of the frameshift event, also appears necessary for frameshifting, because synthetic oligonucleotides containing either of the MMTV overlap regions inserted into novel contexts do not induce frameshifting (66) . Indeed, the effects of deletion and sitedirected mutations best correlate with the potential to form an RNA stem-loop structure adjacent to the frame-shift site. A 147-nucleotide sequence from RSV RNA containing the frameshift site and stemloop structure is sufficient to direct frameshifting in a novel genetic context (137). The efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting during translation of the mRNA encoding gag and the gag-pol fusion is about 5% within the RSV gag-pol overlap (61) and about 10% within the HIV gag-pol overlap (64) .

To circumvent this apparent block to synthesis of the gag-pol leukemia virus fusion proteins, MuLV and FeLV utilize a strategy of termination codon suppression in which ribosomes \"read-through\" the inframe stop codon. The MuLV protease is located at the 5' end of the pol gene and is synthesized within the precursor gag-pol fusion protein by suppression of an amber (WAG) termination codon located at the 3' end of the gag gene (67) . The first four amino-terminal amino acids of the protease are derived from the gag gene; the fifth residue, glutamine, is derived through suppression of the in-frame amber termination codon located at the gag-pol junction (67) . Similar to MuLV (67) , the FeLV protease is likewise synthesized through in-frame suppression of the gag amber termination codon by insertion of a glutamine residue at the UAG codon (68) . Based on precedents from prokaryotic systems, natural suppression of the nonsense termination codon present in the MuLV and FeLV mRNAs presumably occurs by a mechanism involving suppressor tRNAs that possess altered anticodons (127) . Normal mouse cells contain a natural WAG suppressor glutamine tRNA, representing about 1-2% of the total glutamine tRNA (133, 134) . The supressor glutamine tRNA may be increased in some cells infected with MuLV (133) and selectively decreased in cells treated with Avarol,' a sesquiterpenoid hydroquinone displaying anti-MuLV activity (134) . Indeed, nonsense suppressor tRNAs active in mammalian cells have been constructed using site-specific mutagenesis of cloned tRNA genes. The biological activity of these recombinant suppressor tRNAs was directly demonstrated by suppression of termination of nonsense codons introduced into cDNA clones encoding animal virus mRNAs (128) (129) (130) . However, in principle, either the primary or a higher ordered structure of the MuLV or FeLV mRNA templates could also affect the efficiency of suppression of termination by affecting the competition between the protein-synthesis release factors promoting termination and the tRNA species mediating suppression by promoting read-through. Analysis of recombinant fusion genes consisting of the viral gag-pol junction upstream and in the same reading frame as the E . coli l a d gene revealed that gag amber codon suppression in these constructs does not require augmented levels of suppressor tRNA species (98) . Rather, suppression is caused by an intrinsic cis-acting component of the viral mRNA (98) .",

The insertion of AUG initiation codons upstream from the \"authentic\" AUG used to initiate translation of the downstream HB,Ag gene could severely depress the initiation of translation at the \"authentic\" AUG codon. Such inhibition could, however, be at least partially suppressed by the presence of a translational termination codon in-frame with the upstream AUG (76) . These (74, 75, 77) , but not always (75, 77) , markedly reduces the efficiency of translation of a downstream cistron. Furthermore, the relative position of the terminator codon of the upstream cistron's open reading frame appears to be a critical parameter in determining expression from the downstream, internal cistron. Some evidence suggests that efficient reinitiation of translation can occur at an internal downstream AUG if the translation that initiated from the upstream AUG codon terminates about 80 to 150 nucleotides before the downstream AUG (77) . However, other evidence suggests that reinitiation can occur at an internal AUG if the translation that initiated from the upstream AUG codon terminates within about 20 to 50 nucleotides either before or after the downstream AUG (74, 75) .

Translation termi-nation-reinitiation may occur when the termination codon of the upstream cistron either precedes or is in the close vicinity of the initiation site of the downstream second cistron. The evidence supporting reinitiation following termination is derived from a number of different translational systems, both in ~i t r o and in ~i o o , and for both viral and cellular mRNAs (69) (70) (71) (72) (73) (74) (75) (76) (77) 79) . Hopefully, future studies will establish which of the multiple mechanisms so far described for the translation of polycistronic animal virus mRNAs are used likewise for the translation of polycistronic cellular mRNAs. Future studies may also better identify and characterize the parameters important in the regulated translation of polycistronic mRNAs, parameters including cis-acting primary sequences or higher ordered structures of the mRNA, and trans-acting protein factors of the protein-synthesis machinery.",

Such fundamentally important conclusions have been made possible, in part, by the availability of nucleotide and peptide sequences of a number of animal virus genomes and their encoded products, together with complete cDNA clones of animal virus genomes and mRNAs that can be manipulated by recombinant DNA techniques to generate synthetic mRNAs or mutated versions of authentic mRNAs. Careful analyses of various viral mRNAs have now made it clear that some viral mRNAs are indeed recognized and translated as functionally polycistronic mRNAs by the protein-synthesizing machinery of animal cells. Furthermore, many different biochemical mechanisms may exist in animal cells to permit the expression of functionally polycistronic viral mRNAs.",

For example, the influenza virus B segment 6 NB/NA mRNA encodes two glycoproteins in different overlapping reading frames, the neuraminidase NA protein and a nonstructural glycoprotein NB (47,48). The -3/+4 context of the 5'-proximal AUG initiation site used for NB synthesis is more favorable than the context of the downstream AUG initiation codon used for NA synthesis, yet NA and NB accumulate to approximately equal amounts in infectedcells (48,138). Furthermore, mutations in the sequence immediately around the5'-proximal AUG codon do not make a large difference in the amounts of NB and NA that accumulate in transfected cells, but when the 5' AUG is displaced from its normal position it becomes efficient at preventing downstream initiation events (138). The coronavirus gene 5 mRNA of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) also possesses two open reading frames. Although MHV polypeptides corresponding in size to both gene-5 mRNA reading frames are synthesized in vitro from pGEM transcripts, so far only the second open reading frame product has been shown to be expressed within MHV-infected cells, and the -3/+4 context of the AUG initiation site for this reading frame is not optimal (49-51 ).

These findings were extended and confirmed by the analysis of artificial bicistronic mRNAs that contained, in order from 5' to 3', the 5'-noncoding region of poliovirus connected to the coding region of the sea oncogene as the first indicator gene followed by truncated versions of the 5'-noncoding region of EMC virus connected to the poliovirus 2A coding region as the second indicator gene (102). The translation in vitro of run-off T7 polymerase transcripts of the chimeric polio(sea)-EMC (2A) constructs revealed that a specific, internal ribosome entry site probably exists within the 5'-noncoding region of EMC virus RNA. The translational efficiency of the second 2A cistron was not reduced in the presence of a poorly translated first sea cistron as long as the second reporter cistron remained under the control of the 5'-noncoding region of EMC virus RNA. Deletion analysis revealed that the EMC RNA 5'-noncoding sequence between nucleotides 260 and 484 plays a critical role in the efficient translation of adjacent coding sequences, in both mono-and bicistronic mRNAs, presumably because the internal ribosomal entry site resides within this region of the EMC RNA (102).",

The fact that divergence of picornavirus 5'-noncoding sequences occurs in a manner that permits conservation of certain overall structural features-including over 20 stem and loop structures, two pyrimidine-rich regions and long stretches of conserved sequence-suggests important functional roles for the 5'noncoding region, possibly mediated as much by overall structure as by specific primary sequence. Undoubtedly, the conserved 5'noncoding structure of picornavirus mRNAs plays important roles in several stages of the virus multiplication cycle, perhaps including protein synthesis.

Careful genetic and biochemical analyses have firmly established that the protein-synthesizing machinery of animal cells can indeed recognize and translate polycistronic viral mRNAs. The translation of polycistronic mRNAs involves multiple initiation and/or termination codons in a manner that permits the synthesis of multiple primary translational products from a single, mature mRNA. Several different biochemical mechanisms appear to allow the translation of polycistronic mRNAs by the protein-synthesizing machinery of animal cells. Indeed, different mechanisms can best account for the translational expression of different polycistronic mRNAs. For example, for some polycistronic viral mRNAs, translation-initiation appears to occur by the binding of the 40-S ribosomal subunit at or near the mRNA 5' terminus and a subsequent \"leaky\" scanning in which alternative initiation codons are recognized as functional initiation sites. For other mRNAs, translation-initiation appears to occur by the binding of ribosomal subunits to internal sequences, or by reinitiation following termination without prior dissociation of the ribosomal subunits from the mRNA. Certain polycistronic mRNAs utilize a non-AUG codon, for example, ACG, to initiate translation of one of the cistrons. Finally, the translation of polycistronic mRNAs, in some cases, is by mechanisms in which alternative termination codons are used to terminate translation, either as the result of ribosomal frameshifting during elongation, or by suppression of an in-frame termination signal. Many of the molecular genetic mechanisms of eukaryotic gene expression first elucidated from studies of animal viruses have subsequently been shown to be used for the expression of cellular genes.",

Expression of the reporter enzyme from the chimeric mRNA is extensively augmented by poliovirus-mediated inhibition of capdependent protein synthesis. The cap-independent translation-initiation on poliovirus (1 01, 104, 115) and EMC virus (102, 105) mRNAs appears to occur by a mechanism that involves binding of ribosomes to an internal sequence within the 5'-noncoding region. A bicistronic plasmid containing the herpes simplex thymidine kinase gene as the first cistron and the CAT gene as the second cistron does not express the first cistron in poliovirus-infected COS cells but does express the second cistron when the poliovirus 5'-untranslated region is inserted as the intercistronic spacer",

The hybrid-arrest translation results suggest that leaky scanning of ribosomes from the 5' end of these viral mRNAs to the respective internal initiation sites does not occur to an appreciable extent. However, additional studies are necessary further to support this interpretation. The formation of RNA . DNA duplex structures may inhibit translation by two mechanisms: the duplex may exert a direct steric effect that affects the binding of factors or the movement of ribosomes; alternatively, the mRNA may be cleaved at the site of the duplex by RNase H present in the reticulocyte lysate",

Prior to DNA replication, the start site of early-early RNA is at map position 5235-5237, whereas following DNA replication two start sites are observed, one for late-early RNA located at m.p. 22-28 and the other \u20acor far upstream late-early RNA at m.p.35-43.  During the switch from early-early to late-early transcription, the shift in the start site of the SV40 early RNAs results in the introduction of AUG initiation codons in the 5'-noncoding region of the late-early mRNA. The introduction of the upstream AUG codons contributes to a reduced translational efficiency of the mRNAs encoding the tumor antigens. When SP6 transcripts are prepared and translated in a wheat system, the early-early RNA is a 3to 6-fold more efficient mRNA for synthesis o f t antigen, and presumably also T antigen, than is the late-early mRNA; furthermore, the early-early RNA is about a 10-fold better mRNA than the far upstream late-early mRNA. If AUG initiation codons followed by in-frame termination codons occur inthe 5'-noncoding region upstream from the authentic initiation codon, minicistrons are created that, in principle, may be translated. Such a situation appears to occur in the case of the SV40 late-early RNA. A 23-residue polypeptide product of the SV40 late-early minicistron has been identified in infected cells; its function is unknown (69). In the case of the human CMV p gene transcript, two short minicistrons of 7 and 35 codons in length occur within the 5'-noncoding leader region of a 170-codon cistron. Transcripts carrying the 5' leader are inefficiently translated as a consequence of the two upstream minicistrons, and the presence of either of the two minicistrons reduces expression of a downstream cistron during viral infection (79). The three RSV mRNAs encoding gag and gag-pol, env, and src contain a common 5'-noncoding leather segment (72, 126). With the spliced RSV src mRNA, the AUG codon used to initiate src protein synthesis is positioned 90 nucleotides downstream from the AUG codon present in the common 5'-leader region used to initiate gag and gag-pol protein synthesis. In addition, an in-frame UGA termination codon lies between the gag and gag-pol AUG and the src AUG in the spliced src mRNA. Mutation of the upstream minicistron termination UGA codon to CGA virtually eliminates initiation of translation at the downstream \"authentic\" initiator AUG used for synthesis of the 60-kDa src oncoprotein (72). Perhaps the absence of 60-kDa src synthesis is caused by eliminating the possibility of reinitiation because of the absence of minicistron termination. Conceptually similar results were obtained when the expression of the hepatitis-B surface antigen (HB,Ag) gene was studied in transfected COS cells",
