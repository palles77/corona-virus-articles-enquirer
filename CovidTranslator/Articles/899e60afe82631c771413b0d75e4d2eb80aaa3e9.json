Briefly, 13 recombinant proteins associated with 4 structural proteins (S, E, M, and N) and 5 putative uncharacterized proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, and 9b) of SARS-CoV were prepared and used to screen 58 serum samples from convalescent-phase SARS patients for IgG antibodies specific for these proteins by use of the protein microarray. The cutoff value of the fluorescence intensity for each protein was calculated by using the fluorescence intensity values for this protein with normal human serum. Antibodies to proteins S, 3a, N, and 9b were detected in the sera from convalescentphase SARS patients, whereas antibodies to proteins E, M, 3b, 6, and 7a were not detected. In the present study, when the protein microarray described above was applied to the ELISApositive serum specimens, among the 13 recombinant proteins, only the N protein reacted with 3 of 11 samples, whereas all 11 samples were negative for antibodies to the other main antigenic proteins of SARS-CoV (Table 1 ). The results revealed by protein microarray analysis were further confirmed by an N protein-based antigen-capturing ELISA (Table 1 ). This recombinant full-length N protein-based ELISA kit (Sino-American Bioengineering Co.) could detect the total antibodies (IgG, IgM, IgA, etc.) to the N protein of SARS-CoV (7).",

The reason is likely that the concentrations of neutralizing antibodies, such as anti-S antibodies, were too low to neutralize the virus, while the detectable anti-N antibody lacked neutralization activity.

Use of the recombinant N-protein-based protein microarray assay and the antigen-capturing ELISA could reduce the probability of false-positive results, but the possible cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV N protein to other antibodies in humans should also be taken into account. More specific recombinant truncated N protein (6) or other potential candidate antigens, such as S protein, could be further screened and developed for use in reliable serological assays.",
