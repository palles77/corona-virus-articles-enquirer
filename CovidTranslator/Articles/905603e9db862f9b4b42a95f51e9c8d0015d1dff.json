Therefore, we utilize this empirical distribution of reporting delays from the onset to diagnosis to impute the missing dates of onset for the remainder of the cases with missing data. For this purpose, we reconstruct 300 epidemic curves by dates of symptoms onset from which we derived a mean incidence curve of local case incidence and drop the last three data points from the analysis to adjust for reporting delays in our real-time analysis (11) .",

Using the Korean incidence curves for imported and local cases, we estimate the evolution of Rt for COVID-19 in Korea. First, we characterize daily local case incidence using the generalized growth model (GGM) (14) . This model characterizes the growth profile via two parameters: the growth rate parameter ( ) and the scaling of the growth rate parameter ( ). The model captures diverse epidemic profiles ranging from constant incidence ( = 0), sub-exponential or polynomial growth ( 0 < < 1 ), and exponential growth ( = 1 ) (14) . The generation interval is assumed to follow a gamma distribution with a mean of 4.41 days and a standard deviation of 3.17 days (15, 16) .",

The effective reproduction number (Rt) quantifies the time-dependent transmission potential of an infectious diseases outbreak. This key epidemiological parameter tracks the average number of secondary cases generated per case as the outbreak progresses over time. Steady values of Rt above 1 indicate sustained disease transmission, whereas values of Rt <1 do not support sustained transmission and the number of new cases is expected to follow a declining trend. In this report, using a mathematical model parameterized with cases series of the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea, we investigate the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Korea using data of local and imported cases up until February 26, 2020.",
