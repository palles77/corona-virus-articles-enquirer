Hydrothermal Processing (HTP), a set of several chemical digestion processes, could be employed to convert sewage sludge into valuable products and minimize potential environmental pollution risks. Specifically, hydrothermal carbonization and hydrothermal liquefaction have been extensively studied to sustainably manage sludge. Two of the main reasons for this are the high upscaleability of HTP for public waste management and that it is estimated that HTP can recover eleven times more energy from waste products than landfilling. An integration of HTP with anaerobic digestion or recycling the soluble organics (in the HTP aqueous products) into the HTP process could lead to a higher overall rate of energy recovery for municipal sewage sludge.",

Ionic and free radical reactions are believed to be the major reactions in HTL. The kinetics of these reaction pathways have been studied to investigate the relationship between temperature and pressure on reaction yield, with temperature showing a large effect on the output of the process [13] . Sub-critical water exhibits limited interaction with sewage sludge due to low diffusivity and, therefore, acts mainly as a reaction medium [13] . In contrast, super-critical water exhibits higher diffusivity and increases the rate of interaction between solvent and sewage sludge. This conclusion is based on growing evidence that the rate constants of HTL reactions are heavily dependent on pressure in the critical pressure point where water reaches super-critical conditions (i.e., the nearcritical region of water) [20, 21] . The conversion efficiency is highly enhanced when water reaches the super-critical point [12] .",

In fact, the density of water can be changed by adjusting temperature and pressure in the sub-and super-critical states. In the near-critical water region, hydrogen bonding in water is weaker and thus water can serve as a hydrogen donor for sewage sludge conversion. In the super-critical region, however, free radical reactions are dominant because the possibility of generation of radicals from a series of elemental reaction steps grows at high temperatures [13, 20, 21] . In short, the effect of pressure is different on sub-critical and supercritical water. For sub-critical water, temperature is the dominant factor affecting the reaction efficiency while for super-critical water both temperature and pressure play a key role promoting the conversion efficiency.",

The reactor size varied from lab (0.05 L) to pilot scale (35 L). The largest flow rate available in literature was 90L/h from the University of Sydney [10] . A continuous-flow pilot plant reactor was operated at temperatures of 300-350\u02daC.

In comparison, the largest flow rate documented in the literature was 60 L/h from Aarhus University (Denmark) [42] . The residence time was 20 min, which led to a 20 L of reactor volume.

This would be a serious issue especially in the winter, given that sewage sludge may contain high amounts of water (water would freeze in the winter and thus an external heating source is needed for the feeding tank). Secondly, the viscosity of the sewage sludge could be very high and thus slow down its flow rate. Preferably, a 20-25 wt.% of solid content is favored to achieve a net positive energy gain [7, 44] . However, increasing the solid content may decrease the flowability of sewage sludge. The viscosity of the sewage sludge slurry dictates if the pumping system can be stably operated with a constant feedstock flowrate to the reactor. Possible solutions include the development of efficient pumping methods and pretreatments to reduce the viscosity of sewage sludge [40, 45] .",

Conventional incineration systems generally consume more energy than they produce because of the high moisture content in sewage sludge. Alternatively, anaerobic digestion (AD), an oxygen-free microbial fermentation of organics for biomethane generation, could be considered to cope with the increasing quantity of sewage sludge. AD is generally more effective than incineration for energy recovery. AD is also the most common method for sewage sludge stabilization, resulting in the reduction of volatile solids. However, AD usually suffers from poor conversion efficiencies (<50%), slow reaction rates (several weeks), and high capital costs. Moreover, a large volume (>50%) of the wet residual digestate (or AD sludge) would be generated after AD [57] .",

As Figure 1B shows, HTP can recover at least four-times the amount of energy put into in a lab-scale reactor, primarily because HTL can directly treat wet feedstock without drying (but not other methods). Compared to similar technologies for AD sludge management (e.g., landfilling), HTP not only sterilizes the sludge but also converts it into valuable end products with 11-times higher energy recovery and emissions in GHG decreased by 78-85% [2] . Multiple published studies also suggest that an integration of AD and HTP could benefit a resilient water-energy nexus [2, 5] .",

Further research should be done with continuous flow reactors using different types of sewage sludge and co-solvents. Particularly, increasing the sewage sludge concentration to around 20-25% without losing the flowability of the slurry for continuous HTL is critical in terms of process development to industrial scale [40] . A higher solids content of sewage sludge (with a maximum of 35% from a batch scale study) typically can lead to a higher biocrude oil yield. As a result, the energy balance of continuous HTL systems would be improved because energy lost to a volume of water would decrease with a reduction in water content and therefore the production costs can be reduced [9] . One possible method to increase the sewage sludge concertation is pretreatment of sewage sludge. For instance, several pretreatment methods using acid hydrolysis, alkaline treatment , liquid hot water, ammonia and steam explosion were applied to the slurries for enabling their pumpabilty for continuous HTL systems [40, 45, 60] . It was also found that an alkaline environment was preferable for preparing pumpable woody biomass for continuous HTL reactions [45, 60] . Of course, further pretreatment also would further increase overall process costs.",

However, there is room to further study the potential of sewage sludge. For instance, as most wastewater treatment plants produce approximately equal amounts of primary and secondary sludge, testing of appropriate ratios of these feeds will help to shape planning of biocrude production plants. Additionally, increasing the feed solid contents for continuous HTP will improve the economics through decreased capital costs and increased energy efficiency.Sensitivity analysis indicates significant economic benefits are available if the HTP aqueous product (HTP-AP)can be recycled back to the headworks of WWTP. For example, about 30% cost is attributed to HTP-AP treatment",

Co-conversion of waste activated sludge and sawdust through hydrothermal liquefaction: Optimization of reaction parameters using response surface methodology. Appl.

The operating conditions considered in this research include reaction temperature, reaction time and solids concentration for the maximum bio-oil production. A synergetic effect of wastewater sludge and lignocellulosic biomass in HTL was also demonstrated. This paper reports an integrated manure treatment system to remove estrogenic hormones from the liquid portion of animal manure, while convert the biomass into biocrude oil or syngas via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) or catalytic hydrothermal gasification (CHG) at the same time. The maximum HTL biocrude oil yield was 40% and the highest CHG syngas yield was 54%. Heavy metal analysis shows that the majority of the heavy metals from the biosolids (i.e., the liquid portion of animal manure in this study) were attributed to the solid products after HTL.[40] Castello D, Pedersen TH, Rosendahl LA.
