The disappearance of JEV human cases in 2006-2010 could be explained by a sudden reduction of the population of farm pigs as a result of the implementation of the voluntary \"pig-rearing licence surrendering\" policy. The resurgence could be explained by of a new strain in 2011, which increased the transmissibility of the virus or the spill-over ratio from reservoir to host or both.",

The annual total confirmed human cases has decreased substantially from 12,594 cases to 3429 cases between 2006 and 2012, and then resurged to 5399 in 2016 ( Fig. 1 ) . The case-fatality ratio and the rate of permanent neurologic or psychiatric sequelae of patients with encephalitis can be 30% ( Arai et al., 2008; Centers for Disease Control, 2017; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017; Libraty et al., 2002; Mackenzie et al., 2004; Solomon and Winter, 2004; World Health Organization, 2017 ; Lam et al., 2005 ) and over 35% in children ( Kumar et al., 1990 ) . JEV persists in a transmission cycle of pigs, Ardeid birds and mosquitoes. It could infect humans through mosquito bites by Culex tritaeniorhynchus species ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017; Center for Health Protection, 2017; World Health Organization, 2017 ) . Humans are dead-end hosts where they cannot develop viremia to infect mosquitoes. Population sizes of farm pigs and the size of rice land, which favors the Culex mosquitoes' growth, are the two key factors affecting local transmission ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017; Impoinvil et al., 2018; World Health Organization, 2017 ) . * Corresponding author.",

To quantify the tradeoff between the goodness-of-fit of a model and its complexity ( Schwarz, 1978 ) , Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was used for model comparison. Simulations were performed by implementing the Eulermultinomial integration method with a fixed time-step of one day ( Allen et al., 2008; He et al., 2010 ) .

One genetic study found that the genotype 1 strain was not observed until 2008 in the regions of Mainland China surrounding Hong Kong ( Gao et al., 2013 ) . Thus, it is very likely that there is a newly introduced JEV strain from pigs imported from these Mainland Chinese regions ( The Government of Hong Kong, Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, 2017b ); (ii) JEV genotype 5 (G5) strain: Similar JEV resurgences were observed in South Korea in 1998 and 2010 ( Sunwoo et al., 2016 ) . The resurgence in 1998 was likely due to the introduction of G1 strain in the mid-1990's ( Gao et al., 2013; Mackenzie et al., 2004 ) . The first isolated local G5 strain was reported in 2010 in South Korea, which coincided with the resurgence of JEV in 2010 ( Takhampunya et al., 2011 ) , where the average number of annual JEV cases increased approximately six-to eight-fold ( Sunwoo et al., 2016 ) .

The critical community size (CCS) estimated through the model indicates that the pig rearing license surrender policy on May 2006 could be responsible for the disappearance of JEV human during 2006-10, assuming that other factors remain unchanged. Compared with the results of baseline (no invasion) scenario (see S.1.1), our fitting results in the hypothetical scenario imply that the resurgence of JEV in 2011 was likely due to the introduction of new strains which has a higher transmissibility and/or a spill-over ratio.",

The results corresponding to I2 are presented in S.1.3, where the annual transmission rate \u03bb vp is set to be 0.0044 and 0.1763 before and after invasion, respectively. The larger annual force of infection after invasion produces unreasonable IAR p . With parameter values in S.1.3, \u03bb v p = 0 . 1763 and S p0 = 57 . 67% lead to IAR p \u2208 [1255%, 2118%], which is larger than 100%. The mechanism I3 implies increase in both \u03bb vp and \u03c1 after invasion (see S.1.2). With S p0 = 64% , IAR p is increased from [33.98%,57.33%] to [56.10%, 94.67%] after invasion, within acceptable ranges. Therefore, according to the range of IAR p , I1 and I3 are likely to be the possible explanations of the resurgence of JEV epidemics in 2011, while I2 is unlikely since it predicts unreasonable values of IAR p .Furthermore, I3 could be more biologically reasonable than I1 .",
