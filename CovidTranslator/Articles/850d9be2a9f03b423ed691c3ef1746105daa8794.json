Three research groups within a World Health Organization (WHO)-coordinated network have independently and simultaneously shown that a novel coronavirus is linked to SARS. A fourth group has completed the Koch's postulates by infecting monkeys with the agent. Sequencing of the complete genome was achieved only weeks after the first isolate of the virus became available.",

He succumbed to SARS himself on 29 March 2003. Retrospectively, reports from China on cases compatible with the disease date back to November 2002. The disease involves an initial febrile phase that is followed by interstitial pneumonia, leading to respiratory distress syndrome and death in a fraction of patients. The cumulative case fatality rate at the time of writing is 8.4% [1] . On the basis of gamma-distribution models, this number has recently been corrected to values of 13.2% in patients below 60 years of age and 43.3% in those above 60 [2] . When it became clear in mid-March 2003 that hospital outbreaks with high rates of transmission had simultaneously occurred in Hanoi, Singapore, Hong Kong and Toronto (Canada), the WHO issued a global health alert and initiated studies in a network of laboratories, dedicated to clarifying the etiology of SARS [3] . Four recent articles describe how members of the network rapidly identified and confirmed a novel coronavirus as the causative agent in an independent, yet collaborative, manner [4 -7] .",

This gene is present in most group 2 coronaviruses; a common ancestor is thought to have acquired it horizontally from influenza C virus [11, 12] . Like group 1 coronaviruses, the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV, which in many group 2 coronaviruses is cleaved into two domains (S1 and S2), lacks the typical cleavage recognition site. In common with group 3 coronaviruses, SARS-CoV has one instead of two papain-like proteases encoded by open reading frame 1a [10] . Similar to avian infectious bronchitis virus (group 3), the 3 0 -untranslated region of SARS-CoV contains a conserved sequence motif that is thought to have been acquired horizontally from astroviruses [11] .",

The technical path to success was a rather conventional one. Because the agent could be cultured, a combination of classical methods (cell culture, electron microscopy, immunofluorescence) and basic molecular biology techniques (RT-PCR, random priming) has been sufficient for its identification. In other settings, where non-culturable agents were to be found, either moresophisticated molecular techniques like subtractive amplification (representative difference analysis [13] ) or morecomplex combinations of classic and molecular methods have been necessary [14] . With the pathogen and its genome at hand, the necessary steps for diagnosing, treating and studying the pathogenesis of the disease can now be undertaken. The lesson learned from the identification of SARS-CoV is a general rather than a scientific one: in a situation of an impending epidemic, scientists are able to cooperate on a high level of proficiency in an efficient manner. The common trait of scientists to be competitive can be directed into a most productive direction by clever guidance, as demonstrated by the communicable disease surveillance and response team of the WHO.",
