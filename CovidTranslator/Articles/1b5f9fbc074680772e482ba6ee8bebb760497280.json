The SARS-CoV S protein encodes a surface glycoprotein precursor that is predicted to be 1,255 amino acids in length, and the amino terminus and most of the protein is predicted to be on the outside of the cell surface or the virus particles3. The predicted S protein consists of a signal peptide (amino acids 1-12) located at the N terminus, an extracellular domain (amino acids 195 ), a transmembrane domain (amino acids 1, 215) and an intracellular domain (amino acids 1,216--1,255)29-32 (FIG. 2a) . Similarly to other coronaviruses, the S protein of SARS-CoV can be cleaved into the S1 and S2 subunits by proteases, such as trypsin33, factor Xa34 and cathepsin L35. The trypsin cleavage site occurs at R667-S668 (REF. 36 ), whereas cathepsin L cleavage is mapped to T678-M679 in the S protein35. Cathepsin L cleaves the S protein of SARS-CoV upstream of, rather than adjacent to, the fusion peptide, and the cleavage is required for activation of the membrane fusion domain of the S protein following entry into target cells35.",

Crystallographic studies have shown the structure of RBD complexed with its receptor ACE2 ( REFS 29, 40) . During the interaction of RBD with the receptor, RBD presents a concave surface for the N terminus of the receptor peptidase, on which amino acids 445-460 anchor the entire receptor-binding loop of the RBD core (FIG. 2b) . This loop (amino acids 424-494 of the RBD), which makes complete contact with the receptor ACE2, was referred to as receptor-binding motif (RBM) (FIG. 2a) . The RBM region is tyrosine rich. Among the 14 residues of RBM that are in direct contact with ACE2, six are tyrosine, representing both the hydroxyl group and hydrophobic ring. The RBD region also contains multiple cysteine residues that are linked by disulphide bonds29 (FIG. 2c) . Two residues in particular, those at positions 479 and 487, determine SARS disease progression and SARS-CoV tropism (host range)41,42. Any residue changes in these two positions might therefore enhance animal-to-human or human-to-human transmission29.",

Changes of only a few residues in the RBD of the civet SARS-CoV S protein, which is responsible for binding with the peptidase domain of ACE2, result in enhanced human ACE2-binding affinity of SARS-CoVs from animals, including civets, mice and rats, facilitating efficient cross-species infections29. However, the SL-CoV from bats does not infect ACE2-expressing cells7,8, suggesting that, unlike SARS-CoVs from human and civets, the SL-CoV from bats does not use ACE2 as a cellular receptor.

This brings the viral envelope and target cell membrane into close proximity for fusion. The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV fusion core is described in detail in REF. 55 (FIG. 3) . Similarly to the S protein of MHV, but not gp41 of HIV-1, SARS-CoV S protein has a longer HR1 region than HR2 region. The six-helix bundle fusion core has a rod-shaped structure with a length of \u223c70 \u00c5 and a diameter of \u223c28 \u00c5. Three HR1 helices form a parallel trimeric coiled-coil that is surrounded by three HR2 helices in an oblique, antiparallel manner55 (FIG. 3) . A synthetic peptide derived from the HR2 region could interact with an HR1 peptide to form a stable six-helix bundle and inhibit SARS-CoV infection in a dosedependent manner53. Consequently, both the HR1 and HR2 regions in the S2 domains are expected to participate in the viral fusion and entry processes and will serve as attractive targets for the development of anti-SARS-CoV therapeutics and vaccines.",

The RBD strongly reacts with the antisera from patients with SARS in the convalescent phase, and depletion of the RBD-specific antibodies from patients with SARS results in significant elimination of the neu ralizing activity69. Chen et al. 61 have also shown that most neutralizing antibodies of antisera of mice, rabbits and monkeys induced by a live-attenuated MVA virus that expressed the full-length S protein could be absorbed and removed by rRBD. using a fusion protein that contained the RBD linked to human IgG1 Fc fragment (designated RBD-Fc) as an immunogen, we have successfully induced highly potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV BJ01 strain in immunized rabbits with neutralizing titres greater than 1:10,000 (REF. It should be noted that the efficacy of these vaccine candidates is mainly tested in young-mouse and primate animal models. These models are usually less robust, providing virus replication but lacking clinical symptoms and diseases. It is necessary, therefore, to develop more-robust animal models of human diseases for evaluation of vaccine efficacy. Baric and colleagues78, 79 have recently reported several lethal SARS-CoV challenge models in BALB/c mice that recapitulated the age-related SARS disease by using recombinant SARS-CoV that bore the S protein of early human and zoonotic strains (GZ02 and HC/SZ/61/03, respectively). They also developed another pathogenic model for young mice after 15 passages of the urbani isolate in BALB/c mice, which resulted in a lethal virus, MA15, that replicates to high titres in the lungs of mice, causing clinical disease of SARS78,79. Other reports80,81 list examples for the use of senescent mouse models for vaccine evaluation. One candidate vaccine, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles, that expressed the urbani SARS-CoV S protein partially protected the aged mice from challenge with a recombinant heterologous SARS-CoV that bore epidemic and zoonotic S proteins (icGDO3-S), providing a model to mimic the age-related susceptibility observed in the elder population80.

One of the HR2 peptides, T20 (enfuvirtide), was approved by the uS Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with HIV or AIDS, especially those who have failed to respond to the current antiretroviral drugs. These HR2 peptides could interact with the viral gp41 HR1 region at fusion-intermediate conformation and block six-helix bundle formation, resulting in the inhibition of HIV fusion at the nanomolar level87,88. Because the SARS-CoV S protein S2 domain also contains HR1 and HR2 sequences, we anticipated that peptides derived from the HR2 region of the SARS-CoV S protein S2 domain would also have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV. We designed and synthesized several peptides that overlapped the HR2 sequence and found that one of these, designated CP-1, could interact with an HR1 peptide to form a stable six-helix bundle and inhibited infection by SARS-CoV WHu strain in Vero E6 cells with an IC 50 of approximately 20 \u03bcM53. Later, several other research groups also identified anti-SARS-CoV peptides from the S2 domain HR2 region that had viral fusion inhibitory activity at the micromolar level84, 89,90. An NMR study has shown that in the pre-fusion intermediate state, the HR2 region forms a symmetric coiled-coil trimer, which has not been observed for other class I viral fusion proteins. The poor antiviral activity of anti-SARS-CoV peptides, compared with the anti-HIV peptides, could be attributed to the tendency of the SARS-CoV S protein HR2 region to form the trimeric coiled-coil. Replacement of the key residues in the HR2 peptide to reduce its ability to form the trimer, but increase its affinity of binding with the HR1 region, to form the six-helix bundle could lead to improvement of its antiviral efficacy. The peptidic antiviral drugs for SARS and other emerging infectious diseases with short incubation periods could have more advantages than the anti-HIV drug enfuvirtide, as enfuvirtide must be injected twice per day for the patient's lifetime. This results in an intolerable injection-site reaction and a high cost to patients, whereas a few injections of the peptidic drugs against SARS-CoV in the early stage of the acute phase could be enough to save patients' lives. One of the disadvantages of using HR2-based peptide inhibitors is the potential selection of escape mutants with altered host-range phenotypes91. Mouse mAbs that target other fragments of the SARS-CoV S protein (for example, amino acids 1,143-1,157) could also effectively inhibit SARS-CoV infection56,93. These neutralizing mouse mAbs can be administered to patients with SARS for early and urgent treatment of SARS-CoV infection9, but cannot be repeatedly used owing to the risk of a human-anti-mouse antibody response. Such a response could rapidly clear the murine antibody from the blood, thus preventing the mouse antibodies from producing the desired therapeutic effect and causing the patient to have an allergic reaction94. Some antibodies against trimeric S protein have the potential to mediate Fc\u03b3RII-dependent entry into B cells in vitro and thereby cause antibody-dependent enhancement62. ",

            "text": "Overall, the feasibility of using peptides and small molecules as anti-SARS therapeutics is partially limited by their low antiviral potency. Furthermore, the possibility of enhancing viral entry might restrict mAbs as immunotherapeutics for long-term use. It is likely, however, that S protein-based vaccines will bear fruit in the near future, as they have been proven to induce long-term and potent neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV. But the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in elderly and lethal-challenge models, and their protection against zoonotic virus infection, should be determined before a clinical study is initiated. To take these factors into full consideration, a combination of different strategies with multiple vaccines and antiviral therapeutics may be needed to induce broad and cross protection against various virus strains, especially isolates that have mutated quickly. Early clinical studies that were based on such strategies have been carried out, but it is difficult to push the clinical trials of these candidate vaccines and therapeutics forwards owing to a lack of SARS-CoV-infected subjects and insufficient financial support. Thus, most big pharmaceutical companies have no interest in developing SARS vaccines and therapeutics because of the concern of profitability. However, studies on SARS will provide important information for designing novel strategies for prophylaxis and therapies of other newly emerging infections caused by enveloped viruses with class I fusion proteins.",

S protein first binds to the cellular receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2)129, and the ACE2-virus complex is then translocated to endosomes, where S protein is cleaved by the endosomal acid proteases (cathepsin L)105 to activate its fusion activity. The viral genome is released and translated into viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and 1ab, which are then cleaved into small products by viral proteinases. Subgenomic negative-strand templates are synthesized from discontinuous transcription on the plus-strand genome and serve as templates for mRNA synthesis. The full-length negativestrand template is made as a template for genomic RNA.

The antibodies effectively cross-neutralize infection by SARS pseudoviruses that bear S proteins of both homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV isolates, including the representative strains of human 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 SARS-CoV (Tor2 and GD03, respectively) and palm civet SARS-CoV (SZ3)71. Immunization of mice with RBD-Fc induces long-term protective immunity against challenge with homologous SARS-CoV BJ01 strain70,72. Administration of an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based vaccine that contains RBD (RBD-rAAV) by intramuscular and mucosal pathways elicits sufficient neutralizing antibodies to inhibit homologous SARS-CoV (GZ50) challenge in the established mouse model, and the immune responses can be enhanced by priming with RBD-rAAV and boosting with RBD-specific peptides73-75.The SARS-CoV S protein can also induce CD8 + T-cell responses. One H-2(b)-and one H-2 (d)-restricted T-cell epitope are mapped to RBD (S436-S443 and S366-S374, respectively) 24. Immunization of mice with a RBD-based subunit vaccine (S318-S510) elicits both antibody and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV26. The RBD of S protein contains multiple conformation-dependent epitopes and is the main domain that induces neutralizing antibody and T-cell immune responses against SARS-CoV infection76,77, making it an important target for vaccine development. The approaches for developing RBD-based vaccines against SARS-CoV have provided useful information for designing vaccines against other viruses with class I fusion proteins, as these proteins also contain RBDs in their S proteins.",
