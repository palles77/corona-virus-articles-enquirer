Unlike sw/Gent/08-and A/Vic/75-inoculated pigs, A/Wis/05-inoculated pigs lacked cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against sw/Gent/08 before challenge, but they showed a more rapid antibody response to sw/Gent/08 than challenge controls after challenge.

            "text": "The antigenic and genetic characteristics of swine influenza viruses (SIVs) vary in different continents and regions of the world, but most if not all H3N2 SIVs contain hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from early or more recent human H3N2 viruses. 1 In Europe, H3N2 SIVs are derived from descendants of the 1968 \"Hong Kong\" pandemic virus, but they have evolved further through genetic reassortment with the endemic avian-like H1N1 SIV in the mid-1980s. This has resulted in H3N2 SIVs with human-like HA and NA genes and avian-like internal genes. 2, 3 In North America, H3N2 viruses did not become established in the pig population until 1998. These viruses are \"triple\" reassortants with the HA, NA, and PB1 genes of human H3N2 viruses from the mid-1990s and the remaining genes of classical swine and avian origin. 4 Multiple H3N2 SIV lineages have been found in Asia, and all have HA and NA genes derived from human H3N2 viruses from various time periods. [5] [6] [7] Because of slower antigenic drift in the H3 HA in swine than in humans, 5, 8 human-lineage H3N2 viruses in swine over time become increasingly divergent from contemporary human H3N2 viruses. As an example, European H3N2 SIVs from 1983 to 1999 showed a six times slower rate of antigenic drift than their human counterparts. 8 Consequently, European H3N2 SIVs from recent years still show some degree of serological cross-reactivity with human viruses from the 1970s to 1980s, but not with human viruses isolated after 1990. 9, 10 Swine influenza viruses usually do not infect humans, but sporadic dead-end zoonotic infections have been reported with most SIV subtypes or lineages. [11] [12] [13] Such infections are generally mild and clinically indistinguishable from infections with human influenza viruses. Most cases of swine influenza occur in people with direct or indirect exposure to swine, frequently children, or young adults. The European H3N2 SIV has been isolated from a 1-year-old girl and a 2-year-old boy in the Netherlands in 1993. 14 A closely related virus was also isolated from a 10-month-old girl in Hong Kong in 1999. 15 In North America, nine cases of human infection with triple reassortant H3N2 SIV have been reported from 2005 to 2010. 12, 16, 17 A variant of the original triple reassortant H3N2 SIVs, which contains the matrix gene of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus, has been detected in 13 humans in the United States from July 2011 to April 2012, 18 and in 306 cases in 10 US states from July to September 2012, mainly in children visiting county or state fairs. 19 The increasing numbers of human cases may be in part due to heightened awareness and surveillance. No H3N2 SIV has so far shown the capacity to spread efficiently between humans.",

After acclimation for 1 week, three groups were inoculated with A/Vic/75, A/Wis/05, or sw/Gent/08, respectively. One group was left uninoculated and served as the challenge control group. Six weeks later, all groups were challenged with sw/Gent/08. All inoculations were performed intranasally with 7\u00c10 log 10 50% egg infective doses (EID 50 ) influenza virus in 3 ml (1\u00c15 ml per nostril) as described elsewhere. 26 Pigs were observed daily for clinical signs from 4 days before until 7 days after each inoculation, or until euthanasia. To determine virus excretion, nasal swabs were collected daily from all pigs from 0-7 days post-primary inoculation (dpi) and from 0-7 days post-challenge (dpc), or until euthanasia. Four pigs per group were euthanized at 3 dpc and gross lung lesions were assessed as described elsewhere. 27 To determine the extent of replication of the sw/ Gent/08 challenge virus in the respiratory tract, tissue samples of the upper (nasal mucosa respiratory part and olfactory part, tonsil, and trachea) and lower (apical, cardiac, and diaphragmatic lobes of the left and right lung) respiratory tract were collected and titrated separately. Blood samples for serological examinations were collected at the start of the experiment, 14 and 42 dpi, that is, at the time of challenge with sw/Gent/08.

The HA1 of A/Wis/05 contained as much as 64 aa differences compared with sw/Gent/08. Fourteen differences were located in antigenic sites: 2 in antigenic site A, 7 in B, 3 in C, 1 in D, and 1 in E. Three additional N-glycosylation sites in the globular head of HA1, at positions 133, 144, and 246, were found in A/Wis/05 but absent in A/Vic/75 and sw/Gent/ 08. Positions 133 and 144 were located in antigenic site A and position 133 was in the receptor binding site. The NA gene of A/Vic/75 was also more closely related to sw/Gent/08 (44 aa differences, with 10 in putative antigenic sites) than that of A/Wis/05 (62 aa differences, 15 in antigenic sites). Compared with sw/Gent/08, one additional N-glycosylation site was predicted for A/Vic/75 (position 234) and two for A/Wis/05 (positions 93 and 234). Table 2 compares the HA1 and NA protein sequences and presumed antigenic sites of sw/Gent/08 with those of additional human H3N2 viruses collected over time. The HA1 of sw/Gent/08 was most similar to that of A/Vic/75. Starting in 1989, all human strains showed less than 85% aa homology with the swine virus, and 14-17 aa differences in antigenic sites of the HA. N-glycosylation site 246 and 133 were consistently present in the globular head of the HA1 of all human H3N2 viruses examined since 1987 and 1997, respectively. The NA of sw/Gent/08 was most similar to that of A/Port Chalmers/1/73. Human viruses from 1989 or later showed <89% aa homology with the swine virus and 13-15 aa differences in antigenic sites of the NA. Table 3 shows the antigenic relationship in the HA and NA of the three viruses used in infection-challenge studies. Low to moderate cross-reactivity between A/Vic/75 and sw/ Gent/08 was observed in both HI and NI tests, whereas antisera against the two viruses lacked cross-reactivity with A/Wis/05 in both tests.

This is the first study to evaluate cross-protection between human and swine H3N2 viruses in pigs. It shows a complete virological protection against infection with a contemporary European H3N2 SIV in pigs infected with A/Vic/75 6 weeks earlier, but only a minimal protection in pigs pre-infected with the more recent human H3N2 virus A/Wis/05. We did not identify the immune mechanisms underlying the observed cross-protection, but several findings point toward a role for crossreactive antibodies against the HA and/or NA of the swine virus. Indeed, the difference in protective immune response induced by the two human viruses was in line with the genetic and antigenic differences in their HA and NA. Antigenic sites A and B are located on the tip of the HA molecule, and they are supposed to be the primary targets for neutralizing antibodies. 21, 22 A/Wis/05 differed from sw/Gent/ 08 in as much as seven of the total nine amino acids of site B, and it had two additional N-glycosylations in site A, which make it more distinct from sw/Gent/08 than A/Vic/75. In addition, low-titered cross-reactive VN antibodies against sw/Gent/08 were found in all pigs previously infected with A/ Vic/75, but they were rare after infection with A/Wis/05. Post-challenge, however, such antibodies developed more rapidly in A/Wis/05 pre-infected pigs than in challenge controls, and this coincided with the enhanced clearance of the challenge virus. The HI test, as well as the NI test, is less sensitive than the VN test. 26 This can explain the lack of cross-reactive HI and NI antibodies in most A/Vic/75inoculated pigs. Given the low cross-reactive serum antibody titers in A/Vic/75-inoculated pigs, it is likely that local antibodies in the respiratory tract and cell-mediated immunity, which are more cross-reactive, 31 also contribute to the cross-protection.",

The present comparison of sw/Gent/08 with human H3N2 viruses showed increased genetic differences since 1987-1989, as reflected by an increased number of aa differences in the HA ( ! 14) and NA ( ! 13), and additional N-glycosylations in the HA1 globular head. This suggests that especially people born after the mid-1980s are at a higher risk for infection with European H3N2 SIVs. Additional in vivo cross-protection studies with more, antigenically distinct human viruses would be required for a better understanding of the nature of the human viruses that could offer crossprotection against swine viruses. Still, genetic and antigenic analyses should be interpreted with caution. Our cross-NI test results with A/Wis/05 serum from ferrets versus swine, for example, illustrate that sera from different animal species may yield discrepant results. As for the definition of antigenic sites, this is based on studies of the oldest human viruses and their reaction with mouse monoclonal antibodies. It is questionable whether the antigenic sites of such historical viruses will overlap exactly with those of recent human or swine H3N2 viruses. Furthermore, different animal species will likely mount antibodies recognizing different epitopes. Finally, some amino acids will be more important for antigenic drift than others. According to recent studies, only 7 aa positions in the HA were largely responsible for the antigenic evolution of human H3N2 viruses over a period of 35 years. 32 It is of great interest to identify the immunodominant amino acids in the HA of SIVs and those that are cross-reactive with human H3N2 viruses.",

A/Wis/05 also seemed to replicate less efficiently in pigs than A/Vic/75, which is more closely related to swine-adapted H3N2 viruses. Similar findings were made in a comparative pig infection study with a triple reassortant H3N2 SIV from North America and a non-reassortant wholly human H3N2 virus. 33 Like the authors of that study, we suspect that the lower antibody responses to human influenza viruses in pigs are in part due to their lower replication efficiencies. Virus titers in the ferret model also differ for different H3N2 virus strains. 34, 35 Comparative studies of the pathogenesis of human and swine H3N2 viruses in pigs and ferrets would help to select the best animal models and experimental conditions for cross-protection studies with such viruses. On the other hand, a separate experiment in our laboratory has demonstrated complete protection against A/Wis/05 in pigs that had been previously infected with the homologous virus under the same conditions as in the present study, and with similar antibody titers. Thus, human H3N2 viruses can elicit an efficient protective immune response in pigs.",

Serological studies have shown crossreactive HI antibodies in ! 50% of late adolescents and young adults, whereas such antibodies were generally lacking in children under 10. 18,36,37 Overall, these serological findings and the present study support the idea that various H3N2 SIV lineages could cause epi-or pandemics in the younger population, should they acquire the capacity to spread efficiently between people.

Both serological investigation of humans and experimental cross-protection studies, as well as studies of the host barriers, are needed to further explore the susceptibility of humans to various H3N2 SIVs. Experimental cross-protection studies are performed under artificial conditions, but they will assess all arms of the immune response and true protection. Many serological studies only consider subjects with HI titers ! 40 as protected, and they may therefore underestimate protection against SIVs in the human population.",
