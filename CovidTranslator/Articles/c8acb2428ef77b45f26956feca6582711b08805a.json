Following intracerebral injection of a neurovirululent strain of influenza A virus into mice, the virus was found to be particularly localized in neurons of the substantia nigra and hippocampus. Although efforts to detect virus particles in the brains, or antibodies in the serum or CSF of patients with PD have been generally unsuccessful, recent immunohistochemical work has revealed the presence of complement proteins and the interferon-induced MxA in association with Lewy bodies and swollen neuronal processes. Although a viral etiology for PD is not now widely accepted, we proposed such an hypothesis. Neurovirulent influenza A virus is a candidate, but some other viruses or complex infection of these viruses may be responsible for the formation of Lewy bodies and the later death of nigral neurons.",

They suggested that, \"during the acute phase of infection, the influenza or similar virus may be carried in the circulation and can gain access to the nervous system. A virus within a neuron at any site within the nervous system may be either a whole or a defective virus. After a latent interval these may mutate to a form that may suppress macromolecular synthesis and cause degeneration of the neuron... the mutant gene and/or its product may then be transferred to adjacent neurons producing a continuous loss of interconnected neurons... the influenza A virus is a prime candidate because of its historical relationship with encephalitis lethalgica.\" Acute, often transitory parkinsonism has been reported during viral encephalitis. [lo] all reported post-infectious parkinsonism with nigral pathology, but they were not able to identify a particular virus. The case report by Lin et al. [lo] is particularly interesting. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan gave results similar to those in Parkinson's disease (PD), that is a decreased striatal [18F]fluorodopa uptake, particularly in the putamen, and a relative excess of D2 receptors. These data indicate that viruses may be pathogens capable of producing selective nigral pathology. One may speculate that certain asymptomatic virus infections might manifest as PD several years later by the processes described by Hudson and Rice [l] .",

            "text": "Encephalitis lethalgica is one example of a chronic disease where a form of parkinsonism results from a possible viral infection. Eighty percent of the patients afflicted with encephalitis lethalgica had chronic progressive parkinsonism. However, the pathology differs from that of PD in many respects. Similarities with Guamanian Parkinson-dementia complex and with progressive supranuclear palsy have been suggested 1111. The co-occurrence of encephalitis lethalgica and the 1918-1919 influenza epidemic led to speculation of a causal association between the two epidemics. The swine influenza virus (HlNl) was implicated as the most probable etiological agent for the influenza pandemic. Immunofluorescent staining showed antigens of the influenza A viral strains WSN and NWS in the brains of six cases of encephalitis lethalgica [7] . These antigens were seen in the nuclei of nerve cells in the hypothalamus and midbrain. Other than the influenza A virus, only coronaviruses in the MHV and HCV-OC43 antigenic group are suspected of producing chronic damage to the dopamineproducing neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) in humans [18] . Most epidemiological studies have failed to identify an intimate relationship between obvious exposure to a virus and I'D. However, two reports have strongly supported an infection with influenza as the cause of PD. An increased risk of developing idiopathic Parkinson's disease in individuals born during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic has been reported [12] . A case-control study evaluating risk factors for PD suggested that the frequency of severe flu-like illness was higher in the I'D group than in controls [13] . For several reasons, we have recently directed our work towards testing the hypothesis that the influenza A virus is important in the etiology of PD, and the relevant data will be the focus of this review.",

They have two principal surface antigens, haemagglutinin (HA) and a neuraminidase (N), which vary antigenically from strain to strain. The HA glycoprotein performs two crucial functions in the early phase of a virual infection. Haemagglutinin is responsible both for the binding of the virus to cell surface receptors and for mediating liberation of the viral genome into the cytoplasm through membrane fusion. The variations can involve major (shift) or minor (drift) alterations and HA and N vary independently.

Neurovirulence has also been reported for recombinant strains between WSN and A/ Aichi/ 2168 (H3N2) [22, 23] . The mechanism of the neurovirulence has been studied using mice. Infection of mice with these viruses by intracerebral inoculation caused a meningo-encephalitic condition [24] . Using various recombinants between the WSN and NWS strains, Nakajima and Sugiura [23] , and Sugiura and Ueda [22] clearly demonstrated that the WSN neuraminidase is the principal factor determining neurovirulence. The role of WSN neuraminidase has been considered to be the facilitation of the cleavage of the HA polypeptide. On the other hand, matrix protein (M) and probably nonstructural protein (NS) proteins play a role as helpers or accessory virulence factors, enabling efficient virus replication in the brain.",

Therefore, tropism of influenza A virus could be determined by the proteases of the host cells as well as the presence of the receptor (sialic acid), leading to a localized infection despite the widespread occurrence of the sialic acid. The blood-clotting factor Xa [25] and tryptase Clara [26] are two enzymes which have been identified as influenza virus-activating proteases.

The FXa localization on the apical surface of those tissues is of particular interest in view of the fact that some paraand orthomyxoviruses targeting these tissues require FXa-like endoproteinases for their ability to replicate and spread, and bud from the apical surface [25] . Furthermore, we observed positive immunolabelling in some brainstem neurons, such as in the SN, oculomotor nucleus, locus ceruleus and pontine nuclei. White matter microglial cells were also positive for FXa. Positive immunolabelling in some catecholamine neurons is particularly interesting with respect to influenza A infection.",

Recently, we also studied the clinical symptoms and the localization of neurovirulent influenza A virus in mice after intracerebral injection. We used four different strains of influenza A virus [A/WSN/33 (HlNl, WSN); A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2,Aicl-G) and two recombinants, R96; and R404BP. The detailed genotype of each virus has been described in our previous paper [33] 1. The gene derivations of these strains are presented in our recent paper. Each mouse received an intracerebral inoculation through a double-tapered needle of 30 ml of phosphate buffered saline containing 510 plaque forming units (PFU) of the virus to be tested. Immunohistochemistry with anti-WSN antibody (rabbit polyclonal, l:lO,OOO) was done. The virus strains with the WSN gene segment coding for neuraminidase (NA) induced meningo-encephalitis in the mice. The mice inoculated with the R96 strain, which has only the NA gene from the WSN strain, had mild symptoms and weakly positive immunoreactivity to the anti-WSN antibody in meningeal regions. Both the WSN and R404BP strains, which contain the WSN gene segments coding for both NA and matrix protein (M), were clearly neurovirulent both clinically and pathologically. On day 3 following inoculation with either of these strains, WSN-immunoreactivity was seen in meningeal and ependymal areas, neurons of the circumventricular regions, the cerebral and cerebellar cortices, the SN zona compacta (SNC) and the ventral tegmental area (Fig. ZA, B) . On day 7, meningeal reactions as well as neuronal staining was still seen, and advanced immunoreactivity was evident in the SNC (Fig. 2C, D, E) and hippocampus. Double immunostaining demonstrated that the WSN antigen was only seen in neurons and not in microglia or reactive astrocytes. Immunostaining for a lectin, maackia amurensis agglutinin that recognizes the Neu5Ac a2,3 Gal sequence which serves as a binding site for influenza A virus on target cell membranes, showed that positive immunoreactivity was localized to the ventral SN and hippocampus.",

In I'D, but not in controls, intra-and extraneuronal LBs and dendritic spheroid bodies were stained by anti-human C3d, C4d, C7 and C9 antibodies. However, we were not able to detect proteins of the alternative complement pathway such as fraction Bb of factor B or proper&din. Activation of the complement system is important in amplifying the proteolytic cascade, opsonizing tissue for phagocytosis and destroying invaders. The association of complement and its inhibitors with Alzheimer's disease lesions, and the presence of complement activated oligodendroglia [38] in some neurodegenerative disorders have been well described as characteristics of the central nervous system pathology. The complement cascade can be activated not only by immunoglobulins, but also by other factors such as trypsin-like enzymes, myelin or a virus. Our results on the association of complement proteins with LBs and dendritic spheroid bodies, the pathological characteristics of the nigral damage in ED [37] , suggest that classical complement activation may contribute to the nigral pathology. A virus may be one of the candidates for the activation of complement.",

It designates leukocyte IFNs as CX-IFN and w-IFN, fibroblast IFN as p-IFN, and immune IFN as y-IFN. Infection by various viruses activates the cr-IFN and P-IFN genes. It has been suggested that the production of (r-IFN in various tissues may be stimulated by factors other than viral infection and may have a role in normal physiology [41, 42] . In line with this suggestion, traces of CX-IFN have been demonstrated in the CSF of normal individuals [43] , and constitutive expression of &EN has been shown in normal human brains as well as in the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis [44] . Akiyama et al. [45] and Yamada et al. [39] reported CY-IFN immunoreactivity in neurons and microglia (Fig. 4A ) in human brain. Punctate staining of neurons was diffusely seen in cortical areas. This may have reflected non-specific binding of a-IFN to gangliosides in neuronal membranes [46, 47] .",

Various CX-IFN subspecies, as well as fl-IFN and w-IFN, but not T-IFN, can compete with each other for the same binding sites on human cells. After binding to the cell, IFN molecules are transported into the nucleus within a few minutes by facilitated receptor-mediated endocytosis [47] . Immunohistochemically, we recently showed that an a-IFN receptor ((r-IFNR) is localized to brain microglial cells (Fig. 4B) as well as to macrophages in infarct areas [40] . Soluble forms of the (r-IFNR protein (~40) were seen in plasma, consistent with a previous study [48] . Microglial localization of both a-IFNR and a-IFN suggest that (r-IFN may be coupled to receptors in postmortem human brain tissue. So far, however, we have not determined whether microglial cells produce ar-IFN in an autocrine fashion or not. In the SN tissues in PD patients, we could not find any structures other than microglia which stained with the antibodies to CY-IFN or its receptor. In the experimental mice with WSN intracerebral inoculations, IFN-positive microglia appeared in the areas of influenza A invasion. MxA (molecular mass of about 78 kDa) is an interferon-induced protein which is encoded by a gene located on the distal part of the long arm of human chromosome 21 [49] . In contrast to mouse Mxl protein, which accumulates in the nuclei of IFNtreated cells, tMxA accumulates in the cytoplasm [50] . MxA plays a role in defense against vesicular stomatitis virus, influenza virus and measles virus at a transcriptional [51] , post-transcriptional 1521 and translational level [53] , respectively. The Mx proteins found in several species all have sequence elements typical of a GTPase in the amino-terminal portion of the molecule [54, 551. The GTP binding core domain has been thought to be essential for anti-influenza A activity in the murine Mxl protein [56] .",

Although the mechanism for LBs fibrillogenesis remains unclear, the present study suggests that induction and aggregation of MxA protein may play some role in LB formation.",
