In addition, novel influenza viruses can unpredictably enter the human population, leading to global pandemics in the na\u00efve population. Vaccination is the cornerstone of public health programs to reduce seasonal and pandemic influenza morbidity and mortality. Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) are highly effective in preventing disease caused by circulating viruses carrying the neutralization epitopes present in the vaccine. However, circulating viruses can rapidly escape host immunity by undergoing antigenic change. To maintain their efficacy, the antigen composition of IIVs has to be updated frequently to include newly emerged antigenic variants. Most recently, this was illustrated by the dramatic emergence and global spread of swine-origin 2009 pandemic H1N1 (H1N1pdm) influenza virus.",

Similarly, adjuvanted vaccines are thought to elicit protection against antigenically divergent viruses (29, 33, 43, 49) . More recently, virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines against 1918 H1N1 influenza have elicited heterosubtypic anti-H5N1 immunity in mice and ferrets after intranasal, but not intramuscular (i.m.), administration (31) .",

Accumulated evidence on VLP vaccines suggests that they are efficient at stimulating both cellular and humoral immune responses. Previous studies of influenza VLP vaccines against both seasonal (5, 9, 36, 42) and potential pandemic viruses (7, 12, 18, 25, 26, 32, (44) (45) (46) 48) , delivered either intranasally or via conventional intramuscular immunization in mice, have demonstrated excellent immunogenicity and protection against viral challenge. As well as single-dose protection against the homologous (vaccine) viruses, in some cases influenza VLPs have also induced strong cross-protection against heterologous viruses (4, 5, 12, 34) , especially after intranasal delivery (31) . Several intranasal influenza VLP vaccines have been evaluated in humans with very promising results (reviewed in reference 40). The intranasal route for delivery of influenza vaccines offers a dual advantage by eliciting mucosal immunity and providing broader protection at the sites of virus entry. In addition, an intranasal vaccine may facilitate mass vaccination in cases of imminent pandemic threat.",

In contrast to HI titers, ferrets immunized with H1pdm VLPs or split vaccine did develop moderate levels of antibodies that cross-reacted with BR/59 in ELISA with whole-virus antigen (Fig. 2B) . In this assay, the split vaccine induced titers equivalent to i.n. VLPs and higher than i.m. VLPs, presumably because the split vaccine includes the neuraminidase (NA) antigen as well as HA and is therefore able to target more antigens in on March 19, 2020 by guest http://cvi.asm.org/ Downloaded from the whole-virus ELISA. However, no cross-reactive IgA response was detectable (Fig. 2C) . Protection against morbidity after homologous viral challenge. To assess the induction of protective immunity, vaccinated and na\u00efve control ferrets were challenged with 10 6 PFU of homologous NY/18 or heterologous BR/59 virus intranasally at 19 days after the booster vaccination (40 days after the initial vaccination). After challenge, all ferrets showed a trend toward a moderate increase of temperature for 2 to 4 days (Fig. 3A) . Nonimmunized ferrets lost approximately 10% of their body weight during the first 2 weeks after challenge, whereas ferrets vaccinated with VLPs (either i.n. or i.m.) showed only a transient and moderate weight loss (approximately 5% of body weight), recovering the lost weight rapidly (Fig. 3B) . Unexpectedly, the split vaccine conferred little protection against disease symptoms, as ferrets receiving this immunization lost weight to a similar extent as na\u00efve controls (Fig. 3B) . Results from homologous virus challenge suggest that VLP vaccines might provide better protection than the split vaccine, as evidenced by less body weight loss.",

VLPs have been investigated for many viruses, including hepatitis C virus, several retroviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and influenza virus A (13, 15, 20, 21, 28, 52 ; reviewed in reference 40). Previous experiments have demonstrated that VLPs containing influenza virus HA and NA are effective in preventing homologous and, in some cases, heterologous viral infections. The potential ease of use, safety, and immunogenicity of VLPs make them an attractive option for clinical use and could offer major advantages for mass vaccination in case of a pandemic. Intranasal (i.n.) vaccination has been demonstrated to induce a broader range of protection against lethal challenge (31) . In addition, i.n. vaccination is an attractive option clinically, because it avoids injection. Here, we tested the immunogenicity and protective (B) Ferret body weight was monitored daily (average body weights for each group \u03ee 1 SD, as a percentage of the body weight on day 0).

Vaccination of ferrets with VLPs containing only the M1 and HA proteins from H1N1pdm induced high antibody titers and conferred significant protection against homologous virus challenge. VLP-vaccinated animals lost less weight, shed less virus in nasal washes, and had markedly lower virus titers in all organs tested than na\u00efve controls. A single dose of VLPs, either i.m. or i.n., induced higher levels of antibody than did two doses of commercial split vaccine, although an antibody response to the split vaccine was detectable by HI and ELISA. This is especially remarkable in that ELISA titers (which can detect antibody responses against a wide range of viral antigens) as well as HI titers were higher with the VLPs, even though the split vaccine (which includes NA as well as HA) provided an additional antigen to be targeted by the antibody response. In fact, the broader response induced by the split vaccine was observed in ELISAs against heterologous virus, in which the split vaccine induced equal titers of antibodies as the i.n. VLPs and higher than the i.m. VLPs. In these assays, antibodies might have directed at more conserved regions of HA that do not neutralize the virus or prevent hemagglutination are detected, explaining the significant ELISA titers against heterologous virus that did not correspond to detectable HI titers.",

Although these animals had lower virus titers in olfactory bulbs, tonsils, and intestines, they lost weight and shed virus in nasal washes to a similar extent as na\u00efve controls. The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of H1N1pdm split vaccine have been previously demonstrated in mice (6, 53) and humans (6, 19, 22, 24, 30, 41) . In na\u00efve ferrets, however, the split vaccine was previously shown to be only weakly immunogenic and partially protective (2, 8) , consistent with our observations here. Humans vaccinated with H1N1pdm split vaccine are probably primed by previous exposure to seasonal viruses and therefore react more vigorously than na\u00efve ferrets. The challenge dose in the present experiments, at 10 6 PFU, may have been too high to be controlled by the modest level of antibody induced by the split vaccine. In any case, VLP vaccination by either the i.m. or i.n. route was capable of dramatically reducing viral replication and disease even at this challenge dose, reinforcing the superior immunogenicity of VLPs.",

(31) . We tested the ability of i.n. H1pdm VLPs to confer protection against challenge with the heterologous seasonal H1N1 influenza virus BR/59. Despite high titers of antibodies against homologous viruses by both HI and ELISAs and moderate ELISA titers against the heterologous virus, no antibody was detected in HI assays, indicating that the antibody response against heterologous virus was directed at conserved regions of HA and is not capable of blocking binding of the HA to its receptors. Consistent with this, the VLPs conferred little or no cross-protection to the challenge virus, as revealed by the lack of reduction in nasal wash virus titers, similar virus titers in organs, and lack of protection against disease, as indicated by similar levels of weight loss.",

            "text": "In a previous study with CA/04 VLPs, mice did develop partial cross-protection against a different heterologous virus, PR8 (37) . One possibility is that mice are more readily protected against influenza virus infection, even with minimal levels of cross-reactive immune responses. For example, partial cross-protection was observed in mice where antibody titers reactive to heterologous virus were lower by more than 10-fold compared to those reactive to the homologous virus (37) . It is likely that protective immunity is more difficult to achieve in ferrets, which (like humans) are intrinsically more susceptible to influenza virus than are mice. As well, the HA of the heterologous challenge virus used in this study, BR/59, is not as closely related to that of the CA/07 virus as is the PR8 challenge virus used previously (37) , making cross-protection more difficult to achieve. Indeed, lack of cross-protective immunity (even after infection with wild-type viruses) between H1N1 viruses such as BR/59 and the H1N1pdm viruses may explain the rapid global spread of the H1N1pdm virus. Even though the VLPs delivered i.n. were more immunogenic than the split vaccine and did induce cross-reactive antibodies, apparently most of those antibodies lacked critical protective functions. Further study is necessary to fully understand the extent of cross-protective immunity by VLPs and other vaccines and to identify vaccination methods of consistently inducing broadly protective immune responses.",
