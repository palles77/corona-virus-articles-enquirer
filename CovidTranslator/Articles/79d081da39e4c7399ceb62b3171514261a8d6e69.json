In this study, we replaced either the entire or partial p7 of genotype 2a (strain JFH1), an HCV strain that replicates and produces virus progeny in vitro, with the corresponding regions of the p7 protein from genotype 1b (Australian isolate, HCV-A). Compared to wild type, the chimeric viruses reached their peak of infectivity with a delay but they produced a comparable titer to the wild type virus and the progeny viruses were able to infect naive permissive cells. Amantadine treatment of wild type and chimeric viruses reduced the virus titers by about 50% and 45%, respectively. Therefore, in this study, for the first time, we demonstrated that genotype 2a (JFH1 strain) genome encoding a full-length genotype 1b p7 gene produces infectious particles in vitro. These chimeric viruses are valuable instruments for comparative studies of the p7 proteins.",

            "text": "HCV is classified in the family Flaviviridae, genus Hepacivirus and is a small enveloped virus with a positive-sense single stranded RNA genome. The genome encodes a polyprotein that is co-and post-translationally cleaved into at least 10 structural and nonstructural (NS) viral proteins (Fields et al., 1996) . One of these, the p7 protein, is a small, membrane-associated protein of 63 amino acids that is located at the junction of the structural and NS proteins (Lin et al., 1994) . Thus far, it has not been determined if the p7 protein is a structural or an NS protein. The protein is comprised of two tails located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), two hydrophobic transmembrane \u03b1-helices, TM1 and TM2, and an intervening basic loop located in the cytoplasm (Carrere-Kremer et al., 2002) . Using plasmid expression vectors, p7 has been shown to be mainly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (Carrere-Kremer et al., 2002; Griffin et al., 2005) and possibly in mitochondrial membranes while a small percentage of the over-expressed p7 protein was detected in the plasma membrane (Griffin et al., 2004) . However, we have recently shown that p7 is localized to the ER, not mitochondria, in cells transfected with a replication-competent recombinant genome of the JFH1 strain of HCV (Haqshenas et al., in press ).",

Similar to that which has been shown for other viral ion channel forming proteins like the influenza virus proteins, M2 (Duff and Ashley, 1992; Duff et al., 1994; Pinto et al., 1992) , BM2 (Mould et al., 2003) , and NB (Sunstrom et al., 1996) , HIV proteins Vpu and Vpr (Piller et al., 1996) , alphavirus 6K protein (Melton et al., 2002) , Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) E protein , GBV-B p7 (Premkumar et al., 2006) and Dengue virus M protein (Premkumar et al., 2005) , the p7 protein seems to have an essential role in the HCV life cycle. In an in vivo study, p7 was shown to be essential for HCV replication as viral RNA with the p7 region deleted or mutated was non-infectious in chimpanzees (Sakai et al., 2003) . However, p7 is dispensable for viral RNA replication as replicons which lack the p7 gene replicate efficiently (Blight et al., 2000; Lohmann et al., 1999) . Therefore, it is concluded that p7 is not required for efficient HCV genome replication, but is essential for the production of infectious virions (Sakai et al., 2003) .",

The p7 protein, as an ion channel forming protein, is a potential target for ion channel inhibitors. p7 ion channel activity in planar lipid bilayers is inhibited by hexamethylene amiloride (Premkumar et al., 2004) , long-alkyl-chain iminosugar derivatives (Pavlovic et al., 2003) and amantadine, which also inhibited p7 activity in an hemadsorption assay (Griffin et al., 2003; Griffin et al., 2004) . In clinical trials, amantadine has been shown to significantly increase the number of HCV-infected patients who showed a sustained virological response (Berg et al., 2003; Deltenre et al., 2004; Mangia et al., 2004) while other data have not supported these findings (Thuluvath et al., 2004) . These contrasting findings may be a reflection of amantadine resistance of the ion channel function of p7 found in some HCV strains (Steinmann et al., 2005) .",

In the case of the chimeric genomes, the virus titer declined slightly in passage 2 but increased in passage 3-4 and remained at this level until the end of the experiment (Fig. 5A ). The chimeric viruses did not reach the peak titer of wild type at any time point showing that the chimera replicated with slower kinetics than the wild type. The maximum titers of the wild type JFH1, P-p7 and F-p7 that were achieved in this study were 7.4 \u00d7 10 7 , 3.6 \u00d7 10 7 and 3.5 \u00d7 10 7 viral RNA copies/ml, respectively. The specific infectivity of the wild type and F-p7 was calculated as 2900 and 1600 RNA copies per FFU, respectively. We also determined the infectivity titers of the wild type and the chimeric viruses of the supernatants up to passage 6 posttransfection. Consistent with the results from the viral RNA titers, the wild type virus reached its peak in early passages while Pp7 and Fp7 chimeras reached their highest infectivity titers at passage 3 and 5, respectively (Fig. 5B ).

            "text": "p7 protein is a small protein of HCV that is highly membrane associated. The protein is comprised of two lumenal tails, two TM domains with an intervening cytosolic loop. The lumenal tails at the N-and C-termini of the protein were previously reported to contain genotype-specific sequences since the chimeric 1a/2a virus was infectious only when the lumenal tail sequences of the backbone genome of genotype 1a were left unaltered in the chimeric genome (Sakai et al., 2003) . Differences in the amino acids of the N-terminal lumenal tails of genotype 1a (H77C) and genotype 2a (J6) p7 proteins are restricted to positions 4 and 9. In H77C, there are two polar amino acids of asparagines at positions 4 and 9 while in J6 there are two charged amino acids of lysine and histidine at the corresponding positions (Sakai et al., 2003) . The J4 p7, like the HCV-A.p7, contains two asparagines at positions 4 and 9 while JFH-1 p7, like J6 p7, contains a lysine and a histidine residue at the corresponding positions, respectively. Moreover, the differences between JFH1 and HCV-A in the C-terminal lumenal tail are greater than the differences between J6 and H77C (Sakai et al., 2003) . Nevertheless, in the present study, despite these differences, the full-length JFH1/HCV-A.p7 chimera was infectious and produced infectious particles. This might reflect the difference between an in vivo and an in vitro system to examine the chimeric HCV genomes. To further examine the possibility of the existence of genotype-specific sequences in the lumenal tails, the chimeric 1a/2a genomes can now be examined in an in vitro assay since a cell culture system is now available to grow genotype 1a and its chimeric viruses (Yi et al., 2006) . In this study, although the chimeric genomes produced infectious viruses with comparable titers to wild type, compared to the wild type, the chimeric viruses reached their peak of infectivity with a delay. Sequencing analysis of the insert regions did not reveal any compensatory mutation in the p7 and flanking regions. Moreover, the immunoblot analysis did not demonstrate a major difference in the processing of the E2-p7-NS2 precursor proteins of the wild type and chimeras following either transfection or infection. However, it is likely that a compensatory mutation occurred in the viral genome, outside of the p7 and flanking regions, which made the chimeric viruses more replication-competent.",

            "text": "Until recently, HCV studies were hindered by the lack of a robust cell culture system to grow the virus in vitro. Recently, Wakita et al. (2005) during the preparation of this manuscript, chimeric JFH1 viruses encoding the genotype 1a, 1b and 3a structural proteins, p7 and partial NS2 were also constructed Pietschmann et al., 2006) . Despite the importance of these reports, the lack of a cell culture system to support the replication of all the HCV genotypes remains a major obstacle to study different HCV genotypes and develop antiviral drugs that are effective against all genotypes. Moreover, in the current cell culture systems, it is very difficult to justify the specific effects of any ion channel inhibitors on the function of p7 protein. Therefore, in the present study, based on the JFH1 strain, we generated two novel chimeric viruses that encode only the genotype 1b p7 gene to facilitate the comparative study of the ion channel activity of the genotype 1 and 2 p7 proteins since genotype 1 is responsible for a high proportion of HCV-infected patients in most geographic areas. In most Asian countries, genotype 1b is predominant while in the United States and Europe genotype 1a and 1b are predominant (Bukh et al., 1995; Lau et al., 1996) . The ion channel activity of genotype 1b p7 protein (Yanagi et al., 1998) has been shown to be sensitive to amantadine (Griffin et al., 2004) . The amino acid sequence of the J4 isolate only differs in two amino acid positions to the HCV-A p7: one in the cytosolic loop and one in TM2 (Fig. 9 ). Using computer modeling and electron microscopy, it has been proposed that only TM1, but not TM2, is involved in ion channel formation (Carrere-Kremer et al., 2002; Griffin et al., 2003; Patargias et al., 2006) . We have also examined the Nterminal subunit of p7 for ion channel activity and confirmed the previous reports by showing that the N-terminal subunit of p7 per se, independent from the C-terminal subunit, forms ion channel in an artificial lipid bilayer (unpublished data). Furthermore, J4 p7 has been shown to be sensitive to amantadine in an artificial lipid bilayer and also in an in vitro system (Griffin et al., 2003; Griffin et al., 2004) . Computer modeling of the p7 protein of J4 strain demonstrated that amantadine resides within the pore, formed by oligomerization of TM1, in the vicinity of His-17 and interacts with Ser-21 via hydrogen bonding (Patargias et al., 2006) . Therefore, we examined the sensitivity of the full-length chimeric virus, containing an identical Nterminal subunit to the J4 strain p7 protein, for sensitivity to amantadine. This study demonstrated that amantadine has a similar effect on the life cycles of the chimeric (encoding the full- Fig. 7 . The p7 proteins in the chimeric viruses are stable. (A) The RNA was extracted from passage 4 of the wild type and the chimeric viruses containing partial p7 (Pp7) and the entire p7 (Fp7) proteins and subjected to RT-PCR amplification. The PCR products were visualized in a 1% agarose gel. (B and C) The PCR products were then sequenced, and the depicted amino acid sequences have been shown. length HCV-A.p7) and wild type viruses as determined by the titer of the virus secreted into the supernatant. However, a much larger reduction in the titer of the chimeric virus was expected, due to the previous published data (see above). We also demonstrated that the ion channel activity of the HCV-A (genotype 1b) p7 protein was resistant to amantadine in artificial lipid bilayers. The discrepancy between our results on HCV-A (genotype 1b) and the published data on J4 p7 (genotype 1b) may suggest a role for the cytosolic loop and TM2 in the response to amantadine. To examine this, we are currently in the process of changing the two amino acids to convert HCV-A.p7 to J4 p7. Although the results of the amantadine effect on JFH1 wild type are in contrast to previously published data (Steinmann et al., 2005) , they are in agreement with the more recently published data showing that amantadine reduced the number of JFH1 foci by about 70% in cell culture (Boume et al., 2005) . The mechanism of the effect of amantadine on the HCV life cycle is not clear yet. However, the results presented in this manuscript suggest that this mechanism is far more complex than simply blocking ion channel pores. It has been documented that the infection of cells with porcine circovirus type 2 that does not contain any ion channel forming protein is inhibited by amantadine through inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Nauwynck et al., 1999) . HCV, like porcine circovirus type 2, enters the cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Blanchard et al., 2006) and, therefore, the effect of amantadine on the HCV life cycle might partially be through the blocking of this function. Collectively, because the only difference between the wild type and the chimera is the p7 protein and irrespective of the sensitivity of p7 to amantadine, the drug has almost the same effect on the viral life cycle, it is possible that this effect is not through the inhibition of p7 protein.",
