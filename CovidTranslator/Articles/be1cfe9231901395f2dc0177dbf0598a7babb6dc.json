In the Chinese population, suicides constitute one-fifth of all recorded suicides in the world. Despite the factual data on suicide rates, the understanding of various causal factors behind suicide, including risk and protective factors and adverse health care, remained incomplete among the global Chinese aging population. To fill in the knowledge void, this paper reviews the epidemiology of suicide among Chinese older adults globally as well as explores the existing intervention strategies. Using the PRISMA statement, we performed a systematic review of exiting research on the topic, including studies describing suicide among Chinese older adults in communities outside of Asia. A literature search was conducted online by using both medical and social science data-bases. Our findings highlighted that elderly suicide in Chinese populations is significantly affected by the social, cultural, and familial contexts within which the individual lived prior to committing suicide. Reviewing such research indicated that while reducing risk factors may contribute to lowering suicides amongst Chinese older adults, measures to improve protective factors are also critical. Support through ongoing family and community care relationships is necessary to improve resilience in older adults and positive aging. Future longitudinal studies on the risk factors and protective factors, and adverse health consequences are called for to devise culturally and linguistically appropriate prevention and intervention programs in global Chinese aging populations.",

Despite the factual data on suicide rates, the understanding of various causal factors behind suicide, including risk and protective factors and adverse health care, remained incomplete. In the U.S., Chinese older immigrants have been identified as an underserved group with low acculturation level and high cultural and social isolation. Prior studies suggest that there are significant health disparities among Chinese persons, including chronic diseases, cancer screening and treatment, and psychological distress after having relocated and losing contact with their native support network [5] . In addition, Chinese immigrants experience more pronounced migratory and psychosocial distress, which is further exacerbated by the vast cultural and linguistic barriers, as well as physical frailty and stressful life events [6] . The psychological distress experienced by this population imposes significant health related consequences, and further impedes the quality-of-life of Chinese older adults.",

Research also shows that the urban/rural divide poses as a risk factor for suicide; those living in Northern China and in rural areas were found to be at a higher risk of suicide [9] . In addition, social status was found to predispose individuals to a greater risk of suicide and lower education was suggested to increase the risk of suicide. Furthermore, financial constraint is evidenced as a main influencing factor for suicidal ideation and behavior [10] .",

However, due to the large population size and limited man power, its effectiveness remains to be seen. The Hong Kong SAR has taken an alternate approach through the Opportunities for the Elderly Project (OEP). Reaching out to older adults with high risks of suicide through early detection and screening, OEP fosters a sense of community to care for the elderly population [26] . Another government-funded multifaceted model including treatment of depression, gatekeeper training, aftercare for suicide attempters, and care management also shows evidence of reducing suicide rates of completed suicide in old-age suicide attempters [27] .",

First, with respect to age distribution in China, high incidence of older adult suicides is dissonant to important Chinese traditional values of filial obligations of respect for older adults. Confucian philosophy has strongly influenced Chinese lifestyle and social interaction for thousands of years. However, in the face of rapid industrialization, modernization and social-cultural changes brought about by economic reforms, family structures and support may undergo significant transformations, potentially resulting in older adults perceiving insufficient filial support and care. Whereas stressful life events including family conflicts were found to be an important risk factor to suicide, the importance of familial integration cannot be overemphasized. Providing a sense of community and social support to the vulnerable older adult may serve as a buffer against suicide risks.",

Effects of economic reform, poverty, cultural changes and the one-child policy may all contribute to the phenomenon.",

It was reported that more than 80% of Chinese older adults were foreign born and more than 30% of Chinese older adults immigrated after the age of 60. Suffering from the loss of tradition, lack of acculturation and aging, the older Chinese population in the U.S. often lives in isolation, far away from their families in China. Hindered by cultural and language barriers, they experienced much difficulty in communication with others, let alone the ability to seek help. Therefore, it was not surprising that studies suggested that older Chinese immigrants have poorer quality of life than the national norms [30] . Other studies also pointed out that the prevalence of depressive symptoms among Chinese older adults was higher than that of general aging population in North America [31] . Coupled with the increasing social stressors and culturally valued imperatives of maintaining personal honor, older adults may consider themselves as \"burden\" to their families, and thus opt to suicide as means to resolve conflict.",

Early detection and prevention of elder suicide is necessary. In addition, mental health and health professionals at the front line should consider outreach programs that are particularly designed to increase familial, social, and community support for vulnerable older adults. Medical professionals should also consider screening older patients for suicidal risk factors by integrating questions on suicidal thoughts into routine medical history questions for older adults.",
