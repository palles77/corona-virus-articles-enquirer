The objective of this study was to examine the effect of atopy on the course of disease in children hospitalised with viral pneumonia. Methods: Children between the ages of 1 and 6 years hospitalised due to viral pneumonia between the years of 2013 and 2016 were included to this multicentre study. Patients were classified into two groups as mild---moderate and severe according to the course of pneumonia. Presence of atopy was evaluated with skin prick tests. Groups were compared to evaluate the risk factors associated with severe viral pneumonia. Results: A total of 280 patients from nine centres were included in the study. Of these patients, 163 (58.2%) were male. Respiratory syncytial virus (29.7%), Influenza A (20.5%), rhinovirus (18.9%), adenovirus (10%), human metapneumovirus (8%), parainfluenza (5.2%), coronavirus (6%), and bocavirus (1.6%) were isolated from respiratory samples. Eighty-five (30.4%) children had severe pneumonia. Atopic sensitisation was found in 21.4% of the patients. Ever wheezing (RR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1---2.4), parental asthma (RR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1---2.2), other allergic diseases in the family (RR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2---2.9) and environmental tobacco smoke (RR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1---3.5) were more common in the severe pneumonia group.",

Attention has been drawn in many studies to decreased antiviral response in patients with asthma. 1 Epithelium damage, disrupted epithelium repair mechanisms, inflammation and insufficient immune response that occur in asthma cause these patients to become more sensitive to airway irritants as well as viral infections. 2 Atopy, which refers to the genetic tendency to develop allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, asthma and atopic dermatitis and viral infections, disrupts the integrity of the epithelium barrier by way of synergic effect on the respiratory tract. This damage on the respiratory epithelium causes the onset of inflammation, thus triggering wheezing episodes and asthma. 1,3---5 Inflammation in the respiratory tract due to atopy in addition to the disruption of the epithelial barrier integrity places these patients under risks of severe viral lower respiratory tract infections.",

Both viral illness and allergic sensitisation/exposure increase risks of severe respiratory tract diseases that require hospitalisation. 12 The objective of this study was to examine the effects of the presence of atopy on the course of disease in children hospitalised with viral pneumonia.

Quantitative data were expressed in the tables as mean \u00b1 sd (standard deviation), median \u00b1 IQR (Interquartile Range) and as median Range (Maximum---Minimum) values.

The risk of developing asthma increases as a result of this sensitivity to allergens. 21, 22 It has been shown in studies that the exposure of lung epithelium to allergens with proteolytic activity such as house-dust mite, pollen, mould and fungi causes an increase in epithelium permeability by separating the tight junction regions between the epithelium cells. 23 All respiratory tract viruses enter from the airway epithelium, replicate in the airway epithelium thus damaging both ciliated and non-ciliated respiratory tract epithelium cells. As a result, they cause necrosis, ciliostasis, loss of cilia and decrease in mucociliary clearance in the airway epithelium. 24, 25 Both atopy and viral infections cause loss of integrity in the epithelium barrier, which has a vital importance due to its synergic effect on the respiratory tract. 1, 4 Forty-two percent of children who were hospitalised in intensive care units during the 2009---2010 pandemic influenza epidemic had asthma/atopic sensitisation, and H1N1-related severe respiratory tract infections were more common in atopic children in comparison with non-atopic children. 6 In another study carried out during the same year, of the 33 children who had an asthma attack during the pandemic influenza epidemic, 66.7% had had an asthma attack before but had not received a protective treatment for asthma, whereas 31.8% had their first asthma attack. Severe asthma attack, pneumonia and atelectasis develop more easily in atopic patients. 8 However, no such difference has been determined in seasonal influenza. 6, 8 In our study the presence of atopy by a skin prick test was not a risk factor for severe viral pneumonia. However, we showed that ever wheezing and parental asthma, which are related with atopic structure, were associated with severe of pneumonia. When volunteers are subject to in vivo RV inoculation, those with asthma have more severe symptoms in comparison with the controls. 26 Experimental RV studies show that allergic sensitisation and exposure to allergens are related with increase in the severity of RV related lower respiratory tract infections and asthma exacerbations. 1 Ducharme, FM et al. 27 showed that almost in two-thirds of patients, predominantly pre-schoolers (those aged six years or older), viruses have been detected in their nasopharyngeal secretions, mainly RV and RSV. In our study, influenza (29.2%) and RV (25%) pneumonias were more frequent in atopic children, which supports the previous findings.",

Lazzerini et al. 34 showed that pneumonia related fatality rates increase in cases with malnutrition. A study by Jroundi et al. 33 supported these findings showing that prognosis is worse in children with weight-for-age Z score <1SD. Ahanchian et al. 13 pointed out that nutritional support will decrease the recurrence of lower respiratory tract infections in children. Jroundi et al. 33 studied 689 children with pneumonia and showed that cyanosis, paleness, prematurity and passive smoking were risk factors for worse prognosis, while ever wheezing or asthma story were not. Jackson et al. 35 reported that low birth weight, lack of exclusive breastfeeding, crowding ---more than seven persons per household, exposure to indoor air pollution, incomplete immunisation, undernutrition ---weight-for-age less than two standard deviations and HIV infection were risk factors for severe pneumonia in children aged five years and below. A direct relationship could not be shown between the presence of atopy and severe pneumonia in our study, however the presence of ever wheezing, allergic disease story and parental asthma were associated with worse pneumonia. Camara et al. 36 carried out a study on children aged under 12 and reported that atopy history in the family for children under the age of two and the inhalant allergen sensitivity for children above the age of two were risk factors for viral respiratory tract infections. These findings are in accordance with our study. Kusel et al. 37 evaluated children aged six months, two, five and ten years old who had severe viral respiratory tract infections with regard to atopy. While the rate of atopy was not increased at two years of age, it increased by 2.56 between the ages of 2---5 and by 17.14 times at the age of ten. This relationship was observed in cases who had severe RSV infection at an early age.",
