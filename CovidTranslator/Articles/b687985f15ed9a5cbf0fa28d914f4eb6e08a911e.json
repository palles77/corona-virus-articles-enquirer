This condition may be caused by trauma or underlying lung disease, but sometimes happens spontaneously without obvious cause. When a pneumothorax develops, there is loss of the negative intrapleural pressure that is needed for lung inflation, and the lung on the affected side collapses and cannot expand properly. This collapse leads to a ventilation-perfusion mismatch because there is continued perfusion of a poorly ventilated lung. Arterial hypoxemia can occur with 50% collapse of the lung. If there is a continued air leak with increasing positive intrapleural pressure, this can lead to a tension pneumothorax and can lead to compromise of venous return to the heart, decreasing cardiac output, and causing hemodynamic collapse.",

On physical examination, patients typically have decreased breath sounds, decreased chest excursions, and hyperresonant percussion on the affected side. Subcutaneous emphysema may also be present. If the patient has any hemodynamic instability, the concern for a tension pneumothorax must be raised. Additional signs of a tension pneumothorax include significant respiratory distress, tachypnea, distended neck veins, pulsus paradoxus, displacement of the point of maximal cardiac impulse, and trachea shift. These signs are often late and emergency treatment must be initiated with an urgent thoracostomy tube or temporary decompression of the chest with a 14-to 16-gauge needle or catheter placed in the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line on the affected side.",

A white visceral pleural line can be seen outlining the collapsed lung border (Fig. 1) . Lateral displacement of the mediastinum and/or trachea and downward displacement of the diaphragm can be seen with a tension pneumothorax. According to the British Thoracic Society guidelines, a pneumothorax is defined as small if the distance from the chest wall to the visceral pleural line is less than 2 cm, or large if the distance is greater than 2 cm. 4 However, the American College of Chest Physicians defines small pneumothoraces as those in which the visceral pleura is less than 3 cm from the chest wall and large pneumothoraces as those more than 3 cm. 3 The chest cavity is a three-dimensional space and it is difficult to accurately calculate the size of the pneumothorax using plain chest films. It has van Berkel et al been estimated that, if the pneumothorax is 1 cm wide, it accounts for 25% of the hemithorax volume. A 2-cm pneumothorax can occupy up to 50% of the chest cavity. In patients with COPD, a large apical bulla can be misdiagnosed as a pneumothorax because of a similar appearance on chest radiograph. Chest computed tomography (CT) can help differentiate between these two conditions and provide information on underlying lung pathology. A large left-sided pneumothorax may lead to a right-sided shift in the QRS axis on an electrocardiogram, with a decrease in the precordial R wave voltage. In general, once the pneumothorax is treated, the electrocardiogram reading will return to normal. 7",

Two recent randomized controlled studies have been conducted evaluating needle aspiration versus chest tube insertion. One study consisted of 60 participants with either a first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, or a pneumothorax greater than 20%. The patients were randomized into one of 2 treatment groups: manual pleural aspiration with a small-caliber 16-gauge intravenous catheter under local anesthesia, or chest tube drainage with a 16 to 20 French chest tube. Patients with underlying lung disease, previous pneumothorax, or tension pneumothorax were excluded from the study. The results showed no difference in the immediate success rate, early failure rate, 1-year success rate, or complication rate of simple aspiration versus intercostal tube drainage. Simple aspiration had an immediate success rate of 60%, and resulted in a significant reduction in the proportion of patients hospitalized compared with intercostal tube drainage. 10 The second study enrolled 137 patients with a first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax at a single center. Patients were included if they were symptomatic or had greater than a 20% pneumothorax. Once again, patients were randomized to simple aspiration versus tube thoracostomy. The results showed no difference in immediate success rate, 1-week success rate, complication rate, recurrence at 3-month follow-up, or recurrence at 1 and 2 years. Only 26% of the patients treated with simple aspiration required hospital admission, versus 100% of those receiving chest tubes. 11 A Cochrane Review of this topic concurred with the British Thoracic Surgery guidelines recommending simple aspiration as a first-line treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothoraces requiring intervention. 4, 12 Conventional tube thoracostomy should be used in patients with large pneumothoraces who fail needle aspiration, who have underlying lung pathology, or who are very symptomatic. Chest tubes are inserted in the anterior or midaxillary line in the fourth or fifth interspace and should be guided posteriorly and cephalad. This tube positioning allows drainage of both fluid and air. If the patient has an isolated pneumothorax with no pleural effusion, a small chest tube (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) can be used to minimize discomfort to the patient. With proper tube drainage, the lung should re-expand rapidly. Negative pressure (\u00c010 to \u00c020 cm H 2 O) on the chest tube or underwater seal can be used to maintain lung re-expansion. The chest tube can be removed after the air leak has stopped. If the air leak is prolonged and the patient can maintain full lung expansion on underwater seal drainage, a 1-way valve can be placed at the end of the tube and the patient discharged and followed as an outpatient.",

Even if no abnormalities were found in the lung, resection of the apex decreased the recurrence rate. 18 It is important to combine a resection with a technique that locally fuses the pleural space to reduce the recurrence rate. This fusion can be achieved by pleurectomy, pleural abrasion, or pleurodesis. All these methods create an inflammatory reaction causing the lung to adhere to the chest wall, thus precluding collapse of the lung in the event of another parenchymal air leak. Thus, the procedure does not prevent an air leak from occurring; instead it is aimed at preventing a significant pneumothorax from developing. When used alone, the recurrence rate after pleurectomy is 1% to 5%. 19 Pleural abrasion is technically easier and is associated with fewer hemorrhagic complications than pleurectomy. In a review of 9 case series, the recurrence rate of pneumothorax after pleural abrasion alone was 2.3%. 20 Chemical pleurodesis can be used at the time of surgery, or via a chest tube in patients who are not candidates for surgical intervention. Talc is most often used for chemical pleurodesis, but autologous blood, bleomycin, tetracycline, and doxycycline have all been used. 21, 22 Talc is a powder of hydrous magnesium silicate and is extremely effective in inducing pleural adhesions. Talc pleurodesis is effective, with recurrence rates of 5% to 8% when patients are treated with talc pleurodesis alone. 23, 24 However, it induces fever and pain and, in up to 2% of patients, the associated pneumonitis can induce respiratory failure. 25 In addition, there is concern about the long-term consequences of leaving foreign material (talc crystals) in the chest cavity in young patients. Intrapleural injection of tetracycline alone is less effective and has been associated with recurrence rates of 16%. 26 Injection of tetracycline or doxycycline can be painful and it is important to premedicate patients with analgesics. Intrapleural lidocaine injection can be added to help with analgesia.",

In an additional longitudinal study, Ohta and colleagues 39 followed 25 patients having bullectomy for 4 years. They identified 20 patients with durable improvement in symptoms, and 5 patients whose symptoms worsened after 1 year. Only a higher initial FEV 1 and a uniform distribution of ventilation were able to predict the sustained postoperative improvement. 39 It is difficult to determine whether a patient's reduced FEV 1 is secondary to the presence of the bulla or to the emphysema in the underlying lung. This distinction is important, because performing a giant bullectomy on a patient with substantial underlying emphysema has been associated with higher morbidity and mortality, 40, 41 as well as less-durable benefit. 38 Using CT lung density measurements, Gould and colleagues 42 found that pulmonary function testing correlates poorly with the degree of bullous change, but is strongly related to the degree of emphysema in the underlying lung. Haerens and colleagues 43 reported on 15 patients having bullectomy, 10 of whom had generalized emphysema and 5 who had normal underlying lung. Preoperatively, the FEV 1 of the patients with normal underlying lung was higher, but, on an individual patient basis, it was impossible to predict the quality of the underlying lung based solely on pulmonary function testing. 43 A reduction in diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide in the lung (DLCO) has been noted as an indicator of underlying emphysema, 44, 45 and patients with normal DLCO have been found to have better short-and long-term outcomes after bullae resection. 38, 46, 47 However, reversible conditions leading to extreme airway obstruction can give falsely depressed DLCO levels; as such, a low DLCO should not be the sole reason for denying a patient an operation.",

The wall of the bulla is folded over and used as a staple line buttress, and a linear stapler is fired completely across the base of the bulla. At completion, all raw surfaces are sealed, and the buttressed staple line consists of 4 layers of parietal pleura and bulla wall. 58 Alternatively, a giant bulla can be excised without widely opening the bulla. The bulla is deflated by making a small incision the lateral wall, which is grasped and held up with Allis clamps, and sequential firings of a linear stapler are applied.

As with open bullectomy, care must be taken when entering the pleura to avoid injuring the underlying lung, and a complete adhesiolysis is needed to visualize the bulla to be resected. The bulla can be partially opened to obtain adequate visualization. Once the bulla is identified, a stapled bullectomy can be performed with sequential firings of a buttressed endoscopic stapler, in a manner similar to the open bullectomy. [59] [60] [61] [62] The underlying lung is reinflated under direct vision; if the underlying lung does not reinflate, bronchoscopy should be performed to suction clean the involved airways. When there has been chronic collapse of a section of lung, it can sometimes be difficult to re-expand. Typically, the airway pressure necessary to inflate the collapsed segment is high and, as a consequence, the abnormally compliant diseased lung is preferentially inflated. If this occurs, it can be useful to pass a small catheter through the working port of the bronchoscope and apply gentle jet ventilation to the airway leading to the collapsed lung segment.",

A segment of rib is resected, and the parietal pleura adjacent to the bulla is incised. An incision is made on the lateral wall of the bulla, and any septae in the interior of the bulla are excised. Two purse-string sutures are placed around the hole in the bulla, and a 32 French Foley catheter is inserted into the bulla to serve as an endocavitary drain. The balloon on the Foley is inflated, the purse-string sutures are tied, and suction is applied to the Foley, collapsing the bulla. The pleural drain is discontinued after 48 hours, whereas the endocavitary drain is removed in 8 to 21 days. 67, 68 Endocavitary drainage of giant bullae offers a limited surgical approach that avoids resection of underlying lung while providing symptomatic relief and functional improvement. Most investigators reserve this treatment for patients who would not otherwise tolerate a thoracotomy, 68 but some advocate it as the first surgical choice for any patient with a giant bullae. 69 ",

The frequency of prolonged air leak is approximately 50% in most series. 73, 75 van Berkel et al Several studies have been performed to try to minimize the incidence and length of air leaks. Gentle handling of the lung tissue remains of paramount importance. The use of buttressed staple lines and surgical sealants has failed to show effectiveness in pulmonary resections as a whole. 60, [76] [77] [78] In contrast, there is evidence that, in the particular subset of patients with emphysematous lung, the use of buttresses 59, 61 and sealants 79 can decrease both the duration and severity of air leaks. Early placement of the pleural drains to water seal, rather than suction, has been shown to assist with sealing of air leaks. 80 ",

The program should Pneumothorax, Bullous Disease, and Emphysema include abstinence from tobacco products, an exercise training program, optimization of medical treatment, patient education, and psychosocial assessment. Exercise training is designed to increase endurance and decrease exertional dyspnea. Patients enrolled at the authors' LVRS program are required to complete an exercise program that has a goal of 30 minutes of daily continuous exercise, 5 days a week, on a treadmill or stationary bicycle. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals and Organizations also uses a minimal performance of 3 minutes of unloaded pedaling on a stationary bicycle as a prerequisite for LVRS surgery in the United States. A significant number of patients achieve enough improvement in their symptoms that they decline LVRS after undergoing exercise-based pulmonary rehabilitation. 84, 85 Exercise tolerance also has an important postoperative predictive value: the NETT trial demonstrated that, in patients with upper lobe predominant disease, patients with high exercise tolerance (ie, less impaired by the disease) did not have the same survival benefit from surgery as those more impaired patients with low exercise tolerance. 86 However, other clinical trials have amended enrollment criteria after observing an excessive mortality in the patients with the poorest exercise abilities.

Assuring the correct use of inhalers should be a component of any medical evaluation. Many patients with stable COPD symptoms use long-term corticosteroid therapy, despite the absence of prospective data supporting a benefit of steroids on lung function or its rate of decline. As such, tapering the use of corticosteroids preoperatively to the lowest possible dose is advised in an effort to avoid the associated risks of poor wound healing and infection.",

Rest and stress echocardiography, radionuclide ventriculograms, thallium imaging, and other studies can assist with cardiac risk stratification. However, the patient with COPD provides several unique challenges to these modalities, limiting the usefulness of such tests. Exercise testing is rarely useful because of the patient's inability to exercise to maximal heart rates. Chest hyperinflation can limit the visualization afforded by echocardiography, and concerns about bronchoconstriction may limit the use of dipyridimole or adenosine. As such, many otherwise acceptable surgical candidates eventually undergo right and left heart catheterization just before surgery. Any intervention must be coordinated among all physicians involved, because the placement of a drug-eluting coronary stent in a preoperative patient can have major implications on the timing and the conduct of the surgery.",

However, there is considerable variation in the interpretation of CT scans in these patients; the entire lung is affected to some degree by emphysema, and it may be difficult to assess the heterogeneity of the disease.

However, retrospective review of a patient population that met the high-risk criteria of the NETT protocol showed improved respiratory function at an acceptable risk of mortality. 91 This suggests that the presence of suitable anatomic heterogeneity of disease may be the most important determinant of outcome.

However, despite the improvements that have been made in lung transplants in the last 20 years, mortality remains approximately 50% at 5 years. 94 van Berkel et al SUMMARY Surgical intervention is a viable option in a select group of patients with severe, incapacitating emphysema. Only those patients who have failed to progress despite optimized medical therapy and a rigorous pulmonary rehabilitation regimen should be considered for surgical intervention. Pulmonary function tests, CT, and nuclear ventilation-perfusion scans further delineate those patients who are most likely to benefit from the operation, as well as determining which intervention is most likely to have a good outcome. The surgical options available to the patient depend on the spectrum of the distribution of their disease; isolated bullae can be treated with bullectomy, heterogeneous emphysema lends itself to LVRS, whereas homogeneous disease is best treated by lung transplantation. The ideal indicators for LVRS also include hyperinflation, an FEV 1 greater that 20%, and a normal PaCO 2 . In contrast, patients with a low FEV 1 , hypercapnia, and associated pulmonary hypertension are directed toward transplantation.",
