            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic is overwhelming healthcare systems worldwide. A significant portion of COVID-19 patients develop pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), necessitating ventilator support. Some health systems do not have the capacity to accommodate this surge in ventilator demand, leading to shortages and inevitable mortality. Some clinicians have, of necessity, jerry-rigged ventilators to support multiple patients, but these devices lack protected air streams or individualized controls for each patient. Moreover, some have not been tested under conditions of ARDS. We have developed the Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE), a rapidly deployable platform to more safely use a single ventilator to simultaneously support multiple critically-ill patients. The iSAVE enables patient-specific volume and pressure control and incorporates safety features to mitigate cross-contamination between patients and flow changes due to patient interdependencies within the respiratory circuit. Here we demonstrate through simulated and in vivo pig evaluation the capacity of the iSAVE to support a range of respiratory clinical states. By leveraging off-theshelf components that are readily available to intensive care unit (ICU) caregivers, the iSAVE could potentially be translated for human application to expand the ventilation capacity of hospitals using existing ventilators, minimizing the need to procure additional ventilators.",

To address the need to expand ventilator capacity whilst incorporating the translational constraints associated with a rapidly developing pandemic such as COVID-19, we have developed the Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE ). This system repurposes existing flow regulation valves in the medical industry to utilize a single ventilator to provide personalized support to at least two patients. The iSAVE's ventilation circuit enables independent control of volume and pressure for each patient and incorporates safety measures to accommodate sudden patient deterioration and cross contamination. Here, we describe the design and validation of the iSAVE through benchtop and in vivo tests splitting a single ventilator to two patients. We hypothesize that our system will be capable of maintaining desired ventilation parameters to each patient amidst static and dynamic changes in resistance and compliance. We simulate several clinical scenarios, focusing on those relevant to the management of ARDS, and validate the safety mechanisms of the iSAVE. Leveraging offthe-shelf components, the iSAVE can facilitate a rapid expansion of the ventilation capacity of hospitals.",

Modern ventilators enable the control of various parameters including tidal volume (VT), inspiratory pressure, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), fractional oxygen concentrations (FiO2), and respiratory rate. Patients with ARDS are usually ventilated using low VT ventilation and high PEEP to limit lung injury (lung-protective ventilation), which has been shown to improve patient mortality. 11 For lung-protective ventilation using volume-control, VT, PEEP, and respiratory rate are carefully set based on individual patient parameters while inspiratory pressure varies. Alternatively, pressure control ventilation can be used, in which pressure applied to the airway is constant and VT varies.",

The PEEP valve released excess volume during the period of titration, preventing overdistention of the healthy lung. The desired volume of 400 mL/lung was restored by titrating the flow control valve. We then started with two lungs simulating ARDS (C = 20 mL/cm H2O, R = 5 cm H2O/L/s) and increased the compliance of one lung (C: 15 mL/cm H2O to 50 mL/cm H2O black), which created a shift in the volumes delivered. Adjustment of the flow control valve restored the desired flow to both lungs ( Figure 1F ) in less than 13 breaths.",

We also simulated the loss of the endotracheal tube to one lung, which causes a leak in the system yielding minimized flow to either lung. This activated the main ventilator leak alarm. We closed the valve to the disconnected lung and titrated the other valve to deliver the desired volume ( Figure 1H ).

In a set of scenarios mimicking the clinical evolution of patients with ARDS and sudden events that could jeopardize the ventilation of other patients, the system is able to handle circuit dependencies and deliver the desired therapeutic parameters to each channel. Our approach employs valves and sensors to similarly prevent life-threatening shunting of flow away from diseased patients to relatively healthier patients. The positioning of circuit components further overcomes issues of backflow, contamination, and higher pressures. We also validated that obstruction or disconnection of a tube will activate pressure or volume-based alarms in the ventilator.

In the inspiratory limbs, the following components were connected in series: 1) a bacterial/viral filter (Main Flow Bacterial/Viral Filter, Teleflex Medical), 2) ball valve (EKWB G \u00bc'' Nickel, Microcenter), 3) one-way valve (a Threshold PEP positive expiratory pressure device, Philips, was used as a surrogate for one-way valves), 4) pressure sensor, 5) flow sensor, and 6) capnostat adaptor. In the expiratory limb, the following components were connected in series: 1) a bacterial/viral filter, 2) a pressure release valve (PEEP valve), and 3) an optional one-way valve prior to connection with the ventilator (Threshold PEP). PTFE tubing was used to adapt the ball valves to the standard 22mm outer diameter corrugated flex tubing. A dual adult lung simulator (Model 5600i, Michigan Instruments) was used to perform simulations with the closed-circuit ventilator. Pressure and flow were displayed and recorded by the Philips NM3 monitors and associated sensors, one for each channel.",

            "text": "Benchtop testing protocol 1) Check for leaks and alarms: We first tested the ability of the system to perform ventilation without leaks. We then disconnected a lung to ensure the activation of standard alarms on the ventilator. 2) Variable tidal volume production: Starting with both flow valves fully open, we measured the flow and pressure delivered to each lung. Then, we gradually closed one of the valves, measuring the distribution of flow, to map the range of volume distribution capable of the system. 3) Maintenance of VT following static changes to compliance and resistance: Patient interdependencies in the circuit pose a major challenge for the multiplexing approach of ventilation. As a patient degenerates or recovers, changes in tissue compliance and resistance occur. These cause shifts in the overall circuit's flow dynamics. We modulated the compliance and/or resistance of one test lung, measured the effect of the intervention, and titrated the valve until the baseline parameters were reached. Resistors (Rp5, Rp20, Rp50 and Rp500 Michigan Instruments) were utilized for all benchtop testing. We performed these tests with baseline parameters set to those of 1) a healthy lung (C = 50 cmH20, Rp5) 2) a lung with ARDS (C = 20 cmH20, Rp5-50). While the flow valve was the main variable we modulated, in some cases, the ventilator's tidal volume or inspiration : expiration ratio was also adjusted. These cases are specifically mentioned in the results section. 4) Maintenance of VT following dynamic changes to compliance and resistance. Sudden deterioration of a patient (blood clot, pneumothorax) or equipment malfunction (kinked endotracheal tube) pose great risk to the balance of ventilation between patients. We tested the ability of the iSAVE to manage these scenarios. We simulated acute changes by disconnecting or clamping tubes and monitoring the ventilator's response. The flow valves were also titrated to return the circuit to its baseline.",

            "text": "Animal experiments were approved by the Committee on Animal Care at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The experiment was performed as part of a terminal procedure on a 70kg female swine (n=1). The iSAVE was connected to a veterinary anesthesia ventilator (Model 200IE, Hallowell EMC) delivering 2% isoflurane in oxygen. One inspiratory circuit was connected to the anesthesia machine delivering gas to the animal while the other inspiratory circuit was connected to an artificial linear test lung (IngMar Medical). Pressure and flow measurements were recorded on the inspiratory limb of the animal. A VetTrends Vital Signs Monitor was utilized to measure SpO2, ETCO2, RR, and other physiological parameters. 600mL of VT were equally distributed between the animal and test lung. A respiratory rate between 18-20/min was set on the ventilator. We carried out the same tests outlined in the benchtop testing protocol, modulating the parameters of the test lung, to validate the capabilities of the iSAVE to restore the system to baseline. Once the animal was euthanized, to acutely change the compliance of the pig's lung, we utilized an endoscope (PENTEX) to deliver 50mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Sigma Aldrich) into the left and right bronchi. We then ventilated the animal, aiming to restore tidal volume to the baseline values prior to euthanasia. Approximately 10 minutes later, we delivered an additional 700mL of saline into the right and left bronchi. Ventilation was performed and the valves were titrated to achieve desired flow parameters.",
