            "text": "Rotavirus VP7 is a membrane-associated protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is the product of rotavirus gene 9 which potentially encodes a protein of 326 amino acids that contains two amino terminal hydrophobic domains, hl and h2, each preceded by an initiation codon. Comparison of the size of products derived from altered genes containing coding sequences for both hl and h2 with those lacking the hl sequence ('dhl' mutants), indicates that initiation takes place at M30 immediately preceding h2 (residues F32 to 1-,48) and that h2 is cleaved, confirming the studies of others (Stirzaker, S. C., P. L. Whitfeld, D. L. Christie, A. R. Bellamy, and G. W. Both. 1987. J. Cell Biol. 105:2897-2903). Our previous work had shown that deletions in the carboxy end of h2, extending to amino acid 61 in the open reading frame, resulted in secretion of VP7. The region from amino acid number 51-61, present in wild-type VP7 but missing in the secreted mutant A47-61, was thus implicated to have a role in ER retention. To test this, a series of chimeric genes were constructed by fusing the first 63 codons of wild-type VP7, Al-14 or A51-61/ dhl, to the mouse salivary ~t-amylase gene, a secretory protein, such that the fusion junction was located at the exact mature terminus of amylase. The chimeric proteins VP763/amylase, Al-14Jamylase and A51-6163/dhl/amylase were secreted when expressed in cells and the h2 domain was cleaved when mRNA was translated in vitro. These results imply that the sequence 51-61 is necessary but not sufficient for ER retention. When a second series of VP7/amylase chimera were constructed extending the VP7 contribution to amino acid 111, the product expressed by AI-14HI/ amylase was not secreted whereas that of A47-61 ttl/ amylase was. Significantly, the intracellular Al-14m/amylase product exhibited an amylase enzymatic specific activity that was similar to that of the wild-type amylase product. We conclude that two regions of VP7 mediate its retention in the ER, the first lies within the sequence 51-61 and the second within the sequence 62-111, which contains the glycosylation site for VP7. Both regions are necessary for retention, though neither is sufficient alone.",

For several lumenal ER proteins, the sequence 'KDEL' at the carboxy terminus is necessary for their ER retention (4, 20, 24, 25) whereas ER specific retention sequence(s) have not been demonstrated for ER membrane-associated proteins. Viral protein expression systems have been useful for elucidating targeting behavior of proteins to the plasma membrane (1, 7, 9) or Golgi apparatus (21) . Rotavirus provides a similarly useful model system for investigating membrane-associated proteins targeted to the ER. During the maturation of rotavirus, virus cores assemble in cytoplasmic viroplasm structures, subsequently bud through the membranes of the rough ER or nuclear envelope and acquire a transient membrane envelope (8, 28, 29) . The mature double-capsid nonenveloped virions accumulate in the ER lumen. The structural glycoprotein and major neutralizing antigen VP7, is initially a membrane-associated protein with a lumenal orientation (13) . VP7 exhibits only a high-mannose tbrm of carbohydrate (13) consistent with its location solely in the ER (28, 29) . It is not known how VP7 assembles into virus particles nor by what mechanism the membrane elements are removed during virus maturation.",

            "text": "Gene 9, which codes for VP7, has been cloned and sequenced (5) , and exhibits an open reading frame potentially encoding a protein 326 residues in length. Hydrophobicity analysis (17) indicates the presence of only two hydrophobic domains (hi and h2) located at the amino terminus, each preceded by an in-frame initiation codon, the second of which exhibits the stronger consensus sequence for initiation (15, 16) . Our previous studies showed that deletions at the COOH-terminal end of h2 and the adjacent 13 residues resulted in secretion of the altered VP7's (31) . More recent evidence (42) shows that h2 is cleaved after amino acid No. 50, suggesting that the distal 11 residues are significant for ER retention, rather than h2. We therefore investigated whether the region of amino acids 51-61 played a role in retention of VP7 in the ER, since they were present in the wild-type VP7 but absent in the secreted mutants A42-61, A43-61, or A47-61. VP7 coding sequences containing this 11-amino acid region or those which deleted it, were attached to those of mature mouse salivary a-amylase, a secretory protein, to assay for an effect on retention in the ER. Additional chimera were also constructed consisting of the mature amylase coding region and a larger contribution from the VP7 amino-terminal coding region of the deletions Al-14 and A47-61/dhl, which extended up to amino acid 111 and included the VP7 glycosylation site. Amylase enzymatic activity was similarly demonstrated for both wild-type amylase and the intracellularly retained chimera. We show in the present study that two regions of VP7 mediate its retention in the ER. The first lies within the region spanning amino acids 51-61 and the second in the region 62-111, the latter containing the single glycosylation site for VP7. Both regions are apparently necessary for retention, though neither is sufficient to function by itself.",

The amino acid sequence of the first 111 residues of VP7 and the first 30 of a-amylase, are illustrated by letter code. The single glycosylation site of wild-type VP7 at residue 69 is depicted (CHO) as are the two hydrophobic domains (h/and h2). The various restriction sites used for creating the VP7 mutants lacking the first initiation codon (dhl series) or the VP7-amylase chimera are shown above the appropriate sequence. The numbers above the amino acids in the wild-type and deletions refer to the amino acid position in the wild-type sequence. The deletions A51-61, A47-61, A43-61 and A42-61 each retain the coding sequence for amino acid 1 through 50, 46, 42, or 41, respectively, and delete the amino acid coding sequence specified. The 'dhl' counterparts of these mutants each have a noncoding sequence (thin lines) preceding the initiating methionine at position 30, and the deletions of the amino acid coding sequences are shown (dotted lines). The arrow beneath the wild-type amylase sequence shows the position of the cleavage site for signal peptidase. The chimeric VP7amylase coding sequences consist of either a wildtype or altered 5' VP7 coding sequence, extending to either amino acid 63 or 111, joined to the amylase sequence that extends from amino acid 16 to its terminus (VP%3/Am, Al-1463/Am, A51-6163/ dhl/Am, Al-14.1/Am, and A47-61m/dhl/Am).",

Precise deletion of the 5' signal sequence coding region of amylase was achieved by Apa I restriction of pJC/Am, blunting of the end which formed the junction between VP7 and amylase with T4 polymerase, followed by Xho I digestion which removed the small Xho I/Apa I fragment encoding the amylase signal but which retained the exact amino terminus of mature amylase (39) .

However, since the coding regions for both initiation codons and hydrophobic domains were present, it was not known from which codon initiation began nor which hydrophobic domain was used for translocation. Deletion mutants A42-61/dhl, A43-61/dhl, and A 4 7 -61/dhl, each lacking the first initiation codon and thus hi, were constructed in the present study to compare the products of both types of mutants. COS7 cells transfected with mutants containing either both initiation codons or those with only the second initiation codon secreted products of identical size, indicating that the first hydrophobic domain is probably not normally translated (Fig. 2, lanes 1-12, upper and lower arrows, glycosylated and unglycosylated VP7, respectively). Intracellular VP7 products also exhibited the same mobility whether or not the first A U G was present and were endo-H sensitive (data not shown). It is apparent that the mutant VP7 proteins of the 'dhl' series were each able to use their shortened h2 hydrophobic domains to target to and translocate into the ER. Secreted VP7 products which were glycosylated (upper arrow in Fig. 2) , were all endo-H resistant, consistent with their passage out of the E R through the Golgi apparatus and their modification to complex type of carbohydrate. As noted previously (31), wild-type VP7 was not secreted when cells were transfected with pJC9 (lanes 13 and 14) . Likewise, nonspecific bands in the position of VP7 were not observed in the media of control cells transfected with vector that did not contain insert, p J C l l 9 (lanes 15 and 16) . Roughly equivalent amounts of material were obtained from either the original deletion or its 'dhl' counterpart (i.e., A42-61 and A42-61/dhl, Fig. 2, lanes 1-4) . When the kinetics of secreted VP7 for deletions A47-61 and A47-61/dhl were examined in transfected cells after a 15-min pulse with L[asS]methionine followed by a 1-, 2-, or 3-h chase in medium containing 2 mM unlabeled methionine, a lag time of ~ 30 rain was seen for A47-61 and A47-61/dhl before secretion occurred in a linear fashion (inset in Fig. 2) .",

Translation of total viral message, in the presence of membranes, yielded a band which was similar in size to that from infected cells (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1 and 4) . In the present study, the VP7 messages did not appear to be bicistronic as previously described by others (6) . The primary translation product (Fig. 3, lane 3) was slightly larger than the membrane modified product which had carbohydrate removed with endo-H (lane 2), likely indicating signal sequence cleavage. Wild-type VP7 made from the in vitro transcription/ translation system was the same size as VP7 made from viral message in the case of the primary translation product (Fig.  3 , lane 3 vs. lane 7), the membrane modified product (Fig. 3 , lane 4 vs. lane 5), or the latter treated with endo-H (Fig. 3 , lane 2 vs. lane 6). When Al-14 products were also compared, it was observed that the glycosylated species had the same mobility as VP7 in infected cells and the in vitro translated wild-type VP7 product. The primary translation product of Al-14 (Fig. 3, lane 9 ) was slightly larger than the membrane modified product treated with endo-H (Fig. 3 , lane 8), and was identical to primary products translated from wild-type VP7 mRNA and that of viral message. This also implies signal sequence cleavage of the Al-14 product in the presence of membranes. Since A1-14 lacks the first AUG, one can conclude that VP7 produced in infected cells, VP7 translated from either total viral message, wild-type VP7 mRNA, or Al-14 mRNA, each initiate at the second AUG immediately preceding h2. A similar comparison of the size of deglycosylated products made in transfected cells or in the in vitro translation system showed that initiation and translation were occurring identically in both systems (data not shown). Within these VP7 sequences, Alaso-Glns~ occurs in a context of amino acid residues which form a site with a high probability of signal peptidase cleavage, as the predictive rules regarding signal cleavage are applied (39) . Significantly, this site is absent in the mutant product of A51-61/dhl. Its primary translation product (Fig. 3, lane 12 , upper band) is the same size as the membrane modified product treated with endo-H (Fig. 3, lane 11) . Evidently the h2 domain is not cleaved in A51-61/dhl. The size of the glycosylated molecule (Fig. 3, lane 13) is larger than VP7 found in infected cells, or that translated in vitro from wildtype VP7 mRNA, consistent with this conclusion. The primary translation product showing a faster gel mobility (Fig.   3 , lane 12, lower band) probably corresponds to a product resulting from downstream initiation of Met63 and represents a species probably not translocated into the lumen of the ER.",

No product of that size was obtained when anti-VP7 antibody was used, since it is likely that only two amino acids of the VP7 sequence remain following signal cleavage and are insufficient for recognition by anti-VP7 antibody.

Lysates of COS7 cells that were transfected with either the plasmid containing the gene for wild-type amylase or the chimera Al-14m/Am were assayed for the release of maltose, or dextrins, due to the enzymatic action of a-amylase and compared with a maltose standard curve. Amylase activity was proportional to the amount of lysate from cells producing either wild-type amylase or the Al-14ttt/Am chimera, whereas lysate from cells treated with only the transfection reagents (DEAE/dextran) did not display any activity (Fig. 8) . A second assay, where the amount of It-amylase activity of lysates was measured by determining the amount of soluble chromogen liberated by enzymatic hydrolysis from a Procion Yellow starch substrate also confirmed these results (data not shown). To check the relative specific activity of chimeric and wild-type amylase, transfected cells were steady state labeled for 24 h with L[35S]methionine and the amount of Al-14m/Am or wt amylase in equal cell numbers was determined by densitometry of autoradiographs after immunoprecipitated products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Amylase activity was determined in a separate duplicate sample of transfected cells for both wt amylase or the Al-14m/Am chimera. The specific activity, expressed as a ratio of enzyme activity to gel band intensity, was 3.9 x 10 -4 for Al-14m/Am compared with 4.2 x 10 -4 for wt amylase. The similarity in specific activities shows that amylase activity was proportional to the amount of enzyme present, whether in the chimeric or in the wild-type forms. We conclude that the retained chimeric protein was probably not in a denatured form in the ER and exhibits a con- . Amylase enzymatic activity of lysates from cells transfected with wildtype amylase (pJC/Am) or the VP7-amylase chimera (Al-14m/Am). Lysates were assayed for the release of maltose from a starch substrate due to the enzymatic action of a-amylase. This release was compared with a control amylase standard and a maltose standard curve (squares, Al-14m/Am; triangles, pJC/ Am; circles, control, transfection reagents only).",

            "text": "The data presented in this paper more accurately define the region of rotavirus VP7 responsible for its retention in the ER. In our previously published work (31) we presented evidence that deletions in portions of the amino terminus of VP7 resulted in the secretion of altered molecules, apparently via the normal secretory pathway, including passage through the Golgi apparatus (see Fig. 9 ; wt VP7, Al-14, and A47-61). A major conclusion arising from our previous work was that the secretory pathway may be the default pathway in the absence of specific overriding signals which target membrane or lumenal proteins to destinations other than the extracellular milieu. Support for this hypothesis derived from observations of Wieland et al. (41) who showed that a tripeptide, comprising an asparagine-linked glycosylation site, could be glycosylated in the ER, further processed in the Golgi apparatus and rapidly secreted. Likewise, ER lumenal proteins characterized by the sequence 'KDEIg at their carboxy terminus were also efficiently secreted when this sequence was removed (25) . A review of the subject (30) also reaches the conclusion that intracellular targeting may be the result of specific retention signals. As described above, VP7 has two amino terminal hydrophobic domains (hl and h2) in the open reading frame. It appears from the work of others (37) , and is confirmed by the present study, that hi is not translated in the bulk of VP7 in vitro or in transfected cells. The preferred site of initiation is at M3o immediately preceding the h2 domain. h2 functions as a cleavable signal sequence (37) , an observation confirmed in the present work by the decrease in size of the product processed in the presence of membranes for the wt VP7, and may also in A47-61, A47-61/dhl (Fig. 2 ) and the previously described deletion mutants A42-61 and A43-61 (data not shown). Our previous conclusion (31) that the h2 domain itself contains the ER retention information must be modified, refocussing attention on the sequence Qs~ to G6t, lying immediately to the carboxy terminus of h2, which also had been deleted in the secreted ver- sions of VP7. To test its role in retention of VP7 in the ER, this sequence and the appropriate sequences of the amino terminus of VP7 were joined to the exact mature amino terminus of mouse salivary a-amylase, normally a secreted protein. As shown in the present work, the presence of this sequence was not sufficient to prevent the secretion of amylase ( Fig. 4 ; Al-1463/Am). As expected, the chimera A51-6163/ dhl/Am was also secreted but, curiously, its signal sequence h2 domain was apparently cleaved (data not shown) whereas in A51-61/dhl (Fig. 3 ) the h2 domain appeared not to be cleaved. The VP7 h2 cleavage site As0-Qst is not present in A51-61/dhl nor in A51-6163/dhl/Am. However, at the deletion junction, R49AsoA62M63 forms a high probability signal peptidase cleavage site which may not be used in A51-61/dhl because of the proximity of the glycosylation site at N69 in VP7. The absence of any nearby glycosylation site in the chimera may allow peptidase activity for A51-6163/dhl/Am thereby generating a cleaved product. The data obtained when the expressed chimeric products were immunoprecipitated with either VP7 or amylase antiserum, add support to the conclusion that the signal of each chimera is cleaved. It was apparent from the aforementioned that the presence of the sequence Q51-G61 in VP7 is required for retention but in itself is not sufficient. When a larger portion of the VP7 amino terminus was fused to amylase, it was found that the chimera was retained intracellularly, presumably in the ER since the asparagine-linked oligosaccharide on the VP7 portion was in the high-mannose form. The additional VP7 sequence (62-111) also was not sufficient in itself to cause retention in the ER, since the chimera A47-61m/dhl/Am was also secreted (see Fig. 9 ). One must therefore conclude that two regions near the amino terminus of VP7 cooperate in its ER retention function. We do not know if the region encompassing amino acids 62-111 is part of a binding site or whether it acts as a 'spacer' allowing the region 51-61 to function. In the chimera used to demonstrate the cooperativity of the two regions, Al-14m/Am exhibits amylase activity at levels similar to that of the wt amylase gene expressed in these cells. The specific activity of the enzyme was similar in chimeric and wild-type products. These results indicate that at least the amylase portion of the chimera was in the correct conformation and that the reason for retention was not due to denaturation of the chimeric protein.",

            "text": "The method by which VP7 is retained in the ER is unresolved. Though clearly not a membrane spanning protein, VP7 is membrane bound (13) . The mode of this attachment is not obvious. If an a-helical wheel (32) of the amino acid residues from Q51 at the mature amino terminus to Wl, is constructed, a marked amphipathicity is observed with all the charged residues segregated to one segment of the circumference of the wheel. Such a hydrophobic face may be present in the folded structure and mediate membrane at-tachment. The rotavirus nucleocapsid protein VP6 has been shown to oligomerize (11) and whether or not VP7 oligomerizes is being examined. The possibility exists that an amphipathic character may influence oligomerization and play a role in the membrane association of VP7. The nature of the ER retention of the VP7 is also being investigated and presumably involves some specific sorting feature such that the organelle retains its characteristic components. Such sorting remains an elusive problem for the retention of all types of ER molecules including the integral membrane proteins HMG CoA reductase (19) , ribophorins (33) , signal sequence receptor (40) , ERP99 (20) , adenovirus E3 (26), the lumenal protein of the ER disulfide isomerase esterases (24) , and heavy chain binding protein (4) . With respect to the latter class, 'KDEL', found to be necessary for targeting other proteins, is not a component of VP7 and cannot explain its ER retention. There is no sequence homology with other ER constituents on the primary sequence level although it remains to be determined whether folded structures of ER constituents bear any resemblance to each other.",
