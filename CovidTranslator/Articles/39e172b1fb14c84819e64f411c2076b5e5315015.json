The development of these Guidelines in the 1980s was a significant departure from previous 'international standards', emphasising their advisory nature to national governments and the importance of their adaptation to take account of national and local sociocultural, environmental and economic circumstances. This philosophy was maintained in the second edition, which provided guidance on many more individual chemicals. In 1995, it was decided to revise the guidelines to account for advancing scientific knowledge with respect to drinking water quality. This especially related to microbial hazards and infectious disease risks. Since the early 1990s, a process of 'rolling revision' of the GDWQ has led to more frequent updating including additional publications regarding the chemical and microbiological aspects of drinking water quality and toxic cyanobacteria in water and addenda to the Guidelines themselves. All these publications and the Guidelines are freely available on the Internet (http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq).",

Assessing the adequacy of systems, defining and monitoring control measures and establishing management plans are the three components of the so-called 'water safety plans' (WSPs).

The number of water-transmitted viruses in the water is determined by shedding of viruses by symptomatic patients as well as asymptomatically infected humans. Moreover, initially zoonotic viruses may be excreted by both the animal and the human host (see Text box 2). Subsequent virus disintegration in the environment depends on the specific sensitivity of the virus to inactivation, e.g. by radiation, temperature and its tendency to attach or aggregate with particles (reviewed by John and Rose, 2005) . Viruses that are efficiently transmitted via blood or respiratory droplets generally have a limited resistance in the water, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), whereas other, mainly faecal-oral transmission of viruses such as poliovirus, are much more resilient (Moore, 1993) . This range of viral resistance in the water is defined by the virus properties such as size, shape, charge, etc. The possible public health threat of (re-)emerging viruses should be assessed based on these particle characteristics. For example, SARS lead to the investigation of previously described respiratory agents such as Legionella. The newly identified SARS coronavirus was initially characterised as a respiratory virus without estimating its potential for transmission via water (Ksiazek et al., 2003) . Subsequent research showed the common high level of excretion in faeces from infected individuals (Ding et al., 2004) . Experimental studies showed stability of infectious virus for",

Gastroenteritis may manifest itself with very general complaints such as abdominal cramps, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, etc. On the other hand, projectile vomiting is characteristic for specific viruses, i.e. NoV, and bloody diarrhoea is quite uncommon with viral gastroenteritis. The same holds true for hepatitis that may be associated with either one of two specific waterborne viruses (HAV and HEV) or one other virus out of five different virus families but also with alcohol abuse or, though uncommonly, microsporidia infection. Second, it may not be possible to discern water-transmitted disease from disease contracted via other routes such as person to person, utensils or food. And in case of food, the transmission route may involve water such as preparation of lemonade or ice cubes and The virus infections and symptoms resulting from either described route of transmission will be the same. Moreover, in the presence of other obvious high-risk exposures the drinking water may not be considered as the source of infection and disease, for instance in case of bottled water versus fruits or vegetables consumed raw. Nevertheless, if locally food-borne disease encompasses a higher burden as compared with waterborne disease, then it should be given correspondingly greater attention taking also into account costs and impacts of available interventions. A third aspect hindering the estimation of waterborne viral disease burden is the incubation period; it may take several weeks for some viral diseases such as hepatitis to manifest themselves. The time of peak contamination in the source, failure in treatment or contamination in the distribution may be long gone. Also the drinking water may comply with regulations involving bacterial counts but these may be insufficient with respect to reduction of human pathogenic viruses. And fourth, the primary source may be drinking water but in case of high-level secondary transmission from person to person this may go unnoticed. However, in recent years methodology and awareness have improved greatly resulting in more and more publications on drinking-water disease outbreaks (Poullis et al., 2005) . Remarkably few outbreaks were described associated with exposure to enteroviruses in drinking or recreational waters. Recently, large outbreaks with hundreds of cases of meningitis were reported for both types of exposure (Hauri et al., 2005; Amvrosieva et al., 2006) . Also, the causative agent of the first reported waterborne outbreak of hepatitis E in Delhi, India in 1955 and 1956 was not identified until the 1990s with the advances in molecular and immunodiagnostics (Worm et al., 2002) .",

Including different viruses reflecting the diverse characteristics with respect to their replication rates, natural reduction and reduction by treatment will improve the eventual drinking water quality by optimising the drinking water supply from source to tap. For viruses transmitted by the faecal-oral route, drinking water is only one vehicle of transmission. Contamination of food, hands, utensils and clothing can also play a role, particularly when domestic sanitation and hygiene are poor. Since water is the most important transmission route for some viruses whereas others are mainly transmitted via food or person to person, improvements in the quality and availability of water, in excreta disposal and in general hygiene are all important in reducing faecal-oral transmission of viruses. In combination with target microbes representing other pathogen groups, i.e. bacteria, parasites and helminths, performance targets can be developed that encompass both control challenges and health significance for a broad range of pathogens. In addition to source water quality, treatment efficiency and distribution, disease burden and dose-response relationships for specific pathogens serve as the basic parameters for the derivation of performance targets. Performance targets may be derived in relation to exposure to specific pathogens; however, account should be taken of the impact of short-term peaks in virus concentration on overall exposure and therefore the risk of drinking water disease.",

Similarly, viral diseases may be compared with disease associated with other pathogen groups or with each other. The hazard identification may be hampered, though, by the equivalence of disease symptoms of viral and non-viral diseases as explained above for gastroenteritis and hepatitis that may have alternative causes. A common metric taking into account differing probabilities, severities and duration of effects is the disability adjusted life year (DALY) widely used by WHO in the GDWQ. The range of differing severities, including acute, delayed and chronic effects and both morbidity and mortality associated with the specific viral pathogen have to be known. In addition, infection with a water-transmitted virus may have more severe disease outcome in vulnerable individuals as compared with the general population.

These double infections are more likely to occur as a result of consumption of drinking water or water-contaminated foods but not of personto-person transmission. Two, consumption of virus-contaminated drinking water from a reservoir or served by a piped distribution reaches a relatively large part of the population rapidly leading to many exposures of humans and perhaps animals.

The principles of HACCP are based on developing an understanding of the system, prioritising risks and ensuring that appropriate control measures are in place to reduce risks to an acceptable level. These same principles have been long applied in drinking water safety management and more recently have been refined and tailored to the context of drinking water (Havelaar, 1994) following the application of HACCP by several water utilities in the world (see example for Australia in http://www.who.int/wsportal/wsp/en/). Such a systematic management approach to water safety by the water suppliers was translated by WHO into a so-called WSP that incorporates system protection and process control. The WSP objectives are to ensure safe drinking water through good water supply practice. This involves preventing contamination of source waters, treating the water to the extent necessary to meet health-based targets and preventing contamination during storage, distribution and handling of drinking water. A WSP comprises system assessment and design, operational monitoring and management plans, including documentation and communication, concerning all aspects of the drinking water supply from catchment to consumer. The WHO GDWQ asks for the inclusion of management plans as an integral part of the WSPs. These plans should describe actions to be taken during normal operation or incident conditions. The system assessment should be documented (including upgrade and improvement). Furthermore, monitoring and communication plans and supporting programmes should be described. In this way the management and control of drinking water supply are safeguarded and continued through systematic and detailed assessment and prioritisation of hazards and the operational monitoring of barriers or control measures. Moreover, in case of emergencies plans of action are in place with consent of the people involved, which can be readily initiated, and these plans have been rehearsed in emergency drills. The control measures as described in the WSP will be effective to protect public health from water-related viral disease. WSP issues, specifically with respect to human pathogenic viruses in drinking water, are discussed below.",

According to the US National Academy of Sciences, the successive steps of the risk assessment include the hazard identification, exposure assessment, dose-response modelling and risk characterisation to estimate the probability and consequences of infection-here specifically for individuals consuming various levels of viruses in the drinking water.

If information on specific virus types causing waterborne outbreaks exists (see Chapters 2 and 3) then outbreak data should be collected including the number of patients, their exposure and the number and type of viruses in the contaminated water to characterise the hazard and determine a dose-response relation (the latter instead of or in addition to human volunteer or animal studies). Numerous waterborne outbreaks of mainly NoV-associated gastroenteritis have been described originating from contaminated drinking water but often the descriptions are anecdotical or at best an epidemiological association was determined between exposure of the patients and the common water source. With the improvement of detection methods with respect to sensitivity and specificity the causative agent can be detected more often in the water and typed with similar sequences in the patients and the common water source. Especially screening of patient samples for the virus followed by specific design of the detection method for monitoring the environment enhances the chance of success in confirming the link (Duizer and Koopmans, 2006; Hoebe et al., 2004) . In some instances, the cause of the drinking water contamination is resolved and the drinking water was found to be contaminated by sewage through pump failure or blockage of a sewage system. In other cases, inadequate or failing treatment processes lead to insufficient removal of viruses from source waters for drinking water production. Only recently enteric cytopathic human orphan (ECHO) virus type 30 has been identified as an important waterborne agent of meningitis in different parts of the world.",

            "text": "Selection and prioritisation of viral hazards. To be able to select and prioritise human pathogenic viruses to be included in the system assessment, criteria concerning the extent of the health risk, the waterborne transmission and the quantitative risk assessment need to be set. First of all, location-specific information on the prevalence of the virus infection and disease in the population is essential though it may be substituted by, for instance, knowledge on human pathogenic viruses in sewage or surface waters. Furthermore, viral disease outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic through severe defects to death (Table 3) , largely determine the health-based targets, since prevention of a high disease burden will be a more effective intervention as compared with prevention of disease with an overall low burden (see Section Health-based targets). The burden of viral disease involves the severity of disease as well as prevalence. For instance, if overall more individuals experience episodes of mild, limited viral gastroenteritis in a specific region then patients with a more severe health outcome, viral hepatitis, should also be considered in setting the health-based targets. Besides being dependent on the pathogenicity of the virus, the severity of viral disease also depends on the susceptibility of the host. The disease burden of rotavirus in high-income countries is much lower than in low-income countries with a much higher susceptible fraction of the population and more severe outcome of the infection (Havelaar and Melse, 2003;  http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/bathing/en/). The extent of the health risk associated with a specific virus is also determined by the ability to treat the virus infection and the availability of the treatment. Though the area of antiviral treatment is rapidly advancing, there is no cure for many viruses and in many countries there are no means to administer drugs to people in need. Vaccination strategies to prevent viral disease have been very successful. Smallpox was eradicated in 1978 and the eradication of poliomyelitis is in sight. (Re-)emergence of vaccine-preventable viral diseases should be monitored such as disease caused by vaccine-derived polioviruses, which can be efficiently transmitted via water (see Chapter 4). The possibility of a virus to spread epidemically and/or endemically is important in waterborne transmission because of the level of viruses circulating in the asymptomatic and symptomatic population and the total burden of viruses shed into the environment, and if relevant, also those viruses derived from animals. In case of HEV it was found that the consumption of liver and blood of domestic pigs, wild boar and/or deer leads to infections with HEV variants causing hepatitis E in the exposed individuals (Li et al., 2005) . The human HEV strains were phylogenetically related to the animal variants (Lu et al., 2006) . Moreover, HEV transmission is primarily water-and food-borne but may also be transmitted via blood transfusion, contact with sewage or animals or vertical transmission (Singh et al., 2003; Vaidya et al., 2003; Li et al., 2005) . These routes of HEV transmission appear to be more efficient as compared with person-to-person transmission (Somani et al., 2003) . Other possible zoonotic viruses such as some porcine NoV and sapoviruses (SaV) are genetically or antigenically related to human strains (Wang et al., 2006) . Recombinants within NoV and SaV occur for human and pig strains, and the high prevalence and sub-clinical infection rate of these viruses in pigs raise questions of whether pigs may be reservoirs for human strains or for the emergence of new human and porcine recombinants. The occurrence of zoonotic virus strains stresses the need to take animal reservoirs into consideration regarding source protection and when assessing the health risk for drinking water.",

In addition to disease surveillance in the population to whom the (produced) drinking water is delivered, environmental surveillance can aid the identification of the viral hazards by typing and quantification. Data resulting from studies on human pathogenic viruses in sewage and surface waters are accumulating. Raw sewage waters were shown to contain human enteric viruses such as enteroviruses, reoviruses, rotaviruses, NoV and HEV (Clemente-Casares, 2003; Villena et al., 2003; Lodder and de Roda Husman, 2005) . In most studies presence/absence data were shown but the virus concentrations were not determined. Though some viruses such as specific entero-and adenoviruses can be cultured, there is no susceptible cell line for many other human pathogenic viruses. In this case, the virus concentration may be estimated from molecular data collected by (semi-)quantitative and/or real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Typically 10 6 viral genomes can be detected in raw sewage as compared with 10 3 infectious viruses (Schvoerer et al., 2001; Laverick et al., 2004; Lodder and de Roda Husman, 2005; van den Berg et al., 2005) . In these studies the applied sewagetreatment processes approximately resulted in a limited 1-2 log 10 -units reduction as assessed by culture or molecular techniques. In general, primary and secondary sewage-treatment processes do not efficiently reduce the virus concentration in contrast with tertiary processes (Fleischer et al., 2000; Schvoerer et al., 2001; Gehr et al., 2003; van den Berg et al., 2005; Myrmel et al., 2006) . Bacteriophages may be useful in assessing reduction of human viruses by wastewater treatment processes (Lucena et al., 2004) . Wastewater treatment is warranted to reduce viral load in wastewaters discharging onto receiving waters (Godfree and Farrell, 2005) . However, since human viruses enter wastewater at high numbers wastewater will still contain viruses even after treatment. Therefore, in addition to wastewater overflows treated effluents will have to be taken into account as a significant source of viral pollution for wastewater used in agriculture and for surface waters used for aquaculture and fishery, recreational purposes or as a source for drinking water production. Moreover, both raw and treated sewage may contaminate groundwater through leakage (Abbaszadegan et al., 1999; Borchardt, 2003; Borchardt et al., 2004) .",

In some studies, the virus concentrations were determined in river water varying from 0.001 to 10 infectious entero-and reoviruses per litre to 5 to 5000 genomes for NoV and rotaviruses per litre of river water (Haramoto et al., 2005; Lodder and de Roda Husman, 2005) . Location-specific data on concentration and types of viruses in source waters and inactivation rates under the specific conditions in the specified waters are preferred for the hazard identification. In the absence of such data, virus data from other locations that may be considered comparable may also be employed. For instance, if treated and untreated urban sewage are discharged then it could be assumed that virus types such as enteroviruses and rotaviruses may be present and virus concentrations could be contracted from available studies. If there is sewage discharge from slaughterhouses, faecal pollution from wildlife such as wild boar or deer or wash-off of animal manure HEV and SaV could be present and may be carried to receiving waters. In case of rodent vermin hantaviruses could be expected.",

A few studies have shown the presence of human pathogenic viruses in untreated or treated drinking water used in different regions around the world (Leclerc et al., 2000) . As described surface waters may be contaminated with viruses originating from a diversity of sources. Similar human and animal sources may contaminate groundwater that is insufficiently protected from external influences. This may be the case with semi-or unconfined groundwater from sandy saturated zones or from limestone or marl or with pre-treated, artificially infiltrated surface water or with bank filtered water. Groundwater was shown to be positive for viruses in 8 or 16% of the samples analysed (Borchardt, 2003; Fout et al., 2003) . Reovirus, rotavirus, enterovirus, HAV and NoV were detected by molecular methods (Fout et al., 2003) . None of the samples was positive in case cell culture was applied to detect infectious enterovirus (Fout et al., 2003) . Another study revealed virus positivity in well waters by molecular (50%) and cell culture methods (5%; Borchardt et al., 2004) . The presence of NoV genomes could not be confirmed in mineral waters whether spring water or finished product (Lamothe et al., 2003) . Other studies confirmed virus-contaminated groundwater to be the source of outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis among hundreds of people (Parshionikar, 2003; Kim et al., 2005) . Interestingly in one of the studies the contamination appeared to be transient since none of the sequential well water samples were virus positive (Borchardt, 2003) . This may be due to short-term fluctuations in pathogen load caused by epidemics in the human or animal population, seasonal variations and/or incidents. The latter may encompass upstream (raw or treated) wastewater discharges, building of upstream sewage treatment plant or discharge, digging, drilling or maintenance near production site, injecting manure near unconfined source or discharge of polder waters near intake. Also heavy rainfall events, high river-/stream discharge and flow, high groundwater level, flooding of catchment/production site, thawing of (faecally contaminated) ice on reservoirs, frost leading to high numbers of birds on reservoirs and high numbers of birds (or other game) may be associated with peaks in faecal contamination of groundwater and also surface water.",

Infectious rotavirus and enterovirus were detected in 83% of treated drinking water samples associated with rainfall but not with the presence of bacterial indicators (Keswick et al., 1984) . In the African region, using cell culture, Ali et al. (2004) reported the presence of cultivable enteroviruses in 7 out of 30 finished drinking water samples at concentrations ranging from 5 to 33 plaqueforming units per litre. In Asian and African countries, integrated cell culture PCR enabled the detection of enteroviruses (Vivier et al., 2004) , adenoviruses (Van Heerden et al., 2003) or both (Lee and Kim, 2002; Lee and Jeong, 2004) in drinking water. With the use of only molecular methods the presence of several pathogenic viruses such as rotavirus (Divizia et al., 2004; van Zyl et al., 2004) , astrovirus (Gofti-Laroche et al., 2003) and NoV (Kukkula et al., 1999; Haramoto et al., 2004) were detected in drinking water in European, African and Asian countries. In another study in Thailand, no HAV was detected in tap waters, but in Brazil, 20% of river and tap waters were HAV positive (Kittigul, 2006; Villar et al., 2006) . In Canada, outbreaks were identified associated with the presence of HAV and NoV in drinking water (Schuster et al., 2005) .

The absence of pathogenic viruses in finished drinking waters does not exclude their presence but may merely indicate a lack of sensitivity of the detection techniques and/or the representativeness of the sampling. As shown with the recent advances in virus concentration and detection techniques more and more often human viruses are detected in tap water. However, at low dose viruses are still significant with respect to infectious and disease risk by exposure to drinking water because of their infectivity and pathogenicity and because of the large exposed population. An alternative approach in case of low virus concentrations in the finished waters is their detection in source waters combined with the assessment of the efficiency of drinking water treatment processes with respect to virus reduction. This approach ideally involves location-specific, quantitative information on the virus concentration in the source waters and virus reduction by treatment to estimate the virus concentration in the drinking water. In addition, information on the virus analysis, such as virus recovery rate of the method, infectivity and host specificity of the virus, are needed. Moreover, the local habits of drinking water consumption of the consumers should be known.",

Loss of virus particles during the analysis will lead to underestimation of the infectious risk. Virus recovery rates depend on the employed concentration and detection methods, the volume of water to be concentrated, the turbidity of the water and the characteristics of the target virus (Senouci et al., 1996; Hill et al., 2005; Olszewski et al., 2005; Polaczyk et al., 2006) . In order to determine the recovery rate of the sample analysis the procedure that is followed includes analysis of the viruses in the natural water sample and analysis of the same sample seeded with a specific dose of a known virus. This virus commonly involves the use of cultivable viruses such as specific enterovirus types or bacteriophages. These viruses are assumed to behave similarly to each other but differences in recovery between human and bacterial viruses have been reported (Hill et al., 2005) . Moreover, these model viruses often have undergone several passages through the susceptible cell line and are therefore considered cell line adapted strains, which will behave differently as compared with naturally occurring human pathogenic viruses in the environment. However, in the absence of alternative approaches experiments with model viruses need to be done preferably coinciding with each sample analysis since virus recovery rates have been found to be highly variable even when the virus and water type are kept constant (Denis-Mize et al., 2004) . In addition, in seed experiments often high virus levels are used to easily recover the model virus. But studies have shown that at the natural low dose virus recovery is lower and more variable (Fuhrman et al., 2005) . Though many studies were undertaken in the past years, further optimisation of methods with respect to virus recovery is still warranted.",

On the one hand, it may be argued that the detection of genomes of human pathogenic viruses in the drinking water is a necessary condition for the presence of infectious viruses. The employment of culture and molecular techniques in the detection of human pathogenic viruses in drinking water both encompass advantages and disadvantages. Susceptible cell lines are known for only some waterborne viruses and not for NoV (Duizer et al., 2004) and such cell lines may not be suitable for implementation as routine and robust diagnostic tools. Also, cell culture assays are laborious and expensive. On the other hand, plaque assays give quantitative results assuming that one plaque originates from one initial infectious virus particle.

Human pathogenic viruses may be present in tap water depending on the concentration in the source water and in case of treatment on the efficiency of the treatment processes with respect to virus reduction. The concentration of pathogenic viruses in the drinking water can be used to assess the health risk associated with the consumption of tap water, as has been done for different viruses (see Section Risk characterisation). However, the previous studies have not taken into account the dynamics of human pathogenic viruses meaning the variations in the prevalence and infectivity of viruses during transport and storage. First of all, though human and animal viruses do not grow during transport and storage, sanitation and hygiene problems may cause (re-)introduction of pathogens in the drinking water that may survive for the duration of storage as was shown for bacteriophages. In case of a piped distribution system, the virus concentration in tap water is determined by the viral burden of the source water on one hand and reduction by applied treatment processes (if this is the case) and during transport on the other hand. Reduction of viruses in drinking water may be caused if temperatures are high, i.e., most viruses are readily inactivated at over 201C (John and Rose, 2005) . Exposure of the viruses to, for instance, sunlight as well as other environmental factors will decrease the numbers of viruses rapidly (Lytle and Sagrapanti, 2005) . Again (re-)introduction of human pathogenic viruses may occur during maintenance and repair practices (Havelaar, 1994) . Second, biofilms may play an important role with respect to virus concentrations in the finished waters ( Fig. 2 ; Skraber et al., 2005) . Since it has been shown that viruses can attach to biofilms, there is a possibility that drinking water biofilms accumulate pathogenic viruses present in the water entering the distribution system acting as an additional removal process. On exposure to single viruses or sloughs containing viruses released from biofilms the consumer could be infected. Data on fate and behaviour of human pathogenic viruses during transport and storage are extremely limited but this information is of importance with respect to intervention measures.",

Here consumption of drinking water is discussed as route of transmission for human viruses disregarding exposure of the skin, eyes, ears and other body parts. Besides estimation of the concentration of virus in drinking water the assessment of the health risk posed by consumption of drinking water requires estimation of the volume of drinking water ingested and the response of the host to the ingested dose of viruses. Since waterborne viruses are readily inactivated at high temperatures the risk relates to the use of unboiled drinking water, e.g. excluding the consumption of tea but including the water used for washing salad and for making ice cubes. Global data on the consumption of drinking water are limited especially for the developing regions. In studies carried out in Canada, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the USA, the average daily per capita consumption was usually found to be less than 2 l, but there was considerable variation between individuals in different countries and within the same country. The daily median intake of cold tap water in The Netherlands was 0.052 l, in Germany 0.15 l, in the United Kingdom 0.475 l, in Sweden 0.8 l and in Australia 0.5-1 l (Mons et al., 2005; Fig. 2 Parameters that control virus behaviour in drinking water distribution systems. Viral inactivation was considered as follows.

As water intake will vary with climate, physical activity and culture, the above studies, which were conducted in temperate zones, can give only a limited view of consumption patterns throughout the world. At temperatures above 251C, e.g. there is a sharp rise in fluid intake, largely to meet the demands of an increased sweat rate (Howard and Bartram, 2005) . Other factors such as changes in cultural behaviour because of public awareness through information to the public or changes in the drinking-water demand or supply may also play a role in the habits of drinking water consumption. In the WHO GDWQ with respect to microbial hazards, per capita daily consumption of 1 l of unboiled water was assumed.",

The host may not experience symptoms though often acute symptoms will occur. These symptoms may be mild, severe and/or life-threatening (see Chapters 2, 3 and 4). A virus infection may become chronic and/or health effects may be delayed, so-called sequelae. Each of these health outcomes may result from infection with one and the same virus variant. For instance, infection with coxsackie virus variant B4 may pass unnoticed, cause gastroenteritis, cause myocarditis or diabetes or lead to infant death. The dose-response relation describes the quantitative relation between the intensity of exposure, i.e. the dose (here pathogenic viruses in drinking water), and the frequency of the occurrence of the adverse health effect within the exposed population of hosts, i.e. the response (here number of cases with specific symptoms in the human population). Available dose-response data have been obtained mainly from clinical studies including healthy adult volunteers but (premature) infants were included in some other studies (Teunis et al., 1996) . The dose-response relations have been determined for oral ingestion of some specific variants of waterborne rotavirus and enteroviruses during volunteer studies (Table 5) . As shown in Table 5 the probability of infection after consumption of one infectious virus may range from 0.000714 for poliovirus type 1 LSc2ab to 0.388 for poliovirus type 1 sm. The number of viruses that cause infection in 50% of the human volunteers may vary from 1.411 poliovirus type 1 sm to 69,300 poliovirus type 1 LSc2ab. These findings demonstrate the variability in infectivity not just between virus families but also between virus types and even between virus variants affecting the QMRA. On the other hand, it may reflect differences in exposed populations (from neonates to adults) and ways of exposure (ingestion to bathing). In case of a specific human pathogenic virus variant detected in a known fraction of the drinking water than specific dose-response relation should be used. However, often exposure is determined for a broad class of pathogens, like enterovirus concentrations as determined by use of a specific susceptible cell line (most commonly Buffalo green monkey, BGM). For such a large family of viruses a dose-response relation can be defined, but this should include an additional level of variation: differences in infectivity (and/or pathogenicity) between related virus strains. A hierarchic dose-response model could be applied, accounting for variability both within and between pathogenic virus strains (Teunis, personal communication) .",

The potential transmission of (re-)emerging human pathogenic viruses should be assessed based on research. For instance, foot-andmouth disease viruses were considered to be solely respiratory pathogens and therefore their potential as possible waterborne pathogens was disregarded. Not that these viruses display a major threat to the drinking water supply or human health but animal health is endangered and at least the risk should be assessed instead of hypothesised. Recently this has received a great deal of attention for the emerging disease SARS: the associated coronavirus was evaluated with respect to possible shedding and transmission routes including water. The same is true for avian influenza viruses which occasionally infect humans from their animal reservoirs mostly by close contact; the potential risk of waterborne transmission was estimated (WHO, 2006b) . Theoretically, viruses could be considered as biocolloids with specific properties such as size, shape, structure, charge, composition, genome, etc. These viral characteristics determine their behaviour in the environment, resistance to natural inactivation and treatment and disinfection processes. For each (re-)emerging virus these properties may be known or could be assessed predicting the effectiveness of possible intervention measures for prevention of waterborne disease. In this respect, free data sharing among researchers and risk managers in times of emergencies and disasters as encouraged by WHO is one of the keys to successful reduction of the environmental spread of pathogenic viruses and reduced burden of water-transmitted viral disease.",
