Different lineages of echovirus 30 have been linked to geotemporally distinct outbreaks [7] [8] [9] . This is the first report of echovirus 30 infection associated with orchitis, although it has been reported with other enteroviruses. Relatively few infectious agents have been described to present with both orchitis and meningitis (Table 1) . Although it is interesting to speculate that the strain we identified may possess characteristics associated with testicular tropism, we were unable to formally assess this possibility because the virus examined was from CSF and not testicular tissue. It is also possible, although unlikely, that the patient experienced 2 distinct infections, first with mumps or another pathogen causing orchitis, and subsequently with enterovirus causing meningitis.",

Metagenomic sequencing has also been used to sequence viral genomes from brain tissue [12, 13] , sometimes requiring the use of additional methods such as PCR amplification to obtain full genomes [14, 15] . Our results extend these methods by demonstrating the first assembly of a viral genome from CSF using metagenomic sequencing. Therefore, metagenomic sequencing offers the opportunity to aid not only in diagnosis but also in molecular epidemiology of viruses causing central nervous system infection. Finally, this case illustrates the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis in the setting of a known viral outbreak, including uncommon presentations of common infections.",

(B) The VP1 sequence identified in this study (Patient USA 2016, labeled in red) clusters with echovirus 30 sequences (labeled in light blue).

In both trees, branches are named with the enterovirus subtype and location and date of sequence acquisition (clinical samples) or name of reference strain (viral isolates), as well as GenBank accession number. Trees were constructed with 1000 bootstrap replicates, and nodes with at least 80% support are labeled with percent bootstrap support.",
