            "text": "Failure of passive transfer is a common problem in calves destined for veal production. At present it is unknown whether the risk for respiratory disease (BRD) or neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD) in the veal herd is associated with total immunoglobulin (Ig) and/or on the serostatus for respiratory pathogens measured at arrival. Therefore, the first objective of this prospective longitudinal cohort study was to determine associations between serum protein fractions as determined by routine electrophoresis (total protein, albumin, alpha-1 and -2 globulins, beta-globulins and Ig's) at arrival and BRD and NCD in the first 3 weeks of the production cycle. The second objective was to determine whether the serostatus (seropositive/seronegative) of seven respiratory pathogens (bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenzavirus-3, bovine coronavirus (BCV), bovine herpesvirus-1, bovine viral diarrhea virus, Mannheimia haemolytica and Mycoplasma bovis) of these arrival serum samples could be associated with the risk of having BRD. The third objective was to determine which of the electrophoresis proteins and respiratory serostatuses were associated with average daily gain (ADG) in the study period. The study population consisted of 150 ros\u00e9 veal calves housed in a single air-space. The study period ended at day 18 post arrival, when BRD incidence was judged to be too high to further postpone a group treatment. A Cox regression model was used to determine the effect of the studied protein fractions and antibodies on the time to BRD and NCD occurrence. The effect of the studied predictors on ADG was determined by linear regression. Calves with Ig levels under 7.5 g/L had an increased BRD hazard (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2-3.0)). NCD was only positively associated with the alpha-2 globulin concentration. Calves with a negative serostatus for BCV (HR = 1.7 (95% CI = 1.0-2.8)) or BRSV (HR = 2.0 (95% CI = 1.0-3.9)) had an increased BRD hazard. Average daily gain (ADG) was 0.242 kg/day (SD = 0.142) and was not related to the occurrence of BRD or NCD. Calves with Ig's below 7.5 g/L and with increased levels of alpha-2 globulins showed a decrease in ADG. This study showed the importance of providing sufficient colostrum to veal calves and the potential benefit of the presence of BCV and BRSV antibodies at arrival to reduce the BRD hazard in the first 3 weeks.",

            "text": "Selection of calves based on disease risk and subsequently targetting metaphylactic antimicrobial treatment toward the high risk batches, is one potential strategy to rationally reduce antimicrobial consumption. Calf selection parameters include age at arrival, body weight, infection status for bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), presence of disease (umbilical infection, bovine respiratory disease (BRD) or neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD)) (Wilson et al., 2000) and sufficient uptake of colostrum (Gulliksen et al., 2009; Brscic et al., 2012; Pardon et al., 2013) . Failure of passive transfer (FPT) shows a prevalence ranging between 20 and 80% in the United States (McDonough et al., 1994; Wilson et al., 2000; Stilwell and Carvalho, 2011) . Also in Belgium on average 40% of veal calves had FPT, assuming that immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels lower than 10 g/L upon arrival indicate colostral deficiency (Pardon, 2012) . The crucial role of sufficient IgG uptake in protecting calves from BRD, NCD and mortality has been evidenced on multiple occasions (Postema and Mol, 1984; Furman-Fratczak et al., 2011; Stilwell and Carvalho, 2011 ). These effects have been shown to last up to 3 months for BRD (Virtala et al., 1996) . To evaluate colostrum uptake, several tests have been validated for healthy animals in the age category of 2-7 days (Weaver et al., 2000) . Although that cheap indirect screening tests, such as determination of total protein (TP) with a refractometer, perform reasonably well, direct determination of immunoglobulins (Ig) or IgG is generally more specific (Weaver et al., 2000) . In calves sampled within a week after birth a cut off value for IgG of 10 g/L is generally accepted to determine FPT, and has been linked with disease occurrence, although some studies reported higher cut-offs in particular situations (Waldner and Rosengren, 2009; Furman-Fratczak et al., 2011; Stilwell and Carvalho, 2011) . In contrast, it is currently unknown whether Ig levels measured at the age of arrival in veal calves (2-4 weeks old) can be used as predictors of BRD or NCD. For the veal sector it would be interesting to identify, through testing of calves upon arrival, individual calves requiring an adapted treatment and herds of origin with an insufficient colostrum management.",

Study calves were housed on slatted floors in the same air-space. During the first 6 weeks calves were housed individually in metal framed pens, with 1.4 m 2 floor surface and an air volume of 9.0 m 3 per calf. After this period the metal framework was removed and the animals were kept in groups of 6 animals for the remaining of the raising period. The study compartment was physically isolated from the other calf units present at the farm by full walls and a separate ventilation system. The stable was mechanically ventilated at a 20% refreshing rate and temperature was maintained at 17 \u2022 C. Calves were fed a 21.2% crude protein (CP), 17.7% crude fat (CF) milk replacer (MR) diet at dry mater base.

Two Cox proportional hazards models (PROC PHREG) were built, with respectively NCD and BRD as outcome variable using Breslow ties. In each model, 7 predictors, being the 6 protein fractions (TP, albumin, A1g, A2g, Bg and Ig) and body weight at arrival as a potential confounder were evaluated. Calves arrived in three batches and in order to correct for clustering, arrival batch was added as fixed effect. Predictors were tested univariably both continuously as categorically, based on quartiles. If a significant effect was noted in one of the quartiles, a binary variable was constructed. The time between arrival and occurrence of NCD or BRD was defined as survival time and disease (either BRD or NCD) as the event. Censoring occurred at day 18, when the study ended, for each animal remaining undiseased. The model building procedure was as follows. First all predictors were tested univariably, and those with P < 0.20 were selected for multivariable modeling. The final multivariable model was built stepwise backwards, excluding non-significant variables. Next, all biologically relevant two-way interactions of significant fixed effects were tested. Significance was set at P < 0.05 and P < 0.10 was considered a trend. Wald's test was used to assess parameter estimate significance.

Given the intensive daily monitoring it was no surprise to find a much higher BRD incidence (60% in the first three weeks) compared to previously reported figures in white veal calves over the complete production cycle (Brscic et al., 2012; Pardon et al., 2012b) . Also for NCD the cumulative incidence in the present study was three times higher than previously reported (Pardon et al., 2012b) . These observations confirm that disease incidence is masked in practice due to the administration of antimicrobial group treatments. Given the very similar prevalence of FPT in the present study compared to previous work in Europe and the US, and because of the systematic presence of all respiratory pathogens in veal herds (Wilson et al., 2000; Pardon et al., 2011; Pardon, 2012) , the study most likely has a good external validity for the veal sector. In previous studies on maternal Ig in calves, radial immunodiffusion is mentioned as the gold standard assay for IgG determination. This test is expensive in contrast to electrophoresis or refractometry to be used at large scale in the veal industry. Therefore the authors opted to use serum electrophoresis to determine the concentration of Ig's, a test which is used routinely in many veterinary diagnostic laboratories all over Europe. At the age of 3 weeks, the Ig fraction consists for the vast majority of IgG (95%), and therefore results obtained by electrophoresis are highly similar to those from tests which only determine IgG (Burton et al., 1989) .",

This observation is in contrast with previous studies which could not evidence such an association (Postema and Mol, 1984;  Postema et al., 1987) . The most likely explanation for this difference is suboptimal disease expression and thus detection by the administration of antimicrobial group treatments in previous studies. Whereas in the present study the optimal cut-off to predict BRD in veal calves is 7.5 g/L, previous studies used 10 g/L as cut off. Maternal antibodies quickly decline after birth and normal IgG range for healthy calves, which have received enough colostrum, is reported to be between 10 and 15 g/L at the age of 2-3 weeks (Hassig et al., 2007) . Therefore, it is not illogical that calves with FPT have levels below 10 g/L at the age of 2-3 weeks. Calves with Ig < 7.5 g/L had a substantial higher BRD hazard and according to Berge et al. (2005) animal welfare might be compromised when no antimicrobials are administered to this group at arrival. However, since only 26% of the calves were involved, group treatment does not comply with prudent use of antimicrobials. Also, for example in the Netherlands and Belgium, prophylactic administration of antimicrobials is forbidden or strongly discouraged, respectively.",

The observed association between Ig levels, measured at the age of 2-3 weeks, and BRD is also interesting for conventional dairy and beef farming. It enlarges the window in which calves can be tested for FPT up to the third week of life, facilitating routine checking of FPT in a herd. In this context it is important to emphasize that measurement of TP, the cheapest option, is no longer useful at the age of 2-3 weeks in contrast to in the first days of life. In calves aged 2-3 weeks albumin concentration has increased, decreasing the proportion of Ig's in TP, and this might explain absence of a significant association of TP and disease (Mohri et al., 2007) . Also the well-known influence of hydration status and protein loss by various causes (e.g. diarrhea) on TP levels (Weaver et al., 2000) might have played a role as some animals were already diseased at testing or shortly thereafter.",

There was however a significant association of NCD with increasing levels of alpha-2 globulin.

It is not unlikely, that in cohorts in which another virus predominates, a seronegative status for that particular virus will be a risk factor.

Possible applications of screening veal calves at arrival might be the identification of herds of origin with a poor colostrum management or classification of calves according to BRD risk to target antimicrobial treatment. For practical use, an Ig cut-off of 7.5 g/L is recommended. The other protein fractions determined by routine electrophoresis, including TP, did not display any association of direct practical use. Secondly, calves seronegative for BCV and BRSV at arrival had an increased BRD risk in the first 3 weeks of the production cycle. Therefore, assuring a seropositive status for these viruses either by vaccination on the farm of origin or by provision of colostrum from a vaccinated cow might be an appropriate approach to reduce the BRD risk and subsequently prudent antimicrobial use in the veal calf sector.",
