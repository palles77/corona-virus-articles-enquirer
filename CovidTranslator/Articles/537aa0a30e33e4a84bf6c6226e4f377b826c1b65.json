Given potential risks of infection during the outbreak of severe infectious diseases, the need for a full understanding of its mechanism and protective measures within the field of epidemiology and engineering becomes pressing. This review paper considers progress achieved in existing studies of the concerned issue regarding different research priorities. Considerable progress in observing and modeling the inter-flat transmission and dispersion under either buoyancy-or wind-dominated conditions has been made, while fully understanding the combined buoyancy and wind effects is not yet possible. Many methods, including on-site measurements, wind tunnel tests and numerical simulations, have contributed to the research development, despite some deficiencies of each method. Although the inter-flat transmission and dispersion characteristics can be demonstrated and quantified in a time-averaged sense to some extent, there are still unanswered questions at a fundamental level about transient dispersion process and thermal boundary conditions, calling for further studies with more advanced models for simulations and more sound experiments for validations.",

Poor IAQ may cause various health problems leading to morbidity, disability, disease, or even death [4, 5] . In addition to indoor contaminant sources, incursion of outdoor pollutants through ventilation or infiltration is another significant factor in IAQ [5] , especially for natural ventilation through open windows in residential buildings [6] . Meanwhile, many new environmental problems has emerged in densely populated areas because of the increasing presence of high-rise residential (HRR) buildings, even though the housing problem is solved to some extent [7] . A good understanding of the mechanism and characteristics of airborne pollutant transmission and dispersion in and around the building is thus the perquisite for architects and building managers to employ effective indoor air pollution control strategies [8] , particularly during the outbreak of severe infectious diseases.",

On the other hand, smaller-scale SARS clusters occurred in several other HRR buildings, such as in Wing Shui House and Hing Tung House [23] , where the most affected households were located along the same vertical blocks on different floors. Similar case can also be observed in Germany [24] , and it is common for residents to detect the cooking odors from neighbors. Based on these facts, Niu et al. [25] first proposed the possible transmission of inter-flat air crosscontamination under the condition of single-sided natural ventilation through openings. Such single-sided case usually exists in densely occupied residential buildings where there may be only one open window for one small cellular room. This inter-flat transmission and dispersion, driven by wind turbulence and/or temperature differences between indoor and outdoor air, may be a valid route due to the short dispersion distances between flats and the large openings involving considerable airflow exchanges.",

The rationality of tracer gas technique has been discussed by many researchers considering the size and behavior of respiratory droplet nuclei [12,13,30,41e43] . In the early time, Duguid [42] revealed that the respiratory droplet nuclei commonly range from 1 to 2 mm in diameter. Recently, a review by Morawska [43] pointed out that viruses are usually between 0.02 and 0.3 mm in diameter, and simulations by Gao et al. [30] suggested that the aerosols with diameters less than 2.5 mm act like gaseous pollutants. Besides, the evaporation of droplet with an initial diameter smaller than 20 mm can be treated as an instantaneous process [12, 43] . Generally, small aerosols may suspend in air for long periods, transport over great distances, and deposit in the lower respiratory tract [13, 14] , which will cause significantly negative effects on human health. Considering these findings, it is supported that the coagulation, reflection, re-suspension and phase-change of small pathogens-carrying particles can be ignored in the dispersion of droplet nuclei.",

When the indoor and outdoor air temperatures equalize, the pressure difference is nearly zero and thus no driving force is produced for ventilation.

Based on the analysis of the meteorological information from the nearby stations of the building with SARS clusters, low wind speeds (<3 m/s) can be observed, especially during evening and dawn time (around 0.1 m/s) [26] . Such windless case indicates that the buoyant plume is the dominant driving force for building ventilation. Besides, local residents are likely to open windows for night-time cooling instead of using air conditioners during that season. In view of these facts, Niu et al. [25] first proposed the hypothesis that on windless days, the warm airflow escaping from the upper part of the window in the lower floor may mix with outdoor fresh airflow and partially re-enter the lower part of the window in the upper floor, as shown in Fig. 2 . A further hypothesis was also proposed by Niu et al. [25] that for multi-storey HRR buildings, there exists a \"cascade\" inter-flat flow starting from the lower floor and ending at the top floor when buoyancy effects dominate (Fig. 2) .",

Unfortunately, nearly no attention has been paid to the fate of the exhaust air with respect to the reentry possibility. In particular, pure buoyancy-driven single-sided natural ventilation through a lower and upper opening in a three- storey building was simulated by Allocca et al. [57] , who found that the indoor temperature level in each flat increased slightly with height, although the flats were physically and thermally isolated from one another. They related such phenomenon with the outside thermal plume from the openings underneath. However, this kind of vertical cascade effect was not further discussed in their study, and the potential transmission path was not mentioned either. Since the vertical transmission hypothesis was proposed, increasing consideration has been taken into the concerned issue by many researchers recently [25e30], as elaborated in Table 1 . It can be seen that, despite various assumptions and purposes in these studies, the possible transmission path has been demonstrated qualitatively and quantitatively. An indoor contaminant source at a lower flat can be a considerable contributor to concentrations in the vertical adjacent upper flat under certain meteorological conditions. In general, both on-site measurements [26] and numerical simulations [29] have revealed that, when buoyancy effects dominate, the re-entry ratio of exhaust air from a lower flat to the adjacent upper flat can reach up to about 7%. This is equivalent to an infectious risk of nearly 2% according to the WellseRiley model, based on an assumed condition made by Gao et al. [29] . Fig. 3 shows the mass fractions of tracer gas at a lower and adjacent upper room in a slab-like building with various indoor/ outdoor air temperature differences, obtained from Niu and Tung [26] and Liu et al. [28] . In spite of different assumed conditions and definitions of the resulting mass fractions, both experimental and simulation studies have found that the concentration level is generally lower by about two orders of magnitude in the upper room than in the lower room. Similar results can also be observed from Gao et al. [30] , who further investigated the dispersion of expiratory aerosols in such case through Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches. In addition, as the temperature difference increases Standard k-\u03b5 model Both tracer gas measurement and preliminary CFD simulation results well supported the hypothesis that a vertical upward movement of fine droplets is possible on windless days.",

As for a multi-storey HRR building, the cascade transport driven by buoyant plumes has not been studied and discussed either. Besides, for the existing CFD simulations, the airflow field was generally obtained based on steady-state models with heat released constantly from the internal walls, while the buoyancy-driven natural ventilated flows are inherently unsteady [30] . Thus, more sophisticated modeling, including the location of heat source, is needed to provide more accurate predictions, which is expected to be explored in the future.",

Fig. 4 shows the general airflow pattern around a bluff body, which has been thoroughly examined by many researchers [58, 59] . As wind impinges a building, airflow separates at building edges, generating recirculation zones over downward surfaces and extending into the downwind wake. The flow pattern near the windward wall is divided into three regions: a front stagnation region at about two-third of the building height, an upward separation region above it, and a downward vortex region below it. At leeward walls, a kind of vertical vortices is formed with a general flow direction from bottom to top. In general, various flow patterns, such as impingement, separation, reattachment, recirculation, vortex-shedding, etc., are involved along the building surface. Therefore, unlike the unidirectional transmission process in the buoyancy-dominated case, the wind-driven inter-flat transmission behaviors can be varied depending on the pollutant source location and the contaminant concentration distribution along the building surface.",

When the gaseous pollutant is released at the bottom flat, only lateral dispersions result. When the pollutant source is located below the stagnation zone, most momentum is transferred to the vertical and oblique downward flows. The pollutant is thus carried to the lower region, leading to larger reentry ratios for lower flats, as shown in Fig. 6(a) . When the pollutant is emitted in the stagnation region, dispersions in all directions can be observed, while the downward and lateral cases dominate. When the pollutant source is located at the top flat, the pollutant directly disperses downstream and may not re-enter other flats due to the upward flow. Generally, the pollutant disperses mainly downwards on the windward side under a normal incident wind. For a normal wind (0 ) on the leeward side, the flow pattern is generally characterized by a large building-height recirculation flow and a small corner recirculation flow near the bottom floor, as shown in Fig. 5(b) . The pollutant generated from the bottom floor can only affect the lowest floors. When the pollutant is emitted from the middle floors, it will disperse around all adjacent upper flats before entering the main downstream, causing a large scope of contamination and a high risk of infection, as shown in Fig. 6(b) . Finally, the pollutant from the top floor can be directly diluted by the upward flow on the leeward side and the horizontal flow from the upstream, indicating a very low possibility of re-entry into The main dispersion routes always vary with time, implying that the incursion of pollutants into a specific unit is intermittent; Secondary dispersions are observed; For pre-stable periods, the timescales ofa unit are influenced negligibly by distance from the source unit and the approaching wind direction, which are generally shorter on the windward sides than the leeward sides; For dynamically stable periods,a unit witha very small mean re-entry ratio could occasionally experience very large re-entry ratios, and the presence of balconies helps shrink and broaden the infectious scope on the windward and leeward sides, respectively.",

The pollutant generated from upstream flats can be directly diluted without reentry due to the strong reverse flow. The pollutant dispersion in the middle flats is controlled by the upward, reverse and reattachment flows. As the height increases, the momentum of the reverse flow will gradually transferred to the reattachment flow in the horizontal direction, resulting in a general upward and oblique dispersion, as shown in Fig. 6(d) . Similar case can also be found when the pollutant is generated from downstream flats, where the pollutant is gradually diluted into the downstream with the increase of the building height, as shown in Fig. 6(d) .

The wind-dominated pollutant dispersion is studied by Ai et al. [37, 38] considering a wind speed of 1 m/s at roof height; The threshold used to exclude results is: re-entry ratio <0.1%. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) simulation studies [37, 38] . One reason for the difference may lie in the different building models. The two lateral boundaries of the reentrance area will confine the horizontal dispersion, resulting in a high concentration level. While there is no obstruction effect for either vertical or horizontal directions in the slab-like building. In addition, such difference may also be attributed to the distinct assumed conditions in these studies. The simulations were based on a complex and turbulent near-wall airflow field, presenting a real situation, while the wind tunnel tests were conducted using a simplified solid model. Therefore, different building types may experience different possibilities of inter-flat cross-contamination, calling for distinctive control strategies and ventilation measures as appropriate.",

The simultaneous effect of temperature and wind on the air exchange and ventilation process at an opening is very complicated, especially for the single-sided case. Although many experimental and numerical studies have been conducted to understand the single-sided natural ventilation driven by the combined buoyancy and wind effects regarding the airflow rate [57,72e76] , such understanding is yet limited for application. In particular, after the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, many researchers have tried to address the mechanisms of disease spread [20, 21, 26] . Nevertheless, it still remains unclear whether the buoyancy or wind effect played a more significant role. Hence, a full understanding of the single-sided natural ventilation under combined buoyancy and wind effects is extremely important to reveal the inter-flat airborne transmission mechanisms.",

Such ambiguity makes it hard to observe consistent trends and to deduce general airflow processes. Nevertheless, some encouraging results have been obtained from Allocca et al. [57] by tracking the velocity patterns through a room at a range of wind speeds, as shown in Fig. 8(b) . At a low wind speed (v 1 ), buoyancy effects dominate and drive air in through the lower part and out through the upper part. At a wind speed of v 2 (v 2 > v 1 ), such buoyancy effects diminish as the wind forces increase, resulting in a smaller airflow rate. When the wind speed increases to v 3 (v 3 > v 2 ), the wind forces become dominant and drive a counterclockwise flow. As the wind speed continues to increase (v 4 ), the wind forces further grow stronger and the buoyancy effects are nearly negligible. Similar changes between the wind-and buoyancydominated cases can also be observed in other studies [74e76], which further investigated the effects of indoor/outdoor temperature differences and opening conditions. Thus, it is important to note that the combined effect should be studied case by case due to the complicated interaction between related parameters.",

Firstly, wind may increase the intensity of outdoor turbulence and further increase the interfacial mixing between incoming and outgoing airstreams at the middle of the opening [75, 77] . Such mixing layer tends to increase the airflow rate. Secondly, the approaching wind speed profile may attenuate the net pressure difference across the opening, indicating a counteraction between wind and buoyancy forces [29, 75] . Thirdly, wind turbulent fluctuations may contain high frequency energy, which can reinforce the air exchange through the opening [78] .

            "text": "Despite the complexities of such effects, some preliminary results regarding the inter-flat cross-contamination have been obtained, as illustrated in Table 3 . Generally, it depends on the assumed condition whether the buoyancy forces or wind turbulences will dominate the dispersion process. Fig. 9 shows the re-entry ratio of the tracer gas from a lower flat to the adjacent upper flat in a slab-like building with various wind speeds, obtained from Niu and Tung [26] and Gao et al. [29] . In spite of the slight difference in their assumptions, some positive findings can be deduced from the comparison. Firstly, both studies have demonstrated the re-entry possibility, namely the inter-flat cross-contamination within the same building exactly exists no matter what physical effects drive the ventilation. Secondly, when the wind speed is extremely low or high, both results show the same order of magnitude in re-entry ratios, indicating that both experimental and numerical studies can quantitatively describe the consistent trends under buoyancy-or winddominated cases. Thirdly, when the buoyancy effect is comparable to the wind effect, a large discrepancy can be observed. Gao et al. [29] revealed that the wind may first reinforce the upward transport and then suppress such spread as the speed increases, while the on-site measurements by Niu and Tung [26] did not capture such reinforcing phenomenon. There are two explanations regarding this discrepancy in addition to the complexity of weak wind effects as discussed above. One reason may lie in the modeling simplification of real conditions. In the simulations, only the wind normal to the window with heat released constantly from the internal walls was taken into account by Gao et al. [29] , while the real airflow along the fa\u00e7ade was fairly turbulent and flow directions varied drastically, as reported by Niu Ona windless day the ratio of the SF6 concentration in the upper room to the lower room ranged from 2.9% to7%, depending on the locations, and the re-entry ratio was 4.8%; Outside wind speed, when increased from 0\u00c00.03 to 2.48 m/s, could lower the maximum concentration ratio to 3.6% and reentry ratio to 0.6%.",

The re-entry portions in various scenarios are reviewed and analyzed in Section 3. However, existing studies have not provided a general secure threshold for the re-entry ratio to quantitatively evaluate the infectious risk for a specific flat by this kind of cross-contamination. This is due to the diverse pathogen types and different physical conditions of susceptible people [40] . Although previous researchers [42, 86] have studied the possibility of causing disease by pathogens, the results are shown to be strongly case-dependent. When exposed to a certain concentration level of a specific pathogen, isolating infectors as early as possible is nevertheless an effective method to reduce exposure time and control infection.",

An airborne infection is caused based on the prerequisite that at least one quantum produced by an infector must remain airborne and survive to be inhaled by a susceptible person [9] . If the survival time of a pathogen is shorter than the time required for quantum accumulation in a target flat, the occupants in this flat are safe and thus need no protective measures. Unfortunately, many pathogens can survive airborne for long periods, such as 24 h for influenza viruses [87] , 7 days for SARS coronavirus [88] , etc., which are longer than the timescale of inter-flat dispersion. On the other hand, many factors may affect the survival time of a pathogen [9, 43] . To the authors' knowledge, the two timescales have not been systematically compared and analyzed to evaluate the infectious risk with the concerned inter-flat dispersion. Therefore, the need to analyze the two timescales for a specific pathogen is meaningful to obtain more accurate risk estimations in a certain built environment.",

A unidirectional dispersion with high concentration flows dominates, seeFig. 6(c), instead of the bilateral dispersion as found under normal wind direction. It is worth mentioning that special cases can be observed at the top or bottom floor, where the combination of the relatively weak sweeping flow and the corner recirculation near the roof or ground results in an upward or downward dispersion.
