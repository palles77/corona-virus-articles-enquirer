For VEE, 338 EIDD-2801 exerts its antiviral activity on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase leading 339 to error catastrophe by inducing an error rate of replication that surpasses the error 340 threshold allowed to sustain a virus population 11,12 .

Therefore, the NHC MOA would appear less likely to be affected by the RNA 343 proofreading activity encoded by the nsp14 exonuclease function that otherwise limits 344 misincorperation 41 . Here, we present data using Primer ID NGS, a state of the art deep 345 sequencing-based approach, to quantitate the frequency and identity of the mutational 346 spectra in the MERS-CoV genome in both drug treated primary human airway cells and 347 in mice at single genome resolution 25 . As CoV are positive sense RNA viruses that 348 replicate through a negative sense RNA intermediate, NHC incorporation as a \"C\" or a 349 \"U\" can occur in both polarities of RNA. Using Primer ID NGS, we found increased 350 nucleotide transitions (A to G, G to A, C to U, U to C) consistent with those reported 351 after influenza and VEE infections 11,12 . Under identical conditions, remdesivir did not 352 alter the mutation rate in MERS-CoV genomic RNA, supporting its reported mechanism 353 of action as a chain terminator of viral RNA synthesis 26 . In primary human lung cell 354 cultures and mice infected with MERS-CoV, the NHC mutation rates inversely 355 correlated with a reduction in infectious virus. In addition, we found a positive correlation 356 between increased mutation rates and the frequency of nonsynonymous mutations and 357 the degree of therapeutic efficacy in mice. To explore the potential off-target effect in 358 host mRNA which may contribute to drug toxicity, we also examined the impact of NHC 359 treatment on transcripts from the highly MERS-CoV induced interferon stimulated gene 360 15 (ISG15). While ISG15 is present in great abundance, an accumulation of mutations 361 was not observed in ISG15 in this model even at 500mg/kg dosing. These data also 362 support previous studies using RNAseq to demonstrate that the model coronavirus 363 MHV displayed increased mutation frequencies following NHC treatment in vitro 13 . All 364 together, these data strongly support the notion that EIDD-2801 and its active 365 there was any NHC induced cytotoxicity, Calu3 2B4 cells were plated and treated with 418 NHC only as described above. Cells were exposed to the same ten-point dilution series 419 created for the in vitro efficacy studies. As above, 0.05% DMSO-treated cells served as 420 our 0% cytotoxicity control. Wells without cells served as our 100% cytotoxic positive 421 control.

As the murine ortholog of 235 the MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), does not support viral binding 236 and entry, all in vivo studies were performed in genetically modified mice encoding a 237 murine DPP4 receptor encoding two human residues at positions 288 and 330 (hDPP4 238 288/330 mice) 15,28 . Similar to our SARS-CoV data (Supplementary Figure 3), all doses 239 of prophylactic EIDD-2801 (50, 150 and 500mg/kg) protected hDPP4 288/330 mice 240 from significant body weight loss (P = 0.03 to < 0.0001), lung hemorrhage (P = 0.01 to 241 <0.0001), and virus replication which was undetectable (P < 0.0001) regardless of drug 242 dose following intranasal infection with 5E+04 PFU mouse-adapted MERS-",

Thus, approximately 20% of the mutations observed in the -2hr and +12hr groups 292 resulted in a codon change and alteration of the nsp10 protein sequence. When 293 extrapolating our results from nsp10 to the entirety of the 30kb MERS-CoV genome, 294 EIDD-2801 likely causes between 15 (+24hr treatment) and 30 (-2hr treatment) 295 mutations per genome 10-20% of which result in amino acid coding changes. 296 Altogether, our data demonstrates that EIDD-2801-driven mutagenesis correlates well 297 with the reductions in viral load, strongly suggestive of an error catastrophe-driven 298 mechanism of action under therapeutic conditions. 299 300 Discussion 301 In the past 20 years, three novel human coronaviruses have emerged 29,30 . The 302 group 2b SARS-like CoV represent an existential and future threat to global health as 303 evidenced by the emergence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 and zoonotic SARS-like 304 bat CoV strains that can use human ACE2 receptors, grow well in primary human 305 airway cells and vary by as much as 25% in key therapeutic and vaccine gene 306 targets 8,31 . Thus, to address the current public health emergency of COVID-19 and to 307 maximize pandemic preparedness in the future, broad-based vaccines and 308 therapeutics, which are active against the higher risk RNA virus families prone to 309 emergence are desperately needed. 310 in vivo 15,16,21,31 . Currently RDV therapeutic efficacy is under investigation in 313 several human clinical trials in China, the United States and elsewhere 32 .

Here, we show that prophylactic and therapeutic 320 EIDD-2801 significantly reduced lung viral loads and improved pulmonary function in 321 mouse models of both SARS-and MERS-CoV pathogenesis. Although the 322 improvement in both SARS-and MERS-CoV outcomes diminished with the increase of 323 treatment initiation time, it is important to note that the kinetics of disease in mice are 324",

First, MERS-CoV binds the human receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) to 505 gain entry into cells and two residues (288 and 330) in the binding interface of mouse 506 DPP4 prevent infection of mice. We recently developed a mouse model for MERS-CoV 507 through the mutation of mouse DPP4 at 288 and 330 thus humanizing the receptor 508 (hDPP4) and rendering mice susceptible to MERS-CoV infection 28 . We performed all in 509 vivo studies with EIDD-2801 in equivalent numbers of 10-14 week old female and male 510 C57BL/6J hDPP4 mice.

Human airway epithelium cultures (HAE) were generated by 430 provision of an air-liquid interface for 6 to 8 weeks to form well-differentiated, polarized 431 cultures that resembled in vivo pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium 46 . .

Upon removing the second 438 PBS wash, 200 \u00b5L of viral inoculum (multiplicity of infection of (MOI) 0.5) was added to 439 the apical surface and HAE cultures were incubated for 3 hours at 37\u02daC. Viral inoculum 440 was then removed, and the apical surface of the cultures were washed three times with 441 500\u00b5L PBS and then incubated at 37\u02daC until 48 hours post infection (hpi). For all HAE 442 cultures, infectious virus produced was collected by washing the apical surface of the 443 culture with 100 \u00b5L PBS. Apical washes were stored at -80 \u02daC until analysis and titered 444 by plaque assay as previously described 16 . 445 446 qRT-PCR approach to assess cytotoxicity: Total RNA was isolated using the Zymo 447 Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep Kit (Zymo Research Corp., Irvine, CA, USA) according to the 448 manufacturer's directions. First-strand cDNA was generated using Superscript III 449 reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For quantification of 450 cellular markers of toxicity/apoptosis, real-time PCR was performed using commercially 451 validated TaqMan-based primer-probe sets (Supplementary Table 1) and TaqMan 452 Universal PCR Mix (Life Technologies). Results were then normalized as described 453 Primer ID and Deep Sequencing 456 Primer ID NGS is designed to specifically identify and remove RT-PCR mutations, while 457 facilitating highly accurate sequence determination of single RNA molecules, because 458 each cDNA is created with a barcoded degenerate primer (N10, 4 10 combinations) from 459 which Illumina indexed libraries are made. We used a multiplexed Primer ID library prep 460 approach and MiSeq sequencing to investigate the presence of mutations in the viral 461 genomes and murine mRNA. We designed cDNA primers targeting multiple regions on 462 the viral genome and murine mRNA, each with a block of random nucleotides (11 bp 463 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

A pre-amplification titration of templates was performed to 465 estimate the amount of template to use. We used SuperScript III to make cDNA with 466 multiplexed cDNA primers based on the regions to be sequenced. We used 41R_PID11 467 for the pilot sequencing and titration determination. For the MERS-CoV sequencing, we 468 multiplexed nsp10_PID11, nsp12_PID11 and nsp14_PID11 for the cDNA reaction; for 469 the murine mRNA sequencing, we used mixed primers of nsp10_PID11, ifit3_PID11,",
