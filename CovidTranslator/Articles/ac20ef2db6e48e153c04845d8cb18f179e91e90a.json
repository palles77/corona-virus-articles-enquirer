Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) gripped the world in 2003, spreading via air-links and throwing the global economy into disarray. As a practicing physician in Singapore, one of the first countries affected, I describe my first-hand account of my battle with this illness, how I acquired this illness in Singapore, and eventually quarantine in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. \u00aa 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. I vividly remember the time when I first saw the index patient with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Singapore. She had just returned from a shopping trip from Hong Kong. She was unwell on the last day of the trip while her travelling companion had been unwell earlier. Upon return, both eventually sought help at two different major hospitals in Singapore. The index patient was admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) on Saturday, (1st March 2003), and an infectious disease consult was sought on the following Monday. I was the infectious disease registrar-oncall that day for TTSH.",

At a much later time, I learnt that there were rumours of an 'infectious agent' in Guangdong province, and various diagnosis were offered included Chlamydia infection to avian influenza. She was nonetheless investigated, and managed as for atypical pneumonia.",

And again, I was presented with the same history of a young Singaporean woman with atypical pneumonia in a returning traveler from Hong Kong after shopping. The incredulous similarity unsettled me as I asked the referring consultant if we were talking about the same patient. With this new referral, both patients were immediately isolated and an alert was issued to the Ministry of Health, Singapore. This was to the credit of my consultant. It was an exceedingly busy day for me as I had to attend to new referrals, run an outpatient clinic, and subsequently draft a clinical summary of these two patients by the early evening. Needless to say, I didn't go home till it was very late that night. It was subsequently elucidated that these two individuals acquired the disease while staying in the same hotel in Hong Kong from an ill visitor from Guangdong Province. 1 The next day was the weekly scheduled infectious disease round in my practicing hospital, TTSH, where infectious disease physicians from the various public hospitals in Singapore would gather. Each public hospital (Singapore General Hospital, National University Hospital, and TTSH) would take turns to host the event that is held on all most Fridays of the month. At this opportunity, we presented our cases, and discussed our findings. As a group of Infectious Diseases Physicians, we had no inkling to the etiological cause. Nonetheless, the patients remained isolated.",

I had a huge sigh of relief with the firm belief that my diagnosis of dengue fever was further reaffirmed. At that point in time, I had yet to develop any respiratory symptoms. My wife and I telephoned a colleague in Singapore and we concurred to have a full blood count test done at the clinic the next day. The American physician we referred to by the hotel in New York was a board-certified travel physician. His associate examined me initially, and astutely identified crepitations on my right lung. A Chest X Ray demonstrated radiographic features of consolidation and a full blood count showed normal white cell count and platelets. The physician immediately made a diagnosis of atypical pneumonia and I was prescribed levofloxacin. He showed professional courtesy and offered me free samples. On my part, I made a decision to return home on the first flight out that evening. The physician tried to dissuade me as he felt I would recover in a few days.",

The Germans were clearly well-prepared for the scenario, having rehearsed this recently for a mock patient at the airport with a viral haemorrhagic fever. The hospital, Klinikum der Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit\u00e4t, and its staff, led by Professor Hans-Reinhard Brodt, was exceptional in delivering the best care possible to me.

I felt 'loved' by my friends. I was a staff of SGH, and was rotated to TTSH as part of the infectious diseases training programme. Despite the fact that I acquired the disease from another hospital, the CEO of Singhealth, the administrative group for SGH, Professor Ser Kiat Tan, announced publicly that he would pay the entire hospital bill. This settled my worries. Some time after my discharge, my employer was billed for my entire stay, including the quarantine charges. It was a large bill that I would never have been able to pay in a lifetime. Professor Tan made calls to me either personally or through his secretary. That offered a lot of hope for this patient.
