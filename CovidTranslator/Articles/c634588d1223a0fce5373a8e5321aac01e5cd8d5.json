Partial answer to the problem may be obtained from phylogenetic analysis of available genomes. We call a phylogenetic tree of different species of coronavirus including the human SARS-Cov a \"CoV Tree\" and that of different isolates of SARS-CoV a \"SARS Tree\". CoY trees have been constructed by maximal parsimony based on alignment of 405 nt of the CoY polymerase gene ORF Ib [l] , and in comparison with predicted amino acid sequences for 6 different proteins [2] . Besides the fact that SARS-CoV makes a separate group with respect to the other three known groups, the precise location of the SARS group remains ambiguous. SARS trees have been built for 5 iso-lates by aligning complete genomes [3] and for 14 isolates by maximal parsimony based on 16 sequence variations that occurred more than twice [4] . The interrelation ofvarious isolates remains largely uncertain. Moreover, since all SARS genomes sequenced so far are very close to each other, how to construct the SARS Tree requires special consideration. All said calls for a study on more species using an independent methodology. In particular, appropriate choice of an outgroup may provide further indication on where to locate the root of the trees.",

            "text": "As regards the SARS Tree the small size of SARS-CoV genome tempts one to align complete genomes for tree construction. However, the high similarity of sequences makes much of the alignment work redundant. In fact, there were only 42 single-letter variations in the first 12 SARS complete genomes (excluding ZJ01, BJ02-4 and GZ01). If one counts the variations among all genome pairs the number varies from 1 to 21. Taking the sequence error rate to be 1 in 10000 2 ), there might be 2-3 errors in each genome and 4-6 variations pairwise. Keeping only 16 sequence variations that occurred twice or more as did in [4] is a safe but overcautious approach because there must be single-occurrence variations that are real. If one further excludes the synonymous nucleotide variations these numbers drop from 42/16 to 27/13. Using maximal parsimony means keeping only 16 or 13 variations. Furthermore, the choice of outgroup becomes extremely difficult when all genomes for which we wish to resolve the interrelationship are very close to each other while the candidate outgroup is too distant because an improper outgroup may change the internal branchings in a significant way. In order to make use of all sequence variations at the cost of allowing some sequence errors and to avoid the outgroup problem we propose a new way of tree construction as follows. If one defines distance between any two species as the branch length to their connnon ancestor on an additive phylogenetic tree, the distance matrix is ultrametric[9 J \u2022 Conversely, we may take ultrametricity as a criterion to guide tree construction. A distance matrix derived in some way may not be ultrametric per se. However, starting from this matrix one may construct two ultrametric matrices which serve as lower and upper bounds to the original one. In between these two there exist infinitely many ultrametric matrices which may be obtained from the original one by performing various transformations. From these matrices we choose one that is closest to the original one in some well-defined sense as the optimal distance matrix. Starting from this matrix both Unweighted Pair-Group with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) or Neighbor-Joining (NJ) (see ref. [7] for these standard methods) would lead to identical trees. The \"ultrametrization\" has the additional advantage to yield a rooted tree without choosing an out- group. Actually, choosing an outgroup for the SARS Tree is not a feasible task because all G1 through G3 genomes are too far from the SARS-CoV as it is evident by inspecting the distance matrices. The method of clustering and tree-construction via ultrametrization of distance matrix was sketched in [8] . We implemented the algorithm and applied it to getting the SARS Trees. The method will be described in detail elsewhere and we only present the result in this paper.",

Fig. 2(a) and (b) are based on the most conserved data and tum out to be consistent except for the relocations of CUHKW. They both support the observation [4] that the SARS-CoV spreading process has split into two paths. So does the location of the root. In addition, our method also reveals some finer branches which could not be resolved by using maximal parsimony. We note that these finer branches are consistent with the clinic relations described in [4] .",

The origin of SARS-CoV cannot be revealed by phylogenetic study alone at present time as there are too few CoV species represented in GenBank. We must await more As mentioned above, when monophylic groups on a tree are too distant from each other the intra-group branchings may not be taken seriously as such. One must refer to trees built specially to resolve intra-group relations (see Fig. 2 in Subsection (ii)). The question on SARS origin cannot be answered by phylogenetic study alone as no genomes of close neighbors are present in GenBank for the time being. The only plausible conclusion that may be drawn from all CoV Trees constructed so far is SARS makes a separate group within the Coronavims genus. The outgroup added to our tree indicates that the SARS group is closer to G2, i.e. to some coronavimses in mammalian hosts. We mention in passing that the ultrametrization procedure applied to the CoV Tree without using any outgroup also puts the root exactly where the outgroup in Fig. 1 is located. ( ii) The SARS Tree. We first present four distance matrices obtained by counting sequence variations in all available SARS-CoV genomes. The upper right triangle of Table 2 gives pairwise distance by counting all instances of different characters in aligning two sequences (Hamming distance on 4-letter alphabet). There are 137 variations in total. Some nucleotide variations do not change the encoded amino acid if we adopt the Open Reading Frame definitions of the corresponding genome annotation. By excluding these synonymous variations we keep 97 variations shown in the lower left triangle of Table 2 . The numbers shown in Table 2 may contain some sequencing A phylogenetic tree for 20 coronviruses including 6 SARS-CoVs based on the composition vector method at string length K~5. Four viruses from Flaviviridae and Togaviridae are added as outgroup. Note that this is an unrooted tree and the branches are not to scale.
