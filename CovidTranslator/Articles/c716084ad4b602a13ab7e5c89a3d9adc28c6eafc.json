Both the fluorogenic assays showed high specificity, sensitivity and reproducibility, allowing a precise quantitation of CCoV type I and type II RNA over a linear range of about eight orders of magnitude (from 10 1 to 10 8 copies of standard RNA). Comparison with genotype-specific gel-based RT-PCR assays revealed that the fluorogenic assays were more sensitive and more rapid than conventional amplifications, with a large increase in throughput. The genotype-specific fluorogenic assays were then used to detect and measure viral loads in the faecal samples collected from dogs naturally or experimentally infected with type I, type II, or both genotypes. Of 174 samples collected from naturally infected dogs, 77 were positive for CCoV type I and 46 for CCoV type II. Thirty-eight dogs were found to be infected naturally by both genotypes, with viral RNA titres generally higher for type I in comparison to type II. At the same time, dogs infected experimentally shed type I RNA with higher titres with respect to type II.",

The CCoV genome is composed for about two-thirds of two large, partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode two polyproteins leading to the viral replicase formation. The 3 one-third of the genome consists of other ORFs encoding the structural proteins and the other non-structural ones. The structural proteins comprise the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins encoded by ORF2, ORF4, ORF5 and ORF6, respectively (Luytjes, 1995; Enjuanes et al., 2000) .",

Type I and type II are distinguishable by means of molecular methods, which are able to amplify selectively fragments of the ORF2 (S gene) and ORF5 (M gene) (Pratelli et al., 2002a , but no quantitative techniques have been developed which could differentiate the two genotypes. In addition, the established fluorogenic assay was able to detect both genotypes, although it tended to underestimate the viral load in dogs infected with type I, probably due to the presence of mismatches in the binding region of primers and probe (unpublished results). The simultaneous detection of both type I and type II in the faeces of pups with diarrhoea has highlighted the need to establish genotypespecific fluorogenic RT-PCR assays, in order to obtain an exact quantitation of the two genotypes present in the same samples. Such a method would be helpful for understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms of the newly recognized CCoV type I, since this virus has not yet been adapted to grow in vitro (Pratelli et al., 2003b .",

In fact, the total volume of faeces (and thus the volume into which the viruses are secreted or diluted) can hardly be determined and will vary between different dogs and between different periods of a diarrhoeic episode of one dog. In contrast with the high specificity of the two assays, TGEV was amplified successfully by the type II-specific fluorogenic assay.

            "text": "The CCoV genotype-specific fluorogenic assays have several advantages over conventional gel-based RT-PCR assays. They enable simultaneous processing of a large number of samples, with a substantial increase in throughput and a considerable time saving. The only disadvantage related to real-time RT-PCR is represented by the higher costs, which consist of the cost of conventional RT-PCR plus the cost of the labelled probe. Nevertheless, the high throughput associated with the TaqMan assay compensates for this additional cost and permits processing of multiple samples with minimal labour time and very low risks of carry-over contamination. The performance of the IC added to the faecal samples demonstrated that the commercial kit used for nucleic acid extraction is highly efficient for the recover and purification of RNA.",

Several dogs were infected simultaneously by both type I and type II, showing that dual CCoV infections are very frequent in the dog population, as reported previously . Interestingly, type I was found more widespread in the dog population with respect to type II. An analogous distribution has been also described for feline coronaviruses, since FCoV type I is more frequently detected in cats than FCoV type II (Hohdatsu et al., 1992; Benetka et al., 2004) , although it grows poorly in cell cultures (Pedersen et al., 1984) . Furthermore, the CCoV type I titres in the faeces were generally higher than those of type II. These findings were confirmed by the analysis of the specimens of the dogs infected experimentally, in whose faeces shedding of type I was observed with higher titres in comparison to type II. Nevertheless, the onset of a more severe diarrhoea in the dog infected with both genotypes seems to confirm previous observations of increased severity of the clinical course of dual CCoV infections with respect to that noticed in singlegenotype infections (unpublished results).",

Finally, vaccine trials against CCoV infections could also take advantage of the newly established fluorogenic assays for the evaluation of the vaccine efficacy by determining CCoV shedding in the faeces of vaccinated dogs after challenge with a field strain of type I or type II. In fact, by conventional RT-PCR only, the time duration of viral shedding is valuable, while evaluation of the vaccine efficacy should also take into account the reduction in the titres of the challenge virus in the faeces. Theoretically, CCoV type II titres in the faeces of challenged dogs could be evaluated by titration in cell culture, but it has been noted that this method is poorly sensitive and inaccurate and, further, virus titration cannot be used for CCoV type I which cannot be cultivated in cell culture.",
