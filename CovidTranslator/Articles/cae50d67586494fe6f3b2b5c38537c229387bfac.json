            "text": "Helicases unwind double-stranded nucleic acids, remove secondary structures from singlestranded nucleic acids, and remove proteins bound to nucleic acids. For many helicases, the mechanisms for these different functions share the ability to translocate with a directional bias as a result of ATP binding and hydrolysis. The nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) is an essential enzyme expressed by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and is known to catalyze the unwinding of both DNA and RNA substrates in a 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 direction. We investigated the role of nucleic acid binding in the unwinding mechanism by examining ATP-independent unwinding. We observed that even in the absence of ATP, NS3 helicase domain (NS3h) unwound duplexes only when they contained a 3\u2032tail (i.e., 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 directionality). Blunt-ended duplexes and 5\u2032-tailed duplexes were not melted even in the presence of a large excess concentration of the protein. NS3h was found to diffuse rapidly along single-stranded DNA at a rate of 30 nt 2 \u00b7s \u22121 . Upon encountering an appropriate single-strand/double-strand (ss/ds) junction, NS3h slowly melted the duplex under conditions with excess protein concentration relative to DNA concentration. When a biotin-streptavidin block was placed into the ssDNA region, no melting of DNA was observed, suggesting that NS3h must diffuse along the ssDNA, and that the streptavidin blocked the diffusion. We conclude that the specific interaction between NS3h and the ss/dsDNA junction, coupled with diffusion allows binding energy to melt duplex DNA with a directional bias. Alternatively, we found that the fulllength NS3 protein did not exhibit strict directionality and was dependent on duplex DNA length. NS3 was able to unwind the duplex even in the presence of the biotin-streptavidin block. We propose a non-canonical model of unwinding for NS3 in which the enzyme binds directly to the duplex via protein-protein interactions to melt the substrate. .

            "text": "Helicases are enzymes that manipulate nucleic acids by coupling the energy of ATP hydrolysis to protein conformational changes that unwind and/or translocate DNA or RNA. [1] [2] [3] [4] The mechanisms for these enzymes have received intense study over the past two decades. Different families of helicases have been identified based on sequence analysis. 5 Some helicases readily oligomerize into hexameric rings, while other helicases appear to function as monomers or dimers. 6 The non-structural protein 3 (NS3) from the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the most studied helicases from superfamily 2. It is of medical interest as a target for anti-viral drug development, but it also serves as an excellent model system for studying helicase mechanisms. 7 This enzyme is a multifunctional protein that contains a N-terminal protease domain and a C-terminal helicase domain. The domains can be separated while retaining each individual function, but helicase and protease activity are allosterically linked. 8 NS3 can interact with itself, but it also reportedly can function as a monomer. HCV is an RNA virus, so the biologically relevant substrate for NS3 is RNA. However, this enzyme readily functions on DNA as well, and some evidence indicates that NS3 can be observed in the nucleus of patients with HCV infection. 9 While nuclear DNA helicase II (SF2 helicase), vaccinia NPH II (SF2 helicase), and human coronavirus 229E (SF1 helicases) are also known to function on both nucleic acids, 10-12 most helicases, even very closely related SF2 enzymes (e.g. DENV NS3), typically only function on either DNA or RNA. 13 Studies on this enzyme have been conducted on both RNA and DNA substrates, and structural studies have demonstrated that the interactions made between NS3 and the two different nucleic acid structures are highly similar. [14] [15] [16] It is due to this lack of strict substrate specificity that NS3 is able to work on both substrates with similar but not identical kinetic parameters. 17, 18 The ability of helicases to unwind dsNA can be broken down into two functions: translocation and base pair melting. Translocation has been examined in depth through many approaches, resulting in models for stepwise movement of the enzymes along the nucleic acid lattice. 4, 6, 19 The helicase domain of NS3 (NS3h) has served as a model enzyme for studying translocation and base pair melting. In the case of NS3h, movement has been suggested to occur in one nt steps, driven by hydrolysis of one ATP. 20 An alternative model based on single molecule FRET experiments supports a \"spring-loaded\" mechanism in which the enzyme hydrolyzes ATP, building up strain through movement of subdomains along the DNA, then the enzyme releases the strain by springing forward while melting 3 base pairs. 21 The chemical mechanism for helicase-catalyzed base pair melting has received less attention than translocation. In previous studies, it has been shown that NS3 and NS3h bind tightly to the ss/ds junction causing destabilization of the duplex. 22 In the current study, we have examined unwinding of dsDNA in the absence of ATP in order to investigate the role of protein-DNA binding during the base pair melting process. Results indicate that NS3h readily diffuses along ssDNA, but interacts tightly with ss/dsDNA junction. A directional bias for unwinding of DNA is observed in the absence of ATP, which emphasizes the importance of the specific interaction between the enzyme and the ss/dsDNA junction. In the case of full-length NS3, directionally-biased melting is partially lost for ATP-independent melting of short duplexes which appears to be due to protein-protein interactions that are much stronger compared to the truncated NS3h protein.",

Duplexes were prepared by adding 1.2 equivalents of unlabeled oligonucleotide (bottom strand) to the radiolabeled oligonucleotide, followed by heating to 95 \u00b0C, then allowing slow cooling to room temperature. DNA substrates were stored in a solution buffer consisting of 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and 0.1 mM EDTA. Recombinant full-length NS3 was derived from the HCV replicon 1b replicon consensus sequence and expressed and purified as previously described. [23] [24] [25] ATP-Independent, Multiple Turnover Unwinding DNA unwinding assays are conducted by incubating a helicase with a radiolabeled duplex substrate and then initiating the reaction upon addition of ATP leading to formation of ssDNA. The presence of a nucleic acid (NA) trap that is complementary to the unlabeled strand of the substrate prevents reannealing of separated ssDNA products. Detection of these products is by autoradiography after native gel electrophoresis separates the ssDNA product from the dsDNA. The ATP-independent unwinding reactions were initiated by mixing 2 nM radiolabeled substrate with 500 nM NS3 or NS3h (final concentrations reported) at 37 \u00b0C after an initial pre-incubation period of 5 min to allow the solutions to reach the desired temperature prior to the reaction. The reaction was performed in 25 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM \u03b2ME, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, and 0.1 mM EDTA.

An aliquot of the quenched reaction mixture (20 \u03bcl) was added to 4 \u03bcl loading buffer (0.1% bromophenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 30% glycerol) and resolved on a native 20% polyacrylamide gel.

NS3h was unable to unwind the substrate with the 5\u2032-tail ( Figure 1D ). The requirement for a 3\u2032-oriented tail in this unwinding reaction is evidence for a directional bias inherent in the unwinding activity of NS3h, independent of ATP binding and hydrolysis.

The finding that NS3h requires the 3\u2032-ssDNA tail to melt substrates but is inactive on the 5\u2032-ssDNA tail in the absence of ATP suggests that the polarity of binding to ssDNA and recognition of the ss/ds junction is important in the unwinding reaction. Hence, a specific interaction between NS3h and the ss/dsDNA junction appears to mediate the melting reaction. Previously, Levine and Patel reported a junction specific interaction between NS3h and DNA substrates. 22 Results here suggest that binding to ssDNA alone is insufficient to melt the duplex, but if the binding to ssDNA is on the appropriate side of the ss/ds junction, duplex melting can occur.",

NS3h binds to the ssDNA and presumably it may diffuse or slide randomly along the DNA (Figure 2A ). To examine diffusional sliding of NS3h, a series of stopped-flow experiments were performed to measure dissociation of NS3h from oligonucleotides of increasing lengths (1.2 \u03bcM: T 8 , T 10 , T 13 , T 15 , T 18 , T 20 , T 30 , T 40 , and T 55 ). NS3h was incubated at 37 \u00b0C with the ssDNA followed by rapid mixing with a solution containing heparin (4 mg/mL), and the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of NS3h was measured over time ( Figure 2B ). Heparin serves as a protein trap to prevent the helicase from rebinding the ssDNA after the dissociation event. It also prevents any unbound NS3h in solution at the start of the reaction from binding to the ssDNA after the reaction begins. The observed rate of dissociation (k d,obs ), which encompasses the dissociation constant from internal positions along the ssDNA and the dissociation of the enzyme from the end of the oligonucleotide, is obtained by fitting the observed change in fluorescence to a single exponential ( Figure 2C ). If the enzyme diffuses along ssDNA, then it will dissociate from the end of the shorter DNA sequences faster than it dissociates from longer DNA sequences, which is exactly what we observed (Supplemental Figure 1) .",

For comparison, rates of 1-46 nt/s have been reported for ATP-dependent translocation by NS3h. 18, 31, 32 The more rapid dissociation constant from shorter oligonucleotides could be due simply to weaker binding to the shorter oligos, as reported previously, rather than diffusional sliding from the ends of the ssDNA. Levin and Patel 33 measured the affinity for oligonucleotides dT 7 , dT 10 , dT 12 , dT 15 , and dT 20 , with K d values of 47, 7.4, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.9 nM, respectively.

The presence of excess streptavidin in the unwinding reaction does not interfere with the ability of NS3h to unwind the substrate in the absence of the biotin-thymidine analogue (Supplemental Figure 2) .

Hence, the 3\u2032 \u2192 5\u2032 directionality for translocation that is driven by ATP hydrolysis prevents the melting reaction with the 5\u2032-tailed substrate.",

The surprising event in this reaction is that NS3h unwinds the duplex with a directional bias.

This idea was tested by placing a biotin label on the ssDNA so that in the presence of streptavidin, a block was present that prevents diffusional sliding into the junction. The presence of this protein block completely eliminated ATP-independent melting of the DNA substrate (Figure 3) . The presence of streptavidin did not prevent binding of NS3 to the substrate.

NS3h binds to the ssDNA tail, and the protein can diffuse off of the 3\u2032-end of the ssDNA or it can slide into the ss/dsDNA junction. Specific interactions between the displaced strand of the duplex strengthen the interaction between NS3h and the DNA. These interactions are depicted by the charge symbols in the diagram, but could be stacking or other interactions. Due to this new interaction, the direction of diffusion is now biased due to the additional interaction between one face of the enzyme and the displaced strand. Additional molecules of NS3h can bind to the ssDNA. These molecules can further add to the directional bias in diffusion by preventing the lead molecule from sliding back towards the 3\u2032-end. Thus, upon encountering the junction from the 3\u2032-side ( Figure 6A ), NS3h interacts specifically with the junction, melting 1-2 base pairs at a time, as reported previously 22 .

NS3 unwinds DNA duplexes via local strand separation in the absence of ATP (Figure 7) . This mechanism is similar to the unwinding mechanism utilized by a number of DEAD-box proteins, which is unlike the translocation-dependent canonical mechanism of unwinding. [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] We propose a model in which NS3 binds the ss extension portion of a partial-duplex substrate and loads additional molecules directly onto the duplex region due to protein-protein interactions, leading to separation of the strands in an ATP-independent manner. This protein binding and alignment between NS3 and DNA substrates was indicated by DNA footprinting experiments. 41 This interaction in the duplex not only leads to the separation of 3\u2032-tailcontaining substrates, but can also lead to the unwinding of 5\u2032-tail-containing substrates. This suggests that once a molecule of NS3 binds to ssDNA, near a ss/dsDNA junction, the other NS3 molecules can interact with the duplex correctly and separate the strands ( Figure  7) . The decrease in unwinding efficiency observed on the DNA substrate with the 5\u2032-tail ( Figure 4C ) is likely due to the binding polarity displayed by NS3 and the lack of appropriate interaction with the ss/dsDNA junction. Strand separation by NS3 is limited by the duplex length further indicating a different mechanism for NS3 compared to NS3h. We suggest that diffusion of NS3 is limited due to the oligomeric nature of the enzyme, which limits the length of duplex that can be melted in the absence of ATP. Diffusional sliding was recently investigated and found to be important for NS3. 45 However, these investigators examined RNA rather than DNA. NS3 is capable of melting both RNA and DNA, but clearly differences can be observed for each substrate.",

            "text": "Our results point to an intriguing diffusion property shared by some helicases, but not others. Helicase unwinding assays are typically performed by incubating the helicase with the DNA or RNA substrate prior to addition of ATP. During the incubation time, some helicases assemble into a functional complex. 46 Other helicases appear to achieve functional status more rapidly such as the case with Dda, 47 Pif1, 48 and PcrA, 49 for example. For those enzymes that assemble rapidly, it is curious that little or no melting of short duplexes occurs during the incubation period. This observation implies that these enzymes may not diffuse or may not recognize the ss/ds junction in the same manner as NS3h. Lack of diffusion may be due to the nature of the interactions between helicases and nucleic acid. We suggest that enzymes that do not diffuse readily contain binding sites in which one or more bases are \"flipped\" out of the normal, stacked position, into a specific helicase binding site. In the case of PcrA, base flipping clearly occurs. 50 Base flipping is also proposed to occur in Dda. 51 No evidence for base flipping exists in the case of NS3h, despite numerous x-ray crystallographic structural studies. 15, 16 Use of ATP-independent unwinding assays may be a simple way to distinguish enzymes that readily diffuse from those that do not. Recent work from the Lohman laboratory characterized diffusion of the human SSB, hRPA. Interestingly, hRPA uses diffusion to unwind duplex DNA more efficiently from ssDNA on the 5\u2032 side of a hairpin. 52 In summary, we report a surprising property of NS3h: directionally biased melting of dsDNA in the absence of ATP. This result emphasizes the importance of specific interactions between the enzyme and the ss/dsDNA junction. Bi-directional diffusion of NS3h on ssDNA appears to be rapid, and contributes to the observed melting.",

A model for diffusion of NS3h along a 8mer oligonucleotide. NS3h binds 6 nt based on the crystal structure. Each step of diffusional sliding (k s ) is shown in one direction, but actually can occur with equal probability in both directions. Sliding is assumed to occur in increments of one nt. Dissociation from the end of the DNA was estimated to occur in three individual steps, which allows half the six sites of interaction to dissociate.

A representative progress curve from dissociation of 200 nM NS3h from 1.2 \u03bcM strands T 8 upon rapid mixing with 4 mg/mL heparin. The data was fit to a single exponential to obtain an observed dissociation rate (k d,obs ) of 11.4 \u00b1 0.8 s \u22121 . D. The k d,obs rates obtained for different lengths of ssDNA are plotted ( ). E. The rates of dissociation from oligonucleotide that display a lengthdependence (T 8 , T 10 , T 13 , T 15 , T 18 ) were used to determine the rate of sliding. The sliding rate (k s ) was determined via analysis of the linear regression fit of the observed dissociation rates plotted versus the equation describing diffusion along a linear polymer. 26 The k s of NS3h along ssDNA in the absence of ATP binding and hydrolysis was determined to be 30 nt 2 /s ( ). ATP-independent unwinding by NS3h is halted by the presence of a protein block that prevents sliding into the duplex. A. The streptavidin block was created by incubating 2 nM DNA substrate containing a biotin-thymidine analogue (pink) at position 12 with 120 nM streptavidin (black tetramer) at 37\u00b0C prior to initiating the ATP-independent unwinding reaction. The streptavidin-blocked DNA substrate was mixed with 500 nM NS3h (orange) to initiate the ATP-independent unwinding reaction. B. The presence of streptavidin ( ) halted NS3h unwinding of the biotinylated substrate, T 15(bio\u00b7dT-12) -22 bp. NS3h was able to unwind this substrate in the absence of streptavidin ( ). ATP-independent unwinding by NS3 is unaffected by the presence of a large protein block. The reaction was conducted as shown in Figure 3A . The ATP-independent unwinding reaction was initiated by mixing the streptavidin-blocked DNA substrate with 500 nM NS3. The presence of streptavidin ( ) did not stop NS3 unwinding T 15(bio\u00b7dT-12) -22 bp. In the absence of the streptavidin block, NS3 unwinds this substrate ( ) similarly to the substrate in the absence of the biotin-thymidine analogue ( Figure 4A ). Model for DNA unwinding by NS3h in the absence of ATP. A. NS3h binds a substrate and can diffuse along the ssDNA tail region (indicated with a black arrow). Upon engaging the ss/ds junction, additional interactions occur that add stability to the complex, thereby favoring this species. Additional NS3h molecules can also bind to the cleared ssDNA tail. The trailing protein can also favorably interact with the displaced strand, leading to diffusion with an apparent directional bias. This results in the separating of base pairs in the 3\u2032 \u2192 5\u2032 direction and eventually full strand separation. B. NS3h bound the 5\u2032-tail does not form specific interactions with the ss/ds junction, therefore it is unable to unwind a DNA substrate containing a 5\u2032-tail. ATP-independent unwinding of DNA substrates is mediated by an oligomeric form of NS3. A. Multiple molecules of NS3 (protease domain shown in green, helicase domain in orange) are capable of binding both the ssDNA tail and duplex regions of a substrate. 41 Preferential binding of NS3 to the junction properly aligns the oligomer to optimally interact with the duplex leading to direct separation of base pairs in the duplex. NS3 is capable of disrupting a sufficient number of base pairs such that duplex lengths of 22 bp can separate at 37 \u00b0C. B. On a substrate containing a 5\u2032-tail, protein-protein interactions guide NS3 to bind to the duplex region, after initial binding to the ssDNA, which leads to melting of the duplex. C. ATP-independent unwinding of DNA substrates by NS3 oligomer is length-dependent. Slightly longer duplexes are sufficiently stable to remain intact despite binding and melting of some of the dsDNA. ",

ATP-independent unwinding was initiated by mixing 500 nM NS3h with 2 nM DNA in the presence of 10 mM MgCl 2 at 37 \u00b0C ( ). A. An unwinding assay is performed on a radiolabeled duplex substrate with or without a single-stranded extension. The action of a helicase unwinds the duplex resulting in two separate DNA strands. A trapping strand that is complimentary to the unlabeled displaced strand is placed in the quench of an ATP independent unwinding assay to prevent reannealing. B. The DNA substrate, T 15 -22 bp, featuring a ssDNA 3\u2032-ssDNA tail made up of 15 thymidine residues was unwound by NS3h ( ). The data was fit to a single exponential resulting in an observed rate of unwinding of 0.033 \u00b1 0.004 min \u22121 . To ensure the efficiency of the protein trap, 100 \u03bcM nt poly(U) was pre-incubated with the DNA then mixed with enzyme (\u25cb) to begin the unwinding reaction. C. NS3h was also able to unwind a DNA substrate of 30 bp, T 15 -30 bp ( ). The data was fit to a single exponential to obtain the observed unwinding rate of 0.029 \u00b1 0.003 min \u22121 . D. NS3h was unable to unwind a DNA substrate containing a 5\u2032-ssDNA tail adjacent to the 22 bp duplex (22 bp-T 15 ) ( ). E. NS3h was unable to unwind a blunt-ended DNA substrate comprised of only the 22 bp duplex.",

ATP-independent unwinding was initiated by mixing 500 nM NS3 with 2 nM DNA at 37 \u00b0C. A. The DNA substrate, T 15 -22 bp, featuring a ssDNA 3\u2032-tail was unwound by NS3 ( ). The data was fit to a single exponential resulting in an observed rate constant of 0.05 \u00b1 0.01 min \u22121 . To ensure the efficiency of the protein trap, 100 \u03bcM nt poly(U) was pre-incubated with the DNA then mixed with enzyme (\u25c7) to begin the unwinding reaction. B. NS3 was unable to unwind a DNA substrate featuring a duplex length of 30 bp ( ). C. NS3 was able to unwind a DNA substrate containing a 5\u2032-tail adjacent to the 22 bp duplex (22 bp-T 15 ) ( ). This data was fit to a single exponential resulting in an observed rate constant of 0.02 \u00b1 0.01 min \u22121 . D. NS3 Biochemistry. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 November 16.",
