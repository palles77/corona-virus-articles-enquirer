Methods: A join-count spatial statistic study was conducted and the given hypothetical processes of the spread of SARS in Beijing were tested using various definitions of 'joins'. Results: The spatial statistics showed that of the six diffusion processes, the highest negative autocorrelation occurred in the doctor-number model (M-5) and the lowest negative autocorrelation was found in the population-amount model (M-3). The results also showed that in the whole 29-day research period, about hour or more days experienced a significant degree of contagion. Conclusions: Spatial analysis is helpful in understanding the spatial diffusion process of an epidemic. The geographical relationships were important during the early phase of the SARS epidemic in Beijing. The statistic based on the number of doctors was significant and more informative than that of the number of hospitals. It reveals that doctors were important in the spread of SARS in Beijing, and hospitals were not as important as doctors in the contagion period. People are the key to the spread of SARS, but the population density was more significant than the population size, although they were both important throughout the whole period.",

If the values display interdependence over space, the data are spatially autocorrelated. A detailed discussion of spatial autocorrelation has been given by Cliff et al. 7 . In public health, professionals often face the task of investigating the cluster of disease. There are many ways to detect unusual concentrations of health events in space and time (Fig. 3) . In epidemiology, spatial dependence may also help us to capture important facets of the realities of processes. [9] [10] [11] Spatial patterns of the spread of SARS provide clues to the process of spreading. The spatial process reflects interactions between the sites. BW join-count statistics was used to measure the spatial autocorrelation of SARS in Beijing. If the district reported a SARS case, it was colour-coded black (B), and if not, the district was colour-coded white (W). When two districts had some defined relations such as a common boundary, they were considered to be linked by a 'join'. A join may link two B districts, two W districts, or one B and one W district. Theses joins were called BB, WW and BW joins, respectively (Fig. 4) . We counted the numbers of BB, WW and BW joins in Beijing districts, and compared these results with the expected numbers of BB, WW and BW joins under the null hypothesis, H 0 , with no spatial autocorrelation among the districts. There was little difference to choose which of the three statistics should be used as the indicator of autocorrelation, but the results of Cliff and Ord suggest that BW is superior to BB. 9 The standard normal deviation (z scores) was used to test significance. High negative values indicate evidence of clustering, and high positive values indicate evidence of spacing 12 (Fig. 4) . Details of the formulae for the BW test, its power and its interpretation are discussed at length by Cliff and Ord. 9 Although the BW join-count statistic is a simple way to measure the spatial association of data using different 'joins', it can also be used to test hypothetical diffusion processes. 12 It should be noted that the non-free-sampling version of the significance test, which assumes that each district has the same probability of being infected, was used in this study.",

Models 1 and 2 are based on geographical relationships of the districts and these are the common methods for studying the spatial relationship. Models 3 and 4 are both based on the population, and they were chosen because people are the key focus of the SARS disease.

Model 7 was based on the relation of the urban and rural areas, and the model was designed to test the contagion within the urban-rural system.

The total number of joins is 42. The wave contagion model (M-2) assumes that SARS spreads by shortest paths among the districts.
