However, proteins of lower molecular weight are also synthesized, occasionally in excess of the virion pp60 (9, 12). It has been suggested that these proteins of lower molecular weight might be degradation products of pp60, which are generated during virus replication or during in vitro translation (11, 12) .

As shown in Fig.   2A , hyperimmune serum precipitates both pp60 and ~57 suggesting that ~57 is indeed a viral protein ( Fig. 2A) . Also, all of the monoclonal antibodies precipitated pp60. Two of these monoclonal antibodies, 53.13 and 53.14, also precipitated ~57. This result shows that pp60 shares antigenic determinants with ~57, but pp60 also contains additional antigenic determinants. To confirm that the intracellular form of pp60 is phosphorylated, and to determine whether ~57 is also phosphorylated, immunoprecipitates from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cell lysates were analyzed. As can be seen in Fig. 2B , both the monoclonal antibodies 53.13 and 53.14, which precipitated both pp60 and ~57 ( Fig. 2A) , precipitated only one 32P-labeled protein which comigrated with pp60. No %P-labeled ~57 was detected. These results and those obtained by pulse- chase analysis suggest that ~5'7 is not phosphorylated and that phosphate is added during the processing of ~57 into ~~60.",

Infected cells were labeled with [?S]methionine, suspended in RS buffer and lysed by Dounce homogenization (18). The lysates were separated into soluble (SlOO) and particulate (PlOO) fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 g for 1 hr. The SlOO phase contained ~5'7 and pp60, while the PlOO membrane fraction contained only pp60 (Fig. 3) . This result suggests that ~57 is present exclusively in cytosol while pp60 might also be associated with cellular membranes. To rule out the possibility that this apparent membranous association is due to contamination from polysomes or nonspecific association with membranes, the PlOO fraction was treated with 100 mM EDTA to disassociate pp60 from ribosomes and then with 2 M NaCl to disassociate it from membranes. Neither of these treatments released any detectable pp60 from the PlOO fraction (data not shown), suggesting the possibility that pp60 was an integral membrane protein, To rigorously examine this possibility, the PlOO fraction was treated with alkali which removes membrane-associated proteins but not the integral membrane proteins (4, I?'). Alkali treatment at pH 12, but not pH 10 removed pp60 from the PlOO fraction and released it into the SlOO fraction (Fig. 3 ). In contrast, neither gp25 nor ~120, which are integral membrane proteins (14) , were affected by this treatment, indicating that pp60 is strongly associated with, but not integrated into, the host cell membranes.",

This conversion occurs rapidly, since the synthesis of ~57 in the absence of pp60 could only be detected following short (2-5 min) pulses, and large quantities of pp60 could be found after chase intervals of as short as 5 min.

The PlOO fraction was resuspended in either RS buffer, or treated for 5 min at pH 10 or 12. Membranes were centrifuged again at 100,000 g for 1 hr and the supernatant and pellets examined for pp66 by electrophoresis on 6-15s linear gradient gels. Lane 1, control lysate; lanes 2 and 3, RS buffer supernatant and pellet; lanes 4 and 5, supernatant and pellet following treatment at pH 10; lanes 6 and 7, supernatant and pellet following treatment at pH 12; lane 8, control JHM lysate. addition, using 9 labeling, we could detect small amounts of phosphorylated pp60 after a 5-min pulse (data not shown). The rapidity of the phosphorylation explains the previous failure to appreciate the precursor-product relationship of these two proteins. It should be noted that, in different in vitro translation systems carried out in different laboratories, the primary translation product of the mRNA No. '7 of MHV obtained from infected cells was found to be either p60 or ~57 (9, 12) . It is not clear if this discrepancy is due to the possibility that p60 and ~57 were not electrophoretically separated in some studies, or whether some in vitro translation systems allowed phosphorylation of the primary gene product to take place. From the results presented here, it is more likely that p57 is the nonphosphorylated primary translation product of mRNA No. 7. The conversion of ~57 to pp60 probably involves only phosphorylation, since both proteins could be immunoprecipitated by anti-JHMV serum and by two anti-JHMV monoclonal antibodies specific for the pp60 of the purified virion. The observation that most of the monoclonal antibodies did not precipitate ~57, but only pp60, suggests that phosphorylation apparently induces a drastic conformational change. This conformational change might be responsible for some regulatory functions, such as (1) controlling the rate of transcription, (2) the switching of RNA transcription to replication, or (3) influencing the association of this protein with the virion genomic RNA or the cellular membranes. It is not clear whether there is heterogeneity in the degree of phosphorylation of pp60. However, the finding that ~57 was not completely converted to pp60 even after prolonged chase (Fig. 1B) suggests that some ~57 might not be phosphorylated under certain conditions.",

This protein is synthesized on free polysomes (IO), consistent with the current finding that ~57 is present exclusively in the soluble fraction of the cytoplasm (Fig. 3) . These fractions also contain pp60, suggesting that phosphorylation probably takes place in the cytosol. The majority of the pp60 is associated with the cellular membranes. However, pp60 could be removed from the membrane by harsh treatment with alkali, which removes only nonintegral membrane pro-teins (4, l7), while gp23 and gp90/180, which are synthesized and processed on the cellular membranes (IO), remained associated with the membranes in the PlOO fraction (Fig. 3) . These observations indicated that pp60 is closely associated with, but not integrated into host cell membranes. The nature of this association is very intriguing. It has been shown that pp60 is linked to gp25 in mature viral particles (21). There may be a similar interaction between these two proteins in the infected cells, which could serve as the focal points for virus maturation. It raises an exciting possibility that phosphorylation of pp60 might influence this interaction and thereby influence the virus maturation process. Such an idea is presently being examined in our laboratories.",
