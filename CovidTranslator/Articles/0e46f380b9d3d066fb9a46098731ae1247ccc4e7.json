Material and methods: A questionnaire survey was conducted by purposive sampling of 128 hospitals (36% of total hospitals in surveyed provinces), including 25 provincial and 103 district level hospitals, from 20 provinces in Vietnam. Data on availability of hospital characteristics, structural resources and health care workers was then analyzed. Results: Most hospitals (N80%) reported having 60% of the relevant structural resources. Significant differences were observed between provincial hospitals when compared to district hospitals in regards to availability of central oxygen piping system (78.3% vs 38.7%, p = 0.001) mechanical ventilation (100.0% vs 73.6%, p = 0.003), mobile x-rays (80.0% vs 29.8%, p b 0.001), carbapenem antibiotic (73.9% vs 17.4%, p b 0.001) and norepinephrine (95.8% vs 56.3%, p b 0.001). There was a limited availability of arterial blood gas analyzers (13.7%), oseltamivir (42.2%) and N95 respirators (54.6%) across all hospitals surveyed. Conclusions: The limited availability of relevant structural and human resources in critical care units around Vietnam makes the implementation of quality critical care to patients with SARI and sepsis, according international guidelines, not universally possible.",

Additionally, severe dengue, Streptococcus suis infection and the increase in antibiotic resistance are other major causes of sepsis in critical care units across Vietnam [12] [13] [14] . Because of Vietnam's regional prominence (size, population) and experiences with clinical management of emerging infections, it is in an opportune position to help understand the gaps (i.e. structural, processes, outcomes) and develop solutions (i.e. health system planning, modified guidelines, intervention trials, quality improvement) to improve the critical care management of patients with SARI and sepsis.",

Data was collected from 2 sources: (1) data extraction from the official hospitals statistics reports in 2014 and (2) self-administered questionnaire. The hospitals statistics are official regular reports at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months required by the Ministry of Health for governmental hospitals and validated by hospital internal quality control mechanisms. Data extraction forms included information on numbers of hospital and CCU admission, numbers of planned beds, average lengths of hospital and CCU stay for in-patients and numbers of doctors and nurses. For the self-administered questionnaire, item generation was initially developed by 2 investigators who are Intensivists working in tertiary referral ICUs in Vietnam and the United States through literature review and group discussion among peer ICU and ID physicians during the Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) Critical Care Training conducted in Vietnam in May 2015. Refinement and item reduction of the list of supplies, equipment and medicines was pragmatically generated through reviews of national guideline on management of H5N1 influenza (last updated on 2003), H1N1 influenza (last updated on 2011) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (last updated on 2015). With the consensus, the following domains were included: infection prevention and control, cardiorespiratory support and antimicrobials. The questionnaire was piloted for relevance and flow and further revised with inputs from 6 doctors working in ICUs and emergency departments in 2 provincial hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam, which were not included in the final analysis. The face validity was evaluated for the interpretation, appropriateness and logical sequence of questions using the Vietnamese questionnaire. The questionnaire content validity was also evaluated for the essentiality of the questions. The final questionnaire was distributed by mail and the information in the questionnaire was completed by the head of CCUs at selected hospitals and kept confidential. The respondents' answers were validated by the director board of the hospitals and returned to investigators for data entry and analysis.",

Despite these efforts, the results of this study show that all components of personal protective equipment were not universally available. While hand hygiene materials, medical masks and sterile gloves were available at all hospitals, there were still gaps in the availability of eye protection, protective clothing and particulate respirators. Implementation of infection prevention and control measures is essential to prevent the spread of infection between patients and health care workers and when there is a lapse in consistent and correct personal protective equipment use there can be transmission [19] . During the SARS pandemic in Vietnam, cross-transmission between patients and health care workers caused five deaths [20] , and similar nosocomial outbreaks were seen with MERS-coronavirus (CoV) in Saudi Arabia and South Korea [21] . The WHO recommends that when caring for all SARI patients with suspected influenza or other dangerous respiratory virus infection, that droplet precautions be used, and this indeed does seem locally feasible. But, the WHO also recommends the use of airborne precautions with particulate respirators when performing invasive procedures such as intubation [19] ; and if human infection with avian influenza or MERS-CoV is suspected then the addition of contact precautions. Clearly, healthcare workers in Vietnam would not be able to fully protect themselves consistently thus placing themselves and other patients at risk. These results demand improvement of the supply chain of personal protective equipment to all hospitals in Vietnam.",

Similar findings have been reported in many developing countries, in the fight against sepsis, outbreaks, pandemics and epidemics [5, 22] . For example, at the provincial level, a patient with fluid refractory shock would be able to receive the 1st line vasopressor norepinephrine (strong recommendation from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign [23] ) administered through a central venous catheter. However, this was not the case at the district hospital level, where noradrenaline and central venous catheters were not widely available. Our study also shows that the diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by the Berlin criteria was not feasible at either the provincial or district level hospitals because of the limited availability of blood gas analysis and mobile chest x-ray. This underscores the Lung Safe study that found that ARDS is under-recognized and under-treated globally [24] because its diagnosis in resource limited settings is much more difficult [25] . However, the Kigali-modification could be used as our study did find ultrasound to be available at both levels and near 100% availability of pulse oximetry. Vietnam could thus be an ideal setting to conduct a validation study of the Kigali-modified criteria. However, treatment of ARDS using lung protective ventilation strategy without blood gas analyzer would remain a challenge. More so at the district level, where there is limited availability of piped oxygen, ventilators and very low ventilator per bed ratios.",

In 2006, the WHO reported the health workforce capacity in South East Asia and other developing regions were still remarkably smaller than in developed regions (2.3 health workers per 1000 population in Africa, 4.3 in South East Asia compared [30] . In 2015, the density of doctors in Vietnam was 8.0 per 10,000 inhabitants [18] , an increase from 5.6 per 10,000 inhabitants reported in 2000. Vietnam ranked in the middle among other South East Asia in regards to countries-physician densities [31] . Our study can contribute to the global efforts to better understand the global capacity of ICUs [32] and highlights the need to train, recruit and retain more health care workers to meet the demand of busy (and growing) intensive care units in resource limited settings. In Vietnam, the national guidance of management for emerging respiratory diseases are established to use as reference for the clinical management at all level of hospitals in the country but are not regularly updated and may lead to mismatch with international guidelines. As well, because of the considerable facility shortages seen around the world, several modified sepsis guidelines for resource-restricted settings have been recommended [33] [34] [35] [36] . Future national guidelines and training materials need to be adapted and modified according to the reality of the resource-constraints and health system organization. Our study can help with these efforts, by understanding the difference in capacity between provincial and district level hospitals, the creation of feasible guidelines can be more realistic. These modified guidelines would then need to be evaluated for effectiveness.",

Firstly, the sampling of just 36% of hospitals makes it impossible to exactly gauge the capacity of the Vietnamese medical system, though we believe this purposive and pragmatic snapshot, is reflective of the larger picture in Vietnam, especially those with experience treating patients with SARI and with vigilance for imported case of avian influenza A virus. Secondly, the elements surveyed were also pragmatically chosen and based on national not international guidelines. This does not allow us to assess the hospital's ability to implement the full recommendations from recently published international guidelines on sepsis and other important safety interventions. Thirdly, the survey about availability of the antibiotics lacks important details and warrants further examination. Fourth, quantifying the structural and human resources are just two aspects of a country's ability to respond to infectious threats. Other aspects that need to be evaluated include the skills and knowledge of the health care workers in emergency and intensive care, and the system's current performance on processes of care and patient outcomes. More information is needed on other determinant of quality care.",
