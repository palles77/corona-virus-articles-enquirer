In this problem, we are given a central depot, a set of facilities and several customers which are located within a pre-determined coverage distance of available facilities. Each facility can supply the demand of some customers which are within its coverage radius. Starting from the depot, the goal is to maximize the total number of covered customers, by constructing a set of p length constraint Hamiltonian cycles. We have proposed a mixed integer linear programming model and three heuristic algorithms, namely iterated local search (ILS), tabu search (TS) and variable neighborhood search (VNS), to solve the problem. Extensive computational tests on this problem and some of its variants clearly indicate the effectiveness of the developed solution methods.",

Therefore, the problems in which researchers are seeking optimal methods to reduce the traveling time or distance as well as increase the number of satisfied customers are considered as effective ways to deal with the spreading of epidemics. For this reason, in this paper, we discuss a problem which simultaneously increases the number of the covered customers and decreases the length of the traveling distance. Indeed, we have combined the routing and the covering problems in order to benefit from the characteristics of both problems. Several combinatorial optimization problems, in the field of routing and covering, are proposed and developed. In particular, we can refer to the vehicle routing, the maximal covering and the traveling salesman problems. In the following, the mentioned problems and their variations are discussed first and then we outline the proposed problem, its characteristics and applications.",

            "text": "The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a combinatorial problem, seeking to visit a number of customers by utilizing a set of vehicles which are located at a central depot (Dantzig and Ramser 1959) . Most popular variants of this problem are the VRP with time windows (VRPTW), the capacitated VRP (CVRP) and the multi-depot VRP (MDVRP). In the VRPTW, each customer must be visited within a certain time interval. The problem has several applications including the meal delivery, the waste collection and the school bus routing problems (Jabali et al. 2015; Bae and Moon 2016; Buhrkal et al. 2012; Hiermann et al. 2016) . The vehicles are capacitated in the CVRP, and several applications, namely road transportation and network routing problems, have been introduced for this problem (Faulin et al. 2011; S\u00f6rensen and Schittekat 2013; Hosseinabadi et al. 2017) . The MDVRP uses multiple depots instead of one depot to construct the routes. Delivery of food and drugs, chemical and oil products is some applications of the MDVRP (Wasner and Z\u00e4pfel 2004; Kergosien et al. 2013; Lalla-Ruiz et al. 2016) .

            "text": "The covering salesman problem (CSP) is an extension of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) which is seeking construction of a minimum length tour over a subset of n nodes such that each unvisited node is within a pre-determined covering distance of at least one of the visited nodes. Routing of rural healthcare delivery teams, locating aircraft for overnight delivery systems and locating mail boxes are some applications of the CSP (Current and Schilling 1989) . Gendreau et al. (1997) introduced the covering tour problem in which the vertices are composed of three sets including a set of vertices that must be visited (S 1 ), a set of vertices that can be visited (S 2 ), and a set of vertices that must be covered (S 3 ) by visited ones. The purpose is to find a minimum length cycle over the vertices of S 1 and a subset of those belonging to S 2 in order to cover all the vertices of S 3 . One of the applications is locating the post boxes among potential sites in a way that all of the users located in a reasonable distance from boxes are covered and the cost of collection tour over all selected boxes is minimized. In Golden et al. (2012) the authors provided a generalized version of the CSP. The objective is to find a minimum cost route over a subset of vertices such that every unrouted vertex has to be covered at least k times by those vertices that are visited on the tour. As an application, in routing of rural healthcare delivery teams, in each day, a limited number of people could be served by the team; therefore, some points need to be visited more than once. Another related paper is Current and Schilling (1994) in which two bi-objective problems known as the median tour problem (MTP) and the maximal covering tour problem (MCTP) are introduced. In each problem, the vehicle must visit only p (out of n) nodes on the network. Furthermore, minimization of the total tour length is considered as one of the objectives of both problems. The second objective is maximizing the access of the tours to the nodes that are not directly on the tour. This objective in the MTP is realized by minimizing the total distance traveled from nodes that are not on the tour to the nearest stop on the tour, while in the MCTP it is achieved by minimizing the demand of nodes which are not covered by the stops on the tour. These two problems have numerous real-world applications such as rural healthcare delivery, designing of distributed computer networks and design of hierarchical transportation networks (Current and Schilling 1994) .",

This problem is a development of the TSP and also known as the selective TSP. Here, each vertex has an associated profit and instead of visiting all of the vertices, a subset of vertices with the maximum profit is visited, while the tour length is not allowed to exceed from a specified threshold (Laport and Martello 1990) . The team orienteering problem (TOP) is an extension of the previous problem and consists of determining m length constraint circuits. This problem has been proposed in Butt and Cavalier (1994) with the name multiple tour maximum collection problem (MTMCP) . Several variations of the TOP are presented in the literature including TOP with time windows (Vansteenwegen et al. 2009; Gunawan et al. 2015; Souffriau et al. 2013 ) and the capacitated orienteering problem in which vehicles have limited capacities (Archetti et al. 2010; Aras et al. 2011; Zachariadis and Kiranoudis 2011; Bock and Sanit\u00e0 2015) .

For example, in rural healthcare delivery system, teams should travel to numerous areas in a limited time to provide general care services like vaccination, emergency services or such activities for prevention of epidemics. Having a limited amount of resources, the teams have to select some areas for visiting in order to maximize the number of individuals that will be covered. Another application is discussed when natural or human disasters like earthquakes, wars or typhoons occur. In these situations, the problem includes the assignment of some locations for establishing field hospitals among the potential areas. The locations should be chosen in a way that the number of injured people who can receive emergency assistance is maximized and the traveled distance from main centers to these locations is minimized. In above examples, maximizing the covered demand subject to the availability of limited resources is the main issue which is the basic characteristic of the TCMCRP model.",

Constraint (8) indicates that each facility can be visited at most by one vehicle. Constraint sets (9)-(13) prohibit sub-tours which are adopted from (Kara 2011) .

The ILS is a metaheuristic algorithm that combines local search and perturbation procedures to search the feasible region more efficiently (Louren\u00e7o et al. 2003) . In particular, this algorithm has been successfully applied to solve similar problems such as TOP (Vansteenwegen et al. 2009; Gunawan et al. 2015; Zachariadis and Kiranoudis 2011) . For this reason, we use the ILS as one of the proposed methods for solving our problem. In this algorithm, a solution is created by following one of the proposed procedures in Sect. 3.1. The algorithm is composed of two loops. The inner loop is to improve the solution's cost by applying local search procedures. Essentially, at each iteration, a local search procedure is selected by using the roulette wheel technique (see Sect. 3.3.1). Before entering the outer loop, as long as the solution can be improved, the LS algorithm is applied. The pseudocode of the LS procedure is depicted in Algorithm 2. In fact, we tested several orders of the moves and the current order is the best combination. In this combination, at first we utilize the swap procedures followed by the extraction-insertion procedures. The reason of using the deletion and insertion procedures is that they can further improve the solutions obtained by applying the two mentioned procedures (i.e., swap and extraction-insertion), and this is why we call them after each execution of the swap and extraction-insertion procedures. The whole procedure is iterated for \"iter1\" iterations. In addition, during the execution of the outer loop, the goal is to escape from local optima by utilizing the perturbation procedure. The outer loop is repeated \"iter0\" iterations. The corresponding values for iter0 and iter1 will be set in Sect. 4.4.",

In this problem, a central depot, a set of facilities and a set of customers are given. The TCMCRP objective is to maximize the number of customers covered by facilities which are visited by a set of length constraint vehicles. We proposed a flow-based mathematical model to solve the model. Since the TCMCRP is a NP-hard problem, exact model is not effective for real size instances and heuristic algorithms including ILS, VNS and TS are presented for solving the problem. We tested the performance of these algorithms on 270 instances having 52-724 nodes and dividing into small, medium and large size sets. The numerical results showed that on average all the proposed algorithms outperform CPLEX especially in large size instances. Regarding the performance of the heuristic algorithms, the tabu search algorithm has the best performance in comparison with the other two algorithms. In addition, to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed heuristic algorithms we have adapted our algorithms to be used for the time-constrained maximal covering salesman problem and the team orienteering problem. The results indicate that developed heuristic algorithms can achieve promising results for the similar problems. In particular, by applying the TS algorithm on the TCMCSP instances, the results show the superiority of the TS with respect to the best results available in the literature. The results also indicate that the TS algorithm performs efficiently when applying on the TOP benchmark instances.",
