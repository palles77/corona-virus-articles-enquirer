Results of s\u00e9rologie screening of sentinel\" animals at six month intervals during two year studies and in experimental rodents at the end of 90 day and two year studies are presented in Table III . These figures are an update (8) of data presented previously (9).

Sera were submitted by contract laboratories which represent a cross-section of the typical toxicology testing laboratories in the U.S. Serologie results presented indicate that Sendai, PVM and MHV in mice and Sendai, PVM and RCV/SDA in rats are common contaminants.
