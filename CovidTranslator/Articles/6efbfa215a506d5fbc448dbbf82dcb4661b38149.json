At about the same time, Louis Pasteur applied Jenner's immunization technique for smallpox to the prevention of various animal diseases. Pasteur demonstrated that inoculation with a pathogen that had been weakened in the laboratory could protect against a subsequent exposure to the naturally occurring pathogen. It was Pasteur who coined the term vaccination (from the Latin vaccinus, meaning \"derived from cows\") for this procedure, in honor of Jenner's work. The research of Pasteur and other investigators spurred the evolution of immunology as a science distinct from (but related to) the established fields of microbiology, pathology, biochemistry and histology. Today, immunology can be defined as the study of the cells and tissues that mediate immunity and the investigation of the genes and proteins underlying their function.",

When this homeostasis is disturbed by either trauma, pathogens, or the deregulation of body cells (such occurs in cancer), the immune system responds in an attempt to restore balance. At its simplest level, this response involves identifying and clearing damaged and dying cells from the body. More complex responses have evolved to counteract assault on Selected landmark discoveries in immunology and immunologists who have won Nobel Prizes for their work are featured in Appendices A and B, respectively. the body by infectious agents, including bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi. Because these foreign invaders are literally everywhere on Earth and constantly seeking vulnerable hosts, the immune system is constantly occupied with containing attacks from this quarter. Indeed, despite the successful eradication of smallpox and the development of antibiotics, infectious diseases remain among the biggest killers on the planet. Longstanding disorders such as malaria and tuberculosis, as well as \"emerging\" diseases caused by new pathogens such as West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, and H1N1 influenza virus, present ongoing challenges to the immune system.",

In order to reproduce, however, many must penetrate a host's body or one of its component cells. Infection is defined as the attachment and entry of a pathogen into the host. Once inside the body or cell, the pathogen replicates, generating progeny that spread into the body in a localized or systemic fashion.

This resistance is due to both basic and sophisticated immune responses that combat pathogens. Simply put, the job of the immune response is to \"clean up\" infections in the interstitial fluid, tissues and blood, and to destroy infected host cells so that neighboring host cells do not share their fate. Because pathogens are constantly evolving mechanisms to evade or block immune defenses, the immune system must constantly adapt to maintain its effectiveness. It is a continual horse race as to which will be the more successful mechanism: the body's immune surveillance or the pathogen's invasion and infection strategy. We note here that the immune response itself may cause limited collateral damage to tissues as part of its larger battle against pathogens, but such immunopathic effects are usually short-lived in an otherwise healthy individual.",

One group of scientists believed that immunity depended primarily on the actions of cells that destroyed or removed unwanted material from the body. This clearance process was referred to as cell-mediated immunity. However, another group of researchers was convinced that soluble molecules in the serum of the blood could directly eliminate foreign entities without the need for cellular involvement. In this case, the clearance process was referred to as humoral immunity, a term derived from the historical description of body fluids as \"humors.\" Today, we know that both cell-mediated and humoral responses occur simultaneously during an immune response and that both are often required for complete clearance of a threat.",

The soluble molecules responsible for humoral immunity are proteins called antibodies, and antibodies are secreted by a particular type of leukocyte. The production of these antibodies and the mounting of cell-mediated immune responses depend on an elaborate signaling system by which leukocytes communicate with each other as well as with other cell types in the body.

Products synthesized by leukocytes mediating innate responses (innate leukocytes) also help to prevent \"bystander injury\" of healthy tissues. With respect to invading pathogens, elements of the innate immune system are the first to confront the threat and work to eliminate it from the body. Such elements include preexisting anatomical and physiological barriers that attempt to block pathogen entry, and other responses that are induced after the pathogen has gained entry. Only if innate responses are insufficient to control the situation and restore homeostasis, as is often the case with infection by a rapidly replicating pathogen, is an adaptive response mounted.

Cell damage or death in the absence of a pathogen gives rise to DAMPs only, but both DAMPs and PAMPs will be present when a pathogen invades ( Fig. 1-2) .

Furthermore, because innate leukocytes expressing PRMs are present in large numbers, these cells don't need to multiply to work effectively: the response is immediate. Finally, because innate leukocytes are activated but don't multiply in response to engagement of their PRMs, the speed and strength of their response is exactly the same upon a second exposure to the same pathogen or type of damage.

In contrast to the broad recognition of the PRMs mediating the innate response, the receptors expressed by the cells participating in the adaptive response (adaptive leukocytes) are equipped with receptors that recognize unique molecular structures on pathogens. These unique structures are called antigens, and the receptors that recognize them are antigen receptors. Together as a population, adaptive leukocytes express a vast array of antigen receptors capable of recognizing almost any structure, meaning that they represent a diverse repertoire of antigen specificities. However, the antigen receptor of any one adaptive leukocyte binds to an antigen exclusive to a single type of pathogen. Thus, antigen receptors have the property of specific recognition. Because adaptive leukocytes are very few in number, these cells must proliferate and expand their ranks after receptor engagement before they can be effective: the response is delayed. In addition, after adaptive leukocytes proliferate and act to eliminate the pathogen, some of these cells become long-lived so that the speed and strength of the adaptive response is increased upon a subsequent exposure to the same pathogen. The adaptive response is thus said to have memory. The distinguishing features of the innate and adaptive responses are summarized in Table 1 -1.",

The BCR of a B cell binds directly to an intact antigen, which may be either a soluble molecule or a molecule present on the surface of a pathogen ( Fig. 1-5A) . Activation of a B cell in this way causes it to proliferate and produce identical daughter effector cells called plasma cells that secrete vast quantities of specific antibody. An antibody is a protein that is a modified, soluble form of the original B cell's membrane-bound antigen receptor. Antibody molecules enter the host's circulation and tissues, bind to the specific antigen, and mark it for clearance from the body, establishing a humoral response. Since antibodies are present in the extracellular milieu, such a response is effective against extracellular pathogens. However, antibodies are unable to penetrate cell membranes and so cannot attack an intracellular pathogen once it has entered a host cell. Unlike BCRs, TCRs are unable to recognize whole, native antigens. Rather, a TCR recognizes a bipartite structure displayed on the surface of a host cell. This bipartite structure is made up of a host surface protein called an MHC molecule bound to a short peptide derived from a protein antigen. This complex is referred to as a peptide-MHC complex (pMHC). Tc and Th cells are activated by the binding of their TCRs to specific pMHCs presented on the surface of a DC. DCs can acquire extracellular pathogen antigens by phagocytosis, and intracellular pathogen antigens either by infection or by phagocytosis of the debris of dead infected cells. Peptides from these antigens are bound to one of two types of MHC molecules, either MHC class I or MHC class II, and then displayed on the DC surface for inspection by T cells.",

Rather, the BCR and TCR genes are assembled from a large collection of pre-existing gene segments by a mechanism called somatic recombination. A single, random combination of gene segments is thus created in each developing lymphocyte. As a result, a lymphocyte population is generated in which the antigen receptor proteins are vastly diverse in specificity because they are encoded by hundreds of thousands of different DNA sequences. In the case of B cells, additional mutational mechanisms operate that result in further structural diversification of antibody proteins.

By chance, some of the genetic sequences produced will encode receptors that recognize self molecules (self antigens). These lymphocytes must be identified as recognizing self and then either removed from the body entirely, or at least inactivated, to ensure that an individual has an effective lymphocyte repertoire that does not attack healthy tissue. Tolerance is established in two broad stages, each of which involves multiple mechanisms. The first stage, called central tolerance, occurs during early lymphocyte development. The mechanisms of central tolerance are designed to eliminate clones that recognize self antigens, thus establishing a lymphocyte repertoire that targets \"non-self.\" In the second stage, called peripheral tolerance, any B and T lymphocytes that recognize self but somehow escaped the screening of central tolerance and completed their development are functionally silenced by another set of inactivating mechanisms.",

In many cases, the incursion is completely controlled by the two phases of innate defense before adaptive immunity is even triggered. However, the cells of the innate response are ultimately limited both in numbers and in recognition capacity.

Pathogens replicate at widely divergent rates, with some bacteria and viruses able to double their population size within a couple of hours. Fast-replicating pathogens therefore initially get ahead of the host's immune defenses, but then are caught and destroyed as the specialized cells of the immune system become activated. The mystery highlighted by the authors of this article is why slowreplicating pathogens are able to establish infections at all, and why so many of the most damaging chronic infections we experience, like those of the hepatitis B and C viruses and the bacteria causing tuberculosis, are caused by some of the slowest-replicating pathogens. The answer may lie in achieving certain threshold levels of infection that supply adequate amounts of the molecular triggers needed to spark first the innate response and then the adaptive response. If a pathogen replicates rapidly, large amounts of DAMPs and PAMPs are present that immediately activate innate leukocytes, including the APCs needed to initiate T cell responses. These T cells proliferate quickly enough to overwhelm the pathogen and eliminate it. In contrast, a slow-replicating pathogen may generate only low levels of DAMPs and PAMPs that do not activate large numbers of APCs, delaying the T cell response. Even once the T cell response is initiated, without sufficient cytokines produced by activated APCs, T cell proliferation may be slow and insufficient to completely eliminate the pathogen. The pathogen then survives to establish a low level of infection that doesn't kill the host but makes him/her miserable. The memory T cell response is of little help, as it only controls rather than eliminates the slow-replicating pathogen. An uneasy balance is set up between the pathogen and the host immune system that results in chronic infection. The contrast in immune response kinetics between what the authors call \"fast\" and \"slow\" pathogens is illustrated in Figure 1 from their article.",

Currently, vaccination often uses a harmless pathogen antigen to induce the host to respond and generate large populations of memory lymphocytes, which stand guard ready to mount a faster and stronger response should the real pathogen attack. For a fast-replicating pathogen, this tactic is successful because these types of pathogens readily generate enough PAMPs, DAMPs and antigen to surpass the thresholds of APC and T cell activation. With the \"head start\" provided by memory lymphocytes, the pathogen may not get to replicate at all. However, a slow-replicating pathogen may not provide sufficient antigen to reach even the lower threshold required by memory T cells, meaning that the vaccine will not have offered an advantage to the host. Worse, if the large numbers of memory T cells present after vaccination compete for the miserly quantities of antigen present, and so proliferate only slowly, the pathogen may in fact get a better foothold than if the host had NOT been vaccinated. These considerations should encourage us to experimentally test the threshold hypothesis and to refine our approach to vaccination accordingly.",

There are several instances in which inappropriate actions of the immune system can result in pathologic consequences that tip the balance from health to disease ( Fig. 1-9) . Firstly, the normal attack of a healthy immune system on a foreign tissue transplant meant to preserve life results in transplant rejection and deleterious consequences for the transplant patient. Secondly, when the tolerance of an individual's adaptive immune response fails, self tissues are attacked in a way that can lead to autoimmune disease. Thirdly, an immune response that is too strong or long can result in hypersensitivity to an entity. In this situation, the normal inflammation that accompanies the response gets out of control and causes significant collateral tissue damage. When an individual's normal adaptive immune system responds inappropriately to an antigen that is generally harmless, the immune response is manifested clinically as a form of hypersensitivity called allergy. Lastly, if normal regulation of the inflammatory response is lost for an extended period for any reason, chronic inflammation ensues that can set up conditions allowing the development of tumors, heart disease or autoimmune disorders.",

It is our hope that the reader will come away with a solid understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying immunity and how these mechanisms can go awry to cause illness.
