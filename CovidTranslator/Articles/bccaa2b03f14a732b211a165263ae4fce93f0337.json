The novel virus belongs to the coronaviruses family, which is responsible for causing mild to moderate colds. The control and command center of Saudi Ministry of Health issues a daily report on MERS-CoV infection cases. The infection with MERS-CoV can lead to fatal complications, however little information is known about this novel virus. In this paper, we apply two data mining techniques in order to better understand the stability and the possibility of recovery from MERS-CoV infections. Method: The Naive Bayes classifier and J48 decision tree algorithm were used to build our models. The dataset used consists of 1082 records of cases reported between 2013 and 2015. In order to build our prediction models, we split the dataset into two groups. The first group combined recovery and death records. A new attribute was created to indicate the record type, such that the dataset can be used to predict the recovery from MERS-CoV. The second group contained the new case records to be used to predict the stability of the infection based on the current status attribute. Results: The resulting recovery models indicate that healthcare workers are more likely to survive. This could be due to the vaccinations that healthcare workers are required to get on regular basis. As for the stability models using J48, two attributes were found to be important for predicting stability: symptomatic and age. Old patients are at high risk of developing MERS-CoV complications. Finally, the performance of all the models was evaluated using three measures: accuracy, precision, and recall. In general, the accuracy of the models is between 53.6% and 71.58%.",

The experimental results using a dataset of 294 records with 13 attributes showed that the performance of the two algorithms is comparable.

[7] used Naive Bayes, back-propagated neural network, and the C4.5 decision tree algorithm to predict the survivability of breast cancer patients. The dataset used in the study was obtained from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER). Experimental results indicated that the C4.5 algorithm outperformed the other two techniques. Recently, several predictive models for breast cancer survival were developed [8] . The models were based on a dataset of 657,712 records and 72 variables, also obtained from SEER. Three different data mining techniques were used: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bayes Networks, and Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID). Results showed that the best survival prediction model was obtained using SVM. The authors in [8] presented a study of predictive models for breast cancer survival. The main goal was to discover important attributes that contribute to breast cancer survival. Three data mining techniques were used: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bayes Net, and Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID). Experiments on a dataset obtained from SEER showed that the SVM model outperformed other models in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. SVM was able to identify ten attributes that are important indicators of breast cancer survivability. Sandhu et al. [9] proposed a cloud-based MERS-CoV prediction system. The system is based on Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) for initial classification of patients. A geographic positioning system is utilized to represent patients on Google Maps. Patients classified as infected were tracked using GPS from their mobile phones. The proposed system is useful to citizens since it allows them to avoid infected areas. In addition, healthcare authorities can manage the infection problem more effectively. The BBN achieved an accuracy of 83.1% on synthetic data.",

In the J48 decision tree recovery model, shown in Fig. 2 , the attribute healthcare personnel appears as the first splitting attribute. This indicates the importance of this information. The model can be interpreted as follows: if the patient is a healthcare personnel, the model predicts recovery. However, if the patient is not a healthcare personnel then the model examines whether he has any pre-existing disease. If the patient suffers from other diseases, the model predicts death, otherwise recovery is predicted. According to this model, healthcare personnel are more likely to survive MERS-CoV infections. This could be due to the vaccinations that healthcare workers are required to get on regular basis. Fig. 3 shows the stability model using J48 decision tree algorithm. This model shows that the two important attributes for predicting stability are symptomatic and age. The model first checks symptoms, if symptoms exist, then the age of the patient is examined. The status of patients between the ages of 66-87 are predicted as critical. From this model, we conclude that old patients are at high risk of developing MERS-CoV complications. ",

In addition, it shows high recognition rate for the recovery class. However, the J48 has better recognition rate for class death. As for stability models, the results indicate that J48 has better overall accuracy. However, the recognition rate of class critical is very low. In general, we observe that the performance measures of the recovery models are higher than the stability models.",

Our models were built using Naive Bayes and J48 decision tree classification algorithms. The decision tree recovery model indicated that patients who are healthcare personnel are more likely to survive. The age attribute was found to be important in predicting the stability of the patient. Old patients with ages between 66 and 87 are more likely to suffer from critical complications. The performance of all the models was evaluated and compared. In general, the accuracy of the models is between 53.6% and 71.58%. We believe that the performance of the prediction models can be enhanced with the use of more patient data. As future work, we plan to directly contact hospitals in Riyadh in order to collect more information related to patients with MERS-CoV infections.",
