Two-thirds of all IgGs contain the kappa (\u03ba) light chain (Lc) isotype, with the remainder containing the lambda (\u03bb) Lc. 1 This well-studied structure provides a relatively stable scaffold, as well as unique Fc effector functions optimization of biophysical properties is a critical success factor for the developability of monoclonal antibodies with potential therapeutic applications. the inter-domain disulfide bond between light chain (Lc) and heavy chain (Hc) in human IgG1 lends structural support for antibody scaffold stability, optimal antigen binding, and normal Fc function. Recently, human IgG1\u03bb has been suggested to exhibit significantly greater susceptibility to reduction of the inter Lc-Hc disulfide bond relative to the same disulfide bond in human IgG1\u03ba. to understand the molecular basis for this observed difference in stability, the sequence and structure of human IgG1\u03bb and human IgG1\u03ba were compared. Based on this Lc comparison, three single mutations were made in the \u03bb Lc proximal to the cysteine residue, which forms a disulfide bond with the Hc. We determined that deletion of S214 (dS) improved resistance of the association between Lc and Hc to thermal stress. In addition, deletion of this terminal serine from the Lc of IgG1\u03bb provided further benefit, including an increase in stability at elevated pH, increased yield from transient transfection, and improved in vitro antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). these observations support the conclusion that the presence of the terminal serine of the \u03bb Lc creates a weaker inter-chain disulfide bond between the Lc and Hc, leading to slightly reduced stability and a potential compromise in IgG1\u03bb function. our data from a human IgG1\u03bb provide a basis for further investigation of the effects of deleting terminal serine from \u03bbLc on the stability and function of other human IgG1\u03bb antibodies.",

This analysis suggested that three mutations in residues proximal to the lambda Lc cysteine, which participates in the interchain disulfide bridge, may contribute to bond stability. Previously, an Hc hinge mutation of a human IgG1 was reported to improve the stability and the function of the parental antibody. 28 Moreover, a deletion mutation of a serine residue in a human IgG1\u03bb antibody demonstrated a potential for increasing disulfide bond stability upon partial reduction. 27 In this report, the effects of deletion of the terminal serine (dS) from the Lc on the stability and function of a selected human IgG1\u03bb (hereafter referred to as \u03bb) were examined more extensively. The dS variant has a profile for enhanced Lc-Hc disulfide bond stability to heat and elevated pH, and increased transient expression level and purification yield; however, the \u03bb to \u03ba substitutions, P210R and A211G, failed to improve the stability of the parental hIgG1\u03bb. Interestingly, this dS mutant demonstrated improved ADCC activity as well. The results of this study suggest a simple engineering approach to increase the stability, production, and the Fc function of an IgG1\u03bb antibody by deleting the terminal serine of Lc, but also confirm that the terminal serine is the only liability in the vicinity of the \u03bbLc cysteine in destabilizing the inter Lc-Hc disulfide bond from a human IgG1\u03bb.",

[29] [30] [31] [32] [33] Other selected lambda constant (C\u03bb) sequences from BLAST and PDB databases (encompassing Lambda I, II and III subfamilies), share > 93% sequence identity at the amino acid level, whereas, these C\u03bbs only share 30-39% sequence identity with C\u03bas. The most distinct feature of C\u03bbs compared with C\u03bas is the presence of a serine residue immediately following the cysteine residue that forms the interchain disulfide bond between the Lc and Hc at the upper hinge of IgG1 ( Fig. 1A and B) . In contrast, the glutamic acid residue positioned immediately before the cysteine residue is strictly conserved across C\u03bbs and C\u03bas.",

            "text": "The reversible nature of disulfide bonds supports their pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity of functional proteins, including IgGs. Although a disulfide bond is a covalent linkage with a dissociation energy of 60 kcal/mole in the protein structure, it has been considered a relatively \"weak link\" in the molecules architecture, being 30% weaker than a carbon-carbon bond (dissociation energy of 83-85 kcal/mole). 16 Recent findings have shown that disulfide bonds of IgGs are more reversible than previously believed. The Lc from naturally occurring IgG and IgA forms a disulfide bond with the heavy chain (Hc), but also self-associates, thereby creating a Lc dimer. 17 Moreover, inter-Hc disulfide bonds of the IgG4 subclass are requisite for the high disulfide exchange rate observed, which enables the transfer of half antibodies (HL) between two antibodies of distinct specificity and the formation of antibodies with dual specificity naturally. 18, 19 In addition, disulfide bond reshuffling has been reported to occur among different pairs of cysteines between antibody Lc and Hc, and between two Hcs. This leads to multiple disulfidebonded isoforms of IgG2 molecules detectable by capillary electrophoresis, 20 effecting significant molecular heterogeneity in this antibody isoform. [21] [22] [23] This effect, however, is context dependent and instability of the disulfide bond between Hcs is not observed in the IgG1 isoform. Any unpaired cysteines in recombinant monoclonal antibodies that may result from disulfide bond instability could affect the developability of the molecule by forming covalently linked aggregates. 24, 25 Among all IgG subclasses, IgG1 has a unique interchain disulfide bonding pattern that bridges the end of the Lc to the N-terminus of the hinge region on the Hc, rather than the beginning of the CH1 domain as observed in other IgG isoforms. 26 The Lc to Hc disulfide bond in IgG1 has also been shown to be prone to Lc loss due to the degree of disulfide bond reversibility. 14, 27 Recently reports have also shown that the disulfide bond between the Lc and the Hc in human IgG1 is weaker than the disulfide bonds present between the two Hcs as monitored by reduction, differential alkylation, and LC-MS analysis. 14 More importantly, the disulfide bond between Lc and Hc in human IgG1\u03bb is more susceptible to breakage under reducing conditions than that in human IgG1\u03ba. 14 Further analysis revealed that the serine residue at the C-terminus of human IgG1\u03bb makes a significant contribution to the susceptibility of this disulfide bond to reduction. 27 Altogether, these data imply due to a limited number of \u03bb antibody entries in PDB and largely flexible tails of Lc, the search only returned one entry for hIgG1 C\u03bb-1AQK (Lambda I subfamily), and 12 hIgG1 C\u03bas with complete and ordered Lc-Hc disulfide bonds ( Table 1) . Other Fab structures from PDB become disordered in the C-terminal region at or near the cysteine in Lc. By sequence comparison, 1AQK shares high sequence identity in both C\u03bb and Lc with the tested \u03bb antibody (78% identical in hIgG\u03bb Lc; 97% identical in C\u03bb) (Fig. 1A) . 1AQK was therefore used as the representative limited to cysteines with residue numbers between 200-250 for both Lc and Hc. Since IgG2 and IgG4 have unique Lc-Hc disulfide bond patterns and different cysteine locations in Hc from IgG1, they were also excluded from our discussion by this residue number criterion. To avoid inaccuracies from coordinates, only the crystal structure with a resolution higher than 3 \u00c5 was selected. A complete analysis on multiple C\u03bb structures is desired as the first step to understand whether there is common structural feature around the Lc-Hc disulfide bond in hIgG1\u03bbs; however, (equivalent to E214 in 1AQK) in both C\u03ba and C\u03bb from all Lcs were calculated and compared ( Fig. 1A ; Table 1 ). Due to the lack of multiple entries for C\u03bb, the average per residue B factor in 1AQK was directly compared with the overall average per residue B factor at the equivalent C215 or E214 location from 12 available C\u03ba structures. At cysteine location, the average B factor is 79.96 \u00c5 2 for C\u03bb, in contrast to an overall average B factor of 58.72 \u00c5 2 from 12 C\u03bas. Likewise, the average B factor of the conserved glutamic acid residue (E214 in 1AQK) of C\u03bb is 80.13 \u00c5 2 , higher than that of 52.46 \u00c5 2 from all C\u03bas. From our observation with limited sampling on C\u03bb, the elevated B factors for both E214 and C215 from 1AQK indicate a more flexible nature for atoms at or near the Lc-Hc disulfide bond in C\u03bb and a more destabilizing environment for such a disulfide bond in both C\u03bbs from 1AQK and possibly our selected \u03bb antibody under discussion.",

            "text": "To understand the relative stability of the Lc-Hc disulfide bond between C\u03bb and C\u03ba, the flexibility of the Lc terminal cysteine (equivalent to C215 in PDB 1AQK) and glutamic acid (equivalent to E214 in PDB 1AQK) of C\u03bb and C\u03ba from the hIgG1 Lc-Hc disulfide bond database were analyzed by comparing B factors, 35 which describe the mean square displacement of atoms, at these two locations from all the crystal structures in disulfide bond database. In most structures, within each C\u03bb or C\u03ba domain, the B factors of atoms from cysteine at the C-termini are higher than those from residues located prior to the C termini. The difference highlights the flexible nature of the protein in the region surrounding the disulfide bond between Lc and Hc in both C\u03bb and C\u03ba. The average B factors of the cysteine residues (equivalent to C215 in 1AQK) involved in the Lc-Hc disulfide bond and the adjacent conserved glutamic acid residues containing a \u03bb Lc is potentially less stable than the inter-chain disulfide bond in a Fab with a \u03ba Lc. First, C214 of C\u03ba points toward CH1, forming a disulfide bond with C233 (H), whereas at the C215 position of C\u03bb the main chain makes a 90 degree turn away from C226 (H) of CH1 (Fig. 2) , to accommodate the extra serine residue (S216) in C\u03bb and to avoid steric interference with the CH1 domain ( Fig. 2 ). In addition, the strength of the lambda Lc-Hc disulfide bond could also be negatively affected by the interaction with the trailing serine residue. Given the high flexibility at the end of C\u03bb, the amide group of S216 (C\u03bb) could form a hydrogen bond, thereby weakening the disulfide bond. 39 The negative charge of the carboxyl group at the C-terminus of the \u03bb Lc could initiate a nucleophilic attack, potentially weakening the disulfide bond between \u03bb Lc and Hc. 39 Interestingly, the hydroxyl side chain of the terminal serine is oriented on the opposite side of the disulfide bond, making it less likely that this side chain functional group is involved in the destabilization. Consistent with our observation, a serine to alanine mutation at the end of the \u03bb Lc did not reduce the inter-chain disulfide bond susceptibility to reduction. 27 Taken together, data afforded by our database and structural comparison of C\u03bb and C\u03ba reveal that the Lc-Hc disulfide bond between C\u03bb-CH1 of the only available hIgG1\u03bb structure 1AQK and potentially our selected \u03bb antibody reported herein is inherently less stable than that in C\u03ba-CH1 and the main chain conformation of the terminal serine at the end of the constant region of the \u03bbLc of 1AQK and selected \u03bb antibody could have a negative effect on the stability of the disulfide link between Lc and Hc.",

The CH1 domains of 1AQK and 1Y0L Fabs were superimposed as they are 99% identical (Fig. 2) . The RMSD of C\u03b1 atoms across 100 aligned residues from both CH1 domains is 1.2 \u00c5. Overall, the conformations around the cysteine residues at the C-termini of C\u03bb and C\u03ba are found to be very different. Several observations indicate that the disulfide bond between Lc and Hc in a Fab the pDB entries were obtained from the disulfide bond database analysis in Table 1 . the Chi1 angle calculation was performed using the rotamer database from program Coot. 37 To further define disulfide bond stability differences at the molecular level between \u03bb and \u03ba IgG1s, single \u03bb-to-\u03ba point mutations were made around the cysteine residue at the C-terminus of the Lc constant region of \u03bb. Three mutants that introduced residues found in \u03ba Lcs were created by site-directed mutagenesis: \u03bbdS (S214 deletion), \u03bb A211G and \u03bb P210R. The location of these select residues was based on the lack of sequence identity at these positions between C\u03bb and C\u03ba across multiple sequence alignments ( Fig. 1A and B) . To ensure that the variants retained biological function, binding to targeted receptor X was tested in an antigen down ELISA. Compared with \u03bb (EC 50 = 0.63 nM), the mutants had similar EC 50 s for receptor X binding, ranging from 0.57-0.95 nM, indicating no alteration in binding properties arose as a result of the directed mutations in the Lc constant region ( Table 3 ). The thermal stability of native \u03bb and these mutants was then evaluated. The patterns of Lc and Hc association for \u03bbdS, \u03bb A211G and \u03bb P210R were determined at RT, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90\u00b0C and compared with the native \u03bb (Fig. 3B-D) . The intact IgG ratio (defined as staining intensity of LHHL relative to the staining intensity of all species) was also determined for each antibody at different temperatures (Fig. 3E) . Only \u03bbdS displayed markedly improved association between Lc and Hc, based on reduced level of the HH (100 kD) and H (50 kD) species (Fig. 3B) and an increased amount of LHHL (Fig. 3E) . Mutations at A211G and P210R in \u03bb did not enhance the stability of the disulfide bond between the Lc and Hc, as the levels of partial IgG species at each temperature were To confirm the higher susceptibility to breakage of the interchain disulfide bond in IgG1\u03bb, a thermal challenge assay was used to accelerate the process in order to monitor differences in the association between Hc and \u03bb or \u03ba Lc. Antibodies were incubated at various temperatures for 15 min before being resolved by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions.",

At room temperature (25\u00b0C), both antibodies remained largely intact. The primary species migrated at a molecular weight of ~150 kD (LHHL) (Fig. 3A) . At 90\u00b0C both antibodies became dissociated as evidenced by the appearance of several bands of lower molecular weight.

At pH 7.0, the serine deletion mutant was as stable as the kappa Lc IgG1, \u03ba, whereas the lambda Lc IgG1 \u03bb showed some loss of Lc, indicating greater susceptibility of the Lc-Hc with IgG1\u03bb (Fig. 4) . This suggested that deletion of the terminal serine renders the disulfide bond more resistant to breakage at higher pH. The higher susceptibility for \u03bb Lc-Hc disulfide bond to break at more basic pH is likely associated with the combination of greater reduction potential in the high pH buffer and less reduction potential (weaker) of the disulfide bond to be reduced. There is an inverse relationship between pH and redox potential, nominally -59 mV/pH unit; 40 therefore, increasing pH also lowers the solution potential, rendering it a more reducing environment relative to lower pH. Moreover, by removal of the terminal serine, the Lc-Hc disulfide in \u03bbdS becomes a stronger bond, therefore more resistant to being reduced at basic pH compared with the same bond in \u03bb. In conclusion, we hypothesize this change in potential resulting from increased pH is sufficient to effect the difference in reversibility of this Lc-Hc disulfide bond between \u03bb and \u03bbdS IgG1 tested. Improved expression and purification of the serine deletion mutant of IgG1\u03bb. To explore further the consequences of stabilizing the inter-chain disulfide bond by deletion of the C-terminal serine residue at the C-terminus of \u03bb Lc, the expression level and behavior during purification of the engineered antibody was examined. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with \u03bbdS and \u03bb separately. The expression level of the antibody was quantified using an Octet biosensor (ForteBio). Transient expression of \u03bbdS was significantly higher than that of \u03bb (160.6 \u00b1 9.5 mg/L vs. 90.4 \u00b1 14.6 mg/L, p = 0.0022) (Fig. 5) . The process yield of both \u03bb and \u03bbdS were evaluated after affinity chromatography over a Protein A column, a procedure used routinely to capture IgG and remove impurities. The process analysis was done under elution conditions at pH 3.1. No precipitation was observed for either \u03bb or \u03bbdS during elution from the column or during the subsequent hold step at low pH. When \u03bbdS was eluted from the column at pH 3.1, process yield was high (97.4%). By contrast, only 85.4% of the \u03bb loaded on the Protein A column was eluted under the same conditions. As the elution pool was neutralized to pH 7.0 using 2 M solution of Tris base, precipitation occurred to a similar extent for both \u03bbdS and \u03bb, based on turbidity of the solution. The high recovery in the clarification step following neutralization, however, indicated that the precipitation was due to host cell protein impurities, not the antibody. These findings demonstrate improved transient expression and performance during purification of the engineered serine deletion mutant. The enhanced expression and purification processes of the \u03bbdS mutant are likely attributed to better assembly between dS Lc and Hc when the IgG is produced.",

Mutations in the hinge region of IgG1s have been reported to ameliorate both CDC and ADCC. 28, 41 Introduction of an IgG4-like disulfide bond between Lc and Hc into IgG1 completely abrogates ADCC activity, underlining the importance of such interaction for Fc effector function. 42 The inter-chain lost both Lcs, as the dominant species was HH (~110 kD, Fig. 4) . A moderate amount of the HHL form is also present, indicating the loss of one Lc from \u03bb (Fig. 4) . Only a very minimal amount of \u03bb remained as an intact IgG. In contrast, 50% of both Lcs remain stably attached to the Hcs of \u03ba (Fig. 4) . There was only moderate loss of both Lcs (HH species) compared with \u03bb. At high pH, \u03bbdS was more stable than \u03bb, but not as stable as \u03ba. The serine deletion significantly improved the association between Lc and Hc by stabilizing the inter-chain disulfide linkage, with a significant amount of the mutant (25%) still remaining as intact IgG with both Lcs (Fig. 4) . Moreover, the serine deletion mutant showed a higher amount of IgG with only one missing Lc (HHL) and lower amount of IgG with two missing Lc (HH) compared various Fc\u03b3Rs by \u03bbdS and \u03bb was performed.

Since assessment on a solid surface may not represent the scenario where antibody is able to bind targets on both effector and target cells, as happens in cell based ADCC assay (see more details in Discussion), we evaluated antibody-mediated effector cell activation in the presence of target cells, A431x, to confirm improvement in ADCC for \u03bbdS. Engineered reporter Jurkat cells stably overexpressing the Fc\u03b3RIIIa receptor V158 (high affinity) variant were used as effectors. \u03bbdS induced a 2.8-fold increase over the background in effector cell activation at a saturating concentration compared with a 1.9-fold increase with IgG1\u03bb ( Fig. 6C and D) . These data are in good agreement with our observation from the ADCC assay, further corroborating more robust ADCC activity of \u03bbdS.",

By partial reduction and differential alkylation with 12 C/ 13 C iodoacetic acid, ~81% of the disulfide bond between Lc and Hc was reduced to free cysteine in both native IgG1\u03bb with a terminal serine and a variant IgG1\u03bb with a terminal alanine. 27 In contrast, only 41% of the same disulfide bond between Lc and Hc was reduced to free cysteine in a variant IgG1\u03bb with the terminal serine residue deleted. 27 The lack of resistance to reduction in the alanine mutant is likely because alanine preserves the characteristics of the serine main-chain backbone. While the previous report pointed out the liability of the terminal serine for stability, it only focused on characterization of the difference among Lc mutants in susceptibility to chemical reduction.

The response of the double mutants to thermal stress was identical to that observed for the \u03bbdS (data not shown), which supports the finding that the terminal serine is the primary residue in the vicinity of the interchain disulfide bond between Lc and Hc of human IgG1\u03bb that contributes to the lower stability of \u03bb relative to \u03bbdS. Interestingly, the major intermediate species produced from human IgG1\u03bb under both thermal and pH stress is the H-H dimer, suggesting that the serine residue introduces greater susceptibility of the disulfide bond between the Lc and Hc to both conditions, which is in good agreement with previous studies. 14, 15 It is to our expectation that the addition of a serine residue (\u03ba to \u03bb mutation) to the end of C\u03ba of a human IgG1 would produce a less stable Lc-Hc disulfide bond, similar to what is observed with hIgG1\u03bb. This is supported by recent findings. 43 Various building blocks, including scFvs, single domain protein scaffolds, and peptides, have been linked to the C terminus of CL of IgGs to construct muti-specific antibodies. 43, 44 Consistent with our observations and those of others that the extra serine in C\u03bb weakens the Lc-Hc disulfide bond, the addition of extra amino acids (scFv or peptide) following the last cysteine of a human IgG1 C\u03ba destabilizes the Lc-Hc disulfide bond, leading to an increase of partially assembled IgG fusion molecules (HHL or HH) compared with the native IgG molecule by western blot analysis. 43 In such a case, the disruption of the naturally occurring Lc-Hc disulfide bond does not appear to affect the binding, serum stability, or stability at low pH. 43 However, the effect of the loss of this covalent linkage between Lc and Hc on function might vary from molecule to molecule.

            "text": "It is known that the interaction between IgG1 and FcRn is crucial to maintain the circulating concentration of IgG1 in vivo. [47] [48] [49] [50] A majority of the residues from IgG1 involved in FcRn binding is located in close proximity to the junction of the CH2 and CH3 domains, away from the hinge region and the interchain disulfide bond between Lc and Hc. Therefore, molecular changes at or around hinge region are less likely to alter the PK properties of the antibody. The dS mutant did not improve the PK properties of \u03bb, which is consistent with data showing that the Hc hinge mutation, H229Y, also did not alter the PK properties of human IgG. 28 Moreover, it was reported previously that the PK profile remains the same when the entire C\u03bb is switched to C\u03ba in human IgG1, IgG3 and IgG4. 15 With the advancement of antibody display libraries, more human IgG1 antibodies with \u03bb Lc isotype have been identified in preclinical programs and are entering clinical pipelines. Inferior stability of the disulfide bond between the Lc and Hc could potentially hinder the successful development of human IgG1\u03bb antibodies as a class of effective therapeutic agents. The study presented here, focusing on the region around the disulfide bond between the Lc and Hc, provides extensive characterization of the stability and function of a human IgG1 \u03bb antibody, and suggests a critical role for the C-terminal serine residue of \u03bb Lc in the stability of the Lc-Hc interaction in human IgG1\u03bb. More importantly, we demonstrated that deletion of the serine enhances the stability, expression, processability and ADCC activity without affecting binding to antigen. This examination of the properties of a specific pair of \u03bb and \u03bbdS antibodies might represent a unique case, but the analysis presented in this report serves as a general framework for testing other antibodies of human IgG1\u03bb isotype. Further investigation with a large number of human IgG1\u03bbs will confirm whether the deletion of the C-terminal serine from \u03bbLc is a general platform for improving the properties of human IgG1\u03bb, reducing the time and cost to develop this class of molecules for therapeutic use.",

Preliminary data from tests of stability to both temperature and pH demonstrate clearly similar improvement in the dS molecules relative to the native IgG1\u03bb (unpublished data). These data from the additional hIgG1\u03bb suggest that the enhanced stability of Lc-Hc disulfide bond, through the deletion of the trailing serine residue in hIgG1\u03bb, might be generalizable. Moreover, although the differences in stability between \u03bb and \u03ba antibodies in this report could originate from the sequence differences in these VL-VH pairs, our recent data using two hIgG1s with variation only in the C\u03bb and C\u03ba region, confirm that variation in C\u03bb is sufficient to induce a less stable Lc-Hc disulfide bond at high pH (unpublished data). This further validates that the negative effect of the terminal serine on the stability of the disulfide bond in C\u03bb is conserved with little to no influence from the variable regions.",

From a recent report, an H229Y mutation in the upper hinge of the Hc from a human IgG1 antibody improved both the stability and the ADCC function (by 3-fold) by preventing cleavage of the Hc-Hc disulfide bond through radical-induced degradation. 28 The enhancement of ADCC activity by the H229Y is correlated with a higher affinity for Fc\u03b3R. 28 Unlike the H229Y mutant, \u03bbdS did not show improved binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIa V158, Fc\u03b3RIIIa F158 or Fc\u03b3RIa by ELISA compared with the native IgG (data not shown). Nevertheless, the serine deletion mutant demonstrated enhanced ADCC activity. The improvement in ADCC activity resulting from the deletion of the terminal serine was interesting and unexpected. This suggests that the increase in ADCC activity resulting from the serine deletion in the \u03bb Lc is operating through mechanisms different from the mutation in the upper hinge region of the Hc. The discrepancy between the results from binding and ADCC assays in our study might be due to differences in the assay formats. It is hypothesized that a conformational change in the hinge region induced by the deletion of serine could affect the Fc\u03b3R binding site only upon binding to both cell surface antigen and cell surface Fc\u03b3R, which occur only in the ADCC assay, but not in the ELISA binding assay. This hypothesis was partially corroborated by our effector cell activation data where \u03bbdS induced a greater increase in DNA/fectin complex, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 6 d. Antibody expression levels in culture supernatant were determined using the Octet protein A biosensor (Pall, Octet).",

The release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity from the lysed targeted cells (A431 transfected with receptor target X, A431x) was monitored in the presence freshly isolated normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC, AllCells, PB002) upon the treatment with \u03bb or \u03bbdS antibody. 2 \u00d7 10 4 cells were seeded in each well of 96-well round-bottom plates in 50 \u03bcl of assay medium, containing RPMI 1640 with 1% BSA and 100 units/ml A database search was performed to obtain a complete list of ordered Lc-Hc disulfide bond structural parameters of human IgG1 X-ray crystal structures from the Disulfide Bond Analysis database, 34 which curates detailed structural information of disulfide bonds from all protein structures in PDB. To generate a restricted Lc-Hc disulfide bond subset of the database for human IgG1, the following criteria were applied to the Disulfide Bond Analysis database: (1) Restrict the selection to \"Immune System\" for header column; (2) Limit the resolution to better than 3 \u00c5; (3) Remove the entries that contain Lc dimers; (4) Select the disulfide bond with the residue number of cysteine between 200-250. The advantage of subsetting the original Disulfide Bond Analysis database is that all the PDB entries selected have a complete Lc-Hc disulfide bond already, in comparison to a search directly against PDB. The final hIgG1 Lc-Hc disulfide bond database contains 1 hIgG1\u03bb Fab sequence and 12 hIgG1\u03ba Fab sequences. Disulfide bond strain energy and bond distance were obtained directly from the Disulfide Bond Analysis database. 34 The average B factor per residue for cysteines (equivalent to C215 in PDB 1AQK) and glutamic acids (equivalent to E214 in 1AQK) for these 13 CLs were calculated for comparison. The Chi1 torsion angle for every C\u03bb or C\u03ba cysteine involved in interchain disulfide bond was calculated using program Coot. 37 The deviation (\u0394Chi1) of each cysteine Chi1 from the closest Chi1 reported from a rotamer database from Coot was also calculated and compared.",

Native \u03bb, \u03ba and lambda-to-kappa conversion single mutants \u03bbdS, \u03bb A211G and \u03bb p210R were subjected to thermal challenge at different temperatures from Rt (25\u00b0C) to 90\u00b0C and examined by SDS-pAGe under non-reducing conditions. Species resulting from the dissociation of Lc (L) and Hc (H) from the IgG are labeled according to the molecular weights of the bands on SDS-pAGe.
