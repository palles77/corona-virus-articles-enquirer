Initially, research focused on nanocarrier biocompatibility and toxicity, whereas second-generation nanomaterials aimed to have an optimized surface, to provide more stability, stealth, and targeting capabilities. The most recent models support the 'smart nanomedicine' idea, improving targeting mechanisms and theranostic abilities [1] . This nanotechnological advance is important because it enables drugs to cross physiological barriers to reach their target sites safely and sustainably [2] . In fact, nanomaterials provide a stable biocompatible environment to encapsulate drugs, promoting their controlled release and efficient absorption [3, 4] . They also improve the duration of the therapeutic effects and minimize adverse effects by driving drugs toward the site of action and increasing the concentration of a drug in the area of pathology in a specific way [5, 6] . Depending on the accumulation of the delivery system in the tissue, cell, or in a specific subcellular compartment of interest, targeting approaches can be primary, secondary, or tertiary, respectively [7] . Subcellular targeting is vital for efficient, specific treatments and, thus, specific barriers must be overcome. The importance of organelle targeting increases when drugs efficiently treat or He is also currently a visiting professor at the Post-Graduate School, UniOeste (Brazil).

Specifically, the intracellular environment contains compounds, responsible for cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and death, that are, therefore, promising drug targets. Thus, target sites can be distributed throughout the cytoplasm, nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Golgi complex [9] . However, endosomes and lysosomes, which have a low pH and are rich in enzymes, can result in drug degradation or nonspecific distribution [10, 11] . Thus, modulation of the size, charge, and surface composition of a nanomaterial can dictate the internalization pathway, enabling the nanomaterial to evade lysosomes and interact with its target organelle [12] . Indeed, the potential of nanomaterials to overcome such barriers has led to the development of platforms capable of improving their bioavailability [13] .",

Nanomaterials can be administrated by several routes, with the oral route being the most convenient [15] . However, for efficient oral delivery, nanomaterials must pass through the oral cavity, which is rich in proteins, mucosal compounds, and bacterial flora, followed by the stomach, which is highly acidic, and finally the intestine, where the nanomaterials will be subjected to the activity of digestive enzymes, the presence of a mucus layer (formed of the glycoprotein mucin), and tight junctions (TJs). Once they have crossed the endothelial barrier, the nanomaterials reach the blood, where they can be taken up unspecifically by phagocytic cells or by specific target cells [16] .

Epithelial cells also constitute a physiological barrier, because they are bond by TJs. Nanomaterials be modified physicochemically in response to low pH, high temperatures, reactions with surrounding molecules, in addition to changes to the weight and charge of the nanomaterial, which will also influence their absorption and degradation [17] . An additional barrier is the intestinal epithelium, which controls the passage of drugs into the blood. Its surface area, 99% of which is covered by enterocytes and microvilli, significant impacts absorption [18] . Morphologi-cally, intestinal crypts comprise absorptive enterocytes and secretory cells (e.g., goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells, and Paneth cells).

The nanomaterial is transported through two juxtaposed cells via aquaporins and TJs. Aquaporins are proteins that facilitate water transport across the luminal space to the basolateral membrane [21] , whereas TJs maintain the structural integrity of the membrane. TJ are gaps between cells and contain occludin and claudin-2 proteins, which aids paracellular transport because of their permeability [22] . The presence of TJs and a low surface area limit the transport of nanomaterials, because they cannot pass through the intestinal barrier via this route. The TJs must be reversibly opened by chemically modifying the nanomaterial using permeation enhancers, such as chitosan, polyacrylate, and thiolated polymers (anionic and cationic polymers) [23] . Thus, the paracellular pathway mainly transports hydrophilic drugs [3, 6] . A recent study used a cationic cyclodextrin-polyethylenimine 2k conjugate complexed with anionic mRNA encoding HIV gp120 to open TJs and enhance the paracellular transport of the nanomaterial [24] .",

Thiomers have the ability to mimic the mechanism of secreted mucus glycoproteins, covalently binding through disulfide bonds with cysteine from the mucus, enhancing their mucoadhesion and inhibiting enzyme actions [25] . Thus, thiomers remain concentrated at the absorption membrane as a result of the protection of their thiol groups and efflux inhibition [26] . Thiomers reduce oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to GSH at the same time that thiol groups are oxidized to disulfide bonds, attaching the nanomaterial to the mucosa glycoproteins [27] . Then, GSH binds to the cysteine active site of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) via a disulfide bond, preventing PTP from remove the phosphate group from the tyrosine residues. This results in the TJs opening, improving the permeation properties of the nanomaterial and facilitating its diffusion [28] . An early study showed PTP inhibition using sodium orthovanadate, which led to tyrosine phosphorylation at TJs and improved the permeability in bovine corneal epithelial cells [29] . TJs are responsible for the uptake of hydrophilic nanomaterials throughout the paracellular route and their association with thiomers increases their apparent permeability [30, 31] .",

Dynamin is a GTPase protein that leads to the division of clathrin pits from the membrane, resulting in the formation of small vesicles (60-200 nm) coated in clathrin. After internalization, clathrin is removed by auxilin and HSC70 and vesicles are fused with Rab5 early endosomes [33, 37] . This mechanism is seen as a housekeeping mechanism that degrades unwanted proteins and maintains cellular homeostasis; it is a route usually involving low-density lipoproteins, transferrins, and ligand-receptor complexes [36] . Pharmacological inhibitors have been used to analyze the topology of endocytosis [38, 39] . Steinbach and co-workers used chlorpromazine (specific for clathrin), nystatin (specific for caveolin), and LY294002 (specific for macropinocytosis) to show that clathrinmediated endocytosis was the predominant mechanism for the Effects of a protein corona surrounding a nanoparticle. The corona constitutes a primary nanobio-interface that determines the fate of the nanoparticle and can have deleterious effects on the interactive proteins. Pre-existing or initial material characteristics contribute to the formation of the corona in biological environments. Characteristic protein attachment and/or detachment rates, competitive binding interactions, steric hindrance by detergents and adsorbed polymers, and the protein profile of the body fluid lead to dynamic changes of the corona.

Small caveolae-coated vesicles (50-80 nm) , also under the control of dynamin, are formed through flask-shaped invaginations in a nonspecific uptake process. Therefore, caveolin is an integral membrane protein responsible for the formation of caveolae and, consequently, the formation of invaginations through caveolin-1 expression. Its morphology and functions differ depending on the cell type. During internalization, caveolae are endocytosed together with vesicles. Caveolae are similar to lipid rafts, because they also comprise cholesterol and sphingolipids, as well as glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) and several kinases. In contrast to clathrin, caveolae-mediated endocytosis requires a signal to begin. Endocytosis starts with tyrosine phosphorylation of the associated protein, which leads to depolymerization and enlistment of actin [36] . This leads to escape from the endolysosome and to the direct exocytosis of drug carriers [33, 35] .",

The microfluidic device passes between single cells creating transient pores in the plasmatic membrane, which enhance the intracellular delivery via mechanoporation [44] . Its efficiency has already been demonstrated for the intracellular delivery of NPs loaded with dexamethasone; the authors also studied the effect of NP design on the fate of stem cells [45] .

By contrast, larger particles are removed by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), and those that are 200-300 nm become concentrated in the spleen [49, 50] . During internalization, larger particles (>1 mm) enter the cell via macropinocytosis; those that are >120 nm enter via the clathrin-dependent pathway; those that are 50-100 nm enter via the caveolae-dependent pathway and smaller particles (<50 nm) are internalized via the clathrin-and caveolae-independent pathway.

According to microscopy studies, PPS allows macromolecules to diffuse via the paracellular and transcellular pathways, improving their bioavailability by 45-fold [51] . In addition, polyacrylate, chitosan [52] , phytic acid [53] , and self-assembling lipid-like peptides [54] also work as enhancers, as well as thiomers and lectins [55] . These enhancers have the ability to reversibly open TJs, increasing the paracellular transport of macromolecular drugs because of the downregulation of occludin and claudin (TJ proteins), and the synergism of reductive effects of Ca 2+ [56, 57] . In terms of the latter, the cations bind with more affinity to polyacrylate derivatives, inhibiting lumen enzymes (e.g., trypsin). Thus, the polyacrylate-Ca 2+ complex triggers the opening of TJs [58, 59] . It was also demonstrated that cyclodextrin improves macromolecular absorption via pulmonary delivery [60] . Finally, an alternative strategy is the use of palmitoyl glycol chitosan hydrogels [61] or the development of liposomes with enhancers to delivery hydrophilic macromolecules [62] .",

These fatty acids increase hydrophilic transport and reduce transepithelial electrical resistance, indicating the opening of TJs [74] . Paracellular transport has been related, in several papers, to the transport of poorly absorbed drugs. A study revealed the relation between paracellular transport and fatty acids and their effects on the absorption of mannitol, a paracellular marker, and on morphology changes of TJs [75] .

Nanocrystals have the ability to be loaded with high amounts of drug, which makes them an ideal way of obtaining pharmacological effects [82] . CNCs with PEI have been developed to delivery small interfering (si)RNA for gene silencing. As an antitumor strategy, this formulation protected the siRNA and facilitated its delivery into tumor cells via endosomal escape or the 'proton sponge effect' [84] . In another study, the effect of unmodified CNCs and their cationic derivatives was evaluated in mitochondria stress. The authors revealed that these compounds induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and an immune response [83] . The beneficial effect of nonfunc-tionalized CNCs was also demonstrated by adding them to b-lactoglobulin to prolong stability at low pH [85] . In addition, the surface pH influences the affinity, agglomeration, and aggregation of nanomaterials. According to some results, surface pH affects phagocytosis and cellular homeostasis, whereby TF-2 was able to trigger inflammatory responses at acid pH whereas TF-1, with a basic pH, suppressed the release of cytokines [86] . In terms of cellular internalization, nanocrystals enter cells through passive diffusion [87] or even by endocytosis [88, 89] .",

For instance, porous NPs are characterized by a high loading capacity, chemical and physical robustness, low toxicity, and easy and cheap production. They can be divided into mesoporous silica NPs (MSNs) and porous silicon NPs (PSiNP) [91, 92] . In both types, it is possible to avoid the prior release of drugs by controlling the binding affinity with cargos. Gatekeepers (e.g., AuNPs) can be attached to the pore outlets via covalent bonds that can be broken by an externally applied stimulus (e.g., light, magnetic field, ultrasound, or temperature) or by an internal stimulus inherent to the treated pathology (excluding acid or basic environments and the presence of enzymes) [13] . For instance, silica-encapsulated solid lipid (SESL) particles were developed for cinnarizine (CIN) delivery to overcome the limited oral absorption of this weakly basic drug because of its pH dependency under intestinal conditions [93] . Another example of inorganic NPs are QDs, which can be rapidly taken up by macrophages, and have the ability to move around the cytoplasm and target nuclear histones via nuclear pore complexes [94] . Despite their small size (2-10 nm), this ability is due to the charge associated with the QDs. QDs are also theranostic, showing the potential to promote drug delivery into cells [95] .

Liposomes comprise 3-4 nm of lamellar phospholipid bilayers, with a hydrophilic center and a hydrophobic part of the membrane containing amphiphilic molecules. Liposomes are taken up by monocytes and macrophages, which is an advantage if the aim is to modulate immunity [16, 101] .

Given that they are typically positively charged, CPPs, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and sialic acids, interact electrostatically with negatively charged cells, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and sialic acids, at the beginning of translocation [133] . A CPP-adaptor fusion protein, TAT-calmodulin (TAT-CaM), has been developed that results in efficient intracellular delivery and endosomal escape. In this example, there is reversible and high-affinity noncovalent binding that delivers the cargo into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells [134] . Other researchers have used analogs of the CPP transportan10 conjugated with NPs to transport siRNA, concluding that the pH change leads to more efficient delivery, given that the positive charges are responsible for the stability of the complex [135] .",

Glycans act as receptor-like structures allowing lectins to bind directly to epithelial cells, via cytoadhesion, which can result in the transcytosis of larger molecules [137] . A previous study reported that 15 out of 32 lectins analyzed [e.g., Erythrina crista-galli lectin (ECL), Lycopersicon esculentum lectin (LEL), and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)] bound to the apical membranes of airway epithelium and were taken up by endocytosis [138] . WGA was analyzed further and shown to have cytoadhesive and cytoinvasive properties, which facilitated the transport of high-molecular-weight molecules. This lectin binds to N-acetyl-glucosamine and sialic acid and improves the binding and uptake of protein-based drugs [139, 140] .",

Polyamine-based (e.g., PEI [20, 36] ) polymers have a pKa of approximately 5-7, which leads to the increased influx of ions via the inflow of water and consequently endosomal membrane rupture. In NP-endosome membrane fusion, fusogenic lipids are incorporated in the carriers. Fusogenic lipids comprise mainly alanine and glycine, as well as certain hydrophobic residues. For instance, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) is acid responsive, such that the acid pH drives glutamate and aspartate protonation, resulting in a new hexagonal conformational. This facilitates the insertion of fusogenic lipids between juxtaposed membranes and distroys the lipid packing [20, 36] . In pore formation, after peptides bind in a-helical structure, they are obliquely inserted into the hydrophobic core of endosomal membrane, which stabilizes the transmembrane pore, and are then oriented via their hydrophilic structures. However, this does not happen during membrane disruption. In this instance, peptides bind to the hydrophilic part of phospholipids and undergo reorientation of their hydrophobic residues, resulting in an amphipathic a-helical structure, which allows peptides to cover the membrane like a carpet and causing disintegration by micellization of the membrane [36] .",

Other examples include hydrophobic amino acid R groups to aid viral escape from endosomes [147] ; Ca 2+ -siRNA nanocomplexes, where electrotastic interactions lead to siRNA release into the cytoplasm [148] ; and TMab4 variants, which resulted in a threefold improved endosomal escape via membrane pores [144] .

            "text": "When nanomaterials escape endosomes, they enter the cytoplasm or exit through the ER or Golgi complex. The cytoplasmic route is generally avoided because most drugs must enter the blood circulation to exert their pharmacological functions [146] . In addition to the difficulty in exiting cells from the basolateral side, nanomaterials also face degradation factors, such as enzymes, in cytoplasm [10] . Those nanomaterials that have an intracellular destiny utilize ER and Golgi routes as well as the retrograde trafficking pathway. This route is responsible for recycling several molecules, such as Pathways of receptor endocytosis. Endocytosis involves the capture of transmembrane proteins and their extracellular ligands into cytoplasmic vesicles that are pinched off from the plasma membrane. The best-studied pathway of receptor internalization is mediated by clathrin-coated pits. These are small areas of the plasma membrane that are covered on the cytoplasmic surface with clathrin triskelions, which comprise three clathrin heavy chains and three clathrin light chains assembled into a polyhedral clathrin lattice. Receptors are recruited to clathrin-coated pits by directly interacting with the clathrin coat adaptor complex AP2 or by binding to other adaptor proteins, which in turn interact with the clathrin heavy chain and/or AP2. Clathrin-coated pits invaginate inwards with the help of several accessory proteins and pinch off to form clathrin-coated vesicles in a process that requires the GTPase dynamin. Several clathrin-independent pathways of endocytosis also exist, although the precise mechanisms and structural components involved in these pathways are not well understood. Endocytic vesicles derived from both clathrin-dependent and -independent endocytosis fuse with early endosomes. Endosomal trafficking is controlled by several Rab proteins, which are small GTP-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily. Each GTP-bound Rab protein resides in a particular type of endosome and functions by recruiting specific effector proteins. Following their internalization into early RAB5-containing endosomes, receptors can rapidly recycle back to the plasma membrane by a RAB4-dependent mechanism, traffic to the recycling compartment that contains RAB11A, or remain in endosomes, which mature into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and late endosomes. MVBs are defined by the presence of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), which are formed by inward membrane invagination involving endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) complexes. Early-to-late endosome maturation involves the acquisition of RAB7 and the removal of endosomal components that are capable of, and necessary for, recycling. In the MVBs, cargo destined for degradation is incorporated into ILVs. Fusion of late endosomes and MVBs with lysosomes carrying proteolytic enzymes results in cargo degradation.

ER and Golgi complexs are important for both secretory and endocytic pathways, and are also an option to escape the acidic lysosomal environment [12] . Yu and colleagues found a trafficking pathway between the ER and plasmatic membrane (PM), and then from the PM to ER via the Golgi complex. This trafficking was controlled by retromer-mediated endocytic recycling in the Golgi pathway [150] . Binding to the class A receptor enables internalization by caveolae-mediated endocytosis or the lipid raft-mediated pathway [11] . In early endosomes, the nanocarrier content is delivered into the ER, Golgi complex, mitochondria, or even outside the cells [151] . Syntaxin-6 [present in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and early endosomes] has an important role in retrograde trafficking because of its tyrosine-based sorting motif, which regulates post-Golgi transport and the delivery of certain components, such as caveolin-1, into the membrane. The inhibition of syntaxin-6 proportionally decreases caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Thus, the transport of lipidic classes depends on syntaxin-6 [152] . In addition, syntaxin-6 also interferes with retrograde trafficking of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (in pancreatic b cells) and insulinresponsive membrane proteins (in endocrine cells) to lysosomes, the TGN, and the insulin-responsive compartment. Du and collaborators demonstrated the movement of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to the Golgi complex via microtubuledependent movement and its fusion with the complex via syntaxin-6. They also verified that the translocation is necessary for future fusion with the nucleus, which represents a pathway from the cell surface to the Golgi complex or even the nucleus [153] . Thus, this pathway would be preferred for nucleus-targeted delivery rather than diffusing throughout the cytoplasm [20] .",

Another interesting approach is the use of NPs containing a PEG-benzoic imine-oligo-L-lysine/iridium (III) metallodrug complex with pH-activated size reduction. Thus, at pH 7, they are large and protected by a PEG shell, whereas, at the acid pH of endosomes, NPs remain small because of the dissociation and detachment of PEG.

They are responsible for cellular homeostasis and, thus, are a good target to interfere with via oxidative phosphorylation, apoptosis, production of ROS, intracellular signaling, and metabolism. Thus, it is unsurprising that mitochondria contribute to obesity, Alzheimer's disease, neurodegeneration, cancer, diabetes mellitus, and cardiomyopathy, given that polymorphisms or mutations that occur in mitochondrial DNA result in deficient energy production. Therefore, lipophilicity and positive charges are required for mitochondrial targeting. The internal negative membrane potential of this organelle is a possible target for positively charged particles [7] . Mitochondriotropic molecules can be used to accumulate nanomaterials inside the cell, because they are amphiphilic. These molecules have the ability to escape endosomes and deliver their cargo into mitochondria [10] . Nanoformulations can be guided by mitochondrial processing proteinases (MPP), which process mitochondrial targeting sequences (MTSs) [162] . DQA, MTS, CdSe/ZnS QD, MITO-porter, PLGA-b-PEGTPP, and lipophilic cations are potential methods for use in this approach [7] . Recently, mitochondria targeting of cancer cells was attempted using a HA protective shell encapsulated with gold nanostars (AuNs) and DOX. The formulation was shown to be internalized via the CD44 receptor. Coated to the AuNs was triphenylphosphinemodified a-helical pro-apoptotic peptide (TPP-KLA), which loca-lizes to mitochondria, interrupt their membranes, inducing dysfunction and, thus, apoptosis [163] . Folate-coated chitosan NPs loaded ursolic acid have also been proposed as an antibreast cancer drug. It was confirmed that these NPs were internalized via a folatereceptor mediated endocytotic pathway. After destroying the permeability of lysosomal membrane, NPs were localized into mitochondria, resulting in the overproduction of ROS, destroying the mitochondrial membrane potential and causing apoptosis of the cancer cells [164] . Several polymeric conjugations are now available, especially for cancer. Chitosan has also been used to reach mitochondria by conjugating it with mitochondria-targeting ligand triphenylphosphine (TPP) to deliver ionidamine and siRNA and to trigger the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway [165] . Thus, the most appropriate way to target mitochondria and the metabolic pathway is to coat nanomaterials with mitochondrial targeting signals and/or peptides conjugated with proapoptotic drugs.",

It is also responsible for controlling drug detoxification, apoptosis, immune responses, and signaling pathways. It is also is where peptides are loaded to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and antigens are delivered, thus it acts as a presentation site [10] . Protein transport is mediated by a KDEL sequence that works as a localization signal, which is recognized by its receptor (KDEL-R), expressed in ER. Thus, the ER is an appropriate pharmaceutical target, using a biomimetic approach. Another method for ER targeting is the use of localization signals or antibodies against ER receptors that lead to ER stress, protein misfolding and aggregation, calcium homeostasis disturbance, and exposure to free radicals [7] . Associated with ER dysfunctions are infectious and protein-folding diseases, diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular diseases [154] . Murugan and colleagues developed mesoporous silica NP pores loaded with topotecan and coated with poly (acrylic acid)-chitosan conjugated with quercetin. This approach resulted in breast cancer cell death because of structural changes in organelles such as the ER, nucleus, and mitochondria [166] . For the treatment of diabetes, the imaging O 2 \u00c0 using two photon fluorescent probes (ER-BZT) followed by treatment with metformin has been proposed. Given that the production of ROS leads to ER stress and disease formation [167] , it was found that the natural compound jaceosidin contributes to sarco-ER Ca 2+ -ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) upregulation, decreasing ER stress [168] . Targeting the liposomal ER, phospholipids, KDEL sequence, and KDEL-R antibodies are reviewed elsewhere [7] .",

The main function of the Golgi complex is N-or O-glycosylation, and protien transport and sorting, in addition to its influence on lipid biosynthesis [169] . The TGN is in the center of both the endocytic and exocytic pathways, with an important role in straightening lipids and proteins. It is normally associated with ER, given that different cargos are transported from there to the cis-Golgi network and then to TNG, where cargos are sorted and forwarded to their destinations [170] . Matsuto and colleagues demonstrated that BICD2 enables Rab6A binding to the Golgi complex. They also showed that Rab6A and BICD2 are responsible for the fusion between Golgi tubules and the ER in retrograde trafficking [171] . It is unsurprising that Golgi complex dysfunctions contributes to various diseases, such as Alzheimer's, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes [154] . In 2011, a Golgi complex-targeting signal was discovered in a coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome. It was shown that, in the cytoplasmic tail, there is a beta-hairpin structural motif that controls Golgi complex localization [172] . Exploiting this motif could be a way of improving the targeting of the Golgi complex. Banfield has also described several mechanisms of protein retention in the Golgi complex, such as kin recognition, transmembrane domain-mediated and amino acid sequence motifs, which could also be targeted for drug delivery [169] .",

However, in terms of the latter, drugs are diffusing and interact randomly with organelles. For instance, siRNA acts in the cytoplasm, as do nanomaterials that have high metabolic stability [173] . SH3 and SH2 of SLAP can be delivered into the cytoplasm to inhibit T cell receptors, which can be useful for the treatment of autoimmune diseases [174] . Typically, this organelle is targeted when infectious and autoimmune diseases and familial hypercholesterolemia occur [8] . There are several approaches available that allow the delivery of nanomaterials into the cytoplasm, such as CPPs [175] and cationic nanomaterials [176] . Liposomes with fusogenic properties [177] or that are pH sensitive have also been studied as drug carriers [178] , given that they have the ability to destabilize endosomal membranes and release drugs into the cytoplasm [9] . The use of polyampholyte NPs and freeze concentration has been suggested to deliver proteins into the cytoplasm [174] , as has the application of a faded electric treatment for siRNA delivery [179] via connectosomes and diffusion across TJs [180] , bubble liposomes and ultrasound [181] . Enzyme-sensitive or redox-responsive linkers responsible for degradation of cell membrane have also been reported [7] . Given the nanomaterial parameters described above, the most ideal route of delivery remains the oral route [81] . Currently 43 drugs have been approved as nanopharmaceuticals (reviewed in [182] ). For example, for intracellular applications, Feraheme TM (Ferumoxytol) was approved in 2009 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat the iron deficiency anemia in adults with chronic kidney disease. This nanopharmaceutical comprises SPIONS coated with dextran, and the iron is released inside macrophages, from where it is then added to the intracellular storage iron pool or transferred to plasma transferrin. In 2014, Plegridy 1 (Biogen), a polymer-protein conjugate (PEGylated IFN beta-1a) with improved protein stability due to PEGylation, was approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. This drug binds to type I interferon receptors on the surface of cells and causes intracellular events that lead to the regulation of interferon-responsive gene expression. Similarly, in 2015, Onivyde 1 (liposomal Irinotecan) was approved by the FDA for treating pancreatic cancer, because it increases the intracellular uptake of irinotecan and reduces the systemic toxicity arising from adverse effects (www.fda.gov/).

However, there are several parameters that must be taken into account, such as their size, charge, composition, and shape, because these are correlated with cell uptake, long circulation times, renal clearance, and drug stability. As discussed above, there are various obstacles that must be overcome for successful drug delivery, culminating in the final step characterized by endosomal escape, organelle location, and membrane translocation. Some drugs require delivery to a specific organelle, increasing the delivery challenge. It is evident that organelle dysfunction is the origin of several diseases; therefore, one treatment strategies is to target a set of organelles to reach the desired therapeutic effect. Future nanoformulations should aim to exploit the most successful approaches described above to result in safe, effective and targeted drug delivery. As detailed in Fig. 5 , the ideal nanoformulation would have a positive surface charge and ligand affinity to improve endocytosis, enabling them to follow the retrograde pathway to avoid lysosomal degradation or to escape to endosomes. Finally, a biomimetic strategy could be a way to improve intracellular transport and/or exocytosis. Nevertheless, we require a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying intracellular transport and the integrity of nanomaterials during and after drug release.",
