Factors to consider are the transmissibility of the particular agent via transfusion, the consequence of acquiring the agent to the recipient and the prevalence of the agent in the region where the donor lives or travels. Once infectious agents for screening are selected, the appropriate test must be selected. Typically, screening tests are tests with high sensitivity and are used because the incidence of false negativity is low. Confirmatory tests have high specificity and a low incidence of false positivity. Cost is another factor to be considered, because screening for an exorbitant number of diseases may make blood-component therapy cost prohibitive. Efforts to minimize potential exposure to infectious diseases by controlling the environments of donors (ie, minimize travel and exposure to new animals) and initiating ectoparasite prevention programs are necessary.",

In the United States, there are several viral diseases that all units are tested for before administration. All potential donors complete detailed questionnaires, the results of which may exclude individuals based on their history of travel and sexual behavior. Although tick-borne diseases are not currently routinely screened for, a recent increase in human exposure to tick pathogens has lead to reinvestigation of this practice. Elimination of human donors because of travel history or region within the United States is impractical. The potential for subclinical disease carriers and the possibility that the testing could be performed during the incubation period of the disease further complicates screening for tick-borne pathogens. Also, many people who acquire tick-borne diseases have no recollection of tick exposure and there is a similar potential in pets. 4 Similar concerns occur when selecting small animal donors.",

For closed colonies, this frequency should be adequate; for volunteer donors, annual testing should be performed. All donors involved must receive monthly ectoparasite prophylaxis to limit exposure to vectors of disease transmission. When screening donors, it is essential to obtain a very thorough travel history before each donation to determine if additional infectious agents should be considered.

Detection of Ehrlichia spp. DNA by PCR confirms current infection. However, in recent PCR-based studies, E. canis was not detected in the blood of feral cats in north central Florida, 13 nor in the blood of cats used as blood donors in the United States. 14 In addition, there have been no reports of feline ehrlichiosis acquired via blood transfusion.

To lessen the risk of exposure to these agents, community-practice-based blood-donor cats should be housed indoors and tick control maintained if indicated. Although clinically ill cats respond to doxycycline or imidocarb treatment, it is unknown whether infection is eliminated.

Experimentally, B. henselae the organism has been transmitted between cats by C. felis and by intravenous, subcutaneous (SQ), intramuscular, and intradermal (ID) inoculation. Naturally exposed cats and their fleas are commonly PCR positive for B. henselae and B. clarridgeaie. 17 A serologic survey of the United States and Western Canada revealed that overall, 27.9% of healthy pet cats were seropositive, with regional ranges varying from 6.9% to 56% ( Table 1 ). 19 In a study of cats used as community-practice blood donors in the United States, 2 of 118 cats were PCR positive for B. henselae. 14 After infection by B. henselae, most cats become seropositive, with a variable duration of bacteremia. Transient fever, anorexia, uveitis, and peripheral lymphadenopathy are the most common clinical abnormalities recognized in both experimentally infected and naturally exposed cats. 20 Currently, the association between B. henselae and other clinical diseases of cats, such as gingivitis, is being explored. To date, an association between feline blood transfusion and clinical bartonellosis has not been made.",

[22] [23] [24] These bacteria are associated with feline infectious anemia and can result in fever and severe hemolytic anemia in infected cats. 24 Most M. hemofelis isolates are more pathogenic than M. hemominutum isolates, but only limited numbers of isolates have been studied. 25, 26 Both hemoplasmas have been detected in the blood of cats and C. felis taken from their bodies. 17 The cat flea has been shown to be a competent vector for M. hemofelis. 27 As little as 1 mL of blood from an chronically infected carrier cat can induce clinical illness in adult cats. 25, 26, 28 It is currently unknown how long stored feline blood containing hemoplasmas is infectious. A recent study of 118 community-practicebased blood-donor cats in the United States showed 14 to be carrying one or both hemoplasms. 14 There is no commercial serological test for feline hemoplasmosis. Cytological diagnosis is inaccurate in healthy cats, with both false-positive and false-negative results being common. It is well documented that the storage of whole blood in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid will lead to the organism falling off the associated red blood cell within 6 hours after storage. PCR is now considered the test of choice for screening cats for hemoplasmosis. A recent study documented positive results in 100% of experimentally inoculated cats versus 37.5% positive on peripheral blood smear from the same cats. 26 PCR assays that amplify the DNA of both species are currently available commercially. 29 Cats to be used as community-practice blood donors should be screened for both hemoplasmas by PCR. If negative, then flea control should be maintained while the cat is being used as a blood donor. If found to be positive for either species, then the cat should be excluded from the blood-donor program, because treatment with tetracyclines, azithromycin, or enrofloxacin does not consistently lead to the elimination of bacteremia. 25, 26, 28 Dogs Vector-borne diseases represent the greatest challenge for deciding what organisms to include in a screening panel. The incidence of individual diseases varies considerably in each region of the United States. In North Carolina, for example, an investigation found that all dogs in one kennel had at least one tick-borne disease and many of them had several. 30 The reported incidence of transmission of these organisms via transfusion in dogs is very low, so a cost-benefit ratio should be considered when making the final decision.",

Dogs with ehrlichiosis will most commonly present with depression, lethargy, mild weight loss, and anorexia. Potential exists for bleeding disorders. Many assymptomatic dogs will seroconvert after exposure. Clinical signs may develop months to years after initial exposure, or they may never occur. This provides the greatest challenge when screening potential blood donors. Serology (IFA) is the most widely used test for diagnosing ehrlichiosis. Dogs with titers of \u03fe1:80 are considered suspect for having ehrlichiosis and should be excluded from donor programs. Recently, a commercial ELISA test kit has become available for E. canis for in-hospital use (Snap 3Dx-IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME). This test has been shown to have overall agreement of 91% when compared with the IFA test, although its sensitivity was lower when titers were \u03fd1:320. 31 Interestingly, this test is combined with an assay for Dirofilaria immitis and Borrelia burgdorfi. It may be more cost effective to use this test during the initial screening. Dogs that have a negative result with the Snap 3Dx should have an IFA titer run to assure a negative titer. Ideally, genus specific RT-PCR should be performed on dogs that are seronegative on IFA. 11 Donor dogs should be treated with ectoparasite prophylaxis in an attempt to minimize exposure to potential vectors.",
