Although the sex ratio among MERS cases appeared biased towards males, there was some evidence -as shown belowthat more females were exposed.

For visitors, while most of the younger cases were males, the age group wuth the highest number of female cases was 60-69 years. One possible reason for this might be differences in perceptions and behaviours related to hygienic measures as observed in the influenza A(H1N1) There are several limitations to this analysis which have to be considered. We provide only a preliminary analysis of the available data to generate initial hypotheses about sex-specific differences for the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea. Case-based data on other potential risk factors were not available. Also, denominators for the exposure groups by sex were unknown. However, this initial assessment could have immediate implications for disease prevention and control. In addition to more targeted prevention measures, future clinical and epidemiological studies on MERS should include sex and gender-specific analysis, as comparing groups with different proportions of male or female subjects may introduce confounding effects.",
