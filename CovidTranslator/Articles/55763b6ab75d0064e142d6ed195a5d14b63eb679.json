We found that cholesterol depletion from the cellular membrane by methyl-\u2424-cyclodextrin (M\u2424CD) significantly impaired the efficiency of TGEV infection. Infectivity was also reduced after depleting cholesterol from the viral envelope. This finding is surprising because coronaviruses bud from a pre-Golgi compartment which is expected to be low in cholesterol compared to the plasma membrane. Addition of exogenous cholesterol resulted in a restoration of the infectivity confirming our conclusion that efficient TGEV infection requires cholesterol in both the viral and the cellular membranes. Our data raise the possibility that the viral and cellular proteins involved in the entry process may be associated with cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains.",

TGEV, a member of the family Coronaviridae, is a pleomorphic enveloped virus with a positive-stranded RNA genome (Spaan et al., 1988) and four structural proteins: the spike (S) protein, the integral membrane (M) glycoprotein, the minor envelope (E) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein (Laude et al., 1993; Spaan et al., 1988) . The coronavirus surface protein S is a major viral antigen and its binding to the cellular receptor porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) is required for the initial stage of a TGEV infection including the attachment step and the subsequent membrane fusion event (Delmas et al., 1992; Winter et al., 2006) . Membrane microdomains enriched in glycosphingolipids, cholesterol and certain proteins (for a review, see Schuck and Simons, 2004) , also designated lipid rafts, have been described for cells from mammals, Drosophila, Dictyostelium and yeast (Drevot et al., 2002) . Accumulating evidence indicates that membrane microdomains are important in the process of virus infection. Particularly, cholesterol, a critical structural component of lipid rafts, plays an important role in different aspects of the life cycle of several viruses (Imhoff et al., 2007) .",

Entry of enveloped viruses into cells involves binding to specific receptors and fusion of the viral membrane with a cellular membrane. Successful virus entry may require cholesterol in either of the two membranes involved or in both. Previous data show that the infectivity of influenza virus is sensitive to cholesterol depletion from the viral membrane (reviewed by Smith and Helenius, 2004) . More recently we have shown that canine distemper virus infection also requires cholesterol in the viral envelope (Imhoff et al., 2007) . In contrast, murine leukemia virus, Ebola virus and Marburg virus are sensitive to cholesterol depletion from the cellular membrane (Bavari et al., 2002; Lu et al., 2002) . In the case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpes simplex virus, cholesterol is required in both membranes (reviewed by Smith and Helenius, 2004; Nayak and Hui, 2004) , while vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication is not affected by cholesterol depletion.",

Apart from various cellular processes, lipid rafts have been reported to play a critical role in different aspects of the virus life cycle such as viral entry, protein transport and targeting, and assembly and budding (Nayak and Hui, 2004) . Cholesterol is a characteristic structural component of lipid rafts. Cholesterol depletion may therefore result in disorganization of these membrane microdomains (Scheiffele et al., 1997) . The drug methyl-\u2424-cyclodextrin, a cholesterol depleting reagent can reduce the cholesterol content and cause disorganization of lipid rafts efficiently.

            "text": "In this study, we were especially interested in understanding whether cholesterol is required for TGEV infection and if so, whether cholesterol is important as a constituent of the virus, of the host cells or of both. To address this question, we used M\u2424CD as cholesterol depleting agent to treat either TGEV or swine testicle (ST) cells prior to virus infection. Our results show that depletion of cholesterol from either the viral or the cellular membrane resulted in a decrease of the infectivity of TGEV on ST cells. The concentration of M\u2424CD and cholesterol we used in this study do not produce significant adverse effect on cell viability as shown by trypan blue staining (data not shown). The drug concentration and the protocol applied are similar to those described for the analysis of other viruses (Nayak and Hui, 2004; Imhoff et al., 2007) . Other members of the family Coronaviridae, MHV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and IBV (Thorp and Gallagher, 2004; Nomura et al., 2004; Li et al., 2007; Imhoff et al., 2007) are sensitive to M\u2424CD treatment of host cells. Therefore, the importance of cholesterol-rich microdomains appears to be a general feature of the entry mechanism coronaviruses have developed. In the case of TGEV, the cholesterol dependence is consistent with the presence of porcine aminopeptidase N in detergent-resistant membrane microdomains. This holds also true for the human coronavirus 229E which interacts with human aminopeptidase N. MHV and SARS-CoV use different receptors, MHVR and ACE2, respectively. Surprisingly, both of these receptors have been reported to be nonraft-proteins (Thorp and Gallagher, 2004; Warner et al., 2005) . However, MHVR has been shown to redistribute to some extent into lipid rafts after interaction with MHV (Choi et al., 2005) . Thus, cholesterol-rich microdomains may contribute to coronavirus entry either by providing platforms for efficient virus binding to receptors presented in these membrane domains or by recruiting virus-receptor complexes to promote the entry process. We have shown that cholesterol is important not only in the host cell membrane but also in the viral membrane. This finding may be surprising because coronaviruses mature by a budding process at a pre-Golgi compartment at the transition from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus (Tooze et al., 1984) . At the early compartments of the secretory pathway, the content of cholesterol and sphingolipids is lower compared to the plasma membrane. Therefore, the cholesterol content of coronaviruses is expected to be lower than that of viruses budding from the plasma membrane. Nevertheless, even the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum has been shown to contain lipid microdomains (Sevlever et al., 1999) . At present we do not know how cholesterol in the viral membrane affects virus infectivity. However, our results raise the possibility that lipid microdomains exist in the membrane of coronaviruses. The low concentration of cholesterol may explain that the infectivity of TGEV is affected by concentrations of M\u2424CD that are lower than those that affect infectivity of viruses like HIV and influenza virus. Cholesterol treatment of TGEV without prior M\u2424CD treatment did not affect virus infectivity (data not shown). It will be interesting in future studies to confirm the importance of viral cholesterol for other coronaviruses and to analyze the membrane microdomains in the coronavirus envelope.",
