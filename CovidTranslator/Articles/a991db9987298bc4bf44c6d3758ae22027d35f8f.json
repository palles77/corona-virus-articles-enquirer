Caused by coronavirus and spread by droplet transmission, 1-5 this disease and its high mortality rate have increased the psychological stress of all health care staff. 4 Various precautionary measures have been suggested. Universal precautionary measures were believed to be necessary, especially in certain high-risk areas such as obstetrics wards, where contact with body fluid is common. Health care workers demanded personal protective equipment (PPE). The labor ward and obstetrics operating theater of Queen Mary Hospital, which is a tertiary center, adopted universal precautions in May 2003. Previously, only surgical gowning, single gloving, paper cap, surgical face mask, and boots were worn in the delivery room. Since early May 2003, universal precautionary measures were implemented and changes in PPE are shown in Table 1 . Understandably, such measures would impose extra work, inconvenience, and burdens to the staff, and might hinder the effective and efficient execution of their work. A simple questionnaire survey was conducted 4 weeks after the implementation of the universal precautionary measures. Our objectives are to present the views of our front-line staff, and to discuss universal precaution measures in obstetrics.",

On the other hand, the support staff who clean the rooms believed that universal precautions were necessary. A number of explanations could be offered for this difference. First, our clinical staff may have been subconsciously assured that contact with SARS patients in the obstetric unit would be most unlikely, since obstetrics patients are mostly afebrile without any respiratory symptoms. The support staff does not have this knowledge. Second, the PPE hindered the efficient care of pregnant women. Goggles, eye shields, and multilayered protective clothing distort visual acuity and induce intense perspiration in the medical/nursing staff who had to be with women in labor for many hours. In contrast, the support staff only had to wear the PPE when they cleaned a room, which usually took less than 15 minutes. Visual distortion and heat generated by the PPE then would not be as problematic for support staff, who stated that they felt they were being protected more than peers on other wards. Third, medical/nursing staff were already accustomed to some form of protective clothing during their daily activities in the ward and operating theater. They might already feel protected from contamination by patients. Additional PPE might then be considered superfluous, depending on the area they worked in and their specific duties. Satisfaction levels with PPE were lower among labor ward staff than among operating theater staff, who were more accustomed to full infection protection. The occupational specialty mindset was very important, not only in terms of satisfaction with universal precautions, but also effective implementation.",

This discrepancy seems to be related to the comfort of the equipment. Goggles were deemed to be needed, but they were tight, foggy, and reduced visual acuity; hence, the low satisfaction rate. Paper hoods are comfortable, and hence respondents indicated a high satisfaction rate, but were not rated as highly necessary since head hair were not considered to be a transmission site. Gloving, gowning, and footwear were more consistent in levels of need and satisfaction. These have been the usual PPE that staff are accustomed to. This was a small study that aimed at appraising the effects on staff of universal precautions against SARS. It was not meant to produce figures reaching high levels of statistical power. Our findings should be important for health care managers to reassess the concept of universal precaution, and where and how it should be instituted. Unless this is done, universal precautions will not be implemented effectively, staff will not be protected, and managers will have a false sense of security.",
