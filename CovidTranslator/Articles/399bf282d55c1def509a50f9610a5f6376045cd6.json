S. aureus accounts for more superficial and invasive infections than any other bacteria, leading to considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide (Hakim et al., 2007; Haupt et al., 2008) . A number of S. aureus surface proteins enable the microbe to adhere to and invade the host cells, as well as to evade immune defence mechanisms (Bur et al., 2013) . Clumping factor A (ClfA) is categorized as a member of the microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMM) family and has been shown to be a major virulence factor in many animal models, including being the most crucial cell-surfaceanchored virulence factor in S. aureus-induced sepsis (McAdow et al., 2011) . ClfA mediates adhesion of S. aureus to host tissues by binding to extracellular matrix proteins such as fibrinogen (McCormack et al., 2014) , and it participates in impeding macrophage phagocytosis, as well as in stimulating platelet aggregation and fibrin clot formation (Kerrigan et al., 2008; Palmqvist et al., 2004) . Our laboratory has previously shown that ClfA can recruit the plasma complement regulatory protein factor I, resulting in inhibition of complement-mediated opsonophagocytosis (Hair et al., 2008 (Hair et al., , 2010 .",

            "text": "Plasma apolipoproteins (Apos) are central therapeutic targets as they play a vital role in macrophage biology and metabolic disorders (Sigel et al., 2012) . Interestingly, human nasal fluid contains all major lipid classes as well as ApoA-I, which contribute in the inherent antibacterial activity of human mucosal defence (Do Carmo et al., 2008) . Moreover, the host immune response was enhanced by high-density lipoprotein components and phagocytic activity was markedly improved by ApoA in particular (Tanaka et al., 2010) . Some Apos can interfere with the S. aureus switch from colonizing to invasive pathogen by antagonizing the S. aureus quorum-sensing system that upregulates genes required for invasive infection. This antagonism is mediated by the binding of ApoB to S. aureus autoinducing pheromone, preventing attachment of this pheromone to the bacterial cell and subsequently suppressing signal transduction through its receptor (Peterson et al., 2008) . Sera of familially hypercholesterolaemic patients, with elevated ApoB, could suppress lipoteichoic acid (LTA)-induced inflammation in humans through its binding to LTA of S. aureus (Sigel et al., 2012) . As a part of innate immune responses to infection, human serum ApoB binds and masks the quorum-signalling molecule of S. aureus, auto-inducing peptide (AIP), leading to transcriptional downregulation of agr expression in S. aureus (James et al., 2013) . Human serum ApoA and ApoC directly inhibit the growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci in vitro and promote innate defence mechanisms of normal and immunocompromised individuals (Tada et al., 1993) . Although ApoD may not play a role in S. aureus infection, it has neuroprotective function against human coronavirus-induced encephalitis (Do Carmo et al., 2008) . Moreover, serum ApoH can bind staphylococcal Sbi cellsurface protein, which is expressed at diverse levels between different S. aureus strains (Zhang et al., 2011) .",

The number of peptides identified includes variants of the peptides that have different post-translational modifications or slightly different retention times. Thus, excluding the minor variants of the 44 peptides identified for ApoE, yielded nine significant peptides ( Table 2 ). The ApoE peptides were identified with high statistical significance (i.e. peptide score .30 and expect score ,0.05). The tandem MS data of these peptides showed continuous series of both b and y fragmentation ions, which further validated their identities. These peptides provide a coverage map of 38 %, demonstrating good coverage and a high degree of confidence in the identification (Fig. 2) .

ApoE possesses multiple immune regulatory functions, including modulation of macrophage functions, suppression of T cell proliferation, upregulation of the production of platelet nitric oxide and facilitation of lipid antigen presentation by CD1 molecules to natural killer T cells. Moreover, inflammatory cytokines can either upregulate or downregulate the production of ApoE in various tissue types, highlighting the complex roles of ApoE and cytokines in various diseases (Zhang et al., 2011) . ApoE is believed to mediate its non-lipid associated functions through binding to cell-surface receptors (Jofre-Monseny et al., 2008) . Earlier studies that employed ApoEdeficient mice revealed increased susceptibility to Klebsiella pneumoniae infection (de Bont et al., 1999) , as well as elevated mortality by Listeria monocytogenes, as compared to the wild-type mice (Roselaar & Daugherty, 1998) . Furthermore, serum ApoE-deficient mice demonstrated an inability to neutralize LPS and demonstrated considerably enhanced lethality by LPS-induced endotoxaemia as compared to the wild-type mice (Van Oosten et al., 2001) . ApoE deficiency was also associated with delayed emergence of adaptive immunity to tuberculosis and ApoE-deficient mice were extremely susceptible to tuberculosis (Martens et al., 2008) . A peptide analogue of the receptor-binding region of ApoE, ApoE dimer tandem repeat peptide (ApoE dp), could reproduce some of the biological properties of ApoE and demonstrated antimicrobial activities against S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, herpes simplex viruses, as well as human immunodeficiency virus. These biological activities were attributed in part to the prevention of early stages of microbial attachment to the mammalian cells (Dobson et al., 2006) . Moreover, a novel peptide derivative of human ApoE (ApoE dpL-W) showed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and noticeable antimicrobial activity against emerging S. aureus biofilms (Forbes et al., 2013 ).",

To confirm and elucidate the binding of human ApoE to ClfA, we utilized purified and serum ApoE, and evaluated their binding to rClfA through CEWA and dot blot assays. Furthermore, an isogenic ClfA-deficient S. aureus strain revealed statistically significant (P50.05) decreased binding to human serum ApoE compared to the wild-type ClfA-sufficient strain. Our Western blot analysis revealed that purified human ApoE bound to the bacterial cell surface of the wild-type ClfA-sufficient strain (ClfA + ), but no binding was detected with the isogenic ClfAdeficient strain (ClfA 2 ). Together, these data suggest that ApoE may be a novel ligand for ClfA.",

Linearity model of protein interaction depending on rClfA (0-2.6 mg) binding to ApoE in diluted human serum (20 %, v/v, human serum in TBS-BSA) as determined by SPSS, version 18.0 (SPSS) Calculations in the linearity model were based on the chemiluminescence densities obtained from immunodot-blot assays of serum ApoE binding to rClfA. Quantification of the chemiluminescence densities to the corresponding ApoE (mg) were performed using the ApoE calibration curve. (Hair et al., 2008) , which could potentially bind ApoE remote from the bacterial surface. In these scenarios, ClfA sequestration of ApoE could mediate a host defence evasion mechanism for S. aureus. The previous study with ApoE-derived peptides suggested that ApoE may possess an anti-biofilm effect on S. aureus as a host defence mechanism, potentially modulated by binding ClfA (Forbes et al., 2013) . Alternatively, it is also possible that ApoE binding to the virulence factor ClfA could potentially mask the virulence factor from interacting with other known ligands, fibrinogen or factor I; thus, moderating ClfA-mediated virulence. However, if ApoE binding to ClfA were a major mechanism of immunological control of S. aureus, then we would expect that ClfA-deficient strains should demonstrate increased virulence. The opposite is true: ClfA-deficient strains are markedly less virulent, suggesting that ApoE binding to ClfA is unlikely to contribute to immunological control of S. aureus. Thus, it appears more likely that S. aureus may sequester ApoE via ClfA as an immune evasion tactic or as a means to increase virulence via another mechanism.",
