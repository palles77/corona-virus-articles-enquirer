Regulatory T cells mediate maternal tolerance to the fetus. 1 CD4 \u00fe CD25 \u00fe regulatory T cells also inhibit antigenspecific T cell response, 2,3 and can reverse chronic allergeninduced inflammation and prevent airway remodeling. 4 IL-35, a heterodimeric hematopoietin of EpsteineBarr virusinduced gene 3 (EBI3) and the p35 subunit of IL-12, was identified as an anti-inflammatory and immuno-suppressive cytokine in 2007. 5 IL-35 is also an IL-12 family cytokine, and is reported to be produced mainly by Tregs. 5 IL-35 protein and mRNA levels in allergic asthmatics were shown to be lower than in healthy controls. 6 The frequencies of CD4 \u00fe CD25 \u00fe Foxp3 \u00fe Tregs and CD4 \u00fe IL-12p35 \u00fe T cells in allergic asthma patients were also found to be decreased. 6 Whitehead et al. showed that the production of IL-17, allergic airway hyperresponsiveness, and the numbers of macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) increased in mice deficient in Ebi-3, one of the IL-35 subunits. 7 Recently IL-35 has been reported to have an effect on BALF has been reported. 8e10 Huang et al. 8 showed that IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in BALF were inhibited by administration of plasmid DNA encoding recombinant single-chain IL-35. Dong et al. 9 also reported that administration of recombinant fusion protein of murine IL-35 and human Fc fragment (rIL-35) reduced eosinophil counts in BALF. Li et al. 10 documented a reduction in the numbers of inflammatory cells and levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-17 in BALF with administration of adenovirus expressing IL-35. These findings suggest that IL-35 can attenuate asthma. However, reports of IL-35 in relation to allergic rhinitis are very limited.",

(Shizuoka, Japan), were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA, grade V, SigmaeAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 2 mg Al (OH) 3 intraperitoneally twice on days 0 and 14. These mice were also challenged intranasally (i.n.) on days 21 through 27 with OVA (200 mg). Intranasal administration (40 ml saline) of 0.1 mg recombinant fusion protein of murine IL-35 and human IgG1 Fc fragment (rIL-35, Chimerigen Laboratories, San Diego, CA) was performed an hour before OVA intranasal challenge on days 21 through 27. In a preliminary experiment with administration of 0.01 mg and 0.1 mg of rIL-35, we determined that 0.1 mg was more suitable, because there were bigger differences between the rIL-35 group and the control groups in the experiment with 0.1 mg (data not shown). In the control groups, intranasal administration (40 ml saline) of recombinant human IgG1 Fc fragment (rFc, AdipoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) only (0.1 mg, rFc control group) or PBS only (PBS control group) was performed an hour before OVA intranasal challenge on days 21 through 27. A schematic protocol of immunization and treatment is shown in Figure 1 . rIL-35 and rFc were both produced in the same cells, CHO cells. Nasal tissue and cervical lymph nodes (CLN) were collected on day 28. Mice were housed in an environmentallycontrolled animal facility at Nagoya City University in Japan.

We also previously reported that rIL-35 enhanced IL-2 production in vitro. IL-2 is essential for induction of Foxp3 \u00fe regulatory T cells by TGF-beta, and can induce expansion of Foxp3 \u00fe regulatory T cells. 28, 29 Furthermore, IL-2 receptor betadependent STAT5 activation is required for the development of Foxp3\u00fe regulatory T cells. 30 The mechanism of immune response is complex in vivo. Considering the above, IL-35 may enhance Foxp3 gene expression through an increase the production of IL-2 and IL-10 indirectly, but not directly.",

However, Haeryfar et al. showed that Treg depletion significantly augmented CD8 \u00fe T cell responses, IFN-gamma production, and cytolytic activity in response to influenza virus. 31 Boettler et al. also reported that Treg suppressed influenza virusspecific CD8 \u00fe T cell proliferation. 32 Considering this, there is a risk that intranasal administration of IL-35 increases airway infection through facilitation of Tregs. In contrast, Terrada showed that injection of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA)-specific Treg controlled uveoretinitis, and deletion of Tregs exacerbated clinical signs of uveoretinitis. 33 Induced Tregs in coronaviral infection also protects against greater severity of the disease. 34 Anghelina et al. 35 showed that Tregs depletion resulted in increased mortality in coronavirus-induced acute encephalitis, and transfer of Tregs increased survival from 0% to 50%. At the moment, the association between Tregs and airway infection is unclear. The effect of Tregs on airway infections may vary depending on the situations. To elucidate the association between Tregs and airway infections, further studies are needed.",
