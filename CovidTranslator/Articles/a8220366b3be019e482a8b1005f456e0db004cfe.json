Reported residential postcode was used to locate cases, and clusters were identified using a scan statistic. Cases included in clusters were compared to those not included in such clusters with respect to human socioeconomic factors (postcode area relative socioeconomic disadvantage, economic resources, education and occupation) and dog factors (neuter status, breed, age, gender, vaccination status).",

Eleven (58%) clusters occurred between April and July, and the average cluster length was 5.7 days. All clusters occurred in postcodes with a significantly (P < 0.05) greater level of relative socioeconomic disadvantage and a lower rank in education and occupation, and it was noted that clustered cases were less likely to have been neutered (P = 0.004). No significant difference (P > 0.05) was found between cases reported from cluster postcodes and those not within clusters for dog age, gender, breed or vaccination status (although the latter needs to be interpreted with caution, since vaccination was absent in most of the cases). Further research is required to investigate the apparent association between indicators of poor socioeconomic status and clusters of reported canine parvovirus diseases; however these initial findings may be useful for developing geographically-and temporally-targeted prevention and disease control programs.",

Evidence of spatio-temporal disease clustering indicates that some common factor(s) are contributing to disease propagation in specific areas and that targeted prevention programs will probably be effective in reducing disease occurrence (Ward and Carpenter, 2000) . Analysis of data from the Disease WatchDog database may fill some of the current deficits in companion animal disease epidemiology (Ward and Kelman, 2011) .",

Specific aims were to analyse data from Disease WatchDog and describe the role that human socioeconomic indicators (relative socioeconomic disadvantage, access to economic resources, level of education, and occupation status) and dog factors (neuter status, breed, age, gender and vaccination status) might have played in the development of canine parvovirus-related disease clusters. We also wished to assess the role of geographical distribution of registered clinics in the formation of these clusters. The study endeavoured to further characterise canine parvoviral disease occurrence in Australia and provide insights into potential target areas for disease prevention.",

In addition, those with lower education levels and those living in greater relative socio-economic disadvantage are more likely to be obese (Pink, 2008; Courcier et al., 2010) . Studies reporting similar findings in companion animals are limited. However, previous research has indicated that owners with a higher education level (especially those with a professional qualification) generally provide a better standard of housing, feeding, and veterinary care for dogs than other owners and have greater knowledge of basic animal care based on survey responses from both pet owners and households that did not own a pet (Anene et al., 1996; Balassiano et al., 2009) .",

Although Australian data are inadequate, it is feasible that attention to pet health follows a similar trend, as has been reported elsewhere. Supporting this idea is the finding that reported cases of parvovirus that were located within clusters were three times less likely (P = 0.0040) to be neutered than those cases outside clusters. There are probably many reasons for neutering pets, but socio-economic factors (reduced financial resources and lower education level) are likely involved and further suggest that socio-economic status plays a role in local parvovirus outbreaks.",

Inadequate herd immunity seems a likely explanation and may arise because of a lack of regular virus transmission within the areas, or inadequate levels of vaccination. Several studies have found vaccination to be protective against development of the clinical disease but vaccination in these studies refers to compliance with a vaccination protocol capable of inducing protective antibody titres (Goddard and Leisewitz, 2010; Houston et al., 1996; Godsall et al., 2010; Twark and Dodds, 2000) . Less than 1% of dogs in the current study were reported as having received adequate vaccination against canine parvovirus as determined by the WSAVA vaccination guidelines. 4 Although the findings in our study suggest that vaccination status (as well as gender, age and breed) did not play a significant role in the formation of disease clusters, information on vaccination status was limited (0.04% or less of all cases -whether within or outside clusters -had been vaccinated within 12 months of infection). The association between clusters and dog neuter status might represent the influence of socioeconomic factors on general veterinary cases and reduced financial resources and lower education level probably influenced an owner's decision whether to neuter and/or to vaccinate their pet. Areas of lower socioeconomic status should be targeted in programs to control canine parvovirus.",

The main constraint to this study was that the baseline population demographics for dogs in Australia were largely unknown, and the small amount of data that is available is usually specific to a local area (Toribio et al., 2009) . The absence of a control population makes it difficult to draw conclusions regarding analysis of diseased populations because there is no baseline data against which to make comparisons.

More specifically, any one of these factors might result in local parvovirus disease outbreaks -for example, an area (several postcodes) in which there are a greater proportion of young dogs could be more susceptible to an outbreak of parvovirus, irrespective of the various socioeconomic factors we assessed. However, there was no evidence of age, gender or breed explaining the clusters identified. Another major limitation the study was the use of data collected within a passive surveillance system. Moore and Lund (2009) commented that passive surveillance systems have a number of drawbacks, including a high rate of underreporting, incomplete reporting, increased chance of reporting bias, and commonly the lack of a population at risk. Underreporting is a concern in any surveillance system; Godsall et al. (2010) observed that reporting compliance (5.9%) of staff was significantly lower than expected in a study in which data came from one group of hospitals under the same management in the UK. Reporting bias is difficult to assess because reporting of canine parvovirus is not mandatory and some clinics may be more diligent at reporting than others.",
