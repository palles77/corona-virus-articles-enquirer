The size of the LUVs was determined by DLS and the The leakage assay is a technique that permits the detection of changes in membrane 192 permeability. It is based on the self-quenching ability of the fluorophore CF when it is highly 193 concentrated. The CF was encapsulated within LUVs at enough concentration to be self-194 quenched and the LUVs were exposed to different concentrations of AgNPs. The ITO   211   slides were then assembled into an electroformation chamber each in contact with a copper   212   tape and separated by a Teflon gasket. The chamber was filled with a 300 mM sucrose   213 solution (300 mOsm kg -1 ) and connected to a function generator to apply an AC electric field.",

We propose that single AgNPs do not possess enough energy to bend the membrane, 513 nonetheless the formation of NP clusters of a particular size and shape will increase their 514 ability to deform the membrane and produce invaginations and ILVs. The formation of these 515 structures removes excess membrane, which, along with the pressure generated by the 516 AgNPs that adhere onto the membrane, increases the membrane tension and can lead to 517 membrane poration 46 . The increase in membrane tension is also known to be the driving 518 force of opening of pores which will in turn produce membrane permeation, causing the The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

However, the aggregation of AgNPs would lead to two different possibilities: i) 564 large aggregates precipitate and are expelled from the solution and do not interact with the 565 membrane. These large aggregates are expected to be highly toxic because they are more 566 difficult to be transported in the blood and can be accumulated in certain organs before 567 reaching their specific targets and produce severe damage 20 ",

The nature of the NP-biomembrane interactions and their potential 77 toxicity do not only depend on the composition of the NPs, but are also determined by 78 numerous physicochemical properties of NPs. The size and shape of NPs play a significant 79 role in the interaction mechanism of nanomaterials with biological membranes. Zhang et al 80 showed that 18 nm SiO2 NPs cause permanent holes in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) 81 and a decrease in lipid lateral diffusion, whereas SiO2 NPs larger than 78 nm are wrapped 82 by the membrane and lead to an increase in membrane fluidity 22 . Chithrani et al observed 83 higher cellular uptake of spherical gold NPs (AuNPs) into HeLa cells than rod-shaped 84 AuNPs 23 . Additionally, NP-biomembrane interactions are highly dependent on surface 85 modifications and the charge of NPs. Moghadam et al modified the surface coating and 86 charge of AuNPs and titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs and observed that AuNPs and TiO2 NPs 87 with positive charge significantly increase the permeability of DOPC membranes while the 88 dye leakage caused by negatively charged NPs is insignificant 24 . A similar behaviour has 89 been recently reported by Montis et al who showed that cationic AuNPs induce more drastic 90 effects on zwitterionic and negatively charged membranes than anionic and PEG-coated 91 AuNPs 25 .

The solution became bright yellow immediately indication the 145 formation of the Ag seeds. Immediately after the synthesis of Ag seeds and in the same 146 vessel, the as-synthetized silver seeds were grown by cooling down the solution to 90\u00b0C. 147 First, the seed solution was diluted by extracting 20 mL of sample and adding 17 mL of Milli-148 Q-water. Then 500 \u03bcL of SC [25 mM], 1.5 mL of 2.5 mM TA and 1 mL of 25 mM AgNO3 were 149 sequentially injected. This process was repeated up to 2 times, progressively growing the 150 size of the AgNPs until reaching the size ~20 nm (\u223c1.8\u00d710 12 NPs/mL). The obtained AgNPs 151 were purified by centrifugation and stored in a solution containing both TA and SC. 152 UV-Vis Spectroscopy 153 UV-visible spectra were acquired with a Shimadzu UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer. 154 A 10% (v/v) of AgNP solution was placed in a cell and the spectral analysis was performed 155 in the 300-800 nm wavelength range at room temperature. helium-neon laser. 50 \u00b5M AgNPs were suspended in milli-Q water, HEPES saline 168 and HEPES glucose buffer and, after 30 minutes of incubation, each sample was measured 169 three times at a fixed 173\u00b0 back-scattering angle for the hydrodynamic diameter and 17\u00b0 170 scatter angle for \u03b6 potential. The results were processed using the Malvern Zetasizer 171 software to obtain the hydrodynamic diameter from the analysis of the autocorrelation 172 function of the light intensity scattered by the AgNPs, and the \u03b6 potential from the measured 173 electrophoretic mobility using the Smoluchowski approximation. The comparison of the 174 hydrodynamic diameter of AgNPs suspended in the different media was used to evaluate 175 their colloidal stability. 176 Preparation of Large Unilamellar Vesicles (LUVs) 177 Carboxyfluorescein-loaded large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared by the 178 extrusion method. Initially, a 25 mg mL -1 solution of DOPC in chloroform was dried under 179 high vacuum overnight to get a dry lipid thin film.

Next, to break the multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) and 182 form unilamellar liposomes, the sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed in water bath 183 at 60\u00b0C and vortexed. This freeze-thaw-vortex cycle was carried out 10 times. The sample 184 was subsequently extruded 11 times by passing through a 400 nm pore size polycarbonate 185 membrane (Whatman International Ltd., Maidstone, UK) using an Avanti mini-extruder 186 (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.) to obtain a homogeneous population of 400 nm LUVs.

The osmolality of the buffer was measured using a 3320 single-sample micro-219 osmometer (Advanced Instruments, Norwood, UK). The GUVs observed in this study were 220 between 5 \uf06dm and 40 \uf06dm (diameter). The GUV-based experiments were conducted at room 221 temperature on a Zeiss LSM 880 inverted laser scanning confocal microscope. The samples 222 were deposited on the microscope slides previously treated with a 10% BSA solution to 223 prevent GUVs from adhering and rupturing onto the glass. 224 Determination of changes in morphology and membrane permeability of GUVs 225 Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to monitor changes in the 226 permeability and the morphology of GUVs induced by AgNPs. Initially, a membrane-227 impermeable fluorescent dye (10 kDa dextran cascade blue or CF 576 Da) was added to 228 200 \uf06dL of GUVs suspension, consequently the bulk solution becomes fluorescent whereas 229 the lumen of the GUVs remains uncoloured.

The size distribution by number (top graph) shows a monodisperse distribution of AgNPs with peaks around 25 nm, however the size distribution by intensity (bottom graph) displays similar hydrodynamic diameters of AgNPs dispersed in mili-Q water (40.25 \u00b1 1.02 nm) and HEPES glucose buffer (43.55 \u00b1 0.86 nm), whereas in HEPES saline buffer AgNPs show a tendency to form aggregates (199.40 \u00b1 21.45 nm). c) The \u03b6-potential of AgNPs dispersed in mili-Q water and HEPES glucose was also similar while in HEPES saline buffer the surface charge of AgNPs becomes less negative. The colloidal stability and \u03b6-potential of AgNPs in physiological and low ionic strength 282 buffers was tested using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and electrophoretic light scattering 283 (DELSA). The aggregation of NPs can be easily detected by comparing the hydrodynamic 284 size of AgNPs suspended in milli-Q water with their hydrodynamic size when suspended in 285 the buffer of interest. The size distribution by intensity shows that the hydrodynamic diameter 286 of AgNPs in HEPES glucose buffer (43.55 \u00b1 0.86 nm) does not differs significantly from the 287 results in milli-Q water (40.25 \u00b1 1.02 nm), hence the NPs are stable in this buffer (. The larger size obtained by DLS compared to TEM is expected because while TEM 289 measures only the physical size of the core NPs, DLS measures the hydrodynamic size 290 which in addition to the NP core, takes into account the stabiliser coating and the electrical 291 double layer around the NPs 41,42 . On the contrary, these AgNPs show a tendency to form 292 aggregates (199.40 \u00b1 21.45 nm) when the ionic strength of the medium is high 293 (physiological), however the size distribution by number indicates that at this concentration 294 (50 \u00b5M) and incubation time (30 min) most of the AgNPs are still monodisperse (Figure 1b). 295 Similarly, the \u03b6-potential of AgNPs is comparable in milli-Q water and HEPES glucose buffer, 296 -28.0 \u00b1 5.99 mV and -21.2 \u00b1 1.29 mV respectively, whereas in HEPES saline buffer the 297 surface charge of AgNPs becomes less negative (-8.99 \u00b1 1.51 mV) (Figure 1c). The 298 aggregation tendency and the less negative surface charge of AgNPs in physiological ionic 299 strength conditions are closely related. The negative surface charge provided by the citrate 300 coating stabilises the AgNPs suspension by electrostatic repulsions, however in HEPES 301 saline buffer the high concentration of ions produces a screening of the surface charge that 302 compresses the electrical double layer around the AgNPs 43-45 . ionic strength of the medium modulates the effect of AgNPs on the membrane 306 permeability 307 The effect of AgNPs on the membrane permeability was initially investigated by 308 quantifying the release of 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein from DOPC LUVs. The 309 carboxyfluorescein (CF) loaded DOPC LUVs (400 nm diameter) were suspended in isotonic 310 HEPES saline buffer or HEPES glucose buffer reaching a final phospholipid concentration 311 of 0.10 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b5M. The LUV suspensions were then exposed to various concentrations of 312 AgNPs (1 \u00b5M, 3 \u00b5M, 10 \u00b5M, 30 \u00b5M and 100 \u00b5M) and the fluorescence emission of were performed comparing the fluorescence emission of samples at 317 various concentrations of CF and the same samples plus 100 \u03bcM AgNPs to ensure that the 318 NPs are not interfering with the fluorescence signal of CF (Figure S2). In HEPES saline 319 buffer, the exposure of LUVs to 10 \u03bcM AgNPs produce a notable dye leakage, but at higher 320 AgNPs concentrations dye release from the LUVs begin to be more extensive, reaching a 321 maximum leakage of nearly 15% and 30% after 30 minutes of incubation with 30 \u03bcM and 322 100 \u03bcM AgNPs, respectively. At that moment, the dye release reaches a plateau and 323 remains stable for the next 60 minutes. In HEPES glucose buffer, after 30 minutes incubation 324 at the highest concentrations of AgNPs (30 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcM), the LUVs produce just a 325 marginal dye release, which does not vary until 90 minutes of exposure when it increases 326 slightly but does not exceed 10% CF release. Since aggregation is known to be 327 concentration and time dependent, at lower concentrations the NPs are less aggregated. 328 However, at the same incubation times, the highest concentrations of NPs lead to more and 329 larger aggregates, but still in suspension, which would be able to interact with the vesicles 330 and perturb their membrane due to their reduced solubility. At longer times, the aggregates 331 would be expected to grow further until they reach a size where they are no longer colloidal, 332 drop out of suspension and sediment to the bottom of the sample. In this way they could 333 become excluded from the solution and no longer able to interact with the vesicles. These 334 results indicate that the conditions of the surrounding environment have",

Insets show a schematic representation of CF leakage from LUVs as well as the proportion of dye leakage as a function of NP concentration after 90 minutes of incubation in both buffers. b) DOPC GUVs labelled with Rh-DOPE with different degrees of permeability to 10 kDa dextran labelled with cascade blue fluorophore: unleaked GUV (1), partially leaked GUVs (2 and 3) and fully leaked GUV (4). c) The proportion of DOPC GUVs permeable to 10 kDa dextran increases with the concentration of AgNPs in physiological ionic strength medium. Osmotic shock controls were performed to ensure that this effect was not induced by changes in the osmolarity of the medium. In HEPES glucose buffer, the highest concentration of AgNPs does not induce a noticeable change in the number of GUVs permeable to dextran. The statistical significance was tested using a one way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparisons test (*p \u2264 0.05, **p \u2264 0.01). d) Comparison between influx of CF and 10 kDa dextran into DOPC GUVs after exposure to 100 \u00b5M AgNPs. A higher proportion of GUVs become permeable to CF than to dextran. The distribution of permeable GUVs according to their level of leakage show a higher influx rate of CF than of dextran. Inset: schematic view of different levels of dye leakage. The release of the dye encapsulated in the vesicles can be a consequence of 338 different processes, from complete lysis of liposomes to the formation of nanosized pores in 339 the membrane. To identify the mechanism behind the change in membrane permeability, control experiments were carried out adding equivalent volumes of milli-Q water 344 to the GUVs to test the effect of a potential osmotic shock and ensure that the effects 345 observed are indeed produced by the AgNPs. At physiological ionic strength, the exposure 346 to AgNPs induces a dose-dependent increase in GUVs permeable to 10 kDa dextran, which 347 is statistically significant at the three concentrations of AgNPs tested (Figure 2c). This effect 348 is not observed in low ionic strength (HEPES glucose buffer) conditions where the exposure 349 of the GUVs to AgNPs barely produces any change in their permeability to dextran 10 kDa. 350 Thus, these observations demonstrate a regulating role of the medium composition on the 351 AgNPs-membrane interactions. 352 The influx of large macromolecules, such as 10 kDa dextran, into the lumen of GUVs 353 must be induced by the formation of pores in the membrane, which can vary in size and 354 lifetime 46-48 . Confocal microscopy enables the analysis of the behaviour of individual GUVs 355 in the sample, allowing us to quantify the specific degree of leakage in each individual vesicle 356 observed (Figure 2b). Figure 2d compares the proportion of GUVs permeable to CF (0.37 357 kDa) and 10 kDa dextran after exposure to 100 \u03bcM of AgNPs as well as the distribution 358 according to their degree of leakage. The proportion of GUVs permeable to CF molecules 359 is nearly three times higher than to macromolecules of dextran. The distribution of 360 permeable GUVs as a function of the normalised fluorescence intensity in their lumen show 361 that nearly 40% of the permeable GUVs were fully filled (> 80% dye leakage) with CF after 362 exposure to 100 \u03bcM AgNPs whereas less than the 20% of GUVs permeable to 10 kDa 363 dextran showed more than 60% of leakage, of which just a marginal proportion were fully 364 leaked. According to these results, the AgNPs produce nanoscale pores in heal, recovering its integrity and blocking further transmembrane diffusion. 369 AgNPs can induce the formation of intraluminal vesicles in physiological ionic 370 strength conditions 371 The exposure to AgNPs produces membrane intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) in a small 372 proportion of the GUVs when suspended in physiological ionic strength buffer. These ILVs 373 are small vesicles filled with extravesicular bulk medium (10 kDa dextran labelled with 374 cascade blue fluorophore) within the lumen of the GUVs. The formation of the ILVs is very 375 fast, however some images show potential intermediate states consisting of pearling tubes 376 (Figure 3). This phenomenon has been previously reported by Yu and Granick, who 377 observed that aliphatic amine NPs encapsulated within DOPC GUVs adsorb onto the inner 378 lipid leaflet of the membrane and induce an initial protrusion of large tubes followed by 379 pearling events 49 . Montis et al. also observed that the exposure of POPC GUVs to cationic 380 gold nanorods (AuNR) produce tubular lipid protrusions that breakup into pearls 25 . The 381 experimental procedure and data analysis used for these experiments was the same 382 employed for the estimation of dye leakage into GUVs. The proportion of GUVs with ILVs is 383low but statistically significant with respect to GUVs before exposure to AgNPs and the 384 osmotic shock controls. Notably, ILVs formation does not vary significantly with the 385 concentration of AgNPs, presenting in all cases between the 5% and 6% of GUVs observedFigure 3). This effect was not seen in low ionic strength buffer, hence it is also influenced 387 by the composition of the medium.",

Notably, this decrease in membrane fluidity occurs universally 418 across all GUVs in the sample as the histograms are almost fully displaced from one another 419 in the physiological buffer, unlike the low probability effects of poration and ILV or very transient adsorption of AgNPs onto the membrane under these 424 conditions. Interestingly, the average diffusion coefficient of DOPC GUVs in these conditions 425 (2.54 \u00b1 0.31 \u00b5m 2 s -1 ) is lower than in high ionic strength buffer. These data suggest that the 426 ionic strength of the medium could not be the only environmental condition modulating the 427 interaction mechanism between the AgNPs and the membrane, but also the presence of 428 high concentrations of sugars might be protecting the membrane. Previous studies have 429 reported that sugars decrease the lipid lateral diffusion in a concentration-dependent 430 manner using Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) 55 .

D values indicate the mean diffusion coefficient calculated in each condition. In HEPES saline buffer, AgNPs induce a slight but decrease in lipid lateral diffusion. In low ionic strength medium the membrane fluidity of DOPC GUVs is lower than in HEPES saline and does not change after incubation with AgNPs. Insets show examples of FRAP recovery curves obtained in each condition. 434 AgNPs considerably affect the mechanical properties of a sub-population of GUVs in 435 physiological ionic strength buffer 436 The ability of AgNPs to produce membrane invaginations suggest that these NPs 437 might modify the mechanical properties of the membrane. Flicker spectroscopy experiments 438 were performed to quantify the distribution of membrane tension (\u03c3) and bending modulus 439 (\u03bab) of GUV membranes. This technique has a limitation in spatiotemporal resolution which 440 does not allow us to calculate accurately the amplitude of membrane fluctuations (\u2329|u(q)| 2 \u232a) 441 of high-tension GUVs within a broad enough range of wavenumbers (q) 56 . This issue was 442 circumvented by the osmotic relaxation of GUVs which decreases the tension of the 443 membrane, increasing the amplitude of the membrane's thermal undulations and therefore 444 making the fitting of the power spectrum more reliable. Additionally, the osmotic pressure of 445 the AgNPs suspension was balanced with sucrose until isotonic to the experimental medium 446 to prevent changes in the osmolarity of the medium during the experiment. 447 As expected, in low ionic strength glucose buffer AgNPs do not induce any significant 448 change in either the tension or the bending rigidity of the membrane. In high ionic strength 449 (physiological) conditions, the addition of 100 \u03bcM AgNPs to the osmotically relaxed GUVs 450 induces subtle changes in the mechanical properties of the membrane. The distribution of 451 both the tension and the bending rigidity values become wider after the incubation of GUVs 452 with AgNPs. We observe a rise in the mean membrane tension, which despite not seeming 453 to be a drastic change, is statistically significant (p < 0.01) (Figure 5a). This increase in 454 membrane tension is accompanied by a small decrease in membrane rigidity, of the GUVs analysed (Figure 5c). These results could be directly related to the 459 formation of membrane pores, invaginations and ILVs, described early, which also only 460 occur in a small sub-population of the GUVs. A recent study has shown that formation of 461 ILVs by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) produces a 462 significant increase in the membrane tension of GUVs originated by the removal of excess 463 membrane surface area 57 . Furthermore, the increase of the membrane tension is known to 464 favour the membrane poration 58-60 , and therefore could favour the membrane AgNPs in physiological ionic conditions significantly impact the membrane mechanical properties of a sub-population of GUVs. Effect of AgNPs on the mechanical properties of osmotically relaxed DOPC GUVs. a) In HEPES saline, 100 \u00b5M AgNPs induce a broader distribution and a slight shift in bending rigidity (\u03ba b / k B T) which is not statistically significant. In low ionic strength buffer the bending rigidity barely changes. b) In HEPES glucose buffer the membrane tension (\u03c3) does not vary after exposure of GUVs to 100 \u00b5M AgNPs whereas is HEPES saline a significant change in membrane tension is observed (**p \u2264 0.01, ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparisons test). c) The plot of bending rigidity against membrane tension show that the majority of GUVs in all conditions have similar membrane tension (>5x10 -7 Nm -1 ) and bending rigidity (15 -",

            "text": "469 physicochemical properties, nonetheless these properties are susceptible to change once 470 the NPs enter biological media. The results presented in this work firstly evidence a 471 significant impact of the medium conditions on the surface charge and colloidal stability of 472 AgNPs. The citrate coating of AgNPs gives them a negative surface charge and stabilises 473 the colloidal suspension in low ionic strength media through electrostatic double-layer 474 repulsions. However, the high concentration of ions in physiological conditions modifies the 475 \u03b6-potential of AgNPs and promotes their aggregation making the NPs less negatively 476 charged. In this medium, Na + ions screen the negative surface charge and decreases the 477 inter-particle repulsive force, thereby facilitating the concentration dependent aggregation investigations have focused on the effect of the attachment of 480 proteins to the NP surface (protein corona) on the biological activities of NPs 50,63-68 , however 481 comparatively less attention has been paid to other properties of the medium, such as pH 482 or ionic strength, which can also alter the physicochemical properties of NPs and their 483 biointeractions. Our data show that in high (physiological) ionic strength conditions, AgNPs 484 induce subtle but important effects on the physicochemical properties of the membrane, 485 whereas in low ionic strength buffer the membrane maintains its integrity after exposure to 486 AgNPs. Therefore, the buffer conditions modify the interactions of AgNPs acting at attractive forces, preventing significant interaction. However, when the ionic 491 strength increases, the screening of surface charge of AgNPs decrease electrostatic 492 repulsive forces between the NPs and the membrane, increasing the likelihood of more 493 significant interaction. In addition, the loss of colloidal stability and weak aggregation 494 behaviour of AgNPs makes them less soluble and more surface active, further increasing 495 membrane interactions. This modulatory effect of the ionic strength of the medium on the 496 AgNPs-membrane interaction has been reported earlier by Wang et al, who, using quartz 497 crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D), found that the deposition rates of AgNPs on 498 DOPC supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) increases when the concentration of salt in the 499 medium rises 70 . A similar electrostatically-mediated interaction was reported by Li and 500 Malmstadt for cationic polystyrene NPs (PNPs) which interact weakly with the membrane as 501 the ionic strength of the medium increases 46 . 502 In physiological conditions, we observe that AgNPs induce changes in membrane 503 permeability and can form membrane invaginations such as ILVs. Several studies have 504 shown the ability of eukaryotic, bacterial and virus proteins as well as antibacterial peptides 505 and NPs to change the morphology of the membrane and form invaginations and ILVs 506 without the need of cellular endocytic mechanisms or external sources of energy 25,49,57,71-74 .507Generally the interaction of single proteins or particles is not strong enough to induce these 508 large deformations of the membrane and thus many molecules or particles must cooperate 509 to bend the membrane51,72 . For instance, the clustering of Gb3-binding B subunit of the 510 bacterial Shiga toxin (STxB) can induce membrane invagination in artificial model 511 membranes, however these invaginations are not observed when the clustering is",

            "text": "519 membrane translocation of impermeable dextran probes and the relaxation of the membrane 520 tension. The lifetime of membrane pores is usually short because as the membrane tension 521 relaxes, the line tension at the pore edge drives closure of the pore 58,75 . The size of the pore 522 defines the minimum size of the molecules that can diffuse across the membrane. The 523 higher permeability to carboxyfluorescein (0.37 kDa) than to dextran (10 kDa) observed in 524 our experiments represents the presence of nanoscale pores in the membrane as a result 525 of the AgNPs. Furthermore, the fact that most of the GUVs observed were not fully leaked 526 indicates these pores are transient. 527 In general, toxicology studies focus on terminal effects where the analytes induce 528 severe damages in the membrane or other cellular components that lead to cell death. 529 However, other subtle effects in the physicochemical properties of the membrane can also 530 have biological importance. Cells are able to sense mechanical stimuli and convert them 531 into intracellular biochemical signals to adapt to their microenvironment 76 . Mechanical 532 forces can modify the mechanical and dynamical properties of the membrane, which in turn 533 can induce conformational changes in membrane proteins, such as ion channels 77 , G-534 protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) 78-80 and integrins 81 . These proteins trigger metabolic 535 cascades that lead to different cellular responses such as cell migration, differentiation, and 536 proliferation 82,83 . In endothelial cells for instance, the plasma membrane organ growth by regulating cell proliferation 85 . The mechanical stress applied 541 to the plasma membrane modulates the actin cytoskeleton and activate GPCRs. This begins 542 a complex signal pathway that eventually activates the proto-oncogenes proteins YAP/TAZ 543 which translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and induce cell proliferation 86 . 544 Prolonged mechanical stress can lead to an overexpression of YAP/TAZ promoting 545 unregulated cell proliferation and eventually oncogenesis 85,86 . Therefore, even small 546 changes in the mechanical and dynamical properties of the membrane, such as the ones 547 produced by AgNPs, can induce multiple cellular responses which lead to a myriad of 548 processes encompassing from inflammatory responses to the development of are complex and crowded with biomolecules which can interact with 551 the NPs in a non-specific manner and modulate their behaviour. Thereby, the biological 552 interactions of NPs can be influenced by multiple external factors. These factors can be 553 simulated and controlled in vitro, for instance introducing proteins to investigate the 554 formation of protein coronas and their effect in NP-membrane interactions. Another factor 555that would be interesting to study is the impact of excluded volume effects generated by 556 macromolecular crowding on these interactions. This phenomenon is known to promote 557 protein-protein interactions 87 , and the binding of proteins to the membrane 88 , thus it is likely 558 to influence the interaction between NPs and the membrane.",
