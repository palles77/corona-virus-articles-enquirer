A bovine TGEV-specific polyclonal antibody was purified by affinity chromatography with the TRIO Bioprocessing System and was used as the capture antibody, at a concentration of 1.5 txg/well. The F5.39 monoclonal antibody was obtained by the fusion of spleen lymphocytes from TGEV immunized mice with NS-I myeloma cells. This mAb was used as a second antibody for the ELISA. The ELISA detected 40 ng of TGEV and 407 ng of PRCV. To study the ability of ELISA to detect TGEV in field cases, 53 intestinal samples were taken from pigs exhibiting clinical signs of transmissible gastroenteritis. All the positive samples detected by the ELISA were confirmed as positive by immunofluorescence or cell culture immunofluorescence. To study the ability of this ELISA to detect PRCV in nasal swabs and lung samples, 20 seven-day-old piglets were inoculated with a Quebec strain of PRCV. The ELISA was able to detect PRCV in both kinds of samples.",

TGE is characterized by vomiting, a profuse watery diarrhea, and a high mortality rate (often 100%) in piglets under 2 weeks of age, and manifests itself as transitory enteritis in adult pigs (Saif and Heckert, 1990; Moxley et al., 1993) .

            "text": "The diagnosis of TGE may be accomplished by viral detection or rising titers of antibody in serum. The latter method takes two weeks because of the interval required between the two samples. The most widely used technique to detect TGEV is probably immunofluorescent (IF) staining of small intestinal sections or smears from infected pigs (Pensaert et ai., 1970) , but its use is limited to dead pigs. Problems which may be encountered in IF tests include a lack of sensitivity or specificity of antibody reagents and loss of infected epithelial cells in pigs killed at a later stage of infection (Saif and Heckert, 1990) . Other methods frequently used to detect TGEV include cell culture immunofluorescence (CCIF) (Bohl, 1979) , and negative contrast or immune electron microscopy. The first method is cumbersome for use in routine diagnosis, especially because wild strains of TGEV are difficult to cultivate in cell cultures; the second one is expensive and time-consuming. Other less commonly used procedures include: agar gel precipitation (Bohac et al., 1975) , immunoelectrophoresis and counterimmunoelectrophoresis ( Bohac and Derbyshire, 1975) , indirect hemagglutination (Skalinskii et al., 1977) and immunoperoxidase staining of infected tissues (Becker et al., 1974; Chu et al., 1982) . The ELISA has been demonstrated to be useful for detecting TGEV from feces (Bernard et al., 1986; van Nieuwstadt et al., 1988) . However, according to our knowledge, its use to detect PRCV from nasal swabs and lungs has never been described.",

The results obtained by ELISA, IF and CCIF test in a total of 353 nasal swabs, lung, feces and intestine samples correlated well with each other. Consequently, the ELISA appeared to be sensitive and specific for the detection of PRCV or TGEV. The detection of PRCV in samples from experimentally infected piglets showed that nasal swabs or any piece from the lungs can be used to detect PRCV by the ELISA. Finally, the l Q90 was confirmed to be a pathogenic strain of PRCV since mortality and lung lesions were observed in the experimentally infected piglets.",
