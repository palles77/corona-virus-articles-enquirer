Methods: Outpatient records for acute upper respiratory infections (ICD9 CM codes: 460, 462, 463,464, 465.9 and 487) in a randomly selected sample (n \u00bc 39,766 children in 2005) was used to estimate the cumulative relative risks (RR) associated with average temperature lasting for 8 days (lag 0-7 days), air pollutants (NO 2 , O 3 and PM 2.5 ) lasting for 6 days (lag 0-5 days), and virus-specific positive isolation rate lasting for 11 days (lag 0-10 days) using distributed lag non-linear models after controlling for relative humidity, wind speed, day of week, holiday effects and long-term trend. Results: Average temperature of 33 1C was associated with the lowest risk for outpatient visits of acute upper respiratory infections. Relative to 33 1C, cumulative 8-day RR was highest at 15 1C of ambient average temperature [RR \u00bc1.94; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.78, 2.11]. With the first quartile as reference, cumulative 6-day RRs were 1.25 (95% CI: 1.21, 1.29) for NO 2 , 1.04 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.06) for O 3 , and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.03) for PM 2.5 at the 95th percentile. Per-standard deviation (SD) increase of virus-specific isolation rate for influenza type A (SD \u00bc13.2%), type B (SD \u00bc 8.76%), and adenoviruses (SD \u00bc5.25%) revealed statistical significance for overall 11-day RRs of 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.03), 1.05 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.06) and 1.04 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.05), respectively. Conclusions: Current study suggested a positive association between outpatient visits for acute upper respiratory infections and ambient environment factors, including average temperature, air pollutants, and circulating respiratory viruses.",

Moreover, air pollutants, including NO 2 , O 3 , and particulate matter (PM), were also reported correlated with increased morbidity of respiratory infections (Burnett et al., 2001; Hwang and Chan, 2002; Lin et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2008; Peel et al., 2005; Schwartz et al., 1991; Wong et al., 2009; Wong et al., 2006) . Even though the evidence of positive association between ambient environment and elevation of acute upper respiratory infections were revealed in literature, respiratory infections were believed to be more linked to the circulation of respiratory biological agents (Denny, 1995; Simoes et al., 2006; Treanor and Lee, 2010) . Although some evidence about risk estimates of environmental risk factors showed various day lags resulting from displacement effect (harvesting effect) (Zanobetti et al., 2000) , the association and interaction between acute upper respiratory infections and environmental and biological factors remains unclear. Moreover, latencies (the lag effects) of circulating respiratory viruses, air pollutants, and temperature led to more difficulties in clarifying the associations.",

Additionally, transmission of suspected infectious bioaerosol (e.g., influenza viruses) has been reported negatively related with ambient temperature (Lowen et al., 2007) . The present study detected significant correlations between average temperature and daily isolations for influenza A (correlations coefficient\u00bc \u00c00.15, po0.01), influenza B (correlations coefficient\u00bc \u00c00.22, p o0.01), and adenoviruses (correlations coefficient\u00bc0.05, p o0.05).

A possible explanation is that people who have mild illness may prefer to stay in indoor environment and take actions in response to remit the symptoms themselves, rather than to seek medical help outside in cold temperature. Experimental studies demonstrated that exposure to air pollutants synergistically caused viral or bacterial infections in airway epithelial cells (Chauhan and Johnston, 2003; Ciencewicki and Jaspers, 2007; Ciencewicki et al., 2008) . Exposure to ozone may enhance sensitivity of inflammation (Ciencewicki et al., 2008) and thus increased the possibility of infections (Ciencewicki and Jaspers, 2007; Spannhake et al., 2002) . But, ozone can also be protective because of its virucidal effect that relies on the exposure timing (before or after the respiratory infections) and duration (Ciencewicki and Jaspers, 2007) . No matter the NO 2 exposure is preceding or succeeding to respiratory viral infections, NO 2 may decrease virus-specific immunity in mice and increase the inflammation of cells (Ciencewicki and Jaspers, 2007) . The exposure of PM was suggested to decrease phagocytic ability and evoke infection in animal models, but the phenomenon was found specifically for respiratory syncytial virus only (Becker and Soukup, 1999; Kaan and Hegele, 2003; Lambert et al., 2003a; Lambert et al., 2003b) .",

Jaakkola et al.

NO 2 and PM 10 were also found strongly correlated with respiratory infections for children in Toronto . In Hong Kong, general practitioner visits for acute upper respiratory infections were reported associated with ambient NO 2 , O 3 , PM 10 and PM 2.5 . Similar to our finding, Wong et al. (2006) also identified NO 2 with the greatest effects following by O 3 on acute upper respiratory infections . However, we identified the positive association between PM 2.5 and acute upper respiratory infections when its concentration exceeded 70 mg/m 3 in Taipei metropolitan. Numerous studies reported a positive association between PM and mortality/morbidity of cardiopulmonary diseases (Wilson et al., 2004) . Relatively few studies evaluated both the effects of ambient environment and circulating respiratory viruses on acute respiratory infections. Wong et al. (2009) that ambient influenza activity should be involved in the consideration of short-term effects of air pollutants. Therefore, more studies focusing on related issues are warranted in the future. This study evaluated the risk pattern of PM 10 , PM 2.5 , daily hourly maximum O 3 , maximum 8-h moving average for O 3 , and daily 24-h average O 3 relating to outpatient visits of acute upper respiratory infections. Based on model selection strategy of lower AIC value and relative risks estimated, the optimal model on prediction of acute upper respiratory infections was the one using 24-h average of PM 2.5 and O 3 . Similar findings were reported in two previous papers (Schwartz and Neas, 2000; Wong et al., 2006) , concluding that the magnitude of RR was higher for PM 2.5 than PM 10 , in contrast to the study in Toronto .",

(2008) indicated that ozone level was correlated with 2-day lag of hospital admission for respiratory diseases in childhood. Fusco et al. (2001) found acute respiratory infections significantly associated with the levels of NO 2 at lag 0 day , which was consistent to our observations. We have tried to evaluate the lag effects for virus-specific isolation rate on outpatient visits of acute upper respiratory infections. This study found influenza B and adenoviruses associated with acute upper respiratory infections at lag 0-3 days and lag 7-10 days, and lag effects were significant from lag 2-8 days for influenza A. In this study, we observed clear lag effects varying with covariates and their levels throughout evaluating periods (Figs. 4-6) . Therefore, using DLNM to calculate the cumulative relative risks of outpatient visits for acute upper respiratory infections to risk factors on a given day and lag days would be a more sensible method.",

Therefore, the effect of other respiratory viruses, including rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, bocavirus, polyomavirus, and bacterial infections which have been reported in recent studies (Brodzinski and Ruddy, 2009; Dasaraju and Liu, 1996; Denny, 1995; Mackie, 2003; Treanor and Lee, 2010; Wang et al., 2006) was out of the scope of present study. In addition, the influence from government-funded seasonal influenza vaccination campaign starting in 1999 in Taiwan was not evaluated in the present study, because Taiwan CDC did not establish a complete database for advanced evaluation. Moreover, current study utilized data of a cohort with one million subjects which was started in 2000 that implied the lack of information for children aged younger than 2 years during the study periods ",
