For some viruses, a viral protein has been identified as an apoptosis-inducing factor [23, 25] . Alternatively, genes of many DNA viruses have evolved to encode proteins which suppress or delay apoptosis, thus facilitating the production of large amounts of progeny virus. For example, the poxvirus crmA gene product and baculovirus p35 prevent induction of apoptosis through the inhibition of cell death central effector machinery [5, 26] . Also, over-expression of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 prevents either the Sindbis virus-or Semliki Forest virus-induced apoptosis, leading to the establishment of a persistent infection with increased virus production [13, 14, 22] . The role of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of coronavirus infections is not completely understood, although many data, obtained for both animal and human coronaviruses, indicate that apoptosis is associated with virus replication [1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 19] .",

Yan et al. [27] have shown that the CPE induced by SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells is mainly dependent on the activation of apoptosis. Recently, the viral accessory protein 7a has been found to be able to induce apoptosis via caspasedependent pathway [24] . However, it is still not clear whether apoptosis is required for release of virions by infected cells, and whether preventing apoptotic cell death could modify the efficiency and/or kinetics of virus replication.",

The control vector pEFneo was used to establish a control cell line. Expression of the transfected gene was stable after passaging these cells several times. Before study initiation, cells were grown for three weeks in the presence of G418, and Bcl-2 expression was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis.",

The proportion of hypodiploid cells was lower in Bcl-2-expressing cells, remaining in the range of uninfected cells throughout entire observation period (Fig. 2a) . The reduction was highly significant at 72 h.p.i. (34.4% of hypodiploid cells in neo-Vero cells vs 8.7% in bcl-2-Vero cells; p = 0.008). Consistently, the frequency of TUNEL-positive cells was reduced to background levels in bcl-2-Vero cells (25% in neo-Vero cells vs 9% in bcl-2-Vero cells at 48 h.p.i.) (Fig. 2b) . The exposure of SARS-CoV infected cells to Z-VAD-FMK completely prevented apoptosis (not shown). Cleavage products of both PARP, a well known caspase-3 substrate, and procaspase-8, were detected in SARS-CoV infected neo-Vero cells, and were partially prevented in bcl-2-Vero cells at 72 h.p.i. (Fig. 2c) . These findings support the hypothesis that apoptosis is triggered by a caspase-dependent mechanism in our system. Figure 3 shows the time course of infectious virus progeny production, either released in the supernatant or remaining cell-associated, in neo-and bcl-2-Vero cells cultures. During the logarithmic phase of viral replication (with a peak at 16 h.p.i. that was sustained to 24 h.p.i.), cell-associated infectivity was higher than that released in the supernatants in both culture systems. At 48 h.p.i., the proportion of cell-associated and released virus was similar, and at 72 h.p.i., the proportion was reversed. Interestingly, the time course and the extent of viral progeny production, as well as the proportion of cell-associated vs shed virus, was super-imposable for bcl-2-and neo-Vero cell cultures (Fig. 3) , as well as in neo-Vero cells exposed to Z-VAD-FMK (not shown). RNA accumulation in cell pellets and shed in supernatants was parallel to that of viral infectivity (not shown), and did not significantly differ in bcl-2-and neo-Vero cell cultures.",

However, apoptosis appears to be a late phenomenon compared with completion of the virus replication cycle.
