            "text": "Viruses as obligate intracellular parasites require their host to replicate them and to facilitate their spread to others. In humans, viral infections are rarely lethal, even if they are highly cytolytic to individual cells. Mortality commonly occurs when viruses jump species (such as Ebola or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV )), when the virus undergoes a major antigenic change (i.e., influenza viruses), or when host immunity is compromised. HIV represents one of the most dramatic human examples of an exotic virus that kills its host. However, HIV kills slowly, providing ample time to spread to new hosts and an effective strategy for persistence in the species. Death or dire consequences following virus infection in mammals with inadequate immunity are well illustrated by observations that fetuses or neonates, especially if deprived of passive immunity, succumb to many agents well tolerated by normal adults. The increasing wealth of immunological tools, such as transgenic animal models and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) tetramers, have provided sensitive methods for defining the relevance of immune mechanisms for antiviral defense. In most situations, defense against viruses involves multiple immune components, and the impact of a single mechanism varies greatly according to the method by which individual viruses enter, replicate, and spread within the host. In this chapter, we highlight the principal means by which the host achieves immunity following infection by viruses. n ViRal ENTRy aNd iNfEcTioN n Access to target tissues presents numerous obstacles for entry and infection by most human viruses. Most effective of these are the mechanical barriers provided by the skin and mucosal surfaces, as well as the chemically hostile environment of the gut (Fig. 27.1) . A number of common human viral pathogens enter through the gastrointestinal tract, including rotavirus, enteric adenoviruses, and hepatitis A virus (HAV ). These are usually spread via person-toperson contact or contaminated food and water. Respiratory infections caused by influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, measles virus, varicella-zoster virus (VZV ), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV ) are often spread by aerosol transmission, as well as person-to-person contact. Many of the herpes viruses target the skin or the mucosae, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV ) and VZV. HSV in particular can infect oral and genital mucosa, the eye, and the skin through small cuts and abrasions. Other herpes viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV ) and cytomegalovirus (CMV ), target the mucosa. CMV can also spread vertically from mother to baby or rarely via blood transfusions. Human papillomavirus (HPV ) targets skin and muscosa and causes warts and may transform cells, inducing cancers such as cervical cancer. Viruses such as West Nile virus and Semliki forest virus may also enter through the skin via insect vectors. HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV ) are commonly spread via sexual contact. HIV, HBV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV ) can also infect humans via direct entry into the bloodstream via transfusions or contaminated needles.",

            "text": "Most human viruses replicate only in certain target tissues, this being mainly the consequence of viral receptor distribution. Many viruses use two receptors, such as the use of the CD4 co-receptor and CCR5 by HIV. After attachment to a cellular receptor, viruses may fuse with the cell membrane or be endocytosed and then gain entry into the cytoplasm or nucleus by fusing with the vesicular membrane (enveloped viruses such as HSV and HIV ), or translocate across the cell membrane or induce lysis of the endocytic vesicle once in the cytoplasm (nonenveloped viruses such as Norwalk virus and poliovirus). 1 Viruses then utilize host cell machinery and specialized virally encoded proteins to replicate rapidly within the cell. Once they have multiplied within the cell, many viruses induce cytolysis in order to facilitate release of new infectious virions (the poxviruses, poliovirus, and herpes viruses, for example). Other viruses are released from infected cells by budding through the cell membrane in the absence of cell death (i.e., HIV and influenza virus). Having entered the body, however, viruses encounter numerous innate defenses and activate the components of adaptive immunity. The latter usually assures that clinical disease, if not infection, will not become evident. Successful exploitation of these defenses through the use of vaccines remains a central challenge for many human viruses, particularly those that cause chronic infections such as HIV and HCV. 2",

            "text": "n iNNaTE iMMuNiTy To ViRuSES n Viral infection induces an extensive array of defense mechanisms in the host. Innate defenses come into play to block or inhibit initial infection, to protect cells from infection, or to eliminate virus-infected cells, and occur well before the onset of adaptive immunity (Chapter 3). The innate immune defenses are initiated via pathogen recognition receptors of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family or a family of DExD/H box RNA helicases (Table 27 .2). 3 These cellular sensors promote the expression of type I (\ufffd/\ufffd) interferons (IFN) and a variety of IFN-stimulated genes and inflammatory cytokines. 4 TLRs are cell surface or endosomal membrane-bound proteins expressed by numerous cells including dendritic cells (DC), macrophages, lymphocytes, and parenchymal cells. 5 Expression of TLRs is largely inducible in most cell types, though some (TLR7/8/9) are constitutively expressed at high levels by specialized plasmacytoid DC for rapid IFN production. Different TLR molecules recognize specific viral products such as single-and double-stranded RNA (TLR 3 and TLR7/8, respectively) or double-stranded DNA (TLR9). The more recently described non-TLR RNA helicases, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene (MDA-5), mediate cytoplasmic recognition of viruses. 6 It is thought that other cytoplasmic sensors of viruses are also likely to exist such as the recently discovered cytosolic dsDNA sensor DAI (DNA-dependent activator of IFN). The innate defense system consists of multiple cellular components and many specialized proteins. The longest-known and best-studied antiviral proteins are the \ufffd/\ufffd IFNs, which act by binding to the type I IFN receptor and result in the transcription of more than 100 IFN-stimulated genes. One consequence of this 'antiviral state' is the inhibition of cell protein synthesis and the prevention of viral replication. Type I IFNs also activate natural killer (NK) cells and induce other cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-12 that promote NK responses. NK cells produce proinflammatory In addition to IFN-\ufffd/\ufffd, several other host proteins function in antiviral defense. These include natural antibody, which may play a role in defense against some virus infections, as well as the complement proteins (Chapter 20). Some viruses may be directly inactivated by complement activation or be destroyed by phagocytic cells that bind and ingest complement-bound virions. Several cytokines and chemokines induced by virus infection also play a role in defense. These include the cytokines TNF-\ufffd, IFN-\ufffd, IL-12, IL-6, and chemokines such as MIP-1\ufffd. In particular, IL-12 is a potent inducer of IFN-\ufffd from NK cells (Chapter 10). Inflammatory chemokines may also play an important role in innate antiviral defense by orchestrating macrophage, neutrophil, DC, and NK responses at the site of infection 9 (Chapter 11). Not only are these components of innate immunity involved in mediating initial protection against viruses, several components (such as the TLRs and type I IFN and IL-12) serve to shape the nature and effectiveness of the subsequent adaptive response to viral antigens. n adapTiVE iMMuNiTy To ViRuSES n Innate immunity generally serves to slow, rather than stop, viral infection, allowing time for the adaptive immune response to begin. The two major divisions of adaptive immunity, antibody and T-cell-mediated, are mainly directed at different targets. Antibodies usually function by binding to free viral particles, and in so doing block infection of the host cell. In contrast, T cells act principally by recognizing and destroying virusinfected cells. As all viruses replicate within cells and many of them spread directly between cells without re-entering the extracellular environment, resolution of infection is reliant more on T-cell function than on antibody. Antiviral antibody, however, does assume considerably more importance as an additional immunoprotective barrier against >> T-cell immunity is more important for control than antibody with many viral infections >> Antibody is important to minimize reinfection, particularly at mucosal sites >> Immune memory is often sufficient to prevent secondary disease, though not in all viral infections reinfection. It is the presence of antibody at portals of entry -most often mucosal surfaces -that is of particular relevance to influenza and HIV infections. Accordingly, vaccinologists try to design vaccines that optimally induce mucosal antibody.",

Occasionally, however, Fc receptor binding of antibody-bound virus may facilitate infection and result in more severe tissue damage.

Specific CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) precursors recognize antigen in the context of MHC class I-peptide antigen complexes on professional APC, such as DC. The CD8 T cells become activated, proliferate, and differentiate into effectors. Expansion of these na\u00efve antigen-specific precursors is considerable, often exceeding 10 000-fold, and results in an effector population that can account for 40% or more of a host's total CD8 T-cell population ( Fig.  27 .2). Various factors, including antigen and APC, co-stimulatory molecules (such as CD28 and 4-1BB) and inflammatory cytokines (such as IFN-\ufffd/\ufffd and IL-12) are required to program the development of functional effector lymphocytes. 16 The CTL effectors enter the efferent lymph and bloodstream and access almost all body locations, including both primary and subsequent sites of infection. However, effectors do not stay activated for long once the virus is cleared, and approximately 95% die by a process termed activation-induced cell death. Following this contraction phase, the remaining cells differentiate into memory cells, which remain as a more or less stable population in the host for many years. They represent an expanded pool of CTL precursors that can be activated upon secondary encounter with antigen, and provide enhanced protection upon reinfection with the same virus. The topic of memory and homeostasis as it relates to antiviral immunity is further discussed later in this chapter.",

Th2 T cells play a protective function against some parasite infections (Chapter 29), though in some virus infections an exuberant Th2 response may be associated with immunopathology or impaired immunity. Indeed, blocking the Th2 cytokine IL-10 was recently shown to assist in the clearance of chronic viral infection. Additionally, an IL-17-producing subset of effector CD4 T cells has also been described (Th17), with potential roles in immune pathogenesis. 23 n iMMuNological MEMoRy n Immunological memory is a cardinal feature of adaptive immunity. The goal of vaccinology is to induce long-lived immunological memory to protect against reinfection. Following infection with certain viruses, memory can be exceptionally long-lived, potentially for the life of the host (i.e., measles and smallpox viruses). 24, 25 It is now understood that memory is defined by the persistence of specific lymphocytes and antibody-producing plasma cells, rather than persisting antigen inducing continuous lymphocyte activation. Humoral memory to viruses involves long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow that provide a continuous low-level source of serum antibody. 26 This maintenance of humoral immunity also involves a population of homeostatically maintained memory B cells. However, the precise relationship between memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells in maintaining humoral immunity is uncertain. The pool of memory T cells is regulated by low-level homeostatic division controlled by the cytokines IL-7 and IL-15. For memory CD8 T cells, IL-7 is primarily important for survival while IL-15 is crucial for low-level proliferation to maintain the size of the memory T-cell pool. 27 Immunological memory is defined by a pool of antigen-specific cells whose increased frequency enables rapid control of viral reinfection ( Fig. 27.2 ). 28 Recent studies identified a population of IL-7 receptoralpha-expressing effector cells as the precursors of this memory pool. 29 This population of cells, which constitutes ~5-10% of the effector pool, preferentially survives the contraction phase, and gradually differentiates into a stable memory population. Upon reinfection, these memory cells can be rapidly activated, and by virtue of their increased frequency mediate more rapid clearance of the viral pathogen. Moreover, repeated stimulation of memory cells via multiple infections with the same virus, or prime-boost vaccine regimes, further increases the size of the antigen-specific memory T-cell pool. 30 Re-stimulation also affects the activation status and tissue distribution of memory T cells, which may enhance protection from viral infection in mucosal, and other, tissues.",

Memory T cells have been divided into effector memory (T EM ) and central memory (T CM ) subsets, defined by expression of two surface molecules involved in T-cell migration: CD62L and CCR7. 31 The CD62L lo CCR7 lo T EM subset is found primarily in nonlymphoid tissues and spleen, whereas the CD62L hi CCR7 hi T CM subset are largely present in the lymph nodes and spleen. The current model predicts that effector T cells form the T EM subset; these cells gradually convert to a T CM phenotype over time. Though the conditions that control the rate of this conversion are unknown, it is likely that the amount of antigen and inflammatory signals received during the effector phase greatly influences this. It has also been shown that CD4 T-cell help is required for the generation of long-lived memory CD8 T cells; however, exactly when this help is required during the differentiation of effector and memory T cells is uncertain. 21 Recent studies have suggested that T CM are capable of mounting stronger proliferative responses following reinfection. However, the tissue-specific homing of T EM cells permits them to reside in sites of potential viral infection, such as the skin and mucosae. These differences may define the physiological raison d' \u00eatre for these two memory T-cell subsets. Indeed, protection from localized viral infections such as HSV-1, influenza, and vaccinia virus in mice is more dependent upon T EM cells.

            "text": "The success of many viral pathogens rests in their ability to subvert the host immune response. The most successful human viruses can escape the immune system and persist for the life of the host. 36 Two well-studied examples of this are CMV and EBV. T-cell responses to these viruses are prominent and readily detectable in people, yet the immune system is unable to clear either pathogen completely. However, these viruses generally remain undetectable in immunocompetant individuals. Other viral infections, such as those caused by the herpes viruses HSV and VZV, are marked by periods of latency, where no virus can be detected. Yet periods of viral reactivation, often triggered by stress, can lead to episodes of disease. These are controlled by the immune response which plays a central role in controlling herpes virus latency. 37 Many of the most medically important human viruses are associated with persistent viremia. These include chronic infections such as HIV, HCV, HBV, and human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), among others. 38 Such viral infections are marked by high levels of persisting antigen and can result in skewed T-cell immunodominance hierarchies, altered tissue localization of immune cells, and severely impaired T-cell function. This altered T-cell function is hierarchical and appears to correlate directly with antigen levels, resulting in functional T-cell defects ranging from reduced cytokine production and altered proliferative capacity (exhaustion) to death (deletion) of the responding T cells 38 (Fig. 27.3) . This is in stark contrast to normal memory T-cell development which occurs in the iMMuNE EVaSioN aNd iMMuNiTy To chRoNic ViRal iNfEcTioNS absence of persisting antigen (see previous section). Recent studies have demonstrated that signaling through programmed death (PD)-1 on effector CTL causes exhaustion during chronic infections. 39 This pathway may be essential for preventing excessive immunopathology by effector T cells, yet appears to contribute directly to failed immunity to HIV infection, 40 and other chronic human viral infections. 39 These studies implicate this pathway as a potential therapeutic target. n iMMuNopaThology aNd auToiMMuNiTy n Immune responses against virus-infected cells often result in tissue damage, especially if cell killing is involved. If this effect is brief and without long-term consequences, it is usually judged as an immunoprotective event. A prolonged tissue-damaging effect resulting from an immune reaction against viruses is considered immunopathology. 41 Such situations most commonly involve persistent viruses, themselves at best modestly cytodestructive in the absence of an immune reaction. Chronic tissue damage initiated by viruses may also result in the response becoming autoreactive. Accordingly, some autoimmune diseases may be initiated or exacerbated by virus infections, although this notion has yet to be proved in the case of any human autoimmune disease. 42 Circumstantial evidence exists for a virus link in multiple sclerosis (MS), insulin-dependent diabetes, and possibly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In MS, many viruses have been isolated from patients, though no specific one tied to the disease. The current hypothesis is that viral infections set up an inflammatory environment that may exacerbate or tip the balance towards disease in genetically susceptible individuals. 42 Immunopathological reactions involving viruses have several mechanisms, but T cells are usually involved as orchestrators of the inflammatory events (Table 27 .4). The clearest example of immunopathology involving a virus is lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV ) in the mouse. This model has dominated ideas and has set several paradigms in viral immunology in general. The first virus-induced immunopathology lesion recognized was glomerulonephritis and arteritis, noted in mice persistently infected with LCMV. The lesions were assumed to represent inflammatory reactions to tissue-entrapped immune complexes that activate complement. Similar immune complex-mediated lesions occur in other infections, but rarely have viral antigens been shown to contribute to the antigen component of the complex. An example where the inclusion of viral antigen in immune complexes has been demonstrated is chronic hepatitis B virus infection of humans. Autoimmune diseases such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis also result from immune complexmediated tissue damage. However, evidence linking viruses to the etiology or pathogenesis of SLE is scarce, since the immune complexes in SLE do not appear at any stage to include viral antigens.",

Initially, CTL-mediated cell killing events occurred, but since hepatocytes die by apoptosis it was not clear how this related to subsequent inflammatory events. However, the CD8 T cells also released numerous cytokines and chemokines that recruited inflammatory cells, primary macrophages. Interestingly, liver-infiltrating CTL have been shown to be inhibited by PD-1-PD-L1 interactions, which may greatly reduce the severity of local immunopathology. 44 Additional viral immunopathology models where lesions result primarily from CD8 T-cell involvement include myocarditis and insulindependent diabetes associated with coxsackie B virus infection. 42 In both instances, CD8 T cells mainly orchestrate events, but tissue damage may result from the bystander effects of cytokines. This is especially likely in the diabetes model, as the coxsackievirus cannot be demonstrated in islet cells. The diabetes model is of interest, however, because the events observed closely resemble those that occur in an autoimmune model of diabetes. However, attempts to relate viral infection directly to the etiology of human diabetes have so far failed. 42 Immunopathological reactions against virus can also involve CD4 T cells. 41 One well-studied example involves persistent infection with Theiler's virus in mice 45 (Fig. 27.4) . This infection causes a demyelinating syndrome that resembles the experimental autoimmune disease experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). In both situations, CD4 T cells that produce Th1 cytokines appear to be pathologic. Furthermore, in both models an increase in the involvement of myelin-derived autoantigens occurs as the disease progresses. Once again, such observations indicate the possible role of a virus in an autoimmune disease. With the Theiler's virus model the virus persists in the nervous system and chronically stimulates CD4 T cells to secrete an array of cytokines. The demyelinating events appear to result from cytokine action on oligodendrocytes. Myelin components such as myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, and myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein may be released and participate as additional antigens in immunoinflammatory events. This scenario is referred to as epitope spreading.",

The chronic immunoinflammatory lesions are mainly orchestrated by CD4 T cells, but multiple early events occur that induce the subsequent pathology. Viral replication, the production of certain cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, and CXCL8) and chemokines, recruitment of inflammatory cells (such as neutrophils), and neovascularization of the avascular cornea all precede immunopathology. 46 Recent work has also highlighted the role of Th17 CD4 T cells in autoimmune inflammation and immunopathology, and the role of TGF-\ufffd and IL-23 in driving these cells. 23 Whether this IL-17/IL-23 axis is important for viral pathoogenesis remains to be determined.",

The idea began for streptococci and their association with rheumatic fever. With human autoimmune disease, there is little direct support for viral molecular mimicry; however, some animal models have been used to prove the theoretical case, using a model where a viral antigen is expressed as a self-protein in the islet cells of the pancreas. In this model, subsequent infection with the virus induces diabetes. However, this is not true mimicry and may be more closely related to viral antigen persistence in a model such as Theiler's disease.",

            "text": "Recently it has become apparent that immunopathology can result from an imbalance in the types of functional effector T cells induced. Tissue damage can be the bystander consequence of a dysregulated immune response to infection. The magnitiude of the response can be influenced by the activity of one or more types of regulatory T cells (Tregs) (Chapter 16 natural CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + Tregs, which are considered important for controlling the onset of autoimmune disease. These Tregs can also influence the magnitude of the protective immune response to viruses. 48 Natural FoxP3 + Tregs, or other types of regulatory T cells that produce an abundance of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-\ufffd, are known to be involved in limiting excessive immunopathology associated with ongoing immune responses to persistent viral infection. Evidence for this has been reported in several viral infections such as HCV and HIV. 48 It is interesting to note that Treg function may be both beneficial to the host, by limiting immunopathology, and detrimental, due to reduced local T-cell responses and thus prolonged viral persistence. n coNcluSioNS n Humans are infected by several pathogenic viruses, the number of which would be far greater but for the presence of innate and adaptive mechanisms of immunity. As it is, relatively few cause major clinical problems or lethality, except when the immune response is impaired, absent, or dysfunctional. However, during immune defects pathogenic viruses become more consequential and viruses that are unremarkable agents in immunocompetent persons become highly significant. An excellent example is cytomegalovirus infection. A high proportion of the population is infected, yet only those individuals who are immunosuppressed in connection with cancer treatment, transplantation, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) caused by HIV display complications. This is true for many common bacterial and viral agents, such as HSV, whose infections become far more frequent and severe in AIDS patients. As our understanding of the mechanisms underlying innate immune defenses, antigen presentation, T-and B-cell responses and Tregs continues to improve, so too does the ability to design better vaccines and therapies to boost the immune control of viral infections. Although this remains a challenging goal, particularly for many human viruses such as HIV, HCV, and HSV, these rapid advances continue to provide many avenues for further investigation. ",

T-cell function (cytokine production, killing, and proliferative potential) is negatively influenced by increasing levels of antigen. Low levels of persistent antigen may lead to partial loss of function and intermediate levels of programmed death (PD)-1 expression. High, sustained levels of antigen over time can lead to full loss of function, high levels of PD-1, and eventually cell death (deletion). iMMuNopaThology aNd auToiMMuNiTy occurs in the leptomeninges of immunocompetent mice infected intracerebrally. Hepatitis can also occur in mice infected intravenously. Neither lesion becomes evident if the CD8 T-cell response is suppressed.
