Ten years later, humans were found to be infected with these influenza viruses [2] . A novel human influenza A (H1N1) virus caused a worldwide respiratory disease outbreak in April 2009. The major transmission route for influenza virus is via respiratory droplets released while coughing [3e5] . Influenza virus replicates in the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract, which destroys the host cells, further spreading to infect other cells. The clinical manifestations of influenza are fever, headache, myalgia, fatigue, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and cough. The impact of influenza outbreaks is much higher in children than in adults. Most healthy adults will recover after 3e7 days [6e8] . Influenza A/H3N2 was the predominant serotype during the 2010e2011 season, whereas the A/H1N1 2009 virus still cocirculated with the A/H3N2 and influenza B strains [9] . The pandemic influenza A/H1N1 outbreak resulted in over 18,449 deaths in over 214 countries until 2012 [10, 11] .",

Virus incubation is the first method used to diagnose virus infections, while it takes about 7 days to amplify the virus in the host cells. A nucleic acid amplification test is the most sensitive method to detect virus infection, but pretreatment of the sample, including virus isolation and nucleic extraction, still requires about 1 day. The above methods are not suitable for the rapid screening of influenza virus [12] . In vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs) play crucial roles in disease diagnosis because of their rapid and convenient properties. Diagnostic accuracy of IVDs is dependent on their sensitivity and specificity. A previous study evaluated the 3M rapid detection test for the respiratory syncytial virus, and found the sensitivity and specificity of the device to be 74% and 100%, respectively [13] . In April 2011, a study conducted by Iregbu et al [14] on the performance of Dual Path Platform testing kits revealed a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 99.5%. By contrast, a study by Shrivastava et al [15] reported that the commercial Dengue NS1 antigen kit had a sensitivity of 26% against 91 clinical samples. Few studies have reported the sensitivity of influenza IVDs (Flu-IVDs) in detecting influenza A. These previous studies used four commercialized rapid test kits [16e20].",

Therefore, the quality of Flu-IVDs needs to be investigated and monitored. In Taiwan, suspected influenza patients are immediately tested with Flu-IVDs at the primary screening site in epidemics areas. The therapeutic strategies are divided into two parts based on the test results. If the test result is positive and the patient exhibits influenza-like symptoms, the patient is immediately administered antiviral drugs such as osletamivir (Tamiflu) and continuously monitored with Flu PCR test kits. However, negative test results indicate that the patient only has a common cold, and no antiviral drug treatment is given. The use of Flu-IVDs plays a crucial role in controlling influenza epidemics. Hence, falsepositive outcomes may cause inappropriate administration of osletamivir, which could lead to future challenges in the prevention of influenza. Prior to 2009, several commercial Flu-IVD rapid test kits were approved in Taiwan. However, after the influenza A/H1N1 pandemics in 2009, the Taiwan FDA issued many licenses for similar products. We thus aimed to examine the analytical sensitivity and specificity of Flu A-IVDs used in Taiwan.",

            "text": "Based on the reaction principles, the detecting targets of the collected samples were grouped as HA and viral particles. The Flu-IVDs belonging to the HA group were evaluated for their analytical sensitivity with the World Health Organization (WHO) international standard Influenza Antigens A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), A/Victoria/210/2009 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/08. As shown in Table 3 , seven products of three Flu-IVD licenses (AeC) that were manufactured in the USA and Spain used HA concentrations as their sensitivity label. The analytical sensitivity of these Flu-IVDs against A/H1N1, A/ H3N2, and Flu B was 500e1000 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL, and 1000 ng/mL, respectively. For A/H1N1 detection, products A j o u r n a l o f f o o d a n d d r u g a n a l y s i s 2 2 ( 2 0 1 4 ) 2 7 9 e2 8 4 and B displayed higher analytical sensitivity than product C. The sensitivity results for A/H3N2 and Flu B were identical in these samples. We obtained seven products from three domestic Flu-IVDs (DeF) and 17 products from eight Flu-IVDs (GeN) imported from China, the UK, Finland, Singapore, USA, and Korea with CCID 50 labels. In the past 5 years, type A/ Taiwan/439/2009 (H3N2) and type A/Taiwan/9042/2008 (H1N1) were the two main strains of influenza outbreak in Taiwan. Hence, these two virus strains were used as influenza viral particle standards for CCID 50 test [22] . The averages of A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 sensitivity were log 10 5.8 AE 0.5 CCID 50 /mL and log 10 6.6 AE 0.5 CCID 50 /mL, respectively. In Fig. 1 , the unbroken, broken, and dotted lines represent the mean, mean AE 1 standard deviation (SD) and mean AE 2 SD in the sensitivity tests, respectively. For A/H1N1, the sensitivity of all products was within mean AE 1 SD (Fig. 1A) . As to A/H3N2 sensitivity, however, the products E, I, L, and M fell into the mean AE 2 SD range (Fig. 1B) . Seven products from five imported Flu-IVDs did not have test sensitivity labeling. Therefore, HA concentrations were used to determine their sensitivities. In Table 4 , the sensitivities of these seven samples against H1N1, H3N2, and Flu B were 500e1000 ng/mL, 500e3250 ng/mL, and 1000e6750 ng/mL, respectively. Previous researchers have used clinical specimens to monitor the clinical performance of Flu-IVDs. A study by Drexler et al [17] found that BinaxNow Influenza A&B Rapid Test Kits had a poor clinical sensitivity; the sensitivity was 11.1% for the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus (16 positive cases against 144 polymerase-chain-reaction-confirmed cases). A study by Uyeki et al [20] also showed that the QuickVue Influenza A \u00fe B Test had a low sensitivity (27%) for the detection of both influenza A and B viruses. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention screened 45 specimens with positive results for novel influenza A (H1N1) using Directigen EZ Flu A \u00fe B and obtained a sensitivity of 49% [23] .",

Pandemic influenza virus strains varied from year to year and from country to country. For example, the influenza A/Texas/1/77 strain was used as the master influenza virus strain to develop the monoclonal antibodies in the BinaxNow Influenza A&B Rapid Test; however, the major virus strain that caused the influenza outbreak in Taiwan was the type A/Taiwan/439/2009 (H3N2) and type A/Taiwan/9042/ 2008 (H1N1). Other Flu-IVDs failed to mention the master influenza virus strain used in their preparations. Therefore, inappropriate master influenza virus strains used in the Flu-IVD preparations may contribute to the low detection sensitivity. Moreover, studies have shown that analytical sensitivity did not directly reflect the clinical sensitivity on patient specimens. The analytical sensitivity of influenza H5N1 detection and seasonal influenza was the same, although their clinical performances were poor [23, 24] .
