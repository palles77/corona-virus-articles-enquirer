Objectives: To study the best approach for the diagnosis of human metapneumovirus infections by both conventional and molecular methods, along with the human metapneumovirus circulation rate in northern Italy and the severity of human metapneumovirus respiratory infections in a pediatric patient population. Study design: Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were taken from 306 pediatric patients during the winter-spring season 2003-2004, and examined for conventional respiratory viruses by direct fluorescent staining and cell culture, while human coronavirus and human metapneumovirus were sought by RT-PCR. Results: RT-PCR detected human metapneumovirus in 40/306 (13.1%) children positive for respiratory viruses, with an incidence intermediate between that of respiratory syncytial virus (58 patients, 18.9%) and that of influenzavirus infections (29 patients, 9.5%). Phylogenetic analysis showed cocirculation of both human metapneumovirus types (A and B) as well as their relevant subtypes (A1-A2 and B1-B2). Clinically, human metapneumovirus was found to be second to human respiratory syncytial virus alone, as a cause of respiratory tract infections, while duration of virus excretion appeared to correlate with severity of infection, and virus load in NPA with the stage of respiratory infection. Conclusion: (i) Human metapneumovirus is a major viral pathogen in the Italian pediatric patient population; (ii) the severity of lower respiratory tract infections approaches that of human respiratory syncytial virus; (iii) there are preliminary indications that the duration of virus excretion may reach 2-3 weeks and that the level of viral load in NPA correlates with the clinical stage of human metapneumovirus infection.",

It is known that human metapneumovirus is a member (Van den Hoogen et al., 2002) of the same family (Paramyxoviridae) and subfamily (Pneumovirinae) of human respiratory syncytial virus, but belongs to a different genus (Metapneumovirus instead of Pneumovirus). The major reason why human metapneumovirus has not been recovered previously from respiratory specimens is due to its difficulty to grow in cell cultures conventionally adopted for isolation of respiratory viruses. The recent identification of human metapneumovirus, first in The Netherlands and then in other countries, has been made possible by the use of molecular assays and, in particular, of the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).",

In addition, the duration of virus excretion during acute infection remains to be defined. Furthermore, as with other paramyxoviruses (Glezen et al., 1986) such as human respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus reinfections have been reported both in the immunocompetent (Van den Hoogen et al., 2003; Esper et al., 2004) and the immunocompromised host , yet this finding awaits confirmation.",

Some patients were dismissed the same day, following completion of clinical, laboratory and radiological tests, whereas others were admitted to the Respiratory Disease Ward because of a more severe clinical presentation. Each NPA sample was divided into four aliquots: the first was used for molecular assays; the second was used for direct fluorescent antibody staining of NPA respiratory cells; the third was inoculated onto cell cultures for virus isolation (see below); the fourth was frozen in multiple aliquots as a backup sample. Specimens were examined for influenzaviruses A and B, parainfluenzaviruses types 1-4, human respiratory syncytial virus types A and B, and human adenoviruses by direct fluorescent antibody staining, and by short-and long-term virus isolation in cell cultures. In addition, human coronavirus strains, groups I (229E-like) and II (OC43-like), and human metapneumoviruses, types A and B, were sought by RT-PCR. Classification and typing of human respiratory syncytial virus strains was achieved by RT-PCR, grouping of human coronavirus strains by sequencing, and typing of human metapneumovirus strains by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis (see below). The study was approved by the IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Ethics Committee. In this study, the simultaneous detection of two respiratory viruses in the same NPA was referred to as coinfection, while the subsequent identification of two different respiratory viruses in two NPAs taken within 30 days from each other was considered as a sequential infection.",

Thus, while the original primer pair was kept for detection of type A strains, a new primer set matching the same nt position was designed on the basis of gene L sequences published in GenBank for type B strains. As a result, several type B strains could be detected retrospectively in our patient series already examined, while starting from 1 March 2004, patients were prospectively investigated by using both pairs of primers in a mixture. In addition, a fragment of the human metapneumovirus gene N (nt 80-nt 596) was amplified to confirm results obtained by amplifying the gene L and to construct the phylodendrogram by using degenerate primers, as reported in Table 1 . Initially, following inoculation of two NPA samples strongly positive for human metapneumovirus by RT-PCR, virus isolation was attempted, following overnight adsorption, in sAGMK, LLC-MK2, Vero, and HEp-2 fed with E-MEM containing trypsin (2 g/ml) in the absence of fetal calf serum. Inoculated cell cultures were incubated at 37 \u2022 C ( Table 2) . A positive RT-PCR signal was detected in the supernatant of all three cell cultures types at 7-14 days after inoculation. Following the first passage of the whole cell cultures (cells and supernatant) onto homologous cells, viral RNA signal increased in sAGMK and markedly decreased in Vero and HEp-2 cells. Upon second passage, the RNA signal further increased in sAGMK, while it disappeared in Vero and HEp-2 cells. At this time, propagation of the two human metapneumovirus isolates onto HELF and LLC-MK2 was attempted. As shown in Table 2 , while the attempt failed in HELF after two passages, it was successful in LLC-MK2 for both human metapneumovirus strains.",

It was preliminarily observed that human metapneumovirus was often excreted with respiratory secretions for more than 10 days. In more detail, the duration of human metapneumovirus excretion in the eight children undergoing multiple sampling during follow-up showed a trend towards persistence of virus shedding for more than 2-3 weeks in patients with pneumonia or bronchiolitis, whereas patients with upper respiratory tract involvement shed virus mostly for less than 7 days. In addition, as shown for patients reported in Table 3 , the highest viral RNA titer was detected concomitantly with the peak of clinical symptoms interesting either the upper or the lower respiratory tract, while the decrease in viral load was mostly associated with the resolution of local clinical symptoms.

However, we and others (Maertzdorf et al., 2004) observed that some strains could not be detected by the RT-PCR method using the L6-L7 primer pair originally used by Van den Hoogen et al. (2001) for human metapneumovirus detection because of a number of mismatches with respect to the target sequences of the four genetic lineages and, particularly, of the two sublineages B (B1 and B2). In fact, when we designed a new primer pair on the basis of the published sequences of the gene L of human metapneumovirus B strains, a new series of human metapneumovirus-positive NPA samples was identified among previously negative respiratory specimens, as determined by using L6-L7 primer pair. Subsequently, a mixture of the two primer pairs was routinely employed for human metapneumovirus detection in clinical samples. As a result, types and subtypes A and B of human metapneumovirus strains could be detected. In this respect, it seems important to recall that real-time RT-PCR specific for gene N has been shown to be more sensitive than RT-PCRs specific for genes L, F, M, and P of human metapneumovirus strains (C\u00f6t\u00e9 et al., 2003) .",

Why has human metapneumovirus been detected about 50 years after initiation of Medical Virology, i.e. after introduction of cell culture technology? Obvious answer to this question is the recent extended use of molecular techniques. However, tertiary AGMK cell cultures have been essential for the initial human metapneumovirus detection in respiratory samples (Van den Hoogen et al., 2001) and, subsequently, several groups have reported human metapneumovirus isolation in conventional cell cultures such as AGMK or HEp-2 or in well-known cell lines such as LLC-MK2 Chan et al., 2003; Hamelin et al., 2004; Van den Hoogen et al., 2004b) . Very recently, a subclone of Vero cells has been mentioned as particularly susceptible to human metapneumovirus isolation (Van den Hoogen et al., 2004b) . Our study confirms that the most sensitive cell cultures systems for human metapneumovirus CPE detection are AGMK and LLC-MK2. In this respect, LLC-MK2 cells may be preferable since widely available and giving a clear-cut, although delayed, CPE. It is well known that, among avian MPV (aMPV) four different types (A, B, C, and D) have been thus far identified. This suggests that a parallel cultural and molecular approach to diagnosis of human metapneumovirus infections may be desirable in view of the potential identification of new human metapneumovirus types.",

This was documented by the fact that, unlike patients infected by other viruses and in agreement with previous reports (Bastien et al., 2003; Maggi et al., 2003) , the number of human respiratory syncytial virus-infected was significantly greater than that of human metapneumovirus-infected inpatients, while the relative proportion of inpatients with lower respiratory tract infections as well as the number of children with double infections was comparable in the two groups. However, both coinfections and sequential infections appeared to be a more severe prognostic factor, since they were nearly exclusively detected in inpatients. As for duration of human metapneumovirus excretion, it appeared to be even longer than that previously reported (Van den Hoogen et al., 2004b) . This may represent a route of virus dissemination after resolution of acute clinical symptoms and in the presence of low viral load in NPAs. Our data on the correlation of viral load in NPA and clinical symptoms support this conclusion.",

Levels of viral RNA detected in the respiratory tract during the acute phase of a respiratory disease are somewhat comparable to those found in the upper respiratory tract of experimentally infected hamsters (Skiadopoulos et al., 2004) . However, it is important to recall that experimental animal models, including nonhuman primates, do not mimic human metapneumovirus disease, even though high levels of neutralizing antibodies which are cross-protective against heterologous strains can be induced (MacPhail et al., 2004; Skiadopoulos et al., 2004) .",
