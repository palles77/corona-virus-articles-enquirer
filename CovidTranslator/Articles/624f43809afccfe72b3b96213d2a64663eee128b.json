It is characterized by an acute or subacute encephalopathy with polyfocal neurological deficits, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of widespread demyelination that predominantly involves the white matter of the brain and spinal cord (Wingerchuk, 2003; Menge et al., 2007; Tenembaum et al., 2007) . In the absence of specific biological markers, the diagnosis of ADEM is still based upon a combination of clinical and neuroimaging features and exclusion of diseases that mimic ADEM.",

White matter lesions are typically multiple, bilateral, asymmetrical, and random in distribution, involving cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord (Kesselring et al., 1990; Hynson et al., 2001; Wingerchuk, 2003) . Deep gray matter lesions tend to be symmetrical and often involve the thalamus and basal ganglia (Tenembaum et al., 2002) . Lesions confined to the corpus callosum are less common. However, large demyelinating lesions of the adjacent white matter may extend into the corpus callosum. Spinal cord involvement in ADEM has been described in 11-28% of children as swollen and confluent intramedullary lesions with variable enhancement.",

A previously healthy, developmentally normal, 3-year-old boy presented at a local emergency department after 48 hours of emesis, intermittent fever, and lethargy, 1 week after an upper respiratory viral infection. The subsequent neurological involvement included general weakness, drooling, and inability to walk, and he required admission to hospital.

A brain MRI was performed revealing widespread, hyperintense lesions in central and juxta-cortical white matter (A, axial T2-weighted image). Tumefactive lesions involving deep gray and white matter on the right with mass effect were also identified (B, coronal T2-weighted image). ADEM was diagnosed based on clinical and MRI picture and CSF studies including negative viral cultures and viral PCR assays. The child showed rapid improvement following intravenous corticosteroid treatment.

In a retrospective study of brain MRI scans obtained at first attack from children subsequently diagnosed with MS and ADEM (Callen et al., 2009) , the presence of any two of the following MRI features indicated an increased risk of developing MS: (1) absence of a diffuse bilateral lesion pattern; (2) presence of black holes; and (3) presence of two or more periventricular lesions. More recently, the presence of at least one T1-weighted hypointense lesion (hazard ratio 20.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.46-78.0) or at least one periventricular lesion (3.34, 1.27-8.83) on the initial brain scan was associated with an increased risk of MS diagnosis, with a sensitivity of 84%, specificity of 93%, positive predictive value 76%, and negative predictive value 96% (Verhey et al., 2011) . And the risk for MS diagnosis was highest when both parameters were present (hazard ratio 34.27, 95% CI 16.69-70.38).The predictive value of the proposed brain MRI criteria needs to be confirmed and validated in different pediatric MS cohorts.",

Although early diagnostic criteria for NMO suggested that the brain MRI should be relatively free of white matter lesions, recent publications provide evidence of a broader spectrum, including brain lesions consistent with ADEM and MS. The most widely accepted diagnostic criteria for NMO (Wingerchuk et al., 2006) are based on the clinical manifestations and additional specificity criteria that discriminate patients with NMO from those with MS, the most specific of which is an IgG autoantibody biomarker. The discovery of antibodies directed against the water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4), NMO-IgG, has allowed a broadening of the NMO spectrum, which recognizes the involvement of CNS structures beyond the optic nerves and spinal cord. Indeed, a pattern of brain involvement has been delineated in which the hypothalamic and periventricular areas are mainly affected, particularly in children presenting with an ADEM-like event (Banwell et al., 2008; Lotze et al., 2008) , with large brain MRI lesions with no enhancement, or showing a \"cloud-like enhancement,\" a finding described as specific to NMO.",

This results in a monophasic, autoimmune demyelinating syndrome of weakness with diffuse CNS demyelination.

The pathogens have the capacity to activate myelin-reactive T cell clones and can thereby elicit a CNS-specific autoimmune response. Thus, it has been suggested that microbial infections or vaccinations may elicit a cross-reactive antimyelin response through molecular mimicry, resulting in ADEM. Various sequences of myelin peptides have been shown to resemble several viral sequences, and in some cases crossreactive T cell responses have been demonstrated. Examples of cross-reactive T cell responses with myelin basic protein (MBP) antigens include human herpesvirus (HHV) 6, coronavirus, influenza virus, and Epstein-Barr virus. Proteolipid protein (PLP) shares common sequences with Hemophilus influenzae, and Semliki Forest virus peptides mimic myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG).",

The resulting tissue damage is thought to disrupt the blood-brain barrier, exposing CNS-confined autoantigens into the circulation where they are processed by the peripheral immune system. This process leads to a breakdown of tolerance, resulting in a self-directed autoimmune attack against the CNS driven by encephalitogenic T cells. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) may be a good model for postinfectious etiology. TMEV-IDD is induced by direct CNS infection with the neurotropic TMEV picornavirus in genetically susceptible mice, inducing diffuse CNS inflammation and demyelination. Initially the primary immune-mediated reaction involves TMEV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells. During the chronic stages of the disease, T cell reactivity to host CNS myelin peptides has been observed. This suggests that epitope spreading may have occurred with the appearance of secondary T cell responses to myelin breakdown products. The TMEV model highlights the phenomenon of epitope spreading which is initiated by a destructive CNS viral infection resulting in a secondary autoimmune response to myelin components.",

HLA-DRB1*1501 has been shown to bind effectively the immunodominant epitope of myelin basic protein, thus suggesting a link to the myelin hypothesis of MS pathogenesis. Recent studies established a link between genetics and viral diseases. Most cases of ANE, a distinct form of acute encephalopathy triggered by influenza A infection, are sporadic. The identification of recurrent and familial cases of ANE due to a mutation in the RANBP2 gene provided new evidence of the importance of genetic risk factors for an environmentally triggered neurological disease.
