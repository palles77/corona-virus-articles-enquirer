Different tree-building methods consistently place the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as a basal Group 2 coronavirus rather than as an ungrouped species as concluded by others. Detailed comparisons of the SARS-CoV genomic sequence with those of six other coronaviruses failed to find evidence of recombination or genomic rearrangement using computational methods designed for that purpose. * In their report of the SARS-CoV genomic sequence, Marra et al. [4] constructed unrooted phylogenetic trees by boot strapped distance methods using the encoded major protein sequences of SARS-CoV and representatives of the three coronavirus groups and reported that those encoded by SARS-CoV \"do not cluster more closely with any one group\", and concluded that SARS-CoV should \"be considered the first representative of \"Group 4\" coronaviruses\". Likewise Rota et al. [5] using the same methods reported that SARS-CoV \"is approximately equidistant from all previously characterized coronaviruses\" and \"forms a distinct group within the genus Coronavirus\". However neither of those studies had outgroup sequences in the analyses, and therefore it was not possible to be sure whether SARS-CoV showed consistent relationships with other coronaviruses.",

Differences in the enzymic specificity of the HE gene, and congruent gene sequence differences, place Group 2 coronaviruses into two sub-groups; the MHV-like (Group 2a) and BCV-like (Group 2b) viruses [10] . We therefore suggest that it will be most useful to consider SARS-CoV as a Group 2c coronavirus, and to represent the original Group 2 lineage from which the Group 2a and 2b lineages were derived after acquiring a progenitor HE gene rather than as the first species of a novel group, as an emphasis on taxonomic similarities, rather than differences, may generate more useful predictions.",
