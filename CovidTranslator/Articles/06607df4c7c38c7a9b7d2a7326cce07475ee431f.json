We found that, compared to seronegative controls, mice that were seropositive at least to Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) and Mycoplasma pulmonis: (i) exhibited a higher interindividual variability in all the parameters quantifying metastatic progression; (ii) had elevated serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines both before and at the end of the experiment; (iii) were more susceptible to hepatic metastasis. Interestingly, final levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interleukin (IL)-18 correlated with the extent of hepatic colonization by the melanoma cells. To confirm the metastasis-enhancing effect of MHV and M. pulmonis we measured the ability of B16M cells to metastasize in pathogen-free animals housed for increasing time-intervals in the vicinity of MHV + animals. Notably, susceptibility to metastasis was lower in animals seronegative to MHV than in MHV + mice, whereas the latter were less susceptible to metastasis than MHV + M. pulmonis + mice. Seropositive animals had increased levels of TNF-a and IL-18 suggesting that MHV and M. pulmonis enhance the metastatic ability of melanoma cells by inducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines. While our results highlight the importance of using pathogen-free animals in metastasis studies, they emphasize the need for a comprehensive health monitoring of the mice used in such studies, particularly in case of using facilities lacking appropriate containment measures.",

Interference due to microorganisms can also affect the validity of metastasis studies since it has been reported that many microbial infections are able to alter the immune response or even interfere with the pattern of progression of certain tumors [1, 3] . As a consequence, microorganisms that were classically considered as mere commensals have been shown to significantly affect the pattern of proinflammatory cytokines and therefore the relevance of their presence in an experimental animal needs to be re-evaluated [4] .",

In addition, we have demonstrated that commercial animals inoculated with LPS before melanoma cell administration had levels of TNF-a and IL-18 at the end of the experiment that were indistinguishable from those detected in the in-house animals that were given placebo instead of LPS. This phenomenon indicates that inoculation of LPS in commercial animals gives rise to a proinflammatory situation in these animals similar to that naturally displayed by the in-house animals, suggesting that underlying infections by MHV and M. pulmonis have a stimulatory effect similar to that of LPS.
