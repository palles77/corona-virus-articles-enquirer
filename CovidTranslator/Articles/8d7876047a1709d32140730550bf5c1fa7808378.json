However, the increase in CD8 and B cells was not signifi cant. Another study showed a decrease in CD4, CD8, and B cells \u22642 days of symptom onset in patients with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 than in healthy persons (4). Our results show impaired adaptive immune responses and a gradual increase during recovery in mildly affected patients. We measured serum cytokine concentrations and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers in patients during hospitalization and the follow-up period ( Figure  2 ). We observed an increase in interleulin-6 (IL-6) levels 1 day after illness onset, which were 6.0-fold higher than the baseline level, and a 2.3-fold increase in interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) levels. These levels decreased to baseline levels 5 days after illness onset, although the IL-6 level 5 days after illness onset was higher than levels 15 and 37 days after illness onset. The maximum IL-10 level 1 day after symptom onset was 3.2-fold higher than the baseline level. This level decreased to a value lower than the baseline level within 4 days, and then gradually increased to the baseline level 37 days after illness onset. Serum IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-10 levels were not related to patient temperature 1 day after symptom onset, peak temperature during the disease, or period of fever. These levels showed minor differences that were not related to cough or sore throat in patients.",

However, similar to another report (4), we detected increases of IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 levels in patients with mild disease during the fi rst 3 days after symptom onset. These different patterns may be caused by different intervals from time of symptom onset to date of sample collection (5 days vs. 3 days) because IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 levels in our study quickly decreased to baseline levels \u22647 days after symptom onset. These results suggest that serum IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 , and IL-6 are medians (pg/mL). Serum HAI antibody titers were transformed by using the natural logarithm and are shown as means. Baseline cytokine concentrations on the y-axis are values for healthy persons. *p<0.05 when IL-6 or HAI antibody levels were compared with those at day 5; \u2020p<0.05 when IL-10 level was compared with those at baseline; \u2021p<0.05 when IL-10 level was compared with those at days 5 or 15; \u00a7p<0.05 when value was compared with that at any other time point; \u00b6p<0.05 when value was compared with those at days 5, 15, or 49. levels may be increased in patients with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 within the fi rst 3 days after symptom onset, followed by a decrease to baseline levels \u22645 days after symptom onset in patients with mild disease or a continuous increase in severely affected patients. IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 are associated with antiviral immune responses during infl uenza infection (6) (7) (8) . However, continuous, excessive release of IL-6 three days after illness onset likely contributed to serious pulmonary infl ammation and tissue injury, as has been documented for severe acute respiratory syndrome and 1918 pandemic infl uenza, but this release could be tempered by production of IL-10 (6, 7, (9) (10) (11) .",
