The murine antisera induced were fully-neutralising in vitro for two separate clinical strains of the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). To test the neutralising capacity of these antisera in vivo, susceptibility to MERS-CoV was induced in naive recipient Balb/c mice by the administration of an adenovirus vector expressing the human DPP4 receptor (Ad5-hDPP4) for MERS-CoV, prior to the passive transfer of the RBD-specific murine antisera to the transduced mice. Subsequent challenge of the recipient transduced mice by the intra-nasal route with a clinical isolate of the MERS-CoV resulted in a significantly reduced viral load in their lungs, compared with transduced mice receiving a negative control antibody. The murine antisera used were derived from mice which had been primed subcutaneously with a recombinant fusion of RBD with a human IgG Fc tag (RBD-Fc), adsorbed to calcium phosphate microcrystals and then boosted by the oral route with the same fusion protein in reverse micelles. The data gained indicate that this dual-route vaccination with novel formulations of the RBD-Fc, induced systemic and mucosal anti-viral immunity with demonstrated in vitro and in vivo neutralisation capacity for clinical strains of MERS-CoV.

Since then, there have been an estimated 2311 laboratory-confirmed cases with 811 deaths, reported from a total of 27 countries in the eastern Mediterranean region and from 12 countries elsewhere [1] . Saudi Arabia, however, remains the main focus of infection and a disease outbreak in South Korea involving 186 cases was traced back to an index case who had travelled from Saudi Arabia. Whilst the incidence of MERS cases in Saudi Arabia peaked in 2014, there are still a significant number of cases reported from the country and in the period September 2012-May 2018, there were 1844 cases including 716 deaths with a case fatality rate of 38.8% [1] . MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a member of the betacoronavirus genus [3] and as for other betacoronaviruses, bats may provide a natural reservoir for the virus [3, 4] , but high levels of antibodies to MERS-CoV in dromedary camels [5] suggest that the dromedary camel is the principal source for animal-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV [6] . However, evidence of human-to-human transmission comes from the reporting of outbreaks in countries remote from Saudi Arabia such as the UK, Europe, USA, and China where small outbreaks have also occurred [1] .",

The spike protein comprises an S1 sub-unit and a membrane fusion S2 sub-unit. In the coronaviruses, the S1 sub-units are further divided into N-terminal and C-terminal subdomains and for MERS-CoV, it is the C-terminal sub-domain that comprises the receptor-binding domain (RBD) [8] . The RBD also incorporates a receptor-binding motif at its C-terminal and the crystal structures of MERS-CoV RBD [8] and of the RBD bound to the extracellular domain of human DPP4 have been reported [9] .",

To this end, we have used a dual route immunisation regimen in Balb/c mice to induce both systemic and mucosal immunity, to generate RBD-specific murine antisera. Initially, we immunised Balb/c mice sub-cutaneously (s.c.) with RBD-Fc in the MF59 adjuvant to induce RBD-specific IgG. Subsequently, we have immunised further groups of Balb/c mice by s.c. priming and per oral (p.o.) boosting with the RBD-Fc, to induce both systemic IgG and mucosal IgA responses. To do this, we have used novel formulations of RBD-Fc coated onto microcrystals formed from histidine or glutamine and also incorporating calcium phosphate for sub-cutaneous priming [17] , whilst the formulation for oral boosting comprised RBD-Fc in reverse micelles dispersed in a self-emulsifying oil phase, which has been optimised from previous formulations [18, 19] . The advantages of these formulations are that they are very stable under extremes of temperature [20] . Furthermore, on translation to the clinic, only one injected priming dose would be required, followed by a p.o. booster dose; the latter could be self-administered in capsule form. We have compared the relative abilities of the two sources of antiserum to neutralise clinical isolates of MERS-CoV in vitro. To do this, we have used two clinical strains of MERS-CoV (Erasmus Medical Center 2012 or EMC2012 and London1-2012:), each of which were derived from severely-ill individuals who had contracted the virus in the Middle East in 2012. Subsequent sequencing of the polymerase gene from these isolates indicated them to be newly-emerged members of the betacoronavirus genus with a close sequence homology and phylogenetic relationship to the bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU-5 [21, 22] .",

To determine if the presentation of RBD-Fc in either alhydrogel or MF59 influenced the ability to develop virus-neutralising antibody, antisera were selected from 2 mice in each immunisation group and tested in a plaque assay for neutralisation of both the EMC2012 and London1-2012 strains of MERS-CoV ( Fig. 2B and C) . All four sera gave some neutralisation of viral activity, although at a 1:20 dilution, sera 136 and 169 were most potent, against both viral strains.

For this, we selected novel formulations in which RBD-Fc protein was presented as RBD-Fc-PCMC for s.c. priming and incorporated into mineral oil (MO) for p.o. boosting. We compared the serum IgG response achieved from this 2-dose dual route immunisation with that induced to RBD-Fc delivered in MF59 in a 2-dose s.c. regimen (Fig. 3) . At 1 month after the booster dose, at day 49, there was no significant difference in the serum IgG titres achieved, so that the 2-dose dual-route immunisation with RBD-Fc-PCMC for s.c. priming and incorporated in MO with excipients for p.o. boosting, was just as immunogenic as the 2-dose s.c. immunisation with RBD-Fc in MF59 (Fig. 3A) .

We were interested in determining the advantage of r a vaccine which could induce mucosal as well as specific systemic immunity to the key target, the RBD protein, in order to achieve optimum protective efficacy. Vaccination to induce effective immunity at mucosal surfaces, should prime the immune system to respond rapidly to invading pathogens such as MERS-CoV. Previous studies have used adenovirus delivery of the MERS Spike protein with intra-muscular (i.m.) or intra-gastric (i.g.) delivery to induce neutralising systemic IgG, but not IgA; further, whilst i.m. delivery also induced specific T-cell immunity, i.g. delivery did not [29] . Others have shown that intra-nasal delivery of a live attenuated adenovirus-vectored subunit vaccines does induce specific mucosal as well as systemic immunity, although translation of this approach to the clinic may raise safety issues [30] . Here, we have relied on novel formulations of a sub-unit protein to enable dual route vaccination (parenteral and oral) to induce mucosal as well as systemic immunity.",

To counter a viral infection, it would be expected that a Th1 response would be most appropriate. However, the fact that neutralising antibody to RBD-Fc was raised under either Th1 or Th2-polarising influences, suggests that either isotype can be protective and primes the immune system sufficiently and would allow for cross-presentation to occur on subsequent exposure to the virus [31] . In this study, we have not examined the induction of a cell-mediated memory response to the RBD-Fc protein, although this will play a significant role in protection against the virus.",

The Fc tag may contribute additional adjuvantising activity by engaging antigen-presenting cells in the vaccinee [32] and it may aid mucosal immunity since the Fc receptor, an MHC1 transmembrane protein, is also expressed at mucosal surfaces e.g. in the respiratory tract [33] . Vaccination of the zoonotic host, the dromedary camel, may also effectively curb outbreaks of MERS in endemic regions and limit the risk of viral recombination [34] and significant progress with an orthopox-vectored vaccine for MERS has recently been reported [35] . The potential use of a sub-unit vaccine for MERS in camel vaccination could be aided by varying the sequence of the RBD protein [36] and substituting the human Fc tag with an alternative tag recognised by the camel, to design approaches tailored for animal vaccination, bearing in mind that a single dose vaccine would be ideal in this context. However, future work in our laboratory will also address the value of retaining or removing the Fc tag from the RBD protein for clinical or veterinary iterations of the vaccine.",

In future work, it will be worthwhile to test the efficacy of this approach against other clinical isolates of MERS-CoV. This is the first report of a dual route dosing regimen applied to a sub-unit vaccine for MERS-CoV. Future development of this approach would require the direct testing of efficacy in the immunised transduced mouse model. As well as giving a direct readout of vaccine efficacy, this will enable the identification of the immune correlates of protection, ready for transitioning this candidate vaccine into more extensive pre-clinical testing and clinical development.",
