Tukey honest significant difference post hoc test indicated that year 2 and year 4 students had better SPs compliance than year 3 students. Further analysis using a univariate general linear model identified an interaction effect of perceived influence of nursing staff and year of study (F 1,593 \u00bc 3.72; P < .05). The 5 following predictors for SPs compliance were identified: knowledge of SPs, perceived barriers, adequacy of training, management support, and influence of nursing staff. Conclusion: Although the SPs compliance among NSs was high, the compliance varied by year of study and was affected by the nursing staff. Furthermore, SPs compliance among NSs can be enhanced by increasing SPs knowledge, providing more SPs training, promoting management support, reducing identified SPs barriers, and improving nursing staff compliance to SPs.",

            "text": "Nursing students (NSs) are at high risk of exposure to occupational biologic hazards because they are obligated to provide care to patients admitted with an unknown infection status. 1 Owing to the nature of the work, health care workers (HCWs) are 3 times and 5 times more likely to acquire tuberculosis 2 and hepatitis B (HB), 3 respectively, than the general population. Thirty-seven percent of HB and 10% of AIDS among HCWs are the result of occupational exposure. 4 In 2003, within 8 months of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, it had spread rapidly to 30 countries, 8,096 people were infected, and 774 died from severe acute respiratory syndrome. 5 Among those infected, 21% (n \u00bc 1,706) were HCWs. 5 In the last 10 years, the reported cases of avian and swine influenza around the world, and lately the novel coronavirus in the United Kingdom (UK) 6 and avian influenza A, 7 signify the possibility of virus mutation and person-to-person transmission. These uncertainties on infectious diseases continue to pose a threat to the health of HCWs. 6 Although HCWs face the challenge of emerging infectious diseases and pandemics, standard precautions (SPs) have been proven by evidence-based research as \"the foundation for prevention transmission of infectious agents in all healthcare settings.\" 8 Hence, HCWs are required to treat patients as potentially infectious 9 and apply SPs routinely. 1 However, HCWs adopt SPs depending on their own perception of risk of contracting the infectious disease in each clinical situation. 10 The compliance of SPs among HCWs is exceptionally low. For nurses, the compliance of SPs ranged from 9.1%-73%. 9, 11 Factors affecting SPs compliance among registered nurses included individual factors (eg, age, 12 sex, 13 knowledge 14 ), psychosocial factors (eg, risk-taking personality, 15 perceived susceptibility 16 ) , and organizational factors (eg, safety climate). 17 Still, limited studies have been conducted to investigate the compliance of and factors affecting SPs among NSs. 18 Worldwide, NSs in preregistration programs are required to provide nursing care in clinical practice. 19 In addition, their knowledge acquired and compliance of SPs during their nursing training years might affect their practice as they become registered nurses. A review of the literature found that only 2 studies, conducted in Italy and Brazil, have examined the compliance of some aspects of SPs in NSs 18, 20 ; and 4 studies examined knowledge of infection control preventive measures among NSs in France, Italy, Taiwan, and the United States. [20] [21] [22] [23] However, no investigations to our knowledge have been carried out on the factors affecting the compliance of SPs among NSs. Theoretical frameworks have been used to guide studies on SPs among registered nurses, 12, 24 but not in NSs. Furthermore, the sample size of those studies conducted among NSs was relatively small, ranging from 48-175 participants in 1 particular year of study. 18, 20, 21, 23 It remains unclear whether NSs' compliance of SPs would be affected by registered nurses in the clinical settings. 18 Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the factors affecting the compliance of SPs among NSs.",

However, 19.1% (n \u00bc 122) of them often or always recapped needles contaminated with blood; 13.8% (n \u00bc 89) and 14.7% (n \u00bc 94) rarely or never wore eye protection equipment whenever there was a possibility of blood-body fluids or secretions-excretions splashing in their face, respectively. Furthermore, the results of 1-way analysis of variance indicated that the SPs compliance varied by year of study (F 3,628 \u00bc 4.09; P < .01) ( Table 2 ). The SP compliance for year 2 (mean, 4.41 AE 0.40) and year 4 (mean, 4.42 AE 0.38) students was significantly better than that of year 3 students (mean, 4.28 AE 0.37) as determined with the Tukey honest significant difference post hoc test.",

Furthermore, year 3 NSs had the lowest SPs compliance in the 4-year undergraduate program. A Bachelor of Science in Nursing is a 4-year program in Hong Kong. First-and second-year NSs are supervised by university clinical instructors, whereas second-year specialty and third-and fourth-year students were supervised by nursing staff in the clinical venue. It would be logical for the first year NSs to follow the SPs taught in the school because they were supervised by university clinical instructors. However, it is noteworthy that NSs were particularly affected by the nursing staff in the ward in their second and third year but not fourth year of clinical placement. Perhaps, the qualitative interview study results 37 conducted in the UK might provide some explanations. A Bachelor of Science in Nursing is a 3-year program in the UK, but only second-and third-year NSs were involved in the Ward study. 37 The study results found that poor practice by nursing staff observed by the NSs could have both negative and positive effects on their infection control practices. Some NSs would lower their infection control standards to fit in with the ward practice, whereas some would reflect on the poor practice observed and strive to maintain a high level of infection control practice. Furthermore, NSs' confidence on their infection control practice accumulated over their course of study, and this also increased their possibility of reporting poor infection control practice. 37 This might explain why fourth-year NSs were not as affected by nursing staff as much as those in their second and third years because they have the confidence to practice what they believe as the proper infection control practices.",

The purpose of the HBM is to identify the factors which can improve the likelihood of compliance to SPs among NSs. However, the underlying reasons why NSs might be affected by those factors might not be well explained by the HBM. Theory-in-use 38 might shine some light on the explanation of such findings in the present study. To apply the theory in the context of SPs compliance, theory-in-use is the performance of the behaviors related to the SPs compliance, whereas espoused theory is to explain or justify the behaviors related to the SPs compliance. Argyris and Schon 38 explained that theory-in-use (ie, actual practice and self-reported practice) of an individual worker is shaped by espoused theory, that is, his/her formal (eg, policies, guidelines) and informal (eg, observation, organizational culture) learning in the workplace. In terms of SPs compliance among NSs, increasing SPs knowledge, providing more SPs training, promoting a safety climate (management support), reducing identified SPs barriers, and improving nursing staff compliance to SPs would enhance NSs' SPs compliance.",

Both qualitative studies in the UK 37,39 found that NSs intended to fit in with the clinical practices even though they knew the clinical staff did not comply with the SPs. In addition, NSs worried that their clinical performance evaluation would be negatively affected if they confronted the clinical staff about their improper infection control practices. 39 As a result, a comprehensive supporting program empowering students is recommended. Before clinical placement, assertiveness training 39 coupled with communication skills is suggested to empower NSs to handle challenges in the hierarchical clinical placement environment. Simultaneously, workshops for clinical mentors are recommended to inform them of the intended learning outcomes of the clinical placement and the expectations of the programs. The evidence-based effect of role modeling of clinical mentors to NSs would be emphasized in the workshops.",

Further studies using an observational design might be an alternative approach where NSs are observed objectively by an observer to determine their SPs compliance. In addition, further research should be conducted to explore the phenomena of the influence of nursing staff on NSs in the clinical settings. In addition, current studies seem to indicate that NSs have higher SPs compliance than nursing staff. After graduating from their university studies, at what point does compliance of SPs of junior nursing staff start to decline? Are they influenced by the existing senior nursing staff in the unit? What is the influence of the organizational culture? Answering these questions might shine light to establish appropriate strategies to improve the SPs compliance among nursing staff.",
