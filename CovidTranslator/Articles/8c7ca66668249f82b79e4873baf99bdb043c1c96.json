The BD MAX and InGenius system allowed use of lab-developed primers and TaqMan probes, while ARIES required conversion to MultiCode primers for melting curve analysis. Each device required \u22641 day of training and assay optimization. No discordant results were noted after analysis of 32 External Quality Control (EQC) samples. On a 10-fold dilution series of a MERS-CoV-positive EQC sample, InGenius obtained the highest detection rate. Laboratory technicians rated the ARIES as the user-friendliest. It also required the least hands-on time. BD MAX had the lowest turnaround time and highest throughput. While each device had distinguishing system properties with associated (dis)advantages, the 3 S2R systems were comparable in terms of assay development and validation.",

Due to its geographic predilection, the novel CoV was named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (de Groot et al., 2013; van Boheemen et al., 2012; Zaki et al., 2012) . Although limited in number, patients have also been reported in North Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America after returning from the Arabian Peninsula or after having contact with infected individuals. MERS-CoV is defined as a zoonotic disease as it is transmitted to humans through dromedary camels. Human-to-human transmission is observed after close contact with infected patients (e.g., in healthcare settings) (Azhar et al., 2014) .",

Ten microliters of Phocine Distemper Virus (PDV) internal control (IC) (Clancy et al., 2008) (PDV stock kindly supplied by Groningen Medical Center, Groningen, The Netherlands) is added to 200 \u03bcL UTM sample to extract and elute 110 \u03bcL of TNA. Five microliters of TNA extract is mixed with 1\u00d7 TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 0.5 \u03bcM of each primer, and 0.2 \u03bcM of each probe in a total volume of 20 \u03bcL. The MERS-CoV Fast-PCR targets 3 genes using previously described primers and probes: MERS-CoV envelope gene UpE (Corman et al., 2012) , MERS-CoV nucleocapsid gene N (Lu et al., 2014) , and PDV hemagglutinin gene H (Clancy et al., 2008) . Only the fluorescent dye combination for the MERS N gene probe was changed: Cy5-BHQ3. PCR amplification is performed on QuantStudio Dx (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the following PCR temperature profile: 10 min 50\u00b0C and 20 s 95\u00b0C followed by 45 cycles of 3 s 95\u00b0C and 30 s 60\u00b0C. After the run, amplification plots are analyzed and interpreted using QuantStudio Test Development Software (version 1.0, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The presence of MERS-CoV in the sample is defined by amplification of UpE and/or N with the PDV IC.",

Different assays can be loaded and analyzed in the same run on all systems if specific conditions are met (Table 3) . On the BD MAX and InGenius systems, PCR settings can differ between lanes as the 24 chambers in the BD MAX PCR card and 12 InGenius thermocyclers are individually controlled. Besides the ability to run different PCR assays in 1 run, the instrument \"down-time\" between analyses is important for urgent sample testing. For the InGenius system, this \"down-time\" equals the onboard extraction and PCR time (Table 3) . For BD MAX, it is limited to the extraction time as new samples can be loaded during PCR. However, the 2 independent extraction trays on the BD MAX system cannot be accessed if extraction is already ongoing in 1 of them. The ARIES system has 2 independent loading trays; if 1 module is running, the other can be used without restrictions. Information about the supplied software packages is displayed in Table 3 . On ARIES, an open mode PCR assay must be set up from the SYNCT software on a remote desktop after which the protocol is transferred to the instrument using USB (only needs to be done once). On the InGenius, the supplier must create a new open mode PCR protocol, define the assay name, and register PCR reagent volumes on the device. Afterwards, the user can modify all protocol settings. ARIES and BD MAX software allowed modification of all protocol settings without any supplier input. Lot numbers of the system-specific reagents are registered in all software packages (Table 3) . On the InGenius, the user can also add lab-developed PCR mix and IC lot numbers to the registry. Although this was not evaluated in our study, all devices can be programmed for automatic interpretation of PCR results using software models and Ct value limits (Table 3) . ARIES also accounts for dye/target Tm intervals. Determination of specific Tm intervals in the SYNCT software required us to test a number of additional positive/negative samples.",

This means that primers might have to be redesigned to exclude off-target amplicons with the same Tm. Our MERS-CoV primers only required addition of a fluorescent-labeled isoC base at the 5\u2032 end of the forward primers for conversion to the MultiCode format. As our PDV IC would have required an extra pipetting step and the development of an additional MultiCode primer, we decided to use the built-in RNA IC of the ARIES cassettes. It remained unclear whether the lower detection rate obtained with ARIES was due to MultiCode primer conversion, melting curve analysis, or limited optimization runs. It is however important to realize that due to differences in technology, MultiCode Ct values are typically higher than TaqMan Ct values (Voermans et al., 2016) . Of interest, Luminex reported the release of a new ARIES mastermix and software update in the coming months to also utilize fluorescent labeled TaqMan probes (personal communication).",

Second, the instrument \"down-time\" during analysis differs between devices and is important for urgent sample testing. Third, the ability to analyze several targets on the same sample is different for each system. The InGenius system has the advantage that a single extract (providing there is enough extract volume) can be used in 12 separate multiplex reactions (up to 6 optical channels + melting curve) in 1 run. For BD MAX, this is limited to 2 separate multiplex reactions (up to 5 optical channels + melting curve) and, for ARIES, to 1 multiplex reaction (5 optical channels + melting curve). Fourth, system-specific advantages need to be taken into account. InGenius is the only system where the remaining TNA extract can be recovered for storage or further analysis. InGenius is also the only system where the PCR volume and the added TNA volume can be increased to improve sensitivity. In comparison, BD MAX has the highest throughput and Luminex ARIES excels in ease of use. Finally, differences exist in the availability of quantitative assays. While this was not further evaluated during our study, InGenius allows definition of standard curve options for single tests/ fluorescent dyes and sample type dependent conversion factors. A standard curve can also be defined on a single test/fluorescent dye on the BD MAX. Quantitative assays have only been developed in research settings for ARIES. At the time of writing, Luminex is developing a SYNCT software update for incorporating standard curves for quantitative analysis (personal communication).",

            "text": "Although our MERS-CoV PCR assay proved both sensitive and specific on all devices, there were several limitations to the study. First, as no MERS-CoV patients were diagnosed in our center, all data were derived from EQC samples which may not be representative for clinical samples during natural infection. EQC samples were not subjected to the same collection, handling, and storage conditions as clinical samples. In addition, only 16 MERS-CoV-positive, 8 OC43-CoV-positive, 1 NL63-CoV-positive and 7 CoV-negative EQC samples were tested, which limit statistical analysis and interpretation of the cross-reaction experiments. Nevertheless, the assays on the 3 systems use the same primers/probe sets and master mix (excluding Luminex ARIES) as our lab-developed PCR on QuantStudio Dx (Clancy et al., 2008; Corman et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2014) . The specificity of this LDT was evaluated using high-titer cell cultures positive for hCOV 229E, NL63, OC43, and SARS. Clinical samples positive for other respiratory viruses, including hCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU-1, were all negative. Second, assay validation experiments were only performed once due to limited reagents and limited availability of the instruments to our laboratory. Therefore, statistically significant differences could not be determined. Especially the difference in detection rate needs to be interpreted with caution as sample composition could influence the extraction efficiency of each device. The hands-on time was measured only once by 1 operator. While this gives an overall indication on the hand-on time required for each device, our analysis does not provide insight in the real-life hands-on time (e.g., different operators, trained versus untrained personnel, day-to-day variability). Third, intra-and interrun reproducibility was not determined in our study due to limited reagents.",
