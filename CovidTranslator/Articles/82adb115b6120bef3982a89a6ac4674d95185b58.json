A strong reduction of social interactions may thus lead to R 0 < 1 when the infection dies out monotonously, or otherwise, when the reduced R 0 is still larger than unity, it leads to a reduction of the total infected fraction of the population I total = 1 \u2212 S(\u221e), and a lower peak infected fraction. A side effect of this reduction, however, is that the duration of the epidemic outbreak increases significantly. The dependence of the peak infected fraction and the time to maximum infected are shown in Fig. 1 (c). The total infected fraction at the end of the epidemic as a function of R 0 is shown in Fig. 1(d) . For example, starting with a reference value R 0 = 2.4 with time to peak infection around 65 days, reducing R 0 by factor 2 to R 0 = 1.2, extends the time to peak infection to \u223c 320 days, while reducing the maximum infected fraction from \u223c 22% to \u223c 1.5% and the total infected by the end of the epidemic decreases from \u223c 90% to \u223c 30%. Why reducing R 0 by social distancing reduces total infections and the peak infected fraction, which is critical due to the limited hospital infrastructure, (or termination of the epidemic if R 0 < 1) it has the following possible problems:",

Both sub-populations follow the SIR dynamics with the important difference that while in the majority population the infections are primarily caused by transmission within this subpopulation from infected to susceptible individuals; in the vulnerable minority the dominant route is via transmission from infected in the majority population to susceptible vulnerable.

While social distancing aims to reduce the total infected by decreasing R 0 (see continuous curve showing I total vs R 0 in Fig. 1D ), this model highlights the possibility of an alternative or complementary measure based on reducing the parameter \u00b5 by isolating/shielding the vulnerable population from infections in the majority population. This could be achieved by targeted measures providing free homedelivery of food, medication etc. combined with targeted support addressing communication and healthcare needs, support with creating separated living space where needed. Since the isolation strategy targets a small portion of the population which is less socially active and has a low participation in the economy, a radical isolation is likely to be much more efficient than uniform social distancing, with smaller cost for the economy and the functioning of the society.",

This can be linked to monitoring the progression of the infection I(t) by statistically representative testing of different regions and cities, and intensifying/relaxing the isolation of the vulnerable population accordingly. According to our model the social distancing (represented by the horizontal arrow in Fig. 1(d) ) and targeted isolation (vertical arrow in Fig. 1(d) ) could be used together in combination to reduce the overall death and hospitalisation rate. However, social distancing extends the duration of the epidemic (which may affect the sustainability of efficient isolation) and results in insufficient overall immunity of the majority population against a recurrence of the epidemic outbreak triggered by hidden or newly imported infection. On the other hand when the strategy is primarily based on drastic targeted isolation over a shorter time, the end result is a collectively immune population resistant to further infections. Therefore, when targeted isolation is implemented with high efficiency, it is preferable to avoid or apply moderate social distancing only to allow a large proportion of the majority population to become infected and develop immunity, at the cost of mostly minor symptoms similarly to a conventional flu season.",

Of course there could be a certain grey area where the separation between the two subpopulations is not always clear. In this case the separation should be determined as a usual trade-off between resources available and risk. The immunity may not be complete but from the limited information currently available on Covid-19, it appears to be fairly robust. In the absence of alternative options available the development of population level immunity could be the optimal resolution of the global pandemic at least in regions where the infection is already widespread, e.g. in Western Europe. Some countries, for example Italy and Spain, implemented severe social distancing, but so far seems to be unable to stop the progress of the epidemic and may in fact be on track towards achieving large scale immunity in the population. However, with too much focus on the implementation of uniform social distancing and no clear targeted measures for identifying and efficiently protecting the vulnerable sub-population can lead to a very dangerous scenario with high mortality in spite of the high social and economic costs of an extended and potentially recurrent epidemic.
