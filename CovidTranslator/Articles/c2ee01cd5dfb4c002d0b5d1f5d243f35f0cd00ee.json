            "text": "Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), including subtypes 2a, 2b and 2c, causes an acute enteric disease in both domestic and wild animals. Rapid and sensitive diagnosis aids effective disease management at points of need (PON). A commercially available, field-deployable and user-friendly system, designed with insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) technology, displays excellent sensitivity and specificity for nucleic acid detection. An iiPCR method was developed for on-site detection of all circulating CPV-2 strains. Limit of detection was determined using plasmid DNA. CPV-2a, 2b and 2c strains, a feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) strain, and nine canine pathogens were tested to evaluate assay specificity. Reaction sensitivity and performance were compared with an in-house real-time PCR using serial dilutions of a CPV-2b strain and 100 canine fecal clinical samples collected from 2010 to 2014, respectively. The 95% limit of detection of the iiPCR method was 13 copies of standard DNA and detection limits for CPV-2b DNA were equivalent for iiPCR and real-time PCR. The iiPCR reaction detected CPV-2a, 2b and 2c and FPV. Non-targeted pathogens were not detected. Test results of real-time PCR and iiPCR from 99 fecal samples agreed with each other, while one real-time PCR-positive sample tested negative by iiPCR. Therefore, excellent agreement (k = 0.98) with sensitivity of 98.41% and specificity of 100% in detecting CPV-2 in feces was found between the two methods. In conclusion, the iiPCR system has potential to serve as a useful tool for rapid and accurate PON, molecular detection of CPV-2.",

The most common problem in dogs between weaning and 6 months is enteritis (Houston et al., 1996; Parrish et al., 1982; Pollock and Coyne, 1993) , with clinical signs of lethargy, anorexia, vomiting and hemorrhagic diarrhea. Parvovirus also causes leukopenia, with lymphopenia and neutropenia due to infection and damage to the bone marrow (Houston et al., 1996) .

The most commonly used in-house SNAP test (IDEXX; Westbrook, MA, USA) for CPV-2 diagnosis can only detect CPV-2 in samples with >10 5 virion equivalents per milligram of feces (Decaro et al., 2010) . A sensitive test would help confirm a CPV-2 diagnosis based on clinical signs, in the absence of a positive in-house ELISA result (Decaro et al., 2010) . Situations like this, in some cases with high virus titers, have happened with significant frequency, so the recommended approach for parvovirus diagnosis is to use the in-house assay first, followed by testing with a more sensitive molecular method (such as PCR) in questionable cases (Decaro et al., 2010) . Nested PCR (Hirasawa et al., 1994) and real-time PCR (qPCR) assays (Decaro et al., 2005b) have been shown to be highly sensitive tests. However, application of nested and qPCR assays has been limited to professional laboratories due to their requirement of experienced technicians and costly equipment.",

            "text": "An on-site highly sensitive molecular test for CPV-2 diagnosis would enable appropriate quarantine and disease management of infected dogs, besides helping cut down sample shipping and processing costs and shorten test turnaround time. The newly developed convection PCR method, termed insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) (Tsai et al., 2012) , provides this capability. It utilizes a hydrolysis probe (similar to Taq-man based qPCR) and runs in a commercially available device, POCKIT TM Nucleic Acid Analyzer (POCKIT TM ; GeneReach USA, Lexington, MA, USA). The reaction mixture is automatically passed sequentially through different temperature zones in a capillary tube that is placed within the device to complete the 3 stages (denaturation, annealing, and extension) required for PCR. Optical signals produced by probe hydrolysis during the reaction are converted to S/N ratios (signal after /signal before ) by a data processing module and automatically reported as positive/negative results on a display screen. The reaction takes approximately 1 h to complete and is user-friendly enough to be run by animal shelter personnel or clinical technical staff. The device can be operated with a rechargeable battery or car battery. The small size (28 cm \u00d7 25 cm \u00d7 8.5 cm, W \u00d7 D \u00d7 H), light weight (2.1 kg), and ruggedness enable the POCKIT TM iiPCR device to be field deployable. Excellent sensitivity and specificity of iiPCR systems in detecting target pathogens from clinical samples have (Balasuriya, 2014; Balasuriya et al., 2014; Tsai et al., 2014; Wilkes et al., 2014) . In this study, taking advantage of the iiPCR system with the field-deployable POCKIT TM device, a reaction was developed to detect CPV-2 at points of need (PON). The primer/probe set was designed to target a highly conserved region within the VP2 genes of CPV-2 strains available in GenBank, based on the recommended principles for iiPCR (http://www.iipcr.com/eweb/ uploadfile/20130522114104277.pdf). The probe was labeled with a fluorescent reporter dye (6-carboxyfluorescein, FAM) at the 5 end and a minor groove binder group (MGB) with a nonfluorescent quencher at the 3 end (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The optimized iiPCR included 0.5 M forward primer, 0.5 M reverse primer, 0.05 M probe (Table 1) , 26 U of Taq DNA polymerase (BioMi, Taichung, Taiwan), and 1\u00d7 Uni-ii HS Buffer (GeneReach USA) and generated an amplicon of 111 bp. The primers, probe, dNTP, and Taq were lyophilized and rehydrated with 50 l of reconstitution buffer (GeneReach USA) before use. After mixing with 5 l of sample nucleic acid, 50 l of the mixture was transferred to a capillary R-tube TM (GeneReach USA). The tube was spun briefly in a Cubee TM mini centrifuge (GeneReach USA) and placed into the commercial iiPCR device for reaction. A lyophilized positive control (plasmid DNA), provided with the kit, was reconstituted and used for each run, and water was used as a negative control for each run. Serial dilutions of a standard plasmid DNA, which contained the target sequence, were tested in 10 or 20 repeats to evaluate detection limit of the iiPCR. Limit of detection 95% was determined to be 13 copies of standard DNA by probit analysis (Table 2) .",

To evaluate the performance of iiPCR-POCKIT TM reagent in detecting CPV-2 in fecal samples, side-by-side comparison with that of the in-house qPCR routinely used at University of Tennessee Veterinary Medical Center (UTVMC) was performed. Fecal samples were prepared by mixing with a 1:1 volume of PBS and supernatant was used for DNA extraction using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions.

Samples were amplified in a Smart Cycler II (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with an activation step for the hot start Taq polymerase at 95 \u2022 C for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 \u2022 C for 15 s, 60 \u2022 C for 30 s, and 72 \u2022 C for 30 s. Analytical sensitivity of the qPCR was determined to be 10 copies of standard plasmid DNA (data not shown). The qPCR had a linear dynamic range between 10 8 and 10 1 copies, with a slope of \u22123.4, a y-intercept of around 39, and a mean coefficient linearity (R 2 ) of 0.998. The reaction was validated internally to be more sensitive than electron microscopic detection of parvovirus and a commercially available ELISA (IDEXX) (data not shown). Analytical sensitivity of CPV-2 iiPCR in detecting viral DNA was compared to that of the reference qPCR using serial dilutions of DNA extracted from a CPV-2b clinical isolate (provided by Dr. Edward Dubovi, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA) run in triplicate. Limits of detection of iiPCR and qPCR were reached at 10 7 -and 10 6fold dilution, respectively, indicating that the established reaction had sensitivity equivalent to, if not better than, that of the qPCR (Table 3) . Furthermore, to assess the specificity of the CPV-2 iiPCR, one subtype 2a isolate (provided by Dr. Jeremiah T. Saliki, Athens Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA), four subtype 2b, and three 2c samples, identified previously by sequencing analysis, were tested. Positive results were obtained from all eight samples, demonstrating that the reagent could detect all current CPV subtypes. The iiPCR reagent could also detect feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), a close relative of CPV-2. Furthermore, an exclusivity panel including nine important canine pathogens (canine adenovirus 2, canine herpesvirus, canine parainfluenza virus, canine enteric coronavirus, canine distemper virus, Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimuruim and Dublin, Clostridium perfringens with tox A gene, and Cryptosporidium canis) were analyzed. All of them generated negative results with iiPCR, indicating excellent specificity of the established assay.",
