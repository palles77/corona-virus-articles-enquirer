The escalating research to fight against cancer is getting us closer to a future, where cancer becomes a curable disease. As a researcher, we dream of curing cancer as easy as the deadly diseases viz., chickenpox, smallpox, polio, measles, sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), yellow fever, malaria etc., [1] . Although existing drugs show efficacy, their lack of selectivity for tumor cells over normal cells can lead to severe side effects [2] . Cancer is caused by mutations that transform healthy cells into tumor cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that there will not be a match between tumors of two patients. It implies that the scientists should work on medicines that are tailored to cure a specific patient.",

Ligand 1 (L 1 H) shows [M+2] + peak at m/z 374. Similarly, L 2 H shows [M+1] + peak at m/z 399. Electrospray ionization mass spectral (ESI-MS) study of metal complexes supports 1 : 2 [(ML) 2 ] stoichiometry. Cu(L 1 ) 2 complex show [M-2] + peak at m/z 803; whereas Cu(L 2 ) 2 complex show [M-1] + peak at m/z 856. Similar observations are madefor nickel and cobalt complexes as well. The mass spectral data is matching very well with the predicted molecular weights of the compounds and this confirms the formation of metal complexes in each case[33,34]. The mass spectra of nickel and cobalt complexes are reproduced in spectrum 13 to 16 of supplementary material.",

The d-d transitions are recorded in concentrated solutions of metal complexes prepared in DMF. The free ligands absorb strongly at 350 and 348 nm (in L 1 H and L 2 H respectively) due to \u03c0 \u03c0* transitions. These bands have remained almost unchanged upon complexation. The bands at 415 nm (in L 1 H) and 410 nm (in L 2 H) are ascribed to n \u03c0* transitions associated with carbonyl groups and hydrazone (C=N) group. These bands have suffered bathochromic (red) shift in all the cases upon complex formation due to the donation of charge density to the metal ion for the coordination. This confirms that, the nitrogen atom of hydrazone group, the oxygens of amide and carboxylic acid group are involved in the bond formation. IR spectra of the metal complexes support the observations made from electronic spectral studies. Intra-molecular charge transfer bands are seen at 440 nm (in L 1 H) and 436 nm (in L 2 H) [35]. These bands have shifted to lower wavelengths (hypsochromic shift) upon complexation, indicating that charge density is transferred from metal to ligand.The absorption spectrum of Cu(L 1 ) 2 and Cu(L 2 ) 2 complexes (spectrum 18 and 19",

In humans, six anti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family have been reported, including BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL-1, BCL-W, BFL-1 and BCL-B [46]. Hence, in the present study, BCL-XL was taken as receptor molecule for docking to study the anticancer potential of newly synthesized ligands and their metal complexes. In the present study active sites of several amino acids were included in the docking study. The selected metal complexes and ligands have shown appreciating anticancer activity through docking within active sites of BCL-XL consisting of Phe97(A), Arg102(A), Phe105(A), Ser106(A), Leu108(A), Glu129(A), Leu130(A), Asn136(A), Gly138(A), Arg139(A), Ala93(B), Phe97(B), Tyr101(B), Ala104(B), Phe105(B), Gly138(B) and Tyr195(B) amino acid residues. The selected compounds were successfully docked and studied for type of interactions with receptor protein like electrostatic interactions, binding energy and other parameters. Furthermore, molecular docking studies have shown that selected complexes were having strong binding affinity with BCL-XL and also acting as strong BCL-XL inhibitor. The obtained docking result showed a good correlation between in vitro anticancer activity and binding free energy of selected compounds. Grid setting is shown in Fig. 10 whereas, the docked view of ligands L 1 H and L 2 H with BCL-XL protein is shown in Figs. 11 and 12 respectively.
