We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of Human Rhinovirus (HRV) infection in the acute attack of wheezy chest which began after a respiratory illness. Methodology: The study was conducted on 200 children aged 2 months to 5 years presenting to the emergency department with an acute wheezy episode either for the first time or recurrent wheeze defined as >2 reports of wheezing in the first 3 years of life. All subjects were subjected to a complete history and clinical examination. Chest X-ray was done to all subjects. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from all subjects and the presence of HRV was determined by PCR examination. Results: By PCR method, 163 patients (81.5%) were positive for viral infection. Due to viral co-infection, 49.5% (99 cases) were +ve for Respiratory Syncytial virus followed by HRV 43.5% (87 cases). Conclusion: HRV was the second common viral infection in children with wheezes. Its prevalence was more in winter with higher incidence of recurrence. Compared to the other respiratory viruses, it had the higher mortality 43.7%.",

            "text": "Asthma is a heterogeneous and multi-factorial disease that manifests as episodes of coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath mainly at night. 1 The major pathophysiology of asthma is bronchial inflammation with airway hyper-responsiveness, which results in reversible airway obstruction. 2 Among the various factors that have been involved in the pathogenesis of asthma, viral infections are the most prominent. Viral infection affects wheezing and asthma in children and adults of all ages. Wheezing illnesses are usually viral in origin, and children with more severe wheezing episodes are more likely to develop asthma later on in their life. 3 Human rhinoviruses (HRV) are not only the main pathogens responsible for the common cold, but are also now recognized to have a major impact on asthma pathogenesis. Children who experience repeated rhinovirus-induced wheezing episodes in infancy have a significantly increased risk of developing asthma, even when compared to children who experience wheezing induced by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). 4 The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of Human Rhinovirus as a cause of acute wheezing in Egyptian children after an acute respiratory illness.",

In our study, we had almost the same viruses isolated from wheezy infants and children but RSV was most common, followed by HRV then Adenovirus. 6 Another study done on 626 hospitalized children admitted with acute expiratory wheezes, viruses were detected in the nasopharyngeal aspirates by PCR. A viral pathogen was identified in 444 (71%). RSV was the most frequently detected (27%), followed by rhinovirus (24%). 7 In our study, HRV +ve cases represented with recurrent attacks of wheezes rather than single attack. HRVs have been recognized as an extremely common cause of recurrent wheezing in early childhood by Message and his colleagues, 2008. 8 HRV infection was associated with a 10-fold risk of developing asthma. 9 Among rhinovirus positive patients, co-infection with more than one virus was (83.5%, 79 cases) than infection with single virus (16.5%, 8 cases). Fujitsuks and his colleagues 2011, had co-infection detected in 14 (12.2%) patients while, Smuts and his colleagues 2011, it was 16%. 10, 11 Interestingly, our study comes in agreement with a study done by Feng and his colleagues, 2012 which was performed on 1335 nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from children hospitalized for acute lower respiratory tract infection. Approximately 30% were confirmed as HRV-positive cases with 45% confirmed as RSVpositive cases. This study shows also that HRV infection occurs sporadically throughout the year with an HRV-positive rate higher in winter and autumn. 12 All our HRV +ve cases were admitted to PICU and this could be explained by the presence of bacterial super-infection. This comes in agreement with a study done by Guittet and colleagues 2003. The results showed that 11.9% of patients with rhinovirus showed pneumonia and 40% of them showed abnormal chest X-ray in the form of increased bronchovascular markings, consolidation, pneumothorax and pleural effusion. 5 Conclusion HRV was the second common viral infection in children with wheezes. Its prevalence was more in winter with higher incidence of recurrence. Compared to the other respiratory viruses, it had the higher mortality 43.7%.",
