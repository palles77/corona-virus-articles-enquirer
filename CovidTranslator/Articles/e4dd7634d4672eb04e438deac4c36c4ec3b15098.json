            "text": "Sho-saiko-to (SST) was introduced into Japan as an oriental classical medicine from China approximately 1500 years ago, and it is currently the most representative Kampo medicine (traditional Japanese medicine). SST is manufactured in Japan as an ethical drug on a modern industrial scale in which the quality of ingredients is standardized with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) regulation. SST is widely used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis. Experimental and clinical studies including multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies have demonstrated the various pharmacological effects of SST. SST is prepared from the hot water extraction of seven raw materials, therefore many kinds of constituents are included. Three-dimensional (3D) HPLC analysis is useful for obtaining many kinds of constituents, especially low molecular ultraviolet (UV) quenching compounds, contained in SST as well as its fractions. Fingerprint pattern provided by 3D HPLC analysis makes possible to identify the overall-viewing of SST. Databases of UV spectra of the components of medicinal herbs obtained by reversed-phase (RP) HPLC using a photodiode array (PDA) and fingerprint patterns of crude drugs made by 3D HPLC analysis facilitate the identification, analysis and quality of herbal drugs. Studies using both PDA HPLC and an amino acid analysis with a fluorometric detector have found that SST contains fifteen major low molecular compounds (i.e. baicalin, wogonin-7-O-glucuronide, liquiritin, their three aglycons, liquiritin apioside, glycyrrhizin, saikosaponin b1, saikosaponin b2, ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Rb1, (6)-gingerol, (6)-shogaol and arginine). These compounds have various pharmacological actions, and are assumed to be responsible, at least partly, for the pharmacological effects of SST. Although there have only been a few investigations on high molecular compounds with pharmacological actions contained in SST, several kinds of polysaccharides have been isolated from constituent herbs of SST. This review paper summarizes analytical methods of separation, isolation and identification of compounds with biological activities from SST, which is a mixture drug of medicinal herbs. Accordingly, this paper would not focus on methods of separation, isolation and analysis of particular compounds from each constituent herb of SST.",

            "text": "\"Kampo\" medicine is a Japanese traditional medicine that had developed from the traditional herbal medicine originating in ancient China [1] . The primary mode of Kampo therapy is ingestion of Kampo formulas (i.e. specific combinations of raw herbs) written in classical texts, which are assumed to represent the culmination of empirical knowledge gained over the centuries. Chinese traditional medicine and Kampo medicine vastly differ from Western medicine, and even from Western herbal medicines, with regard to many points, for example, in philosophy, in the concepts of diseases, and in the therapeutic approach. Among the differences, in Chinese traditional medicine and Kampo medicine, herbs are generally used in combinations. The use of a single herb is exceptional. As a rule, herbs are mixed and then extracted with hot water. Some Kampo formulas contain herbs with similar pharmacological activity. Other Kampo formulas contain herbs with different, sometimes even conflicting, pharmacological properties. Many Kampo formulas with different properties and different indication of drug treatment contain common herbs such as Glycyrrhizae Radix. The unique strategy adopted by these oriental medicines is the use of the mixture of various medical herbs with pharmacologically active compounds that have additive and/or synergistic effects or reduce the harmful activities of some pharmacologically active compounds. The benefit of the strategy, however, is to be proved in the future, at least in terms of modern medical science. The combinatorial nature of Chinese traditional medicine and Kampo medicine makes it extremely difficult to identify the active compounds and to elucidate the mechanism of their pharmacological actions. There are an enormous number of compounds in a single Kampo formula, and the amount of each compound is minute. A single Kampo formula may contain different ingredients with similar bioactivity or similar ingredients with different, even antagonistic, bioactivity. Further, many compounds are commonly present in many different Kampo formulae that are used for the treatment of quite different diseases.",

Some of them have been demonstrated to have clinical therapeutic efficacy in contemporary scientific research studies including multi-center, placebo-controlled, doubleblind studies. Over one hundred Kampo formulas have been approved as ethical drugs by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Labor of Japan, and are clinically used for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases. It has been reported that over the 80% of physicians in Japan who have been educated in Western medicine at Japanese medical schools have some experience in using Kampo medicines ethically [2] . Therefore, in Japan, the isolation, identification and analysis of the active compounds in Kampo formulas are not only a method for investigation of candidates for new drug development from an extraordinarily rich source, but also a method that is necessary for quality control and for elucidation of the pharmacological mechanisms of actions of the drugs now in use.",

Long-term administration of SST has been used to treat approximately one million patients with chronic viral liver diseases, in order to improve liver dysfunction and to prevent the progression to liver fibrosis and carcinogenesis [3] . SST is a spray-or freeze-dried extract and consists of seven medicinal herbs. Phytochemical analysis of SST and modern scientific studies on its pharmacological actions were commenced about 30 years ago. Several clinical studies have demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of SST in patients with chronic viral hepatitis [4, 5] . Many experimental reports have demonstrated the pharmacological actions of SST. SST has anti-inflammatory [6] [7] [8] [9] , immunomodulating [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , and anti-oxidant effects [18] [19] [20] [21] , and it inhibits the progression or worsening of hepatic fibrosis [22] [23] [24] , hepatitis [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] , tumors [30] [31] [32] [33] , gastric injury [34] , lung injury [35, 36] and HIV proliferation/activity [37] [38] [39] . However, although many compounds with biological activities have been isolated and identified from the constituent herbs of SST, the active compounds responsible for each effect of SST described above have not been elucidated.",

However, in recent years, technological advances have made it possible to manufacture the extract as a spray-or a freeze-dried powder with high standards of quality, uniformity and stability. SST consists of the powder extracted by hot water from the mixture of seven medical herbs that are registered in the Pharmacopoeia of Japan [40] . SST is currently prepared as follows. A mixture of 7.0 g of Radix of Bupleurum falcatum (Bupleurum Radix), 5.0 g of Tuber of Pinellia ternate (Pinelliae Tuber), 3.0 g of Radix of Scutellaria baicalensis (Scutellariae Radix), 3.0 g of Fructus of Zizyphus jujube (Zizyphi Fructus), 3.0 g of Radix of Panax ginseng (Ginseng Radix), 2.0 g of Radix of some species of Glycyrrhiza (i.e. uralensis, inflata or glabra) (Glycyrrhizae Radix), and 1.0 g of Rhizoma of Zingiber officinale (Zingiberis Rhizoma), in 10-fold weight of water is boiled for 60 min and filtered; then, the extract fluid is dried to obtain the extracted powder. Presently, Kampo medicines such as SST are manufactured according to the Ethical Kampo Medicine Drug GMP regulation and the self-imposed regulations of the Japan Kampo-Medicine Manufacturers Association.

The different classes of compounds present in the most widely used SST product (TJ-9, Tsumura & Co., Tokyo, Japan) are shown in Table 1 . All manufacturers of Kampo medicines as ethical drugs in Japan ensure that their extracts contain two or more of the major compounds that characterize the particular medicine group and that their extracts meet the criteria for a large number of other parameters. Chemical studies for investigation of the constituent compounds in Kampo medicines including SST or its component herbs, have generally been performed by HPLC analysis [41] [42] [43] . In recent years, HPLC combined with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) [44] or mass spectrometry (MS) [45] has been used to identify compounds in various herbs. These methods are powerful tools, especially when used to analyze certain types of compounds. However, in order to obtain an overall-viewing of as many compounds in a Kampo formula as possible at a glance, a PDA detector or an evaporative light scattering (ELS) detector is superior because Kampo medicines and herbs contain many classes of compounds with different physicochemical properties. In order to confirm the presence of many compounds qualitatively, analysis by gradient RP-HPLC is generally performed.",

However, it is difficult to detect many of these compounds in SST directly because: (1) SST is a mixture of seven medicinal herbs and therefore may contain a greater number of kinds of compounds in much smaller quantities than in each constituent herb; (2) SST is a hot water decoction and therefore the efficiency and profile of the extracted compounds are very different from those of the compounds extracted by an organic solvent from each herb; (3) the extraction of compounds with hot water often transforms the compounds to many different structures; (4) the presence of multiple herbs during the extraction process usually alters the profiles of the extracted (2) Ginsenan PB (3) Ginsenoside Rb2",

Analysis based on ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption showed that BA was the dominant compound and that GL and SSb2 were barely detectable (Fig. 1B) , indicating that detection based on UV-vis absorption is less sensitive than ELS detection. However, when 3D HPLC analysis was used, data on the retention time and the UV-vis profile were obtained simultaneously. When the data on retention time and the UV-vis spectrum are integrated, it is easier to assign each peak by referring to the peaks of known compounds.

The UV-vis spectral curves of three points (head, top and tail) in each peak and the retention time were compared with those of authentic samples. The similarity of spectra was processed and calculated by the Shimadzu CLASS-LC10 processor and the pre-established UV-vis profiles of BA, GL and SSb2 (Fig. 1C) , we can assign the peaks corresponding to BA, GL and SSb2 in the 3D HPLC analysis chart. We have been constructing a database that includes the retention times, the UV-vis profiles of approximately 1000 compounds purified from various herbs, and more than 100 fingerprint patterns of Kampo medicines and constituent herbs made by 3D HPLC analysis. The database will enable us to provide not only a convenient method of assigning the constituent compounds contained in herbs and Kampo medicines, but also the means to control the quality of the extracts from a more comprehensive and global viewpoint by providing the \"fingerprint\" of each medicine/herb. In the following sections that describe methods of separation and isolation of various compounds with pharmacological actions (Fig. 2) , the 3D HPLC analysis profiles of various fractions separated from SST will be shown to provide an overall-viewing of the fractions.",

Several methods have been developed to remove HMC from Kampo medicines [17, 49] , and the method that is frequently used is as follows. SST is first dissolved in 10-fold weight of water and then ethanol is gradually added to its final concentration of 80% (v/v) aqueous ethanol. After centrifugation at 1400 \u00d7 g at room temperature for 20 min, the precipitate (P-fraction) and the supernatant (S-fraction) are each evaporated to dryness. The yield of P-or S-fraction is typically ca. 41.3 and 50.2%, respectively. To analyze the LMC in the S-fraction in detail, the S-fraction is subjected to further separation procedures as described in the following Sections 3.2, 4.1.1, 4.2.1, 4.3.1 and 4.4.1 according to their physicochemical properties (Fig. 2) . Other investigators have developed methods of isolating polysaccharides with pharmacological activities from the P-fraction or from the constituent herbs of SST, which will be described in Section 5.1.",

GL and GA have a wide variety of pharmacological effects, including hepatoprotective [89, 90] , immunomodulatory [91] [92] [93] , anti-inflammatory [94, 95] , anti-mutagenic [96, 97] and antiulcer effects [98] . Inhibitory effect of GL on HIV- [99] and SARS-associated coronavirus [100] has been also reported. Upon oral administration of SST, SSa and SSd in the SST extract are transformed to SSb1 and SSb2, respectively, by hydrolysis by the gastric juice [101] . Although SSb1 and SSb2 have not been directly demonstrated to have pharmacological activities, oral administration of SSa and SSd had an anti-granulomatous effect in a cotton pellet-induced granulomatous model [102] , and intraperitoneal administration of SSb1 and SSb2 increased the plasma adrenocorticotropin and corticosterone levels in animal models [103, 104] . These reports suggested that SSb1 and SSb2 have an anti-inflammatory property. The detectable peaks of GSRb1 and GSRg1 were rather small as shown in Fig. 6 , however, these compounds were demonstrated to have multiple, potent, pharmacological actions even in trace amounts [105, 106] . GSRg1 was demonstrated to increase the number of helper T cells, induce mitogenic activity of T cells by augmentation of IL-1 production [107] , enhance expression of the IL-2 receptor \u2423 chain, increase intracellular levels of cAMP and cGMP in vitro [108] , and inhibit the release of soluble IL-2 receptor [109] .",

Several authors have reported that macromolecules with pharmacological activities have been isolated from the constituent herbs of SST (i.e., Zizyphi Fructus, Bupleurum Radix, Ginseng Radix and Pinelliae Tuber) [124, 125] , there have only been a few studies on identification of the macromolecules. Yamaoka et al. [17] isolated and determined the composition of the sugar moiety in the fraction consisting of pure acid polysaccharide which can augment natural killer (NK) activity from SST, although its structure has not been determined yet. This fraction was prepared by extraction with nbutanol, precipitation by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and DEAE-Sephadex column chromatography. As a result, a polysaccharide fraction (fraction 12) with the chemical properties shown in Table 8 was separated from SST. From several SST constituent herbs (i.e., Bupleurum Radix, Pinelliae Tuber and Ginseng Radix), Yamada and coworkers [126] [127] [128] purified and determined the sugar compositions and, in some cases, the structures of the polysaccharides that have antiulcer or anti-complementary effects, that promote B cells proliferation and/or that induce the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins. For example, the crude polysaccharide fraction that had been prepared by hot-water extraction and ethanol precipitation from Bupleurum Radix, was fractionated by treatment with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide into four polysaccharide fractions. The most acidic fraction was further fractionated on DEAE-Sepharose column chromatography by stepwise elution with NH 4 HCO 3 to bupleuran 2IIb, c, d, and e. Bupleuran 2IIb and c are each a homogenous pectin-like polysaccharide consisting of a large polygalacturonan region and a small rhamnogalacturonan region. Structural characterization of these polysac- charides has been performed by gel filtration, HPLC and electrophoresis, NMR studies, methylation analysis before and after reduction of carboxyls, Smith degradation, digestion with endo-polygalacturonase, base-catalyzed betaelimination, enzymatic hydrolysis, etc. Ginsenan PA and PB have been isolated and characterized by similar procedures [129] .",

Many clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated the various pharmacological effects of SST. SST, a hot water extract of the mixture of seven medical herbs, is assumed to contain many LMC and HMC, and both groups of compounds have been demonstrated to have important pharmacological activities [49] . Phytochemical analysis of the LMC in the constituent herbs of SST has been performed by a number of investigators, and many LMC have been isolated, characterized, and proven to have biological activities. HMC, typically polysaccharides, have also been isolated and characterized, and their pharmacological activities were demonstrated, although there have only been a few studies on HMC. Nevertheless, the possible contributions of the above-mentioned compounds to the various pharmacological effects of SST remain to be clarified. The combinatorial use of multiple herbs and extraction by hot water, which are characteristics of Kampo medicines, make phytochemical and pharmacological analyses of SST extremely difficult. In addition, because Kampo medicines are manufactured as highly standardized ethical drugs in Japan, a method of comprehensive analysis of the compounds for scientific quality control is urgently needed.",

            "text": "The methods of phytochemical analysis for the separation/detection of low and high molecular weight compounds in SST that are assumed to be the active principles in SST, are summarized as follows. Upon sedimentation with 80% ethanol, the S fraction (enriched with low molecular weight compounds) and P fraction (enriched with high molecular weight compounds) are separated. The S fraction is subsequently separated into five fractions (i.e., W, 50M, Mflavonoids, M-saponins, and MS-pa). Each fraction contains various compounds that are detected by PDA-HPLC analysis or by an automatic amino acid analyzer. Three-dimensional HPLC analysis is useful for obtaining the overall-viewing of the many LMC contained in SST and/or its fractions at a glance. Databases containing UV-vis profiles of herbal compounds obtained by RP-HPLC and fingerprint patterns of crude drugs made by 3D HPLC analysis to facilitate identification and qualification of the herbal drugs, are growing. BA, WGG, OAG, BE, WG, OA, LQ, LA, ILQ, ILA, LG (flavonoids), GL, SSb1, SSb2, GSRg1, GSRb1 (triterpene saponins), (6)-gingerol, (6)-shogaol (phenylalkanoids) and arginine (an amino acid) have been detected in these fractions from SST (Table 10) . Among them, fifteen compounds (i.e., BA, WGG, BE, WG, LA, LQ, LG, GL, SSb1, SSb2, GSRg1, GSRb1, (6)-gingerol, (6)-shogaol and arginine) have been reported to have various pharmacological effects, which are assumed to be related to the pharmacological effects of SST. The structures of several high molecular polysaccharides with pharmacological activities that were isolated from the constituent herbs of SST (i.e., Bupleurum Radex, Zizyphi Fructus and Ginseng Radix), have been determined (Table 9 ), although only a few studies on the high molecular bioactive materials in herbs have been reported.",
