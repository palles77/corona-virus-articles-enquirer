            "text": "Combined with test results for other viral pathogens reported previously in the same patients, 1 the detection of hMPV in our current analysis increased the overall prevalence of viral infections among the wheezing subjects younger than 3 years to almost 90%. These results confirm and strengthen the observation that viral respiratory tract pathogens are the dominant risk factor for wheezing exacerbations in early childhood. Similar to other viruses that are significantly associated with wheezing during early childhood, more information is needed about the infants who are infected with hMPV and their long-term prognosis with respect to persistent wheezing and their risk for developing asthma. 8 * These subjects also tested positive for other viruses, including parainfluenza virus (subject 1); cytomegalovirus (subject 2); adenovirus, RSV, cytomegalovirus, and parainfluenza virus (subject 5); and rhinovirus and parainfluenza virus (subject 11).",
