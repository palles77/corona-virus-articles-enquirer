            "text": "Trichothecenes are exquisitely toxic to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and leukocytes and thus are likely to impair gut immunity. The purpose of this research was to test the hypothesis that the Type A trichothecene T-2 toxin interferes with the gut mucosal immune response to enteric reovirus infection. Mice were exposed i.p. first to 1.75 mg/kg bw T-2 and then 2 h later with 3 \u00d7 10 7 plaque-forming units of reovirus serotype 1, strain Lang (T1/L). As compared to vehicle-treated control, T-2-treated mice had dramatically elevated intestinal plaque-forming viral titers after 5 days and failed to completely clear the virus from intestine by 10 days. Levels of reovirus \u03bb2 core spike (L2 gene) RNA in feces in T-2-treated mice were significantly higher at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days than controls. T-2 potentiated L2 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner with as little as 50 \u03bcg/kg of the toxin having a potentiative effect. T-2 exposure transiently suppressed induction of reovirus-specific IgA in feces (6 and 8 days) as well as specific IgA and IgG 2a in serum (5 days). This suppression corresponded to decreased secretion of reovirus-specific IgA and IgG 2a in Peyer's patch (PP) and lamina propria fragment cultures prepared 5 days after infection. T-2 suppressed IFN-\u03b3 responses in PP to reovirus at 3 and 7 days as compared to infected controls whereas IL-2 mRNA concentrations were unaffected. PP IL-6 mRNA levels were increased 2-fold 2 h after T-2 treatment, but no differences between infected T-2-exposed and infected vehicle-treated mice were detectable over the next 7 days. Overall, the results suggest that T-2 toxin increased both the extent of GI tract reovirus infection and fecal shedding which corresponded to both suppressed immunoglobulin and IFN-\u03b3 responses.",

Although Type B trichothecenes, notably deoxynivalenol (DON), are most commonly encountered (Pestka and Smolinski, 2005) , the more highly toxic Type A trichothecenes are also sometimes detectable (Schothorst and van Egmond, 2004) . Type A trichothecenes have nearly 10 to 100 times greater toxicity in animal and in vitro models than the Type B group with T-2 toxin being of most concern (Ueno, 1984) . T-2 is considered to be the principal etiologic agent in outbreaks of fatal human alimentary toxic aleukia (ATA) with clinical signs of this disease being gastrointestinal (GI) tract hemorrhage, bone marrow depletion, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, and sepsis (Joffe, 1978) . This etiologic linkage is supported by studies in experimental animals (Lutsky et al., 1978) .",

In rodents, both i.p. and oral exposure to the toxin induces apoptosis of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, including bone marrow, Peyer's patches, spleen, and thymus (Ihara et al., 1997; Shinozuka et al., 1997a Shinozuka et al., , 1997b Islam et al., 1998; Nagata et al., 2001) . Experimental animals similarly treated with T-2 are more susceptible to systemic infections by Salmonella Typhimurium (Tai and Pestka, 1990; Ziprin and Elissalde, 1990; Kubena et al., 2001) , Listeria monocytogenes (Ziprin and McMurray, 1988; Ziprin et al., 1987) , Babesia microti (Corrier and Wagner, 1988) , Mycobacterium (Kanai and Kondo, 1984; Ziprin and McMurray, 1988) , and Herpes simplex virus (Friend et al., 1983) . Although the intestine is a principal target in ATA, little is known of T-2\u2032s capacity to suppress the gut mucosal immune response. Assessment of potential xenobiotic modulation of mucosal immune function has lagged behind wellestablished methods for measuring systemic immunotoxicity (Kawabata et al., 1995; Bondy and Pestka, 2005) . In one exception, Cuff et al. (1998) successfully used enteric reovirus (respiratory enteric orphan virus) to assess the suppressive effects of cyclophosphamide on gastrointestinal immune system suggesting that this virus is a valuable model for investigating mucosal immunotoxicity.",

These effects correlated with suppressed Th1 and enhanced Th2 cytokine responses, respectively. The threshold for suppression by DON was 2 mg/kg bw. Given the greater reported toxicity of T-2 over DON (Ueno, 1984) and the inherent differences in the capacity of these two mycotoxins to modulate cytokine gene expression (Ouyang et al., 1995) , exposure to even very low concentrations of T-2 might pose a significant hazard to human GI immune function. Here, we tested the hypothesis that T-2 interferes with the gut mucosal immune response to experimental enteric reovirus infection in the mouse. The results suggest that T-2 increased both the extent of GI tract reovirus infection and fecal shedding with as little as 50 \u03bcg/kg of the toxin being suppressive. Impaired gut resistance to reovirus by T-2 corresponded to suppressed immunoglobulin and IFN-\u03b3 responses.",

To assess mucosal IgA responses, reovirus-specific IgA in feces was compared over the 10 days course of infection in vehicle-and T-2-treated mice. Increased reovirus-specific IgA was detectable 6, 8, and 10 days after reovirus infection in vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 4) . Induction of reovirus-specific IgA was significantly suppressed at 6 and 8 days in feces from T-2-treated mice (P b 0.05). Impaired IgA responses corresponded to suppression of reovirus-specific IgA secretion in fragment cultures of LP (Fig. 5A) and PP (Fig. 5B ) obtained from T-2-treated mice 5 days after infection (P b 0.05).

Treatment with T-2 for 2 h without reovirus initially elevated IFN-\u03b3 ( Fig.  8A ) but suppressed IL-2 ( Fig. 8B ) mRNA levels. Reovirus markedly induced IFN-\u03b3 mRNA expression from 3 to 7 days but this was suppressed by T-2 (Fig. 8A) . Reovirus also caused decreases in IL-2 (Fig. 8B ) and IL-4 ( Fig. 9A ) mRNA which were not impacted by T-2. IL-6 mRNA was initially elevated by treatment with T-2 for 2 h without reovirus but did not differ from vehicle-treated controls during the course of reovirus infection (Fig. 9B) . Reovirus caused decreases in IL-10 mRNA but this effect was abrogated by T-2 treatment (Fig. 8C) .

Reovirus has widely been used to study viral pathogenesis (Tyler et al., 2001) and previous studies suggest this virus to be a robust model for monitoring dysregulation of host resistance in the gut mucosal immune system. Here, a single T-2 exposure was found to suppress the host response to reovirus as evidenced by the inability to clear the virus from intestine as well as by increased fecal shedding of the virus. Rosen et al. (1960) described an outbreak of T1 reovirus infection among children over a 9-week period. Fecal shedding of the virus occurred for at least 1 week in 54% of the children and lasted at least 2 weeks in an additional 21%. All children with detectable virus in their stools exhibited elevated antibody titers to the virus. Thus, the Fig. 7 . Ex vivo production of reovirus-specific IgG 2a is suppressed in spleen and PP cultures of T-2-treated mice. Mice were treated with 0 or 1.75 mg/kg of T-2 i.p. and then 2 h later and then orally infected with 3 \u00d7 10 7 PFU of reovirus. Spleen and PP fragment cultures were incubated for 5 days without additional stimulation. Reovirus-specific IgG 2A of cultured supernatants were determined by ELISA. Data are means \u00b1 SEM (n = 9). Bars marked with an asterisk are significantly different from corresponding infected control given vehicle at same time point (P b 0.05). After 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days, Peyer's patches (PP) RNAs were isolated and relative expression of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 mRNA measured by real-time PCR. Data are means \u00b1 SEM (n = 6). Asterisk indicates significant difference from corresponding infected control given vehicle (P b 0.05). murine model employed in this study appears to be relevant to human infection from the perspectives of both gut infection kinetics and seroconversion.",

This dose is approximately equivalent to a daily consumption of 350 \u03bcg/kg T-2 in mouse diet. In relation, reported T-2 concentrations in European wheat, maize, barley, and oats have been reported to be as much as 250, 260, 310, and 530 \u03bcg/kg (Canady et al., 2001) . The LOEL observed herein for the mouse reovirus model was consistent with findings of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) who identified the lowest observed effect level of 29 \u03bcg/kg bw per day based on changes in white and red blood cell counts identified in a 3week dietary study in pigs (Canady et al., 2001) . JECFA used this LOEL and a safety factor of 500 to derive a provisional maximal tolerable daily intake for T-2 of 60 ng/kg bw per day. It should be further noted that we utilized i.p. exposure in this study to minimize experimental variation. While T-2 distributes rapidly to lymphoid tissue regardless of exposure route (Canady et al., 2001) , it will nevertheless be critical to understand how acute and chronic exposure by ingestion to low concentrations of T-2 might impact host resistance to reovirus.",

            "text": "The specific mechanisms by which T-2 suppresses Ig and IFN-\u03b3 response are unclear but might be explainable by selective leukocyte death in the mucosal or systemic compartments. Exposure to T-2 has been previously shown to induce apoptotic cell death in PP, thymus, spleen, or bone marrow (Shinozuka et al., 1997a (Shinozuka et al., , 1997b Nagata et al., 2001) . Notably, Islam et al. (1998) found that within 6 h after i.p. injection with T-2 doses as low as 0.87 mg/kg, marked DNA fragmentation is observed in the thymus. Using flow cytometry, these investigators further determined that when compared with vehicle controls, CD4 + CD8 + double positive subsets were decreased significantly at 24, 48, and 72 h in thymuses of mice treated with 1.75 mg/kg T-2. Furthermore, a significant decrease in CD4 + CD8 \u2212 thymocytes was also observed at 72 h after T-2 exposure. Nagata et al. (2001) found similar effects in thymus mice orally exposed to T-2 and that these effects extended into the PP. Attenuation in CD4 + CD8 + and CD4 + CD8 \u2212 cell could conceivably impact Fig. 9 . Kinetics of Th2 cytokine mRNA expression in Peyer's patches of T-2treated mice. Mice were treated with vehicle (closed circles) or T-2 (open circles) as described in Fig. 8 and relative expression of IL-6, IL-10, and IL-4 mRNA determined by real-time PCR. Data are means \u00b1 SEM (n = 6). Asterisk indicates significant difference from corresponding infected control given vehicle (P b 0.05). requisite T helper activity for mounting both IgA and IgG responses. Similarly, alterations in these populations might also contribute to decreased production of IFN-\u03b3. In support of this contention, we previously observed that in vivo DON exposure suppresses reovirus-induced IFN-\u03b3 secretion by CD4 + cells in PP cultures . Additional analysis of the relationship among T-2 dose, differential leukocyte cell death, and suppressed reovirus responses is warranted.",

            "text": "T-2\u2032s effects on mucosal immune response to reovirus differed in several respects from that observed previously for DON . Much lower doses of T-2 (0.05 to 1.75 mg/kg) than DON (2 to 25 mg/kg) impaired reovirus clearance. Furthermore, 10 days after treatment with T-2 at the highest dose, a large amount of residual virus remained in the intestine whereas it was completely cleared in mice at the highest DON dose. Thus, less efficient clearance after T-2 exposure might relate to suppression of the mucosal IgA response. While DON similarly impaired reovirus-induced IFN\u03b3 and attenuated early mucosal and systemic IgA and IgG responses (1 to 5 days), it later potentiated reovirus-specific IgA in feces, serum, and fragment cultures during later stages of the infection (5 to 10 days). DON-exposed mice also exhibited markedly increased IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 mRNA expression in PP which was suggestive of a skewed Th2 response. All three of these cytokines promote proliferation and terminal differentiation of Ig-secreting cells as well as downregulate Th1 responses (Yamamoto et al., 1996; Diehl and Rincon, 2002; Conti et al., 2003; Mathers and Cuff, 2004) . The lack of a similarly robust effect on Th 2 cytokines by T-2 suggests inherent differences between these two toxins (and perhaps Type A and Type B trichothecenes) in their capacity to upregulate cytokines during viral infection and might explain the lack of IgA enhancing effect.",

Elevated viral load in intestinal tissue is likely to increase inflammation and discomfort to the host during the infection process. Additionally, increased fecal shedding could enhance virus dissemination among individuals. While reovirus was used here primarily as a model, its pathogenic mechanisms and resultant host immune responses are shared with many enteric and respiratory viruses (Nibert et al., 1996) . It might be speculated that trichothecene exposure could enable more virulent viruses to establish infections and cause serious diseases. Intriguingly, reovirus T1/L has been found to evoke acute respiratory distress in young mice (Majeski et al., 2003a (Majeski et al., , 2003b London et al., 2002) . A human reovirus isolated from a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patient has been recently demonstrated to cause SARS-like symptoms in macaques and guinea pigs Liang et al., 2005) . Further insight is needed in reovirus and other viral models on the specific mechanisms by which T-2 and other trichothecenes interfere with cytokine-and Ig-regulated viral clearance and how these are impacted by dose, administration route, and duration of toxin exposure.",
