The outbreak overwhelmed >10 provinces in southern China, and >1,000,000 piglets died. This outbreak was distinguished by \u2248100% illness among piglets after birth (predominantly within 7 days and sometimes within only a few hours) and death rates of 80%-100% (online Technical Appendix Table 1 , wwwnc. cdc.gov/EID/pdfs/11-1259-Techapp. pdf). Few sows or boars showed any clinical signs during the outbreak, which is not consistent with a recent report from Thailand (1). In that outbreak during late 2007, pigs of all ages were affected, exhibiting different degrees of diarrhea and no appetite. We characterized the genetic variation of the PED virus (PEDV) that caused a large-scale outbreak in China during 2010-2011 and compared it with viruses in other outbreaks. We also report a possible novel transmission pathway for PEDV.",

This hypothesis could be indirectly verifi ed by our fi eld observation that piglet death rates decreased as a result of fostering (data not shown). Our fi ndings show that PEDV was identifi ed not only in fecal samples from sick piglets, as expected, but also in the milk of the sow, which suggests vertical transmission of the virus.",

Three of these 9 mutations were at positions 16, 18, and 22 in the isolates from China; they infl uenced the hydrophobicity of the S protein as compared with that for CV777 (online Technical Appendix Figure, panel B).",

Symptoms vary from asymptomatic intermittent bacteremia to serious complications (1) . Pediculus humanus mites, the known vector of the infection, are not always identifi ed, which raises the possibility that other vectors might also be involved (2) . We report on an outbreak of B. quintana infection among a young family of high socioeconomic status and their visiting relatives.The family resides in a regional city (population 104,000) in northern Czech Republic in an old, renovated apartment located on the top fl oor, just under the roof. In the summer of 2007, hundreds of ectoparasitic mites migrated from a whole in the roof and settled on the inner side of a permanently open window before infesting family members. Two weeks later (day 1 of symptom onset), a papular rash and pruritic vesicular lesions were noted by the parents on the body and legs of their 2 children, a 1-year-old girl and a 3-year-old boy. On day 3, the girl's body temperature rose to 38.0\u00b0C, and the boy's temperature rose to 39.5\u00b0C. The rash resolved in \u224810 days in both children. Vesicular lesions on the girl's buccal mucosal membrane resolved in 5 days. Excoriated areas resulting from spontaneous rupture of lesions or scratching were still visible on day 14.On day 4, a fever (temperature, 38.5\u00b0C) and intense tibialgia, which persisted for 5 days, developed in the 33-year-old father of the infected children. On day 5, a vesicular rash, which resolved in 10 days, developed in the 33-year-old mother. The children's",
