These \"calorific rays,\" reflect, refract, absorb and transmit similar to visible light. This is now called infrared radiation.Sir John Herschel, William Herschel's son, produced the first heat picture in 1840 from solar radiation (Ring, 2007) . He called it a \"thermogram\" which is the term used to describe a picture of the temperature distribution in an object and is still used today. Early thermograms were crude, slow to process and displayed in black and white. Improvements in infrared cameras have greatly improved the quality of modern day thermograms.",

These regions consist of XRay, UV, Visible, Infrared, Microwave and Radiowave bands ( Figure 1 ). Infrared thermography is used to record the temperature distribution of a surface using infrared radiation emitted by that body within the 0.8 m to 1.0 mm band (Jones, 1998) .

An emissivity of 1 occurs for a body with no reflectivity, which is called a blackbody. Human skin exhibits an emissivity of 0.97 to 0.98 between wavelengths 2-14 m (Steketee, 1973) . Because human skin acts like a blackbody, an infrared image records a measure of the temperature distribution of the outer surface layer of the skin (Jones, 1998) .

This technology was used during outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Chiang et al., 2008; Chiu et al., 2005) . Because infrared cameras are compact, lightweight and accurate, these devices allow for rapid temperature measurement of a large number of people without exposure to potential contagious diseases. Researchers have used thermography to diagnose thyroid diseases (Helmy et al., 2008) , confirm hydrocephalus shunt patency (Goetz, Foertsch, Schoenberger, & Uhl, 2005) , examine diabetes wound management (Bharara et al., 2006) and diagnose and treat leg ulcers (Mercer et al., 2008) . Researchers are using infrared thermography in the area of exercise physiology to map out temperature differentials during exercise and rest (Merla, Mattei, Di Donato, & Romani, 2010) . Another new area of research using thermal imaging is in exploring tissue composition to determine oxygenation of internal tissues (Tepper, Neeman, Milstein, David, & Gannot, 2009 ). This work may be helpful in using infrared thermal technology using invasive endoscopy and may assist with the localization of abnormal tissue for biopsy. Katz et al. (2008) used thermal imaging to detect acute compartment syndrome in trauma patients. This technology can be beneficial for the rapid diagnosis of compartment syndrome before the need for amputation of the affected limb or death from the vascular compromise. Patients who developed compartment syndrome had a greater difference in proximal versus distal surface temperatures of the affected limb. Similarly, researchers have used infrared themography to identify patterns related to peripheral vascular diseases (Bagavathiappan et al., 2009) which can lead to asymmetrical temperature distributions. Infrared imaging may prove to be a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying perfusion pathology in adults and pediatric patients.",

Premature infants have very little fat, thin skin and high evaporative losses (Hammarlund & Sedin, 1979) . Because their skin is so thin without the fat layer for insulation, measurements taken with an infrared camera approach core temperature as do thermistors attached to their skin (Hammarlund et al., 1986) . Skin temperatures measured in the abdominal and central regions should be close to core temperature and there should be a differential lower temperature in the periphery (Simbrunner, 1995) . Another factor to keep in mind when conducting thermal imaging on premature infants is heat loss is prevalent due to immature thermoregulation. These infants have very little brown fat and decreased proteins to enable metabolic heat production, which means premature infants need heated environments to warm their bodies as they can not independently produce enough heat as they become cold (Houstek et al., 1993; Sauer, 1995) . Thermal imaging should be conducted through a cut out opening in the top of the incubator, to decrease the amount of heat loss from the environment and to obtain a measurement closest to the infant's true body temperature inside the incubator.",

These researchers used a surface silvered mirror placed at an angle of 45\u00b0 over a cut out in the roof of the incubator canopy so that the infrared camera would remain horizontal to avoid spillage of the liquid nitrogen coolant. The camera was an AGA Model 680 Thermovision, which when coupled with an electronic processor produced images on a television screen.

During the first hour, peripheral temperatures begin to decrease in relationship to central temperature and bathing can lead to a decrease in peripheral -central temperature difference. This research adds to the evidence that using thermal imaging for skin surface temperature may give some indication of changes in body temperature and perfusion associated with blood flow changes. Most likely, an overall undifferentiated pattern of skin temperature immediately after birth is indicative of fetal circulation, where peripheral vascular resistance is low. Once the ductus arteriosus closes after birth and oxygenation of blood takes place in the lungs instead of the placenta, peripheral vascular resistance becomes higher and the core becomes warmer than the periphery (Emmanouilides, Moss, Duffie, & Adams, 1964) .",

Temperature is a measure of the energy level of tissues which can yield the amount of heat stored in that tissue. When studying heat storage or energy expenditure in infants, one needs to measure temperature profiles or as many body segments as possible.

We conducted infrared imaging once a day, when the nurse was conducting morning care of the infant. Two research assistants were needed for these imaging procedures and the imaging session lasted approximately 5 minutes, once assistants were proficient in using the infrared camera. One assistant held the infant still in a prone position, using her hands to hold the infant's feet and head, while the other assistant used the infrared camera manually to image through the Drager\u00ae incubator opening (Figure 2 ). To minimize changes to the infants' thermal environment, thermal imaging was performed through the top of a customized incubator that had a cutout in the lid, which was covered with plastic wrap to preserve heat but to allow transmission for thermal imaging. Unlike previous neonatal studies using infrared thermography, handheld, uncooled cameras can image an infant directly over the incubator through the cut out, without the fear of spilling liquid nitrogen on the infant.",

We attempted to image with saran wrap over the cutout with the first two pilot infants; however, the saran wrap reduced the ability of the lens to focus on the infant. All remaining imaging was conducted while briefly removing the plastic wrap, then quickly returning the wrap in place. Incubators are engineered to maintain a continuous flow of warm air that envelopes the infant; when doors or portholes are opened, warm air should not escape. Therefore, even though we briefly removed plastic wrap, air temperature should not have decreased. We monitored environmental temperature inside the incubators with a data logger and found that infrared imaging did not decrease temperature near the infant. After the imaging session, the cutout covered with plastic wrap was also covered with a plexiglass cover made for Drager incubators. Our pilot study revealed that ELBW infants are relatively easy to image through non-invasive techniques and their thermograms provide a temperature diagram of the infant's body surface. Figure 3 illustrates temperature differentials of an infant's central and peripheral body areas.",

One of the most common neonatal gastrointestinal emergencies in ELBW infants is NEC, a disease of the intestinal tissue causing necrosis of the bowel (Blakely et al., 2005) . The etiology of NEC is not clear; however it likely involves a combination of immaturity of the intestinal epithelial barrier and mucosal immune system, predisposing these infants to bacterial invasion, particularly in the context of poor intestinal perfusion (Nankervis, Giannone, & Reber, 2008) . Because abnormal perfusion may be critical both in the development of NEC as well as for its diagnosis, we used infrared thermography to examine temperature differentials between each infants chest and abdomen over their postnatal age for the development of NEC in 13 ELBW infants. We defined infants as having NEC based on radiographic findings of suspected or definitive pneumatosis intestinalis, portal venous gas, or pneumoperitoneum. Our comparison between abdominal skin temperature and NEC was confined to 10 infants who had infrared thermal imaging as well as abdominal radiographs performed on the same day of each other.",

To facilitate temperature analysis, we adopted published techniques to measure the mean skin temperature over a desired region of interest (ROI). For our analysis, we used a segmentation tool to develop oval ROIs over the abdomen or thorax. Within each ROI, the ExaminIR \u00ae software calculated the mean skin temperature using every pixel in the ROI.

Nurse researchers may be able to use thermal imaging for wound surveillance or recognition of skin temperature changes in association with decubitus ulcers.

We are just beginning to use infrared thermal imaging to explore identification of intestinal necrosis in the operating room as more diagnostic tools are needed to help surgeons differentiate between ischemic and viable bowel. Researchers of the future may design studies to use infrared thermography in surveillance of perfusion after gastroschisis or omphalocele repair as was done by (Saxena & Wililital, 2008) . Infrared thermography technology may decrease medical costs and length of stay for neonates by allowing clinicians early surveillance of skin temperature differentials associated with pathology such as NEC or poor perfusion or with postoperative healing after repair of abdominal defects and subsequent early treatment or feeding progression. Many more research and clinical uses will be revealed as researchers advance this methodology. This technology is in its infancy and research opportunities are endless. A & 4B:Comparison of concurrent infrared thermal image (A) and abdominal radiograph (B) of a single ELBW infant with necrotizing enterocolitis. Images were taken on same day with head superior. Thermogram is taken with FLIR SC640 camera (FLIR, North Ballerica MA) and expressed using color palette. Bright, red-yellow areas (i.e. over thorax) correlate with higher temperature compared to darker, blue areas (ie. central area of abdomen, periphery around infant) which correlate with cooler temperature. Abdominal radiograph shows fixed featureless bowel segments, pneumatosis intestinalis and portal venous gas, consistent with NEC.",
