Serum miRNA was gradually considered as molecular markers for disease diagnosis. This study was designed to analyze differential serum miRNAs level in hormone-induced nontraumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (hormone-NOFH) patients. Methods: We selected 30 patients with hormone-NOFH as case group, and 30 healthy volunteers were recruited as control group. miRCURYTM LNA miRNA chip and quantitative RT-PCR were used to examine differential miRNAs expression. Correlation assay was performed between miRNAs and NOFH trait. Results: We found that 9 miRNAs were upregulated while 3 miRNAs were downregulated in hormone-TOFH patient serum by result of miRNA chip. QRT-PCR assay revealed that the level of miR-423-5p was significantly increased and miR-10a-5p was significantly decreased. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we observed that miR-423-5p serum level is positive association to FHC levels whereas miR-10a-5p has no association with FHC levels. Furthermore, miR-423-5p is negatively correlated to its downstream molecule-adiponectin. Conclusion: We report a miRNA profile of hormone-NOFH and provide a new perspective to understand this intricate disease. This novel information suggests the potential roles of miR-423-5p in the diagnosis, prognosis biomarkers, or therapy targets of hormone-NOFH.",

They function as translational inhibitor or mRNA degradation promoter by binding to the 3 0 untranslated region of their target mRNAs [3] . Recently, the biological roles of miRNA are under intense investigation, and their dysfunction has been considered to be extensively involved in the pathogenesis of numerous types of disease, including cancers, cardiovascular disease, lymphocytic leukemia as well as orthopaedics diseases [4] [5] [6] . Therefore, miRNA may play an important roles in the occurrence and development of various types of disease and may function as a novel biomarker and tool for clinical therapy. Currently, abnormal miRNA expression has been shown to play an important role in development of bone dysfunction. Currently, the best studied miRNAs that are involved in differentiation of osteoclasts are miR-21, miR-155 and miR-223 [7] [8] [9] . Studies by Zhang et al. established that at least 11 different miRNAs (i.e., miR-23a, miR-30c, miR-34c, miR-133a, miR-135a, miR-137, miR-204, miR-205, miR-217, miR-218, and miR-338) contributed to control osteoblast differentiation [10] and are expressed to different degrees in both osteogenic and non-osteogenic cells. miR-210 is intensely expressed in osteonecrosis, and was speculated to play a role in osteonecrosis pathogenesis [11] . Dysfunction of miR-17-5p is demonstrated to contribute to NOFH pathogenesis [12] .",

Due to complexity of pathogenesis, the therapeutic method has been always explored. Notably, the therapeutic trials to regulate the endogenous miRNAs related to diseases provide the potential of therapeutical targeting. Presently, the obstacle is the determination of the target miRNA. In this study, by screening with miRNA microchip, we found 9 prominent miRNAs (miR-378, miR-147, miR-130a-3p, miR-28-5p, miR-592, miR-423-5p, miR-195-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-145) with increased levels and three prominent miRNAs (miR-10a-5p, miR-484, miR-99a-5p) with decline levels in the serum of hormone-NOFH patients vs. healthy control. Based on this result, we test this differential miRNAs expression by qRT-PCR, and found out one upregulated miRNA (miR-423-5p) expression and one downregulated miRNA (miR-10a-5p) expression. Moreover, in NOFH patients, there is significant association between the serum miR-423-5p level and an important known diagnostic parameters (Index of FHC) as well as serum mark for NOFH (adiponectin).

For example, miR-378 was shown to directly upregulate bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) expression that is essential for osteogenic differentiation in mesenchymal progenitor cells [17] . Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is a key cytokine regulator of bone and mediates inflammatory bone loss, however, it-induced osteoblasts apoptosis was attenuated by miR-23a [18] . miR-204 attenuated osteoblast differentiation by directly targeting Runx2 in MSCs [19] . we reveal miR-34a as a key osteoclast suppressor of osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption and the bone metastatic niche by inhibiting transforming growth factorb-induced factor 2 (Tgif2) that is significant for bone resorption.",

Given this, we combined miRNA microchip assay and qRT-PCR in NOFH serum and attempt to find out changed levels of specific miRNAs in circulation of NOFH. The results of our study are consistent with this notion, showing that increased level of miR-423-5p and decreased level of miR-10a-5p in hormone-NOFH patients may be used as markers for NOFH diagnosis.

Abnormal lipid metabolism and bone marrow fat cell hypertrophy/proliferation play important roles in NOFH.

Shinoda et al. suggested distinct adiponectin actions on bone formation [27] . With regard to the important role of adiponectin in NOFH pathogenesis, Shuai et al. proved that low adiponectin level is significantly associated with the presence of NOFH and adiponectin may act as a biomarker for NOFH diagnosis.
