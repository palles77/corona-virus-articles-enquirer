Discussion In this retrospective study, we analyzed the levels of serum IgM, IgG and other clinical parameters in 116 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. The results showed that serum IgM levels were higher in died group, negatively correlated with clinical outcome, and predicted the mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Thus, elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgM levels indicate poor outcome. SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus with higher transmission trend and weaker pathogenicity compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 6,10 .

SARS-CoV specific IgG antibodies persisted for a long time over three months, though the SARS-CoV specific IgM peaked in third week and remained measurable for a much shorter period, which were both analyzed by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 15 . Similarly, as shown in Figure 1C, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM levels peaked in forth week after onset of COVID-19 pneumonia, then decreased more slowly than SARS-CoV specific IgM, while serum IgG levels increased over 8 weeks. Relatively weaker pathogenicity and prolonged viral shedding provided the rationale for the relatively slower but long-lasting immune response, and provided a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future 6,11 . The profile of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies might be helpful in the diagnosis and in epidemiologic surveys. Both matched and unmatched analyses yielded similar results that elevated SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM levels indicated poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Similarly, another team found that a higher titer of antibody titer was associated with a worse clinical classification 16 . The reason is speculated as follows. Firstly, at least in some stages, high antibody levels indicate high viral load, which is a prognostic factor for poor outcome 17 . Secondly, a neutralizing antibody can bind to the surface spike protein of coronaviruses and mediate viral entry into IgG Fc receptor-expressing cells, indicating complex roles of antibodies in viral elimination 18 . Furthermore, the study demonstrates that serum IgM levels were significantly correlated with leucocyte count, indicating more severe inflammation associated with coronavirus infection or secondary infection.
