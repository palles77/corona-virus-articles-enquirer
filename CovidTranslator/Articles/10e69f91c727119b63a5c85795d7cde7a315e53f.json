This problem has accelerated the trend towards an increase in airport capacity for larger aircraft everywhere, a process which started in the UK and is now continuing throughout Europe, especially in Germany. Apart from development at the hubs, however, many small airports have also been enlarged, former military airbases have been converted to civilian use, and new runways are to be built in areas away from centres of population. These changes have occurred within a short period of time. In Germany, the number of available airports with runways over 1800 m will have doubled in a period of 10-15 years.",

In Germany, in particular, traffic is increasing substantially, and between 1997 and 2015 passenger services are predicted to double (Table 1) . This would mean an increase in air transport\u00d5s share of the passenger transport market from 4% to 7% (Table 2) . Such levels of actual and predicted growth have led to numerous enlargements of the infrastructure on the ground. Not only are measures to increase the capacities of airports in German conurbations being taken: the number of airports that can be used by larger jets (more than 100 passengers) will increase significantly across the country. This fact underlines the competitive nature of airport infrastructure provision.",

Frankfurt is the main hub--with 48 million passengers in 2003--and Munich, handling 24 million passengers, functions as a secondary hub, but nearly every region also has good access to air transport. None the less, the boom of the low-cost airlines, which ''constitute one of the most obvious repercussions of EU air transport liberalization'' (Graham, 2000, p. 75) , is causing not only a \u00d4revolution in the skies\u00d5 (Calder, 2002) but also, especially in Germany, a \u00d4revolution on the ground\u00d5. There will be a twofold increase in the number of airports with longer runways within the next 10-15 years, but at present the growth of airport capacities is disorganized. The main problem in Germany is that no real national coordination of airport capacity planning takes place. For statutory reasons, the airports have been under the authority of the separate federal states since 1961. There is also an absence of national debate about sustainable aviation, in contrast to countries such as Switzerland and the UK.",

Only in Frankfurt, Hamburg and D\u00fc sseldorf do private investors hold shares. Three newcomer airports are privately owned or operated, all by foreign investors (Lahr and Schwerin/Parchim by -PlaneStation Group plc/UK and Niederrhein by Airport Network BV/NL). In three cases, established airports have shares in neighbouring airports which they are trying to develop: Frankfurt and Hahn (called Frankfurt-Hahn), D\u00fcsseldorf and M\u00f6 nchengladbach (called D\u00fc sseldorf-M\u00f6 chengladbach) and Stuttgart and Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden. The disadvantage of this for the smaller airports is their role as a dependent satellite airport, although they do benefit from better funding and support with know-how and second-hand equipment.

            "text": "Due to the high airport density in Germany, every airport which aspires to market entry has to find its niche. Four different corporate strategies were identified, often to be found in combination. The first type is the satellite airport, which alleviates the capacity problems of a nearby larger airport (e.g. M\u00f6 nchengladbach). The second type is the 24-hour cargo airport (e.g. Nordholz and Lahr), which is located away from centres of population and offers unrestricted access for all aircraft (especially for noisy air freighters at night). The third type is what Cidell (2003) termed aeroplex, that is an airport or airfield in a rural area in combination with an industrial park (e.g. Zweibr\u00fc cken or Memmingen). The last, but the most favoured, type is the lowcost hub (e.g. Hahn or Niederrhein). Most of the newcomer airports are supported with substantial subsidies and, as such, it is important to question their success. The most recent data show that only Hahn is frequently used, with 2.4 million passengers and 22,000 t of cargo (without trucking) in 2003. Niederrhein Airport, situated between Dutch and West German conurbations, will possibly develop in a similar way. All the other aspiring airports have problems with attracting airlines, however. An extreme example is the former Soviet airbase at Cochstedt, which has already been closed, in spite of federal state and local authority investment to the tune of \u20ac45 million. Here, the \u00d4job-ma-chine\u00d5 failed, and other airports are likely to go the same way.",

In 2002, a Boeing 737-700 (to Majorca) was only able to operate with payload restrictions, i.e. a reduced number of passengers. The airport operator, owned by the local authorities and the federal state of Hesse, is therefore planning to build a completely new 2500 m runway by 2008. The problem is that there are four nearby competitors: Paderborn/Lippstadt and Erfurt, and Frankfurt and Hannover, which both can be reached by high speed train (ICE) in 1.5 h.

As a result, there has been a sharp decline in the number of airbases. In 1990, 72 airbases with longer runways were still in operation, whereas today there are only 32 (Table 4 ). In addition, permanent civil operations are also allowed on a few German Air Force airbases (Bundeswehr, 2003) . Twenty-nine airbases were converted for civil and general aviation and only 15 were closed, to be used for other kinds of development. Some of them were built over with industrial estates, but alternative use often poses problems for local authorities: they might be advised to look at the solutions in the UK, which has had much more experience in this sector (Gallent et al., 2000) . A special problem, not only in the former GDR, is the neglected deposits of toxic waste (including ammunition), which is an obstacle to the re-use of airbases.",

The closure of the sites in the 1990s thus came as a shock to them: ''the loss of the revenue source was seen as disastrous'' (Cidell, 2003, p. 93 ). In the following years, local authorities made great efforts to stimulate the local economy. One of the first ideas was to convert the airbases into airfields or airports for civilian use, but in most cases the regional authorities overestimated the potential for this, tending to disregard the disadvantages of the airbases\u00d5 location. As Cidell (2003) notes, the bases were originally sited for reasons of military strategy rather than for the needs of civil aviation. Cidell also ascertained that in the United States many bases which had been converted to another kind of use, but still contained runways, later took up the idea of a civilian airport again. In Germany the situation is exactly the same. At many former airbases which were converted to uses other than civil aviation, the option for a developing airport still exists and could be revived.",

For this reason, an airport concept was submitted in 2000 (Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Housing, 2000) . It recommends enlarging satellite airports and integrating them into the regional transport system. Additionally, it suggests that international airports should give financial aid to the satellite airports in their region. Since these airports lie within the responsibility of the federal states, however, these objectives are not included in the latest national transport plan (Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Housing, 2003) . For this reason, and due to coalition agreements between the Social Democratic Party and the Green Party, the Federal Government\u00d5s statements remain fairly vague and inconsistent. On the one hand, they emphasise that the substitution of air transport by rail transport is necessary, while, on the other hand, they call for the extension of already existing airports as far as local and environmental conditions will allow. Whether or not this relates only to the 18 international airports or also to the enlargement of smaller airports is not clear.",

It supports legislation in favour of citizens suffering from aircraft noise, though EU legislation plays an important role in the support of newcomer airports.

Regarding scheduled flights, the regional authorities have many arguments in favour of newcomer airports. First of all, they claim that an airport with \u00d4traditional\u00d5 scheduled services to German or European conurbations would support domestic industry. This is often true, but the chances of attracting scheduled flights to a domestic hub like Frankfurt or Munich are very poor, since the established airports are strong competitors in this field and the ICE high speed train network is displacing more and more domestic flights. Hannover Airport is a good example: in 1992, eight domestic destinations were offered; in 2004 only three remained. Many domestic connections from small airports were also discontinued in the last few years, most of them to Berlin (from Kiel, Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden, Siegerland, Augsburg and Hahn). Small airports in Germany usually require subsidies to promote traditional scheduled flights.

Humphreys and Francis (2002, p. 253 ) noted this in the UK, but it applies to Germany, too. A particular problem for German airports which impedes the acquisition of new airlines and destinations is the dominating role of Lufthansa. Nearly every German carrier which owns aircraft suitable for scheduled flights to smaller airports (18-70 passengers) depends on the former flag carrier. Either they belong to the Lufthansa group (like Eurowings) or they are a franchise partner (Lufthansa Regional, formerly Team Lufthansa), or they are at least partners in the Lufthansa mileage programme. According to these criteria, only two small carriers are fully independent. Because other domestic or foreign carriers are normally not interested in operating regional aircraft, some airports have asked local business aviation carriers to offer scheduled flights (e.g. in Kiel, Neubrandenburg, Kassel and Siegerland), but they have had only limited success, due to the small and uncomfortable planes (e.g. Beech 1900, Metroliner or King Air 200) and size-related marketing problems.",

This entailed expensive triangle flights, and in some cases positioning flights from the carriers\u00d5 home bases were also necessary. Sometimes the planes were chartered by local travel agents who were unable to cope with the difficult circumstances, and this resulted in many flights being cancelled at short notice.

Many remote airports had the unrealistic dream of filling several air freighters every week, forgetting that even at the hubs most of the freight is carried as additional cargo on passenger jets. The newcomer airports are also often less successful than the data indicate, since most of the air cargo is only trucked to the next cargo hub (for example, at Hahn the figure is approximately 80%). Hopes of attracting integrators were also disappointed. These companies have already chosen their hubs in Europe (UPS in Cologne, FedEx in Paris, DHL in Brussels or TNT in Li\u00e8ge), but airports with free capacity might have the prospect of developing as a secondary hub, especially in the case of integrators having to relocate due to night flight or noise restrictions.",

The Commission has not issued a general ban on agreements between regional airports and low-cost airlines, but decided that the following forms of aid could not be authorised: reduced airport charges, reduced ground handling fees, aid provided for existing routes and one-shot incentives provided for the opening of new routes which do not take account of the actual costs. In the future, subsidies for point-to-point European routes are only allowed for a five-year period: they must correspond to a \u00d4maximum intensity\u00d5 of 50% and, crucially, must be available to any airline. \u2022 Strasbourg. In September 2003, the French appeals court at Nancy barred subsidies being paid to Ryanair by the Bas-Rhin Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

In the suit lodged by Air France, the court ruled that this was illegal state aid and an improper use of public funds. \u2022 Airport names.

A rule-of-thumb investigation based on data from the 17 biggest German airports shows that 100,000 passengers (for example, one daily 737-800 flight) generate approximately 110 jobs at an airport (airport operators 20; authorities 10; airlines 40; other: 40), with about 130-200 additional jobs also being created outside the airport. Whether aspiring smaller airports will generate the same number of jobs cannot yet be ascertained, as hardly any research has been done on this subject to date: it is indeed questionable whether they can provide jobs to the same extent (Graham and Guyer, 2000) . At many German newcomer airports, part-time jobs predominate, often held by students or retired military personnel. Besides this, low-cost airlines usually employ fewer people than full-service carriers.",

This is especially true of conversion airports which have large, but built-up premises (e.g. at Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden or Lahr). If an airport could establish an innovative cluster of aviation-related companies and institutions, however, it could generate positive external effects as regards employment and trade and industry (for example, at the \u00d4research airport\u00d5 in Braunschweig) (H\u00fc bl et al., 2000) .",

Yet an airport is only one of many location factors. Airports can contribute to economic development and their prestige value is high, but they do not guarantee the economic prosperity of a region. It is therefore questionable whether a newcomer airport in a disadvantaged region could be successful (Cezanne and Mayer, 2003) . In Germany, only the small airports in regions with well-developed economic structure-such as Dortmund or Mannheim--have prospered. In most cases, small airports are not economically viable--the regional authorities have to compensate for their losses permanently (H\u00fc bl et al., 2000) --but in the long-run although such airports are not lucrative profit centres, they can stimulate the regional economy.",

These airports will give citizens a ''greater choice when it comes to flying.'' Although air transport within the EU has been liberalised to a great extent, the Council Regulation 2408/92 Access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes (European Community, 1992) allows member states to subsidise routes to smaller airports. A member state ''may impose a public service obligation'' (continuity, regularity, capacity and pricing) in respect of particular scheduled air services. It must either be a route to an airport in a ''peripheral or development region'' or a ''thin route to any regional airport.'' However, such routes must be ''considered vital for the economic development of the region'' (European Community, 1992, Article 4, 1 (a)). If a scheduled service complies with these requirements, the member state may pay a reimbursement to the air carrier. The rules are widely interpretable and nonspecific. For instance, except for 35 \u00d4category 1 airports\u00d5, every EU airport is a \u00d4regional air-port\u00d5. Whereas other member states mainly subsidise routes to remote regions or to islands (Sicily, Sardinia, Azores, Hebrides), Germany (i.e. the federal states) supports air transport to regions with reasonable rail access, so criticism of the high subsidies for scheduled connections (e.g. Rostock-Munich) may appear justified. That said, the access of disadvantaged areas (like Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania) to wider networks is a basic social equity objective (Graham, 2003b) .",

            "text": "The main reason for the uncoordinated process of airport capacity expansion in Germany is that the responsibility for aviation lies in the hands of the federal states. They do not normally dovetail their airport planning, and no detailed nationwide concept for air transport exists (in contrast to surface transport). It would seem, however, that some kind of airport development planning by the federal government is imperative. This would require a far-reaching legislative amendment, but a national strategy would be able to develop airport capacities more efficiently and could prevent the abovementioned process. The main goal should be a comprehensive geographical approach instead of spatially limited federal state planning. No parallel development of neighbouring \u00d4newcomer airports\u00d5 should be allowed if none of them will have sufficient demand. In addition to the environmental impact assessment which is regulated by European and national law, assessments of the wider sustainability and economic development impacts of each airport should be made compulsory. State intervention and subsidies of any kind ought to be reduced. There does not appear to be a necessity to create more airport capacity outside the urbanised European core regions. Due to the fact that a ''substantial number of airports . . . have adequate capacity for the foreseeable future'' (Graham and Guyer, 1999, p. 169) , in many countries ''enough airport capacity exists but not where the airlines want it'' (Humphreys and Francis, 2002, p. 249) . Like several NGOs, however, the state should also question whether new airports and runways are really required, and consider whether the forecasted demand for air travel is artificial due to the subsidised ticket prices. Airport capacity planning should always be demand-orientated, so aspiring airports should grow step by step in a suitable modular way. All this could reduce prestige-driven and ineffectual investments, land consumption and other non-sustainable impacts.",
