Methods: Fifty general ICU survivors (ventilated for \u22655 days) performed a maximal cycle ergometer CPET within 6 weeks of hospital discharge. Health-related quality of life was measured by the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 version 2.0 questionnaire. Results: Fifty patients (median age, 57 years; median Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II score, 16) completed a CPET 24 \u00b1 14 days after hospital discharge with no adverse events. Significant exercise limitation was present with peak VO 2 56% \u00b1 16% predicted and anaerobic threshold (AT) 41% \u00b1 13% of peak predicted VO 2 . Prospectively stratified subgroup comparison showed that patients ventilated for 14 days or more had a significantly lower AT and peak VO 2 than those ventilated for 5 to 14 days (AT: 9.6 vs 11.7 mL/kg per minute O 2 , P = .009; peak VO 2 : 12.9 vs 15.3 mL/kg per minute O 2 , P = .022). At peak exercise, heart rate reserve was 25% \u00b1 14%, breathing reserve was 47% \u00b1 19%, and the respiratory exchange ratio was 0.96 \u00b1 0.11. Ventilatory equivalents for CO 2 (EqCO 2 ) were 39 \u00b1 9. Conclusions: Significant exercise limitation is evident in patients who have had critical illness. Etiology of exercise limitation appears multifactorial, with general deconditioning and muscle weakness as major contributory factors. Early CPET appears a practical method of assessing exercise capacity in ICU survivors. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing could be used to select patients who may benefit most from a targeted physical rehabilitation program, aid in exercise prescription, and help assess the response to intervention.",

A major advantage over other objective measures of exercise capacity (eg, 6MWT) is that it provides information that may identify cardiac, respiratory, or musculoskeletal contributions to any exercise limitation present. The anaerobic threshold (AT) is an objective measure of functional or aerobic capacity that normally occurs at 50% to 60% of peak exercise capacity. Importantly and unlike peak oxygen consumption (peak VO 2 ), it is less influenced by either learning effect or patient effort. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is advocated as a tool to guide exercise prescription in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure [6, 7] . To date, its use after critical illness has been restricted to the study of specific patient populations including survivors of the severe acute respiratory syndrome and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [8, 9] . To our knowledge, CPET has never been used in the assessment of general adult ICU survivors in the immediate post-hospital discharge period. The purpose of our study was therefore 2-fold:",

Peripheral oxygen saturations (SpO 2 ) and noninvasive blood pressure were monitored throughout the test. After a period of observation at rest to allow the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) to plateau (typically 1-3 minutes), subjects completed 3 minutes of unloaded cycling at 60 revolutions per minute. Load was then applied to the pedals in a ramp-like fashion increasing by 10 to 15 W/min until maximum exercise capacity was reached. For safety reasons, the study protocol required immediate termination of the test if the subject experienced any of the following adverse events: chest pain, altered sensorium, ST depression greater than 2 mm on the exercise electrocardiogram, and emotional distress. Two intensive care physicians with advanced life support skills were present throughout all tests.

A number of our patients were known to have premorbid cardiac failure as documented in Table E1 ; because routine echocardiography was not performed as part of this study, it is not possible to further define the contribution of impaired stroke volume to the reduced oxygen pulse values seen. Patients were also anemic, with a mean hemoglobin concentration of 10.3 \u00b1 1.2 g/dL at the time of hospital discharge. The interpretation of oxygen pulse data is further confounded by the number of patients \u03b2-blocked at the time of their CPET. Rate-limiting medication can affect the results of a CPET by increasing diastolic filling time and therefore stroke volume and oxygen pulse. This effect is countered by a reduction in peak heart rate achieved and consequently the peak cardiac output and oxygen consumption achievable. Patients taking rate-limiting drugs (36%) had a significantly greater oxygen pulse than those who were not (9.8 vs 8.1 mL per beat, P = .009), although no significant difference in exercise capacity was seen.",
