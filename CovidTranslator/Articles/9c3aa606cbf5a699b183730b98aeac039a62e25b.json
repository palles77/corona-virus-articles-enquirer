A high vigilance for the disease, frequent and regular temperature monitoring, early case identification and isolation of patients, as well as tracing and home quarantine of contacts, played major roles in controlling the outbreak. Hospitals were dedicated to the screening and treatment of SARS patients. Within and between hospitals, movement by healthcare workers, patients and visitors were restricted, as was the number of hospital visitors. Staff education and audits of infection control practices also featured prominently.",

Consequently, N95 masks were not used by her health caregivers and 27 SARS-infected persons were eventually traced to her. Another patient with diabetes and chronic renal disease, on discharge from TTSH, was admitted to an open ward in Singapore General Hospital (SGH) on March 24 for gastrointestinal bleeding and urinary tract infection. Like the 53 year-old patient in TTSH, his medical problems resulted in atypical SARS symptoms. His SARS infection was unrecognised in spite of his caregivers' deliberating on his possibly having SARS. He spread the infection to 37 HCWs, patients and visitors.

On 3 September 2003, a graduate student, who had been working in a research laboratory where work on SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was conducted, was admitted to SGH for a febrile illness. SARS was suspected and later confirmed by the Virology Laboratory (9). This incident did not result in secondary transmission and another outbreak, but deserves mention for the additional control measures instituted in the laboratories.",
