In contrast with H5N1 with over 650 confirmed cases over 11 years, H7N9 has infected over 450 persons within 2 years. The case fatality rate for H7N9 (35 %) is lower than for H5N1 (60 %) or H10N8 (67 %) but is comparable to that for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV), another emerging zoonosis with travel-associated importations. Exposure to poultry and fomites are considered the likely sources of infection for H7N9, H5N1, and H10N8, with limited human-to-human transmission in close contacts. Most cases have occurred in local populations of affected countries, and travel-related risk can be mitigated by avoiding exposure. Vaccines, antivirals, and other therapeutics remain in development stage or of modest benefit for dangerous infections carrying high morbidity and mortality.",

In the past 15 years, two avian influenza strains, H5N1 and H7N9, have successfully jumped the species barrier, resulting in outbreaks of human infection. Although there has been no evidence of sustained human-tohuman transmission to date, if this occurs, we would be closer to fulfilling all the necessary conditions for a devastating human pandemic. H5N1 influenza continues to smolder in Southeast Asia since 1997 [1], but the emergence of H7N9 in China in 2013 raised concerns for a new avian influenza threat [2] . In contrast with H5N1 with 650 confirmed cases since 2003, H7N9 has infected over 400 persons in just over 1 year [3, 4] . How this situation evolves over the next few seasons may have far-reaching implications for our cumulative pandemic risk globally (Fig. 1) .",

After this first cluster of 18 cases, H5N1 reemerged in 2003 in China. Subsequently, H5N1 spread through Southeast Asia. Turkey marked the first occurrence outside of Asia, followed by Iraq, Azerbaijan, and Egypt between January and April 2006 [1] . A total of 650 laboratory-confirmed human infections have been officially reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from 15 countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Europe [3] . Sporadic importations have occurred rarely, most recently in Canada from a traveler returning from Beijing [6] . H5N1 cases peaked in January 2006, when the outbreak was brought under control through expensive culling campaigns in affected countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Yearly peaks around January have continued since then, but these have gradually stabilized [3] .",

In such cases, respiratory tract specimens are tested for influenza H5N1 and for SARS coronavirus. Clusters, defined as two or more cases of PUE with an epidemiological link that cannot be explained by local investigators, are escalated to the national Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for further investigation [7] . In March 2013, a case of PUE was tested for new influenza subtypes; this became the first documented case of H7N9 and led to the first three cases being diagnosed in Shanghai and Anhui, although no epidemiological link was established between the three cases [8] . After these cases were described, the definition of PUE was broadened and more discretion given to individual physicians to test when clinically appropriate in order to increase the sensitivity of the program.",

Sixty-eight percent of individuals with H7N9 identified through the PUE surveillance system were from the Shanghai municipality and Zhejiang Province. These two regions, however, only contain about 6 % of the total Chinese population; conversely, 10 % of H7N9 cases were reported from the remaining 21 provinces where approximately 57 % of the populations reside. These numbers may represent concentrated foci of infection; however, variable reporting among regions may yield inaccurate estimates of the true disease burden and distribution.

A meta-analysis of H5N1 studies which included seroepidemiology studies that met WHO criteria and excluded diagnosed H5N1 cases found a seroprevalence of 1.2 % (95 % CI 0.6 to 2.1) in 7304 participants, with higher seropositivity (1.4 %) in poultry workers [11] . Given the higher H5N1 seropositivity rate among poultry workers, this occupational group would likely have a higher risk of early exposure to emerging avian influenza viruses. A retrospective study using stored serum samples from 1544 occupational groups including workers in live poultry markets, farms, slaughterhouses, and wild bird habitats in eastern China (Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui) was analyzed to look for evidence of circulating H7N9 prior to the onset of the outbreak. Surprisingly, samples taken between January and November 2012 showed no evidence of immune reactivity to H7N9 [12] .",

There was concern that H10N8 could be even more widespread than H7N9 because H10N8 has primarily been found in migratory birds, rather than poultry. Thankfully, only two cases have officially been reported to date (Table 1) [20] .",

Influenza viruses bind with sialic acid receptors of which there are two subtypes relevant for avian influenza strains: \u03b1-2,3 sialic acid receptors found in the gastrointestinal tract of birds and also in the lower respiratory tract of humans and \u03b1-2,6 sialic acid receptors which are found in abundance in the human upper respiratory tract. Influenza viruses adapted to avian hosts selectively bind to \u03b1-2,3 sialic acid receptors, whereas those adapted to humans bind to the \u03b1-2,6 subtype. Genetic sequencing of binding sites and X-ray crystallography reveal that H7N9 binds strongly to \u03b1-2,3 receptors and weakly to \u03b1-2,6, unlike pandemic H1N1 which preferentially binds to \u03b1-2,6 receptors [23, 24] . Although H7N9 and H5N1 are poorly adapted for human transmissibility at the present time, changes in receptor binding may occur with accumulated mutations arising from host pressure and faulty viral RNA replication. Some of the necessary mutations have already been identified in H5N1; passage through ferrets has produced isolates capable of preferential binding to \u03b1-2,6 receptors, making this situation theoretically possible [25] .",

Influenza vaccine production is dependent on embryonated chicken eggs for culture, which is the rate-limiting production factor currently. Egg-independent vaccine production strategies are undergoing active investigation. Examples include cell-derived whole-virus inactivated vaccines which can take 1-3 months to manufacture, compared to 5-6 months for egg-based vaccines which have been tested in phase 3 trials.

To underscore this issue, the first case of H5N1 was imported into Canada by a returning traveler. The patient was ethnically Chinese, resided in Canada, and had spent a month in Beijing. She developed symptoms on her way home and died soon after [6] . A survey of Chinese communities living in Europe demonstrated that the perceived risks and severity of avian influenza were lower compared to the general population [59] . Travelers visiting friends and family (VFR) in avian influenza-affected countries may therefore be at increased risk compared to other travelers to the region ( Table 2) .",

Individuals may continue to be at risk due to poultry exposures. The risk of a global pandemic remains low currently, in the absence of sustained, efficient transmission between humans. However, with reservoirs that cannot be completely eradicated, these pre-pandemic threats will remain with us for the foreseeable future. Appropriate preventive measures will protect most travelers to areas affected by avian influenza, but those at higher risk may include VFR travelers and immigrants who are less likely to be reached by pre-travel advice. All three avian influenza strains still carry high morbidity and mortality, with proven treatment options limited to antivirals and supportive care.",
