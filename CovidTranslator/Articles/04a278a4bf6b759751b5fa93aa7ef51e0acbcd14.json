In the context of the governance of global health, including WHO reform, it will be important to distil lessons learned from the Ebola outbreak. The Lancet invited a group of respected global health practitioners to reflect on these lessons, to explore the idea of global health security, and to offer suggestions for next steps. Their contributions describe some of the major threats to individual and collective human health, as well as the values and recommendations that should be considered to counteract such threats in the future. Many different perspectives are proposed. Their common goal is a more sustainable and resilient society for human health and wellbeing.",

The Ebola crisis has put the spotlight on the importance of reducing the vulnerability of societies to infectious disease threats that spread across national borders. This aspect of health security-collective health securityhas been the focus of attention and the commonly understood conceptualisation of health security for centuries. The paradigm today is rapid detection of these events, and rapid response. But there is a second, equally important aspect to health security that is less appreciated that the west Africa Ebola outbreaks have also tragically highlighted: individual health security. This is security that comes from access to safe and effective health services, products, and technologies. Ebola-infected health workers from developed countries have been repatriated from west Africa for care in their own countries where there is health security for individuals-hospitals that provide safe and effective access to life-saving medicines and services. Meanwhile, Ebola-infected west Africans have had to accept that health care is not always safe, not always effective, and not always accessible-that their own health security is yet again at risk. As the Ebola epidemic has unfolded, the part that has been played by substandard infection control and inadequate access to effective health products and services has clearly demonstrated a wider scope of health security-the intertwining of collective and individual health security.",

As international travel and trade increased, a series of international treaties and conventions were developed to attempt to stop the cross-border spread of plague and three additional infectious diseases-cholera, smallpox, and yellow fever. 6 In 1969 the International Health Regulations set out a collaborative global framework to enhance the world' s health security against these four infectious diseases with a reporting requirement and predetermined actions to be implemented at borders. 7, 8 After the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and the strong reminder that border controls cannot stop the international spread of disease, the International Health Regulations were broadened in scope. 9 They now require reporting of any public health emergency of international concern and real-time dialogue among affected governments and WHO to propose real-time, evidence-based actions at borders; they also require countries to strengthen eight core capacities in public health aimed at more rapid detection and response to public health events where and when they occur.10 Although these requirements have not been met in all countries,11,12 the regulations provide an agreed global framework for enhancement of collective health security-a framework for investment by countries and development agencies to strengthen public health so that outbreaks caused by infectious organisms such as Ebola can be rapidly detected and contained.",

The Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), established by WHO and UNICEF in the late 1970s, was not developed to provide a vaccine as a means to protect collective health security. It was established to save the individual lives of children. 18 EPI now provides sustained vaccine supplies to countries at minimum or no cost, and prevents tetanus, pertussis, measles, diphtheria, and polio in countries where health systems successfully deliver these vaccines. One of these diseases, polio, is now scheduled for eradication. Access to polio vaccine has thus satisfi ed an individual health security need and at the same time led to herd immunity, which has enhanced collective health security by eliminating polio in all but three countries, and will hopefully lead to eradication.19",

This strategy connected global health with core political interests of states, transformed the responsibilities of WHO, and produced the revised International Health Regulations.10 However, the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in west Africa damaged the strategy' s political, institutional, and legal pillars. It revealed countries' lack of political commitment, battered WHO' s credibility, and weakened the International Health Regulations. Resurrection of global health security will need restoration of each pillar. Unfortunately, the damage exposes challenges that states previously have failed to handle, including sustaining global health as a political priority, reforming WHO, and improving compliance with international health law. In view of the difficulty of what is needed, whether the Ebola outbreak can rejuvenate global health security is far from clear. How Ebola went from \"an exotic tropical disease to a priority for global health security\"35 involves a backstory in which WHO and its member states built and then undermined the strategy for global health security. Starting in the mid-1990s, WHO crafted new approaches to dangerous disease events, such as the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN)36 and the revised International Health Regulations. Outbreaks, including SARS and pandemic influenza H1N1, tested these innovations. In 2010-11, the International Health Regulations Review Committee analysed the H1N1 pandemic, acknowledged positive features of the response, and identified problems with the regulations and WHO' s ability to address health emergencies. Warning \"the world is ill-prepared\" to handle any \"sustained and threatening public-health emergency\", the Committee recommended improving compliance with the regulations and WHO' s capacities to manage dangerous disease events.12 WHO did not adopt these recommendations. Concerns about global health security informed WHO' s reform process, which started in 2010, but the process failed to support the Review Committee' s recommendations or strengthen WHO' s responsibilities in this area. The 2012 deadline for meeting obligations on surveillance and response capacities in the International Health Regulations passed with most countries not in compliance. 37 The Review Committee also flagged this issue,12 but WHO' s reform process did nothing about it. When fiscal difficulties forced decisions about priorities, WHO cut funding and staffing for its surveillance and response activities,38 rejecting Review Committee proposals for strengthening them. 12 The cuts reflected WHO' s strategic choice to de-emphasise global health security and increase attention on problems outside the global health security realm, including non-communicable diseases. The reform process also failed to tackle long recognised problems with WHO' s regional and country offices that undermine the organisation' s effectiveness.",

Although the threat of Ebola importation contributed to preparation of an effective response, the other countries already had components of the GHSA in place, and although not fully developed it showed that even nascent capacity was crucial in facilitation of a timely response. In Nigeria, a dedicated public health emergency operations centre for polio eradication and a cadre of Field Epidemiology Training Program-trained56 epidemiologists facilitated the multisectoral coordination and extensive contact tracing efforts needed to control the outbreak once it spread as it spread within Lagos, and from Lagos to a second city.51 A common theme in quelling the Ebola importation events has been the ready availability of trained ministry of health staff who used existing surveillance systems, laboratories, and public health emergency operations capabilities to quickly control Ebola.

Although traditionally conceptualised as protection from the pandemic spread of infectious diseases, health security, as David Heymann argues, does indeed need broader collective action to ensure that all people have \"access to safe and effective health services, products, and technologies\" they need to ensure their own individual health security. This expanded definition recognises that collective health security is also the sum of individual health security, and compels global action to provide individuals in all countries with access to essential health care.",

It was then that Chancellor Otto von Bismarck linked Germany' s national security to collective, state action to ensure the health and social security of individual workers.119 This linkage was asserted more generally in the 20th century, by the two architects of today' s global security framework-Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt-who both accepted, as political liberals, the importance of building their own nations' security on a strong foundation of shared social solidarity and emphasised the importance to global security of ensuring that all people in all nations should live in freedom from fear and want.120",

Further, freedom from fear and want-the essence of human security-also means ensuring that all individuals have adequate protection against the financial risks of medical care, which in many countries remains a leading cause of poverty and threat to individual wellbeing.121",

A wider concept of health and human security in keeping with the original vision that created the UN Security Council is needed that acknowledges that global security is more easily achieved when, in all countries, all people can \"obtain the health services they need without suffering financial hardship when paying for them\".122 This is the goal of universal health coverage.",

Specifically, the financial protection objective embedded within universal health coverage implies that the burden of financing health care be distributed fairly across everyone in a society according to ability to pay, while protecting the sick. This scenario necessitates wealthier members of society contributing more than the poor. Global experience shows that maintenance of such an equitable system requires the state to play a major part in setting and enforcing laws compelling the healthy and wealthy members of society to subsidise services for the sick and the poor. As a result, universal health coverage can only be achieved with a heavy reliance on public financing mechanisms -in particular through general taxation and compulsory progressive social insurance systems. This reliance was one of the major findings of the recent Lancet Commission on investing in health, which advocated for increasing public financing to reach universal health coverage through \"progressive universalism\".123",

First, if we consider the emergence of some infectious diseases of global concern (for example, artemisinin-resistant malaria, SARS, and Ebola), they occurred in settings without universal health coverage where health systems were unable to perform effective public health functions and deliver essential medical services, including hospital care for the grievously ill. In the current Ebola crisis, the longstanding lack of access to basic primary care, laboratories with insufficient capacity, and shortage of existing hospital infrastructure to isolate and treat infected people left communities with little trust in the health system, families with no help to tend for their seriously ill members, and fuelled the spread of the epidemic and its resulting death toll.",

Additionally, the health security threat of non-communicable diseases cannot be mitigated without provision of horizontally integrated primary care that can prevent, diagnose, and manage a wide range of illnesses. Unless all countries have effective universal health coverage, populations will also be inclined to travel across borders to seek care, increasing the potential for infection to spread and posing social and economic burdens and possible threats to law and order in other nations. Indeed, Ebola has been seeded and reseeded in the three countries most affected by the current epidemic as people moved across borders in search of social support and health care.125",

This has been the case in China, where the architect of their recent health reforms suggested that his government' s main motivation in achieving universal health coverage had been to bring about \"a more harmonious society\".129",
