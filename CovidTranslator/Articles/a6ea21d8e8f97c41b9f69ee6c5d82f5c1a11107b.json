The mNGS assay has been validated in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) laboratory [4, 5] , and results are relayed to the treating clinical team(s) and reported in the patient's electronic medical record.",

Neurologic manifestations of HEV infection, including inflammatory polyradiculopathy, encephalitis, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, have been seen in 5.5% of cases [9] . The timing of neurological manifestations after HEV infection has not been well described, but ranged from 12-60 months in 1 review of 6 cases in immunosuppressed patients. In animal models, HEV is able to cross the blood-brain barrier, replicate in the central nervous system, and cause neuronal necrosis and myelin degeneration [10] .",

            "text": "Hepatitis E virus infection is infrequently considered as an infectious cause of meningoencephalitis and specific diagnostic testing is not routinely done, underscoring the benefit of an unbiased approach such as mNGS for pathogen detection [11] . Hepatitis E virus infection may be detected through serological testing, but concurrent blood and stool HEV RNA testing is recommended, especially in immunosuppressed patients [6] . Clinicians should consider HEV in the differential diagnosis for SOT or other immunosuppressed patients with unexplained hepatitis, particularly those taking calcineurin inhibitors [8] . The treatment of chronic HEV infection includes reduction in immunosuppression, enabling viral clearance in approximately 30% of SOT patients [12] . Ribavirin monotherapy has achieved sustained virologic response in approximately 85% of patients and was initiated in this patient [12] . New antivirals such as sofosbuvir may have a future role in treatment [13] . Notably, our patient appears to have contracted HEV from her donor. Supporting evidence includes the positive anti-HEV IgG/IgM testing of the donor's serum and the patient's persistent low-level transaminase elevations that began after transplant. Of only 2 published reports of donor-derived HEV transmission, 1 liver transplant recipient developed cirrhosis and death from septic shock within 15 months of transplantation, and 2 renal transplant recipients (with the same donor) developed cholestatic hepatitis at 9 and 11 months after transplantation [14, 15] . This is the first report of presumptive HEV transmission through lung transplantation. Transplant centers and clinicians should be aware of the potential for HEV infection in donors judged to be at elevated risk.",
