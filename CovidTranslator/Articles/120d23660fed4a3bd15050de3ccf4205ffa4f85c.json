Subsequent observations based upon seroepidemiological surveys and electron microscopy of fecal material verified that cheetahs were indeed capable of being infected by coronaviruses, which were antigenically related to coronaviruses affecting domestic cats, i.e. feline infectious peritonitis virus/feline enteric coronavirus. Coincident with the apparent increased susceptibility of the cheetah to infectious diseases, were observations that the cheetah was genetically unusual insofar as large amounts of enzyme-encoding loci were monomorphic, and that unrelated cheetahs were capable of accepting allogenic skin grafts. These data provided the basis for a hypothesis that the cheetah, through intensive inbreeding, had become more susceptible to viral infections as a result of genetic homogeneity.",

One of the primary reasons for this emphasis was the recent occurrence of a devastating epizootic of feline coronavirus infection (feline infectious peritonitis [FIP] ) in captive cheetahs in 1982-1983 [26, 29, 72] . Since that time, there have been other reports on the apparent susceptibility of the cheetah to infectious diseases with emphasis on FIP [-4, 10, 38, 62, 63, 93] . Since there are currently no vaccines available for control of FIP in either domestic or exotic cat populations it is essential that biologists, diagnosticians, and veterinarians be aware of the impact that this infection has upon the cheetah, so that appropriate management steps can be taken to minimize the chance for infection and thereby lessen the risk of fatal disease. The purpose of this review is to present desciptions of the various forms of coronaviral infections in the cheetah relying upon studies of both natural infections, as well as experimental infections in other species with coronaviruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), canine coronavirus (CCV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine, and bovine coronavirus (BCV) of neonatal calves [28, 36, 39, 49, 57, 60, 61, 75, 79, 92] .",

Prior to that time, the disease was referred to as feline systemic proliferative and exudative vasculitis [30, 40] , and later feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) [91] . Recognition of the first coronavirus associated with FIP in cats was determined by electron microscopy in 1970 [86] . Inasmuch as cell culture-adapted isolates of the FIP virus (FIPV) were not yet available, the disease condition was experimentally transmitted by the inoculation of liver homogenates from diseased cats into the peritoneal cavity of susceptible cats. During the period of experimental transmission of FIP by tissue homogenates, serologic assays were developed which utilized indirect immunofluorescence on cryostat sections of liver obtained from cats with clinical FIP [66] . Subsequent serologic studies relied upon cell culturegrown homologous virus, FIPV, or heterologous cross-reacting coronavirus strains, such as CCV and TGEV [25, 33, 42~44, 59, 66] .",

Since those initial reports on the divergent nature of feline coronaviruses and the designation of FIPV and FECV strains, there have been additional reports on the detection and/or isolation of feline coronaviruses [4, 66] . The spectrum of disease resulting from these various isolates is presented in Table 1 . Although there are marked phenotypic differences in terms of in vivo virulence, efforts to distinguish FECV strains from FIPV strains in vitro have not been successful [8, 31, 32, 85] . It is conceivable that molecular technology will reveal differences at the genomic level, which reflect variation in strain virulence or pathology [18, 19, 46, 7] . Diagnostic molecular procedures would be useful in the detection of cats that were shedding FIPV into the environment. However, if FIPV is the progeny of a random mutation from FECV, or a recombinant of two enteric coronaviruses, then the application would vary according to the frequency of these mutational events [51, 54, 66, 70, 78, 80, 90] .",

A common feature of the isolates was their reduced cytopathic effect (CPE) in CrFK cells and cytoplasmic immunofluorescence when stained with antisera to a strain of moderate virulence, FIPV UCD-1 ( Fig. 1 a, The cheetah virus has been maintained in cell culture as a persistent noncytolytic infection [27, 29] . However, infected cells do express periods of cytopathogenicity referred to as \"crisis periods\", but following each crisis, cells emerge and the infection is maintained. Assays for cell-free, virus have been hampered due to the low release of extracellular virus. Ultrastructural studies conducted on the cells persistently infected by the cheetah coronavirus have revealed the presence of virus particles in cytoplasmic vacuoles, but minimal virus at the cell surface [27] . This is in contrast to the high number of virus particles observed, both within virus-infected cells, as well as at the surface of cells with the cytopathogenic coronaviruses, FECV 79-1683 and FIPV 79-1146 [27] .",

This is further suggested by its cell-associated nature and the lack of cell fusion capability, which would indicate incomplete expression of the essential E2 protein (fusion protein) [21, 37, 39, 82] . This observation may be due to a partially defective virus [55] or to a virus which fails to mature properly due to the absence of a host-cell protease [39, 89] . The cheetah agent represents the least virulent in cell culture as compared with other feline coronaviruses (Table 1 ) except for FECV UCD, which has not yet been cultured in vitro, but must be maintained by passage through cats [66, 683. Enzymatic enhancement of coronavirus replication and expression of CPE in vitro have been reported for a number of different coronaviruses including BCV and TGEV [2, 13, 14, 58, 84] . The addition of low amounts of trypsin (5 Ixg/ml) to serum-free culture media enhances the CPE of the feline corona- viruses FIPV UCD-1 and FIPV UCD-4, and also appears to augment the expression of the cheetah coronavirus [27] . Studies on the effects of trypsin on various coronavirus strains, including FECV and FIPV, have suggested that trypsin-sensitive and trypsin-resistant phenotypes occur in nature [13, 58] . Those strains that are highly resistant have been hypothesized to survive longer in the gastrointestinal tract and therefore be infectious longer, both for the infected host, as well as for other susceptible animals in the population which come in contact with the shedding host [15, 16] .",

The macrophage appears to be one of the primary sites for FIPV replication in vivo and was demonstrated to be a source of virus in vitro prior to the isolation of viruses in conventional cell cultures [66] . Although definitive studies have not been reported yet with FIPV, it may be predicted that cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage are very important in conferring resistance to infection, and in subsequent immune reactions of the processed FIPV antigens with the B-and T-cell populations. Coronaviral infection of the macrophage has been reported to be one of the major criteria for distinguishing resistance and susceptibility in mice with the murine coronavirus, MHV [3, 5, 6, 9, 11, 20, 22, 52, 53] .

Serum from cats with high IFA antibody titers has been demonstrated to enhance the pathogenesis of FIPV when passively administered to cats six hours prior to virus inoculation [66] . The role of antibody in the pathogenesis of FIP has been controversial, but is not without precedent since there are several viral infections which have been documented to have an immune-mediated disease sequelae. These include dengue fever of humans [17, 65, 87] , and yellow fever virus [35] . The mechanism(s) of antibody-mediated enhancement may take the form of non-neutralizing antibodies, enhancing antibodies, or blocking antibodies (bind to/or block T-cell receptors) [see 73 for review]. A likely explanation is that certain strains of feline coronavirus, i.e., FIPV variants or mutants [51, 78, 80, 90] , infect and replicate in macrphage cells, perhaps altering normal B-and T-cell interactions. The B-cell response is polyclonal and antibodies that are formed appear to detect all the major viral proteins as determined by Western blot techniques [38] . Certain types of these antibodies may serve as enhancing antibodies in terms of increased viral uptake and replication within macrophages, which are subsequently spread throughout the body.",

Impairment of the T-cell response, such as may occur during concurrent viral infection with either feline panleukopenia virus or feline leukemia virus, appears to predispose cats to FIP [66, 70, Evermann, unpublished observation]. Without T-cell surveillance of virus-infected macrophages, cell-associated viremia occurs and dispersal of virus occurs throughout the body [88] . The actual mechanism(s) of FIPV-induced tissue damage is being investigated, but may be a combination of inflammatory response with neutrophils imparting tissue damage alone or in combination with cytotoxic T cells attempting to rid tissues of virus-infected macrophages [23] . The basic lesions in FIP are a result of the cat's immune response producing large quantities of antibodies and the formation of immune complexes which are subsequently deposited within the vessels of the serosa [41, 44, 66, 87, 88] . Persistence of viral antigens in the serosal blood vessels provokes a hypersensitivity reaction with the migration and infiltration of mononuclear cells into vessel adventitia and media, resulting in severe vascular damage [87, 88] . The outcome from the vessel damage usually includes a serous effusion and accumulation of fluid in the major body cavities. This type of immune response is characteristic of a type III hypersensitivity reaction [44, 66, 87, 88] .",

More recently, the cheetah has been shown to be genetically unusual insofar as large amounts of enzyme-encoding loci are monomorphic in natural populations [63, 64, 94] . This observation, coupled with the extraordinary finding that unrelated cheetahs would immunologically accept allogenic skin grafts, was interpreted in the context of a hypothesis that the cheetah had undergone intensive inbreeding in its recent natural history [63] . Such a situation would have significant effect upon the immune defenses against microbial pathogens. By analogy to other species, natural populations have multiple loci which are polymorphic for functions which influence the outcome of viral-induced disease outbreaks [-62] . Notable amongst such genes are those forming the major histocompatibility complex, whose gene products function directly in monitoring immune response to viral infections [3, 5, 6, 94] . The genetic homogeneity of the cheetah may be an important contributing factor in the increased susceptibility of the species to viral infections, such as FIPV and feline herpesvirus [26, 71, 72] .",

In an effort to determine the prevalence of feline coronavirus infection in cheetahs, a serologic survey and an electron microscopic analysis were conducted on captive and wild-caught cheetahs [38] . The serological results from captive cheetahs in 14 zoologic parks in North America (Table2) indicated that 25 of 89 (28%) captive cheetahs were seropositive to feline coronavirus by IFA (group-specific serology test). These results were higher than those of captive cheetahs located in southern Africa and Europe, but similar to captive cheetahs in eastern Africa as well as to wild-caught cheetahs ( Table 3 ). The serologic results indicated that the cheetahs were being infected by a virus which was antigenically related to the feline coronavirus group, and that there was a comparable risk of acquiring infection whether ",

The seroprevalence of feline coronavirus infection in cheetahs in captivity, both in North America and Africa, indicates that the virus is transmitted with equal frequency.
