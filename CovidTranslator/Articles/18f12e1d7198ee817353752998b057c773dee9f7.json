They are predominantly triggered by infection and up to 64% of exacerbations are associated with colds. 2 The most common respiratory virus detected in the airways at exacerbation is human rhinovirus (HRV), which using molecular techniques has been identifi ed as present in up to 60% of respiratory virus-associated exacerbations. 2, 3 Background: Human rhinovirus (HRV) is the most frequent virus associated with COPD exacerbations. Viral infections increase exacerbation severity and likelihood of hospitalization. As ease of sampling blood makes serum a more practical marker than sputum, we investigated whether changes in serum interferon-g -inducible protein 10 (IP-10) from baseline to exacerbation were higher in airway HRV-positive exacerbations and whether IP-10 levels related to HRV load. Methods: One hundred thirty-six patients with COPD and 70 controls were included over 2 years and 72 exacerbations sampled. HRV positivity and load were determined by reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction in nasopharyngeal swabs and/or sputum at baseline and exacerbation. IP-10 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum and compared with HRV load.",

Although there are airway and blood markers that increase from baseline to exacerbation, they are not specifi c. There is no systemic biomarker that can be used as a marker of airway HRV positivity in COPD. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to assess the use of serum IP-10 as a marker of airway HRV positivity at exacerbation and to assess the relationship between serum IP-10 and airway HRV load.

Following extensive discussion in our group, we chose a very sensitive cutoff of 1 pfu/mL for HRV detection 17 for this exploratory analysis. None of the negative water controls were positive at this level; however, there was some cross reactivity with RSV and the standard curve was extrapolated to reach this point. These low levels were only detected at baseline, predominantly in NPS samples, and were not used in the exacerbation ROC analysis. This very sensitive cutoff may account for the greater proportion of asymptomatic HRV positivity found at baseline in both the control population and patients with based on the difference in HRV load between baseline and exacerbation ( Fig 6 ) . We used sputum samples only as HRV load in NPS did not correlate with sputum load or IP-10. We chose a log 10 HRV load value of 2.24, which corresponds to 175 pfu/mL as this was higher than the upper limit of the IQR for the baseline samples but less than that for the exacerbation samples. We would suggest that the presence of HRV at a load \u0546 175 pfu/mL at exacerbation indicates that HRV is the cause of that exacerbation and anything below this level, although HRV is present, does not cause symptoms of exacerbation or trigger much of an infl ammatory response. We based our ROC analysis on this cutoff for HRV using all sputum samples (baseline and exacerbation, HRV positive and negative) and the presence of cold symptoms on the day of visit. The AUC for IP-10 alone was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.65-0.91). Using the presence of coryzal symptoms alone, the AUC was 0.66 (0.51-0.82). Using the combination of IP-10 and coryzal symptoms the AUC was 0.82 (0.74-0.90) ( Figs 6, 7 ) . Thus by measuring IP-10 in the blood in the presence of a coryzal symptom at exacerbation, the likelihood of HRV infection can be determined. Applying a cutoff of IP-10 in the blood of 260 pg/mL in the presence of cold symptoms would be 80% specifi c and 67% sensitive for a HRV exacerbation.",

Serum IP-10 has previously been shown to increase in virustriggered acute asthma exacerbations, 19 and we have now shown that in COPD exacerbations, sputum HRV load determined by quantitative RT-PCR correlates with IP-10 levels in the blood. Although HRV infection in most individuals is mild and self-limiting, in patients with COPD viral infection not only triggers exacerbations but increases the severity of the exacerbation, lengthens recovery time, 4 and increases the likelihood of hospitalization. 6 Thus serum IP-10 may be a useful biomarker to identify a patient for early intervention, either with standard exacerbation therapy 20, 21 or future novel 22 antiviral agents. 23, 24 This study shows that sputum HRV load correlated with serum IP-10 at exacerbation, and thus IP-10 may be useful in detecting the presence of HRV and monitoring HRV exacerbation length and response to treatment. Currently there are no good markers of exacerbation severity and HRV causes more severe exacerbations than virus-negative exacerbations. 25 Ease of sampling blood makes serum IP-10 a more practical marker than a sputum marker. Further work is required COPD compared with other studies. 17 Other studies have used different primers and probes and have been designed to detect fewer strains of HRV. Both of these factors will lead to lower detection rates. Our HRV PCR was designed to detect as many different strains of HRV as possible and we sampled most of our baselines in the spring and autumn when HRV is most prevalent.",

Viruses circulate all year round, and it is likely that patients with COPD acquire virus frequently, possibly only at low levels; however, only some strains of HRV demonstrate pathogenicity. With increasingly sensitive methods of viral detection available, the use of viral load in determining the signifi cance of the presence of virus is increasingly common. We used these data to suggest a cutoff for viral load being signifi cant at exacerbation (ie, most likely causing the exacerbation). As symptoms are integral to the defi nition of a COPD exacerbation, 1 and coryzal symptoms are a putative marker of virus positivity, it is reasonable to combine the presence of coryzal symptoms with IP-10 as a predictor of HRV positivity. The current data from the ROC analysis presented indicate that serum IP-10 of \u0546 260 pg/mL and the presence of a cold symptom indicates an HRV exacerbation.",

In tissue culture IP-10 has been shown to increase in the presence of infl uenza virus, 29 and in mice IP-10 levels increase in response to RSV, 30 but this has not been confi rmed in vivo . Although it is possible other viruses not tested for may infl uence IP-10, we did not fi nd an increase in IP-10 in the presence of coryzal symptoms (a marker of viral infection) when HRV was not detected. Cold illnesses are usually caused by respiratory viruses 31 and we found that cold-associated exacerbations that were negative for HRV did not have increased serum IP-10 levels. This strengthens the case for IP-10 as a biomarker of HRV infection in the airway at exacerbation.",
