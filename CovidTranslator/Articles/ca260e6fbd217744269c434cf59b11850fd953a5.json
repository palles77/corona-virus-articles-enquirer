            "text": "Background: Priority setting in healthcare is a key determinant of health system performance. However, there is no widely accepted priority setting evaluation framework. We reviewed literature with the aim of developing and proposing a framework for the evaluation of macro and meso level healthcare priority setting practices. Methods: We systematically searched Econlit, PubMed, CINAHL, and EBSCOhost databases and supplemented this with searches in Google Scholar, relevant websites and reference lists of relevant papers. A total of 31 papers on evaluation of priority setting were identified. These were supplemented by broader theoretical literature related to evaluation of priority setting. A conceptual review of selected papers was undertaken. Results: Based on a synthesis of the selected literature, we propose an evaluative framework that requires that priority setting practices at the macro and meso levels of the health system meet the following conditions: (1) Priority setting decisions should incorporate both efficiency and equity considerations as well as the following outcomes; (a) Stakeholder satisfaction, (b) Stakeholder understanding, (c) Shifted priorities (reallocation of resources), and (d) Implementation of decisions. (2) Priority setting processes should also meet the procedural conditions of (a) Stakeholder engagement, (b) Stakeholder empowerment, (c) Transparency, (d) Use of evidence, (e) Revisions, (f) Enforcement, and (g) Being grounded on community values. Conclusion: Available frameworks for the evaluation of priority setting are mostly grounded on procedural requirements, while few have included outcome requirements. There is, however, increasing recognition of the need to incorporate both consequential and procedural considerations in priority setting practices. In this review, we adapt an integrative approach to develop and propose a framework for the evaluation of priority setting practices at the macro and meso levels that draws from these complementary schools of thought.",

            "text": "Despite recognition of the importance of priority setting in healthcare, priority setting exercises in most settings are ad hoc rather than systematic. 1, 2 This has led to calls for strategies to improve priority setting practices in healthcare. 3, 4 Essential to improving priority setting practices is having a sense of direction; a standard to be aimed for, and against which to evaluate performance. The term evaluation is used here to refer to the systematic process whereby data are collected and analyzed to inform a judgment of worth or merit about an evaluand such as a process, programme or policy. 5 Findings from evaluations find utility in improving decision-making, accountability, and resource allocation. 6 An evaluation framework can provide concrete guidance to priority setting processes, highlight specific opportunities for improvement and determine whether priority setting practice has improved. 6 However, there is no widely accepted priority setting evaluation framework, with challenges including little agreement on what counts as priority setting success, 7, 8 and different views on the underlying values that should be espoused in priority setting exercises. In this paper, we conducted an interpretive thematic review of theoretical and empirical literature on and related to the evaluation of priority setting to develop a framework for the evaluation of priority setting practice at the macro (national) and meso (decentralized health systems and health facilities such as hospitals) levels. We aim to contribute to the relatively scarce literature and debate on frameworks for the evaluation of priority setting in healthcare.",

This second literature was necessitated by the observation that there is a dearth of literature on the evaluation of priority setting. For the first set of literature, we searched in EBSCOhost, PubMed, CINAHL, and Econlit databases, as well as Google Scholar using the following key words: 'evaluation' or 'evaluate' or 'success' or 'successful' and 'rationing' or 'planning' or 'priority setting' or 'health care rationing' or 'strategic planning' or 'decision making' or 'resource allocation' or 'budgeting' or 'health technology assessment. ' We carried out a manual search for relevant papers in the reference lists of selected papers. We then reviewed the titles and abstracts and full texts of identified papers to decide on final inclusion. We included papers that described and/or applied an evaluative framework for priority setting in healthcare and were written in the English language. Papers that did not meet these criteria were excluded. We did not apply any other exclusion criteria. For the second set of literature we searched for theoretical literature on related concepts such as ethics, justice, deliberative democracy and procedural justice in healthcare. These concepts were identified from reading the papers identified in the first step. The following key words were used in the second step: 'ethics' or 'ethical' or 'accountability for reasonableness' or 'justice' or 'just' or 'procedural justice' or 'deliberative democracy' and 'rationing' or 'priority setting' or 'health care rationing' or 'decision making' or 'planning' or 'resource allocation' or 'strategic planning' or 'budgeting' or 'health technology assessment. ' The selection of papers to include in the review was purposive rather than exhaustive because our aim was conceptual interpretation rather than prediction. 9 It was therefore not necessary to locate every available paper given that the interpretations of our conceptual synthesis would not change if for example 10 rather than 5 papers containing the same concept were included, but rather would depend on the range of concepts found in the papers, their context, and whether they are in agreement or not. The number of papers reviewed was therefore dependent on 'conceptual saturation. ' 9 Synthesis of Obtained Literature We conducted a thematic review of theoretical and empirical literature on and related to the evaluation of priority setting. Thematic review involves the identification of prominent or recurrent themes in the literature, and summarizing the findings of different papers under thematic headings. 9, 10 We began with reading the selected papers, gradually identifying recurring ideas and concepts. We then constructed themes from these emergent concepts and ideas in an interpretive stage of the analysis that sought to integrate findings from across the papers into a coherent theoretical framework comprising a network of constructs and the relationships between them. 11 Our approach to the thematic review is therefore interpretive rather than descriptive, and draws from \"line of argument\" approaches used in meta-ethnography 12 and critical interpretive synthesis. 11 This approach was applied to both sets of literature selected for this review.",

            "text": "Consequential approaches to priority setting prescribe the use of a set of rational rules to set priorities and allocate resources in healthcare. Given that priority setting is a complex and value laden process, consensus on rational rules has been problematic. 2 Despite this, allocative efficiency and equity feature prominently in normative literature as being relevant in the distribution of scarce healthcare resources. 14, 15 Allocative efficiency is achieved when resources are allocated so as to maximize the welfare of the community. 16 Two main tools have been used to allocate resources-based on economic criteria. [45] [46] [47] The first, cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) (which in this review shall subsequently be used to refer to both costutility and cost-effectiveness analyses as is common practice in literature) has been used to allocate resources in both developing and developed countries. 48 The second economic tool is programme budgeting and marginal analysis (PBMA), a systematic priority setting framework that aims to help decision-makers to identify the most efficient use of available resources while taking into consideration the opportunity costs of choices. 49, 50 However, the employment of allocative efficiency as the sole principle for priority setting could result in undesired outcomes. 45, 51 For example, allocatively efficient decisions would result in the treatment of the elderly having less preference because of their lower life-expectancy or the disabled given less preference because they have a lower capacity to benefit from treatment. Further, the current methods used to assess efficiency in healthcare resource allocation, such as CEA, employ simple aggregative algorithms that can result in undesired outcomes. 14, 45 The pitfalls of such aggregation rules are best exemplified by the case of the initial ranking lists of the Oregon Health Services Commission where tooth capping was found to be more cost effective than appendectomy, and was therefore given higher priority. 51 There is significant consensus therefore that while maximizing outcomes is an important concern in allocating resources, it is also important that scarce resources are distributed equitably. 14, 45 There is no consensus in literature however on the conceptualization of equity in allocation of healthcare resources. There is, however, general agreement that, in publicly-funded healthcare systems, individuals or groups of individuals (patient groups) should make healthcare payments based on their ability to pay and receive healthcare benefits based on their healthcare needs. 52 Norheim and colleagues 14 have also proposed that resource allocation practices in healthcare should have a special concern for the worst off and should not be based on simple aggregation rules. The prominence given to allocative efficiency and equity in normative literature on consequential principles of priority setting is however not reflected in empirical literature. Of the 31 papers in the first set of literature, only 2 prescribed the use of efficiency, while none prescribed the use of equity as a principle for the evaluation of priority setting. Of the two that prescribed the use of efficiency, none conceptualized it as allocative efficiency. Further, a range of outcome measures were used to evaluate priority setting process across different settings. The most commonly proposed outcomes (or consequences) of healthcare priority setting in the first set of reviewed literature are stakeholder satisfaction with the process, improvement in stakeholder understanding of the process, and that priority setting exercises result in reallocation (shifting) of resources ( Table 3 ). The first two underline the recognition of the importance of stakeholders to not only accept or approve the adopted priority setting process, but also understand it. The requirement for the shifting of resources in essence means that priority setting procedures should be responsive to the dynamic environment of changing healthcare needs rather than perpetrate static historic considerations. It has also been proposed that priority setting procedures should reflect public values and/or gain public acceptance. 6, 24 Other priority setting outcomes that have been used to assess healthcare priority setting practices are the extent to which they further the achievement of the goals of the healthcare organization, 39 the extent to which decisions are implemented, 39 the extent to which decisions are based on evidence, 6 improvements in decision-making quality and health outcomes. 6, 7, 36 Procedural Measures of Priority Setting Of the 31 papers selected in the first set of literature, 30 prescribe a range of procedural conditions for evaluation of priority setting practices. Based on these papers and on the broader literature selected in the second set of literature, procedural conditions that have received significant attention both in theory and practice include wider stakeholder engagement, empowerment of stakeholders, provisions for revisions of decisions, transparency of procedures, the use of relevant criteria, and the use of good quality evidence/ information (Table 3 ). Other aspects of procedures that have been considered important include consistency in decision-making and enforcement of decisions. Even though some of these procedural measures appear to overlap with consequentialist rules, the distinction lies in where value is attached: procedural approaches value procedures as an end in itself, while consequentialist approaches value procedures to the extent that they are instrumental in achieving desired outcomes. Procedural approaches to priority setting have drawn significantly from principles of deliberative democracy and are aimed at achieving procedural fairness. Deliberative democracy is a type of democracy where deliberation is central to decision-making. 53 This differs from aggregative democracy where voting is key. Both theoretical and empirical literature on priority setting processes reveals an emphasis on deliberation and public 54 Habermas argues for free and un-coerced discussions among all stakeholders in collaborative decision-making processes. Habermas specifies four conditions to be met for the ideal speech situation to be achieved namely (1) That each subject should be allowed to participate in deliberation, (2) Each subject should be allowed to question presented proposals, (3) Each subject should be allowed to introduce their proposal into the deliberations, and (4) Each subject should be allowed to express their wishes, needs and attitudes. 54 Building on Habermas's concepts, Renn and Webler developed an evaluative framework for deliberative processes that is grounded on a normative theory of public participation. 55, 56 In their evaluative framework, Renn and Webler propose that deliberative processes should be judged on 2 meta-principles namely fairness and competence. 56 The fairness principle is met if all stakeholders are provided with equal opportunities to engage and contribute to deliberations. 56 These aspects include developing procedural rules, agenda setting, selecting the information and expertise that will be used in decisionmaking and assessing the validity of information. 56 The competence principle is met if the right understanding and knowledge of the issues is achieved by the use and appropriate interpretation of information. 56 The importance of access and use of quality information and evidence is therefore important. More recently, the Renn and Webler framework together with later work by Beierle, 57 was adopted by Abelson and colleagues 58 to develop an evaluative framework for deliberative processes, that is comprised of three key procedural components namely: (1) the structure of the procedures (reasonable, legitimate, fair and responsive), (2) representation, and (3) the use of information.",

Related to these ideas, Gutmann and Thompson 61 have proposed 3 principles of deliberative democratic processes namely publicity, accountability and reciprocity. Publicity is said to be achieved when the rationales for decision-making are made explicit and publicly available. Accountability is achieved when decision-makers are held responsible for their decisions, such that it minimizes fraud and bias, while reciprocity is achieved when the structure of procedures is such that everyone respects and listens to each other's views and ideas during decision-making. For this to happen, they argue, an environment that encourages participation has to be created. Drawing from deliberative democratic principles, a framework that has gained prominence in evaluating the priority setting process is the ethical framework Accountability for reasonableness (AFR). 3, 62 AFR was the framework of choice for 21 of the 31 papers selected by this review. AFR relies on ''fair deliberative procedures that yield a range of acceptable answers. '' 63 AFR proposes that a fair and legitimate decisionmaking process should meet the following 4 conditions 63 ; (1) Relevance, (2) Publicity, (3) Revisions, and (4) Enforcement.",

Of the 31 papers selected in the first set of literature, 30 included the community as part of the relevant range of stakeholders that should be included in priority setting processes (data not shown). The participation of the public in priority setting processes has not only been shown to be minimal, but has also generated significant debate. 64 Debating points include how public engagement should be obtained, when it should be sought, and how public views should be incorporated in decision-making. It has been proposed that priority setting should be based on the values of the community. 65, 66 Health organizations are seen as social organizations that exist to, among others, meet society's needs. [65] [66] [67] Under the communitarian claims approach, the citizen is required to \"set the stage\" for policy-makers to allocate resources by determining the procedural rules that policy-makers are expected to play by. 66 The relationship between citizens and policy-makers is here considered to be a principal-agent relationship at a social level. 65 Here citizens, who are assumed to have limited capacity to make technical healthcare decisions entrust this responsibility to healthcare decision-makers. 68 Rowe and Frewer 69 have proposed a framework to assess the degree of public participation in decision-making which has three participation levels namely: (1) Communication, (2) Consultation, and (3) Participation. In communication, information is passed from the decision-maker to the public such as through newspaper advertisements or announcements on notice boards. In consultation, information is passed from the public to the decision-maker without dialogue or interaction such as through client surveys or suggestion boxes. 69 In participation, there is negotiation and dialogue between decision-makers and the public. 69 Examples of participation methods include citizen juries or planning cells. Attempts at incorporating public participation methods in healthcare decision-making have experienced a number of challenges. It has been argued that the public is unlikely to be objective especially on issues that directly affect them. 64 It has also been argued that the public might not be competent to contribute to technical debates on healthcare decisionmaking. 34 It has also been shown that the empowerment of the public is not automatic and that a number of factors come into play. For example, in Tanzania, similar to most other settings, effective participation of the public in priority setting decisions was influenced by gender, wealth, ethnicity and education. 42 Members of the public who were male, more educated, and wealthier or shared ethnicity with decisionmakers were more empowered in decision-making spaces.",

            "text": "A number of recurrent concepts, that are considered critical in priority setting processes, can be drawn from the general literature on priority setting and evaluative frameworks. First, priority setting is necessitated, and is an attempt to solve the fundamental economic problem of scarcity and choice. 45, 50 Frameworks for priority setting practice, and indeed their evaluation should therefore consider how best to achieve health system goals, given scarce resources. 45 This essentially entails making choices such that desired outputs are maximized within the available resources. The choice of economic tools for priority setting is, however, dependent on, among others, the level of priority setting activity. For example, while CEA is more feasible at the national level, it might not be practical at the regional or hospital level. Challenges would include the limited technical capacity and availability of data required for these analyses. 45 It is perhaps more feasible to use methods such as considering affordability alongside effectiveness and the budget impact of choices at lower levels of the health system (such as hospitals). Second, the goal of maximizing desired outcomes must be traded-off against equity. Priority setting exercises in healthcare organizations should aim at achieving an appropriate balance between maximizing intended outcomes for a given resource level while considering equity. 14, 45 To achieve equity, the distribution of resources should be determined by needs rather than other factors such as ability to pay, favouritism or political consideration. Further, resource allocation should demonstrate a special concern for the worse off. 14 The worse off can either be patient groups in a worse medical condition right now (eg, medical emergencies), or, alternatively, the ones whose complete life in terms of health will be worse if not treated now. The worse off should also include vulnerable patient groups. Vulnerability is often context dependent but could include groups such as the disabled, the elderly, children and women. Also, allocation should not be based on simple aggregating rules.",

While it is generally desirable to assess outcomes, attributing them to priority setting practices, especially in the short term, is likely to be problematic given that priority setting is a highly complex social process. Measures such as the achievement of health system/organizational goals and improvement of health outcomes cannot be easily attributed to specified priority setting activities except perhaps over the long run. Such measures would pose significant measurement challenges when adopted as measures for priority setting success. There is therefore a need for intermediate measures of outcomes that can be easily attributed to specified priority setting activities. Based on this, and on the frequency of recommendation from literature, we propose the following intermediate outcomes to be considered in the evaluation of priority setting practices:",

Forth, given that priority setting entails adjudication over competing wants among groups of interested parties, procedural justice is a desired goal. 33 We propose the following seven procedural conditions as key in evaluating priority setting process: (1) Stakeholder involvement; literature strongly suggests that policy-making processes and specifically priority setting processes are deemed to be fair and legitimate partly when the relevant stakeholders are effectively involved in the process. Specifically for priority setting, this relevant range of stakeholders include administrators/health managers, front line practitioners, patients and the community. As discussed previously however, the types of stakeholders that participate and the nature of participation is dependent on a number of considerations including the level of decision-making and the type of decision. (2) Empowerment; that the engagement of stakeholders should be such that they have the power to contribute to and influence decisions. Given the existence of power differences among actors in healthcare organizations, 25 mechanisms should be there to minimize the effect of this power difference. These include for example giving each stakeholder equal opportunities to participate at different stages of the decision-making process such as establishing procedural rules, agenda setting, selecting the expertise and information to inform the process and providing an assessment of the validity of information, clearly defining and enshrining the role of the each stakeholder in priority setting rules and guidelines, ensuring accessibility of relevant information to each stakeholder to reduce information asymmetries and ongoing rather than one off or infrequent engagement of stakeholders since it has been shown that ongoing engagement builds trust over time.

For example, mechanisms that work in settings where individualism and equality are espoused are unlikely to work where society is characterized by hierarchy and interdependence. 71 Similarly, settings characterized by sharp divisions based on wealth, ethnicity, power, and gender would also require different participation mechanisms compared to settings with less divisions. Further, community engagement mechanisms will also depend on the level of priority setting activity. While survey methods may find utility in eliciting community views at the national level, they might not be cost-effective or practical at the regional or hospital level. Similarly, it is perhaps more feasible to form decision-making committees that include community representatives at the regional or hospital level than at the national level. The types of decisions also influence the choice of community engagement mechanisms. Further, more \"generic\" decisions such as principles for decision-making in hospitals lend themselves better to community involvement compared to more specific and or/technical decisions such as selection of medicines to be included in the formulary list. We propose that priority setting activities should incorporate participatory community engagement mechanisms rather than limit themselves to less interactive mechanisms such as one way communication. Examples include the incorporation of community members in hospital planning committees, the use of citizen juries 72 and planning cells. 58 While critics of community involvement in decision-making point out that community members lack understanding of technical issues and are hence incapable of meaningful contribution, 34 we argue that the role of the community is not to directly contribute technical solutions, but rather to provide \"metarules\" or generic principles that guide decision-making . 65, 66 For example, the community is capable of providing meaningful input in eliciting the relative importance of principles such as severity of disease, efficiency and procedural conditions of priority setting.",

It is unlikely that the consequential rules and procedural conditions proposed bear equal weight. Also, a major weakness of literature on evaluation of priority setting is their failure to engage with and incorporate evaluation theory. 5 This weakness is indeed reflected in our proposed framework given that it is based on a synthesis of existing literature. Further work should look at the practical applicability of these conditions by relevant stakeholders in priority setting processes and their relative importance as well as explore the incorporation of evaluation theory. An overarching thesis of our framework is that priority setting practice should be guided by community values. We have anchored our proposed framework on this communitarian claims school of thought based on our belief that health organizations are social organizations that exist to serve citizens. What the communities need, and how this should be delivered to them should rightly come from the citizens themselves.",
