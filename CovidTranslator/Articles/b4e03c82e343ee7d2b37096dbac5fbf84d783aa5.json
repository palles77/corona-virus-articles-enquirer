            "text": "RNA pseudoknots are structural elements that participate in a variety of biological processes. At \u00c01 ribosomal frameshifting sites, several types of pseudoknot have been identi\u00aeed which differ in their organisation and functionality. The pseudoknot found in infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is typical of those that possess a long stem 1 of 11-12 bp and a long loop 2 (30-164 nt). A second group of pseudoknots are distinguishable that contain stems of only 5 to 7 bp and shorter loops. The NMR structure of one such pseudoknot, that of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), has revealed that it is kinked at the stem 1-stem 2 junction, and that this kinked conformation is essential for ef\u00aecient frameshifting. We recently investigated the effect on frameshifting of modulating stem 1 length and stability in IBV-based pseudoknots, and found that a stem 1 with at least 11 bp was needed for ef\u00aecient frameshifting. Here, we describe the sequence manipulations that are necessary to bypass the requirement for an 11 bp stem 1 and to convert a short non-functional IBV-derived pseudoknot into a highly ef\u00aecient, kinked frameshifter pseudoknot. Simple insertion of an adenine residue at the stem 1-stem 2 junction (an essential feature of a kinked pseudoknot) was not suf\u00aecient to create a functional pseudoknot. An additional change was needed: ef\u00aecient frameshifting was recovered only when the last nucleotide of loop 2 was changed from a G to an A. The requirement for an A at the end of loop 2 is consistent with a loop-helix contact similar to those described in other RNA tertiary structures. A mutational analysis of both partners of the proposed interaction, the loop 2 terminal adenine residue and two G \u00c1C pairs near the top of stem 1, revealed that the interaction was essential for ef\u00aecient frameshifting. The speci\u00aec requirement for a 3 H -terminal A residue was lost when loop 2 was increased from 8 to 14 nt, suggesting that the loop-helix contact may be required only in those pseudoknots with a short loop 2.",

Pseudoknots were \u00aerst recognised experimentally from studies of the folding of the 3 H -end of turnip yellow mosaic virus RNA (TYMV; Rietveld et al., 1982) and since this time have been found in virtually all classes of RNA, including ribosomal RNAs, catalytic and self-splicing RNAs and messenger RNAs (reviewed by ten Dam et al., 1992) . Several pseudoknots have been described that play a role in protein biosynthesis.

The IBV pseudoknot is of the hairpin-type (ten Dam et al., 1992) and is thought to possess coaxially stacked stems of 11 bp (stem 1, S1) and 6 bp (stem 2, S2) connected by singlestranded loops of 2 nt (loop 1, L1) and 32 nt (loop 2, L2). The structure of the IBV pseudoknot is representative of those pseudoknots that are present at the frameshift sites of the corona-, toro-and arteriviruses which possess a long S1 of 11-12 bp and usually a long L2 (30-164 nt). A second group of pseudoknots contain stems of 5 to 7 bp and shorter loops (ten Dam et al. 1990; Brierley, 1995) . These pseudoknots are typi\u00aeed by those present at the frameshift sites of simian retrovirus 1 gag-pro (SRV-1; ten Dam et al., 1994) and the retrovirus mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) gag-pro (Chen et al., 1995) . The threedimensional (3D) structure of a functional variant of the MMTV pseudoknot (VPK) has been determined by NMR . This pseudoknot is bent at the S1-S2 junction with an intervening unpaired adenosine stacking between the two stems. The bent conformation is essential for ef\u00aecient frameshifting Chen et al., 1996; Kang & Tinoco, 1997) and may re\u00afect a requirement for a structuredependent interaction between a component of the translation apparatus and the pseudoknot.",

We found that ef\u00aecient frameshifting depended upon the presence of a minimum of 11 bp; pseudoknots with a shorter S1 (from 4 to 10 bp) were either non-functional or had a reduced frameshift ef\u00aeciency. The inability of these shorter pseudoknots to stimulate frameshifting is not fully understood, but it seemed likely that those with an S1 length of 5 or 6 bp could be functionally restored by inclusion of an intercalating A residue between S1 and S2, creating a kinked pseudoknot similar to those discussed above.",

Based on a possible structural analogy with the TYMV pseudoknot (Kolk et al., 1998) , we decided to change the last base of L2 from a G to an A residue. The TYMV structure, which is not associated with a frameshift signal, is stabilised by a loop to helix triple interaction between an adenine residue at the 3 H -end of L2 and the minor groove of S1, and it was possible therefore that a similar interaction would be important in some frameshifter pseudoknots. To test this, a variant of pKA5 with an intercalated A residue was modi\u00aeed by changing the 3 H -terminal base of L2 (the putative L2 donor base). The results were striking in that the presence of an A residue at the end of L2 generated a highly ef\u00aecient frameshifter pseudoknot (KA-A, 31 %). This observation was consistent with a requirement for an interaction between the L2 terminal A and the minor groove of S1. Further support for this model was obtained from the translational properties of mutants with alterations in S1, the putative loop acceptor region. Reversing the orientation of two G \u00c1C base-pair near the top of S1, a change predicted to interfere with a loophelix contact, decreased frameshifting to about 9 %. The speci\u00aec requirement for an A at the end of L2 was not seen in pseudoknots with a longer L2, however, suggesting that the loop-helix contact may be important only in those pseudoknots with a short L2.",

Two of the shorter constructs, pKA3 (5 bp S1) and pKA5 (6 bp S1), were the starting point for the present analysis and are shown in Figures 1 and 3 . The pKA3 construct ( Figure 1 ) is a frameshift reporter construct containing a short IBV-based pseudoknot cloned into the in\u00afuenza A/PR8/34 gene (Young et al., 1983 ) at a unique BglII site. The position of the pseudoknot in this construct is just upstream of a region of the PB2 gene where signi\u00aecant lengths of open reading frame are present in all three frames. A frameshift into any one of these frames generates a product with a characteristic size (22, 28 or 85 kDa). This property was important for the analysis described here, since we wished to introduce single or pairs of nucleotides into the pseudoknot, which would change the exit phase of \u00c01 frameshifted ribosomes. For pKA3-derived plasmids, ribosomes which terminate without frameshifting synthesise a 19 kDa non-frameshifted species. Ribosomes which undergo \u00c01 frameshifting at the slippery sequence continue translation to produce a \u00c01 frameshift product whose size is 22 kDa, 28 kDa or 85 kDa depending upon the exit reading frame, which is determined by the number of nucleotides introduced into S1.",

The most likely explanation for the functional de\u00aecit of pKA3 and pKA5 was thus their lack of such an unpaired A at the stem-stem junction, and we suspected that they could be rendered functional by providing this base.

In this RNA, L2 crosses the S1 minor groove and interacts with the opposing helix, in particular through hydrogen bonds with a loop terminal adenosine (A35). This residue's base moiety is tilted to an angle of about 90 with respect to the plane of the opposing base-pairs (Figure 2 ), which allows it to hydrogen bond with the minor groove faces of both G30 and G31 (Table 2) . Signi\u00aecantly, structural constraints imposed by the main-chain of L2 seem to limit the base that can provide the required hydrogen bond donor/acceptor pro\u00aele to an adenine (Kolk et al., 1998) . Inspection of the 3D structure of the VPK frameshifter pseudoknot determined by NMR revealed an L2 adenine residue, A27, that faces the S2 minor groove ( Figure 2 , Table 2 ). This base, like A35 of TYMV, is tilted with respect to the plane of opposing base-pairs, except that it is positioned over the middle of the minor groove rather than at one side, allowing it to contact bases on both strands of the helix. Since both interactions seem to require a functionality that can only be provided by an adenine residue, we decided to change G29 of pKA-G to an A (construct pKA-A). As can be seen in Figure 3 , frameshifting increased sixfold to 31 % in response to this modi\u00aecation. However, changing G29 to U or C did not stimulate frameshifting markedly (6 %, pKA-C; 10 %, pKA-U), highlighting the speci\u00aec requirement for an adenine residue at this position, consistent with the loop-helix interaction proposed above.",

Sequence changes are given with respect to pKA3 and the base changes are shown in the context of their domain as lowercase bold letters (d, deletion). The slippery sequence, loop 1 and intercalating base are indicated by SS, L1 and INT respectively. The 3 H arms of the two stems are primed ( H ). Deletion of this base or replacing it with G, U or C caused a signi\u00aecant reduction in frameshift ef\u00aeciency (from 31 % to 8-13 %, Figure 3 , pKA71, 72, 73, 74) in good agreement with related studies on the MMTV pseudoknot (Chen et al., 1995) . Surprisingly, the A15 deletion mutant (pKA71) was relatively ef\u00aecient (8 %) in comparison to pKA5 (2.5 %). This proved to be a consequence of the identity of the last L2 nucleotide; changing the equivalent residue in pKA5 to A (pKA90) increased frameshifting to 8 %. The U or C at this position showed slightly lower frameshift ef\u00aeciency (pKA91 U, 6 % ; pKA92 C, 4 %). Three other parameters were investigated. Altering the basepair at the bottom of stem 2 from G\u00c1 C to C\u00c1G caused a modest reduction in frameshift ef\u00aeciency (pKA103, 22 %), as did shortening the length of L1 to a single A residue (pKA80, 19 %). More dramatic was the effect of altering S1 length; increasing (pKA78) or decreasing (pKA79) S1 by a single base-pair caused a four-to sixfold reduction in frameshift ef\u00aeciency, perhaps by preventing the loophelix interaction (see Discussion).",

Nonetheless, did the de\u00aecit of function of the other RNAs highlight a speci\u00aec contribution of the modi\u00aeed adenine residue, or was it a relatively uninformative consequence of odd interactions among the remaining components? Even minor base changes have the potential to modify pseudoknot conformation substantially (Kang & Tinoco, 1997) , and it was therefore important to establish whether major conformational differences existed between the two RNAs. We determined the secondary structures of KA-A and KA-G by chemical and enzymatic probing using an end-labelling procedure (van Belkum et al., 1988; Wyatt et al., 1990; Polson & Bass, 1994) . The two plasmids have an internal T7 promoter just upstream of the frameshift signal, allowing run-off transcripts to be prepared following linearisation with HindIII ( Figure 1 ). Transcripts of 99 nt were prepared from each plasmid, end-labelled with [g-33 P]ATP, gel puri\u00aeed and subjected to limited chemical and enzymatic digestion prior to analysis on denaturing 10 % or 15 % polyacrylamide gels. In these experiments, the Mg 2 level was kept at 2 mM (except for imidazole probing, where 10 mM Mg 2 was used) which is the approximate concentration of this ion in RRL (Jackson & Hunt, 1983 ) and sites of cleavage were scored only from those reactions where 80-90 % of the full-length RNA remained intact. A representative selection of the individual biochemical analyses and a diagrammatic summary are shown in Figure 4 . The bases are numbered from the \u00aerst base of the pseudoknot (G) in each case.

This Figure shows the primary sequence and proposed secondary structure of the pKA3, pKA5 and pKA-A pseudoknots. The slippery sequence is boxed. Nucleotides of pKA-A that differ in orientation or presence from those of pKA5 are shown in bold. A series of mutations were created in pKA5 and pKA-A, and the effects on frameshifting measured by in vitro transcription and translation in the RRL. The upper portion of the Figure shows the RRL translation products synthesised in response to mRNAs derived from BamHI-digested plasmids. Products were labelled with [ 35 S]methionine, separated on a SDS-15 % polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. The frameshifted (22, 28 or 85 kDa) and non-frameshifted (19 kDa) species are marked with arrows. The size of the \u00c01 frameshift product produced by the various mutant RNAs is determined by the number of nucleotides in the pseudoknot (see Results). The predicted sizes are 22 kDa (pKA-G, A, 69, 70, 72, 73, 74, 103 pFScass 5), 28 kDa (pKA71, 78, 80, pFScass 6) or 85 kDa (pKA5, 79, 90, 91, 92, pFScass 7). pFScass 5, 6 and 7 contain the minimal IBV frameshift signal and were translated to mark the position of the 22, 28 and 85 kDa frameshift products. In translations of pKA-based constructs in RRL, a low level of background polypeptides are present which arise as a result of aberrant initiation events (see Brierley et al., 1992) .

Structure probing with either imidazole or lead (lanes 7-8, 13-14) generated a similar pattern of bands highlighting the major regions of single and double-stranded RNA. Both pseudoknot stems showed resistance to chemical cleavage, especially the G C-rich S1. S2 was somewhat less resistant to imidazole, but was largely resistant to lead, consistent with the formation of this stem. RNase V 1 cuts were evident in S1 and were also seen in the 5 H -arm of stem 2 (lanes 10-11). The single strand-speci\u00aec enzymes RNase T 1 and U 2 (lanes 4-5, 16-17) reacted largely as expected, with those loop residues predicted to be single-stranded. Some cleavages were noted in stem regions. For both KA-G and KA-A, RNase T 1 cleavage was seen at G5, G16 and G19 within S1 and at G9, G10 and G33 (and weakly at G30 and G31) within S2. Similarly, an RNase U 2 cut was seen at A32 of S2 for both pseudoknots, although cleavage was slightly less in pKA-A. The intercalated residue A15 at the junction of the two stems was only weakly reactive with RNase U 2 in either RNA. The reactivity of residues G9 and G10 at the top of S2 with single-stranded enzymatic and chemical probes was seen in previous studies with IBV pseudoknot variants (pKA13 and pKA18; Napthine et al., 1999) and may be indicative of a region of unusual conformation. Overall, however, KA-G and KA-A appear to possess a similar secondary structure given the restricted resolution of chemical and enzymatic probing.",

From these, we judged that the two G\u00c1C pairs near the top of S1 (C4\u00c1G18 and G5\u00c1C17, Figure 3 ) were the most likely candidate for a loop base acceptor. We modelled several changes in that region using NAMOT (Carter & Tung, 1996) to identify mutations that would affect base-pairing with A29 while unlikely, on their own, to signi\u00aecantly change the structure or thermodynamic stability of the KA pseudoknot. A simple base-\u00afip to give G4 \u00c1 C18 and C5 \u00c1G17 was theoretically ideal due to the absence of obvious confounding effects. This mutation would modify the hydrogen bond pro\u00aele of the putative loop acceptor. In the\u00afipped case, the N1 of A29 can no longer form an optimum linear hydrogen bond with the hydrogen of the guanine exocyclic amine. Further, the G18 N3 (which has one lone pair) is replaced by a pyrimidine O2 with its two lone pairs (see Kielkopf et al., 1998a,b) . The\u00afip does not substantially alter the predicted stability of S1 (12.1 versus 12.4 kcal/mol; as the energetics of pseudoknot formation is not fully understood, the S1 stability predictions, calculated according to the rules reported by Turner et al. (1988) , were performed on the basis that the stem formed independently and had a loop length of 8 nt).",

            "text": "In a recent mutational analysis of the SRV-1 pseudoknot (Sung & Kang, 1998) , it was found that replacing the 3 H -terminal L2 base, a uracil, with other bases had no effect on frameshifting. This was inconsistent with our \u00aending that the frameshift ef\u00aeciency of pKA-A depended crucially on the A29 residue because the pseudoknots are thought to be similar both in structure and function, with both RNAs adopting a bent conformation (see, for example, Sung & Kang, 1998 , but note the con\u00aficting NMR data by . Therefore, we would have expected SRV-1 pseudoknot function to be sensitive to modi\u00aecations of the L2 3 H -terminal base, which was not the case. The recent study by Le et al. (1998) , however, who modelled the structure of VPK in the presence of water and sodium ions, provides a potential explanation for the differing response of the SRV-1 and KA-A pseudoknots to such changes. They predicted a compact structure in which the \u00aerst four L2 nucleotides (ACUC) of VPK make a sharp turn, and the remaining four A residues of L2 cross the minor groove with the last two A residues contacting the top of S1 directly. The compact packing of L2 onto S1 is facilitated by the shortness of the loop and by the presence of the A quartet. The SRV-1 pseudoknot differs from the MMTV, VPK and KA-A pseudoknots in L2, which is \u00aeve bases longer in SRV-1 (13 versus 8 nt) and contains a U, rather than an A-rich stretch at the 3 H -end of L2. RNA derived by T7 transcription of (a) pKA-G/HindIII or (b) pKA-A/HindIII was 5 H endlabelled with [g-33 P]ATP and subjected to limited RNase or chemical cleavage using structure-speci\u00aec probes. Sites of cleavage were identi\u00aeed by comparison with a ladder of bands created by limited alkaline hydrolysis of the RNA (OH \u00c0 ) and the position of known RNase U 2 and T 1 cuts, determined empirically. Products were analysed on 15 % acrylamide/ 7 M urea gels. Data was also collected from 10 % gels (gels not shown). Enzymatic structure probing was with RNases U 2 , V 1 and T 1 . Uniquely cleaved nucleotides were identi\u00aeed by their absence in untreated control lanes (0). The number of units of enzyme added to each reaction is indicated. Chemical structure probing was with imidazole (I, hours) or lead acetate (Pb 2 ; mM concentration in reaction). The water lane (W) in the imidazole panel represents RNA which was dissolved in water, incubated for 4 hours and processed in parallel to the imidazole-treated samples. R represents an aliquot of the puri\u00aeed RNA loaded directly onto the gel without incubation in a reaction buffer. (b) Summary of the KA-A probing results. The sensitivity of bases in the KA-A frameshift region to the various probes is shown. The size of the symbols is approximately proportional to the intensity of cleavage at that site. The imidazole probing data, which was similar to that seen with lead acetate, is omitted for clarity. The KA-G probing results are not summarised since they were essentially the same as those of KA-A. Also, L1 of the SRV-1 pseudoknot comprises a single A residue, whereas the others have two bases in L1 ( Figure 6 ). In SRV-1, the extended L2 length and altered sequence composition could well prevent a stimulatory contact with S1. If this is the case, then shortening L2 of SRV-1 should promote frameshifting. Indeed, ten Dam et al. (1995) demonstrated that removing two or three bases from L2 of SRV-1 increased frameshifting from 20 % to 34 %, although further base deletions to an L2 length of 9 and 7 nt had the opposite effect and decreased frameshifting to 18 and 10 %. On this basis, we would predict that the KA pseudoknots should be rendered relatively insensitive to L2 terminal base changes by increasing the L2 length to that of SRV-1. Figure 5 . Evidence for a loophelix interaction in pseudoknot KA-A. (a) The in\u00afuence of the L2 terminal nucleotide (X29) on \u00c01 ribosomal frameshifting was tested in the context of (KA-FL-X) a variant of pKA-A in which two S1 bases had been\u00afipped (G5 \u00c1C17; C4 \u00c1 G18; boxed); (KA-LL-X), a variant of pKA-A in which L2 had been increased to 14 nt by insertion of 6 nt (AUCAUC) and (KA-FL-LL-X), a variant of pKA-A in which both\u00afip and L2 increase were present. The effect on frameshifting of varying base A29 in the context of the wild-type pseudoknot is shown for comparative purposes (KA-X). The RRL translation products synthesised in response to mRNAs derived from BamHI-digested pKA-A and mutant derivatives are shown. Products were labelled with [ 35 S]methionine, separated on a SDS-15 % polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. The frameshifted (fs; 22 kDa) and nonframeshifted (stop; 19 kDa) species are marked with arrows. (b) A comparison of the frameshift ef\u00aeciencies measured for each X29 variant in the four pseudoknot contexts; wild-type (KA-X), S1 bases\u00afipped (KA-FL-X), L2 length increase (KA-LL-X), S1 base-pairs ipped and L2 length increase (KA-FL-LL-X).",

Although a variety of pseudoknots were constructed that contained an intercalating A residue at the junction between the two pseudoknot stems (an essential feature of a kinked pseudoknot), ef\u00aecient frameshifting was not observed until the last nucleotide of L2 was changed from a G to an A residue (Table 1) . This result was consistent with the possibility that frameshifting requires an interaction between L2 and residues in S1. Further mutational analysis was carried out to demonstrate that the loop-helix interaction, between the terminal L2 adenine residue and S1, is essential for ef\u00aecient frameshifting. Interactions of this kind, involving adenosine residues, have been recognised increasingly in both pseudoknots and in other RNA structures. In the P4-P6 domain of the Tetrahymena thermophila intron, each adenosine in a GAAA tetraloop makes speci\u00aec hydrogen bonds to the tetraloop receptor, comprising two adjacent C\u00c1G base-pairs, a 5 nt internal loop and a G\u00c1U base-pair (Cate et al., 1996a,b) .

From these, we judged that the region of pKA-A most likely to act as a loop base receptor would be the penultimate two base-pairs in S1 (C4 \u00c1 G18 and G5 \u00c1C17). Since an interaction between the loop adenosine and the S1 helix is likely to require a particular placement of the hydrogen bond donor/ acceptor capacities along the minor groove, the inhibitory effect found upon replacing A with any other base ought to be recapitulated by changes in the putative loop acceptor region. Flipping the two G \u00c1C base-pairs was predicted to change the hydrogen bond donor/acceptor pro\u00aele in a way that was unlikely to distort the overall conformation of stem 1. Indeed,\u00afipping the G\u00c1C base-pairs impaired frameshifting only in the construct with an adenosine residue at the end of L2 (pKA-FL-A), con\u00aerming the absence of any general effect on frameshifting of the S1 changes. Thus only the combination of an L2 terminal adenosine with a particular S1 G \u00c1C base-pair orientation was fully functional, and changes of either partner of the proposed interaction had identical inhibitory effects. This strongly supports the conclusion that A29 is contacting the S1 minor groove and that this contact is important for ef\u00aecient frameshifting.",

It is feasible, however, that the structure probing methods used were not sensitive enough to detect such, possibly very subtle, conformational changes. Clearly, structural analysis at higher resolution will be required to address this question. Secondly, the pKA-A construct was very sensitive to alterations in S1 length; increasing or decreasing S1 by a single base-pair reduced frameshifting dramatically, despite the fact that the putative S1 loop acceptor bases were still present. However, this may be explicable in terms of helix rotation; increasing or decreasing the length of S1 would presumably change the position of L2 with respect to the helix, which could well perturb the loophelix interaction.",

Studies of functional and non-functional MMTV-based pseudoknots (Chen et al., 1995 (Chen et al., , 1996 Kang et al., 1996; Kang & Tinoco, 1997) have shown that frameshifting requires the pseudoknot to be in a speci\u00aec kinked conformation. It has been proposed that this conformation can only be achieved when a single intercalated residue (A15) is present between the two pseudoknot stems and that the stability of base-pairs adjacent to A15 may be in\u00afuenced by how well they stack onto proximal loop residues. It is conceivable, therefore, that the functionality of pseudoknots with variations in residue 29 (pKA-A, G, U and C) is in\u00afuenced by the kind of stacking interactions that occur between these bases and the adjacent residues in loop 2 (A28) or stem 2 (G30). Clearly, interactions that occur between bases at the junction of the two pseudoknot stems will play some role in determining the overall conformation of the structure. Indeed, changing the base-pair at the bottom of S2 from G30\u00c1C14 to C30\u00c1G14 (pKA 103, Figure 2 ) had a modest impact on frameshifting ef\u00aeciency, lowering it to 22 %. However, although no speci\u00aec experiments were carried out to test a contribution of stacking to the frameshifting phenotype of the X29 variants, the available evidence is more supportive of an effect on a helixloop interaction. Firstly, the preference for an A at the end of loop 2 was maintained even without the intercalating A15 residue (pKA71 and pKA90), which presumably would modify the potential for base stacking of A29 onto G30. Secondly, a speci\u00aec reduction of frameshifting was seen only in the S1 ip construct KA-FL-A, but not in the other X29 variants. These \u00aendings, in combination with the available structural information are most consistent with a loop-helix contact model.",

            "text": "The differential effects on frameshifting seen with X29 variants of the KA-A pseudoknot are not seen with the SRV-1 pseudoknot (Sung & Kang, 1998) . We speculate that this is a consequence of the increased length and altered sequence composition of L2, which may preclude a loop-helix interaction of the kind seen with KA-A. Indeed, increasing the length of L2 in the KA-X29 series reduced the differential effect of the L2 terminal base, bringing the frameshift ef\u00aeciencies closer to the value reported for the SRV-1 pseudoknot (23 %; ten Dam et al., 1994) . Thus the KA-A and SRV-1 pseudoknots respond differently to L2 mutations. In the KA-A pseudoknot with an 8 nt L2 (and very likely in the MMTV pseudoknot), the indicated loop-helix interaction seems to contribute signi\u00aecantly to frameshifting ef\u00aeciency. In contrast, in KA-A variants with a longer L2, frameshifting ef\u00aeciency was reduced (from 31 % to 18 %, pKA-LL-A) in response to the length increase, and the G \u00c1C\u00afip in S1 (pKA-FL-LL-A) had only a small inhibitory effect. Other factors, and not a loop-helix interaction involving an L2 terminal adenosine residue, are thus likely to be responsible for the ability of the SRV-1 pseudoknot to direct frameshifting. One possibility is L1 length; NMR studies suggest that it possesses only a single A residue in L1 . A variant of pKA-A in which L1 was reduced to a single A residue (pKA80, Figure 2 ) showed reduced frameshifting, indicating that a single L1 nucleotide is not optimal in this class of pseudoknot, and further supports the idea that the KA-A and SRV-1 pseudoknots are not structurally equivalent.",

            "text": "The pseudoknots described here are part of a larger set of RNA structures that stimulate frameshifting. In HIV-1, for instance, the stimulatory element is a simple hairpin structure rather than a pseudoknot (Kang, 1998 ). An intermediate structure is seen at the frameshift site of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), where the stimulatory RNA structure is pseudoknotted but able to tolerate disruptions of S2 to some degree (Marczinke et al., 1998) . At the other extreme are pseudoknots of the IBV class that require both a long S1 and a stable S2 for function. How can the apparent diversity of frameshifter pseudoknots be reconciled in terms of the frameshift process itself? At present, models for pseudoknot stimulated frameshifting tend to invoke a common 3D structure as the determinant of function. In this model, pseudoknots stimulate frameshifting through the formation of an RNA-RNA or RNA-protein interaction, perhaps by mimicking a tRNA (Chen et al., 1996) . To date, however, there is no evidence that a structural feature exists that is shared by all stimulatory RNA elements, although this is not inconceivable. A competing model that has some theoretical appeal is that the stimulatory RNAs share mechanical properties, such as initial resistance to unwinding. Dinman (1995) has suggested that the role of S2 of a pseudoknot may be to prevent routine unwinding of S1. Stem 1 must be able to rotate around its helix axis to unwind and the association of the bases at the top of the helix with the downstream sequences (to form S2) might prevent such rotation. The present \u00aendings do not particularly favour either hypothesis. A loop-helix interaction will almost certainly modify the 3D structure of the pseudoknot, thus in\u00afuencing factor recognition, but also the stability of S1 and the ease with which it is unwound. In order to discriminate between the models, a determination the 3D structure of the KA-A and KA-FL-A RNA pseudoknots would be advantageous, as would the development of methods to investigate the unwinding (as opposed to melting) behaviour of RNA pseudoknots.",
