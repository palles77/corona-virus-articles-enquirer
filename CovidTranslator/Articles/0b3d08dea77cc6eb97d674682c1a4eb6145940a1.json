Here, we show that two types of neurons from distinct brain regions exhibited differential permissivity to replication of several positive-stranded RNA viruses. Granule cell neurons (GCN) of the cerebellum and cortical neurons (CN) from the cerebral cortex have unique innate immune programs that confer differential susceptibility to viral infection ex vivo and in vivo. By transducing CN with genes that were expressed more highly in GCN, we identified three interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs; Ifi27, Irg1, and Rsad2/Viperin) that mediated antiviral effects against different neurotropic viruses. Moreover, we found that the epigenetic state and microRNA-mediated regulation of ISGs correlates with enhanced antiviral response in GCN. Thus, neurons from evolutionarily distinct brain regions have unique innate immune signatures, which likely contribute to their relative permissiveness to infection.",

RNA intermediates of virus replication are recognized by pathogen recognition receptors (PRR), such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR), which signal specific transcription factors to induce innate defense programs, including type I interferon (IFN) expression and secretion. Binding of IFN to IFN-\u03b1\u03b2 receptor (Ifnar) on infected and uninfected cells results in a signaling cascade that restricts infection of many viruses through expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Several studies report that type I IFN receptor-knockout mice (Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 ) exhibit enhanced mortality after viral infection due to increased viral burden and expanded tropism in neurons of the brain 1,2 .",

Granule cell neurons (GCN) of the cerebellum and cortical neurons (CN) from the cerebral cortex are differentially permissive for WNV infection in humans 8, 12 . To determine whether these neurons respond uniquely to antiviral cytokines and infectious challenge, we infected GCN and CN cultures with WNV in the presence or absence of IFN-\u03b2 treatment. While IFN-\u03b2 pre-treatment (100 IU/ml, 24 hours) inhibited WNV replication in CN by 15fold (P < 0.0001), it reduced infection ~100 fold (P < 0.0001) in GCN at 24 to 48 hours after infection (Fig 1a) . A greater responsiveness to IFN-\u03b2 in GCN compared to CN also was observed with other positive-stranded RNA viruses including a flavivirus (Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), up to 95-fold), an alphavirus (Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), up to 10,000-fold, P < 0.0001), and a coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), up to 200-fold, P < 0.0005) (Fig 1b-d) . GCN also were less permissive for WNV replication at baseline in the absence of IFN-\u03b2 treatment (15 to 110-fold lower titers at 24 and 48 hours, P < 0.0001) (Fig 1a) , with similar findings observed with SLEV (up to 700fold, P < 0.005), VEEV (up to 200-fold, P < 0.05), and MHV (up to 20-fold, at 24 and 36 hours, P < 0.0001) (Fig 1b-d) . The percentage of cells infected by WNV was greater in CN compared to GCN at baseline or after IFN-\u03b2 pre-treatment ( Supplementary Fig 1) . Consistent with the observation of greater infection of CN, the concentration of type I IFN secreted into the supernatant after WNV infection was higher in CN compared to GCN cultures ( Supplementary Fig 2) .",

Global gene expression in GCN and CN in response to IFN-\u03b2 treatment revealed overlapping yet distinct gene signatures (Fig 2a) . Computational analysis revealed that genes associated with type I IFN induction (PRR (e.g., TLR and RLR)) and IFN regulatory factors (e.g., Irf1, Irf7, and Irf9) and effector function (e.g., Mx1 and Oas) were induced in both GCN and CN (Supplementary Table 1 ). We speculated that the two neuronal subtypes might differentially express key host defense genes at the basal level, which could impact responsiveness to IFN and susceptibility to infection. Indeed, the basal and IFN-\u03b2-induced levels of genes involved in IFN induction, signaling, and effector function generally were higher in GCN (Fig 2b, P < 0.01), and included Irf7, Stat1, Ifit1, and Oas1 (Supplementary Table 2 ). This pattern, which was confirmed by qRT-PCR ( Supplementary Fig 3) , suggests that the greater IFN sensitivity of GCN may be due to higher basal expression of PRR and IFN signaling genes. Indeed, some of the ISGs (e.g., Stat1, Ifi27, and Rsad2) showed differential basal expression yet similarly induced levels of expression after IFN-\u03b2 treatment. Other ISGs (e.g., Ccl5 and Cxcl5) showed differences in expression patterns between IFN-\u03b2 treated and WNV-infected cells. This may reflect variation in IFN-dependent and IFN-independent gene induction that occurs in the context of WNV replication and recognition by intracellular PRRs.",

We detected an enrichment of genes with functions associated with immune responses to viral infection. Canonical PRR signaling through TLR and RLR pathways (e.g., Tlr7, Ddx58/Rig-I, and Ifih1/Mda5), transcription factors (e.g., Nf\u03baB, Irf7, and Irf9), and their corresponding target genes (e.g., Ccl5 and Tnf\u03b1) were expressed at higher levels in GCN at the basal level (Supplementary Table 2 ). In particular, Stat1 and IFN signaling-dependent genes (e.g., Ifit1, Ifit3, Oas, and Mx1) also were expressed in GCN basally at higher levels compared to CN. In resting or IFN-\u03b2-treated GCN, we observed an enrichment of genes that have been linked to antiviral activity (e.g., Ifit1, Rsad2, Oas1, Irf7, Bst2/Tetherin, Unc93b1, Ifih1/Mda5, Ddx58/Rig-I, Mx1, Ikbk\u03b5/Ikk\u03b5, and Stat1), autophagy and inflammation (immune-related GTPases (Irgm1, Irgm2, Igtp/ Irgm3, and Ifi47/Irg47, Tgtp1/Irgb6)), and leukocyte chemotaxis (Ccl5, Cxcl1, Cxcl10, and Cxcl16) ( Supplementary Fig 4 and Supplementary Table 2 ). This pattern of gene expression is consistent with results showing that GCN are less permissive to virus replication at baseline or in the presence of IFN-\u03b2 treatment (Fig 1a-d) .",

Thus, a higher basal expression of host defense genes makes GCN more poised than CN for antiviral action in response to IFN-\u03b2, and ultimately impacts the induced level expression of ISGs. Notably, addition of a blocking monoclonal antibody to Ifnar restored (~20-fold, P < 0.0001) WNV replication in GCN, yet had little effect in CN (Fig 1f) . Thus, the lower susceptibility of GCN to viral replication compared to CN at baseline is not likely attributed to differences in virus entry, but rather to higher expression of genes with an IFN signature, which confer greater responsiveness to the antiviral effects of type I IFN.",

We hypotheiszed that IFN-\u03b2 would have a greater antiviral effect on WNV-MAD in CN compared to WNV-NY. Indeed, WNV-MAD infection was restricted to a greater degree (~300 fold for WNV-MAD at 24 hours after infection, P < 0.0001) after IFN-\u03b2 treatment of CN (Fig 1e) . In comparison, the inhibitory effect of IFN-\u03b2 against WNV-MAD and WNV-NY was more equivalent (~80-fold compared to ~50 fold at 24 hours after infection, P < 0.0001) in GCN. These results support the idea that Stat1-dependent signaling proteins are expressed at greater levels basally in GCN (Supplementary Fig 5) and contribute to the enhanced responsiveness to the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b2 in this cell type. To establish whether differential expression of ISGs was due to Stat1-dependent signaling, studies were repeated in Stat1 \u2212/\u2212 and wild-type GCN. Stat1 \u2212/\u2212 GCN showed lower basal expression of several ISGs compared to wild-type GCN ( Supplementary Fig 6) .",

We attempted to create a GCN-like antiviral phenotype in CN by ectopically expressing individual GCN-specific genes in CN. Candidate genes included ones showing higher expression at the basal level (e.g., Irg1, Ifi27, Ifi44, Isg15, Bst2/tetherin, Rsad2, Ifitm3, Ifi204, Trim30, and Casp12) or greater induction after IFN-\u03b2 treatment (e.g., Ifit2, Cmpk2, and Lcn2) in GCN (Supplementary Table 2 ). Irf1, which was reported as a broad-acting antiviral signaling molecule 15, 16 , was included as a positive control. We developed a high-efficiency (~90%) lentivirus transduction system for ectopic expression of ISGs in primary neurons (Fig 4a) . Thirty-nine ISGs were cloned, transduced into CN, and their antiviral effects were assessed in the absence or presence of exogenous IFN-\u03b2 (Fig 4, and data not shown). Three genes (Irg1, Ifi27, and Rsad2) resulted in reduced (5 to 20-fold, P < 0.05) WNV yield when expressed ectopically in CN (Fig 4b and c) ; analogously, reduced viral infection with expression of these genes also was observed with SLEV (3 to 10-fold, P < 0.0001) and WNV-MAD (5 to 20-fold, P < 0.0001) (Fig 4f and g) . Ectopic expression of Irg1 (7-fold P < 0.0005) and Ifi27 (3-fold P < 0.01) but not Rsad2 (P > 0.05) inhibited MHV infection (Fig 4h) . Ectopic expression of these three genes (or any of the other ISGs tested) did not alter cell viability (Fig 4d, and data not shown) or confer an antiviral effect when tested in parallel against VEEV (Fig 4e) ; thus it is unlikely that the antiviral effect observed with WNV was due to cellular stress. Moreover, transduction of shRNA against Ifi27, Irg1, or Rsad2 in GCN correspondingly resulted in enhanced infection of WNV-MAD (~10-fold, P < 0.0001) (Fig 4i) .",

While treatment with the HDAC inhibitor did not alter cell viability under the conditions tested (Fig 5a, right) , it reduced viral yields (5-fold, P < 0.0001) (Fig 5a, left) and resulted in derepression of expression of ISGs that had otherwise exhibited low basal expression levels in CN (Fig 5b) .",

One candidate for regulating this is microRNA-132, which is required for morphogenesis of cortical and hippocampal neurons, targets p300, and negatively regulates IFN-\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b2 signaling and antiviral immunity [24] [25] [26] . Expression of microRNA-132 reportedly is higher in the cerebral cortex compared to the cerebellum of rats and humans 27, 28 . We also observed higher expression of microRNA-132 in CN and the cerebral cortex compared to GCN and the cerebellum (Fig 5c) . Moreover, ectopic expression of microRNA-132 in GCN (Fig 5d) decreased expression of some ISGs (Fig 5e) but did not change expression of non-ISGs (Fig  5f) . However, no change in viral yield was detected when microRNA-132 was expressed ectopically in GCN (data not shown). We suggest that the distinct antiviral programs observed between GCN and CN are explained in part by differences in the epigenetic state of key genes, which is influenced by the expression of specific microRNA.",

The low level of GCN infection, however, was not due to inefficient viral spread to the cerebellum, since the adjacent Purkinje cell neurons were infected. In comparison, in the brains of Ifnar \u2212/\u2212 mice, comparable levels of WNV antigen were detected in both CN and GCN after i.c. infection (Fig 6b, bottom panels) .

A recent study demonstrated regional differences in basal chemokine and cytokine secretion by astrocytes grown from the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord 31 , although no differences in type I IFN production were reported.

Irg1 is induced in macrophages and tissues from mice infected with the intracellular parasite, Toxoplasma gondii or bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes 34 . To date, no antimicrobial functions have been ascribed to this gene although it associates with the mitochondria, a site of regulation for PRR adaptor molecules and the antiviral signalosome 34, 35 .

We observed a large number of Stat1-dependent genes that were expressed at higher levels in the basal and induced states in GCN compared to CN. Unphosphorylated Stat1 can promote expression of antiviral genes without IFN-dependent stimulation 43 , and higher basal levels of Stat1 can amplify cell-intrinsic immune responses by activating an amplification loop 44, 45 . Stat1 and its downstream gene targets could be differentially regulated in GCN and CN via epigenetic and/or microRNA-dependent control mechanisms. The epigenetic control of ISG expression and its impact on antiviral responses has been reported [17] [18] [19] [20] . Accordingly, treatment of CN with an HDAC inhibitor reduced WNV yield and resulted in de-repression of expression of ISG at the basal level. One caveat to these studies is that inconsistent ISG expression phenotypes have been observed with HDAC inhibitors 46, 47 , although these differences may reflect variation in cell types, or concentration and time of inhibitor incubation. Our experiments also revealed higher expression in CN compared to GCN of microRNA-132, which targets the p300 co-activator of Stat1; ectopic expression of microRNA-132 in GCN decreased basal expression of ISGs. Distinct antiviral programs observed between GCN and CN may be explained by differences in the epigenetic state of key genes, which is influenced by the expression of microRNA.",
