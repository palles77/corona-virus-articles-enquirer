In addition, she suffered from cytomegalovirus and subsequently coronavirus NL63 infection. She showed low serum levels of IgG (103 mg/dL), IgM (11 mg/dL), and IgA (3 mg/dL). Although sequential IVIG and subcutaneous immunoglobulin appeared to be effective, she had persistent respiratory symptoms and progressive consolidation on chest X-ray and CT ( Figures   S2D and S3E ). Anti-GM-CSF antibody was not detected in the serum. BAL fluid at 8 months of age contained PAS-positive acidophilic material ( Figure S4D ",
