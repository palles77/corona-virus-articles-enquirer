            "text": "Orthogonal pooling was evaluated as a strategy for the rapid screening of multiple cysteine and serine proteases against large compound libraries. To validate the method the human cysteine protease cathepsin B was screened against a library of 64,000 individual compounds and also against the same library mixed 10 compounds per well. The orthogonal pooling method used resulted in each compound being present in two wells, mixed with a different set of nine other compounds in each location. Thus hits were identified based on activity in both locations, avoiding the need for retesting of each component of active mixtures. Hits were tested in dose-response both in the dithiothreitol (DTT)containing buffer used in the primary HTS and in buffer containing cysteine in place of DTT to rule out artifacts due to oxidative inactivation of the enzyme. Comparison of the confirmed actives from singlecompound and mixture screening showed that mixture screening identified all of the actives from singlecompound HTS. Based on these results the orthogonal pooling strategy has been used successfully to rapidly screen several cysteine and serine proteases.",

            "text": "O NE OF OUR GOALS at the Penn Center for Molecular Discovery, 1 Philadelphia, PA, is to develop capabilities for screening multiple members of target classes, for example, cysteine and serine proteases. As part of the Molecular Libraries Screening Center Network (MLSCN) we have access to a diverse library of more than 200,000 compounds. Our aim is to test the entire MLSCN compound library against multiple cysteine and serine proteases to obtain a profile of activity against these enzyme classes. This profile may then be used to immediately identify selective compounds during subsequent screening of novel enzyme targets. It may also be possible to identify a subset of the library with an enhanced hit rate towards these enzyme families that might provide the basis for gene family screening. One strategy that enables the rapid screening of large compound libraries against multiple targets is to screen compound mixtures instead of individual compounds; reagent costs and screening times can thereby be reduced significantly. We chose to evaluate an orthogonal pooling strategy that gives 10 compounds per well, as described in detail below. An advantage of this method is that each compound is in two plates, mixed with a different set of nine other compounds at each location. This duplication improves the validity of statistical interpretation of the HTS and greatly simplifies deconvolution of the results as activity in both wells containing a given compound immediately identifies that compound as a hit. This method has been used with some success in several pharmaceutical companies. [2] [3] [4] Human liver cathepsin B (EC 3.4.22.1) was chosen as a prototype from the cysteine protease family to validate the compound pooling strategy. Cathepsin B is a lysosomal cysteine protease that is involved in many physiological processes, such as remodeling of the extracellular matrix during wound healing, apoptosis, and activation of thyroxin and renin. [5] [6] [7] In addition to its physiological roles, cathepsin B is important in many pathological processes, such as cancer, inflammation, and infection. Overexpression and secretion of cathepsin B occur in many types of tumors and correlate positively with invasion and metastasis. 8 Cathepsin B facilitates tu-mor invasion by dissolving extracellular matrix, and inhibitors of the enzyme have been shown to reduce both tumor cell motility and invasiveness in vitro. [9] [10] [11] Inhibitors of cathepsin B are therefore of interest as potential anticancer agents. There has also been a recent resurgence of interest in cathepsin B due to research showing that proteolysis by this enzyme is required for the entry and replication of the Ebola and severe acute respiratory syndrome viruses in human cells. Studies have confirmed roles for cathepsin B and cathepsin L in Ebola virus glycoprotein-mediated infection. 12, 13 Cathepsin B inhibitors were shown to diminish the multiplication of infectious Ebola virus-Zaire in cultured cells and may merit investigation as anti-Ebola virus drugs. 14 Validation of the compound pooling strategy is provided here by the results of screening cathepsin B using a simple end-point assay monitoring the release of the fluorophore aminomethyl coumarin (AMC) upon enzymatic hydrolysis of an AMC-labeled dipeptide. Pooling allowed us to screen 64,000 compounds in a single 3-h HTS run. We also screened cathepsin B by single-compound HTS, allowing us to compare the hit profile obtained by single and mixture screening. The most important consideration was to ensure that all of the active compounds discovered by single-compound screening were also identified by mixture screening.",

Two microliters from each BioFocus DPI plate was pipetted into a polypropylene V-bottom plate containing 18 l per well of DMSO and mixed by repeated aspiration and dispense (15 l) . Plates were heat-sealed and stored at room temperature for 1-2 weeks in a desiccator prior to use. Plates for mixture HTS were prepared as shown in Fig. 1 . Two hundred plates containing the 64,000 compounds from BioFocus DPI were arranged in two 10 \u03eb 10 grids of 100 plates each. Sets of 10 plates were pooled to give a single mixture plate as shown, resulting in 20 mixture plates per 100 single-compound plates. An automated plate pooling protocol was set up on a Thermo-CRS (Burlington, ON, Canada) screening deck, controlled by Polara operating software. The heat seals were removed by hand from each set of 10 single-compound plates and replaced with loose-fitting polystyrene plate lids. Each plate in turn was delidded and placed on a Perkin Elmer EP3 workstation. Two microliters of compound in DMSO from each plate was transferred by pipetting head (384 disposable tips) into a single mixture plate, giving a final mixture volume of 20 l. The concentration of each mixture was 10 mM in DMSO (1 mM per compound). After pipetting was complete each plate was immediately heatsealed to minimize exposure to atmospheric moisture. In a separate protocol the mixture plates were then diluted fourfold by transfer of 5 l of each mixture into 15 l of DMSO to give mixtures 2.5 mM in DMSO (250 M per compound). Plates were heat-sealed and stored at room temperature for 2-3 days in a desiccator prior to use.",

It has been reported previously that redox-sensitive compounds can be reduced by DTT to produce reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. Under these conditions enzymes that contain an active-site cysteine are inactivated by thiol oxidation. There are numerous examples of such compounds that react with DTT and thus cause enzyme inactivation but show no activity in the presence of cysteine. 21, 22 Thus compounds that inhibited cathepsin B in the presence of DTT but not cysteine were judged to be artifacts. Table 1 lists the compounds con-false-positive rate in the mixture HTS was \u03fe10-fold lower than that for the single-compound HTS (2.6% vs. 27%). These percentages are based on one HTS campaign under each set of conditions so we have not determined the degree to which the differences are statistically significant. Nevertheless, the mixture HTS does appear to be the more reliable predictor of compound activity on subsequent dose-response confirmation. This presum-ably reflects the statistical value of screening each mixture component in duplicate rather than in one well in the case of the single compound HTS.",

Thus we addressed the following question: are there any confirmed active compounds from the single-compound screening that were missed in the mixture HTS? Inspection of a Primary HTS hits were defined as \u03fe20% inhibition in both locations in mixture HTS, or \u03fe33% inhibition in the one location in single-compound HTS. Active in dose-response was defined as IC 50 \u03fe50 M. Marginal in dose-response was defined as IC 50 \u03fd50 M with percentage inhibition 30-50% at 50 M. Inactive in dose-response (another active present) was defined as dose-response testing in which individual compounds gave no activity, defined as IC 50 \u03fe50 M and percentage inhibition at 50 M \u03fd30%. These compounds were selected for dose-response testing as the two mixtures from which they originated gave percentage inhibition \u03fe20% in the mixture HTS. However, the mixture that gave the highest percentage inhibition in HTS was found also to contain one of the 30 compounds confirmed active in dose-response testing. Inactive in dose-response (no other active present) was defined as dose-response testing in which individual compounds gave no activity, defined as IC 50 \u03fe50 M and percentage inhibition at 50 M \u03fd30%. In the case of single-compound HTS, these compounds were selected for dose-response testing as they were identified as hits that gave percentage inhibition \u03fe33%. In the case of mixture HTS, this compound was selected for dose-response testing as the two mixtures from which it originated gave percentage inhibition \u03fe20%. Despite the discrepancy between activity in the mixture HTS and lack of activity in dose-response, none of the 30 confirmed active compounds was present in the original mixtures. Retest rate was defined as active in dose-response as a percentage of primary HTS hits. False-positive rate was defined as inactive in dose-response (no other active present) as a percentage of primary HTS hits. N/A, not applicable. 1 reveals that the majority of confirmed active compounds were hits in both screens. However, some compounds were hits in either single-compound or mixture HTS but not both. The extent of the overlap of the HTS hits is illustrated by the Venn diagram in Fig. 5 . Of 27 confirmed actives identified from single-compound HTS, 23 were also identified from mixture HTS. Thus the mixture screening missed four confirmed actives from the single-compound screening. However, this analysis looks significantly different if the DTT-reactive artifacts are excluded. As discussed above, numerous compounds were found to cause enzyme inactivation by reacting with DTT in the assay buffer. After retesting in dose-response using a cysteine-containing buffer there remained 17 confirmed actives from single-compound screening, all of which were hits in the mixture HTS. Thus after excluding artifacts mixture screening identified all of the actives from the single-compound screening. Interestingly, mixture HTS identified an additional three compounds that were not classified as hits in the single-compound HTS. However, these compounds did show 20-30% inhibition in the single-compound HTS, below the 33% threshold used for hit selection. The fact that the activity of the DTT-reactive artifacts did not correlate well between mixture and single-compound HTS suggests that other compounds in the mixture may modulate the reactivity of these artifacts, by affecting either initial compound reduction by DTT or inactivation of the cathepsin B enzyme by the reactive oxygen species generated by the DTT-compound redox chemistry.",
