Barium esophagram has a limited role in patients with AIDS. Infections are the most common cause of esophageal disease in patients with AIDS. Although many of these infections have a characteristic appearance on barium radiography, overlap is frequent, thus mandating a definitive diagnosis by other means before prescribing antimicrobial therapy. In addition, some therapies for these disorders (e.g., corticosteroids) may be associated with significant toxicity, further emphasizing the importance of a histologic diagnosis. Last, in patients with severe odynophagia, the barium study may be inadequate because severe pain on swallowing will limit the amount of barium that can be swallowed, thus limiting the quality of the study. For these reasons, endoscopy with biopsy is the preferred diagnostic modality in this group of patients as this will yield a definitive diagnosis in 75% of cases.",

Pancreatograms at the time of ERCP have shown abnormalities of the pancreatic ducts consistent with chronic pancreatitis. These findings have led many investigators to hypothesize that pancreatic insufficiency from chronic pancreatitis is an important cause of chronic diarrhea in AIDS; however, most cases of chronic pancreatitis are attributable to conditions, such as alcohol abuse. The most common medications associated with pancreatitis in AIDS are pentamidine, ddI, and zalcitabine (ddC). Protease inhibitors frequently cause hyperlipidemia. Ritonavir is associated with the most dramatic increases in triglycerides with 10% of patients developing severe hypertriglyceridemia. Pancreatitis is well described in patients with elevations in triglycerides from protease inhibitors. Reported infectious causes of pancreatitis include CMV, HSV, MAC, and tuberculosis. An infectious cause of pancreatitis is difficult to establish and would require pancreatic biopsy. 8. How has HAART affected the incidence of opportunistic gastrointestinal (GI) disorders?",

Painful inguinal lymphadenopathy is an almost universal finding. The pain tends to distribute in the region of the sacral roots (i.e., buttocks, perineal region, and posterior thigh). Because of the neural involvement by HSV and the presence of severe pain, patients may complain of impotence and difficulty in initiating micturition. Visual inspection and anoscopy commonly reveal the following lesions: vesicles, pustular rectal lesions, or diffuse ulcerations. HSV is a pathogen of the squamous mucosa; therefore, diffuse proctitis involving the entire rectum is rare. In severe cases, the columnar rectal and sigmoid mucosa has been involved.

The diagnostic yield of colonoscopy in HIV-infected patients with chronic diarrhea and negative stool studies ranges from 27% to 37%; CMV is the most common etiology identified. Because CMV colitis is usually present in the distal colon, sigmoidoscopy with biopsy may be a sufficient workup, but in 13% to 39% of cases of CMV enterocolitis, the virus can be detected in the right colon only. Therefore, if CMV is suspected as the cause of diarrhea, a full colonoscopy is warranted, especially if sigmoidoscopy is negative. However, it is still not clear whether colonoscopy has a higher yield than flexible sigmoidoscopy for the detection of organisms other than CMV. Evaluation with colonoscopy would be prudent if sigmoidoscopy is negative and right-sided abdominal complaints are reported. The value of upper endoscopy and small bowel biopsy in the evaluation of chronic diarrhea has also been demonstrated, although specific treatment options for most small bowel pathogens are limited. Some would obtain ileal biopsy at the time of colonoscopy rather than proceed with upper endoscopy and biopsy. The most commonly detected organisms involving the small bowel are cryptosporidia and microsporidia.",

CMV has been identified in mucosal biopsy samples in as many as 45% of patients with AIDS and diarrhea, especially in those patients with negative stool studies. CMV causes both enteritis and colitis. A number of other viral pathogens have been reported to involve the GI tract in patients with AIDS, but their clinical importance remains to be determined. Examples include adenovirus, rotavirus, astrovirus, picobirnavirus, and coronavirus. There are also reports that HIV itself can be isolated from enterocytes and colonic cells, but its role in causing disease is uncertain. HSV can cause proctitis that mimics diarrhea because of the rectal mucous discharge. However, HSV does not cause enterocolitis because it invades the squamous mucosa, not the columnar epithelium, such as the one lining the colonic and small bowel mucosa. The natural history of CMV colitis is variable. In untreated patients, it usually has a chronic course characterized by progressive diarrhea and weight loss, although occasionally symptoms and histologic abnormalities remit spontaneously. Unlike CMV retinitis, for which strong evidence supports induction therapy followed by lifelong maintenance therapy, the optimal duration of therapy and the need for maintenance therapy in CMV colitis are undefined. Consensus guidelines recommend 3 to 6 weeks of induction therapy followed by maintenance therapy if there is a history of relapses. Two antivirals (foscarnet and ganciclovir) have been studied extensively in the therapy of CMV colitis and/or enteritis. Cidofovir, the newest intravenous agent, has been used primarily in patients with retinal disease, but in our experience it is effective for GI disease as well. The newest agent is valganciclovir. This drug can be given orally and achieves serum levels similar to intravenous ganciclovir. Studies for GI disease are limited.

Approximately 20% of patients with HIV will develop wasting. With the advent of HAART, the incidence of AIDS wasting has decreased. However, the prevalence of wasting at the time of AIDS diagnosis has increased. The weight loss is typically lean muscle mass, which has a dramatic impact on quality of life. This loss of muscle mass is associated with increased mortality, accelerated disease progression, and impaired functioning. Many strategies have been developed to treat HIV wasting. Nutritional counseling and dietary supplements are effective in increasing fat free mass. Additionally, specific supplementation of l-glutamine, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, and l-arginine have been shown to increase lean muscle mass. Growth hormone and testosterone increase lean body mass, but these treatments have significant side effects. Some evidence shows anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies increase weight, but these agents present safety concerns in immunocompromised individuals. Resistance exercise provides significant increases in lean body mass as well as strength. Regimens vary, but typically they consist of a three-times-a-week regimen with a clearly defined number of repetitions and percent of maximal output for each repetition.
