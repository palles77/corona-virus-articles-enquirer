These well known RNA thermometers are structures, whether matched or mismatched, which are represented by either a single stretched hairpin structure or a few hairpins. Based on computer and thermodynamic analyses of 25 isolates of Salmonella enterica with complete genome, we have developed an algorithm and criteria to search for potential RNA thermometers, which will enable us to undertake a future search for potential riboswitches in the genomes of other socially significant pathogens. In addition to the well known 4U RNA thermometer, another four hairpin loop structures have been iden tified in S. enterica as new potential RNA thermometers and two of them are localized in 5' UTR of virulence regulators gltB and yaeQ. They are highly conserved noncanonical structures and correspond to the necessary and sufficient conditions for forming RNA thermometers, since they are found in each of the 25 S. enterica genome isolates. We analyzed the thermosensitive motif in the pXO1 plasmid of Bacillus anthracis-an anthrax causative pathogen-and visualized matched hairpins that form a cruciform structure in pUC8 supercoiled plasmid by atomic force microscopy.",

To counteract the con sequences of temperature fluctuations, bacteria have developed a complex network of defense mechanisms. The potential thermosensitive elements used in nature include components from membranes to DNA, RNA, and protein molecules. Pathogenic microorganisms often respond to temperatures reaching 37\u00b0C by inducing virulence gene expression. The genes that control the sensitivity to the environment may be reg ulated at the transcription level through the interac tion of regulatory proteins. However, a few posttran scriptional mechanisms based on RNA molecules were recently discovered [3] . Some tRNA molecules are known to be not only a substrate for ribosomes but also to include controlling elements that modulate their own expression in a condition dependent way.

Tem perature is one of the RpoS controlled surrounding environment key parameters, while DsrA Bb -a small non coding RNA molecule-regulates the increase in the amount of RpoS, caused by a temperature shift. Lybecker et al. [6] formulated a hypothesis that DsrA Bb is stable as a secondary structure at t = 23\u00b0C, at which base pairing with the rpoS transcript does not take place. At increasing the temperature, a small RNA molecule secondary structure becomes degraded due to melting which leads to the binding of the anti SD rpoS mRNA fragment. This may stimulate transla tion under virulent conditions (37\u00b0C) through the with drawal of the SD sequence and the translation initiation site from the secondary structure in rpoS mRNA.",

We used the following main criteria for the potential RNA thermometers: (a) the melting temper ature for hairpins is within the range from 32 (at ionic strength of 0.1 M Na + ) to 43\u00b0C (at physiological ionic strength); (b) the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is com pletely or partly localized in the stem of the hairpin structure; (c) the start codons are the canonical AUG codon (ATG for DNA) which ensures that more than 90% of all encoded sequences start in prokaryotes, as well as the alternative GUG and UUG codons (GTG and TTG for DNA) [17] . The well known RNA thermometers are structures represented by either a single stretched hairpin or sev eral hairpin loop structures, which may be either per fect or imperfect. As the NMR research results have shown, a hairpin stem that has a ROSE element includes several noncanonical base pairs [18] ; there fore, we have analyzed both perfect and imperfect hairpin loop structures in our search of hypothetical RNA thermometers.",

The model of supercoiled pUC8 DNA possess ing a cruciform structure is presented in Fig. 3 . There are several variants of the hairpin forming for cruci. For example, the hairpin may be formed by both complementary inverted repeats of one strand and repeats belonging to complementary DNA strands.

We earlier visualized RNA trascripts, immobilized on mica, which formed rod like condensed structures 122 \u00b1 10 nm in length with a length-width ratio of 4.5-5 [31] . We think that, for visualizing stretched uncondensed RNA molecules that contain hairpin loop structures, it is necessary to change the surface properties of the substrate (mica). The noted morphological specifici ties of AFM visualized RNA molecules can be explained by a significant effect of the surface proper ties of the mica where RNA transcripts are immobi lized. The surface properties of the substrate are in turn determined by the hydrophobicity and density of the cations localized on the mica surface. The point is that the same mica was used for visualizing both RNA and DNA molecules, i.e., the mica possessing the hydrophobicity and surface density of cations at which linear and supercoiled double stranded DNA mole cules do not form condensed structures when immo bilized on the mica surface but are characterized by an uniform distribution of DNA fragments. We have established earlier that even insignificant changes in the hydrophobicity and density of cations on the mica surface lead to significant modifications in the mor phology of immobilized DNA molecules [32] [33] .",

            "text": "It is sufficiently difficult to predict for many 5' UTR sequences the possibility of their functioning as RNA thermometers. To confirm the functioning of a hairpin loop structure as a thermosensor, it is neces sary to undertake some experiments, for example, in vivo testing of the efficiency of the reporter gene expression at various temperatures or melting the hair pin loop structure (which contains the SD conse quence). The real melting temperature of the deter mined RNA thermometers is measured, for example, Vol. 47 No. 5 2013 POTENTIAL THERMOSENSITIVE RIBOSWITCHES 273 using circular dichroism spectroscopy or UV spectros copy. Since the melting temperature of nucleic acids depends on the ionic strength, it is considered in assessing the thermodynamic parameters of thermom eters that the concentration of Mg 2+ ions within the 1-2 mM interval corresponds to the physiological value inside bacterial cells.",

A comparison of the functioning effi CYTOLOGY AND GENETICS Vol. 47 No. 5 2013 ciencies of 12 synthetic RNA thermometers, con ducted by the authors of paper [11] under physiological conditions, has shown that the indicated RNA thermom eter (Fig. 4c) is one of the two RNA thermometers that most efficiently control the temperature dependent expression of the lacZ gene encoding \u03b2 galactosidase in E. coli [11] . Our potential RNA thermometers (Fig. 4 ) significantly differ in their secondary structure. Although RNA thermometers are characterized by a small loop (4-5 nucleotides), the experimentally con firmed RNA thermometer (Fig. 4c) has a rather large loop, although all found hairpin structures have a per fect stem. Since it has been established in [11] that sig nificantly differing hairpins equally efficiently switch on/off gene expression, we can expect that other hairpin structures (Fig. 4) will also be able to play the role of RNA thermometers.",

In general, any theoretical studies can be considered successful only after their experimental testing. Therefore, within a pilot project, we conducted preliminary experimental studies in the Salmonella enterica genome for testing a series of RNA thermometers, which we had theoretically determined before. We cloned synthesized nucleotide sequences of potential RNA thermometers into E. coli cells close to the 5' end of the gene that encodes GFP and conducted several preliminary experiments with temperature shifts, observing the changes in the fluorescence of the GFP protein in E. coli. At temperature shifts from 22 to 37\u00b0C, a weak GFP induction was recorded but not so strong as observed for synthetic RNA thermometers during temperature controlled gene expression in bacteria.",
