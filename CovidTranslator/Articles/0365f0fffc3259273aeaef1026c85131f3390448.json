Conformational neutralizing epitopes of group A and group B monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have previously been mapped to two domains at amino acids 351 to 403 (domain I) and amino acids 517 to 621 (domain II). To further map antigenic sites, neutralization escape mutants of BCV were selected with a group A MAb which has both in vitro and in vivo virus-neutralizing ability. The escape mutants were demonstrated to be neutralization resistant to the selecting group A MAb and remained sensitive to neutralization by a group B MAb. In radioimmunoprecipitation assays, the spike proteins of neutralization escape mutants were shown to have lost their reactivities with the selecting group A MAb. Sequence analysis of the spike protein genes of the escape mutants identified a single nucleotide substitution of C to T at position 1583, resulting in the change of alanine to valine at amino acid position 528 (A528V). The mutation occurs in domain II and in a location which corresponds to the hypervariable region of the spike protein of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus. Experimental introduction of the A528V mutation into the wild-type spike protein resulted in the loss of MAb binding of the mutant protein, confirming that the single point mutation was responsible for the escape of BCV from immunological selective pressure.",

Electron microscopic studies indicate that the S protein forms the club-shaped structures on the surface of the coronavirus virion (31) . For BCV, the S protein is cleaved at amino acid positions 768 and 769 to form two subunits (1): S1 represents the N-terminal half of the S protein and S2 represents the C-terminal half of the protein. The S protein has several important functions including binding of the virus to susceptible cells (4, 6, 22, 28) , mediation of membrane fusion (both viruscell and cell-cell fusion) (6, 35, 36, 42) , and induction of neutralizing antibody responses in the host species (10, 17, 22, 24, 37) .",

It was proposed that this fragment spans amino acid positions 351 to 621 on the S1 subunit on the basis of an analysis of the fragments generated with three proteolytic enzymes (11, 40) . Deletion mapping studies have identified that both group A and group B conformational epitopes consist of two domains located within amino acid residues 324 to 403 and 517 to 720 (40) . Since this is in general agreement with the proposed location of the 37K-molecularweight trypsin fragment, amino acids residues 351 to 403 (domain I) and 517 to 621 (domain II) are thought to contain the critical amino acids of these epitopes (40) .

Tenfold dilutions of the passaged virus were then incubated with a 1:100 dilution of MAb HB10-4 or without antibody and were propagated in the plaque assay to confirm an MAb resistance phenotype and to generate plaque-purified (subcloned) mutant viruses.

Both domains lie within the S1 subunit of the S protein, and domain II overlaps sequences of the corresponding hypervariable region of the MHV S protein (amino acid positions 456 to 592 in BCV). To dissect the neutralizing epitope recognized by group A MAb HB10-4, mutant BCVs resistant to the neutralizing MAb were generated. From a total of 30 plaques picked from residual virus after incubation of the wild-type BCV with MAb HB10-4, 13 viable viruses were obtained after three passages in cell culture. All of these viable viruses were of the MAb-resistant (mar) phenotype and after incubation with a 1:100 dilution of MAb HB10-4 had titers which were within 10-fold of the titers obtained without MAb. In contrast, the titer of wild-type BCV was reduced by greater than 1,000-fold after incubation with MAb HB10-4. Initial titers of the mar mutants ranged from 1 \u03eb 10 4 to 5 \u03eb 10 6 /ml. Four viruses (HBm1, HBm5, HBm9, and HBm13) which gave a range of low to high titers were selected for further study. One of these (HBm9) with the lowest titer also initially showed plaques with a smaller morphology. However, after propagation of the subcloned virus, HBm9 demonstrated plaques whose sizes were similar to those of other mar mutants. The reason for the apparent change was not ascertained.",

It is interesting that this mutation occurs within the region of domain II which overlaps the hypervariable region of the MHV S1 protein (Fig.  3A, and B) . Furthermore, comparison of the sequence with those of different strains of MHV shows that the mutated codon occurs in a region of sequence that is deleted in MHV JHM and MHV A59.

Since the sequence of the mar mutants was determined for nucleotide positions 972 to 2160 of the S1 gene only, it was conceivable that mutations other than that coding for amino acid residue 528 may have occurred in other regions of the S1 gene and may be responsible or partially responsible for the loss of antibody reactivity. To exclude this possibility, we introduced the same mutation into the full-length S1 gene of wild-type BCV. By site-directed mutagenesis, the C at nucleotide position 1583 was precisely replaced by T to alter the codon of GCC for alanine to GTC for valine at amino acid position 528 to create the mutant A528V S1 gene. Thus, the mutant A528V S1 protein would be identical to the wild-type full-length S1 protein except for the single amino acid at position 528. Both the wild-type S1 gene and the A528V S1 gene were individually expressed in cells with the T7 vaccinia virus expression system, and the cell lysates were subjected to RIPA with MAb HB10-4 or MAb BB7-14 (Fig. 4) . As observed, the A528V mutant S1 protein was precipitated by MAb BB7-14 (Fig. 4, lane 4) . In contrast, the mutant protein was not recognized by MAb HB10-4 (Fig. 4, lane 3 ), although the MAb was able to precipitate the wild-type S1 protein (Fig. 4, lane 2) . These results demonstrate that the amino acid change of alanine to valine at position 528 was sufficient to confer resistance to the HB10-4 mar mutants.",

Amid the clustering of sequence variation in the region, the alanine at position 528 and the surrounding sequence from amino acids 511 to 530 are fully conserved among all BCV strains and isolates sequenced to date, suggesting that functional constraints may exist for this portion of the polymorphic region. The polymorphic region contains 15 conserved cysteine residues, a large number for its size, many of which are likely involved in disulfide linkages and confer a complex structure. Our analysis of the region for respiratory and enteric BCVs reveals that only three amino acid changes occur consistently between the two groups; two of these are conservative substitutions at amino acid positions 510 and 578 (serine and threonine are interchanged). The third change, a nonconservative change between groups, occurs very close to critical residue 528 identified in this study at amino acid position 531, where an aspartic acid or asparagine residue occurs in enteric BCV isolates and a glycine occurs in respiratory BCV isolates.",
