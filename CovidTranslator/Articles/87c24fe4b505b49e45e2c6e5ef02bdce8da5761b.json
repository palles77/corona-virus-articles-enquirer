In particular, SARS presented a sociopsychological and economic threat to European Chinese communities because of their close links with the outbreak's origins. Methods A qualitative study was conducted among Chinese residents in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to identify the origins of SARS risk perceptions and their impact on precautionary actions and adverse consequences from the perspective of vulnerable communities living in unaffected regions. Analysis was informed by protection motivation theory. Results Results revealed that information from affected Asia influenced risk perceptions and protective behavior among the Chinese in Europe when more relevant local information was absent. When high risk perceptions were combined with low efficacy regarding precautionary measures, avoidancebased precautionary action appeared to dominate responses to SARS. These actions may have contributed to the adverse impacts of SARS on the communities. Conclusions Experiences of European Chinese communities suggest that practical and timely information, and consistent implementation of protective measures from central governments are essential to protect vulnerable populations in unaffected regions from unnecessary alarm and harm during outbreaks of emerging infections.",

This theory posits that information about a health threat evokes two cognitive processes: the formation of risk perceptions and appliance of protective behavior. The formation of risk perceptions is a process of \"threat appraisal\" of perceived severity and the likelihood of threat to the individual-both need to be elevated for a high risk perception to occur. Only those with a high risk perception will take precautionary actions but individuals need to believe such actions are effective (response efficacy) and that they are personally able to undertake such actions (self-efficacy). Information-seeking about a risk's severity and vulnerability is an essential part of this process [10, 11] . Intentions to implement protective actions, however, can be weakened by the perceived costs of the advocated risk-reducing behavior and the perceived benefits of the risk-enhancing behavior. As a consequence, people with high response efficacy could have low selfefficacy and would not adopt protective behavior.",

Sources of information that used Chinese languages, were in-depth, updated, and demonstrated proximity to the outbreak were preferred by most respondents. These sources included major Chinese language media (newspapers published in Europe, satellite TV, and popular Internet news websites based in China and elsewhere), public health agency websites for affected regions (such as Hong Kong's Department of Health), and interpersonal and familial social networks. Although the initial cover-up of the outbreak in mainland Chinese media caused panic among communities, a drastic improvement of coverage and measures boosted confidence in this source, in particular sources from the regions of China that people originated from. Major local European language media (TV, newspapers, and Internet news websites) and websites of health authorities such as WHO were used by English/Dutch-speaking respondents. Nevertheless, mass media coverage of SARS from and about both affected Asia and unaffected Europe was regarded as exaggerated and sensational. Respondents expressing this view recalled that images of orientallooking people wearing face masks dominated both Asian and local European mass media, which initiated a feeling of fear. Different focuses in media coverage were noted and an impression of a racialized discourse in European media was recalled. For example, the Asian media were associated with regularly updated death and infection bulletin tolls, implementation of protective measures, and the sacrifices made by the health workers. Memories of European media coverage focused on travel warnings, alarmist predications about the global spread, and blame on the Chinese government's handling of the outbreak. Awareness of information available from British and Dutch public health organizations was low among the group participants. Lack of information in Chinese languages from these sources was identified as a reason for using communications intended for infected regions, for example, WHO and Hong Kong's Department of Health websites, rather than local public health agencies. Such a perceived gap was described as:",

Similarly, avoiding visitors or returned families and friends was considered to be harmful to relationships. Therefore, although masks were stored by some respondents, they were mainly worn on visits to affected regions and during flights.

Our research supports that global information sources, especially those with sensational and racialized tendencies, were influential in the levels of vulnerability perceived among communities originating from affected regions. In the absence of timely, locally relevant, and practical guidance, precautionary advice intended for affected regions appeared to be absorbed by these communities. Furthermore, the group discussion data gave indications that the relationship between efficacy and behavior was mediated by expectations of stigmatizing social consequences that precautionary actions such as wearing face masks might attract. These factors led to the adoption of avoidancebased risk reduction strategies that may have contributed to the adverse economic, social, and psychological impacts on Chinese communities in Europe during the SARS outbreak. Respondent's perceptions that the mass media coverage of SARS in Europe was sensational and racialized are supported by findings from media content analyses. Studies reveal that mass media in Western countries tended to portray SARS in terms of the seriousness of the disease and use a \"threat\" theme that was negatively contextualized with China and the Chinese [16, [22] [23] [24] [25] , thus contributing to public fear about China, Chinatowns, and the Chinese presence in public. The experiences recalled by our respondents support the conclusions of other studies that suggest information originating from sites associated with the location of the outbreak where ethnic communities had close links is important in forming risk perceptions and the nature of precautionary actions [16] . This suggests that greater coordination with global media providers is required in the production of risk communications. Production of communications intended for unaffected regions needs to acknowledge that these communications might be undermined by seemingly conflicting information from affected regions that might be absorbed by migrant communities.",

Moreover, our study suggests that, in the process of appraising threats and appropriate behavior, Chinese values, cultural environments, religious or life attitudes, and personal circumstances can play a role in different perceptions and coping styles. Similar conclusions were drawn which suggest that such factors helped to explain the differences in preventive behaviors of the Chinese during SARS [27, 28] . Our study findings regarding efficacy correspond with the results of the survey of Chinese residents [29] that confirm low levels of selfefficacy and response efficacy in this group when compared to the general population in affected regions that took part in the international survey [30] . It further indicates that, for potentially effective measures to be implemented, risk communications need to be grounded in social norms.",

This study demonstrates that even if the Chinese population are prone to lower risk perceptions compared to the general British and Dutch populations, as the survey revealed [29] but due to the nature of such data, unable to explain, information needs will still be high and harmful behavior can occur. More importantly, in the absence of credible information from relevant authoritative sources, less relevant sources such as rumor and gossip will be used to fill the knowledge gap, as Kapferer [32] and Sj\u00f6berg [33] pointed out. Our findings indicate that clear guidance and consistent implementation of protective measures from central governments is essential to prevent unnecessary, inappropriate, and even harmful behavior taken by the communities.",

However, close links formed with key informants and purposive recruitment ensured inclusion of respondents with diverse SARS experiences.

More importantly, despite the challenges of communicating risk to ethnic minority populations who use diverse global information sources, a coordinated response from global media and national authorities will be essential. At a minimum, authorities in unaffected areas need to be able to communicate with information providers outside their own countries of jurisdiction and not rely on national outlets alone, as these will not reach population subgroups that regularly access media from their home countries. Similarly, broadcasts from affected regions need to acknowledge that they are likely to have an audience from unaffected regions who are also seeking advice and guidance. Accurate, timely, and transparent provision of information is critical for containing the outbreak and reducing public fear and uncertainty in response to new and emerging infections such as SARS in a global scope, not only in affected regions. In order to minimize adverse effects on vulnerable populations in unaffected regions during future outbreaks, needs assessment is required to map out the scope and nature of potential threats (physical, economic, and sociopsychological) and to assess the communication channels responsible for contributing to both risk perceptions and perceived efficacy of precautionary actions.",
