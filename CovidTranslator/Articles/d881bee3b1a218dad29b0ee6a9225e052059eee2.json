In vivo pathogenicity of the IBV isolate HH06 was determined by inoculating specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. The clinical signs and related gross lesions of HH06 infected chickens were similar with those of the field-infected chickens. SPF embryonated eggs were inoculated with virus suspension for serial passage and their genomic RNA was extracted. RT-PCR technique was utilized to amplify the M gene sequence encoding membrane protein of IBV. Recombinant plasmid named T-vector-M was constructed via inserting the M gene into the TA cloning vector, pMD 18-T. The sequenced M gene and its deduced amino acid (aa) sequences were compared with the published sequences of reference strains. The M gene is of 687 bp in length encoding the M protein of 228 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 25.4 kDa. The sequences of the M gene and M protein share 83.9-97.9% and 83.6-96.5% homologous identities, respectively, compared with 29 IBV reference strains derived from different regions or countries, which revealed that there are still significant variations between strains. Furthermore, a phylogenetic tree based on these M DNA sequences was generated, and the tree topology suggests that some Chinese IBV strains may have a common ancestor; however, HH06 is a new local IBV isolate that is responsible for the field outbreak of nephritis.",

IB has been reported frequently in China since it first appeared in 1965 [1] , although some vaccines have been adopted. The variation of serotypes of prevalent IBV may decrease the effect of some IBV vaccines used in some countries. Currently, the Chinese IBV isolates H120 and H52 are commonly used vaccine strains in China. The application of these vaccines in most of the chicken farms has decreased the large-scale outbreak of IB in China, however, the sporadic occurrences of IB are reported frequently. The primary target of IBV is the respiratory tract, and some isolates also replicate in the kidney and oviduct, resulting in nephritis and reduced egg production, respectively [2] .",

However, the IBV S1 region displays very distinctive difference with the vaccine strain H120 that is used for vaccination in northeastern China. There are several papers describing the epidemic situation regarding IBV in China, based on the S1 gene sequences [18] [19] [20] [21] . Evidently, the genotypic and phenotypic characterization of IBV is important for analyzing IBV variations [22] . In this paper, we further characterized the IBV isolate and cloned the M gene. The phylogenetic relationships among the IBV isolates derived from different countries or regions were investigated by sequence comparison and phylogenetic tree topology. This study provides useful information of a Chinese isolate of IBV, which may assist in elucidating the genetic evolution of IBV in China.",

The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the M gene of strain HH06 were compared with the reference strains derived from different regions or countries. The homology of the HH06 M gene shared 83.9-97.9% and 83.6%-96.5% sequence identity with the 29 IBV reference isolates at the nucleotide level and at the amino acid level, respectively ( Table 3 ). The amino acid sequence alignment showed that various sequences of IBV isolates were of unequal length (data not shown).

In our previous report, we cloned and analyzed the S1 gene of the isolate HH06 [26] . The HH06 isolate showed high sequence identity with some of the published IBV isolates, particularly some nephropathogenic IBVs. The current study indicated that HH06 was the causative agent of chicken nephritis that was responsible for the field outbreak recently. Nephropathogenic IBV usually damages kidneys and reproductive tract of chicken, causing a high mortality rate in young flocks. Currently the major control measures of IB are vaccination of live attenuated IBV vaccine (Mass serotypes) such as H52, H120, and Ma5 strains in China; however, the chicken flocks vaccinated with the live vaccines usually fail to present full protection to field virulent IBV challenge, and the vaccinated chicken flocks were often subjected to the attack of nephropathogenic IBV. [25] . In our study, the nephropathogenic IBV isolate HH06 was also isolated from a chicken flock vaccinated with live attenuated vaccine (H120 strain) and experiencing IBV infection, supporting the notion that Mass serotype of live attenuated IBV vaccine might be not ideal in protection of chickens in some places in China.",

The emerging of IBV HH06 supports the notion that variant IBV isolates can be obtained from vaccinated birds because cross neutralization does not occur between different serotypes. Because both sequence comparison and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that HH06 had a distant relation to H120, we believe that the local prevalence of HH06 may be attributed to the failure of traditional viral vaccine. In addition, our animal experiments show that kidney injury is one of the serious signs of IBV-infected chicken.",

Many aspects of IBV have been extensively studied [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] .

In the future, we will express the M gene to further analyze its biological function of the M protein and develop optimal reagents for serological diagnosis.

Most American IBV isolates were also located in neighbored branches. Interestingly, many Chinese IBV isolates that were from different places shared the same branch. For example, SAIBK isolated from Sichuan Province, partridge/GD/S14/2003 and LDT3 isolated from Guangdong Province, and HH06 isolated in Northern China shared the same branch and displayed closer relationships. This result, together with the sequence comparison, allows us to hypothesize that some Chinese IBV isolates may have a common ancestor, although they were isolated from the different regions in mainland China. Particularly, it should be noted that the IBV LDT3 is a peafowl isolate [19, 36] . However, the distinctive dissimilarity between many Chinese isolates and the widely used IBV vaccine strain such as H120 and H52 also indicates that the antigenic drift is likely to occur among some Chinese IBV strains under the long-term immune pressure.",
