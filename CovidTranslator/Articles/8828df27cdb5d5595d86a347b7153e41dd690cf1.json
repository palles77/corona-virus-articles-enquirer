While several therapeutic options have shown great potential, 30 developing a wider breadth of countermeasures would increase our efforts to combat 31 the highly lethal EBOV. Here we show that human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide 32 (AMP) LL-37 and engineered LL-37 AMPs inhibit the infection of recombinant virus 33 pseudotyped with EBOV glycoprotein (GP) and the wild-type EBOV. These AMPs target 34 EBOV infection at the endosomal cell-entry step by impairing cathepsin B-mediated 35 processing of EBOV GP. Furthermore, two engineered AMPs containing D-amino acids 36 are particularly potent in blocking EBOV infection in comparison with other AMPs, most 37 likely due to their resistance to intracellular enzymatic degradation. Our results identify 38",

            "text": "28 outbreaks in Central Africa underscore the need to develop effective treatment 29 strategies against EBOV. While several therapeutic options have shown great potential, 30 developing a wider breadth of countermeasures would increase our efforts to combat 31 the highly lethal EBOV. Here we show that human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide 32 (AMP) LL-37 and engineered LL-37 AMPs inhibit the infection of recombinant virus 33 pseudotyped with EBOV glycoprotein (GP) and the wild-type EBOV. These AMPs target 34 EBOV infection at the endosomal cell-entry step by impairing cathepsin B-mediated 35 processing of EBOV GP. Furthermore, two engineered AMPs containing D-amino acids 36 are particularly potent in blocking EBOV infection in comparison with other AMPs, most 37 likely due to their resistance to intracellular enzymatic degradation. Our results identify 38 AMPs as a novel class of anti-EBOV therapeutics and demonstrate the feasibility of 39 engineering AMPs for improved therapeutic efficacy. 40 INTRODUCTION 41 Ebola virus (EBOV) is a nonsegmented negative-sense RNA virus belonging to 42 the ebolavirus genus in the family Filoviridae. These viruses are highly pathogenic and 43 cause Ebola virus disease (EVD), previously referred to as Ebola hemorrhagic fever 44 with case fatality rates up to 90% (Feldmann and Geisbert, 2011, Feldmann and Kiley, 45 1999). During 2014-2016, West Africa experienced the largest EBOV outbreak in 46",

            "text": "Alarmingly, the most recent EBOV-Kivu outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the 48 Congo (DRC) has a reported 3224 confirmed and probable cases of EVD and 2152 49 deaths as of October 16 th 2019 and does not currently show signs of abating 50 (https://www.who.int/csr/don/02-may-2019-ebola-drc/en/). Currently there are no 51 approved vaccines or therapeutics to prevent or treat EVD, this fact combined with 52 these unprecedented outbreaks in recent years underscore the urgent need to develop 53 a wide variety of effective treatment strategies. 54 The current armamentarium of treatment options against EBOV primarily 55 consists of small molecules and immunotherapeutics (Edwards and Basler, 2019, King 56 et al., 2019). Of the reported small molecules that demonstrate anti-EBOV activity, the 57 nucleoside analogs BXC4430, GS-5734, and Favipriravir have shown anti-EBOV 58 activity in in vivo infection models (Bixler et al., 2018, Warren et al., 2016, Warren et al., 59 2014). Similarly, numerous reports have demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies 60 (MAbs) are effective at inhibiting infection (Brannan et al., 2019, Furuyama et al., 2016, 61 Howell et al., 2017, King et al., 2019, Marzi et al., 2012, Pettitt et al., 2013, Qiu et al., 62 2012, Audet et al., 2014). These MAbs target the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) which acts 63 as an attachment factor, binding the host receptor Neimann-Pick C1 (NPC1), and 64 mediating viral-host cell membrane fusion within the endosomal compartment (Davey et 65 al., 2017, Carette et al., 2011, Cote et al., 2011, Hunt et al., 2012",

            "text": "GF-17 and GI-20 containing the native sequences for 17BI and GI-20d, 111 respectively, were derived from the major antimicrobial region of LL-37 (Li et al., 2006, 112 Wang et al., 2008). Peptide 17BI was engineered with three D-form amino acids and 113 two biphenylalanines based on the sequence of GF-17 (Wang et al., 2014). GI-20d is a 114 novel peptide engineered with all D-form amino acids with identical sequence to GI-20.115Peptide RI-10 is an inactive LL-37 derivative with only 10 amino acids, serving as a116    negative control(Wang, 2008).117 Hela cells were infected with VSV-eGP viruses together with individual AMPs (at 118 5 \u00b5M) or an EBOV neutralizing mAb 13C6 as a positive control. At 20 hours post-119 infection, cells were harvested for flow cytometry analysis to determine percentages of 120 cells positive for GFP as the measurement of VSV-eGP infection. Parent LL-37 and 121 engineered AMPs (except the negative control RI-10), displayed different degrees of 122 inhibitory effects on VSV-eGP infection (Figure 2A). Peptides 17BI and GI-20d were 123 most potent in inhibiting VSV-eGP infection with over 80% inhibition at 5 \u00b5M, while 124 peptides LL-37, GF-17, and GI-20 led to 20-44% inhibition under the same condition 125 (Figure 2A). All these peptides showed dose-dependent inhibition of VSV-eGP infection 126 in Hela cells (Figure 2B). 127 Because human macrophages are a primary target during natural EBOV 128 infection, we next examined whether these AMPs inhibit VSV-eGP infection in human 129 primary macrophages (Bray and Geisbert, 2005, Gupta et al., 2007). CD14 + monocytes 130 were freshly purified from human blood samples and differentiated to macrophages by 131 treatment with macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (Murray et al., 2014). 132 Macrophages were then infected with VSV-eGP together with mAb 13C6 or AMPs. 133 Similar to the results in Hela cells, all the AMPs (except the RI-10 negative control) 134 displayed dose-dependent inhibition of VSV-eGP infection in macrophages, (Figure 135 2C). Peptides 17BI and GI-20d were the most potent and almost completely inhibited 136 VSV-eGP infection in macrophages at 10 \u00b5M (Figure 2C). We next determined the half-137 maximal concentration of inhibition (IC 50 ) and half-maximal concentration of cell toxicity 138 (TC 50 ) of these AMPs in Hela cells and primary macrophages. All the AMPs displayed 139 lower IC 50 concentrations in Hela cells than in macrophages although they also 140 displayed slightly lower TC 50 concentrations in Hela cells than in macrophages (Figure 141 2D). Among the parent LL-37 and its engineered variants, peptide GI-20d had the most 142 favorable therapeutic window in both Hela cells and primary macrophages (with an IC 50 143 of 0.99 \u00b5M and TC 50 of 18.8 \u00b5M in Hela cells and an IC 50 of 2.2 \u00b5M and TC 50 of more 144 than 30 \u00b5M in macrophages). Peptide 17BI also had a favorable therapeutic window 145 with an IC 50 of 0.71 \u00b5M and TC 50 of 13.2 \u00b5M in Hela cells and an IC 50 of 5.6 \u00b5M and 146 TC 50 of more than 30 \u00b5M in macrophages (Figure 2D). We also examined the effects of 147 AMPs on VSV-eGP infection in Vero cells, a cell line commonly used for propagating 148 viruses and in analyzing virus infection. Similarly, the parent LL-37 and its engineered 149 variants (except the negative control RI-10) displayed dose-dependent inhibition of 150 VSV-eGP infection in Vero cells (Figure S1, panels A and B). In agreement with our 151 findings in Hela cells and primary macrophages, 17BI and GI-20d were the most potent 152 peptides in inhibition of VSV-eGP infection in Vero cells. Both peptides almost 153 completely inhibited VSV-eGP infection at concentrations \u2265 5 \u00b5M in Vero cells (Figure 154 S1, panels A and B).155 Taken together, our data show that engineered LL-37 variant peptides 17BI and 156 GI-20d are potent inhibitors of EBOV pseudovirion infection in Hela and Vero cells as 157 well as in human primary macrophages. 158 159 Engineered AMPs inhibit wild-type EBOV-Kiwit infection 160 Given the observed potency of AMP's within our surrogate EBOV system, we next 161 tested whether these AMPs have similar effects on wild-type (WT) EBOV infection. Hela 162 cells were pre-incubated with AMPs at different concentrations for 2 hrs and then 163 infected with EBOV-Kiwit. At 24 hrs post-infection, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and 164 immuno-stained with an anti-EBOV GP antibody followed by a fluorescence-conjugated 165 secondary antibody to identify infected cells. In agreement with our EBOV pseudovirion 166 studies, engineered peptides 17BI and GI-20d displayed much higher potency in 167 blocking the infection of WT EBOV than the peptides containing only L-amino acids, 168 GF-17 and GI-20 (Figure 3A). Peptides 17BI and GI-20 had an IC 50 of 3 \u00b5M and 1.6 169 \u00b5M, respectively, while GF-17 and GI-20d both had an IC 50 of about 20 \u00b5M (Figure 3B). 170 Interestingly, these AMPs did not significantly affect Marburg virus (MARV) infection 171 under the same conditions, demonstrating the specificity of AMPs in inhibiting EBOV 172 infection (Figure S2). The inhibitory effects of engineered AMPs on WT EBOV infection 173 further support the finding that engineered AMPs may be a new class of anti-EBOV 174 countermeasures and highlights the consistency between WT EBOV and the surrogate AMPs inhibit EBOV cell entry but not viral replication 178 To determine potential mechanisms responsible for the inhibitory effects of LL-37-179 derived AMPs on EBOV infection, we next examined whether these AMPs targeted 180 EBOV cell entry by comparing the effects of pretreatment or delayed AMP treatment of 181 cells prior to viral infection. As previously observed (Figure 2C), AMPs 17BI and GI-182 20d, but not LL-37, GF-17, or GI-20, reduced VSV-eGP infection in human primary 183 macrophages with over 40% inhibition at 5 \u00b5M when added at the time of infection 184 (Figure 4A). Pre-treatment of macrophages with 17BI and GI-20d for 4 hrs prior to viral 185 infection blocked VSV-eGP infection with similar efficacy (Figure 4A). However, 186 delayed treatment of macrophages with 17BI and GI-20d peptides resulted in a time-187 dependent reduction of effects, with approximately 20% of inhibition when added at 4 188 hrs post-infection and a complete loss of inhibition when added at 8 hrs post infection 189 (Figure 4A). These data suggested that engineered AMP peptides may target the early 190 cell entry stage of EBOV infection. Similar results were observed for Vero cells (Figure 191 S1, panel C). 192 We next used Ebola virus-like particles (VLPs) to directly test the effects of AMPs 193 on EBOV cell entry. Ebola VLPs were produced by co-expressing the EBOV matrix 194 protein VP40 (fused to \u03b2-lactamase) and the EBOV GP. The VLPs possess a structure 195 and biochemical composition similar to the WT EBOV, but unlike the WT virus, lack 196 genetic materials for virus replication. The activities of cytoplasmic \u03b2-lactamase thus 197 represent the relative levels of productive cell entry of Ebola VLPs. Vero cells were pre-198 incubated with AMPs or a cathepsin B (CatB) specific inhibitor (as a positive control) 199 followed by Ebola VLP infection. CatB inhibitor and peptides 17BI and GI-20d displayed 200 dose-dependent inhibition of cytoplasmic \u03b2-lactamase activity, providing direct evidence 201 that engineered AMPs inhibit productive EBOV cell entry (Figure 4B). 202 After entering the cytoplasm, EBOV undergoes replication to amplify its genetic 203 material in order to produce progeny virions. In the absence of WT virus, replication can 204 be studied using an EBOV mini-genome system (Cressey et al., 2017). We next 205 examined the effects of AMPs on EBOV replication using this system. The EBOV 206 minigenome plasmids (encoding firefly luciferase reporter gene flanked by the leader 207 and trailer sequences from EBOV genome) were co-transfected into Hela cells with four 208 supporting plasmids encoding EBOV replication complex components NP, L, VP35, and 209 VP30 and a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase (for normalization of transfection 210 efficiency). The ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase represented the relative levels of 211 EBOV minigenome replication. None of the tested AMPs (at 5 \u00b5M) led to a significant 212 change of the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase, while the positive control Ribavirin 213 significantly reduced the ratio (Figure 4C). Our data suggest that LL-37 and its 214 engineered variants do not affect EBOV replication in the mini-genome system. 215 Collectively, the results suggest that engineered LL-37 variant peptides, 17BI and 216 GI-20d, block EBOV cell entry, but not viral replication. 217 218 LL-37 and engineered AMPs block CatB-dependent processing of EBOV-GP 219 Productive EBOV cell entry and infection requires the processing and cleavage of 220 EBOV-GP by cathepsins within the endosome. We therefore next tested whether AMPs 221 block CatB and CatL-mediated cleavage of EBOV-GP. CatB was pre-incubated with 222 AMPs or a known CatB inhibitor (CA-074 methyl ester, as a positive control) in a pH 5.0 223 buffer before the addition of EBOV GP protein. The reaction mixture was then 224 subjected to Western blot analysis to analyze EBOV GP proteolytic cleavage. As 225 expected, EBOV GP (about 110 kD) was cleaved by CatB and generated a 19 kD 226 product in a denaturing gel (Figure 5A). CatB inhibitor and all the tested AMPs 227 (except the negative control RI-10) effectively blocked the processing of EBOV-GP by 228 CatB (Figure 5A). However, none of the tested AMPs had any effects on the 229 processing of EBOV-GP by CatL under the same conditions (Figure 5B). 230 Using standard CatB and CatL substrates, we next tested whether the AMPs 231 block the intrinsic activity of CatB and CatL. All the tested AMPs (except RI-10 232 negative control) inhibited CatB-mediated cleavage of Z-Arg-Arg-AMC in a dose-233 dependent manner (Figure S3A).

We postulated that 245 AMPs composed of L-amino acids are more susceptible to degradation by proteolytic 246 enzymes inside cells, thus reducing their availability to block CatB in vivo. To test this 247 hypothesis, we examined whether the AMPs were susceptible to CatS cleavage in an 248 in vitro reaction. CatS was used because it is the most abundant cathepsin in the 249 endosome/lysosome of macrophages and LL-37 has been shown to be an excellent 250 substrate of CatS (Shi et al., 1992, Andrault et al., 2015). All the AMPs composed of 251 L-amino acids only (LL-37, GF-17, GI-20, and RI-10) were completely degraded by 252 CatS treatment in the reaction, while AMPs containing D-amino acids (17BI and GI-253 20d) were resistant to CatS cleavage (Figure 6A). The data indicate that AMPs 254 composed of L-amino acids are susceptible to degradation by CatS upon entering 255 cells. We then hypothesized that blockage of CatS may stabilize these AMPs inside 256 cells, thus making them available to inhibit CatB-mediated EBOV entry. To test the 257 hypothesis, Vero cells were pre-treated with a CatS inhibitor for 2 hrs, followed by the 258 addition of AMPs and VSV-eGP. CatS inhibitor treatment significantly improved the 259 efficacy of LL-37, GF-17, and GI-20 by 4-10 fold in their inhibition of VSV-eGP 260 infection (Figure 6B). Notably, CatS inhibitor also improved the efficacy of 17BI and 261 GI-20d by 1.5-2 fold and CatS inhibitor treatment alone resulted in 30% inhibition of 262 VSV-eGP infection, likely due to the known ability of the inhibitor to cross-inhibit CatB. 263 Collectively, our data suggest that LL-37 AMPs are susceptible to enzymatic 264 degradation inside cells and engineered AMPs with D-amino acids are more resistant 265",

Different active regions in LL-37 have been 276 identified in previous structure-function studies (Sigurdardottir et al., 2006, Nell et al., 277 2006, Braff et al., 2005, Nagaoka et al., 2002). We have chosen GF-17 as a template 278 for further peptide engineering because GF-17 is most active against methicillin-279 resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) among active peptides discovered previously 280 (Wang, 2008). In another study, we found that GI-20 (with three amino acid-extension 281 at the N-terminus of GF-17) had increased activity in inhibiting HIV-1 (Wang et al., 282 2014). Based on GF-17 and GI-20 respectively, 17BI and GI-20d were designed with 283 incorporation of D-amino acids to enhance their biostability. 284 Interestingly, 17BI and GI-20d are found to be more effective in inhibiting EBOV 285 infection than the parent LL-37 and other derivative peptides. Previous studies have 286 shown that the 17BI peptide is more resistant to chymotrypsin, bacterial V8 protease, 287 and fungal protease K degradation than GF-17 and other peptides composed of L-288 amino acid (Wang et al., 2014). Here we show that peptides 17BI and GI-20d are more 289 resistant to degradation by CatS, a cysteine proteinase abundant in the lysosomes of 290 macrophages, dendritic cells, and some epithelial cells (Shi et al., 1992, Shi et al., 291 1994). In addition, pretreatment of cells with a CatS inhibitor significantly enhanced the 292 efficacy of parent LL-37 and its derivative AMPs compose of L-amino acids in inhibiting 293 EBOV infection (Figure 6). These results suggest the important role of CatS in 294 mediating the instability of LL-37-based AMPs inside cells. A previous study has295",

            "text": "inhibitor of CatL, but not CatB(Andrault et al., 2015). To address any potential 303 experimental differences, we additionally confirmed our study results using two304 independent sources of CatB and CatL (one source provided cathepsins purified from 305 the liver and the other source provided cathepsins in recombinant form). In all cases, 306 these confirmatory experiments agreed with our original results (data not shown) and 307 the commercially available CatB-and CatL-specific inhibitors performed as expected in 308 our assays (Figure S3). 309 Although endosomal cysteine proteases are required for cell entry of all filovirus 310 family members, different viruses have distinct protease preferences (Misasi et al., 311 2012). While CatB is required for EBOV cell entry, several studies suggest that MARV 312 cell entry does not require CatB although it is not clear what proteases are required 313 (Gnirss et al., 2012, Misasi et al., 2012, Sanchez, 2007). In agreement of those studies, 314 we found that none of our tested AMPs significantly inhibited MARV infection (Figure 315 S2). The two D-amino acid-containing AMPs (17BI and GI-20d) that display potent 316 inhibition of EBOV infection only have minimal inhibition of MARV infection (with an IC 50 317 of 41 \u00b5M and 25 \u00b5M, respectively). In future studies, it will be interesting to test whether 318 these AMPs also inhibit the infection of other viruses where viral cell entry involves 319 CatB, such as other filovirus family members (e.g., Bundibugyo virus) (Misasi et al., 320 2012) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory 321 Syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses (Elshabrawy et al., 2014). 322 Notably, all the LL-37 AMPs are less efficient in inhibiting EBOV infection in 323 macrophages than in Hela and Vero cells (Figure 2 and Figure S1). Two potential 324 mechanisms may explain the observation. First, as professional antigen presenting 325 cells, macrophages likely contain an abundance of proteases such as cathepsin S, 326 therefore AMP peptides are less available in macrophages to inhibit viral infection. 327Second, it is known that primary macrophages are more refractory to EBOV infection 328 compared to tissue-culture cell lines (i.e., Vero, HeLa). As such, EBOV macrophage 329 infection require a 10-fold higher MOI compared to cell lines. Therefore, it is likely that 330 an increase in the amounts of AMPs is needed to achieve similar degrees of inhibition.331Finally, it should be noted that our data is consistent with findings that EBOV 332 neutralizing antibodies, such as 13C6, demonstrate less potency with higher IC50 333 values in primary macrophages relative to cell lines.334 The current promising treatment options against EBOV primarily consists of 335 nucleoside analog small molecules and immunotherapies using neutralizing antibodies 336 (Edwards and Basler, 2019, King et al., 2019). It will be interesting to test whether the 337 combined use of engineered AMPs with those therapeutic regimens will have additive 338 efficacy, given that distinct inhibition mechanisms are involved. We anticipate that 339 combination of AMPs with small molecules that interfere with viral replication or with 340 virus-neutralizing antibodies will have improved efficacy against EBOV. 341 In summary, our study has demonstrated the inhibitory effects of engineered LL-342 37 AMPs on EBOV cell entry. Future studies will test the therapeutic potential of these 343 AMPs in well-established EBOV animal models. Because the most common route of 344 EBOV infection is through blood or other body fluids, we anticipate that I.V. injection of 345 engineered AMP peptides will be most effective although topical use of the peptides 346 could be an option to combat EBOV infection through direct skin contact. These animal 347 studies will further confirm that engineered LL-37 AMPs are a novel class of antithe mechanistic studies were performed using EBOV surrogate systems.352 Follow-up experiments using live virus in animal systems are needed to extend the 353 clinical utility of the findings.
