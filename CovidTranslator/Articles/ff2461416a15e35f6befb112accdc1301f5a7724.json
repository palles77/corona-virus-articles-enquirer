Five themes were identified through the FGDs and tested quantitatively for their prevalence with structured questionnaires. First, the GPs' role as a comprehensive care provider was (mis) interpreted as an 'all-round doctor'. Second, the GP's responsibility as the first point of care was understood in two conflicting ways: private personal doctors of the rich and the powerful or village doctors for common people. Third, referral was understood as simply guiding patients to appropriate departments within the hospital while the gatekeeping role was interpreted to involve GPs being peoples' health protectors rather than being also gatekeepers of specialty services. Traditional Chinese medicine now further complicates the understanding of GPs. And lastly, the GPs' main responsibility was considered to be public health work.",

Pursuing the quantity of GPs on its own is meaningless, since the number needed depends on the delineated role of GPs. Top priority is to establish clarity about the GP role, which requires reforming the health delivery system to address issues with fragmented care, strategically taking into account the development of GPs with work delegation and substitution and providing more clarity on the distinction between general practice and public health.",

China is not new to primary health care (PHC). Its influential barefoot doctor movement in the 1960s and 1970s served as an important inspiration for the Declaration of Alma-Ata. 3 4 However, with China's marketoriented reform since late 1970s, the barefoot doctor system gradually collapsed, and its healthcare evolved towards a system dominated by specialised hospital-based care.",

            "text": "Box 1 Three general practitioner (GP) training programmes and estimated expansion of GPs in China A GP system requires sufficient practitioners, and China's major efforts have been focused on rapid 'production' of more GPs through three programmes. The first one is the Standardised Residency Training in General Practice (GP-SRT) that follows the international standards of GP training. Nationwide compulsory residency called the standardised residency training (SRT) is new to China, and the GP-SRT is an important part of this. The SRT recruited its first cohort of residents (totalling 55 000) in late 2014 and around 10% of them (5158) joined the GP-SRT. 27 The second programme involves a Tuition-waived Rural-oriented Undergraduate Medical Programme (TRUMP). TRUMP sponsors medical students from rural China who in return assume GP positions in assigned township hospitals on completion of their studies. The first cohort of TRUMP students (in total 5000 nationally) enrolled at medical schools in 2010 and were required to join the GP-SRT in 2015. On completion of the GP-SRT, they are required to work in township hospitals as GPs for 3 years. The third programme is GP Transfer Training (GP-TT), mainly for township hospital doctors. The township hospital 'doctors', many of whom do not even have a bachelor's degree, were trained to be specialists. Doctors joining the GP-TT suspend their work to undertake full-time training for 1 year. Then they will get a certificate that allows them to be 'transferred' to GPs. The central government has provided all 22 provinces in middle and western China with funding for this short-term training programme each year since 2010. In the long run, China's newly planned GPs will be trained through 5 years of undergraduate medical studies plus the rigorous 3-year GP-SRT programme. The first two programmes represent the long-term strategy of 'producing' GPs through the 5+3 model. The third programme (GP-TT) is the interim plan. These three training programmes represent the GP capacity building efforts since the central government's formal launch of the ambitious plan in 2011. Accordingly, the trainees of these three programmes (TRUMP medical students, GP residents and township hospital doctors) are defined in this study as policy implementation targets (PIT)-the focus of our research. Through these efforts, the number of China's officially counted GPs has increased dramatically-almost 190 000 GPs in 2015 (figure 4). If this trend is sustained, there will be more than 320 000 GPs by 2020, which means approximately 2.4 GPs per 10 000 people. The ambitious plan of training 300 000 GPs and having two to three GPs per 10 000 will therefore be achieved. The first nationwide cohort of GPs following international standards will finish their residency in late 2017. Accordingly, the vast majority of China's current 200 000 GPs have been produced through the interim training programmes. Most of the township hospital doctors trained through the GP-TT choose not to change their registration on completion of the short-term GP training. After the training, they go back to work in the township hospitals as before, serving as internists, paediatricians, surgeons, and so on, though the government statistics count them as GPs ( figure 4 ). Since the current trend is driven largely by counting the number of these individuals as 'GPs', it is unlikely to truly hit the policy target.",

There is a lack of rigorous, original investigations. Due to China's size, complexity and history, its official GPs may be considerably different, in terms of training, from their counterparts in high-income countries (box 1). Moreover, a fundamental factor affecting the viability of general practice in China is how general practice is understood by prospective GPs. Our study focuses on how the three medical groups, together called the policy implementation targets (PIT; box 1), understand the new GP system. If the PITs cannot agree on what being a GP entails, this compromises the policy foundation of China's GP aspirations. Our findings help inform priorities for establishing a viable GP system in China and may provide guidance for other countries embarking on a similar trajectory.",

Henan is located in central China and represents the middle of China's 31 provincial-level jurisdictions in terms of economic development (figure 1). As the second most populous province in China, Henan is one of the key loci for the GP capacity building. For instance, the Tuition-waived Rural-oriented Undergraduate Medical Programme (TRUMP) students in Henan, a single province, account for around 10% of the whole country's TRUMP students.",

In China, most medical schools provide training in western medicine, while some provide training in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Among all the medical schools in Henan participating in the TRUMP, there was only one TCM school-Henan University of Chinese Medicine (HUCM). To represent this proportion of medical students, HUCM was selected. For the remaining 'western medicine' schools, Xinxiang Medical University was the most active participant of the TRUMP, accommodating around half of the TRUMP students in Henan. Accordingly, it was chosen and identified as a key institution to investigate TRUMP. Within the selected schools, the senior medical students were the preferred participants given their years of experience within the programme. 11 The quantitative study was expanded to cover all three PIT groups because they are all relevant to the viability of GP in China. The entire first cohort of TRUMP students (enrolled in 2010 and due to graduate in 2015) in all the medical universities in Henan participating in the TRUMP were included. Similarly, all the GP Transfer Training (GP-TT) trainees in Henan from 2014 to 2015 were surveyed.",

However, they understand the role differently. Some consider a GP's responsibility is to treat as many diseases as possible, including those beyond their capacity. The other is to just simply refer patients without any effort on their part. Participant 2 in quote 5 (table 3) has this second opinion, while participant 3, though seeming to agree with participant 2, actually shows the first view. The view that GPs simply refer patients is more evident in quote 6 (table 3). In this case, guidance is more appropriate than referral for the role mentioned, and such 'guide doctors' can be nurses. The referral function also implies GPs' gatekeeping role. They serve as the 'gate', and a gate is a barrier. According to the quantitative analysis, the vast majority of PITs (more than 90%; p=0.858) think that GPs are the gatekeepers of peoples' health (table 4), as this is clearly and widely promoted by the Chinese government. However, 'the gatekeepers of residents' health' has two interpretations-it can mean that GPs are health protectors or the gatekeepers of the healthcare system. This either reflects the government's misunderstanding of GPs or its deliberate rhetoric to avoid directly associating the GPs' role as a barrier to directly accessing tertiary care. Accordingly, agreeing with this statement does not necessarily mean the PITs understand GPs' referral role appropriately. In fact, when directly asked whether they agree that one of the GPs' main responsibilities is referral, the percentage of agreement reduces to less than 70% (table 4) .",

The TRUMP in Henan Province gives some quotas (though a relatively small proportion) to HUCM, which naturally connects 'the combination of western medicine and TCM' with general practice. This decision by the Henan health authority implies either its deliberate decision to connect China's general practice with TCM or weak regulation. As a result, medical students particularly at HUCM tend to think general practice is kind of equal to the combination of western medicine and TCM (quote 7, table 3). The quantitative analysis confirms that some PITs associate general practice with TCM (table 4). In particular, the township hospital doctors and the medical students in TCM medical universities are more likely to assert that GPs can practise both western medicine and TCM.",

Some do not agree, such as participant 1 who Open access reminds participant 7 that 'you are a doctor' which means you should do clinical work rather than paperwork. Nonetheless, participant 1's understanding of public health is not appropriate either. Great caution is needed to decipher how they interpret public health. Meanwhile, most PITs, although asserting GPs' main responsibility is public health, do not agree that GPs' main role is prevention rather than diagnosis/treatment of disease (table 4) . However, township hospital doctors are more likely than the medical students or residents surveyed to consider a GP's main role to be prevention. It is fair to say that the PITs have a vague understanding of both general practice and public health. DISCuSSIOn health delivery system and fragmented care Some of the (mis)understandings of general practice are arguably a reflection of China's health delivery system and its fragmented care. The health delivery system is dominated by powerful hospitals and a specialist practice model. In this system, even China's primary care facilities (eg, the township hospitals) follow a specialist practice model. Though they are not as specialised as tertiary hospitals, they usually have departments of internal medicine, surgery, paediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology. Township hospital doctors are trained to be 'specialists' in these departments, despite most not even having a bachelor's degree (table 2) . Consequently, it is natural for medical students and doctors to establish their professional identities as a result of their experience in the specialised departments in which they are working, rather than as a substantive reflection of specialist training received.",

This phenomenon relates to the everyday work of China's primary care doctors-the more one has exposure to the work designated as so-called 'general practice' in real life, the more confused one gets.

However, in practice, some work of GPs may inevitably overlap with many specialists, especially from an international perspective. In the UK, the primary care doctors are GPs, while in the USA they consist of family physicians (US equivalents of GPs), general internists, paediatricians, obstetricians and gynaecologists. Furthermore, many attributes of GPs such as comprehensiveness, continuity, first contact and coordination are all relative concepts-sometimes they do not necessarily and automatically distinguish GPs from specialists. For instance, some specialists with an office-based tradition in the USA (such as some cardiologists and pulmonologists) actually identify themselves as primary care physicians, 21 and some research recognises the important contribution of specialists to primary care-in particular 58.2%, 43.8% and 42.3% of the care provided by cardiologists, gastroenterologists and pulmonologists, respectively, is classified into the category of principal care which has the evidence of continuity and comprehensiveness. 22 Conversely, GPs can work in tertiary hospitals. In Canada, 90% of the hospitalists (providing comprehensive care for inpatients) are GPs. 23 Moreover, the broad care provided by GPs may overlap with allied health professionals such as nurses and community health workers. In the UK, the consultations in general practice undertaken by nurses increased from 21% in 1995 to 34% in 2006; more responsibilities previously undertaken by GPs are taken over by nurses. 20 All in all, the work delegation and substitution indicates that there are potentially various combinations of health workforce (GPs, specialists, allied health professionals, Open access and so on) to deliver PHC. Depending on these different combinations and different health delivery systems, different countries actually demand different things from general practice, as reflected by the large variation of the proportion of GPs as a percentage of each country's total number of doctors: UK 60%, Canada 51%, France 50%, Spain 37%, Netherlands 33%, Finland 32%, Denmark 25%, USA 20%, Germany 19% and Sweden 10%. 24 25 No research so far has proposed a convincing gold standard establishing the 'ideal' proportion of GPs.",

His unique opportunity to influence the social situation has its base in public confidence that his is capable of treating the sick. If this were lost he would be reduced to the position of a rather badly trained social worker. (p 924) 26 lIMITATIOn, POlICy IMPlICATIOn AnD COnCluSIOn One limitation of this paper is that it only focuses on Henan Province, which may preclude generalisation to the whole country. However, it should be noted that Henan has a population of around 100 million, larger than most countries. If Henan were an independent country, it would host the 16th largest population among sovereign nations. This 'case study' provides at least an initial view of the kinds of issues that probably arise in crafting policies for general practice in other provinces of China. In addition, this paper only provides a 'supply-side' perspective-it represents the views of medical providers. However, it is equally important to know patients' attitude towards general practice ('demand-side' perspective) and their healthcare-seeking behaviours. However, our design is first to target relevant providers who are supposed to understand GPs best. If the PITs have such understandings/interpretations of what being a GP entails, as identified in the five themes, the perspectives of the general public should be even more diverse. The foundation of China's GP-centred PHC workforce policymaking is problematic.",

This may sound easy, but actually concerns every aspect of a viable GP system. The roles and responsibilities required of GPs cannot be specified in isolation. Specialists, nurses, community health workers, public health professionals and TCM practitioners, among others, need to be coordinated. Especially, China should make sure that the paramount identity of GPs is, first, qualified doctors, and clarify pragmatically the distinction between general practice and public health. In addition, pursuing a particular indicator of policy success (eg, the number of GPs) alone can be meaningless or even counterproductive. Inserting so-called GPs into the existing hospital and specialistdominated system can lead to chaos and confusion. We recommend efforts to be directed towards reform of the whole health delivery system and fragmented care towards one which more broadly strengthens PHC.",
