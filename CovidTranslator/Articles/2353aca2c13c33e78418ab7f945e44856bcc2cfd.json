Herein, we provide data of a comparative study on optimization of transfection condition by electroporation and chemical methods for Huh 7 and Vero cells. Different cell confluencies, DNA/reagent ratios and total trans fection volumes were optimized for two chemical reagents including jetPEI TM and Lipofectamine TM 2000. Besides, the effects of electric field strength and pulse length were investigated to improve electroporation efficiency. Transfection of cells by pEGFP N1 vector and tracking the expression of GFP by FACS and Flu orescence Microscopy analysis were the employed methods to evaluate transfection efficiencies. Optimized electroporation protocols yielded 63.73 \u00b1 2.36 and 73.9 \u00b1 1.6% of transfection in Huh 7 and Vero cells respectively, while maximum achieved level of transfection by jetPEI TM was 14.2 \u00b1 0.69 and 28 \u00b1 1.11% Huh 7 and Vero cells, respectively. Post transfectional chilling of the cells did not improve electrotransfection efficiency of Huh 7 cells. Compared to chemical based reagents, electroporation showed superior levels of transfection in both cell lines. The presented protocols should satisfy most of the experimental applications requiring high transfection efficiencies of these two cell lines.",

Although currently several biological (virus mediated) and non biological (including chemical and physical) transfection methods are available, for every individ ual cell type the supreme method which should be effi cient and reproducible with minimum cell toxicity, needs to be optimized and selected experimentally through comparative studies [2] . Chemical transfec tion protocols are the most widely used methods in research which employ cationic polymers, calcium phosphate and cationic lipids with almost similar functional mechanisms [3] . Briefly, positively charged chemicals make complex with negatively charged nucleic acids and the complex subsequently is fused to the negatively charged cell membrane followed by passing through via endocytosis or phagocytosis [1, 2] . Cell confluency and reagent/DNA ratio are two main parameters that should be optimized for the cell types 1 The article is published in the original. under study when chemical transfection methods are being employed [4] . Besides, the total volume of the transfection medium is suggested to have some minor effects on the efficiency of transfection when chemical methods are being used [4] . The physical transfection methods such as gene gun or electroporation (which is the most widely used technique) make use of physical tools to deliver nucleic acids into cells [1] . Although the exact mechanism of electroporation is unknown, it is supposed that short electrical pulse makes some holes in the cell membrane through which nucleic acids can go across [5] . Since the electrical pulse induces a high degree of cell death, minimal amount of cell death as well as highest gene transfer efficiency are provided by optimization of the electric field strength and pulse length for each cell type [6] . In addition, some early studies indicated that post trans fectional chilling of the cells to 0\u00b0C [6] or utilization of electroporation buffers containing dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO 1.25%) during and for 24 h after the pulse [7] may improve transfection efficiencies.",

We also investigated if the total volume of medium per well during chemical transfection would affect the Optimization of transfection efficiency via electropo ration. According to prior studies, application of the square wave and low field strengths (500-2000 V/cm) together with long time constants (10-30 ms) pro vided the highest transfection efficiencies in mamma lian cell types [6] . Besides, low resistance buffers like PBS or culture medium are shown to be the optimal media for efficient electrotransfection of these cell types [6] . Accordingly, to obtain the condition in which cell death and electroporation efficiency are approximately equilibrated, we employed square wave form and evalu ated different low field strengths (400, 425, 450, 625, 750 V/cm corresponding to: 160, 170, 180, 250, 300 volts for a 4 mm gapped cuvette, respectively) as well as two different long pulse lengths (20 and 40 ms) for both cell lines (Fig. 2a) .

            "text": "Endocytosis is considered as the preferred route of cell entry of nonviral complexes and cargos via chem ical transfection methods [26] . The efficiency of cargo transfer by endocytic pathway itself (and therefore the transfection efficiency of chemical methods) is highly dependent on the cell line type and specific character istics of the chemical reagent (polyplex or lipoplex) used as carrier [27, 28] . Different transfection effi ciencies obtained in our study for Huh 7 and Vero cells (14.2 \u00b1 0.69% versus 28 \u00b1 1.11% respectively) in spite of employing the same reagent (jetPEI TM as a polyplex reagent) clearly indicated the effect of the cell type in utilizing different endocytic pathways. Indeed, previous findings suggested that the same chemical reagent (poly plex) may be internalized by different cell lines through various endocytic pathways leading to different transfec tion efficiencies. Of note, it is suggested that in Hela and 293 cells the caveolae dependent endocytic pathway leads to effective transfection by polyplex reagent [29] while clathrin mediated endocytosis is the main endocytic pathway in Huh 7 and COS 7 cells when the same chemical reagent (polyplex) is employed for trans fection [30] . Therefore, our results for the observed dif ferences in the transfection efficiencies between Vero and Huh 7 cells in case of polyplex reagent may be related to the different fates of this reagent through endocytic path ways in these two cell lines.",

            "text": "We also improved electroporation protocols for gene delivery into these two cell lines by optimizing the electric field strength and pulse length. In accordance with previous reports the square wave form provides higher mammalian transfection efficiencies and is widely used for in vitro and in vivo applications [31] . Therefore, square wave pulsing was employed in our study. In addition reports using electroporation to transfect mammalian cells either employed high field strengths and short pulse length or using lower field strengths and longer pulse length [31] . However, later studies showed that higher levels of expression could be obtained by the latter [6] . Our results showed that high efficiencies as well low cell death were obtained with low field strengths and long time constants con dition in both cell lines. CYTOLOGY Effect of cold treatment on electrotransfection effi ciency of Huh 7 cell was also addressed in our study. Few prior reports have indicated that post transfec tional chilling of the cells to 0\u00b0C increase the transfec tion efficiency of some cell types (apparently due to keeping the membrane pores open for longer time which subsequently provides more time for DNA to enter the cell) [6] . On the contrary immediate trans ferring of electroporated cells to pre warmed medium have been suggested for other cell types to increase cell survival (probably via helping the pores created to be resealed) [6] . Our results in accordance with the later report demonstrated that post transfectionally chill ing of the Huh 7 cells increased cell death by 40%. We also assessed the potential role of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) on electrotransfection efficiency of Huh 7 cell in our study. DMSO has been reported to enhance the transfection efficiencies of DNA introduced by polycations including polybren and DEAE [32, 33] as well as calcium phosphate method [34] . It is suggested that DMSO enhances the uptake of DNA by aug menting cell membrane permeabilization and the osmotic shock [34] . However, the concentration of DMSO for efficient transfection is critical and should be determined experimentally for each cell line. In fact optimal concentration of DMSO for one cell line may be toxic for another one. This fact was previously reported for chemical transfection of human epidermal keratinocytes and muine NIH 3T3 cells by polybrene reagent in which the optimal concentration of DMSO for highest transfection efficiencies of the cells were 27 and 15% respectively [35] . According to previous study, improvement in electrotrans fection efficiency and cell viability in four different cell lines (HL60, TR146, COS 7 and L132) using electroporation buffer containing DMSO (1.25%) during and for 24 h after the pulse was reported [7] . Accordingly in our study Huh 7 cells were electroporated in buffer (media) containing 1.25% DMSO when other param eters were kept in optimized condition. However this modification decreased the electroporation efficiency and cell survival of Huh 7 cells by 60 and 50%, respec tively (data not shown). This result was not surprising and may indicate the toxic effect of 1.25% DMSO on Huh 7 cells. Further experiments are required to access the specific concentration of DMSO for Huh 7 cells in which cell permeability increase is balanced with cell viability decrease. In addition, concentration of plasmid DNA might be an important parameter for electrotransfection efficiencies that should be deter mined experimentally for each cell type. Application of 1-10 \u00b5g plasmid was suggested in different elec trotransfection studies [6, 36] . In our study 5 \u00b5g of plasmid DNA (as a mean concentration and starting point) was used throughout all experiments. Although, it may be possible to further increase the transfection efficiencies obtained in this study by optimizing DMSO and plasmid DNA concentrations, the achieved effi ciencies (63.73 and 73.9% for Huh 7 and Vero cells, respectively) are good enough to satisfy most of the experimental applications requiring high trans fection efficiencies of these two cell types.",

The highest efficiency obtained when 20 \u00d7 10 3 cells were seeded per well and ratio was 4 \u00b5L (jetPEI TM )/2 \u00b5g (DNA) in Vero cells. Transfection efficiencies were expressed as the ratio of the GFP positive cells to total cells in the gated region. Huh 7 and Vero cells as suggested by manufacturer (www.polyplus transfection.com). To this end the transfection efficiencies among wells con taining 500, 250, 150 \u00b5L media during transfection were compared. Interestingly when results showed no significant differences in case of Lipofectamine TM 2000, in case of JetPEI TM the highest transfection effi ciencies for Huh 7 and Vero cells were obtained in wells containing 500 and 150 \u00b5L of total medium respectively with 10% variation of efficiencies within the range of the measured volumes (500, 250, 150 \u00b5L; data not shown). These results showed that the effect of total volume on transfection efficiency may depend on both the type of reagent and the cell line under study.",
