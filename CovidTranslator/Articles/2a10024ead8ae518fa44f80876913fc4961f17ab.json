            "text": "Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is an RNA virus belonging to the genus Lentivirus of the family Retroviridae. Replication of the virus is complex and involves reverse transcription of the RNA genome into a double-stranded DNA molecule or provirus, which is integrated into the host genome. HIV-1 enters the cell using CD4 as a receptor and CXCR4 or CCR5 as a coreceptor. In general, CCR5 coreceptors are found on macrophages, and CXCR4 coreceptors are found on T cells. Determining the cellular tropism of the virus has become important now that an antiretroviral drug targets the CCR5 coreceptor. The HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme does not have proofreading capabilities, leading to the significant genetic diversity of HIV-1. Several distinct genetic subtypes or clades have been identified and are categorized into three groups: major (M), outlier (O), and N (nonmajor and nonoutlier). Recently, a new group P has been identified that is closely related to a gorilla simian immunodeficiency virus. 2 The major group is divided into nine clades (AeK) and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), which are determined on the basis of sequence diversity within the HIV-1 gag and env genes. 3 Group M virus is found worldwide, with clade B predominating in Europe and North America, clade C in Africa and India, and clade E in much of Southeast Asia. The complex replication cycle and genetic diversity are two important factors that influence the design and interpretation of HIV-1 molecular assays.",

            "text": "The first HIV-1 viral load test was approved by the FDA in 1996 and rapidly became the standard of care for monitoring response to ART. Early studies found that patients who have higher viral loads progressed more rapidly to AIDS and death than those with low viral loads. [4] [5] [6] Viral load testing is now widely accepted as a marker of response to ART. The guidelines for initiation of therapy based on viral load have changed as our understanding of disease progression at higher CD4 cell counts has improved. With the availability of newer more potent and less toxic drugs, ART is recommended for all HIV-infected individuals regardless of their CD4 cell count or viral load (DHHS Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines, http://AIDSinfo.nih.gov). After treatment is initiated, viral load testing is crucial for monitoring response to therapy and should be measured in all HIV-infected individuals at the time of entry into care when therapy is initiated and at a regular interval (usually 3e4 months) while on therapy. The standard of care is to treat with a combination of antiretroviral drugs, which are classified based on their viral targets: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors, integrase inhibitors (also known as integrase strand transfer inhibitors [INSTIs] ), and CCR5 entry inhibitors. Current Department of Health and Human Services Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines (http://aidsinfo.nih. gov/guidelines) recommend an initial regimen of two NRTIs and an NNRTI, a PI, or an INSTI. The pretreatment viral load values influence the treatment regimen because some regimens are less effective in patients with high viral loads. After initiation of appropriate therapy, there is typically a 2 log 10 or greater decrease in viral load within 2 to 3 months. The goal for a patient is to achieve a viral load below the limit of detection of the most sensitive assays (20e50 copies/mL). Data have shown that the lower the absolute viral load, the better the clinical and virologic outcomes. 7, 8 Guidelines recommend quantifying plasma HIV-1 RNA immediately before initiating therapy and 2 to 8 weeks later, with the goal to achieve an undetectable viral load level within 16 to 24 weeks of initiating therapy. It is important to determine early in the treatment course if there is suboptimal viral load suppression, so that factors affecting adherence can be assessed and, if needed, the regimen altered. After the initial response has been characterized, the viral load should be monitored every 3 to 4 months to ensure the response to therapy is sustained.",

Viral load testing also aids in the diagnosis of acute HIV-1 infection (the window period after infection that occurs before detectable antibody production), although the currently available viral load assays are not FDA approved for diagnostic purposes. During this period of early infection, patients typically have very high viral loads ranging from 10 5 to 10 7 copies/mL. 10 HIV RNA testing is recommended in the 2014 updated HIV diagnostic testing algorithm for patients who are reactive in a fourth-generation immunoassay but test negative in a supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation test, primarily to better detect acute HIV-1 infections. 11 However, only one HIV RNA test is FDA approved for diagnosis, the APTIMA HIV-1 qualitative assay (Hologic, San Diego, CA), and it is not widely available in clinical laboratories. Hospital laboratories would benefit from an FDA diagnostic claim for viral load testing that is done reflexively in the above diagnostic algorithm because verifying this claim at a local laboratory level is overly burdensome.",

            "text": "Most clinical laboratories are using one of the real-time PCR assays because of their lower limits of detection and quantification and increased dynamic range compared with older-generation PCR assays and the branched DNA assay. Genotype bias was a significant problem in some of the earlier viral load assays because the gene targets chosen were not highly conserved among the different HIV-1 subtypes. However, this problem has been addressed, and the current versions of the Roche and Abbott real-time PCR assays both accurately quantify group M, group O, and CRFs of HIV-1. 13 The intra-assay imprecision of HIV-1 viral load assays is approximately 0.12 to 0.2 log 10 copies/mL. The biologic variation of viral load in patients not receiving therapy is approximately 0.3 log 10 copies/mL. 14 Consequently, changes in viral load must exceed 0.5 log 10 copies/mL (a threefold change) to suggest a meaningful change in viral replication. Viral load testing is routinely performed on plasma specimens, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is the anticoagulant of choice. Acidecitrateedextrose is also an acceptable anticoagulant, but blood anticoagulated in heparin is unacceptable for most tests. It is critical to handle clinical specimens properly to minimize the risk of RNA degradation during specimen collection and transport. Plasma should be separated within 6 hours of collection and ideally stored at \u00c020 C, although plasma viral RNA is stable at 4 C for several days. For laboratories testing specimens collected at remote sites, sample handling can require careful attention. Special blood collection containers, or tubes, are available that contain a gel that provides a physical barrier between the plasma and cells after centrifugation. The tubes can be shipped without the need to transfer the plasma into a separate tube. Tubes should not be frozen before pouring off of the plasma because this may lead to falsely elevated viral load assays. 15, 16 Six general classes of antiretroviral drugs are used in clinical care: NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs, fusion inhibitors, INSTIs, and CCR5 entry inhibitors. Viral resistance can occur with each of these drug classes, particularly when viral replication is not maximally suppressed during therapy. The current standard of care is to use regimens that contain a combination of drugs because resistance is less likely to occur on the complex regimens than on monotherapy.",

Interpretation of resistance mutations uses \"rules-based\" software that takes into account cross-resistance and interactions of mutations. The commercially available systems generate a summary report that lists the various mutations that have been identified in the RT and protease genes, and each drug is reported as resistant, possibly resistant, no evidence of resistance, or insufficient evidence. A comprehensive discussion of the specific mutations associated with each antiretroviral drug and the interactions of mutations is beyond the scope of this chapter but is available from a variety of sources (eg, http://www.iasusa.org, http://hivdb.stanford.edu/). A limitation of currently used genotypic and phenotypic assays is that they can detect only those mutants that make up at least 20% of the total viral population. Regimens chosen based on resistance testing may not always be effective because the minority populations will quickly predominate in the presence of drug. Drug selection pressure is also needed for some resistance mutations to persist at detectable concentrations in the viral population; when drug therapy is discontinued, the wild-type virus may quickly predominate. For this reason, it is recommended that specimens for resistance testing be obtained while the patient is on ART. The minimum viral load required for reliable resistance testing is approximately 1000 copies/mL. Because genotyping assays are especially sensitive to RNA degradation, care must be taken to properly handle the specimen after collection. (UTRs) . The genome structure is most similar to viruses of the family Flaviviridae, which includes many of the arthropod-borne viruses. As in other flaviviruses, the three N-terminal proteins of HCV (core, envelope 1 [E1]) and envelope 2 [E2]) are probably structural and the four C-terminal proteins (nonstructural 2, 3, 4, and 5) are thought to function in viral replication. HCV is classified within the family Flaviviridae in its own genus, Hepacivirus.",

In the United States, type 1 accounts for approximately 70% of the infections with equal distribution between subtypes 1a and 1b. Viral genotype does not correlate with disease progression. 21, 22 Detection of HCV RNA in serum or plasma by NA amplification methods is important for confirming the diagnosis of HCV, distinguishing active from resolved infection, assessing the virologic response to therapy, and screening the blood supply. These tests are incorporated into diagnostic algorithms for hepatitis C proposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 23 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, 24 and National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry. 25 The detection of HCV RNA in the plasma or serum is the earliest marker of infection, appearing 1 to 2 weeks after infection and weeks before elevation of liver enzymes or the appearance of anti-HCV antibodies. Approximately 80% of individuals infected with HCV will be chronically infected with the virus. In antibody-positive individuals, HCV RNA tests can distinguish active from resolved infections. In patients with a high pretest probability of infection, a positive serologic screening test result is usually confirmed with a test for HCV RNA rather than the recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA). This strategy is cost-effective and more informative than using the RIBA to confirm positive antibody screening tests in a diagnostic setting. 26 However, with the discontinuation of the HCV RIBA by the manufacturer in 2012, all reactive HCV antibody screening tests should be followed by FDA-approved HCV RNA testing. 27 Hepatitis C virus RNA testing also is helpful for the diagnosis of infection in infants born to HCV-infected mothers because of the persistence of maternal antibody and in immunocompromised or debilitated patients who may have blunted serologic responses. An HCV RNA test also should be used for patients suspected of having an acute infection and in patients with hepatitis of no identifiable cause.",

Triple therapy for genotype 1 infections has led to approximately a 30% increase in SVR over the previous standard of care therapy in all patient subgroups. TVR also has activity against genotype 2 infections but not against genotype 3 infections. BOC appears to have activity against both genotypes 2 and 3 infections. However, neither drug should be used to treat patients with genotype 2 and 3 infections because SVR rates with pegylated IFN-a and ribavirin alone are much higher. 42 The important time points for response-guided therapy are at 8, 12, and 24 weeks for BOC and 4, 12, and 24 weeks for TVR. Treatment with all three drugs should be stopped if HCV RNA is greater than 100 IU/mL at week 12 or detectable at week 24 for BOC triple therapy and if HCV RNA is greater than 1000 IU/mL at weeks 4 or 12 or detectable at week 24 with TVR.",

Two of these assays use real-time PCR, cobas AmpliPrep/cobas TaqMan, version 2.0 (Roche Diagnostics), and m2000 RealTime System (Abbott Molecular); the third uses branched DNA signal amplification, Versant 3.0 (Siemens). The amplification method, gene targets, and dynamic ranges for these assays are given in Table 5 .1. The commercially available assays are calibrated against a World Health Organization (WHO) international calibration standard and report results in IU/mL. The first version of the cobas TaqMan HCV test had a genotype bias particularly against genotype 4 samples. The second version of the assay has been modified to enhance its ability to accurately quantify all of the major HCV genotypes. 45, 46 The development of the WHO first international HCV RNA standard and its acceptance by the manufacturers of HCV RNA assays as a calibrator was a significant advance in HCV RNA quantification. 47 However, despite the implementation of an international standard, HCV RNA measurements are not equivalent between the different assays. 48, 49 Therefore, patients should ideally be tested with the same assay during the course of their treatment to minimize the potential for patient management errors. 50 Although a number of baseline factors are predictive of response to treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection, HCV genotype is a strong and consistent predictor for achieving a SVR to pegylated IFN-a and ribavirin. In the large clinical trials of combination therapy with pegylated IFN-a and ribavirin, only 30% of patients infected with genotype 1 had a SVR compared with 65% of patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3. 37, 38 The determination of HCV subtypes has no clinical relevance in patients treated with IFN-a and ribavirin, but different treatment durations based on viral load kinetics are recommended for patients with different HCV genotypes. However, the emergence of resistant variants and virologic breakthrough were more common in patients infected with HCV subtype 1a than 1b when treated with TVR triple therapy. 51 HCV subtyping may play a role in helping to select treatment regimens and predict the development of resistance to DAA drugs. In addition, triple therapy with a protease inhibitor is not recommended for patients infected with genotypes 2 and 3.",

Also antiviral-resistant variants are found in about 5% of patients before treatment but do not appear to impact response to either protease inhibitor. Currently, there is no role for antiviral resistance genotyping at baseline or during treatment with the protease inhibitors. 52 Several mutations in the NS3/4A protease are associated with reduced susceptibility to simeprevir. One of the most common and clinically relevant mutations is the substitution Q80K. This mutation may be present at baseline in approximately 30% of patients with genotype 1a and is associated with lower SVR rates. For patients with genotype 1a, Q80K mutation testing is recommended and patients with this variant should be offered other treatment options. 53 A variety of laboratory-developed and commercial assays are used for HCV genotyping. The methods include NA sequencing, reverse hybridization, subtype-specific PCR, DNA fragment length polymorphism, heteroduplex mobility analysis, melting curve analysis, and serologic genotyping. Currently, there is only one FDA-approved HCV genotyping assay, the Abbott RealTime HCV Genotype II assay. 54 It uses real-time PCR and multiple hydrolysis probes to amplify and differentiate genotypes 1 to 6 and subtype 1a and 1b. The 5 0 UTR is the target to identify the genotype and the NS5B is the target for subtyping genotype 1 samples.

This reverse hybridization assay was developed by Innogenetics (Fujirebio Europe) and is now marketed as the Versant HCV Genotype 2.0 Assay by Siemens. In this line probe assay (LiPA), biotinylated PCR products from the 5 0 UTR and core regions of the HCV genome are hybridized under stringent conditions with oligonucleotide probes attached to a nitrocellulose strip: 19 type-and subtypespecific probes interrogate the 5 0 UTR and an additional three probes interrogate the core region. The core region probes were added to provide better discrimination of subtypes 1a and 1b and genotype 6. 55 Hybridized PCR products are detected with a streptavidinealkaline phosphatase conjugate. The pattern of reactive lines defines the genotype and in some cases the subtype. The assay discriminates among genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a/c, 2b, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3k, 4a/c/d, 4b, 4e, 4h, 5a, and 6a/b. The Versant HCV Genotype 2.0 Assay correctly identifies genotypes and distinguishes subtypes 1a and 1b when compared with sequencing but may not be able to adequately identify the other subtypes. 56 Mixed genotype infections can be recognized as unusual patterns of hybridization signals. However, the LiPA requires a considerable amount of amplicon for typing, and the assay may regularly fail when the viral load is less than 10 4 copies/mL. Sequence analysis of amplified subgenomic sequences is the most definitive way to genotype HCV strains. Genotyping schemes based on sequencing variable genes such as E1, Core, and NS5B provide enough resolution to determine types and subtypes. 57, 58 The 5 0 UTR is too highly conserved to discriminate all subtypes reliably. Genotyping methods targeting highly variable regions have higher failure rates because of primer mismatches and failed amplification reactions. Sequencing reactions can be performed directly on PCR products or on cloned amplicons. Mixed infections with multiple genotypes may be missed by sequence analysis. Definitive detection of mixed infections requires analysis of a large number of clones. Cloning may, however, emphasize artifactual nucleotide substitutions introduced by the DNA polymerase during amplification or by selection during the cloning procedure and is generally not practical for clinical laboratories.",

            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small enveloped DNA virus belonging to the family Hepadnaviridae and causes transient or persistent (chronic) infection of the liver. This family is divided into two genera, orthohepadnavirus and avihepadnavirus, which infect mammals or birds as natural hosts, respectively. 67 They possess a narrow host range determined by the initial steps of viral attachment and entry. Approximately 2 billion people have serologic evidence of hepatitis B, and of these, approximately 350 million people have chronic infections. 68 Depending on viral and host factors, the outcomes of infection with HBV range from clearance to mild or severe chronic hepatitis (CHB) to the development of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 69, 70 The evolution of increasingly sensitive methods for HBV DNA detection and its accurate quantification has created an important role for molecular testing in routine patient care. Improved methods for sequencing and single mutation detection have led to tests that document mutational change in the viral genome. Currently, NA testing plays a critical role in the overall care of HBV-infected patients. The HBV genome is a 3.2-kilobase relaxed circular, partially double-stranded DNA molecule. It has four partially overlapping open reading frames encoding the viral envelope (pre-S and S), nucleocapsid (precore and core), polymerase, and X proteins. After binding to hepatocytes, the virion is taken up into the cell by endocytosis and uncoated. The partially double-stranded DNA genome is converted to a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the cell nucleus. The cccDNA is used as a template for transcription of the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and messenger RNA in the cell nucleus. The pgRNA moves into the host cell cytoplasm and serves as the template for translation of the HBV RT as well as the core protein by the cellular translational proteins. Concurrently, the HBV RT reverse transcribes the pgRNA to a new circular DNA molecule. Early in the replication cycle, some of the newly synthesized genomes will circulate back to the nucleus to maintain and increase the pool of cccDNA. 71 Although HBV is a DNA virus, it replicates by an RT that lacks proofreading activity and, as a result, is prone to errors. The overlapping open reading frames of the genome limit the types of mutations that can be tolerated. However, variations in HBV sequences have been detected in almost all regions of the genome. Consequently, HBV exists as quasispecies, and different patients may be infected with different strains and genotypes.",

Molecular assays to quantify blood HBV DNA are useful for the initial evaluation of HBV infections, monitoring of patients with chronic infections, and assessing the efficacy of antiviral treatment. 71, 73 In addition, U.S. blood donors are routinely screened for HBV DNA by qualitative tests to detect donors in the early stage of infection. 74 Antiviral resistance mutations are detected by molecular methods that identify known mutations associated with drug resistance.",

Monitoring disease activity in chronically HBV-infected patients is best done by measuring aminotransferase (ALT) at regular intervals in HBeAg-positive patients. However, serial HBV DNA testing is recommended in HBeAg-negative patients. The determination of serum HBV DNA (viral load) is important in the pretreatment evaluation and monitoring of therapeutic response in patients with chronic infection. 73 Currently, therapy for chronic HBV infection does not eradicate the virus and has limited long-term efficacy. The decision to treat should be based on ALT elevations; the presence of HBeAg or HBV DNA (or both); viral load of greater than 2000 IU/mL; the presence of moderate disease activity and fibrosis on liver biopsy; and virologic testing to exclude concurrent infections with hepatitis D virus (HDV), HCV, and HIV. The treatment goals for chronic hepatitis B are to achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and to prevent further progression of liver disease. Parameters used to indicate treatment response include normalization of serum ALT, decrease in serum HBV DNA, and loss of HBeAg with or without detection of anti-HBeAg. Currently, there are eight FDA-approved therapies for chronic HBV infection: IFN-a, pegylated IFN-a2a, four nucleoside analogs (lamivudine, telbivudine, entecavir, and emtricitabine), and two nucleotide analogs (adefovir and tenofovir). Several factors predict a favorable response to IFN treatment with the most important being high ALT and low serum HBV DNA viral load, which are indirect markers of immune clearance.",

Endpoints of treatment have traditionally been clearance of HBeAg, development of anti-HBe antibodies, and undetectable serum HBV DNA using insensitive hybridization assays with detection limits of approximately 10 6 genome copies/mL. Achieving these endpoints usually is accompanied by resolution of liver disease as evidenced by normalization of ALT and decreased inflammation on liver biopsy. The response usually is sustained at long-term follow-up. Nevertheless, most responders continue to have detectable HBV DNA when sensitive NA amplification tests are used. Responses to antiviral therapy are categorized as biochemical, virologic, or histologic and as on therapy or sustained off therapy. 73 Several variations in the nucleotide sequence of HBV have important clinical consequences. An important mutation in the gene encoding HBsAg is a glycine-to-arginine substitution at codon 145 (G145R) in the conserved \"a\" determinant, which causes decreased affinity of the HBsAg for anti-HBs antibodies. 75 HBV with this mutation has been found in children of HBsAg-positive mothers who develop HBV infection despite vaccination and an adequate anti-HBs antibody response after vaccination, as well as in liver transplant recipients who have recurrent infection despite administration of HBV immune globulin. 76, 77 These immune escape mutants have raised concern about vaccine efficacy and serologically silent infections. The G145R mutation has been reported in many countries and is responsible for 2% to 40% of vaccine failures. Although there is diminished binding to anti-HBs antibodies, the vast majority of S mutants can be readily detected with the current generation of HBsAg tests. Thus, an initial concern that widespread use of HBV immune globulin and vaccination would result in HBV mutants that would escape detection in the HBsAg test was unfounded.",

In transplant recipients, the occurrence and severity of CMV disease are related to the CMV serostatus of the organ donor and recipient, the type of organ transplanted, and the overall degree of immunosuppression. For example, CMV disease tends to be more severe in lung transplant recipients than in renal transplant recipients. For all types of solid organ recipients, the most severe disease occurs when CMVseronegative recipients receive an organ from a CMVseropositive donor and the primary CMV infection occurs while the person is immunosuppressed. In contrast, CMVseropositive recipients of hematopoietic stem cells from CMV-seronegative donors are at highest risk of CMV diseases after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). CMV disease can also occur in seropositive individuals, whether they receive an organ from a seropositive or seronegative donor.

Therapy is administered before development of symptoms in an attempt to prevent the onset of active disease.

Therefore, the threshold or viral load cutoff at which a diagnosis is made or preemptive therapy is begun has varied among institutions and transplant populations.

Viral load values decrease rapidly after appropriate antiviral therapy is begun, and CMV DNA is cleared from the plasma within several weeks of initiation of therapy. [92] [93] [94] Failure of viral loads to decrease promptly should raise concerns of possible treatment failure because persistently elevated concentrations of CMV DNA during therapy indicates therapeutic resistance. Molecular assays can also identify patients at risk for relapsing CMV infection. In solid organ transplant recipients, patients with a detectable viral load after completing 14 days of ganciclovir therapy for CMV infection are at increased risk of relapse. The rate of decline in CMV DNA after initiation of therapy can be also used to predict risk of relapse of CMV infection. 94 Cytomegalovirus DNA concentrations are also useful in assessing the risk of developing CMV disease in persons with AIDS. Detection of CMV DNA in plasma is associated with increased risk of developing CMV disease and increased risk of death. In addition, each log 10 increase in viral load (ie, each 10-fold increase in concentration) has been associated with a threefold increase in the risk of developing CMV disease. 95 Currently, there are only two FDA-approved CMV viral load assays (see Table 5 .1): CAP/CTM CMV test (Roche) and artus CMV RGQ MDx (Qiagen). Both are based on real-time PCR, are calibrated against the WHO CMV standard, and consequently report results in international units per milliliter. The Roche test amplifies a portion of UL54 gene and the Qiagen test amplifies a portion of the MIE gene. Both assays have similar lower limits of quantification, but the Qiagen assay has a 10-fold greater dynamic range. Despite the availability of an international standard and of FDA-approved assays, there is still considerable interlaboratory variability of results in CMV proficiency testing surveys. 96 Epstein-Barr Virus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the Herpesviridae family. The seroprevalence of EBV is greater than 95% among adults older than the age of 40 years, and primary infection is followed by lifelong latency with reactivation of infection in immunocompromised hosts. In transplant recipients, EBV infection may cause malaise, fever, headache, and sore throat, but it is also associated with posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. PTLD is a spectrum of lymphocytic proliferation that ranges from benign lymphocytic hyperplasia to potentially fatal malignant lymphoma. The process is often multicentric and may involve the central nervous system (CNS), eyes, gastrointestinal (GI) tract (with bleeding and perforation), liver, spleen, lymph nodes, lungs, allograft, oropharynx, and other organs. Clinical presentations vary and include, but are not limited to, adenopathy, fever (including \"fever of unknown origin\"), abdominal pain, anorexia, jaundice, bowel perforation, GI bleeding, renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, pneumothorax, pulmonary infiltrates or nodules, and weight loss.",

            "text": "BK virus (BKV) is a member of family Polyomaviridae, which also includes JC virus (JCV) and simian virus 40 (SV40). It is an enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that shares approximately 70% sequence homology with JCV and SV40. Seroprevalence reaches nearly 100% in early childhood, generally after an asymptomatic primary infection (although fever and nonspecific upper respiratory tract symptoms may occur). 109 Seroprevalence declines to 60% to 80% in adulthood. After primary infection, the virus can remain latent in many sites, most notably the epithelium of the urinary tract and lymphoid cells, until an immunosuppressed state allows reactivation and replication of the virus. Replication of BKV in immunocompromised hosts may be asymptomatic or cause organ dysfunction, affecting the kidney, bladder, or ureter. BKV disease in the urinary system manifests as hemorrhagic or nonhemorrhagic cystitis and with ureteric stenosis in bone marrow and solid organ transplant recipients. 110 It also causes polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PVAN) in renal transplant recipients. 111 Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a cause of morbidity and occasional mortality in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. 112 The manifestations range from microscopic hematuria to severe bladder hemorrhage leading to clot retention and renal failure. Its incidence varies from 7% to 68% of bone marrow transplant recipients. Although mild HC usually resolves with supportive care, severe HC may require bladder irrigation, cystoscopy, and cauterization. 113 BKV was observed in early studies to be associated with the development of HC during bone marrow transplantation; however, later studies using sensitive PCR assays showed that BKV DNA could be detected in the blood and urine of patients with or without HC. [114] [115] [116] Recently, quantitative assays for BKV DNA in urine have demonstrated that patients with HC have higher peak BK viruria and larger total amounts of BKV excreted during bone marrow transplantation compared with asymptomatic patients. 117, 118 Although BKV was first isolated from the urine of a renal transplant recipient in 1971, 119 the association between nephropathy and the presence of BKV in renal transplant recipients was not reported until 1995. 120 BKV replication in renal allografts can lead to progressive graft dysfunction and, potentially, graft failure. Although the recognition of PVAN in renal transplant recipients coincided with the use of newer immunosuppressive drugs such as tacrolimus, sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil, risk factors for development of PVAN have not been elucidated. 121 The prevalence of PVAN ranges from 1% to 10% in kidney transplant recipients with loss of allograft function in about one third to half of these cases. 121 The disease appears to result from reactivation of BKV infection in the donor allograft.",

However, these changes are not pathognomonic for PVAN, and most centers use immunohistochemical staining with antibodies specific for polyomavirus proteins or in situ hybridization to confirm the diagnosis. 121 Because of the focal nature of the nephropathy and the possibility of sampling error, a negative biopsy does not rule out PVAN. Biopsy of the kidney is an invasive procedure that is impractical for serial monitoring, early diagnosis, and clinical management of patients with PVAN. Other less invasive diagnostic methods for PVAN have also been assessed. Urine cytology may reveal renal epithelial cells with intranuclear viral inclusion bodies, termed decoy cells. 123 The sensitivity and specificity of decoy cells for diagnosing PVAN is 99% and 95%, respectively, but the positive predictive value varies between 27% and 90%. Quantification of BKV DNA or mRNA in urine by NA amplification methods has been proposed as a method to monitor changes in BKV replication. [124] [125] [126] [127] However, physiological changes of urine constituents and use of different urine fractions may give rise to considerable variation in viral load values that may complicate the identification of diagnostic thresholds and quantitative cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. 111 PCR methods for detection and quantitation of BK viremia have emerged as clinically useful tools in the diagnosis and management of PVAN because viremia precedes development of nephropathy in almost all cases. [128] [129] [130] [131] In 2005, an expert interdisciplinary panel recommended the use of either urine cytology or NA amplification tests to screen renal transplant recipients for BK viruria every 3 months up to 2 years posttransplant or when allograft dysfunction occurs or biopsy is performed. 121 Patients with positive screening test results should have an adjunct quantitative NA amplification test performed using urine or plasma. Patients with urine DNA loads of more than 10 7 copies/mL or plasma DNA loads of more than 10 4 copies/mL that persist for more than 3 weeks have presumptive PVAN and a renal biopsy should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.",

The stability of NA avoids the necessity of immediate transport to the laboratory, and specimens may be stored refrigerated or at room temperature before transport. Transport and storage requirements vary among tests, so it is important to refer to the package insert for specific details. An additional advantage of NA testing is the use of urine specimens, which for women allows testing to be done without the need for a pelvic examination.

Not all assays are cleared by the FDA for use in the United States for all conditions and age ranges, and the current assays are not FDAcleared for oropharyngeal, rectal, or conjunctival specimens. However, many of these tests have been assessed for diagnosing infections in multiple extragenital anatomic sites in men, women, and children. Current CDC guidelines for laboratory-based detection of CT and NG recommend NAATs for oropharyngeal and rectal specimens and for use in evaluating cases of adult and pediatric sexual abuse. 141 However, use of these tests outside of the FDA-approved indications requires that laboratories establish the specifications for performance characteristics according to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations. Performance characteristics vary among assays (details are available in the package inserts), but some general comments can be made. The diagnostic sensitivity of the tests varies according to the specimen type and whether the patient is asymptomatic or symptomatic. Interpretation of the results of NA testing for CT can be challenging because many studies have shown these assays to be more diagnostically sensitive than culture, which was previously used as the gold standard for clinical trials. For men, the diagnostic sensitivity of testing urine specimens is nearly equivalent to that of testing urethral swabs. A limited volume (20e50 mL) of first-passed urine is preferred because larger volumes will lead to a decreased concentration of the organism in the sample and thus reduced diagnostic sensitivity. With proper specimen collection, male urethral swabs and urine specimens have a sensitivity of nearly 100% for the detection of NG or CT infection. For women, vaginal and cervical swab specimens provide the highest sensitivity for the detection of NG and CT infection, with many studies showing a sensitivity of 90% to 95%. Vaginal swabs are preferred because they are easier to collect. Urine specimens can be used, but they generally result in a lower diagnostic sensitivity than cervical swabs (75% e85%). An alternative to urine testing in women is the use of self-collected vaginal swabs, which have been shown in some studies to have a diagnostic sensitivity that is equal to that obtained with cervical swabs; several commercial tests have been cleared for use with vaginal swabs.",

Considerations for selection of diagnostic methods should include testing location, analysis time, performance characteristics, and the cost to perform the test. Clinical diagnosis of HSV is insensitive and nonspecific; therefore, the clinical diagnosis of genital herpes should be confirmed by laboratory testing. Many infected persons do not experience the multiple vesicular or ulcerative lesions typical of genital herpes. Both virologic and type-specific serologic tests are used to confirm the diagnosis. 154 Cell culture and NAATs are the preferred virologic tests for persons who seek diagnosis and treatment of genital ulcers or other mucocutaneous lesions. The sensitivity of viral culture is low, especially for recurrent lesions, and declines rapidly as lesions begin to heal. NAATs for HSV DNA are increasingly used in many laboratories, and several tests are now cleared by the FDA for anogenital specimens. 155, 156 NAATs are the preferred tests for detecting HSV in spinal fluid for diagnosis of HSV infection of the CNS and are discussed later in this chapter. Both culture and NAATs should determine whether the infection is due to HSV-1 or HSV-2 because recurrences and asymptomatic shedding are much less frequent for HSV-1 than for HSV-2 genital infections. 157 Failure to detect HSV by culture or NAAT does not rule out HSV infection because viral shedding is intermittent. The use of Tzanck preparations or Pap tests to detect cytologic changes produced by HSV are insensitive and nonspecific and should not be used for genital HSV infections.",

HPV is not a single virus but a family of more than 150 related viral genotypes that are distinguished based on sequence analysis of the L1 region of the viral genome. Anogenital HPV infections are common in both men and women. It is estimated that more than 24 million men and women in the United States are currently infected with HPV. HPV is an STI; it is most common among sexually active young women ages 15 through 25 years. In one study, cervicovaginal HPV was found in up to 43% of sexually active college women during a 3-year period. 159 Infections, however, are usually transient, and progression to cancer requires persistence of viral infection over several years. The types of HPV that are spread through sexual contact are classified as low or high risk for progression to malignancy, and there are multiple types. Infections with low-risk HPV such as types 6 and 11 can lead to benign genital warts or condyloma acuminata and have a low likelihood of progressing to malignancy. In contrast, high-risk types such as types 16, 18, and 45 are associated with development of SCC of the anogenital region and oropharynx. Currently, there are 14 high-risk (HR) HPV types recognized. The cervix is particularly affected, and worldwide, cervical SCC continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality (5% of cancer deaths).",

            "text": "Screening for cervical cancer with cytology testing has been very effective in reducing cervical cancer in the United States. For many years, the approach was an annual Pap test. In 2000 the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) test (Qiagen/ Digene) for detection of HR HPV types was approved by the FDA for screening women who had ASCUS detected by the Pap test to determine the need for colposcopy. At the time, the Hybrid Capture 2 test was the only FDA-approved test available. In 2003, the FDA approved expanding the use of this test to include screening preformed in conjunction with a Pap test for women over the age of 30 years, referred to as \"co-testing.\" Co-testing allows women to extend the testing interval to 5 years if both test results are negative. 160 In 2014, the FDA approved the use of an HR HPV test (cobas HPV test, Roche) for primary cervical cancer screening for women older than the age of 25 years, without the need for a concomitant Pap test. When using the HR HPV test as the primary screening test, a Pap test is performed only when specific HR HPV types are detected (HPV-16 and -18 are excluded). Colposcopy is performed without an intervening Pap test in women who test positive for HPV-16 and -18. This algorithm was based primarily on the results of a single large FDA registration study for the cobas HPV test. 161 Interim clinical guidance is available for the use of primary HR HPV testing in cervical cancer screening. 162 However, there is still considerable debate about whether co-testing or HR HPV as a primary screening test is the optimal approach for cervical cancer screening. 163 Four tests for the detection of HR HPV types have been cleared by the FDA for use in the United States: HC2 test, Cervista HPV HR (Hologic/Gen-Probe), cobas HPV test (Roche), and Aptima HPV test (Hologic/Gen-Probe). In addition, two different FDA-cleared tests to specifically identify HPV types 16 and 18 (Cervista) and types 16 and 18/45 (Aptima) are available. The features of these tests are compared in Table 5 .4. All of these tests have been cleared by the FDA for use with ThinPrep PreservCyt liquid-based cytology medium (Hologic) but not with the other commonly used SurePath medium (Becton-Dickinson).",

The MTD test is based on transcriptionmediated amplification of ribosomal RNA and can be used to test both AFB smear-positive and smear-negative respiratory specimens. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay uses real-time PCR to detect the DNA of M. tuberculosis and the mutations in the rpoB gene associated with rifampin resistance in sputum specimens. Rifampin resistance most often coexists with isoniazid resistance so detection of rifampin resistance serves as a marker for potentially multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains. Similar to the other assays developed by Cepheid, the Xpert MTB/RIF assay uses a disposable cartridge that automates the NA extraction, target amplification, and amplicon detection in conjunction with the GeneXpert Instrument System. Sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for detection of M. tuberculosis appear to be comparable to other FDA-approved NAATs for this use. Sensitivity of detection of rifampin resistance was 95% and specificity 99% in a multicenter study using archived and prospective specimens from subjects suspected of having tuberculosis. 191 Because the prevalence of rifampin resistance is low in the United States, a positive result indicating a mutation in the rpoB gene should be confirmed by rapid DNA sequencing for prompt reassessment of the treatment regimen and followed by growth-based drug susceptibility testing. 190 The CDC offers these services free of charge.",

Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by B. pertussis. Despite widespread childhood vaccination, more than 28,660 cases were reported in the United States in 2014. (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/downloads/pertuss-surv-report-2014.pdf). The reported cases represent only the \"tip of the iceberg\" with an estimated 800,000 to 3.3 million cases occurring in the United States annually. Although pertussis occurs most often in children younger than 1 year of age, the incidence in older children has increased substantially in recent years. Adolescents and adults, in whom immunity wanes several years after prior infection or vaccination, transmit the organism to susceptible infants. Pertussis in older children and adults is usually characterized by prolonged cough without the inspiratory whoop or posttussive vomiting that typically is observed in infants.",

Cases usually have exposure to farm animals or pets, which serve as the natural hosts for B. bronchiseptica. 193 B. holmesii is the most recently recognized species to be associated with pertussis-like illness in humans. 194 All four species play a significant role in human respiratory disease, and they should be considered in the design of NAATs for patients with pertussis-like disease. 195 The laboratory diagnosis of pertussis has been fundamentally transformed in the past 2 decades. Culture and DFA staining of nasopharyngeal secretions are now largely replaced by NAATs in clinical laboratories. Although culture is specific for diagnosis, it is relatively insensitive. The fastidious nature and slow growth of the B. pertussis make it difficult to isolate. Although DFA staining can provide rapid results, it is neither sensitive nor specific. Serologic testing can be useful late in the disease when the organism may not be detectable by culture or NAAT and in the investigation of outbreaks, but the tests are not standardized, so the results may be difficult to interpret.",

However, blood cultures require 1 to 5 days of incubation before they are positive, and this timeline is inconsistent with the need to obtain rapid answers to inform treatment decisions in patients with sepsis. Direct detection of pathogens in blood without the need for culture would be ideal but presents a number of challenges. Specimen preparation, enrichment for pathogen DNA, and integration of the front-end specimen preparation with a back-end molecular analysis that identifies virtually all pathogens are major obstacles to success. Also, highly sensitive molecular methods for direct detection of microbial DNA in blood present significant challenges for validation given the known limitations of the sensitivity of culture, the current gold standard. The Roche SeptiFast system has been available longer than any other method for direct detection of microorganisms in the blood. 207 It uses real-time PCR performed on a LightCycler instrument that targets the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region. The target DNA is amplified in three parallel, multiplex, real-time PCR assays for detection of 10 gram-positive, 10 gram-negative, and 5 fungal pathogens. Melting curve analysis is used to reliably differentiate the pathogens. The assay is technically complex, requires large amounts of hands-on time, and has an analysis time of about 6 hours. Several evaluations have reported lower sensitivities and specificities in clinical settings when compared with blood cultures. [208] [209] [210] [211] Another molecular approach to direct detection of pathogens in blood and other body fluids has been developed by Ibis Biosciences, a subsidiary of Abbott Molecular. This method combines broad-range PCR with electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). The technology has been described in great detail elsewhere, 212 but briefly, it works by coupling conserved-site PCR reactions that are able to amplify shared genes from diverse microorganisms to ESI-MS. Measurement of amplicon mass provides species-specific signatures that can be matched to known signatures in a database. After PCR amplification, ESI-MS analysis is performed on the amplicon mixtures, and the A, G, C, and T base compositions are compared with a database of known base compositions derived from existing sequence data. This technology accurately identifies diverse microbes from blood, other body fluids, and tissues in research settings. 213 The PCR/ESI-MS system was evaluated for the direct detection of bacteria and Candida spp. in the blood of 331 patients with suspected bloodstream infections and was found 83% sensitive and 94% specific compared with culture. 214 Replicate testing of the discrepant samples by PCR/ESI-MS resulted in increased sensitivity (91%) and specificity (99%) when confirmed infections were considered true positives. Ibis/Abbott has developed an automated and integrated platform for PCR/ES-MS analysis of clinical samples called IRID-ICA. A bloodstream infection assay for this new platform that identifies up to 500 different organisms and four antibiotic resistance genes is currently in clinical trials. Another novel technology that shows promise for direct detection of pathogens in blood is T2 magnetic resonance (T2MR)ebased biosensing. 215 T2 Biosystems has developed an assay to directly identify Candida spp. in the blood of patients with suspected candidemia. In this assay, the Candida cells are lysed, their DNA is amplified by PCR, and the amplified product is detected directly in the whole-blood matrix by amplicon-induced agglomeration of superparamagnetic nanoparticles. Nanoparticle clustering yields changes in the T2 (spin-spin) relaxation time, making it detectable by magnetic resonance. A small portable T2MR instrument for rapid and precise T2 relaxation measurements has been designed for standard PCR tubes. The T2Dx instrument automates all of the steps in the assay with approximately 5 minutes of hands on time, and results are available within 3 to 5 hours. The T2 Candida panel is FDA approved, and the clinical trial data showed an overall sensitivity and specificity of 91.1% and 99.4%, respectively. 216 T2 Biosystems has a panel in development for direct detection of bacteria in blood.",

These toxins are responsible for symptomatic disease; strains that lack these toxin genes do not cause diarrhea or colitis. Toxin B may be more important for production of disease than toxin A. 232 Detection of these toxins or of their activity is essential in diagnostic tests for C. difficileeassociated disease. An additional toxin, the binary toxin, has been described in some strains of C. difficile, and recent reports have suggested that strains encoding the binary toxin (CDT) have a deletion in the tcdC gene, leading to overexpression of toxins A and B (ribotype 027), and are causing outbreaks of more severe disease. 233 C. difficile is a frequent cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis both in the hospital and community. In hospitals, the risk of infection increases with the length of hospital stay, and use of antimicrobial therapy greatly increases the likelihood of acquiring C. difficile colitis. C. difficile causes a spectrum of disease ranging from asymptomatic carrier state to fulminant, relapsing, and fatal colitis. Diarrhea may be mild to severe. Pseudomembranous colitis is a classic presentation of C. difficile disease, and toxic megacolon may also be seen. Although clindamycin, penicillins, and cephalosporins have commonly been associated with disease, almost all antibiotics can cause similar disease.",

            "text": "Various non-NA tests are available for the diagnosis of C. difficile infection. Culture of the organism alone is not helpful in the diagnosis because there needs to be confirmation that the organism produces toxins. The cell culture cytotoxicity test neutralization assay (CCNA), which detects the cytopathic effect of toxin B, is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of clinically important C. difficile infection. The test is highly sensitive and specific but is labor intensive and technically demanding. The TAT of 1 to 3 days limits its clinical utility. 234 The most commonly used tests are EIAs and lateral flow devices that detect toxin A, toxin B, or both. Overall these tests have lower sensitivities (45%e95%) and specificities (75%e100%) than the cytotoxicity test. In general, EIAs that detect both toxins A and B are preferred because some strains may not produce toxin A. An alternative testing approach is detection of the common antigen glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). The test does not distinguish between toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains and cannot be used alone for the diagnosis of C. difficile disease. A positive result needs to be confirmed with the cytotoxicity test, a toxin EIA, or a NAAT for the detection of toxin B gene. The GDH test is a useful screening test because it has a high negative predictive value. One study evaluated a two-step approach using the GDH test as the initial screen followed by a CCNA for antigen-positive specimens to confirm the presence of toxin. A negative antigen test result was more than 99% predictive of a negative CCNA. 235 A limitation of this approach is the delay in obtaining a result because of the long TAT of the CCNA test. More recently, multistep algorithms using GDH, toxin EIA, and NAATs have been deployed in clinical laboratories. 236 In view of the limitations of traditional methods, molecular tests are a good alternative for the diagnosis of C. difficile infection. The first NAAT for detection of C. difficile in stool was approved in 2009. At the time of this writing, 15 different platforms are FDA approved and available for testing using a variety of methods, including real-time PCR, loop-mediated amplification, helicase-dependent amplification, and microarray technology. Some platforms are designed for lowvolume laboratories and on-demand testing, and others are more amenable to high-volume, batch mode testing. These assays detect a variety of gene targets, including tcdA, tcdB, cdt, and D117 deletion in tcdC, the latter two as surrogates for identification of the ribotype 027 strain.",

            "text": "The detection of antibiotic resistance is one of the most important functions of the clinical microbiology laboratory. This has traditionally been done by phenotypic methods. However, the delays inherent in phenotypic tests can lead to delays in appropriate therapy and adverse clinical outcomes. Molecular methods offer faster alternatives for detection of antibiotic resistance, but the genotypic approach has its own set of challenges because of the complexity of antibiotic resistance. In addition, the detection of a resistance gene may not necessarily imply phenotypic resistance if the gene is expressed at low levels or is not functional. Advances in technology and our understanding of the genetics of antibiotic resistance will likely make the use of molecular detection for antibiotic resistance more widespread in the future. This section focuses on the commonly used resistance targets, currently MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and b-lactamases in gram-negative bacteria. Because S. aureus is among the most common cause of bacterial infections in the industrialized world, particular attention has been focused on assays to rapidly differentiate MRSA from MSSA for diagnosis of infection and surveillance for infection control purposes. Molecular assays that recognize MRSA based on detection of a single target detect the junction between the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec element (SCCmec), which carries the mecA resistance and other genes, and the flanking orfX gene. 245 This assay design has several limitations, including false-negative results caused by SCCmec variants and false-positive results caused by MSSA strains that carry SCCmec remnants lacking the mecA gene, sometimes referred to as \"empty cassettes,\" or that carry SCCmec with a nonfunctional mecA gene. [245] [246] [247] An alternative approach to molecular detection of MRSA combines a mecA target and a second gene target specific for S. aureus such as sa442, nuc, femA-femB, spa, or Idh1. 248 At the time of this writing, there were five companies with FDA-approved assays for molecular detection of MRSA or MRSA and MSSA (BD Diagnostics, Cepheid, Elitech, Roche, and bioM\u00e9rieux). In addition to these stand-alone assays, molecular detection of MRSA is incorporated into the blood culture identification panels discussed previously. These assays are intended for use in surveillance testing or to assist in the diagnosis of infections. Depending on the platform, the tests can be run on demand or in batches. Studies indicate that use of molecular methods for rapid identification of patients who are colonized with MRSA may be a cost-effective infection control strategy. 249, 250 Enterococci are commensal residents of the GI tract and female genital tract that account for about 10% of hospitalacquired infections. The vast majority of enterococcal infections are caused by Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium and occur primarily in patients requiring long-term care. The emergence of VRE in hospitals is concerning because vancomycin is often used empirically to treat a wide variety of infections. Infection with VRE is associated with increased morbidity and mortality because of the propensity of VRE to infect patients already at high risk for comorbidity. 251 In the United States, about 30% of enterococci are resistant to vancomycin. High-level vancomycin resistance in enterococci occurs via acquisition of mobile transposable elements carrying the vanA or vanB genes. E. faecium is more frequently resistant to vancomycin than E. faecalis, and vanA is more commonly found than vanB in resistant strains. As with MRSA, the rapid detection of VRE colonization to prevent health careeassociated infections is widely recommended. 252 Molecular assays work well for this application. 253, 254 Three FDA-approved molecular assays are marketed for rapid detection of VRE from perianal and rectal swabs. The BD Gen-eOhm and IMDx assays detect both vanA and vanB, and the Cepheid assay detects vanA alone. All are based on real-time PCR, but only the Cepheid assay is designed for on-demand testing. Aside from rare reports of vanA in S. aureus and Streptococcus spp., detection of vanA is highly specific for VRE. However, vanB can be found in a wide variety of commensal nonenterococcal bacteria, so detection of vanB requires confirmation of VRE by culture. As with mecA, assays for detection of vanA and vanB have also been incorporated in the commercially available blood culture identification panels.",

Interest in elucidating the role of resident organisms in human health and disease has flourished over the past decade with the advent of new technologies for interrogating complex microbial communities. The microbiome is the totality of microbes, their genetic information, and the milieu in which they interact. 263 It includes bacteria, fungi, viruses and phages, and parasites, but most of the emphasis to date has been on the bacterial component of the microbiome. However, progress is being made toward defining the human virome and the role that it plays in complex microbial communities. 264 Metagenomics refers to the concept that a collection of genes sequenced from the environment could be analyzed in a way analogous to the study of a single genome. It has been facilitated by advances in NA sequencing technology, and this technology has permitted the study of microbial communities directly in their natural environment, thus bypassing the need for isolation and cultivation of individual species. We now know that the majority of microorganisms from the human body cannot be cultured in vitro. Most taxonomic metagenomic studies have used targeted sequencing of the phylogenetically informative regions of the 16s rRNA gene from bacteria because it has long been the gold standard method for bacterial identification, and there are large sequence databases and sophisticated analysis tools available. 265 However, 16s rRNA gene sequencing does not provide enough information for comprehensive microbiome studies. To overcome the limitations of single gene-based amplicon sequencing, researchers have used whole-genome shotgun sequencing on massively parallel sequencing platforms. Whole-genome approaches permit identification and annotation of diverse sets of microbial genes that encode many different biochemical or metabolic functions, thus providing functional metagenomic information.",

These materials, when widely available, should improve agreement of the results between or among different tests and aid in the establishment of their clinical utility. Another need is for the continued development of effective proficiency testing programs that will help ensure that the results of molecular tests are reliable and reproducible among laboratories. Digital PCR is the next advance in the evolution of quantitative PCR methods. Digital PCR has many applications, including detection and quantification of low numbers of pathogen sequences. It can provide a lower limit of detection than real-time PCR methods with better precision at very low concentrations. As opposed to relative quantification, digital PCR provides absolute quantification with no need for reference standards. Currently, digital PCR is used as a research tool, but it may find applications in clinical laboratories to resolve ambiguous results obtained with quantitative real-time PCR assays or for creating accurate viral reference standards as the technology becomes less costly. 273, 274 To a great extent, the future of molecular microbiology depends on automation. Many of the available tests are labor intensive, with much of the labor devoted to tedious sample processing methods. Several fully automated systems for molecular diagnostics have been developed for high-and midvolume laboratories, but most suffer from a limited test menu. To increase access to molecular tests, simple, affordable, fully automated, random access platforms with broad test menus are needed, particularly for laboratories that have a lowand midvolume of testing. NA testing for infectious diseases at the point of care is beginning to enter clinical practice in developed and developing countries, particularly for applications that require short TATs and in settings where a centralized laboratory approach is not feasible. 275 The use of multiplex NA-based assays to screen at-risk patients for panels of probable pathogens remains a goal for molecular microbiology. Several such tests are currently available, but success to date has been limited by technical complexity of some systems. The development of simple, multiparametric technologies is key to providing molecular tests with the same broad diagnostic range provided by culture and other conventional methods for syndromic diagnosis of infectious diseases.",

With the continued decrease in the cost of massively parallel NA sequencing and the increasing availability of the necessary bioinformatics tools, it is likely that our understanding of the human microbiome will result in novel microbiome-focused diagnostics and clinical interventions. In addition, the massively parallel sequencing platforms that have enabled metagenomics will be increasingly used in epidemiological investigations 276, 277 and new pathogen discovery. 278, 279 ",

However, an increasing proportion of anogenital herpetic infections in some populations is now attributed to HSV-1. HSV-1 is usually associated with oral lesions. The CDC estimates that 776,000 new HSV-2 infections occur each year in the United States. Most genital herpes infections are transmitted by persons unaware of their infections. Up to 90% of persons seropositive for HSV-2 antibody have not been diagnosed with genital herpes. However, many have mild or unrecognized disease, and probably most, if not all, shed virus from the genital area intermittently.",
