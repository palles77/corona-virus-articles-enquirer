In particular, they have excellent intrinsic activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and the atypical respiratory pathogens. Fluoroquinolones may be used as monotherapy to treat high-risk patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and for patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalisation, but not admission to intensive care. Overall, the newer fluoroquinolones often achieve clinical cure rates in \u226590% of these patients. However, rates may be lower in hospital-acquired pneumonia, and this infection should be treated on the basis of anticipated organisms and evaluation of risk factors for specific pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this setting, an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone may be used in combination with an antipseudomonal \u03b2-lactam.",

            "text": "Concerns are now being raised about the widespread use, and possibly misuse, of fluoroquinolones and the emergence of resistance among S. pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. A number of pharmacokinetic parameters such as the peak concentration of the antibacterial after a dose (Cmax), and the 24hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC24) and their relationship to pharmacodynamic parameters such as the minimum inhibitory and the mutant prevention concentrations (MIC and MPC, respectively) have been proposed to predict the effect of fluoroquinolones on bacterial killing and the emergence of resistance. Higher Cmax/MIC or AUC24/MIC and Cmax/MPC or AUC24/MPC ratios, either as a result of dose administration or the susceptibility of the organism, may lead to a better clinical outcome and decrease the emergence of resistance, respectively. Pharmacokinetic profiles that are optimised to target lowlevel resistant minor subpopulations of bacteria that often exist in infections may help preserve fluoroquinolones as a class. To this end, optimising the AUC24/ MPC or Cmax/MPC ratios is important, particularly against S. pneumoniae, in the setting of lower respiratory tract infections. Agents such as moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin with high ratios against this organism are preferred, and agents such as ciprofloxacin with low ratios should be avoided. For agents such as levofloxacin and gatifloxacin, with intermediate ratios against S. pneumoniae, it may be worthwhile considering alternative dose administration strategies, such as using higher dosages, to eradicate low-level resistant variants. This must, of course, be balanced against the potential of toxicity. Innovative approaches to the use of fluoroquinolones are worth testing in further in vitro experiments as well as in clinical trials.",

[90, 92, 93, [107] [108] [109] Overall, the 8ciprofloxacin resistance in Canada, for instance, is methoxy quinolones, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin, thought to be due to the selective pressure of fluoroand the des-fluoro(6) quinolone, garenoxacin, apquinolone use upon multiple indigenous, unrelated pear to select resistant mutants of S. pneumoniae and strains throughout the country. [87] The horizontal S. aureus at a lower rate than the older quispread of a resistant clone may still occur, although nolones. [103, 104, 110, 111] It is not clear why these differthis appears to be uncommon to date. [88] ences exist, but it may be a function of the intrinsic activity of the compounds themselves against the In Gram-positive organisms, single-step mutabacteria. For instance, one study showed that the tions in the parC/E (grlA/B) genes cause low-level most active compound against S. pneumoniae was resistance to ciprofloxacin, and mutations in the gemifloxacin (MIC = 0.03 \u03bcg/mL), followed by gyrA/B genes alone are usually not associated with a clinafloxacin (MIC = 0.06 \u03bcg/mL), trovafloxacin change in phenotype. High-level resistance occurs (MIC = 0.12 \u03bcg/mL), grepafloxacin and moxifloxonly when there are mutations in both parC/E (grlA/ acin (MIC = 0.25 \u03bcg/mL), gatifloxacin (MIC = 0.5 B) and gyrA/B genes. [89] GyrA may be the primary \u03bcg/mL), levofloxacin (MIC = 1 \u03bcg/mL) and target with other fluoroquinolones and bacteria. Data from in vitro assays show that single-step ciprofloxacin (MIC = 2 \u03bcg/mL). [112] These intrinsic mutations occur in S. aureus and S. pneumoniae activities of the compounds combined with their with frequencies often ranging from 10 -6 to pharmacokinetic profiles may be the key to under-10 -8 .

Similar differences are apparent when the MPC is used as the divisor and when ratios are calculated for alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial lining fluid. At present, interpretation of these values and their application to patient care has yet to be clarified. In general, higher pharmacodynamic ratios in serum, alveolar macrophages and epithelial lining fluid will probably lead to less selection of resistance and better patient outcomes.

[59] reviewed four studies published prior to the first quarter of 2000 where levofloxacin in dosages of 250-500mg each day were compared with cefuroxime axetil or cefaclor for the treatment of AECB. Bacterial eradication rates for levofloxacin ranged from 63% to 68% with clinical success rates ranging from 78% to 95%. The clinical success rates with the cephalosporins were in the range of 48-93%. [59] Four studies have been published since this review comparing the efficacy of levofloxacin and other agents (table VI). Masterton and Burley [203] compared 5-and 7-day courses of oral levofloxacin in patients with AECB from 48 centres in ten countries. They found equivalent clinical and microbiological success (more than 80%) for both regimens. Weiss [204] examined the relative efficacy of levofloxacin, clarithromycin and cefuroxime axetil in patients with AECB. The efficacy and tolerability of the three agents were similar and in all cases was \u226580%. File et al. [205] reported the results of studies comparing levofloxacin with an enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanic acid formulation (2000mg/ 125mg) designed for the treatment of penicillinresistant S. pneumoniae. Both regimens were 100% Ciprofloxacin [192, 193] Levofloxacin [193, 194] Gatifloxacin [195, 196] Moxifloxacin [197, 198] Gemifloxacin [199, 200] successful in eradicating S. pneumoniae from the sputum and curing the patients. [205] Amsden and coworkers [206] studied patients recruited from 21 medical centres in the US from August 1999 through May 2000 and showed equivalence of azithromycin and levofloxacin with success rates of more than 80% when the endpoints were clinical cure or improvement of AECB. The numbers were too small to show any difference in the rates of bacterial eradication. Both drugs were equally well tolerated. [206] ",

Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Raritan, New Jersey to study the efficacy of levofloxacin in CAP caused by erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant S. pneumoniae (table VI) . These studies were independently reported from 1997 through 1999, and the results of one of these studies was commented upon in a previous review of levofloxacin efficacy. [59] The overall microbiological and clinical success was good (97% and 98%, respectively) and there was no difference among patients infected with erythromycin-sensitive or -resistant organisms. In another study reported by Fogarty et al., [210] levofloxacin was compared with ceftriaxone plus erythromycin given intravenously followed by amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plus clarithromycin given orally. The overall clinical success rates and bacteria eradication rates were comparable. Gotfried and coworkers [208] examined the relative efficacy of oral levofloxacin and an extended-release formulation of clarithromycin for ambulatory patients with CAP during 1999 and 2000. Both agents appeared to be equally efficacious, with microbiological eradication rates \u226580% in most cases and clinical cure or improvement seen in more than 85% of patients. [208] From 1997 to 1999, Frank and coworkers [209] compared levofloxacin with a combined regimen of ceftriaxone and azithromycin for patients hospitalised with moderate-to-severe CAP. Both regimens were given for at least 10 days, although ceftriaxone was administered for only the first 2 days to prevent bacteraemia due to S. pneumoniae.
