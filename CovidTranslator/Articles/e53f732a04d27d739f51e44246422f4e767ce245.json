            "text": "to thousands of human beings. However, the active drug in treating SARS has not been found yet. The genome sequences determined by several groups [1] [2] [3] show that it is a variant of coronaviruses, belonging to single-stranded plus sense RNA viruses. The genome is about 30 kb in length, and its several encoded proteins have been separated and purified. This provides a sound basis for SARS related pharmaceutical research and development . The use of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to manipulate gene expression (RNA interference or RNAi) has been proved highly effective, at least 10 times more effective than either using sense or antisense RNAs alone [4] . The RNAi triggered by dsRNA is a phenomenon of homology-dependent gene silencing [5] [6] [7] . It was found that the small interfering RNA (siRNA, 21-25 nt long) plays an important role in RNAi-related gene silencing pathways [8] . Progress has also been made in anti-HIV and anti-HCV drug design by applying the method of RNA interference [9] - [10] . To design anti-SARS-CoV drug, one strategy is to search for siRNAs which specifically interfere the gene expression and block the genome replication of SARS-associated coronavirus. In this note we shall make theoretical prediction on the possible target sites of siRNAs in the virus genome. 4 sites of RNA interference when these segments frequently occurred in non-base-paired regions based on the above calculation. A given RNA sequence segment may have different configurations of secondary structure with lower free energy, some containing short stems (quasi-free) but some not (free). The total frequency of a segment occurring in non-base-paired region of different folds is called appearance rate. If each quasi-free case is multiplied by a reduced factor in numeration, namely, by 0.9 for 1 base pair, 0.8 for 2 base pair, and 0.7 for 3 base pairs (base pairs may be continuous in structure or disconnected) then the total number of folds is called reduced appearance rate.",
