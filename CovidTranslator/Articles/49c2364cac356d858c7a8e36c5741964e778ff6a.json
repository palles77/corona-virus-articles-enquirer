We agree that the meaning of cardiopulmonary arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitative measures, including survival data, needs to be explained in detail to the patient or next of kin/healthcare proxy. We also fully agree that if CPR were explained in detail, most, if not all, of the octogenarian patients and their families would choose a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order. In our experience, when CPR is explained through informed consent, then the refusal rate is more than 90%. However, the assertion by Dr. Bowers that all hospitals should require informed consent for patients requesting CPR goes to the extreme and negates the basics of medicine: the sanctity of life, and changes the focus from saving life to that of withholding treatment. By making DNR the defaulted choice and CPR requiring informed consent would imply that life would not be maintained unless it is requested. This recommendation is not only entirely opposite to current practice, but contrary to the Hippocratic oath that is pledged by physicians 2 and also in opposition to the three Abrahamic monotheistic religions. 3 In addition, it is in contradiction to current existing medical, ethical, and legal standards.",

The CDC has recommended a \"Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette Strategy for Healthcare Facilities,\" including specific \"Recommendations for Long-Term Care Facilities.\" 2 My editorial mentions the lack of sensitive, real-time diagnostic tests to determine which organism is responsible for cough and fever in a resident with an acute change in status. Even the rapid influenza tests have problems with sensitivity. The editorial also mentions that familiar respiratory viruses such as influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), especially complicated by pneumonia, have mortality rates in nursing home residents greater than the 9% figure cited for SARS cases in the community. Because clinicians seldom know the precise etiology of an infectious respiratory syndrome, the CDC now recommends universal respiratory hygiene for all patients who present with an infectious respiratory syndrome, especially during periods of increased respiratory activity in the community (ie, evidence of ongoing transmission). The approach includes droplet secretion precautions. Given the fact that influenza, SARS-CoV, parainfluenza, and RSV are all transmissible and potentially lethal in nursing home residents, and could be clinically indistinguishable, it seems prudent to initially approach all residents with symptoms of acute respiratory infection with droplet secretion precautions modified to the reality of your facility.

Many GNP educational programs include content on nursing facility culture and processes, which can affect patient care. Geriatric nurse practitioners have had a positive impact on individual patients with attention to the geriatric syndromes, 6 and geriatric clinical nurse specialists have been adept at influencing the system of care delivery. 7 It appears the model in the study was primarily a physician substitution model with less attention to augmenting nursing services.",

Progress visits were to be made every 60 days, alternating with the physician. This goal was not met because residents were seen only 4.6 times per year for progress visits when six would have been expected. The APNs managed approximately 14 paged or voicemail messages annually per patient but made only three acute visits per patient per year as a team. The APNs could have missed opportunities to intervene early in acute illness and prevent emergency department visits or hospitalizations. The American Medical Directors' Association (AMDA) has suggested one visit per month could be appropriate for a person who requires nursing care around the clock and one visit a week for persons receiving skilled nursing facility (SNF) services under Medicare part A. 5 The physician-only arm consisted of physicians who would continue to follow their own patients as they entered nursing facilities in the community. Thus, patients were followed by a provider who presumably knew them and their families very well. The patients in this study were all in the same eight nursing facilities. Given the mix of the team-patients and physician-only patients in the same facilities, this leaves open the possibility that any benefit from the APN presence was also seen with the physicianonly group, resulting in a halo effect.
