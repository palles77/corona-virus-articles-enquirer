A major thrust in vaccine research focuses on developing formulations with virus-like features towards enhancing antigen presentation and immune processing. Herein, a facile approach to formulate synthetic virus-like particles (sVLPs) is demonstrated by exploiting the phenomenon of protein corona formation induced by the high-energy surfaces of synthetic nanoparticles. Using an avian coronavirus spike protein as a model antigen, sVLPs were prepared by incubating 100 nm gold nanoparticles in a solution containing an optimized concentration of viral proteins. Following removal of free proteins, antigen-laden particles were recovered and showed morphological semblance to natural viral particles under nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy. As compared to inoculation with free proteins, vaccination with the sVLPs showed enhanced lymphatic antigen delivery, stronger antibody titers, increased splenic T-cell response, and reduced infection-associated symptoms in an avian model of coronavirus infection. Comparison to a commercial whole inactivated virus vaccine also showed evidence of superior antiviral protection by the sVLPs. The study demonstrates a simple yet robust method in bridging viral antigens with synthetic nanoparticles for improved vaccine application; it has practical implications in the management of human viral infections as well as in animal agriculture.",

Amidst continuing and emerging viral threats, vaccine technology continues to advance with the aim of effectively promoting antiviral immune responses, and a major development effort lies in retaining or integrating virus-like features in vaccine formulations for improved immune processing. Several morphological and antigenic characteristics of viral particles have been demonstrated to promote immune potentiation. For example, particles at the nanoscale have been shown to have better lymphatic transport as compared to smaller subunit antigens [1, 2] . In addition, the display of multiple antigens on a single particle facilitates more effective antigen presentation to immune cells [1] . As compared to traditional vaccine formulations, vaccines preserving virus-like features have shown superior capability in eliciting immune responses [3e5] . These results and observations have also prompted material scientists to apply synthetic nanomaterials towards mimicking viral features for vaccine development [6e9] .",

            "text": "Given their high radii of curvature, synthetic nanoparticles frequently possess high surface energies that induce adsorption of biomolecules in a phenomenon known as protein corona formation. In protein-rich media, strong nanoparticle/protein association occurs spontaneously as a means to passivate surface energies, and the resulting particles are encased in a protein layer that dictates the particles' interactions with the environment [10, 11] . While protein corona formation is gaining increasing scientific interest owing to its implications in biomedical applications [10, 12, 13] , we herein demonstrate harnessing this phenomenon can be beneficial towards mimicking viral features for vaccine applications. We show that synthetic virus-like particles (sVLPs) with close semblance to native virions in physicochemical properties and antigen display can be facilely prepared through spontaneous antigen-particle association in optimized incubation conditions. Using 100 nm gold nanoparticles (AuNP), a biologically inert material commonly used for biomedical research [14e16] , and a spike glycoprotein derived from an avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the family Coronaviridae [17] , we controlled the incubation condition to prepare spike glycoprotein-laden sVLPs (Fig. 1) . The morphological features and antigen display by the sVLPs were compared to native IBV viral particles using nanoparticle tracking analysis and immunogold staining. In addition, vaccination potency between the sVLPs and free spike glycoproteins was compared in an avian model of coronavirus infection. A commercial whole inactivated virus (WIV) formulation that is the current standard vaccine for IBV management was examined in parallel.",

The IBV spike glycoprotein, which forms the large, pental-shaped spikes on the surface of the virion, is chosen as the antigen candidate as it is implicated as a determinant of virus pathogenicity. Among coronaviruses, spike glycoproteins possess a variety of biological functions, including triggering cell attachment, inducing cell-cell fusion, and binding to cellular receptors [19, 20] . As spike glycoproteins are the primary targets in ongoing vaccine development efforts for coronavirus vaccinations, the present study has broad implications across both human and animal disease management [21, 22] .",

Between AuNPs and sVLPs, we observed an overall reduction in the light scattering intensity. Given that AuNPs are known to scatter light at an extraordinary efficiency, the intensity reduction in sVLPs can be attributed to successful protein coating, which restricts light passage to the AuNP surfaces. Likewise, native virions have the lowest light scattering under the analysis as they are comprised entirely of organic materials.

In PBS, particle-bound antigen level remained steady over a span of 24 h, yielding similar IBV spike protein band intensities across the different incubation samples (Fig. 2H) . A rapid drop-off in particlebound spike protein was observed upon incubation in 10% BSA. Immediate retrieval of sVLPs from the BSA solution resulted in~65% reduction in the spike protein level, and at the 24 h mark,~25% of the initial antigen remained on the sVLPs. This observation suggests the formation of two distinctive corona layers distinguishable by their interaction dynamics with surrounding biomolecules, reflecting the presence of both a reversible \"soft corona\" and an irreversible \"hard corona\" that have been frequently observed in prior nanoparticle studies [35e37]. The results indicate that approximately 200e250 IBV spike proteins are stably bound to each sVLPs. These proteins are expected to remain in the particulate form in complex biological environments upon in vivo administration.",

Popliteal lymph nodes, which are the draining lymph nodes by the footpads, were subsequently collected and sectioned for immunofluorescence assay. IBV spike protein-specific immunofluorescence staining showed a significantly enhanced antigen delivery by the sVLPs as compared to the free protein formulation, resulting in an increased number of fluorescent punctates (green) in the lymph node sections (Fig. 3A) . Imaging analysis on multiple lymph node sections showed that the sVLP formulation increased lymphatic delivery by approximately 6 fold (Fig. 3B) . The observation of increased delivery attests to the strong protein/particle binding in the \"hard corona\" layer as the particle carrier is capable of facilitating antigen transport in vivo. The enhanced lymph node localization of the sVLPs is consistent with prior observations on nanoparticles and virus-like particles [2] . Owing to their nanoscale morphology and physicochemical properties, these nanoparticles are known to facilitate free lymphatic drainage via convective transport [38, 39] as well as cell-mediated lymphatic delivery via increased cellular uptake [2] .",

The improved immunogenicity can be explained in part by the enhanced antigen delivery to the lymph node, where a high number of antigen presenting cells reside. In addition, the particulate nature of the sVLPs likely also favors other immune activation mechanisms, such as improved cellular uptake, enhanced complement activation [38] and presentation by follicular dendritic cells [40] .

As an additional reference, a commercial WIV vaccine for IBV was administered based on the manufacturer's suggested dosage. Following vaccination, blood and tear were collected for analysis and a live IBV challenge was performed (Fig. 4A) . ELISA analysis showed that the sVLPs were superior in generating both IgG and IgA titers as compared to the free protein formulation and the WIV vaccine (Fig. 4B,C) . The total IgA in the tears of the vaccinated chickens were also quantified. Despite that intramuscular vaccination is generally known to be non-ideal for promoting mucosal immunity [41] , elevation of tear IgA level was observed for all three vaccine formulations (Fig. 4D) . It is expected that mucosal vaccination in future studies may further increase tear IgA levels and better highlight the differences among the formulations in eliciting mucosal immunity. Besides humoral immunity, cellular immunity, a major component of effective antiviral immune responses [42] , was analyzed using splenocytes extracted on day 28. The sVLP sample showed a significant increase in the IFN-g mRNA level as compared to the control, free protein, and the WIV vaccine samples (Fig. 4E) , demonstrating superior promotion of antigen-specific cellular immunity. We further examined the effect of the different vaccinations in protecting against a viral challenge. Clinical scores evaluated based on stamina, posture, and voice show that the sVLP group had the lowest overall symptoms, on par with animals vaccinated with the WIV formulation (Fig. 5A,B) . In comparison, vaccination with the free protein formulation was less effective and highly variable in moderating the disease symptoms. On day 28, necropsies were performed to examine the tracheas and kidneys, which are characteristic sites for infections by IBV [43] . As indicated in the gross lesion photos, the best antiviral protection was observed in the sVLP-immunized group, whereas organs from the free protein group and the WIV vaccine group showed observable mucus secretion and petechiae in tracheas (Fig. 5D, upper panel, arrowed) and swollen lesions and hemorrhages in kidneys (Fig. 5D, lower panel, arrowed) . The prophylactic effect of the sVLP vaccination was further demonstrated by examining the viral load in kidneys. Analysis by quantitative RT-PCR showed that immunization with sVLPs more consistently reduced the viral content, resulting in the lowest relative viral mRNA expression across the animal samples (Fig. 5C) . The results further corroborate the protective effect by the sVLP vaccination, which enhanced both humoral and cellular immunity for increased protection against the viral challenge.",

As these proteins comprise the outermost layer of coronaviruses, the spike proteins have a pivotal role in viral pathogenesis and are recognized as the primary target for vaccine preparations [44] . Present vaccination strategies for coronaviruses include recombinant viruses and viruslike particles, and there is a continuing effort in developing new strategies for improving vaccine potency and safety [22] . To the best of our knowledge, incorporating coronavirus spike protein with synthetic nanoparticles has not been previously explored. By exploiting the high surface energies of synthetic nanoparticles, spontaneous assembly of sVLPs covered with IBV spike proteins were demonstrated. The strong particle/antigen association resulted in virus-sized particulates displaying IBV spike proteins, and the sVLPs elicited strong immune protection against a live IBV challenge. The enhanced immunopotentiation by the particle carrier is consistent with previous studies and echoes the curious observation that gold nanoparticles not only promote humoral but also cellular immune responses upon association with antigens [14, 15] . As the increased cellular immune response suggests that the nanoparticles may play a role beyond a passive antigen carrier, future studies examining the impact of nanomaterials and nanoparticle surface energies on immunological interactions are warranted.",

Subtle changes on the environment and on nanoparticle properties can have dramatic and unpredictable impact on the overall corona identity with significant biological implications. To demonstrate a practical utility for the protein corona phenomenon, the present study adopts a reductionist approach in examining protein-particle interactions. AuNPs are incubated in a highly controlled condition with proteins of a singular species to form sVLPs with virus-mimetic features, and the dynamics of such association are expected to vary with different biomolecules and nanomaterials [48] . In general, inorganic nanoparticles promote stronger protein adsorption as compared to organic nanoparticles as inorganic nanoparticles tend to have higher surface energies. Decreasing particle size also tends to increase biomolecule interactions as it increases radii of curvature of nanoparticle surfaces. Other forces, such as electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces and covalent interactions all play intertwining roles in governing the nano-bio interface, and factors including nanoparticle functionalizations, buffer conditions, and biomolecule species have significant impact on the corona formation [48] . Nonetheless, in a controlled and optimized condition, the phenomenon may be exploited to facilely prepare formulations with defined characteristics and favorable biological performance.",

In comparison to typical virus-like particle preparations, the present strategy offers practical advantages owing to its simple and facile process. Amidst the growing health threats of coronavirus infections as well as the ongoing economic impact of IBV infections, virus-like particles are garnering increasing scientific interest as vaccine candidates owing to their improved efficacy in comparison to subunit antigens [49, 50] . In the present study, vaccination with the sVLPs resulted in enhanced humoral and cellular immune responses, improving protection against an avian model of coronavirus infection as compared to free protein antigens and a commercial WIV vaccine. Strong immunity against the viral challenge following sVLP vaccination was evidenced by multiple criteria, including improved physical symptoms, reduced organ lesions, and decreased overall viral load. The enhanced immunopotentiation by the sVLPs is attributable at least in part to increased lymphatic delivery and multivalent antigen display. Given the robustness and versatility of the approach, it can be envisioned the technique can be broadly applied for different vaccine development.",
