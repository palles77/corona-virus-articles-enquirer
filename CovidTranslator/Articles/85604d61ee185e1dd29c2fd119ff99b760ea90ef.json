Despite the fact that Hardy et al. (S) demonstrated that a feline leulwmia virus antigen was present in 5 of 13 cats with spontaneous I;II' and feline leukemia virus was found in electron micrographs from tissues of 1 of the 5 cats, in our study of various tissues from 25 cats with experimentally induced FIP, morphological forms of feline leukemia virus, as described by various workers (h-6), have never been seen. This paper reports the morphogenesis of :I virus as detected in tissues from 12 of the 25 cats with experimental P'II'.",
