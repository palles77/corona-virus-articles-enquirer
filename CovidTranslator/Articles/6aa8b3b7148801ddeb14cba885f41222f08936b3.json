            "text": "The genus Rotavirus is classified as a member of the family Reoviridae of the RNA viruses. Rotaviruses are round parti-cles 68 nm in diameter and are composed of two separate shells (capsids). The capsids surround a 38-nm icosahedral core structure, which in turn encloses the 11 double strands of RNA in the core. This structure gives the virus its characteristic appearance of a wide-rimmed wheel with spokes radiating from the hub, from which its name was derived (rota is Latin for 'wheel'). 8 Rotaviruses are classified based on antigenic properties of various proteins found in the capsid stricture. The VP6 protein on the inner capsid of the virus determines the rotavirus group. 4 Most viruses infecting humans are classified as group A, although rotaviruses from groups B and C have occasionally been associated with human diarrheal disease as well. The next level of classification is the subgroup, which is determined by other antigenic differences among the VP6 proteins. At least two subgroups are known to exist. 4 Subgroup typing has proved important in the study of patients who experience more than one episode of rotaviral infection. In these patients, recurrent infections usually but not necessarily involve agents of different subgroups, which suggests that subgroup antigens are not sufficient for inducing the production of protective antibodies. 9 Finally, the rotaviruses are classified into a variety of serotypes based on the antigenic differences of VP7 glycoprotein or the VP4 protease-sensitive hemagglutinin proteins that are found in the outer capsid. 10 VP7-based serotypes are now referred to as G types (for glycoprotein in VP7); G types 1 through 4 are responsible for most infections in children. VP4 serotypes are called P types (representing protease sensitivity of VP4). Reassortments of VP7 and VP4 have been used in candidate rotavirus vaccines.",

Spread by water is likely. Respiratory transmission has been suggested but not proved. 12 Although the virus may affect all age groups, it most commonly produces disease in children between 6 and 24 months of age.

This protection increases with each new infection and reduces the severity of diarrhea. 41 The strategy for developing effective oral rotavirus vaccine involves the use of live, attenuated strains that should protect an infant by the same mechanism as natural infection. The most extensively studied strategy for rotavirus vaccination has been the Jennerian approach, which uses an antigenically related rotavirus strain from an animal host as the immunogen to induce protection. Attenuated bovine strains were initially tried; 42 these were protective in some populations but not others. This variability was in part attributed to the antigenic differences in circulating strains and the failure of animal strains to elicit heterotypic protection in some studies. To increase the efficacy of the Jennerian approach, second-generation polyvalent reassortment vaccines have been developed. These contain neutralization antigens that can provide homotypic (serotype-specific) immunity against the four epidemiologically important group A rotavirus VP7 serotypes. These vaccines, which are based on attenuated human and rhesus strains, are not highly effective at preventing infection but do have an efficacy of more than 80% in preventing dehydration associated with severe diarrhea. [43] [44] [45] A rotavirus vaccine (Rotashield, Wyeth-Ayerst, St. David's, PA) was approved for use in the USA and was placed on the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommended vaccination schedule. While the vaccine was efficacious, an increased incidence of intussusception within 2 weeks of receiving the vaccine was identified by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), leading to voluntary withdrawal by the manufacturer. 46 While no alternate vaccines are licensed in the USA at this time, several are in clinical trials and have been licensed in other countries. 47",

Subsequently, a number of similar etiologic agents were identified; before the cloning of the prototype Norwalk virus genome, 49, 50 these viruses, which were a group of morphologically diverse, positive-stranded RNA viruses that caused acute gastroenteritis, were identified as Norwalk-like agents. These organisms were also named for the communities in which they were first isolated (e.g. Montgomery County, Hawaii, Snow Mountain, Taunton, Otofuke and Sapporo viruses). Based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the sequence structure of these viruses has enabled their classification as human calciviruses (HuCV).",

These volunteers had repeat biopsies 2 weeks after the illness and normal histology was again present. Other investigators have demonstrated the presence of normal gastric and rectal histology in patients affected by norovirus as is typical of viral gastroenteritis. 55 ",

The more recent findings of torovirus-like particles by immunoassay, using validated anti-Breda virus antiserum, lends additional weight to the hypothesis that these are agents of human gastroenteritis. 86 Their causative role in human disease, however, remains unproven.

The more classic form of shigellosis, however, is bacillary dysentery. This illness usually begins with fever and malaise, followed by watery diarrhea and cramping abdominal pain. By the second day of illness, blood and mucus are usually present in the stools and tenesmus has become a prominent symptom. At this point, in approximately 50% of affected patients, the stool volume decreases, with only scant amounts of blood and mucus being passed. 111 This pattern of bloody, mucus-containing stools is referred to as dysentery. Bacteremia is an uncommon feature of this illness, but several other complications have been reported, including seizures (in children), arthritis, purulent keratitis and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Non-suppurative arthritis is the most commonly occurring extraintestinal complication of shigellosis. Patients who carry the histocompatible locus antigen HLA-B27 may be predisposed to the development of this complication as well as to the development of Reiter's syndrome. 114 The association of seizures with shigellosis was earlier attributed to the neurotoxic effect of the Shigella toxin (Shiga toxin). It now seems likely, however, that the seizures may simply represent a subgroup of common febrile seizures and have no direct relation to the effects of Shiga toxin.",

Intracytoplasmic bacteria move rapidly, in association with a comet tail made up of host cell actin filaments. When moving bacteria reach the cell margin, they push out long protrusions with the bacteria at the tips that are then taken up by neighboring cells, allowing the infection to spread from cell to cell (Fig. 36.3) . 97 Shiga toxin is elaborated by all species, although in greater amounts by S. dysenteriae than by other species, 111 and may play a role in the pathogenesis of Shigella infection. The toxin has neurotoxic, enterotoxic and cytotoxic effects. 111 Structurally, it is composed of an active, or A, subunit (molecular weight 32 kD) surrounded by five binding, or B, subunits (77 kD). 111 The B subunits bind to cellspecific receptors and are taken up by endocytosis. Within the cells, the B subunits are cleaved away and the remaining A subunit is shortened by proteolysis. This molecule is thought then to bind to the 60S ribosome and inhibit protein synthesis, leading to cell death and sloughing. 117 This is the presumed mechanism for the cytotoxic effect. An enterotoxic effect of Shiga toxin in the ileum may account for the early watery diarrhea.",

Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy typically reveals a friable mucosa, possibly with discrete ulcers. Rectal biopsy may be useful to differentiate shigellosis from ulcerative colitis. 118 In addition to rehydration, antimicrobial therapy has been recommended for Shigella (1) to shorten the course of the disease, (2) to decrease the period of excretion of the organisms 119 and (3) to decrease the secondary attack rate, since humans provide the only reservoir for the organism. However, handwashing, rather than use of antimicrobials, is the most effective method to prevent person-to-person spread. Those clinicians who advise against the routine treatment of shigellosis with antibiotics argue that (1) the disease is most often self-limited and (2) the use of antibiotics may facilitate the development of resistant strains 120 and may increase the likelihood developing HUS as a sequela. 112 We recommend antibiotic therapy only for patients who are severely ill at the time of diagnosis or who remain ill at the time of identification of Shigella in a stool culture.",

In general, in these studies, antimicrobial therapy was begun late in the course of the illness. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, Salazar-Lindo and colleagues 133 demonstrated a shortened duration of illness, from 4.2 to 2.5 days, in patients who received erythromycin by day 4 of their illness.

In addition, there may be an increased incidence in the summer months. 134, 138 Pathogenesis Y. enterocolitica constitutes a heterogeneous group of serotypes with many identified virulence factors. 139 Y. enterocolitica produces disease in the intestine through an invasive route. After penetrating the mucosal epithelium, primarily in the ileum, organisms replicate in Peyer's patches and accumulate in the mesenteric lymph nodes. 134 Most serotypes produce an enterotoxin similar to the E. coli heat-stable toxin but only at temperatures lower than 30\u02daC; therefore, this toxin may not have an important role in disease production by Yersinia in the human intestine. There is speculation on the role of preformed toxin in causing disease, because toxin may be produced when the organisms are present in refrigerated foods. 134 The virulence of Y. enterocolitica has been shown to be plasmid related. Different serotypes exhibit different degrees of virulence. Serotypes O:3 and O:9 are the ones most frequently associated with diarrheal disease in Europe and Japan, whereas a larger number of serotypes are seen in North America. 139 ",

Volunteer studies have shown that a relatively large number of organisms (approximately 10 11 ) must be ingested to produce symptoms. 145 Similar to other ingested organisms, V. cholerae must survive the acidic gastric environment. The importance of gastric acidity as a host-protective factor is borne out by the increased occurrence of cholera in patients with absent or reduced gastric acidity. 89, 157 The organisms travel to the small intestine, where they adhere to the epithelium. This process may be aided by production of mucinase. 157 The intestinal epithelium remains intact with normal morphology. 158 Vibrio species produce a toxin that is composed of a central subunit (A) surrounded by five B subunits; the latter bind to a ganglioside, GM 1 , which serves as the toxin receptor. This binding facilitates the transfer of the A subunit across the cell membrane, where it is cleaved into two components, denoted A 1 and A 2 . The disulfide linkage between A 1 and A 2 is reduced to liberate an active A 1 peptide, which acts as a catalyst to facilitate the transfer of adenosine diphosphateribose from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to a guanyl nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G s ). G s then stimulates adenylate cyclase, located on the basolateral membrane, thereby increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate. This result in turn leads to chloride secretion and a net flux of fluid into the intestinal lumen. 159 Although this mechanism of toxin action adequately explains the clinical symptoms of cholera, similar symptoms have been noted in patients infected with strains that do not produce the classic cholera toxin. This has led to the recognition that V. cholerae harbors additional virulence factors in the bacterial genome that may contribute to diarrheal disease and must be considered in the design of a non-reactigenic vaccine. Newly recognized toxins produced by V. cholerae include zonula occludens toxin and the accessory cholera toxin. 160, 161 ",

This has led to speculation that some members of this group, namely V. parahaemolyticus, may be capable of invasiveness as well as toxin production. 169 In the USA, gastroenteritis caused by these vibrios is most often associated with the ingestion of raw oysters. 171 Gastroenteritis caused by non-O1 vibrios tends to be far milder than that caused by V. cholerae.

            "text": "EPEC is a major cause of diarrhea in developing countries. As many as 30-40% of cases of infant diarrhea, particularly in those infants less than 6-months of age, may be caused by EPEC and in some studies the frequency of EPEC infection exceeds that of rotavirus. [174] [175] [176] [177] In North America and the UK, EPEC infections were common during the 1940s through the 1960s; now they are most commonly associated with sporadic cases and nosocomial or daycare outbreaks. 178, 179 However, because of the general unavailability of serotyping, the true incidence of EPEC-associated diarrhea may be underestimated. A 1997 study in Seattle children with diarrhea, in which DNA probes were used to screen E. coli present in stool, found a high incidence of EPEC-like organisms (atypical EPEC) in this population. 180 The hallmark of EPEC infection is the 'attaching and effacing' lesion seen in the intestine. 179 adherence between the bacterium and the epithelial cell membrane. Directly beneath the surface of the adherent organism, there are marked cytoskeletal changes in the enterocyte, including accumulation of actin polymers. Often, the bacteria are raised on a pedestal-like structure as a result of this actin accumulation. A number of steps are probably responsible for the development of this attaching and effacing lesion. As proposed by Donnenberg and Kaper, 182 EPEC pathogenesis consists of three phases: (1) localized adherence, which brings the bacteria in close contact with the enterocyte (e.g. docking); (2) signal transduction, including increases in intracellular calcium and protein phosphorylation; and (3) intimate adherence, a multigene process encoded in the bacterium by a locus of enterocyte effacement. 183, 184 The dramatic loss of absorptive microvilli in the intestine presumably leads to diarrhea via malabsorption. Although this is probably the predominant mechanism, some evidence suggests that a separate secretory mechanism is also involved. Patients with symptomatic EPEC infection typically experience diarrhea, vomiting, malaise and fever. The stool may contain mucus but does not usually contain blood. Symptoms with EPEC infection are more severe than with some other enteric infections and may persist for 2 weeks or longer. 172 In some patients, EPEC has caused protracted diarrhea with dehydration, malnutrition and zinc deficiency as complications; treatment with parenteral hyperalimentation has been required. 179 EPEC can be detected by serotyping of isolated E. coli, 178, 185 by demonstration of the presence of the enterocyte adherence factor or other virulence genes using molecular probes, 186 or by identification of the attaching and effacing phenotype using tissue culture cells. 187 These assays are not commonly used in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Diagnosis of EPEC may be made by demonstrating the presence of adherent organisms on small intestinal or rectal biopsy. 178, 179, 185 Although controlled studies of antibiotic therapy for EPEC have been few, the significant morbidity associated with this agent argues for treatment with antibiotics in most cases. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (trimethoprim, 5 mg/kg, max. 160 mg, plus sulfamethoxazole, 25 mg/kg, max. 800 mg, per dose, given every 12 h) has been used with some success, as have oral neomycin and gentamicin.",

There the bacteria depend on fimbriae (also called pili) to facilitate attachment to the mucosal surface and overcome the forward motion of peristalsis. This attachment process causes no detectable struc-tural changes in the architecture of the brush border membrane but does allow the bacteria to release their enterotoxins, heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable toxin (ST), in close proximity to the enterocyte brush border membrane where toxin receptors are present. 190 These toxins in turn stimulate adenylate cyclase (in the case of LT) or guanylate cyclase (in the case of ST) and both ultimately result in a net fluid secretion from the intestine (see the reviews by Cohen and Giannella 191 and by Sears and Kaper) . 192 Two endogenous ligands for the ST receptor, guanylin and uroguanylin, have been identified. 193, 194 This discovery is consistent with the hypothesis that ST is a superagonist and exerts its diarrheal action by means of usurping a normal secretory mechanisms in the intestine (e.g. by molecular mimicry of these less potent endogenous ligands). Uroguanylin may also act as a hormone regulating salt and water excretion in the kidney in response to an oral salt load. 195 Clinically, ETEC infection causes nausea, abdominal pain and watery diarrhea. Stools typically contain neither mucus nor leukocytes. ETEC can be diagnosed with the use of bioassays such as the suckling mouse assay, 196 immunoassays, or gene probes specific for either ST 197 or LT. 198 PCR assays are also available. However, none of these assays is commonly used in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Supportive measures are sufficient therapy for most cases of ETEC diarrhea, with oral rehydration a mainstay of therapy. Antibiotics, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, have been shown to decrease the duration of fecal excretion of the organisms. 199 Quinolone antibiotics may be more effective, 200 but they are not recommended for use in children.",

            "text": "Stx-producing E. coli infections may occur in sporadic cases, but they have also been associated with outbreaks of disease in nursing homes, daycare centers and other institutions; several reviews have been published. [205] [206] [207] [208] It is estimated that E. coli O157:H7 causes approximately 10 000 to 20 000 infections per year in the USA alone and may be responsible for 250 deaths annually. 209 Inadequately cooked hamburgers were most likely the source of the first outbreak 186 and remain the most common vehicle of transmission. In 1993 there was a large epidemic in the western USA; inadequately cooked hamburgers were again implicated as the cause. Other, small epidemics have been attributed to apple juice or cider and large-scale outbreaks in Japan have been associated with bean sprouts. Contaminated water has also been a source of infection. 210, 211 Common to all of these outbreaks is a reservoir of Stx-producing E. coli in the intestines of cattle and other animals who are asymptomatic. Infection is spread either by direct contact with intestinal contents or through droppings or water runoff from contaminated pastures. A low infectious dose for Stx-producing E. coli and the resistance of these organisms to gastric acid and to the food preserving process (high salt and drying) contribute to the high attack rate. The low infectious dose also contributes to frequent person-to-person transmission. [205] [206] [207] [208] Both the very old and the very young appear to be at increased risk for Stx-producing E. coli infection and its complications. [205] [206] [207] [208] Clinical features and complications of E. coli O157:H7 infection include bloody diarrhea, nonbloody diarrhea, HUS, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and, uncommonly, asymptomatic infection. 205 Symptoms may persist for several days or, less commonly, for several weeks. Early reports suggested that carriage of the organism was brief and that prompt culture was necessary to recover these organisms. 212, 213 More recently, prolonged shedding has been observed. 214, 215 This has led to the recommendation that two negative stool cultures be obtained before a child is allowed to return to daycare. 214 The identification of Stx-producing E. coli is made difficult because it is not possible to differentiate diseaseproducing E. coli from normal enteric flora on the basis of standard microbiologic techniques. There are currently six techniques for identification of Stx-producing E. coli: biochemical markers with serotyping (most commonly used), serum antibody tests, cytotoxin bioassays, DNA hybridization, PCR-based tests and cytotoxin detection (including ELISAs). Some of these methods (e.g. toxin-based assays) detect the presence of cytotoxin-producing organisms, including non-O157 serotypes. It may be important to use both biochemical markers and toxin-based assays in clinical practice to identify these organisms. 216 Prevention of disease transmission is made difficult by the fact that these organisms colonize the intestine of healthy cattle and other food animals, including beef, pork, lamb and poultry. Therefore, they can survive and multiply in the food chain. Proper cooking destroys these organisms; in hamburgers, an internal cooking temperature of 71\u02daC (160\u02daF) renders the meat safe. Practically, safe cooking most commonly results in a gray hamburger (not pink), with clear juices. Risk can be lowered by educating consumers about cross-contamination, use of warning labels now affixed to meat in the USA and improvements in meat processing and microbial contamination detection.",

Hemorrhagic colitis has been confused with a number of other conditions, including ischemic colitis, appendicitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, cecal polyp, pseudomembranous colitis and an acute abdomen (ileitis). Therefore, an important aspect of treatment of Stxassociated hemorrhagic colitis is making the correct diagnosis and avoiding unnecessary diagnostic studies such as angiography and laparotomy. The mainstay of therapy for hemorrhagic colitis is the management of dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities and gastrointestinal blood loss. Antimicrobial agents may help by killing the bacterial pathogens, but they may also cause harm by increasing the release and subsequent absorption of Shiga toxin. 217 Trials of antibiotic treatment of Stx-producing E. coli infection are inconclusive. Although these organisms are uniformly sensitive to antimicrobials in vitro, at present there is no convincing evidence that antimicrobial therapy is helpful in diminishing the severity of illness, shortening the duration of fecal excretion, or preventing HUS. 218, 219 Of greater concern is a study suggesting an increased incidence of HUS in those treated with anti-microbials. 220 An attempt to assimilate findings of published series on the subject via a meta-analysis failed to identify an increased risk of HUS in those treated with antimicrobials. 221 Regardless, until more data is available on this topic, most experts would agree that treatment of Stx-producing E. coli with antimicrobials is not advisable. 222 A multi-center trial failed to demonstrate an improved clinical course in pediatric patients treated with Shiga toxin-binding resin. 223 Other toxin neutralizing therapies are currently under investigation.",

            "text": "Studies in Australian children with diarrhea have found Aeromonas species present in 10% of patients. 248 Infection appears to occur most frequently in children younger than 2 years of age. 249 Of patients with Aeromonas isolated from stool cultures at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center approximately 50% were younger than 3 months. Aeromonas infection is also seasonal, occurring more often in the summer months. 246 Not all Aeromonas species are pathogenic. The method of pathogenesis remains unclear. Both cytotoxic 249 and enterotoxic 246 properties have been observed, but neither these nor other pathogenic mechanisms are found consistently in strains isolated from patients with Aeromonasassociated disease. 247 Aeromonas caviae, a commonly isolated species, demonstrates both adherence and cytotoxin production. 250 Clinical symptoms attributed to Aeromonas can be grouped into three categories: (1) acute watery diarrhea, the most common syndrome; (2) dysentery, which usually is self-limited; and (3) persistent watery diarrhea. Cramping abdominal pain and vomiting may also occur. 249 Symptoms may occasionally be severe and, especially when dysentery is present, have been incorrectly diagnosed as ulcerative colitis. 248 In mild cases of Aeromonas infection, supportive treatment should suffice. In patients who are immunocompromised, are otherwise acutely ill, or have persistent illness, treatment with antibiotics is recommended. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is usually effective (trimethoprim, 5 mg/kg, max. 160 mg, plus sulfamethoxazole, 25 mg/kg, max. 800 mg, per dose, given every 12 h for 14 days), as are tetracycline, chloramphenicol and the aminoglycosides. 246 Most strains of Aeromonas are resistant to the penicillins, including ampicillin. 246 Plesiomonas P. shigelloides, like Aeromonas, is commonly found in the environment, 251 especially in bodies of water, including water from a home aquarium. 252 Unlike Aeromonas, however, Plesiomonas has been reported to occur in epidemics, with contaminated water often found to be the cause. 251 Plesiomonas is also known to be spread through improperly cooked seafood. 253 The pathogenesis of disease caused by P. shigelloides is not well understood. A cytotoxin has been found in some strains 251 but not in others. An invasive mechanism is also suspected, because of the colitis symptoms. 253 In addition to small-volume stools with leukocytes and possible blood, patients may also experience severe abdominal pain. Fever has been seen in approximately one-third of patients. 253 In one group of adult patients, symptoms persisted longer than 2 weeks in 75% and longer than 4 weeks in 32%. 253 Diagnosis of P. shigelloides is made by stool culture. Although this illness is usually self-limited, treatment with antimicrobial agents has been shown to decrease the duration of symptoms, 253 with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or aminoglycosides suggested as appropriate choices. There are no controlled trials of antimicrobial treatment of gastroenteritis caused by this organism.",

Undoubtedly, as techniques for identification and culture become more sophisticated, other causative agents will be identified and the percentage of diarrheal illnesses described as idiopathic or nonspecific will continue to decline. Advances in the widespread use of improved oral rehydration solutions have led to a decline in the morbidity and mortality associated with diarrhea. Future advances in preventive measures, including vaccines, may lead to a reduction of the incidence of diarrheal disease.",
