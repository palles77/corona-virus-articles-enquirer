Several members of the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) family have been shown to play critical roles in cancer progression, however, the expression or function of the TTSP Human Airway Trypsin-like protease (HAT) in carcinogenesis has not been examined. In the present study we aimed to determine the expression of HAT during squamous cell carcinogenesis. HAT transcript is present in several tissues containing stratified squamous epithelium and decreased expression is observed in carcinomas. We determined that HAT protein is consistently expressed on the cell surface in suprabasal/apical layers of squamous cells in healthy cervical and esophageal epithelia. To assess whether HAT protein is differentially expressed in normal tissue versus tissue in different stages of carcinogenesis, we performed a comprehensive immunohistochemical analysis of HAT protein expression levels and localization in arrays of paraffin embedded human cervical and esophageal carcinomas compared to the corresponding normal tissue. We found that HAT protein is expressed in the non-proliferating, differentiated cellular strata and is lost during the dedifferentiation of epithelial cells, a hallmark of squamous cell carcinogenesis. Thus, HAT expression may potentially be useful as a marker for clinical grading and assessment of patient prognosis in squamous cell carcinomas.",

            "text": "The human TTSP family encompasses 17 known members in humans that all contain an Nterminal transmembrane domain, a C-terminal extracellular serine protease domain and a \"stem region\" that contain various types, combinations, and numbers of conserved domains. Human Airway Trypsin-like protease (HAT) has the simplest domain configuration, where the stem region contains a single sea urchin sperm protein, enteropeptidase, agrin (SEA) domain . HAT belongs to the HAT/DESC subfamily of TTSPs that comprises HAT (encoded by TMPRSS11D), DESC1 (encoded by TMPRSS11E), HAT-like 4 (encoded by TMPRSS11F), HAT-like 5 (encoded by TMPRSS11B), and TMPRSS11A (encoded by TMPRSS11A) . Human HAT protein was first isolated in 1997 from the sputum of patients with chronic airway diseases and cloned the following year from human trachea cDNA (Yasuoka et al., 1997; Yamaoka et al., 1998) . HAT is highly expressed in respiratory epithelium, where the protein localizes to the suprabasal layer of bronchial epithelium, as well as the basal region of their associated cilia. It has been proposed that HAT plays a role in mucus production (Takahashi et al., 2001; Chokki et al., 2004) . In addition, it has been demonstrated that HAT supports proteolytic activation of influenza A and B viruses and the SARS coronavirus in vitro. Therefore, HAT may play a role in activation and spread of different respiratory viruses in the human airways (B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al., 2010 Nygaard et al., 2011; Bertram et al., 2011; Baron et al., 2012) . The expression of HAT transcript has been identified in several additional tissues including tongue, skin, esophagus, and cervix (Sales et al., 2011) . While there has been an extensive body of literature documenting causal roles of TTSP members in carcinogenesis, including hepsin, and matriptase (List, 2009; Antalis et al., 2010; Szabo and Bugge, 2011) , HAT is one of the few family members that remains uncharacterized in cancer.",

As illustrated in Figure 1A , the Ab1 antibody was raised against the serine protease (SP) domain, whereas the Ab2 antibody was raised against the stem region containing the SEA domain. The specificity of the two antibodies was tested in HEK293T and HeLa cells transfected with full-length human HAT cDNA. Western blot analysis under non-reducing conditions revealed a single band at the predicted molecular weight (46 kDa) (Yamaoka et al., 1998) TTSP's are synthesized as inactive zymogens that are activated by cleavage at a conserved activation site motif (predicted to be between Arg 186 -Ile 187 in HAT, indicated with an arrow in Fig. 1A ). Upon activation, the catalytic domain remains tethered via a disulfide bond to the stem region of the protease. Therefore, the cleaved, active SP-domain can be visualized by SDS-PAGE and western blotting under reducing conditions using Ab1. As displayed in Figure 1C , the full-length form of HAT was detected in addition to a ~27 kDa form corresponding to the HAT SP-domain (Yasuoka et al., 1997) which was visible in both HEK293T and HeLa cells (left panels). Again, no cross-reactivity with HATL5 was detected. The V5 antibody readily detected HATL5 protein as expected (right panel). In conditioned media from HeLa cells (Fig. 1D ) and HEK293T cells (not shown), HAT was only detected as the 27 kDa form indicating that the majority of shed HAT is present in its active form.",

Interestingly, HAT mRNA is also expressed in several tissues containing squamous epithelia including skin, oral cavity, cervix, and esophagus (Sales et al., 2011) . This prompted us to examine the distribution and cellular localization of HAT protein in squamous epithelia by IHC. The two independent anti-HAT rabbit antibodies raised against different HAT peptide antigens (Ab1 and Ab2) verified above were used to minimize the risk of non-specific staining. Using serial sections, slides were probed with primary antibodies or used as negative controls where the primary antibody was substituted with non-immune rabbit IgG (Fig. 2D , G and data not shown). Representative sections of normal esophageal and cervical mucosa are shown in Figure 2 . Careful inspection of staining patterns on serial sections revealed that the two anti-HAT antibodies displayed very similar staining pattern of the tissues examined ( Fig. 2A, B, E, F) . In both the cervix and the esophagus, a strong epithelial staining was detected in the apical squamous cells with no significant staining in the submucosal or mesenchymal compartments. HAT protein is primarily localized on the cell surface of the larger squamous cells (Fig. 2C ) and no nuclear staining was observed. This cell surface localization is in agreement with the expected distribution of the predicted membrane anchored topology of HAT. No significant staining was detected in the basal layer. The basal layers harbor the highly mitotic cells in in squamous epithelia (Huang et al., 2005; Looi et al., 2008) . Sections from liver (Fig. 2H , I), thyroid (Fig. 2J ) and brain (Fig. 2K ), which have previously been shown to express no detectable HAT message by RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis (Yamaoka et al., 1998; Sales et al., 2011) , were included as negative controls. The insert in Fig. 2K demonstrates HAT staining in bronchial epithelium as previously reported (Bertram et al., 2011) . Taken together, these data demonstrate that endogenous HAT protein displays a pericellular localization in differentiating epithelial cells in stratified squamous epithelia.",

The esophageal tissue arrays were incubated with two different anti-HAT rabbit antibodies as described above (Fig. 3G , I, J, K and data not shown) and non-immune rabbit IgG as a negative control (Fig. 3H) . In terms of HAT expression, well-differentiated, low-grade carcinomas (Grade I) showed moderately intense and dispersed cytoplasmic staining, while moderately differentiated carcinoma (Grade II) showed weak cytoplasmic dispersed expression with no visible cell surface staining. Three grade II tumors displayed no visible staining. In poorly differentiated carcinoma (Grade III), HAT expression was absent in two of the six samples, whereas the rest displayed faint to moderate HAT expression (Fig. 4B) . Esophageal tissue arrays, incubated with non-immune rabbit IgG instead of HAT rabbit antibody, displayed no observable staining on the cell membranes, cytoplasm, or nucleus (Fig. 3M) . Statistical analysis and comparison showed a significant decrease in staining intensity in Grade I (P <0.02), Grade II (P <0.02), and Grade III (P <0.01) carcinomas in comparison to normal tissue (Fig. 4B ).",

            "text": "As part of an ongoing effort to determine the expression and function of the TTSP family in cancer, we performed expression analysis of HAT in healthy cervical and esophageal epithelia and in corresponding epithelia during squamous cell carcinogenesis. The specificity of the two HAT antibodies used in this study was verified by western blot analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis of HAT protein expression in human tissue arrays showed that the protease was consistently expressed in the suprabasal and apical layers harboring the most differentiated epithelial cells in healthy epithelia. The staining pattern in normal esophagus was consistent with that observed by Uhl\u00e9n et al. (2015) . Furthermore, HAT was mostly confined to the surface membrane of epithelial cells, consistent with the predicted localization of the type II transmembrane serine protease. Importantly, in squamous cell carcinomas of the same tissues, a significantly decreased expression and, in many cases, a complete loss of HAT was observed in advanced cancer. The localization of HAT protein in normal stratified squamous epithelia and the subsequent loss of the protease during carcinogenesis provide valuable information regarding the function of the protease in normal epithelial biology and carcinogenesis. In stratified squamous epithelia, a balance between cell proliferation, differentiation, and death must be carefully regulated in order to maintain their function. The stratified squamous epithelium acts as an effective barrier between the outside environments contaminants, including toxins and pathogens. The cells of these epithelia replicate frequently to replace damaged or dead cells. The proliferating epithelial cells reside in the basal layer and cells continuously pass through a complex differentiation program to generate basolateral and apical cells that are finally sloughed off (desquamation) at the surface of the epithelium. It has been demonstrated that extracellular proteases are involved in the acquisition of functional stratified squamous epithelia. Thus, the TTSPs, matriptase and TMPRSS13, are critical for terminal differentiation and proper function in the epidermis and oral epithelium (List et al., 2002 (List et al., , 2003 Madsen et al., 2014) . Considering the finding that HAT is expressed in the non-proliferating suprabasal/apical layers combined with the observation that HAT is lost during the dedifferentiation of epithelial cells in high grade tumors, a hallmark of squamous cell carcinogenesis, an interesting question to explore further is whether the observed link between loss of HAT protein and squamous cell carcinoma progression is correlational or causal. A recent study demonstrated that HAT deficient mice did not display any overt phenotypes in the absence of external challenges or additional genetic deficits (Sales et al., 2011) . However, it remains to be experimentally tested whether these mice have an altered susceptibility if subjected to e.g. chemical genotoxic stress or transgenic oncogene expression. Currently, the candidate endogenous mammalian proteolytic substrates identified for HAT include the urokinase receptor (uPAR), and the protease activated receptor (PAR) 2 (Iwakiri et al., 2004; Chokki et al., 2005; Matsushima et al., 2006; Beaufort et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2013) . In addition, HAT has fibrinolytic activity and it has been hypothesized that HAT may participate in fibrinolysis within the airway mucous membranes, by cleaving fibrinogen transported from the blood stream (Yoshinaga et al., 1998) . Interestingly, two other HAT/ DESC subfamily members, DESC1 and HATL5 display similar expression patterns in normal stratified squamous epithelium and a gradual loss during carcinogenesis. Thus, DESC1 expression correlates with normal keratinocyte differentiation and inversely with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma progression (Lang and Schuller, 2001; Sedghizadeh et al., 2006) . We have previously shown that HATL5 is significantly decreased in cervical, esophageal, and head and neck carcinomas as compared to normal tissue (Miller et al., 2014 ). An important finding in this connection is that cellular HAT is present in both its zymogen form and in its cleaved and active form and that shed HAT is present mainly in its active form upon transfection of full-length HAT cDNA in mammalian cells. Interestingly, the active forms of DESC1 or HATL5 were not detected in similar experiments (Hobson et al., 2004 , Miller et al., 2014 . Therefore it can be speculated that HAT acts as an activator and initiator of a proteolytic cascade during terminal differentiation of squamous epithelia similar to the proteolytic cascade of tissue kallikreins in the stratum corneum of the epidermis (Brattsand et al., 2005) .",

(B) In esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, a significant decrease in staining intensity was observed between normal tissues versus; grades I (P <0.02), normal versus II (P <0.02), and normal versus III (P <0.01), respectively. Together, these data indicate a gradual loss of HAT expression during tumor progression in two types of squamous cell carcinoma. DUHAIME et al.Page 16",
