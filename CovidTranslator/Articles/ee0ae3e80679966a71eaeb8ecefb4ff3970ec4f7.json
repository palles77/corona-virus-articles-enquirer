The interaction of N protein with viral RNA was investigated using circular dichroism and surface plasmon resonance. N protein underwent a conformational change upon binding viral RNA and the data indicated electrostatic interactions were involved in the binding of the protein to RNA. Kinetic analysis suggested the amino-terminal region facilitates long-range non-specific interactions between N protein and viral RNA, thus bringing the RNA into close proximity to N protein allowing specific contacts to form via a 'lure' and 'lock' mechanism.",

            "text": "Positive stranded RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells and encode viral RNA binding proteins. Coronaviruses are no exception and synthesise an RNA binding protein termed the nucleocapsid (N) protein which is one of the most abundantly expressed viral proteins in an infected cell [1] . This protein has multiple functions in the virus life cycle both in terms of interacting with viral RNA [2] [3] [4] and modulating host cell processes [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . The replication of the coronavirus genome is complex and involves the direct replication of the genomic RNA (approximately 30 kb in length) and transcription of multiple subgenomic mRNAs via a discontinuous mechanism [11] . The positive sense genome comprises of a coding region flanked by untranslated regions. The 5 0 end consists of a short leader sequence and the 3 0 end is polyadenylated, both features are shared by the subgenomic mRNAs. N protein also associates with components of the viral replicase (an RNA dependent RNA polymerase) [12] and as such can be viewed as being crucial in the recruitment of viral RNA for replication. Certainly, N protein is required for the efficient rescue of coronavirus full length clones (e.g. [13] [14] [15] ) and has direct roles in the regulation of viral RNA synthesis [16, 17] . Kinetic studies utilizing equilibrium reactions and investigation of dynamic interactions (using surface plasmon resonance (SPR)) indicated that the N protein has particular affinity for the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) [2, 18] . This short nucleotide sequence is found within the viral leader sequence and also precedes each open reading frame. Mutation of specific nucleotides within and around the TRS can alter RNA transcription [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

Recent studies have hypothesised that the amino-terminal region of N protein has the potential to form an electrostatic interaction with RNA [24] and disruption of this interaction has been proposed to be a target for anti-viral therapy [23] .

The HIV-1 NCp7 Gag polyprotein cleavage product can promote strand annealing by inducing electrostatic interactions between strands [28] , and the nucleocapsid (NC) protein binds to RNA with high affinity (K d = 94-315 nM) via electrostatic interactions [29] . Likewise the binding of southern cowpea mosaic virus coat protein R domain to viral is mediated by electrostatic interactions and the R domain changed conformation upon binding RNA [30] . In order to investigate the role of the amino-terminal region of IBV N protein and full-length protein in binding viral RNA, SPR and circular dichroism (CD) were used to determine the strength and specificity of RNA/protein interactions, and to investigate whether any structural changes occurred.",

To assess the effects of increased salt in the buffer the binding kinetics of IBV N for leader RNA were analysed at 150, 300 and 500 mM NaCl. The resulting sensograms (Fig. 3B) show that the addition of 300 mM salt decreased the overall binding affinity of N protein to RNA (11 nM). Although unlike the amino-terminal region there is a large proportion of full length protein retained on the RNA at the end of the dissociation period (Fig. 3B ) (dissociation rate 0.012 1/s). This data suggests that interactions are stronger between full length N protein and RNA than those of the amino-terminal region.

In which the addition of salt to the SPR buffer resulted in an increase, and subsequent decrease at higher salt concentrations, of association rate. A plot of log of the association rate (k ass ) versus log[NaCl] (Fig. 3C ) has a 'bell shape' distribution often observed for a sliding mechanism [40] . This occurs when the protein ''slides'' along the nucleic acid in a one-dimensional non-sequence specific manner, mediated by electrostatic attractions, until it meets its target sequence or structure to which it can bind specifically. In the case of N protein and viral RNA this target sequence could be the TRS.

There was no significant difference in the CD spectra between these concentrations and therefore 0.4 mg/ml of the amino-terminal protein was used in subsequent experiments. This protein was analysed in the absence and presence of leader RNA with a molar ratio of 1:1, in six independent experiments (representative CD spectra is presented in Fig. 4B ). Leader RNA alone was analysed by CD at these wavelengths and no adsorption was observed (data not shown). Secondary structure content for each spectra was calculated using DICHROWEB [42] which utilises a series of algorithms to provide calculated secondary structure content and allows direct comparison of cal- culated structures and experimental data (Table 1 ). This analysis of the real time solution structure of the amino-terminal region of IBV N protein suggested a large proportion of bsheet, turns and random coils, which is in close agreement with the solid state crystal structure [24] . There was no significant difference in this solution structure of the amino-terminus with and without viral RNA, suggesting that no gross conformational change occurs. In contrast, CD analysis of the binding of the leader RNA to N protein resulted in a conformational change of the protein (Fig. 5 ) indicated by the change in the CD profile between the presence and absence of RNA. For example, DICHROWEB revealed that the percentage of a-helix changed from 21% to 16% in the presence of leader RNA. The data suggests changes in the secondary structure of N protein are required to accommodate the viral RNA.",

However, little is known about the underlying mechanism and kinetics of this interaction. SPR analysis allowed the monitoring of the formation of complexes in real-time and provided simultaneous equilibrium and kinetic information [43] . The dynamic nature of protein:RNA interactions may be a key feature in the regulation of a number of biological mechanisms. The rate of binding and release may influence processes such as the ordered assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes (encapsidation of viral RNA), movement of RNA:protein complexes between sub-cellular compartments and competition for binding sites. Elucidation of the partial crystal structure of N protein revealed that conserved basic amino acids in this region lie within close proximity to form a positively charged cluster [9, 23, 24] . The resulting data indicated that electrostatic interactions, most likely between this basic cluster and the negative phosphodiester backbone of RNA, play a central role in binding. However, other bonds may important in the stabilisation of N protein with viral RNA.",

This brings the full-length protein within close proximity to the RNA, and may facilitate sliding, until specific interactions form between viral RNA (perhaps mediated via the TRS) and N protein (forming a 'lock' step). We postulate N protein may locate its target TRS and other high affinity binding sites via a sliding mechanism.

The average values and standard deviations of the six experiments are shown in bold face.
