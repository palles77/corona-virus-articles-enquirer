Signal sequences have been found at the amino-terminal end of precursors for secretory and transmembrane proteins. In many cases they are cleaved during their translocation across the membrane by a specific protease (signal peptidase). Signal sequences are quite variable in length, ranging from 16 to more than 50 amino acid residues (von Heijne, 1983) . They all have a central core of hydrophobic amino acid residues, and most of them have a positively charged amino-terminal segment (von Heijne, 1985) . Signal sequences on nascent polypeptides are recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP), a ribonucleoprotein complex that mediates the interaction with the membrane by the selective binding to docking protein (or SRP receptor) (Walter et al., 1981b; Meyer et al., 1982; Gilmore et al., 1982) .",

Those spanning the membrane once have either the carboxyl terminus (type I membrane proteins) or the amino terminus (type II membrane proteins) exposed on the cytoplasmic side. Membrane insertion of type I membrane proteins most likely proceeds in a manner very similar to that of secretory proteins (Lingappa et al., 1978) . Type I membrane proteins are usually synthesized with a cleavable signal sequence and, in contrast to secretory proteins, are held in the membrane by a \"stop transfer\" sequence. Examples of type I membrane proteins are the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein and class I and class II histocompatibility antigens (Lingappa et al., 1978; Dobberstein et al., 1979) .",

The neuraminidase of influenzavirus (60s et al., 1984) , the invariant chain (Ii or ly) of class II histocompatibility antigens (Claesson et al., 1983; Strubin et al., 1984; Long, 1985; Lipp and Dobberstein, 1986) , the transferrin receptor (Schneider et al., 1984) , and the asialoglycoprotein receptor (Chiacchia and Drickamer, 1984; Holland et al., 1984; Spiess and Lodish, 1986 ) all belong to this class of membrane proteins. Some steps in their membrane insertion must be similar to that of secretory and type I membrane proteins, as an SRP-and docking protein-dependent membrane insertion has been demonstrated for some of them (Spiess and Lodish, 1986; Lipp and Dobberstein, 1986) . Membrane insertion might occur in a loop-like fashion as this scheme can most easily explain how the different membrane topologies of membrane proteins are achieved (Engelman and Steitz, 1981) . As type II membrane proteins contain only a single stretch of hydrophobic amino acid residues, this might function as a signal for membrane insertion as well as a membrane anchor (Markoff et al., 1984; Spiess and Lodish, 1986) . To identify and characterize this sequence, we tested membrane insertion of the human invariant chain (ly) and several deletion and fusion proteins derived from it in a cell-free membrane insertion system. ly is a typical type II membrane protein (Claesson et al., 1983; Strubin et al., 1984; Lipp and Dobberstein, 1986) . It exposes 30 amino-terminal residues on the cytoplasmic side, spans the membrane between residues 30 and 60, and exposes a large carboxy-terminal domain on the exoplasmic side. This domain has two sites for the addition of N-linked carbohydrate units. Membrane insertion of ly requires SRP and docking protein (Lipp and Dobberstein, 1986) . As the amino-terminal, cytoplasmic domain is hydrophilic and shows no resemblance to a signal sequence, it has been proposed that the membrane-spanning region, or part of it, functions as an internal, uncleavable signal sequence (Dobberstein et al., 1983; Claesson et al., 1983; Lipp and Dobberstein, 1986) .",

When transcription is performed in the presence of the cap analog 7mGpppA, the resulting mRNA can be translated efficiently in eukaryotic cell-free systems. We have observed, however, that a stretch of GC residues at the 5' end of a cDNA negatively affects expression of the resulting RNA (unpublished observation). The ly cDNA construct (py-2) had been GC tailed and was inserted into the Pstl site of pBR322 (Claesson et al., 1983) . We deleted the 5' GC tail and cloned ly cDNA, or part of it, into the polylinker site of pDS5 or p6/5R (see Experimental Procedures for details). ply contains the entire l-y coding region behind the T5 promoter ( Figure 1 ). plycat is an in-frame fusion between the 5' region of ly encoding the cytoplas, mic, membrane-spanning segment plus 12 amino acids of the exoplasmic portion of ly and the gene encoding the cytoplasmic protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). The CAT protein contains one potential site for the addition of N-linked oligosaccharide 36 amino acid residues downstream of its original initiator methionine. In AN-IyCAT, the entire hydrophilic, cytoplasmic segment from ly was deleted. The new initiator methionine is provided by the vector and is located in front of the hydrophobic segment.",

This is the expected molecular weight for nonglycosylated ly (Claesson et al., 1983) . When rough microsomes (RM), derived from dog pancreas, were added to the translation system, a higher molecular weight species of 33 kd appeared. This increase of 6 kd in molecular weight is consistent with the addition of two oligosaccharides to the two N-glycosylation sites. The 33 kd form ly* was reduced in molecular weight by about 2 kd when proteinase K was used to remove the cytoplasmically exposed domain (Figure 2 , lanes 2 and 3). When protease digestion was performed in the presence of the detergent NP 40, ly' was digested. These data suggest that ly' is integrated into the membrane and exposes 20-30 amino acid residues on the cytoplasmic side and a 30 kd domain on the exoplasmic side of the membrane. The identity of ly and its glycosylated form was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies raised against the amino-terminal 72 (anti-IyN) or against the carboxy-terminal 144 (anti-IyC) residues of ly. As shown in Figure 2 , lanes 5, 6, 8, and 9, these antibodies recognize glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms of ly. No protein could be precipitated with anti-IyN antibody when the cytoplasmic domain was removed from membrane-integrated ly' by protease digestion (Figure 2, lane 7) . As the antibody is directed against the amino-terminal portion of ly, the data directly demonstrate that the amino terminus is located on the cytoplasmic side and is accessible to the protease. With anti-IyC antibody, the processed form of ly is readily detectable, demonstrating an exoplasmic location of the carboxy-terminal portion of ly ( Figure 2 , lane 10).",

The size of IyCAT synthesized in the presence of RM and acceptor peptide was indistinguishable from that made in the absence of RM. When proteinase K was used to digest its cytoplasmically exposed domain, the size was reduced by about 2-3 kd ( Figure 5A ). We can conclude that nonglycosylated IyCAT synthesized in the presence of RM and acceptor peptide is inserted into the membrane in the same way as its glycosylated form and that no signal sequence is cleaved during membrane translocation ( Figure 5A Figure 58, lanes 2 and 3) . AN-IyCAT'was also found to be protected against exogenous proteinase K ( Figure 56, lane 4) . This suggested to us that the larger form was glycosylated and proteolytically processed and that AN-IyCAT' was generated by a proteolytic cleavage, most likely by signal peptidase.",

In the segment cleaved from AN-I$AT, threonine, a small neutral amino acid, is found at the -1 position, and leucine, an uncharged amino acid, at the -3 position. Both of these residues fulfill the above described criteria for a signal peptidase cleavage site.

As in many secretory proteins, the cleavage site for signal peptidase is surrounded on either side by 1 or even 2 charged amino acid residues. It is reasonable to assume that the active center of this enzyme is located close to the exoplasmic side of the ER membrane, not within the membrane. We propose that the removal of the cytoplasmic, hydrophilic segment from IyCAT allows the hydrophobic segment to shift its position within the ER membrane. Most likely it positions itself more toward the exoplasmic side. Hence, a potential signal peptidase cleavage site becomes accessible to the active center of signal peptidase (see Figure 8B ).",

In both types of membrane proteins these regions comprise a stretch of 20 to 30 hydrophobic amino acid residues that is flanked on the cytoplasmic side by positively charged amino acid residues. In type I membrane proteins the segment spanning the membrane does not appear to participate in the initial stage of membrane insertion. Type I membrane proteins usually have cleavable signal sequences that initiate the membrane translocation of the amino-terminal half of the protein. The membrane-spanning region, in its position close to the carboxy-terminal end, seems only to function in anchoring the protein in the membrane. Yost et al. placed the membrane-spanning segment of the murine surface immunoglobulin heavy chain close to the amino-terminal end of a fusion protein (Yost et al., 1983) . In this position the segment did not provide the signal function for membrane insertion. As, however, a hydrophilic segment of about 40 amino acid residues precedes the membrane-spanning segment, the question still remains as to whether a membrane-spanning region from a type I membrane protein, when placed into the appropriate surrounding, can also initiate translocation across the ER membrane. It is well conceivable that certain hydrophilic sequences preceding a hydrophobic segment play a crucial role in exposing a potential signal for membrane insertion. Up to now no special structural features, besides hydrophobicity, are known to be crucial for the function of a signal sequence.",

This was based largely on the finding that both of these types of proteins require SRP and docking protein for their membrane insertion. Here, we show that a type II membrane protein can be converted into a secretory protein by removal of the cytoplasmic segment. This directly demonstrates that the signal for membrane insertion of these two types of proteins can be the same. Further deletion into the carboxy-terminal half of the ly hydrophobic segment is required to elucidate whether the cleaved signal sequence contains all the information for membrane insertion. It is conceivable that the functional signal sequence extends over the cleaved signal sequence into the adjacent hydrophobic part. For some secretory protein it has been observed that the cleavable signal sequence is not sufficient for membrane insertion. In the case of staphylococcal protein A, sequences of the amino-terminal part of the mature protein are required for membrane insertion and correct processing (Abrahmsen et al., 1985) .",

These domains are then inserted into the ER membrane by a yet unknown mechanism. As the amino terminus of a type II membrane protein has to remain on the cytoplasmic side, the formation of a loop during membrane insertion has been proposed. In the case of a secretory protein, signal peptidase would be able to act as soon as the loop appears on the exoplasmic side. An initial interaction of basic residues in a signal sequence with the phosphates of the membrane lipids was originally proposed by lnouye for the lipoprotein of E. coli (Inouye et al., 1977) . Our results rule out an essential role of these basic residues in ER membrane insertion. The AN-IyCAT protein does not contain any charged amino acid residues preceding the hydrophobic segment. It is nevertheless translocated across the ER membrane and processed.",

Von Heijne points out that the type of amino acids at the -1 and -3 position in front of the site of cleavage are im-portant in assigning a cleavage site. Here we show that sequences at the very beginning of a signal sequence can also influence cleavage by signal peptidase. In the case of ly, these charged residues can prevent cleavage by signal peptidase. The variability in the length and in the amount of charged amino acid residues at the amino terminus of asignal sequence has not as yet been explained. Mutation and deletion experiments have clearly shown that charged residues are not essential for membrane insertion. In the light of our findings, we propose that the charged amino acids at the amino terminus of signal sequences function in the alignment of signal sequences in the ER membrane such that signal peptidase can cleave at a very specific site with high fidelity. Our prediction is that removal of charged residues from the amino-terminal end of the signal sequences can lead to an altered or less specific signal peptidase cleavage. Wheat germ was obtained from General Mills, California. The acceptor peptide benzoyl-Asn-LeuThr-N-methylamide was a generous gift from E. Bause, Cologne.",
