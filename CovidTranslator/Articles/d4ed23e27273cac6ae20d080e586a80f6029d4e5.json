The twice cloned cell line secreted bovine IgG~ subclass antibody. Ascites fluid was prepared in pristane treated nu/nu mice by intraperitoneal injection. The pooled ascites fluid was purified by affinity chromatography and the functions of the antibody assessed in various serological tests. The BM-8 antibody did not agglutinate well at a neutral pH, however, under acid conditions it was efficient at agglutinating B. abortus cells. The antibody did not precipitate B. abortus LPS in double agar gel immunodiffusion but was very active in the direct complement fixation test and the indirect enzyme immunoassay, although it was unable to compete with a murine monoclonal antibody in a competitive enzyme immunoassay.",

These reagents are valuable in immunochemical studies and some cell lines were reported to secrete products that reacted with Streptococcus sp. or Staphylococcus sp. thus furnishing tools for antigen-antibody interaction studies with bovine immunoglobulins. Similarly, mouse X bovine hybrids have been developed which produce antibody to the K99 pilus ofE. coli (Anderson et al., 1987) or to the bovine enteric coronavirus (Raybould et al., 1985) .

The BM-8 antibody was capable of fixing guinea pig complement. In the diagnostic CFT, 200 ng/ml of the antibody gave 50% activation of three CHso units of complement (Fig. 4) . Similarly, in the diagnostic indirect ELISA, using B. abortus LPS as the antigen and mouse monoclonal antibody to bovine IgG1, conjugated with HRPO, as the detection reagent, 25 ng/ml of BM-8 could be detected after 10 min of development at an OD of 1.0 at 414 nm.

It is notable that, in spite of a high hybridization rate (approximately 60% of the wells contained growing hybrid cells), only one fusion product produced antibody of the desired specificity. This may reflect a lack of specific B-cells in the peripheral blood at a particular time, in spite of high levels of serum antibody. Thus the immunization schedule in relation to the time of bleeding for lymphocyte harvest is of importance. This is unlike the mouse system in which normally the spleen is used as a source of lymphocytes. Alternate approaches would be to biopsy lymph nodes that drain the immunization site (Tucker et al., 1984; Anderson et al., 1987) or spleen cells (Srikumaran et al., 1983a,b) . Cell line stability with interspecies-fusion partners may be a problem as the murine chromosomes are lost and as a result immunoglobulin secretion ceases or diminishes with culture time. In the case of BM-8 this has not been a problem. The cell line appears stable in culture and several subcultures stored in liquid nitrogen prior to propagation have produced immunoglobulin in quantities comparable to the parent cell line. Production of ascitic fluid in large volumes alleviates some of the long term culture problems. An alternate approach to enhance stability of immunoglobulin production might be to re-fuse the hybridoma cell line with bovine lymph node cells obtained from immunized animals (Tucker et al., 1984 ) .",

This reagent could be valuable as a source for continuous quality control and standardization inherent to mass serological testing. In the past, individual sera or pools have been relied on as positive reagents in diagnostic serology, but in spite of large volumes on hand, these reagents eventually run out, necessitating the need for others which were never identical. An added problem has been the inability of laboratories to compare data to the lack of uniformity of reagents. The BM-8 monoclonal antibody could provide such a reagent for the CFT and ELISA. It is of interest to note that the BM-8 antibody fixes guinea pig complement as efficiently as does polyclonal affinity purified IgG1 (Fig. 4 ) ; however, it is considerably more active in the indirect ELISA than polyclonal IgG1 (Fig. 5) .",

This discriminatory assay which uses the O-chain of B. abortus LPS as the antigen, appears to be based on at least three premises: (1) the antibody response of infected cattle differing from that of $19 vaccinated cattle; $19 vaccinated animals lack antibody to the 'length' epitope of the O-chain while infected cattle develop antibody specific for both the 'tip' and the 'length' epitopes; (2) that the antibody affinity of vaccinated cattle is less than that of infected cattle and (3) that the antigen presented on the polystyrene 96-well plate has the 'tip' epitope occluded {Nielsen et al., 1988) . The BM-8 antibody, derived from an immunized rather than infected animal would appear to lack specificity for the 'tip' determinant of B. abortus O-chain or perhaps a determinant not recognized by the murine monoclonal antibody.
