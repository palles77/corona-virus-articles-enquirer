In this review, we discuss the applicability of this technology to helminth infection research, including strategies of co-culture of helminths or their products with organoids and the challenges, advantages, and drawbacks of the use of organoids for these studies. We also explore how complementing organoid systems with other cell types and components may allow more complex models to be generated in the future to further investigate helminth-host interactions.",

            "text": "Helminth infections affect millions of people and livestock, resulting in a major social and economic burden worldwide [7, 8] . Despite their impact, research into helminth infections relies heavily on the use of animals and is limited by a lack of models that more closely reproduce the interaction of the parasites with their specific hosts [9] . In vivo model organisms for human and livestock helminth infection have provided invaluable data on the immune response to helminths, parasite genetics, and transmission. Nevertheless, these models are expensive and complex, hindering the study of hostparasite interactions at the molecular level. Moreover, model organisms cannot fully recapitulate human helminth infections. Entirely new systems are therefore needed that allow the processes of invasion and colonization of human helminths to be studied, and that open up new possibilities for testing new drug targets and identifying vaccine candidates. Organoids from different organs infected by helminths during their life cycle (including gut, lung, bladder, and liver) have enormous potential as novel models for studying the interactions of helminths and their products with their hosts. Nevertheless, the size and complexity of helminths pose challenges on the adaptability of organoid cultures for their use in research. Here, we discuss the applicability of this technology. From our recent investigations into the interactions of whipworm larvae with caecal epithelium and evaluations of the host response to excretory/secretory (ES) products (see Glossary), we explore the advantages and pitfalls of using organoid systems.",

In recent years, organoids have started to be exploited as a tool to indirectly investigate the effects on the intestinal epithelia of the immune responses triggered by intestinal helminth infections. Specifically, mouse small intestinal organoids have served as an experimental system to demonstrate the expansion of tuft cells as a consequence of ex vivo stimulation with interleukin (IL) 13. IL-13 is secreted by innate lymphoid cells in response to stimulation with IL-25, a cytokine produced by tuft cells during the early response to in vivo infection with the intestinal dwelling nematodes Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, Heligmosomoides polygyrus, and Trichinella spiralis [36] [37] [38] [39] . These findings Glossary Excretory/secretory (ES) products: soluble mediators released by helminths, either actively exported through secretory pathways or diffused or leaked from the parasite soma as a consequence of physiological process such as digestion. ES products may interact with host tissues and are involved in parasite invasion and modulation of host immune responses. Extracellular matrix (ECM): 3D network of extracellular hydrated macromolecules, such as collagen and glycoproteins, present within all tissues and organs. ECM provides essential physical scaffolding for cells, together with the biochemical and biomechanical support required for tissue morphogenesis, differentiation, and homeostasis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs): lipid bilayer-enclosed nanoparticles released by cells and carrying complex cargoes, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids involved in intercellular, interorganismal, and even interspecies communication.",

Moreover, organoids can be grown in a 2D and 3D conformation, and, in contrast to traditional cell lines, they retain organ specificity and maintain genome stability, allowing their biobanking [2, 6] . These features make them amenable to high-throughput screening, although it is important to consider that Pericytes: mural cells of the vasculature that wrap around the endothelial cells that line the capillaries, arterioles and venules throughout the body. Permeable support/transwell: cell culture device, also known as cell culture inserts, composed of a porous membrane which hangs in the centre of an outer well and provides independent access to both sides of a monolayer. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs): stem cells with the capacity to differentiate into any type of cell of all three germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm. They include both embryonic and induced PSCs. Embryonic PSCs are derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst of an earlystage preimplantation embryo. Induced PSCs refer to those derived from adult somatic cells that are reprogrammed to an embryonic stem-cell-like state. Primary tissue stem cells: stem cells present in organs from adult organisms and with the capacity to divide and differentiate into the different cell types present in the organ of origin.

Tuft cells: chemosensory cells with blunt apical microvilli, found in the thymus and hollow organs or tubes lined by an epithelium such as the urinary tract, the digestive and respiratory systems. experiments using organoids are currently subject to variability due to inherent heterogeneity in size, shape, structural organization and functional capacity, and batch variability of both the ECM and growth factors used in culture [3, 16, 53] .",

            "text": "The multicellular composition of organoids is critical for studying the varying roles of specific cell types in colonization, replication, transmission, host damage, and clearance of pathogens. These studies are not achievable with cell lines that often present only one or two types of cells present in the organ of interest [6] . Moreover, 'wild-type' organoids can be genome-edited using lentiviral expression systems or CRISPR/Cas9, a process that, in animal models, requires embryo mutagenesis and breeding. An additional advantage of organoids is that they can be generated from patientderived stem cells, allowing the long-term impact of pathogen infections on histological features and physiological phenotypes to be studied. The use of organoids in experiments with live helminth parasites requires careful consideration of the different components of the in vivo host-parasite interaction that this system can potentially recreate ( Figure 1 , Key Figure) [3] . Those include specific host molecular structures sensed by helminths that are defined by tissue architecture, polarization, and multicellularity; environmental clues such as the presence of commensal microbiota, gas exchange, and nutrient gradients; and physiologically relevant biomechanical forces (e.g., fluid shear, stretch, compression) [3, 6] . In addition, it is crucial to consider the life cycle stage of the parasite to be used in organoid studies as this impacts the mechanistic and physiological experimental conditions to be used. Next, we discuss our own insights on the use of intestinal organoids to model host-helminth interactions.",

Sizes range from a few hundred micrometers in the eggs and infective stages (L1/L3 larvae, cercariae) up to meters in the adults of some cestodes. Thus, a combination of parasite size and organoid dimensional conformation determines the extent to which the co-culture/infection can be controlled, both in terms of the number of parasites and concentration of ES products, as well as the conditions required for potential hatching of eggs, or activation of larvae/adults and their invasion (such as oxygen levels, presence of host molecular structures, cellular polarization/architecture, and microbiota). For pathogens other than helminths, there are no reports on the impact of the dimensional conformation and architecture of organoids on the interactions with the host cells. Indeed, the life cycle of the protozoan parasite C. parvum can be replicated both in 3D and 2D organoids [33, 34] .",

Basal-out 3D organoids have restricted luminal access, thus requiring delivery of parasites or their products directly into the lumen of organoids by microinjection. Microinjection is technically challenging, slow, and laborintensive [3] . This technique poses problems with delivery depending on organoid size, as the number of cells per organoid and luminal volumes vary, making it difficult to perform precise quantitative experiments [3, 5, 6] . The volume injected also depends on the accumulation of mucus and cell debris within the enclosed organoid lumen, which restricts access to the apical surface of the epithelia [56] . In addition, microinjection can result in spillage of the cargo into the basolateral space that can lead to confounding results [56] .",

In our experience, microinjection is viable for ES products and larvae only (eggs and adults are too large), and is not amenable to high-throughput approaches because larvae often block the microinjecting needle. Upon microinjection of the parasites, it is important to consider the luminal conditions in the organoid, as low levels of oxygen (varying from approximately 3-10% [60] ) and accumulation of dead cells can impact parasite ability to survive and invade ( Figure 1 ).",

An additional advantage of this system is the better oxygenation of the culture, compared with 3D organoids where the low concentrations of oxygen in the lumen may be detrimental to parasite viability. Moreover, permeable supports/transwells permit access to the basolateral compartment, so that growth factor or nutrient gradients can be established, and other cells can be co-cultured, such as immune cells, to better reproduce the native microenvironment. Unfortunately, a current major limitation of this system is that live imaging of the transwells is currently not possible without disassembling the permeable support [56] .",

Moreover, upon successful infection of both 2D and 3D organoids by helminth larvae, it is implausible that these systems can support moulting of parasites to reach adult stage; the time interval for moulting exceeds the 48-72 h interval for splitting organoid cultures required for their culture maintenance.

Co-culture with immune cells includes: (i) intraepithelial lymphocytes that proliferate and incorporate in the organoid epithelium [71] ; (ii) macrophages that enhance barrier function and maturity of enteroid monolayers and respond to infections with E. coli [72] ; (iii) lamina propria lymphocytes that mediate commensal protection of the epithelium [73] ; and (iv) dendritic cells that alter stem cell fate by inhibiting secretory lineage and drive absorptive lineage [74] . The anaerobic nature of the majority of the members of the intestinal microbiota complicates its co-culture in 2D organoid systems that grow under normal oxygen concentrations [5, 75] . However, introduction of some oxygen-tolerant microbiota members (and their components and by-products), in organoid cultures and other intestinal models, has allowed their influence on the intestinal SCN to be studied [62, 73, 75] .",

Importantly, interacting molecules at the host-helminth interface will provide good candidates for novel antiparasitic interventions such as vaccine development or targets for drug discovery -and the organoid system provides an experimental set-up suitable for screening approaches. Drug discovery not only includes those to treat helminth infections, but also medicaments that target chronic noninfectious diseases resulting from a dysregulated immune system, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), for which alternative therapies with helminth-derived compounds are currently being developed [43, 76] .",
