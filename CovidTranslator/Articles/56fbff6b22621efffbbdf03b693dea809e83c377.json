However, this requires that the validity and reliability of the data be evaluated for the purpose for which they are to be used. This manuscript reports an evaluation of milk shipment data for evaluating their usefulness in disease monitoring and the resilience of organic and conventional dairy herds in Sweden. A large number of inconsistencies were observed in the data, necessitating substantial efforts to \"clean\" the data. Given that the selection of rules used in the cleaning process was subjective in nature, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine if different cleaning routines produced substantially different results. Despite the cleaning efforts we observed far more large residuals at the shipment level than expected. Thus, it was concluded that the data were too \"noisy\" to be used for identification of short term impacts on milk production.",

The effects on residual variance of organic status or whether or not the herd used an automatic milking system were evaluated in models in which the residual variance was stratified or not by these factors. We did not find consistent evidence to suggest that organic herds had higher resilience than conventional herds, but this could be partly due to using residual variance as the measure indicating resilience.

Milk recording is based on individual cow measurements taken, usually, monthly. An alternative, potential source of information on milk production and milk composition is the milk shipment data, which has the benefit of being recorded frequently, i.e. at each bulk tank milk shipment, usually every one or two days. Milk shipment data are, however, aggregated on a herd level and have therefore less detail. Because most serious diseases afflicting dairy cattle affect milk production (W\u00fcthrich et al., 2016; Cumming et al., 2005; Charfeddine and P\u00e9rez-Cabal, 2017; Toftaker et al., 2017) , these regularly collected milk production data have potential for use in research and for disease surveillance through monitoring of fluctuations in production. Milk shipment data have previously been used for research purposes (Toftaker et al., 2017) , but a thorough evaluation of the usefulness of the data source still is needed.",

            "text": "The concept of resilience in ecological systems was first described by the Canadian ecologist Holling (1973) and describes the capacity of an ecosystem to tolerate disturbance without collapsing into a qualitatively different state that is controlled by a different set of processes. A resilient ecosystem can withstand shocks and rebuild itself when necessary. In modern literature, resilience is defined as the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and re-organize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity and feedbacks (Folke, 2006) . Elgersma et al., 2018; D\u00f6ring et al. (2014) suggest that there are different definitions of resilience but distinguish three steps that all covered in almost all definitions: disturbance, response and outcome. In dairy production resilience can be defined as the capacity to cope with disease and other production disturbances, a concept akin to general adaption (Elgersma et al., 2018; D\u00f6ring et al., 2014; Elgersma et al., 2018) . Health, as stated by the IFOAM principles of organic agriculture, is the wholeness and integrity of living systems. It is not simply the absence of illness, but the maintenance of physical, mental, social and ecological well-being. Immunity, resilience and regeneration are key characteristics of health (IFOAM, 2018) . Organic philosophy implies that natural behaviour, optimal feed and low stress levels are disease preventing factors and that they also lead to better resilience. Thus, it can be hypothesised that organic dairy herds would have less severe, or shorter duration of infections or other diseases/ disturbances.",

The sampling frame was all dairy herds with an average herd size of at least 50 cows and enrolled in the Swedish Official Milk Recording Scheme. Geographically, all Swedish counties except for the most southern (Sk\u00e5ne) were included. Sk\u00e5ne was excluded because it was known that there are very few Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus or Bovine Corona Virus negative herds in that region. Organic herds were defined as herds with KRAV-certified dairy production (www.krav.se). KRAV is the major Swedish certification body for organic production. In Sweden all farms have grazing systems according to legal requirements. The main Swedish breeds are Swedish Red and Swedish Holstein, where the yearly average milk yield in 2017 was 9156 kg and 10,274 kg, respectively (Veldhuis et al., 2016; V\u00e4xa Sverige, 2018) . All dairy companies have individual rules on bulk milk somatic cell counts for premium payments and for rejection of deliverance of milk. A simple random sample of 400 conventional and all eligible organic herds (n = 244) were sent a written invitation to the study in May 2011. The number of invited herds was based on previous experiences of about 30% willingness among Swedish dairy farmers to participate in similar observational studies. In total, 69 (17%) and 75 (31%) farmers with conventional and organic herds, respectively, agreed to participate in the project. However, only 93 herds (54 organic and 39 conventional) had all of the required milk shipment and milk size data and were included in the analyses. In 27 out of 93 herds the milking system changed from conventional milking systems to AMS during the study period.",

Moreover, tie stalls practicing regular milking times, could be hypothesized to have the same number of milkings between deliveries whereas the number of milkings in AMSherds most likely have a larger variation between subsequent milk deliveries.

Hence, in line with the findings of Folke, 2006; Felleki et al. (2012) we concluded that, also when evaluating milk production, attention needs to be paid to factors which influence the variance as well as the fixed effects in the model. Further, the model fit was improved by using an exponential correlation structure compared to the more commonly used AR1 correlation structure, but the demand for computational power was high with a 40-fold increase in time required to fit a model. The results from the sensitivity analyses showed that the shipping-day variance did not change substantially whether we used the stricter or more liberal cleaning procedures. A limitation in the analysis was that the 27 herds that transitioned from non-AMS to AMS during the study period were treated as separate herds before and after the transition as they were too few to add another level to the random structure in the model. Nonetheless, given the small number of conversion herds they were not likely to have had much impact on the variance estimation.",

Previously a variety of longevity measures have been evaluated as they reflect all functional traits (Fall et al., 2008; Ahlman et al., 2011) . The ability to adapt to disturbances, resilience, is different, but a rather interesting approach. Few attempts have, however, been done to evaluate resilience in dairy production. ResilienceIt is challenging to identify a suitable measure of resilience, but in line with Elgersma et al. (2018) , the underlying thought behind the present approach was that disturbances would affect milk production volume less in the more resilient herds, in our case organically managed herds. For a complex dynamic system, such as milk production, it is hard to separate a genuine response to a specific disturbance from fluctuations in functionality of the system and the approach needs to be system specific and may involve a degree of subjectivity (Cumming et al., 2005; Elgersma et al., 2018; D\u00f6ring et al., 2014) . In the present study, one can argue that the development of rules for identification of erroneous production changes, is such a subjective component although tested by sensitivity analyses. Well aware of the shortcomings in the quality of data and the choice of measure of resilience in the present study, we could not find any support for our hypothesis, as the variance of daily milk volume per cow did not differ consistently between production system, across various data cleaning procedures, stratification strategies or models built.",

It would provide an opportunity to detect and possibly mitigate the consequences of disease outbreaks at herd and regional levels at an early stage. The possibilities of syndromic surveilance in order to detect viral diseases such as Bluetongue and Schmallenberg in dairy herds has previously been described using milk recording data (Madouasse et al., 2013; Veldhuis et al., 2016) , while milk robot data has been used for early detection of mastitis (Huybrechts et al., 2014) , but to the knowledge of the authors exploring the possibilities of milk delivery data has not yet been done. Early detection of outbreaks with endemic viruses, such as Bovine respiratory syncytial virus and Bovine Corona virus, would be desirable in order to reduce the impact of, and to control disease outbreaks. However, despite thorough cleaning, the milk shipment data were rather noisy and not likely to be useful for such disease outbreak detection. Table 4 Final linear regression model evaluating the effect of selected factors on milk shipped per cow per day, based on data set cln20, with the lowest level variance stratified by both AMS and organic and imposing an exponential correlation structure on the lowest level residuals.
