The units of analysis in these models are pairs of individuals at risk of transmission. The hazard of infectious contact from i to j consists of a baseline hazard multiplied by a relative risk function that can be a function of infectiousness covariates for i, susceptibliity covariates for j, and pairwise covariates. When who-infects-whom is observed, we derive a profile likelihood maximized over all possible baseline hazard functions that is similar to the Cox partial likelihood. When whoinfects-whom is not observed, we derive an EM algorithm to maximize the profile likelihood integrated over all possible combinations of who-infected-whom. This extends the most important class of regression models in survival analysis to infectious disease epidemiology. These methods can be implemented in standard statistical software, and they will be able to address important scientific questions about emerging infectious diseases with greater clarity, flexibility, and rigor than current statistical methods allow.",

            "text": "Infectious diseases are an important threat to human health and commerce, and understanding the transmission of disease is crucial to the design of public health interventions. The statistical analysis of infectious disease data is complicated by the fact that infections are inherently dependent, especially when they are transmitted directly from person to person (Becker, 1989; Andersson and Britton, 2000) . Epidemiologists have dealt with this problem in three ways. The most common approach is to model susceptibility to disease using standard statistical methods such as logistic or Cox regression, ignoring disease transmission. A second approach is to use chain binomial models (Rampey et al., 1992) , which estimate the probability of escaping infectious contact from infected members SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS Supplementary material available online at the Journal of the American Statistical Association website includes: of groups such as households, classrooms, or hospital wards. The third approach is to model the spread of disease as a branching process where infectees are the o spring of their infectors (Wallinga and Teunis, 2004; White and Pagano, 2008) . The time between the infections of an infector and an infectee is called a generation interval. In this approach, the generation intervals are assumed to be independent and identically distributed (iid).",

Regression models that ignore transmission cannot do this. When disease transmission is modeled as a branching process, uninfected people do not exist and cannot be exposed to infected people. The failure to account for uninfected person-time and competing risks of infection cause several problems with this approach (Svensson, 2007; Kenah et al., 2008) . The assumption that generation intervals are iid is di cult to relax, making estimation of covariate e ects di cult (Kenah, 2013) . Chain binomial models are a statistically sound response to the problem of dependence and can be used to estimate covariate e ects.

However, continuous-time models corrected for ties may o er a more flexible modeling framework. Kenah (2011) extended parametric methods from survival analysis to infectious disease data by modeling the contact interval. In the ordered pair ij, the contact interval \u03c4 ij is the time between the onset of infectiousness in i and the first infectious contact from i to j, where infectious contact is a contact sufficient to infect a susceptible individual. It is right-censored if the infectious period of i ends before i makes infectious contact with j or if j is infected by someone other than i. These methods solve the problem of dependence by treating ordered pairs of individuals, not the individuals themselves, as the units of analysis. Kenah (2013) showed that the contact interval distribution could be estimated nonparametrically by adapting the Nelson-Aalen estimator from standard survival analysis. These methods assume a homogeneous population where the contact interval distribution is the same for all pairs ij in which transmission from i to j is possible. They are unable to estimate covariate e ects on transmission, which is a primary goal of vaccine trials, outbreak investigations, and many other studies of infectious disease.",

When a given susceptible j is infected, all pairs ij are censored. If there were many pairs but few susceptibles, each susceptible would be exposed to a very high hazard of infection and most pairs would be censored very quickly. To take an extreme case, imagine a single susceptible exposed to m infecteds. The number of pairs at risk of transmission is m but the susceptible will be infected almost immediately when m is large.

We also recorded the \u03b1 and \u03b3 of the baseline hazard function and the number of EM iterations. Figure 3 shows good agreement between the estimated and true \u03b2 inf , \u03b2 sus , and \u03b2 pair for both (who-infects-whom observed) and (who-infects-whom unobserved). Table 1 shows excellent 95% confidence interval coverage probabilities for all combinations of baseline hazards and parameters. The estimates had slightly lower coverage probabilities than the estimates. The lower right panel of Figure 3 shows that this was achieved with relatively few iterations. The median number of iterations was 6, and 98% of simulations required \u2264 10 iterations. Only 2 out of 12000 simulations failed to converge within 25 iterations.

At low values of \u03c4, the hazard of infectious contact is very small, so almost all of the contact intervals will be censored. Since the percentiles are calculated for all censored and observed contact intervals, there may be too few observed intervals at the 10 th and 25th percentiles when \u03b1 = 2 for the large-sample normal approximation to be valid. Figure 6 shows the widths of the confidence intervals when who-infects-whom is not observed in terms of the width of the confidence interval when who-infects-whom is observed for \u03b2 inf , \u03b2 sus , \u03b2 pair , and \u039b 0 (\u03c4). For \u03b2 inf and \u03b2 pair , the precision gained by observing who-infects-whom is roughly equivalent to a 20-40% increase in sample size. The baseline hazard plays an important role in how much precision is gained, with a larger gain for \u03b1 = 0.5 than for \u03b2 = 2. There is no gain in precision for \u03b2 sus because observing who-infectswhom does not add to our knowledge of who was infected.

There are several important limitations of the analysis itself. With only 29 within-household transmissions, the largesample normal approximations may not hold and there is limited power to estimate the effects of age and antiviral prophylaxis. The age classification is crude, so it may not accurately capture the effects of age. The prophylaxis variable was missing for many pairs and was binary, allowing no consideration of the timing of prophylaxis relative to exposure. Analyses of the household transmission of influenza A(H3N2) found greater child-to-child than adult-to-adult transmission (Addy et al., 1991) . In our analysis of influenza A(H1N1), children appeared less infectious and more susceptible than adults, but these differences were not statistically significant. If not due to random noise, such a result could reflect a difference between the H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes of influenza A or a bias caused the failure to account for infection from outside the household. In any case, this analysis shows that the model needs to be extended to model infection from outside the household and to handle missing data.",
