As the shape of the scanning window used in these methods is circular or elliptic, they cannot find irregularly shaped clusters, say clusters occurring along river valleys or in cases where disease transmission is linked to the road network. In this study, we propose a more flexible geometric structure to be used as a spatial or spatio-temporal scanning window. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the scanning window to determine disease clusters. We evaluated the proposed method over a number of spatial and spatio-temporal datasets (Breast cancer mortality in Northeastern US 1988-1992 and different types of cancer in New Mexico 1982 -2007 . Experimental results demonstrate that the introduced approach surpasses the results produced by the circular and elliptic scan statistics in terms of efficiency, especially when dealing with irregularly shaped clusters.",

Thus, this class of methods is designed to detect clusters of disease in space and/or time [7] . Scan statistics originally developed by Naus [3] is used for temporal clustering to test whether the number of disease cases in a temporal subset, exceed the expectation given a null hypothesis of no outbreak. Kulldorff [8] developed a spatial scan statistics to test geographical clusters and identify their approximate location. In this method, many circular windows with different centers and radii are checked to detect clusters, where the number of disease cases inside the cluster is maximized, while the number of disease cases outside the cluster is minimized. The spatial scan statistics is not suitable to detect spatio-temporal clusters. This method does not consider the time component and it cannot detect recently emerging clusters. To address this problem, Kulldorff [9] extended the spatial scan statistics to spatio-temporal scan statistics, which can be used to detect recent emerging (viz. alive) clusters. In this method, cylindrical search areas are used where, the spatial search area is quantified by a radius of the cylinder, and the temporal search area is defined by its height. Moreover Kulldorff et al. [10] proposed an elliptic version of the spatial scan statistics by using an elliptic scanning window of variable location, shape (eccentricity), angle, and size. This method is more efficient to find non-circular (narrow) shaped clusters. The idea has been implemented as a software package SaTScan [11] , which is widely used as an efficient outbreak detection system.",

In this study, we propose a more flexible geometric structure that can be used as an efficient scanner window to find irregular shaped clusters in spatial and spatio-temporal domains. More specifically, we build upon a generalization of a circular shape, which is divided into a certain number of sectors where each sector comes with its own radius. To take advantage of the significant flexibility introduced in this manner, the scanner windows need to be optimized. Given the nature of the optimization problem arising in this way, we consider the use of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) being regarded as a flexible population-based optimization tool [12] .",

            "text": "It is instructive to take a quick look at the methods used in forming clusters of irregular geometry, especially those exploiting mechanisms of Evolutionary Computing. Duczmal and Assun\u00e7\u00e3o, [13] used simulated annealing to find spatial clusters with irregular shapes. In this method, the regions of the studied map are considered as the nodes of a graph so that the adjacent regions are connected in the graph. Then the problem is converted to finding a connected sub-graph with maximum likelihood ratio. The idea of graph representation of the map, has gained a lot of attention among other researchers. Along with wellrecognized advantages, the proposed method comes with some shortcoming. First, it usually finds peculiar (very irregular) shapes. Second, finding a medium to large size sub-graph with maximum likelihood ratio is a computational intensive task. To address this problem, Duczmal et al. [14] proposed a genetic algorithm that uses a fast offspring generation and an efficient evolution to generate different connected sub-graphs. The authors used a penalty function to avoid finding peculiar clusters. Tango and Takahashi [15] used graph representation as well and proposed a new method to construct connected sub-graphs. They used a (k \u2212 1)-nearest neighbor approach to select adjacent nodes in graphs, which controls the irregularity of clusters in shapes. In [16] , Patil and Taillie used the notion of ''upper level set'' to reduce the size of scanning windows and proposed an ''upper level set scan statistics''. The authors did not discuss how to select the level and no comparison with the circular scan statistics is reported.",

In circular spatio-temporal scan statistics instead of a circular window located in two dimensions, a cylindrical window formed in three dimensions is used, where the spatial search area is defined by cylinder radius, and the temporal search area is defined by cylinder height. Since we are going to find ''alive'' clusters (prospective analysis), candidate cylinders are limited to those that start at any time during the study period and end at the current time period.

In each iteration/generation, the search for optimal position (solution) is performed by updating the particles' velocities and positions based on a predefined fitness function. The velocity of each particle is updated using two best positions, namely personal best position and neighborhood best position. The personal best position, pbest, is the best position the particle has visited and neighborhood best position, nbest, is the best position the particle and its neighbors have visited. Based on the size of the neighborhoods, two PSO algorithms can be developed. When all of the population size of the swarm is considered as the neighbor of a particle, nbest is called global best (gbest) and if the smaller neighborhoods are defined for each particle, nbest is called local best (lbest). Gbest uses the star neighborhood topology and lbest usually uses ring neighborhood topology. In this topology, each particle in the population is connected to its two immediate neighbors on the basis of particle indices as shown in Fig. 1 [28] . There are mainly two reasons why neighborhoods based on particle indices are preferred: It is computationally inexpensive, and helps the spread of information regarding good solutions to all particles [28] .",

The set of regions in the map that are inside each scanner, form a cluster. For each cluster the likelihood ratio can be calculated using (1) , and the cluster with the highest likelihood ratio is considered as the most likely cluster. In circular scan statistics all scanner windows with different locations and radii (and height for spatiotemporal scan statistics) should be checked. Also for elliptic scan statistics, all scanner windows with different location, radii, angle and eccentricity (and height for spatio-temporal scan statistics) should be investigated. Unlike circular shapes, the number of elliptic shapes can be very high. To cope with this problem, Kulldorff et al. [10] proposed that, checking only a little number of different eccentricities to cover different elliptic scanners is enough. Moreover based on the size of eccentricity, only a little small number of angles should be investigated.",

For the spatial scan statistics, two elements are needed to represent the centroid (location) of the scanner and m elements are required to represent the radius of sectors (m + 2 in totals). In addition, for the spatio-temporal scan statistics the height of the scanner should be considered too. Fig. 3 illustrates the structure of each particle in PSO algorithm to find spatio-temporal clusters. In this structure x_axis and y_axis can be any arbitrary x-y coordinates in the map, sector i represents the radius size of the ith sector which can be an integer between 0 and the distance between two farthest regions in the map. Time_len is an integer between 1 and the range of time length of the study period and is used for spatio-temporal clusters. In this paper, since we are going to find alive clusters (clusters that occurred recently), the time-len element represents the range [T -time_len, T ] where T is the current time.

The advantage of these methods is that we can make sure that the selected regions by the scanner are connected. In other words the selected regions are set of neighbors in the map.

This leads to finding less stable solutions quantified by the associated higher standard deviation. Moreover in some datasets, fewer sectors have higher standard deviations. The reason is that for these datasets, the corresponding scanner gets to local optima and therefore the PSO finds more variable solutions.

For each entry, the first number is the best result between 10 independent runs, the second is the average and the third is the standard deviation. As it can be seen, for the dataset Stomach, the likelihood ratios for different population rates are the same. The reason is that the cluster occurred in regions with low population. The situation for other datasets is different and with increasing the population rate, the likelihood ratio increases because the cluster occurred in higher population rates. For the mortality dataset, 30% of the population rate has the highest average, because the cluster has occurred in this rate, and since the problem search space for this rate is less than the problem search space for the 40% and 50% rates, PSO can detect the clusters with high fitness values in different runs without trapping into local optima.",

Increasing the irregularity of the clusters leads to higher values of the standard deviation. Fig. 6 shows the selected regions by the PSO (best solution obtained for 10 independent runs) based on different population rates for Prostate dataset. Notice that the county ''Bernalillo'' contains about 29% of the population of New Mexico in our dataset. We can see that the parameter ''selectable population at risk'' has an important effect on detected clusters and to find true clusters, this parameter at least should be set to the population of the county with maximum population in the map (e.g., 29% for New Mexico datasets).",

When the adjacent counties are selected in an irregular form using PSO, the optimal likelihood ratio of the selected regions can be in a different time period rather than the detected clusters using circular and elliptic methods. Notice that the likelihood ratio of a cluster at any time period is depend on the number of disease cases and the number of expected disease cases inside and outside cluster at that time period as discussed in (1). Moreover, in Table 5 we can see that usually the number of selected counties by the PSO is more than the number of selected counties in both, circular and elliptic methods. Since PSO can consider irregular shaped clusters using the proposed flexible structure, it is able to remove the counties with low disease rates from the cluster. Therefore it can add a number of other counties that have high disease rates one by one to the final cluster. As a result the likelihood ratio of the final cluster will be increased without including more than 50% of the total population. On the other hand, because of the shape restrictions in circular and elliptic scanners, the areas with low disease rates cannot be removed from the cluster. Furthermore in these methods, by adding counties with higher disease rates to the cluster, some other counties will be added to the cluster (due to the circular or elliptic shape of cluster) that can lead to decrease in the likelihood ratio in the final cluster, or it will contain more than 50% of the total population in the studied regions (which is not allowed to be considered).",

Also, to select locations in the map, one method is dividing the map into a n \u00d7 m grid, and to consider the centroid of blocks as the centroid of the circles.

By having a small number of sectors, the size of the problem search space could be reduced and this will facilitate the PSO search process. Then by increasing the number of sectors the quality of results can be improved.
