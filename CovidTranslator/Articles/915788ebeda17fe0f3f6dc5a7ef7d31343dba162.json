            "text": "The 5 0 -cap structure is a distinct feature of eukaryotic mRNAs and is important for RNA stability and protein translation by providing a molecular signature for the distinction of self or non-self mRNA. Eukaryotic viruses generally modify the 5 0 -end of their RNAs to mimic the cellular mRNA structure, thereby facilitating viral replication in host cells. However, the molecular organization and biochemical mechanisms of the viral capping apparatus typically differ from its cellular counterpart, which makes viral capping enzymes attractive targets for drug discovery. Our previous work showed that SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) non-structural protein 14 represents a structurally novel and unique guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) that is able to functionally complement yeast cellular N7-MTase. In the present study, we developed a yeast-based system for identifying and screening inhibitors against coronavirus N7-MTase using both 96-well and 384-well microtiter plates. The MTase inhibitors previously identified by in vitro biochemical assays were tested, and some, such as sinefungin, effectively suppressed N7-MTase in the yeast system. However, other compounds, such as ATA and AdoHcy, did not exert an inhibitory effect within a cellular context. These results validated the yeast assay system for inhibitor screening yet also demonstrated the difference between cell-based and in vitro biochemical assays. The yeast system was applied to the screening of 3000 natural product extracts, and three were observed to more potently inhibit the activity of coronavirus than human N7-MTase.",

The cap structure has several important biological roles, such as protecting mRNA from degradation by 5 0 -3 0 exoribonucleases (Schwer et al., 1998) and directing pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA export from the nucleus (Darnell, 1979) . In addition, the cap structure confers stability to mRNAs and ensures their efficient recognition by translation initiation factor 4F for translation (Filipowicz et al., 1976; Schibler and Perry, 1977) . In contrast, host and virus RNA molecules with unprotected 5 0 -ends are degraded in cytoplasmic compartments (Liu and Kiledjian, 2006) . Uncapped RNAs, such as nascent viral transcripts, may also be detected as ''non-self'' by the RNA sensors RIG-I, Mda-5, and IFIT in host cells (Abbas et al., 2013; Bowzard et al., 2013; Hornung et al., 2006; Zust et al., 2011) , triggering antiviral innate immune responses through the production of interferon or IFIT (interferon-induced protein)-mediated antiviral activity (Daffis et al., 2010; Nallagatla et al., 2008; Rehwinkel et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs), infect many species of animals, including humans, and cause acute or chronic respiratory diseases (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] , Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV] (de Groot et al., 2013; Zaki et al., 2012) , and infectious bronchitis virus [IBV] , enteric diseases (e.g., transmissible gastroenteritis virus [TGEV]), and central nervous system (CNS) diseases (murine hepatitis virus [MHV] ) (Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005) . CoVs are the largest RNA viruses, are enveloped, and contain a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome ranging from 27 to 31.5 kb in length. The genome of SARS-CoV contains 14 open reading frames (ORFs) (Snijder et al., 2003) and generates 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) produced by the autocatalytic processing of the polyprotein by 2 viral proteases (Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . CoVs replicate in the host cytoplasm and encode their own capping enzymes. Among the four capping enzymes involved in coronavirus m7GpppAm-cap formation, guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) was identified as nsp14 in our previous work using a yeast genetic system (Chen et al., 2009) , and 2 0 -O-methyltransferase (2 0 -O-MTase) is formed by nsp16 with nsp10 as a cofactor (Chang et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2011; Decroly et al., 2011; Lugari et al., 2010) . SARS-coronavirus nsp14 was previously characterized as a 3 0 -to 5 0 -exoribonuclease (ExoN) (Chen et al., 2007; Minskaia et al., 2006) , and the N7-MTase domain was mapped to the carboxy-terminal part of the protein (Chen et al., 2009) . Interestingly, the ExoN active site is dispensable, though the ExoN domain is required for N7-MTase activity. The combination of the two functional domains (Chen et al., 2009 (Chen et al., , 2013 , a unique feature among all N7-MTases, indicates that SARS-CoV N7-MTase is a novel form of RNA-processing enzyme and thus suggests it as an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs.",

In this system, the gene Abd1 encoding yeast N7-MTase is knocked out from the yeast genome and complemented by expression of Abd1 from a plasmid with a URA3 selective marker, resulting in yeast strain YBS40, whereas the exogenous N7-MTase is expressed from another plasmid with a Trp selective marker. The expression of a functional URA3 gene encoding orotine-5 0 -monophosphate decarboxylase results in the conversion of the nontoxic 5-FOA compound to toxic 5-flurouracil in yeast. In a medium containing 5-FOA, which counter-selects URA3-expressing cells, the yeast cells can grow normally only when the exogenous protein can replace the function of the cellular N7-MTase (Fig. 1A) . In this study, we confirmed that SARS-CoV and human N7-MTase could rescue the growth of yeast cells that were deficient in N7-MTase. We further tested whether this N7-MTase activity is universal for nsp14 from other coronaviruses. As shown in Fig. 1B , nsp14 from other coronaviruses, including TGEV (group 1), MHV (group 2a), SARS-CoV (group 2b), MERS-CoV (group 2c), and IBV (group 3), showed N7-MTase activity that was functional in vivo by complementing the endogenous yeast enzyme. These results indicate that N7-MTase is well conserved among different coronaviruses and that nsp14 appears to be a target for the development of a universal inhibitor against coronaviruses. We then generated three yeast strains that grew dependently on the N7-MTase activity from SARS-CoV (MT-SARS), humans (MT-human), and yeast (MT-yeast).",

The mRNA of MTyeast, which was transformed with pMceK294A vector as control, is similar with yeast train YBS40, because the mRNAs of yeast N7-MTases are transcribed from the complementary plasmids (URA3) bearing the yeast-MT. In the strains with MT-SARS and MT-human, the expression of yeast N7-MTase could not be detected (data not shown). As the expression of MT-SARS and MT-human is at the similar level, these yeast strains could be used to identify the inhibitors that inhibit SARS-CoV MTase more potently than human MTase. However, the mRNA levels of MT-SARS and MT-human are four times higher than that of MT-yeast, the latter being expressed from a low-copy-number plasmid with centromeric element (Cen), the inhibitory activity on SARS-CoV and yeast MTases cannot be directly compared.",

Individual colonies of MT-Yeast, MT-Human, and MT-SARS were cultured in a medium lacking tryptophan, and the pre-cultures were diluted with fresh medium to an A 595 = 0.01. A 100-ll aliquot of the culture was incubated in each well of two 96-well plates, one of which was used for measuring yeast propagation by spectrophotometry, whereas the other plate was used for the direct counting of the cell number. Measurements were performed at 4-h intervals over 48 h. As shown in Fig. 1D and E, all three yeast strains (MT-SARS, MT-human, and MT-yeast) showed similar growth curves within 48 h, indicating that both the SARS-CoV and human MTases could support the normal growth of yeast cells. At such a growth condition, starting with a liquid culture at A 595 = 0.01, the time period between 4 and 24 h corresponded to the logarithmic growth phase (Fig. 1D and E) . During this growth phase, the optical density (A 595 ) was well correlated with the cell number as demonstrated for the yeast strain MT-SARS by linear regression analysis (Fig. 1F ). In the linear regression equation, y = 8.60359x \u00c0 0.67266 (R 2 = 0.924, R 2 is regressive coefficient), it shows that there is a correlativity between the A 595 of culture liquid and cell number in the logarithmic phase (4-24 h) of MT-SARS when The least square method was used to evaluate the interrelationships between the two variables (X and Y), where X represents the spectrophotometric measurement (A 595 ) and Y represents the corresponding cell number in the logarithmic phase (4-24 h) of MT-SARS. The linear regression equation for the MT-SARS strain, y = 8.60359x \u00c0 0.67266 (R 2 = 0.924, R 2 is regressive coefficient), was obtained through normative analysis in least square method with Excel program. In this linear regression equation, there is a correlativity between the A 595 of culture liquid and cell number in the logarithmic phase (4-24 h) of MT-SARS when the R 2 > 0.9. the R 2 > 0.9. Similarly, there was also a high correlativity between the two optical absorbance and the cell number for strains MT-Yeast and MT-Human, with linear regression equations y = 8.379x \u00c0 1.0337 (R 2 = 0.926) and y = 8.514x \u00c0 0.6286 (R 2 = 0.922), respectively.

The yeast strains MT-Yeast, MT-Human, and MT-SARS were incubated with 100 lM of each compound, and the cell growth was measured at 4-h intervals over a 48-h period. Remarkably, sinefungin significantly repressed the growth of all three yeast strains (Fig. 3) , confirming the previous report of sinefungin as a potent inhibitor (Chrebet et al., 2005; Li et al., 2007; Pugh et al., 1978) . In contrast, ATA, AdoHcy, and ribavirin did not exhibit inhibitory activities against the three yeast strains. Because Ado-Hcy and ATA could inhibit the activity of coronavirus N7-MTase in biochemical assays, the results showed a clear difference between in vitro biochemical assays and in vivo cell-based assays, indicating that N7-MTase inhibitors identified using in vitro biochemical assays may not necessarily be effective within a cellular context. Such discrepancy may be attributed to the low membrane permeability to AdoHcy and ATA or that the IC 50 of AdoHcy and ATA are far greater than 100 lM. Indeed, sinefungin has been reported to be actively transported across yeast membranes, whilst AdoHcy and ATA are not (Zheng et al., 2006 (Zheng et al., , 2007 .",

As shown in Fig. 3 , sinefungin exhibited a similar inhibitory effect on all three yeast strains at high concentration (100 lM). However, stronger inhibitory effect on MT-Yeast was observed than that on MT-Human and the strains harboring the MTases of other coronaviruses at low concentration (0.1 lM) (Fig. 4A and B). This could be explained by intrinsic difference of inhibitory effect to different MTases or the difference of the expression levels of the MTases as we showed that higher mRNA levels of MT-Human and MTases of coronaviruses were expressed than that of MT-yeast (Fig. 1C) . To further characterize sinefungin as an MTase inhibitor in the yeast-based system, yeast strain YBS40, expressing different N7-MTases, was incubated with sinefungin at different concentration for 20 h (Fig. 4C and D) . The IC 50 (n = 3, mean values \u00b1 SD) of MT-Yeast, MT-Human and MTases of coronaviruses were calculated and shown in Table 1 . These results indicate that sinefungin is a broad-spectrum inhibitor against various species of N7-MTases, including those from yeasts, humans, and coronaviruses and demonstrate that the yeast-based system could be used for analysis of N7-MTase inhibitors. However, sinefungin is not an ideal antiviral inhibitor due to its lack of specificity on coronavirus N7-MTases compared to yeast and human MTases. Therefore, it is still necessary to screen for specific viral N7-MTases inhibitors, an effort that will benefit the functional study of viral MTases and clinical drug development.",

Twenty hours post-incubation, the cell density was monitored by measuring the optical density at A 595 . In the first round, the extracts that did not repress MT-Human were selected for further testing. The primary candidate extracts were tested twice for reproducibility and inhibitory effects using independent samples of each extract. In summary, we obtained three candidates extracts, PF35468 (natural product extract from a fungus species, preliminarily characterized as Penicillium spp.), PA48202 and PA48523 (natural product extracts from actinomycetes, preliminarily characterized as Streptomyces spp.), which could potently inhibit the growth of MT-SARS and MT-yeast but significantly less effectively inhibit MT-Human (Fig. 5) . The inhibition ratios of the 3 extracts on MT-SARS to MT-Human were 3.5, 3, and 9, respectively. In contrast, sinefungin suppressed the growth of all 3 yeast strains at a final concentration of 10 lM (3.81 lg/ml). The fungal and actinomyces natural product extracts used in this study were composed of complex ingredients, and these three extracts could be used for the isolation of the active ingredients in future work. Taken together, the yeast-based assay system could provide a platform for screening N7-MTase inhibitors that are more effective against viral MTases and less effective against human MTases.",

During the logarithmic growth phase (4-24 h), the optical density of the culture at A 595 was well correlated with the cell number ( Fig. 6A-C) . The following linear regression equation was established for the MT-SARS strain: y = 8.82419x \u00c0 0.12315 (R 2 = 0.992), indicating that they are more correlative in 384-well microtiter plates than 96-well microtiter plates (Fig. 6C) . To validate the yeast-based system for the highthroughput screening of inhibitors against N7-MTases, we performed a growth suppression assay and measured the IC 50 of sinefungin against the 6 yeast strains that had been tested in the 96-well format ( Fig. 6D and E) . The IC 50 values (n = 3, mean values \u00b1 SD) for sinefungin against MT-Yeast, MT-Human, MT-SARS, MT-MHV, MT-TGEV, and MT-IBV were 39.18 \u00b1 12.13 nM, 623 \u00b1 1.36 nM, 1621 \u00b1 2.14 nM, 1349 \u00b1 3.33 nM, 1398 \u00b1 1.34 nM, and 1430 \u00b1 4.87 nM, respectively (Table 1) , which were highly consistent with that of the 96-well microtiter plates (Figs. 4 and 6 and Table 1 ). These results indicate that the yeast-based high-throughput screening system could be used for the discovery of specific antiviral inhibitors.

As the yeast-based system developed in this study included three yeast strains carrying yeast, human, or coronavirus N7-MTase activity, this method could be used to screen and identify inhibitors that are specific against coronaviruses and not (or significantly less effective) to human N7-MTase. In addition, the structural and mechanistic differences among coronavirus, yeast, and human MTases also provide the rationale for developing specific inhibitors. Accordingly, we exploited these differences and screened over 3000 natural product extracts. Interestingly, three extracts showed more potent inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV and yeast N7-MTase than human N7-MTase (Fig. 5) .",

Therefore, the yeast cell-based system of this study was optimized for 384-well microtiter plates. In this system, the yeast cells grew well and did not sediment (Fig. 6) . Currently, only the AdoMet and AdoHcy backbones are used to synthesize analogs for the development of inhibitors that are specific for viral N7-MTases (Lim et al., 2011) . The high-throughput yeastbased platform makes it possible to screen a large number of natural product extracts. The yeast-based system can be further used to screen a chemically synthesized compound library. The compounds obtained from such screenings may contribute to the drug design and development needed for the control of coronaviruses. ",

In yeast strain YBS40, the chromosomal Abd1 locus encoding the yeast cap N7-MTase is deleted and the cell growth depends on the maintenance of plasmid p360-ABD1 (URA3) that harbors the Abd1 gene and URA3 selection marker. The yeast strain YBS40 was transformed with a TRP1 plasmid carrying the gene of coronavirus nsp14 or human N7-MTase and then placed under 5-FOA selection to counter-select for the URA3 plasmid. The yeast cells only grow when the foreign gene in the TRP1 plasmid can functionally complement the yeast Abd1 gene as the plasmid p360-ABD1 (URA3), which is toxic on 5-FOA medium, is lost during the counter-selection.(B) Yeast growth on 5-FOA medium after the replacement of Abd1 by human HCM1 and coronavirus nsp14 (TGEV-nsp14, MHV-nsp14, SARS-nsp14, MERS-nsp14, and IBV-nsp14), respectively. (C) Relative mRNA transcription levels of the N7-MTases of MT-SARS, MT-Human, MT-Yeast and YBS40. b-actin mRNAs were detected as internal control to show the equal amount of mRNAs used in real-time PCR. The mean values of three independent experiments are shown, and the standard deviations (SD) are indicated by error bars, SD. (D) Growth curve of yeast YBS40 transformed with pMceK294A (MT-Yeast), HCM1 (MT-Human), and SARS-CoV-nsp14 (MT-SARS) plotted by the spectrophotometric measurement of cell density. The strains were cultured in SD/ \u00c0 Trp medium in 96-microtiter plates at 30\u00b0C, and a spectrophotometer was used to measure A 595 at 4 hintervals over the course of 48 h. The mean values of three independent experiments are shown, and the standard deviations (SD) are indicated by error bars, SD. (E) Growth curve of the MT-Yeast, MT-Human, and MT-SARS yeast strains were plotted by directly counting the cell number. (F) Positive correlation of optical absorbance of cell culture and cell number during logarithmic growth phase.",
