Our nomogram predicted a total of 188.6358 points at a 19.0 % probability threshold, which was close to the prevalence of severe COVID-19 (14.8%) in the training cohort and hence consistent with the reality. This cut-off value may lead to a slight increase of false positive rates but in the setting of this COVID-19 outbreak, a little high false positive rates are acceptable in order to minimize risks of missed diagnosis. Meanwhile, application of the nomogram in the training cohort and validation cohort showed good differentiation with AUC values of 0.912 and 0.853 respectively, as well as high sensitivity and specificity.",
