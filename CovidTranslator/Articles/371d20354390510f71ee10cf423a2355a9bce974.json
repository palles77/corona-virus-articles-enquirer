Utilizing annual provincial panel data over the 2000-2005 period, the empirical results suggest that key determinants include the relative income, population in the original country, cost of travel, and tourism infrastructure. In addition, World Heritage Sites are also found to be significant in explaining the numbers of international tourists and have a greater touristenhancing effect. Other famous tourist sites rated 4A-and 3A-class are also attractive to foreign tourism. Moreover, cultural rather than natural sites attract more interest among foreign tourists, because China is internationally renowned for its long-standing historical and cultural assets. Finally, the importance of the determinants of the demand for tourism varies from country to country.",

            "text": "The tourism industry is now without doubt the largest industry in the world. In 2006, about 800 million international tourists expended some US$735 billion dollars. The World Tourism Organization (2000) predicts that international tourist arrivals worldwide will, by the year 2020, reach 1.6 billion persons and tourism receipts will exceed US$2 trillion. Moreover, the tourism industry has a strong linkage effect that benefits other service industries by creating jobs and earning foreign exchange. Meanwhile, the pollution produced by this industry is recognized to be lower compared to the manufacturing sector. Therefore, many countries have channeled greater efforts into developing their tourism industry in order to promote economic growth. 1 Indeed, income from tourism constitutes the largest 'export' and often exceeds onefourth of the GDP of many small developing countries. An increasingly large number of studies have been devoted to investigating the determinants of the demand for tourism, such as Naude and Saayman (2005) for Africa, Dhariwala (2005) for India, Dougan (2007) for Guam, Dritsakis (2004) for Greece, and Maloney and Montes Rojas (2005) for Caribbean destinations. 2 In the global tourism market, China is a latecomer. Before its ''open door policy'' was initiated in the late 1970s, China was closed to the outside world and cloaked in mystery. In 1986, China started to expand its tourism industry as part of its national plan for economic development by improving infrastructure and service facilities for international tourism. Benefiting from rich tour resources, such as numerous scenic spots and historical sites, long cultural traditions and colorful folk customs, China has subsequently attracted a huge number of international tourists every year since the early 1990s. 3 Its great potential in developing tourism has been evident in the rapid growth in the number of tourists, and foreign exchange earnings (see Table 1 ). 4 After the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, the number of international tourists experienced a steady upsurge in each year, except in 2003 when the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic prevailed in China. It increased from 10.484 million persons in 1990 to 49.913 million persons in 2006 and in terms of the corresponding ranking for international tourism China climbed from 11 to 4. Even in 2003 when SARS prevailed in China, the number of international tourists still amounted to 11.403 million persons. Since 2006, China has been ranked as the world's fourth largest tourism destination behind France, Spain, and the U.S., but ahead of Italy, thus reflecting the popularity of China in the global tourism market. In 2006, China accounted for 5.89 percent of the world total in terms of revenue from tourism. On the other hand, the international revenue from tourism increased more than 15 times from US$2.218 billion dollars in 1990 to US$33.949 billion dollars in 2006 and accounted for 1.272% of gross domestic product. While China has served as an important tourism destination in the global tourism market, the analysis of international tourism has attracted little attention among economists, suggesting the need for a systematic investigation.",

            "text": "To develop the tourism industry, the construction of infrastructure and service facilities are deemed to be essential inputs. The more important question is what can be done to attract international tourists and how? As suggested by Dritsakis (2004) , popular tour destinations have an a priori focus on tourism-related ''raw materials'' that refer to a combination of natural, cultural, and man-made elements that are closely related to the demand for tourism. These ''raw materials'' are unique to the tour destination and therefore cannot be transferred or reproduced in another location. Therefore, there is no doubt that a country with various kinds of travel spots, such as natural landscapes, historical sites, cultural traditions, or specific modern facilities, has a relative advantage when it comes to attracting tourists in the global tourism market. Among these factors, the scenic spots, which are inscribed on the list of World Heritage Sites (hereafter, WHSs) by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), are extremely attractive for global tourists. While the initial purpose in listing the World Heritages was to protect and maintain these tangible and intangible assets belonging to humankind, these scenic spots have been treated as the main tourism resources in many countries. In fact, heritages are regarded as a significant and rapidly growing factor in tourism and have been identified as a major driving force for further growth in many developed countries (Herbert, 2001; McIntosh & Prentice, 1999) . Moreover, heritage tourism can help develop a national image and produce a national identity (Li, Wu, & Cai, 2008) . 5 However, it is widely argued that a conflict between heritage protection and tourism development may exist. That is, are the WHSs being overloaded with tourists resulting in their gradual destruction? This question has elicited serious concerns among experts in various disciplines. Given the importance of this question, one essential issue is to clarify how and to what extent WHSs affect tourism. It is surprising that this important issue has been little explored.",

First, this paper is the first empirical study to investigate the determinants of tourists who visit China. Specifically, we place more emphasis on analyzing the influence of World Heritage Sites in terms of attracting tourists. By nature, the number of historical, natural and cultural sites is fixed over time, since they were established in the past. However, what changes is the label given by UNESCO after the Chinese authorities proposed the applications. The impact of such labeling recognition on tourism demand is an important topic especially for regional development. By utilizing a panel dataset, this study can provide preliminary evidence on whether the increase in the number of WHSs has really attracted more international tourist arrivals. 6 Secondly, by separating historical and cultural spots from natural landscapes and modern tourist spots in the estimates of the tourism demand equation, this study compares their potential differences in affecting the numbers of tourists among the various kinds of traveling spots. Third, we divide the entire list of sourcing countries into several sub-samples to examine the potential differences in their tourism behavior in China.",

            "text": "Convention of UNESCO in 1972 began to enact an international treaty called the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. The World Heritage mission is to encourage the identification, protection, and preservation of cultural and natural heritages around the world, which are considered to be of outstanding value to humanity. According to the heritage classifications defined by UNESCO, world heritages are classified into three categories: cultural, natural, and mixed (both cultural and natural) heritages. 7 The World Heritage Committee meets once a year and has the final say on whether a property is inscribed as a World Heritage Site. As shown in Table 2 , the number of sites inscribed by UNESCO has increased from 335 in 1990 to 851 in 2007. Benefiting from its long history and abundance of landscapes, China has many sites that are being inscribed on the list of WHSs. The number of sites in China included as WHSs has increased steadily from 7 in 1990 to 35 in 2007, ranking China in third place behind only Italy and Spain. Over that same period, the ratio of Chinese world heritages to the overall total has increased steadily from 2. 09% in 1990 to 4.11% in 2007. Although the list of world heritages aims to identify, recognize and protect those sites with global value, there are at least two advantages that inscribed world heritages have in terms of contributing to national tourism. First, the WHSs are widely used in marketing campaigns to promote national tourism. The marketing campaigns for WHSs can increase the global visibility of destinations and in that way attract huge numbers of international tourists. For example, in 1999, National Geographic Traveler showcased 50 of the world's top destinations or places that every curious traveler should visit in a lifetime. Among those destinations, except for recommended cities, most sites were listed as WHSs. This report seems to be regarded as a traveling Bible for international tourists and therefore has resulted in huge numbers of tourists visiting World Heritage Sites, and forming a wave of heritage tourists. Second, a developing or poor country perhaps lacks the economic, scientific, and technological resources to protect and maintain these heritages. Once sites are inscribed on the list of WHSs, UNESCO will provide financial as well as technological aid to repair and maintain those heritages, thereby helping the heritages to be preserved. These two advantages are quite important for developing countries and they are therefore aggressive in submitting famous sites in order to obtain a world heritage listing.",

This is in conflict with the initial goal of the World Heritage Convention, which was to protect and retain the sustainability of these sites. 8 To clarify this debate, the prerequisite is to assess the extent to which World Heritage Sites attract international tourists, and then information can be provided regarding the potential damage caused by the overloading of tourists.",

According to twelve criteria used to assign the corresponding points and sum up, 9 tourist spots are classified into four classes: 4A, 3A, 2A and 1A. The 4A-classification is the highest class, representing the spot within a province that is the most worth visiting. 10 By October 2000, the work of classifying and evaluating 215 4A-class tourist spot candidates in 31 provinces had proceeded smoothly. At first a group of 187 tourist areas (spots) won the honor of being regarded as 4A-classifications. The final list included 99 famous national historical and cultural cities, 750 national cultural sites under key protection, and 119 major scenic resorts and sites of historical and cultural interest. In the same year, 27 renowned scenic places were also inscribed on to the lists of world cultural and natural heritage sites. According to the rating standard, CNTA reviews the spots each year and accepts new applications to be registered as A-class spots. The distribution of spots included as A-class spots in 2001 is displayed in Table 3a and b.",

From the perspective of foreign travelers, due to the restrictions of time and travel budgets, 4A and 3A spots are more worth visiting than 2A and 1A spots. In actual fact, many of the 4A and 3A spots which are not inscribed on the list of WHSs are also internationally renowned for their value. For example, the Hunan Provincial Museum is classified as a 4A-class spot. However, the exhibition of excavations of Mawangdui tombs of the Western Han dynasty (about 193-110 B.C.) is one of the major archaeological discoveries of the twentieth century. Over 3000 cultural relics and a well-preserved female corpse are on display and millions of tourists visit that museum annually. Therefore, both 4A and 3A spots will be included in this study to examine their impacts on international tourist arrivals.",

The application of the gravity model to tourism demand is plausible because tourism is essentially a form of international trade (Eilat & Einav, 2004) in that the amount of tourist arrivals is heavily affected by both countries' characteristics and the transportation cost (distance). Therefore, the tourism version of the gravity model expresses the bilateral tourism flow as a function of the characteristics of the countries of origin and destination, distance (transportation cost), and factors that augment or distort tourist arrivals. Of course, the numbers of World Heritage Sites and A-class spots are the main variables of interest that might increase the number of tourists. By referring to the determinants considered in the existing literature and adopting the specification by indexing individual provinces of China as the destinations to examine international tourist arrivals from China's perspective, the starting point of the empirical model is specified as: Tianjin  0  0  0  0  0  0  Hebei  3  3  3  3  3  3  Shanxi  1  2  2  2  2 ",

Another important factor influencing the demand for international tourism is the exchange rate between the destination and sourcing countries. When a country's currency depreciates, it indicates its price level becomes lower compared to other countries and it can then attract more international tourism. We adopt the direct quotation method in this study, that is, exchange rate (EXCH) is denoted as the ratio of foreign currency to Chinese Yuan. A higher exchange rate indicates that the sourcing country's currency appreciates and there will be more tourists visiting China.

A certain volume of hotel rooms may be necessary to convince airlines to establish routes as well as to justify investment in complementary infrastructure such as roads (Naude & Saayman, 2005) . Therefore, the infrastructure constructed in each province (INFRA) is also included. It is measured by the sum of operated railways and roads in terms of kilometers. However, there is a potential causal relationship between infrastructure and tourist arrivals so that tourism demand leads to new transportation facilities; this variable therefore enters the equation in the form of a lagone period. The sufficiency of infrastructure should contribute positively to tourist arrivals. CRIME denotes the public security that is measured by the number of criminal cases defended per year. A region with a higher criminal rate usually reduces the willingness of international tourists to visit, while more tourists alternatively attract potential criminals to commit crimes. To reduce the problem of the simultaneous relationship between tourism and crime, the crime variable also enters the equation in the form of a lag-one period. Dhariwala (2005) and Dougan (2007) found political instability and civil war to have a negative impact on tourist arrivals. Thus, the estimated coefficient of public security is expected to be negative. The term HR is the proxy variable for sanitary conditions which is measured by the number of hospital beds.",

To compare the potential differences in tourist behavior across original countries, we need to collect data on the annual numbers of tourists based on their countries of origin in each province. However, the detailed statistical data concerning tourist statistics displayed in the ''Provincial Statistical Yearbook'' are not the same across provinces. Most provinces collect and display the data on international tourists according to the main countries of origin, while a few provinces show only the sum of international tourist arrivals. In order to obtain the largest dataset and the representative sample, we thoroughly checked the Statistical Yearbook of each province and finally selected tourist data for nine original countries in 26 provinces during the 2000-2005 period. Therefore, there are 234 observations (9 \u00c2 26) each year and a total of 1404 observations. As for the explanatory variables, except for the original countries' per capita GDP that is drawn from the databank of the World Bank, these variables are obtained from various issues of the statistical yearbooks of individual provinces. Moreover, since there is no annual number of hotels in the provincial statistical yearbooks, we therefore obtain this information from the website of a large Chinese travel agent. 15 The drawback of this data source is that it forces us to assume that the number of hotels in each province remained the same during the sampled period rather than providing the actual number of hotels in each year, although it is helpful to reduce the endogenous causality running from tourist arrivals to the number of hotels. The definition of and basic statistics for each variable are the averaged values during the ten years and are shown in the table in the Appendix.",

Moreover, the exchange rate plays an important role in affecting the tourism market in that the depreciation of the host country's currency relative to sourcing countries can attract more international tourist arrivals, ceteris paribus. The variable of geographical distance is found to be associated with a significantly negative coefficient for the pooling estimates, suggesting that, as transportation costs increase, international tourist arrivals will be reduced substantially, ceteris paribus. However, the coefficient of distance is not significant in the FE model due to the geographical distance between two countries being time invariant. Indeed, transportation costs are widely accepted to account for the largest share of the cost of an international journey. Given two destinations with similar tourism resources, the farther destination will be less attractive due to the higher transportation costs and longer flights. This situation has recently been particularly relevant to the international tourism market which has encountered serious problems due to the high price of petroleum. As for the impacts of regional characteristics, the estimated coefficients for lnACCOM and lnINFRA are both positive and significant at the 5% or 1% significance levels. This finding is consistent with previous studies in that infrastructure and sufficient accommodation facilities are essential inputs in developing and promoting the tourism industry. The coefficient for the public security variable in terms of crime frequency is positive but not significant, while this study has controlled for the possible endogeneity problem. This finding does not support the results obtained by Eilat and Einav (2004) and Naude and Saayman (2005) in that a country with a high crime rate delays the willingness of international tourists to visit. In fact, a region with more famous tourism sites may attract more tourist arrivals, while it also attracts potential criminals who will cluster together to seek potential victims. One alternative reason is that the destination country we observe is only one country and tourists may treat the conditions of public security as being similar across different regions in China. On the other hand, the ''health risk'' variable shows consistent results in the pooling estimates in that it is associated with a significantly positive coefficient as expected. This suggests that better public health is helpful in attracting international tourists. To sum up, the signs and significance of the above regional characteristics support the importance of the tourism infrastructure and related services.",

However, the positive but insignificant coefficient of WHS in the fixed-effects models suggests that the additional tourists brought on by inscribing existing famous sites in the WHSs lists seems to be limited. One point worth noting is that the geographical distribution of World Heritage Sites is concentrated mainly in four areas: Beijing, the Yellow River Basin, the Lower Yangtze River Basin, and Southwest China. 17 Given the fact that all provinces are visited by huge numbers of tourists but not all provinces possess World Heritage Sites, this implies that 3/4A-class spots actually play an important role in attracting tourist arrivals. More importantly, it is possible that the demand for 3/4A-class spots is a derived demand. If a traveler plans to visit China on only one occasion within a couple of years, she(he) may stay for at least several nights on that journey in China, implying that the journey perhaps includes several different provinces rather than being confined to one province. When tourists have finished visiting the targeted WHSs, they may continue to visit other 3/4A-class spots located in the same or in other provinces, implying that the combination of WHSs and 3/4Aclass spots might be considered together as they make the tourism decision. By adding the sum total of the WHSs and 3/4A-class spots as a new variable SITE, we find that estimates of models (5) and (6) show that scenic spots have the expected positive sign and that they exert a significant impact on international tourist arrivals.",

This implies that, by keeping other variables at their means, an increase in one World Heritage Site will induce about six times the amount of international tourist arrivals for a new 3/4A spot. From the standpoint of increasing international tourist arrivals and foreign exchange, it becomes apparent why each country is aggressive in submitting candidate spots to apply for the lists of World Heritage Sites. To be specific, the growth of China's domestic tourism has been very rapid since the late 1990s along with the economic development. In 2005, the number of international tourist arrivals was 46.809 million persons, while the number of domestic tourist arrivals reached 1121 million persons, which was nearly 26 times higher than that of international tourist arrivals.

One interesting finding is that there are different attitudes toward the crime issue and health risks between Asian and European (North American) tourists. As expected and as theoretically predicted, European and North American tourists have similar consumer behavioral traits in that they tend to be significantly concerned with the crime issue and health risks. The lnCRIME and lnHR variables have significantly negative and positive impacts on tourist arrivals, respectively. These findings suggest that, other things being equal, European and North American tourists favor visiting a province with a lower crime rate and better sanitary conditions. By contrast, the estimates for Asian tourists show that the coefficient of the crime variable is significantly positive in the fixed-effects model and the coefficient of sanitary conditions is insignificantly negative. We cannot, however, infer that Asian (Japanese and Singaporean) tourists prefer to take risks during their travels in China. A possible interpretation is that most Japanese and Singaporeans can read Chinese characters and look similar to Chinese, thereby enabling them to appear more confident and to have a better ability, compared with Western tourists, to deal with unexpected situations while they are in China.",

World Heritage Sites as opposed to 3/4A-class spots exhibit a significantly positive relationship with Asian tourist arrivals. By benefiting from the shorter geographical distance, tourists from Asian countries may visit China many times over a period of a couple of years. Asian tourists usually visit China by organizing a tour group and stay there only a few days. To be specific, the tour package offered focuses mainly on a few famous spots, especially WHSs. This tourism behavior therefore induces Asian tourists to focus on sightseeing at World Heritage Sites. Alternatively, both World Heritage Sites and 3/4A-class spots are relevant to European and North American tourists. The long Given the potential problems associated with aggregated data, the estimates for various kinds of World Heritage Sites show that historical and cultural sites consistently coincide with more tourist arrivals. When comparing European and North American tourists, this is particularly relevant for European countries which are mostly characterized by a cultural and artistic atmosphere and instill in their nationals a higher sense of appreciation for historical and cultural matters. The elasticity of cultural WHSs for European and North American countries is lower than that for Asian countries. One may argue that the similarities of culture and folk customs between China and Asian countries imply that the cultural WHSs should be less attractive to Asian tourists. In fact, the Chinese cultural tour organized for older people is very popular in Japan and Singapore, because many of the older generation in Singapore and Japan have specific ties to China. 18 Overall, this finding reveals that the universal value of cultural World Heritage Sites has received a high level of attention throughout the world. Compared with the unique and irreplaceable historical and cultural assets, the natural landscapes in China seem to be less appreciated by international tourists. The estimated coefficient of WHS-NAT is significantly positive only in European countries. Both cultural and natural World Heritage Sites are intangible assets belonging to all of humankind and they should be strictly protected to secure their sustainability regardless of their significance in promoting the development of international tourism.",

The empirical results show that the core variables of relative income, the population of countries of origin, and geographical distance enter as important factors in foreign tourism. Specifically, the transportation cost represented by distance is the key determinant of tourist arrivals in China, resulting in the fact that most international tourists visiting China come from its Asian neighbors. As for the regional characteristics, tourism infrastructure in terms of roads, railways, and star-level hotels is an important consideration for tourists from all continents. The effects of public order and sanitary conditions are less relevant for tourists.",

While modern facilities are found to be less relevant to attracting foreign visitors in China, they are, however, important for countries without an abundance of tourism resources related to cultural and natural heritage. To promote the tourism industry, there are many strategies available to the authorities, such as holding sports events, holding specific festivals, and developing tourism facilities, and so on. One limitation that should be emphasized is that the sample countries we select are highincome countries, implying that the above arguments may not apply to all international tourist arrivals in China.",

The tourist sites rated 4A and 3A by the Chinese authorities appear to be constant and the recognition of WHSs (Table 3a and b) is also roughly constant (there is only one smooth change in 6 out of 31 provinces) throughout the period we study. Therefore, the empirical estimates cannot separate the part of tourism demand that is due to the province's fixed effect from that which is due to the label effect, thereby preventing us from identifying the influence of the labeling policy on tourism demand. Our findings suggest that this important issue to do with labeling policy is worth further investigating. ",
