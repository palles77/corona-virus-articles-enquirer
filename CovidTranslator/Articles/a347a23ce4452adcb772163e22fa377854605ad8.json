Although it is unable to go through lytic infection of cells independently, it can do so in the presence of a separate infection by adenovirus or herpes simplex virus. In the absence of a helper infection by one of these viruses, the adeno-associated virus establishes a latent infection of the host cell by integrating itself into the host genome. About 70% of the integrations of the wild-type virus occur at a single site on chromosome 19 (Samulski et al., 1991) . Because these integrations do not seem to be associated with any disease, this virus may eventually be used to add therapeutic genes to the human genome with a lower risk of insertional mutagenesis. To date, however, the targeted nature of the insertional events is not retained when the native viral genome is replaced by a therapeutic or marker gene.

In the normal course of an infection, HSV-I will enter neuronal cells and remain latent, sometimes for years, before reactivating and starting a lytic cycle that results in a small patch of endothelial cell death (e.g., a cold sore). During latency, the host cell transcribes some viral genes, producing what are termed latency associated transcripts (LATs). HSV-I deletion mutants have been isolated that are incapable of reactivation, and that once inserted into a neuron will remain latent indefinitely. If therapeutic genes added to these vectors have LAT promoter elements, they will be expressed even though the virus itself remains latent. These vectors are being developed for the introduction of genes into cells of the central nervous system (Geller, 1993) .",

Although this may be a drawback in some cases where expression of the therapeutic gene must be restricted to specific cells, it may be possible to limit unwanted expression of the inserted gene by the use of tissue-specific promoters. All viral vectors for human gene therapy are derived from organisms that cause human disease. The possibility of reactivation of the vectors' infectivity or pathogenicity is hard to dismiss. In the end, it may prove easier and safer to construct a gene therapy vector having the elements of a successful virus, but derived from completely synthetic components.

Liposomes are generally classified by the number of bilayers (lamellae) they contain, by size, and by the composition of their membrane. The earliest liposomes were formed by hydration of a dried lipid film, followed by vortexing. This results in a cloudy solution of liposomes having many lamellar layers, resembling an onion. These are called multilamellar vesicles, or MLVs. Although MLVs are effective for the packaging of lipophilic drugs, they have very little aqueous volume in their interiors, and are not efficient at entrapping water-soluble compounds or large DNA fragments. Because of these deficiencies, MLVs were quickly superseded by unilamellar vesicles, which have only a single lipid bilayer between the external fluid and the lumen. Several methods are used to pre~pare unilamellar vesicles, each having its own advantages and disadvantages. Because of space limitations, we will only briefly describe those methods of liposome preparation that are directly relevant to the construction of gene therapy vectors.

Dialysis of these detergent mixtures results in the production of liposomes that are often called virosomes to indicate the presence of viral proteins. If the dialysis is performed properly, the fusion proteins of many viruses can be reconstituted in an active conformation (White et al., 1983) . Viral fusion proteins having a variety of different characteristics have been identified. For example, some are only active at low pH and fuse with endosomal membranes, while others are active at physiological pH and fuse to the plasma membrane. Some viral fusion proteins, such as the HA protein of influenza, bind to specific receptors before fusion. A few viral fusion proteins will only promote fusion to target membranes containing a specific mixture of phospholipids (Cervin and Anderson, 1991; Nussbaum et al., 1992) .",

These are resolved into liposomes by vortexing the paste. Encapsulation efficiency is high (up to 40 or 50%) because there is only a small amount of aqueous buffer present in relation to the amount of lipid. Presumably, DNA molecules present in the buffer are forced to curl up in small aqueous droplets, a conformation that is easily entrapped (Szelei and Duda, 1989) .

Advantages of this technique are: (i) nearly any lipid or lipid mixture can be used, (ii) liposome size from 25 to 100 nm in diameter can be controlled, and (iii) the encapsulation efficiency is excellent (up to 30%).

At the same time, the method would be sufficiently flexible with regard to size and vesicle composition to allow targeting of liposomes based on these properties. DNA in solution has a linear conformation. In general, DNA restriction fragments containing an entire gene are much longer than the diameter of com-monly used liposomes. It should not be surprising then that most methods of liposome formation entrap DNA only at low efficiency, and that the efficiency is inversely related to the length of the DNA (Fraley et al., 1980) . Two methods of increasing the entrapment efficiency of DNA have been developed. In the first, the liposomes are formed in such a way that the aqueous phase, containing the DNA, is broken into droplets small enough such that the DNA is forced to curl in upon itself to remain within the droplet. This probably occurs during REV formation. The other method achieves the same result by complexing the DNA with some substance in a tight and compact aggregate. To date, this has been done with spermine (Tikchonenko et al., 1988) and basic proteins (Jay and Gilbert, 1987) . The efficiency of encapsulation can also be increased by compacting the DNA in phage head particles (Szelei and Duda, 1989) before liposomal entrapment.",

First, they seek to make the liposomes as small as possible. This seems to reduce their interaction with the RES. Second, they are designed to make the liposomal surface as much like the surface of a normal cell as possible. This can be accomplished by using lipid formulations containing a high fraction of cholesterol, high transition temperature phospholipids, and a substantial fraction of sphingomyelin or the ganglioside GM 1. A different approach has been to modify the liposomal phospholipids by addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the polar headgroup (Lasic et al., 1991; Blume and Cevc, 1993) . PEG-modified lipids have a higher hydrophilicity than native lipids, and appear to escape recognition by macrophages. A potential disadvantage of this approach is that targeting of liposomes with covalently attached antibodies (see below) is inhibited by the presence of PEG-modified lipids (Klibanov et al., 1991) .",

By limiting the sites of DNA delivery, the chance of insertional mutagenesis is lowered. Second, limiting the number of cells that are transfected reduces the amount of DNA, lipid, and other proteins needed to perform the gene therapy.

            "text": "There are three general methods by which liposomes may be directed to a subset of cells within an organism. First, the liposomes may be introduced into a compartment of the body that is sequestered from the general circulation. One example of this is the addition of liposomes to the airway in a fluid or an aerosol (Hazinski et al., 1991; Stribling et al., 1992) . Because liposomes cannot cross the lung epithelial barrier, entrance into the general circulation is prevented. Therefore, it is anticipated that liposome vectors will transfect only those cells present on the epithelial surface. Another site where this approach may be applicable is in the central nervous system (CNS). In the cerebral vasculature, blood is separated from the CNS by the blood-brain barrier, which would normally be completely impermeable to any liposomes. However, if the cerebral vasculature is isolated, and perfused with a hyperosmotic solution, the blood-brain barrier is damaged, leaving holes large enough to admit liposomes into the CNS (Johansson, 1992) . The blood-brain barrier reconstitutes itself shortly thereafter, leaving the liposomes trapped within the CNS and unable to interact with any other cells. May not be specific enough Second, the lipid composition of the vesicles can be adjusted to cause them to be taken up preferentially by some types of cells. For example, macrophages have a very high affinity for liposomes containing (PS) on their surface (Lee et al., 1992) . Consequently, liposomes containing a substantial fraction of PS are quickly cleared from the circulation by macrophages (Allen et al., 1989) . A similar targeting strategy uses lactosylceramide as a membrane component. This lipid binds to the asialoglycoprotein receptors found on hepatocytes, causing these cells to be preferentially targeted by the vesicles (Grosse et al., 1984) .",

When DNA-loaded liposomes are added to cells they are endocytosed, and most are carried to lysosomes where they are degraded by digestive enzymes. Somehow, a small fraction of encapsulated DNA escapes this pathway, enters the cytoplasm, and is expressed by the cells (Straubinger et al., 1990) . Several methods have been developed to increase the proportion of DNA delivered to the cytosol. Two general approaches that have been used successfully are: (i) bypassing the endocytic pathway completely, and (ii) using the initial stages of the endocytic pathway but escaping the pathway before delivery of the DNA to lysosomes. The endocytic pathway of liposomal DNA entry into the cell is bypassed when liposomes are fused directly to the plasma membrane of the cell. This has been accomplished using virosomes containing a constitutively active viral fusion protein (Nakanishi et al., 1987) . As soon as the virosome binds to the cell surface, the fusion protein acts to fuse the virosomal membrane with that of the cell, causing the vesicle contents to be introduced directly into the cytoplasm.",

This strategy takes advantage of the low pH of endosomes, which can be used to trigger fusion of liposomes with the endosomal membrane. pH-dependent fusion of liposomes with endosomes has been achieved using vesicles composed of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and substances such as dipalmitoylsuccinylglycerol that leave the membrane at low pH (Liu and Huang, 1990) . As the pH is lowered in the endosome, the effective concentration of PE rises. When the concentration rises above 60 mole percent, the vesicle membrane can no longer remain as a bilayer. As it converts to the inverted hexagonal phase, it destabilizes the adjacent endosomal membrane, and releases the liposomal contents into the cytoplasm. Similar results can be seen using virosomes containing pH-sensitive fusion proteins (Gould-Fogerite et al., 1989; Lapidot and Loyter, 1990) .",

This process may be partially responsible for the loss of expression seen in transfections with retroviral and adenoviral vectors. Another possible cause of low levels of expression is that length constraints of viral vectors usually necessitate the use of cDNA copies of genes. These constructs do not have introns, greatly reducing their length. There is some evidence from transgenic mouse experiments that expression of exogenous genes is higher when at least some of the introns are present (Brinster et al., 1988; Palmiter et al., 1991) . If this is true for genes inserted by viral or liposomal methods, then it may be necessary to include introns in the delivered DNA to produce an adequate therapeutic effect.

The use of basic substances to condense the DNA has increased the efficiency of encapsulation. The addition of nucleophilic proteins raises the efficiency of transfection. By adding antibodies or other targeting molecules to the surface of liposomes, preferential binding of vesicles to a desired cell type has been increased. The incorporation of viral fusion proteins into the membrane allows a greater fraction of liposomes binding to cells to deliver their contents into the cytoplasm. In short, many aspects of a virus from budding to delivery of the genetic material to the nucleus have been mimicked in liposomal vectors. Current methods of liposome-based gene therapy may be improved by modifying the structure of the introduced gene.
