            "text": "The interaction between the nucleocapsid (N) protein of mouse hepatitis Virus (MHV) and RNA was studied in an effort to define portions of the N molecule that participate in binding to RNA. N mRNAs transcribed from SP6 and T7 vectors were translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Analysis of synthesized N protein in a nondenaturing gel system showed that it bound in vitro to an endogenous RNA in the reticulocyte lysate but not to its own mRNA. A set of deletion mutants was constructed in order to localize the RNAbinding activity of the N protein. It was found that removal of as much as 135 amino-terminal or 57 carboxy-terminal amino acids from the molecule had little or no effect on RNA binding. Moreover, deletion mutants lacking both termini still retained RNA-binding ability. By contrast, internal deletions or truncations extending beyond these two limits effectively abolished RNA binding by N protein. Thus, the RNA-binding region of N has been mapped to the second (central) of the three structural domains of the molecule. P.S. Masters: RNA-binding domain of MHV N protein 32.

            "text": "Coronaviruses constitute a family of viruses whose single-stranded, positivesense RNA genomes have the largest coding capacities among the RNA viruses [27, 31] . Paradoxically, coronaviruses have relatively few structural proteins. Their large, roughly spherical virions are enclosed by a membrane envelope containing two (or, in some cases, three) types of membrane-bound glycoproteins. Internal to this, multiple monomers of a nucleocapsid protein (N) encapsidate the viral genome, which, in the case of the prototype mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), is some 31,000 nucleotides in length [10, 19] . The nucleocapsids of coronaviruses are helically symmetric [ 12] , a feature seen in only one other group of positive-stranded RNA viruses, those of the proposed family Toro-viridae [25] . Consequently, these structures pose interesting problems with respect to genome translation as well as in understanding the processes of encapsidation and assembly.",

            "text": "Coronavirus N proteins are markedly basic, and they form complexes with RNA that tend to dissociate in high concentrations of salt and provide only limited protection against the action of ribonucleases [ 12, 22] . In these respects, they resemble the NP proteins of the orthomyxoviruses [ 1, 4] . By contrast, the N -R N A complexes of the rhabdoviruses and the paramyxoviruses, which also form helically symmetric nucteocapsids, are stable in high salt and are largely resistant to ribonuclease [1, 11] . Few details are known about the association between N protein and RNA in the coronaviral nucleocapsid. We have previously compared the amino acid sequences of the N proteins of five strains of MHV and, on the basis of this analysis, proposed a three domain structural model for the M H V N protein [20] . In this paper it is shown that the central of these three domains is responsible for the RNA-binding ability of the MHV N molecule.",

A cDNA clone, pAl5, containing a nearly full-length copy of the N mRNA of MHV-A59 [20] (EMBL/GenBank accession no. M35256) was restricted with SnaBI and SacI, made blunt-ended, and inserted in either orientation into the vector pGEM3Zf ( -) (Promega), which had been opened and blunt-ended at the KpnI and SphI sites of the polylinker. The resulting constructs, pA50 and pA48, contained the T7 or SP6 promoter, respectively, linked to 54 nt of the 78 nt 5' untranslated region (UTR) of RNA7 of MHV-A59 I- 8, 19] , followed by the entire N protein coding region and 225 nt of the 301 nt 3' UTR ( Fig. 1) . HindIII-linearized pA50 encoded run-off transcripts that were bounded by polylinker sequences of 17 nt and 6 nt at their 5' and 3' ends; SacI-linearized pA48 encoded run-off transcripts that were bounded by polylinker sequences of 15 nt and 2 nt at their 5' and 3' ends ( Fig. 1 ). Full-length N mRNAs transcribed from these two plasmids had identical translation efficiencies in vitro. Truncated N mRNAs were transcribed from pA50 that had been linearized with BsmI, ScaI or SpeI and from pA48 that had been linearized with AccI or EcoRI (Fig. 1 ). An internal deletion mutant of the N gene was constructed by restriction of pA50 with [20] . The N mRNA initiation codon is underlined NheI and SpeI ( Fig. 1) , followed by religation of these compatible sites in the vector fragment. The resulting plasmid, pA60, lacked nt 603-920 of the N gene and encoded the mutant protein N/Nhe-Spe. A second internal deletion mutant was generated by cleavage of pA50 with ApaI and NheI (Fig. 1 KpnI site had been inserted immediately preceding the start codon. Details of the construction of pA56 will be described elsewhere. The KpnI(blunted)-HindlII fragment of pA56 was exchanged for the StuI-HindlII fragment of the mutant VSV N SP6 transcription vector pN112 [16] . This yielded a plasmid, pA58, containing nt 1-69 and 370-420 of the coding region of the VSV N gene followed by the entire coding region of the MHV N gene; the encoded protein was designated N/fusl. A deletion mutant of pA58 was created by exchange of the ApaI(blunted)-HindlII fragment of pA50 for the StuI-HindlII fragment of pN112. The resulting plasmid, pA63, contained nt 1-69 and 370-420 of the VSV N gene followed by nt 406-1362 of the MHV N gene; the encoded protein was designated N/fus2.",

In addition, N protein translated from synthetic mRNA was immunoprecipitable by either anti-N or anti-MHV polyclonat antibodies (Peng and Masters, unpubl. data). In vitro-translated N protein had a slightly higher apparent molecular weight than N protein from [35S]methionine-labeled virus of MHV ( Fig. 2 A, lane a).

In this gel electrophoresis system, the major fraction (ca. 60%) of translated N protein migrated into the running gel, forming a discrete band with a mobility of 0.25 relative to bromphenol blue (Fig. 2 B, lane f). The MHV-A59 N protein contains a considerable excess of basic amino acid residues (63 lysines and arginines as opposed to 46 glutamates and aspartates) and has a calculated pI of 10.5 [20] . Initially it was surprising that such a molecule, expected to have a substantial net positive charge, was migrating toward the positive pole during electrophoresis. This result suggested that the N molecule was tightly bound to some polyanionic molecule and migrated as part of a complex having an overall negative charge. That this, in fact, had occurred was shown by incubation of translated N protein with RNase A prior to nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. RNase treatment abolished the ability of translated N protein to migrate into the nondenaturing gel ( Fig. 2 B, lane g) . Thus, synthesized N protein had bound to some RNA species present in the translation reaction, and as a consequence of this complex formation it was carried into the nondenaturing gel during electrophoresis. N protein translated from total RNA purified from MHV-A59-infected cells behaved in the same RNase-sensitive manner (Fig. 2 more immediately digested. The N -R N A complex was more sensitive to RNase A than to RNase T1, possibly due to the different nucleotide specificities of these enzymes (RNase A cuts 3' to pyrimidines; RNase T1 cuts 3' to G residues). Alternatively, the differential sensitivity may have reflected the relative accessibility of each enzyme to phosphodiester bonds within the N -R N A complex. The N proteins of coronaviruses provide their encapsidated genomes only a minimal degree of protection against the action of ribonucleases [12, 22] . Hence, in this respect, the N -R N A interaction in the nondenaturing gel assay resembled that found in the M H V nucleocapsid. The RNase sensitivity of the ability of N protein to migrate into nondenaturing gels was not due to possible contaminating protease activity in the RNase preparations, since the same RNase-treated samples of translated N 148 P.S. Masters protein showed no degradation when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3, lanes an, lower) . Moreover, inclusion of the placental RNase A inhibitor, RNasin, allowed at least partial inhibition of the effect of an intermediate concentration of RNase A (Fig. 3, lanes p and q) . Incubation with RNase-free DNase had no effect on the mobility of N protein in nondenaturing PAGE (Fig. 3, lane r) .",

Since the N mRNAs synthesized from the transcription vectors shown in Fig. 1 contained this portion of the leader sequence, it seemed possible that the N-RNA complex observed in nondenaturing PAGE was that of translated N protein binding to its own mRNA. To test this notion, parallel translation reactions were carried out either with unlabeled N mRNA or with N mRNA labeled to high specific activity (2.4 x 10 7 cpm/gg) with [a-32p]UTP. N protein translated from unlabeled mRNA was labeled with [35S]methionine, while N protein translated from labeled mRNA was left unlabeled (Fig. 4) . It was expected that if translated N protein were binding to its own mRNA, then a 32p-labeled RNA band migrating to the same position as that of [35S]methionine-labeled N protein should have been observed in nondenaturing PAGE. As shown in Fig. 4 (lanes b', c', f' and g') this clearly did not occur. This was not due to failure to translate the 32p-labeled mRNA, since unlabeled and labeled N mRNAs had comparable translation efficiencies (Fig. 4, lanes b, e, b' , and e').",

The mutant N protein translated from this construct (N/Alb4) contained an in-phase deletion of amino acids 380 through 408 but was everywhere else identical to wild type N ( [ 17] ; Koetzner et al., manuscript in prep.). These six mutants, as well as full-length N protein, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by nondenaturing PAGE (Fig. 5) . On SDS-PAGE, all migrated as discrete bands of the expected relative mobilities and were largely unaffected by treatment with RNase A. The N/Ace mutant showed some degree of heterogeneity in both the presence and absence of RNase A (Fig. 5 , lanes e and f).

When analyzed for the ability to bind to RNA, only two of the N mutants, N/Acc and N/Alb4, were able to enter a nondenaturing get to a significant quantitative extent by comparison with full-length N protein (Fig. 5, lanes a' to p') .

Consequently, both N fusion genes encoded proteins initiating with the VSVderived sequence: M A P T V K R I I N D S I I Q P K L P A N E D P D R S A E D D K W L P I -YILG, corresponding to amino acids 1-23 and 124-140 of that protein [16] . The full-length fusion protein, designated N/fusl, contained the entire M H V N protein following this sequence. The amino-terminal deletion mutant, N/ fus2, lacking the first 135 amino acids of the MHV N protein, contained the VSV sequence fused to the remainder of MHV N. Two internal deletions mutants, encoding N/Apa-Nhe and N/Nhe-Spe, were generated by removal of the indicated restriction fragments from one of the original (nonfusion) N vectors (Fig. 1) . The resulting protein products transcribed and translated from these lacked regions of 66 and 106 amino acids, respectively. These mutants were analyzed by the two gel electrophoresis systems and on SDS-PAGE were observed to be homogeneous and of the anticipated relative mobilities (Fig. 6, lanes a to k) . Nondenaturing PAGE revealed that the N/fus 1 and N/fus2 proteins retained the ability to bind to RNA, whereas the deletions in N/Apa-Nhe and N/Nhe-Spe abolished RNA binding (Fig. 6, lanes a' to k') . Quantitation of the extent of RNA binding showed that the N/fusl mutant was 62% as binding-competent as unaltered, full-length N protein (Table 1) . Although the VSV N protein is, itself, an RNA-binding protein, the mutant VSV N protein used in the construction of N/fus 1 and N/fus2 is unable to bind Indeed, for N/fus 1 the VSV N-derived portion of the molecule appeared to somewhat impede the entry of MHV N into the nondenaturing gel. Remarkably, the N/fus2 protein was a better RNA-binding molecule than its parent, N/fusl, in spite of the loss of a large portion of the MHV N amino terminus (Table 1) . Clearly, this deleted portion of the N molecule can play little or no role in RNA binding. By contrast, the deletions in the N/Apa-Nhe and N/Nhe-Spe mutants reduced RNA binding to residual levels similar to those observed for the four shortest carboxy-terminal truncation mutants ( Table 1 ).",

This general mode of RNA binding may be a common characteristic of the N (NP) proteins of RNA viruses having helical nucleocapsids. Bacterially expressed NP protein of influenza virus was shown to bind well to both viral and nonviral RNA substrates when assayed in vitro [4] . The N protein of VSV bound tightly to cellular RNAs when synthesized in the absence of other viral proteins in an in vivo expression system [28] , and it bound to endogenous reticulocyte RNAs or added RNA species when expressed by in vitro translation [16] . The measles virus NP protein, expressed in vivo by a vaccinia virus recombinant, has recently been shown to assemble into structures very similar to authentic measles nucleocapsids, as determined by both electron microscopy and equilibrium sedimentation on CsC1 gradients [27] . For MHV, it has been demonstrated previously that the N protein of this virus can bind to a variety of viral and nonviral RNA species following separation of N by SDS-PAGE and blotting onto nitrocellulose [22, 29] . Thus, it is not unexpected that the MHV N protein should bind in vitro to nonviral RNA species in the nondenaturing gel assay reported here.",

This seems less likely in light of the previously demonstrated RNA-binding activity of N [22, 29] , but it cannot be ruled out until an MHV N RNA-binding assay using purified components is established. If such an N protein-ribonucteoprotein complex is shown to occur, then this may indicate a previously unappreciated interaction between N protein and host cell components.",

Recently, analysis of defective interfering particles of MHV has identified the RNA packaging signal as falling within a 4(10 nucleotide locus near the 3' end of the huge viral polymerase gene [13, 33] , which is unique to genomic R N A and is not found in subgenomic R N A species. Others have reported sequence-specific binding of N protein to nucleotides 56 to 65 of the M H V leader [29] , which is c o m m o n to all M H V genomic and subgenomic RNAs. This latter sequence was present on many of the synthesized m R N A s used in our study, but selective binding to this R N A region was not observed (Fig. 4) . It is possible that the concentrations of N protein and n o n -M H V R N A in the reticulocyte lysate in our assay were too high to allow demonstration of a selective recognition of M H V R N A . We are currently seeking to establish the assay conditions and the correct R N A substrate to examine sequence-specific R N A binding by the M H V N protein.",

In vitro-synthesized mRNAs encoding full-length N protein, a VSV-N:MHV-N fusion protein (N/fusl), an amino-terminal deletion mutant (N/fus2) or central deletion mutants (N/Apa-Nhe and N/Nhe-Spe) were translated and subsequently incubated for 30 min at 30 \u00b0C with either H20 or with 30 ~tg/ml RNase A. A control reaction contained no exogenous mRNA (a and a'), [35S]methionine-labeled samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (a-k) and by nondenaturing (ND)-PAGE (a'-k')[-16]. Thus, the 40 heterologous amino acids of the two fusion constructs were not expected to contribute to the RNA-binding ability of the MHV N protein.",

Hatched rectangles indicate the 40 amino acids (N/fusl and N/fus2) or 8 amino acids (N/fus4) derived from the VSV N protein in fusion constructs. At the bottom is shown the proposed three domain model for the MHV N protein [20] with clusters of positive and negative charge indicated cannot be concluded that the entirety of this domain necessarily participates in R N A binding, and a finer mutational analysis of this region will be necessary to more precisely delineate the features of the RNA-binding site. Domain II of M H V N does not contain the R N P 1 and RNP2 motifs found in numerous cellular RNA-binding proteins [3, 21], nor does it possess a zinc finger motif",
