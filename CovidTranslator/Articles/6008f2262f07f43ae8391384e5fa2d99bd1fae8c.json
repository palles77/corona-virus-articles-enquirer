Methods: Onsite evaluation of 16 hospitals consisted of interviews with managers and health care workers about RPPs and practices, review of written RPPs, and limited observations of personnel using respirators. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: All hospitals had implemented policies requiring the minimum use of N95 filtering facepiece respirators when working with patients with H1N1 virus infection; 95.5% of health care workers (n \u00bc 199) reported they would wear at least this level of protection when in close contact with a patient with confirmed or suspected H1N1 virus infection. However, evaluation of written RPPs indicated deficiencies in required areas, most commonly in recordkeeping, designation of a program administrator, program evaluation, employee training, and fit testing procedures. Conclusions: Health care workers were aware of respiratory protection required when providing care for patients with confirmed or suspected H1N1 virus infection. Hospitals should improve written RPPs, fully implement written procedures, and conduct periodic program evaluation to ensure effectiveness of respirator use for health care worker protection. Increased accessibility of resources tailored for hospital respirator program administrators may be helpful.",

This effort included an assessment conducted by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the personal protective equipment (PPE), including respiratory protection, needed by health care workers in the event of an influenza pandemic. 2 The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued guidance in 2007 for workplace preparedness, including control measures appropriate for a pandemic influenza virus. For health care personnel working in close contact with infected patients, OSHA recommended the use of respiratory protection with an N95 or higher rated filter for most situations and higher levels of respiratory protection (supplied-air or powered air-purifying respirator) for procedures likely to generate bioaerosols. 3 During May 2009 , the California Department of Public Health issued infection control guidance consistent with OSHA pandemic influenza preparedness recommendations for the use of respiratory protection, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took a similar position in its July 2009 guidance. 4 On August 5, 2009, a new California occupational standard for the prevention of aerosol transmissible diseases (ATDs) became effective. 5 The new ATD standard, which had been under development for several years by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA), was designed to make applicable public health guidance for worker protection measures legally enforceable in certain California workplaces where employees are at higher risk of infection, including acute care hospitals.",

Investigations related to severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks have identified difficulties achieving compliance with PPE policies, especially for respiratory and facial protection. [7] [8] [9] A more recent study of hospital nurses found poor adherence to respirator use policies, based on both self-report and observation, as well as low competence when asked to demonstrate respirator use. This study recommended that hospitals improve adherence by focusing on ready availability of equipment, training and fit testing, organizational support for worker health and safety, and good communication practices. 10 In August 2009, the California Department of Public Health, in collaboration with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, initiated a public health evaluation of a sample of California acute care licensed facilities with the aim of assessing the status of RPPs for the protection of health care workers during this pandemic involving a novel pathogen. The objectives of this evaluation, titled Respirator Use Evaluation in Acute Care California Hospitals, were to describe the extent to which hospitals implemented required elements of a RPP for pH1N1, assess the use of respiratory protection for pH1N1 among health care workers, and understand health care workers' knowledge and beliefs regarding the appropriate use of respiratory protection.",

            "text": "We found that all participating hospitals had implemented policies requiring the use of N95 respirators as the minimum level of protection for health care workers in close contact with suspected or confirmed pH1N1 patients, consistent with guidance from state and federal public health agencies as well as the enforceable requirement of the Cal/OSHA ATD standard. Responses from unit and hospital managers indicated a high level of knowledge of this policy (93.3% and 85.4%, respectively). Health care workers from those units overwhelming (95.5%) stated they would select an N95 respirator or a more protective PAPR when caring for a patient with suspected or confirmed pH1N1, demonstrating a high level of knowledge of the policy even if it may not have been consistently followed in practice. We did not assess awareness of the Cal/OSHA ATD standard; thus it is not possible to determine whether or not having an applicable new state regulation was a key factor in promoting the implementation of these policies in California. In contrast, a survey of medical students and residents at a Washington, DC, hospital (November-December 2009) showed that only 13% of medical students and 21% of residents would wear an N95 respirator when caring for a patient with influenza symptoms. 15 Another study conducted at a New York City hospital identified 277 unprotected health care worker exposures related to 44 patients with pH1N1 infection (May-July 2009), explained by suboptimal adherence to PPE recommendations in addition to other factors. 16 In general, the basic elements required with respirator use (eg, medical clearance, fit testing, and employee training) were in place in all hospitals, as demonstrated by consistent responses across health care workers, unit managers, and hospital managers. Because onsite evaluation visits were conducted in January-February 2010, we are unable to report on the extent of N95 respirator readiness in these facilities at the start of the pandemic. Jaeger et al 14 found that 52% of health care workers exposed to the earliest California patients with pH1N1 infections after admission to the hospital were \"N95 ready,\" defined as having been fit tested within the past year and knowing the appropriate size and location of N95 respirators. Data collected from 22 states on 48 health care workers with clinical care duties who had been infected with pH1N1 showed that 69% had ever been fit tested, another assessment of respirator readiness. 17 A National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health survey of internal medicine residents and fellows at 4 Utah hospitals conducted August-September 2009 showed a lower level of training on N95 respirator use (43%) and lower level of fit testing (22% between the beginning of their training and June 2009) than found among this California health care worker sample. 18 Interviewed health care workers overwhelmingly (94%) believed that N95 respirators would be more effective than surgical/ medical masks at protecting them from pH1N1 infection. Given that clearly understanding the differences in protection and appropriate use between respirators versus surgical/facemasks had been cited as a potential challenge for the health care field in pandemic influenza preparedness, 2 our results may reflect progress made in this area. In contrast, 24% of respondents in the Utah study believed that surgical masks and N95 respirators provided equal protection. 18 The heightened awareness among California health care workers about the role of respiratory protection against pH1N1 may have been due to publicity regarding the new ATD standard, and/or employer or union-based educational efforts. Thirty-five percent of health care workers reported experiencing no problems while wearing respirators, and of those who did experience problems, feeling uncomfortably warm was the most frequent issue mentioned (49%), followed by interference with eyeglasses (21%).",

Signage on patient doors, information from coworkers and shift reports, and the health care worker's patient assessment were common responses. Future investigations could look more closely at how hospital respirator policies address this topic, particularly for the earliest health care workerepatient contacts in the hospital, before diagnosis, and for nonclinical staff who may not be included in communications about suspected or confirmed disease status. The New York City hospital study cited earlier, which identified almost 5 unprotected health care worker exposures for each patient with pH1N1 infection who presented with influenza-like illness, highlighted the need to better understand how to more effectively implement screening protocols as well as to achieve adherence to respirator use requirements. 16 In the limited number of observations of respirator users, we did not observe health care workers failing to don a respirator when appropriate; however, frequently identified problems were failure to perform user seal checks, touching the outside of the respirator during doffing, and failure to perform hand hygiene after doffing. Since reuse of filtering facepiece respirators was fairly common (42% of health care workers reported ever reusing a respirator), these latter practices could result in disease transmission due to contamination of the respirator. Further training may be warranted in these facilities on how to properly don and doff respirators, as Table 3  Assessment of written hospital respiratory protection programs   Program element required by OSHA   REACH facility number   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15 16",

These deficiencies in proper respirator use are significant, as they may result in a failure of the respirator to provide its intended level of protection. A recent study with 100 observations of N95 respirator users showed that 76% failed to perform a user seal check and 60% touched the outside of the respirator while removing it. 10 Another observational study performed in 11 hospitals showed deficiencies in proper sequence of PPE removal and only 57% of health care workers performing hand hygiene after removal of respiratory or facial protection. 19 Review of written respiratory protection programs revealed instances where written procedures for 1 or more program elements were lacking or incomplete. Of the 16 hospitals, only 1 had a program that was considered to be complete, and 1 hospital failed to provide a written program. Achieving an effective level of protection from respirator use relies on having comprehensive written procedures for all of the required elements, implementing those procedures, regularly evaluating the implementation of each element (with respirator user input), and making necessary improvements. Such an effort is required under the OSHA respiratory protection standard for any workplace where respirators are used. The most frequently missing program element in the hospitals' written RPPs was program evaluation, followed by the designation of a program administrator. These results suggest that, although hospitals have made substantial progress in implementing the use of respiratory protection, it may be necessary to assign clearer responsibility for overall oversight of the program. Conducting periodic program evaluation, including observations of health care workers using respirators and soliciting input from respirator users, should be broadly implemented. Other areas for improvement of written programs include delineating required recordkeeping procedures, and specifically how fit testing and training are conducted. We are not aware of any other published assessments of written hospital respiratory protection programs.",

Our results provide some insight on how hospitals planned for a potential shortage, most commonly through having employees reuse respirators and store them in a paper bag between uses. Half of interviewed hospital managers reported experiencing a shortage of respirators; they cited increased demand due to higher patient loads and supplier inability to fill orders as the key reasons for a shortage. Those facilities that did not experience a shortage stated that stockpiling respirators helped them maintain adequate supply levels. Most facilities formally documented their respirator supplies and use, as encouraged by Cal/OSHA; this information could be useful for their future pandemic influenza planning efforts. Due to respirator supply issues, some hospitals were forced to use alternate respirator brands or models, and some managers acknowledged an inability to fit test all employees with the new respirator before use.",

First, California was in a unique position regarding pH1N1 because the first cases occurred here, and California enacted the nation's first occupational standard for aerosol transmissible diseases in August 2009 during the peak of the pandemic. Hospitals in California may have been faster to mobilize respirator use because they had been preparing to meet the new standard. Because our evaluations were conducted later in the pandemic, hospitals may have had earlier deficiencies in respirator use that we could not have documented. Another consequence of the timing of our evaluation (influenza activity in California had moved from widespread to sporadic by early 2010) was that some hospital units no longer had any patients on airborne precautions, seriously limiting the number of respirator use observations we could conduct. Therefore, our results and conclusions based on interview data assess knowledge and intended practices, rather than observed practices. Our sample of 16 facilities was small, comprising 5.2% of acute care California hospitals. Hospitals that declined participation (4 out of 20 invited) may have been less successful at implementing respirator use. Although we obtained a sample that was generally representative in terms of size, rural versus nonrural, and type of ownership, generalizing the findings to all facilities in the state should be done with caution. This small sample size precluded analysis of the data by hospital characteristics. Finally, our aim was to evaluate a sample of California hospital RPPs and health care worker respiratory protection practices during a novel pandemic, and the findings are likely not applicable to seasonal influenza or other ATDs.",

One problem identified in the assessment of the use of PPE 14, 17 was that questions did not distinguish between respondents' use of N95 respirators versus surgical/ medical masks. Improved surveillance of PPE use in health care workplaces has been recommended by the IOM. 21 Observational studies of actual practice during a pandemic, as well as of respiratory protection use during more usual circumstances, could further help to inform efforts to protect health care workers from aerosol transmissible diseases. The IOM has made numerous recommendations regarding the role of respiratory protection in preventing the transmission of pandemic influenza and other viral respiratory diseases to health care workers, and continues to track the nation's progress in this important area of occupational health and safety. 21 ",
