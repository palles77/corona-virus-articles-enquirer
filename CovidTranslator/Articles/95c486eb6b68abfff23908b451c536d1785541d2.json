            "text": "The route of entry into the central nervous system (CNS) of most neurotropic viruses has not been established. The coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM (MHV-JHM). causes acute encephalomyelitis and acute and chronic demyelinating diseases and is an important model system for virus-induced neurological disease. Suckling C57BU6 mice infected intranasally with MHV-JHM develop either the acute encephalomyelitis or a late onset, symptomatic demyelinating encephalomyelitis, depending on whether they are nursed by unimmunized or immunized dams. Analysis by in situ hybridization was used to determine the route of entry of MHV-JHM into the CNS in these mice. At early times, viral RNA was detected only in the trigeminal and olfactory nerves and in their immediate connections in all mice. A few days later, MHV-JHM RNA was found throughout the brain in mice dying of the acute encephalomyelitis, but remained confined to the entry sites in mice which did not develop acute disease. These results suggest that MHV-JHM enters the CNS via an interneuronal route in all mice, but that the presence of maternal antibody prevents the dissemination of virus via extracellular fluid. In addition, MHV-JHM may establish low-level persistence in the trigeminal or olfactory nerve or in one of its connections in mice that do not develop acute encephalomyelitis. o 1~8s Academic",

For this reason, mice or rats infected with these viruses are useful for determining the factors important for both acute and persistent CNS infections caused by RNA viruses.

However, in some mice with early signs of hindlimb paralysis, MHV-JHM RNAwas present primarily in areas of the brain connected to the trigeminal and olfactory nerves, the initial entry sites of virus into the CNS. In the example shown in Figs. 4B and 4C, MHV-JHM RNA was confined to the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, and to the mamillary nuclei, the alveus of the hippocampus, and the interpeduncular nucleus; the latter three sites are components of the limbic system which in turn is connected with the olfactory pathway.",

            "text": "The data suggest that after intranasal inoculation, MHV enters the mouse CNS via the trigeminal and olfactory nerves. MHV entry appears to be more rapid via the olfactory pathway, since virus-specific RNA is present earlier in the olfactory bulb than in the brainstem nuclei of the trigeminal nerve (Figs. 1 B, 2A) . Within the trigeminal system, MHV RNA is detected in sensory nuclei and tracts, suggesting that virus spreads initially along sensory rather than motor pathways. Virus presumably enters the CNS via the olfac- tory and trigeminal nerves because they innervate the peripheral site of infection. In addition, MHV-JHM appears to enter the CNS via hematogenous spread in the absence of maternal antibody, as evidenced by the diffuse parameningeal infiltrate observed in mice dying from the acute encephalomyelitis (4, IS, 21). Such a meningeal cellular infiltrate is not apparent in mice nursed by immunized dams, either at early times p.i. or after development of hindlimb paralysis, consistent with the lack of hematogenous spread under these conditions.",
