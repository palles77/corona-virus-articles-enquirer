We recognize that implementation will be challenging and that meeting cancellations are only one of many disruptions currently affecting the research community. Nevertheless, we ask those who have the time and resources available to consider the following seven recommendations (Box 1) to lessen the consequences of conference and travel cancellations on the most vulnerable researchers in our communities.

Researchers from countries with limited funding, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers tend to be the lowest paid and are perhaps more likely to have covered the costs of attending these meetings out of their own pocket (Malloy, 2020) . These groups' risk of financial hardship may be exacerbated by the fact that those with limited resources are often obligated to book the cheapest flights and accommodation, which may not be eligible for refunding or rebooking. For meetings that are not canceled, refunds of registration fees should be given to those who are unable to attend due to travel bans, or who choose not to attend for reasons of personal safety and public health.",

In addition, visa fees can be prohibitively expensive, disproportionately impact researchers from countries with limited research funding, and often are not covered by funding agencies and travel grants.
