In this study, we examine the disease potential for SARSlike CoVs currently circulating in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. Utilizing the SARS-CoV infectious clone, we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse adapted SARS-CoV backbone. The results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild type backbone can efficiently utilize multiple ACE2 receptor orthologs, replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells, and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis. Evaluation of available SARS-based immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy; both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutralize and protect from CoVs utilizing the novel spike protein.

Since then, several strains, including influenza A H5N1, H1N1, H7N9, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV have emerged from animal populations causing considerable disease and mortality 3 . While public health measures silenced the SARS-CoV outbreak 2 , recent metagenomics studies have identified sequences of closely related SARS-like viruses circulating in Chinese bat populations that may pose a future threat 4, 5 . However, sequence data alone provides minimal insights to identify and prepare for future pre-pandemic viruses. Therefore, to examine emergence potential of circulating CoVs, we built a chimeric virus that encodes a novel, zoonotic spike protein in the context of a viable CoV backbone. This approach characterized the threat posed by SHC014-CoV spike in primary human airway cells, in vivo, as well as the efficacy of available immune therapeutics. Together, the strategy translates metagenomics data to help predict and prepare for future emergent viruses.",

            "text": "SHC014 and WIV1 sequences represent the closest relatives to the epidemic SARS-CoV strains ( Fig. 1 a,b) , but maintain important differences in the 14 residues that bind human ACE2, including the five critical for host range: Y442, L472, N479, T487, and Y491 6 . In WIV1, three of these residues vary from SARS-CoV Urbani, but were not expected to alter binding ( Supplementary Fig. 1a , b, Supplementary Table 1 ). This fact is confirmed by both pseudotyping experiments ( Supplementary Fig. 1d ) and in vitro replication of WIV1-CoV 5 . In contrast, seven of the 14 ACE2 interaction residues in SHC014 are different than SARS-CoV, including all five critical residues ( Supplementary Fig. 1c , Supplementary Table 1) . These changes, coupled with failure of pseudotyping ( Supplementary Fig. 1d ), suggested that SHC014 spike is unable to bind human ACE2. However, similar changes had been reported to convey ACE2 binding in related SARS-CoV strains 6, 7 and thus suggested functional testing was required for verification. Therefore, we synthesized the SHC014 spike in the context of the replication competent, mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone (SHC014-MA15) ( Supplementary Fig. 2a ). Despite predictions from both structure-based modeling and pseudotyping experiments, SHC014-MA15 was viable and replicated to high titers in Vero cells (Supplementary Fig. 2b ). Similar to SARS, SHC014-MA15 also required a functional ACE2 molecule for entry, but uses human, civet, and bat orthologs ( Supplementary Fig. 2c, d) . To test the ability of SHC014 spike to mediate infection of the human airway, we examined 2B4 Calu-3 cells, a human epithelial airway cell line 8 , and found robust SHC014-MA15 replication comparable to SARS-CoV Urbani (Fig. 1c) . To extend these findings, primary human airway epithelial cultures (HAEs) were infected and indicated robust replication of both viruses (Fig. 1d) . Together, the data confirm the ability of SHC014 spike to infect human airway cells and underscore the threat of cross-species transmission.",

Animals infected with SARS-MA15 experienced rapid weight loss and lethality by four days post infection (DPI); in contrast, SHC014-MA15 produced substantial weight loss (10%), but no lethality (Fig.  1e) . Examination of viral replication revealed nearly equivalent titers from lungs of mice infected with SARS-MA15 and SHC014-MA15 (Fig. 1f) . While SARS-CoV MA15 produced robust staining in both the terminal bronchioles and the lung parenchyma 2 DPI (Fig. 1g ), SHC014-MA15 had a deficit in airway antigen staining (Fig. 1h) . In contrast, no equivalent deficit was observed in the parenchyma or overall histology scoring, suggesting differential infection following SHC014-MA15 (Supplementary Table 2 ). Shifting to more susceptible aged animals, SARS-MA15 infected animals rapidly lost weight and succumb to infection ( Supplementary Fig. 3 a, b) ; SHC014-MA15 induced robust and sustained weight loss, but had minimal lethality. Histology and antigen staining trends observed in young mice were conserved in the older animals (Supplementary Table 3 ). We excluded use of an alterative receptor based on Ace2 \u2212/\u2212 mice infection, which did not produce weight loss or antigen staining following SHC014-MA15 infection ( Supplementary Fig. 4a , b; Supplementary Table 2 ). Together, the data indicate that viruses utilizing SHC014 spike are capable of inducing considerable disease in mice in the context of a virulent CoV backbone.",

Four broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies had been previously reported and are likely reagents for immunotherapy [10] [11] [12] . Examining percent inhibition, wild-type SARS-CoV Urbani was strongly neutralized by all four antibodies at relatively low antibody concentrations ( Fig. 2a-d) . In contrast, neutralization varied for SHC014-MA15. Fm6, an antibody generated by phage display and escape mutants 10, 11 , achieved only background levels of inhibition of SHC014-MA15 (Fig. 2a) . Similarly, antibodies 230.15 and 227.14, derived from memory B cells of SARS-CoV infected patients 12 , also failed to block SHC014-MA15 (Fig. 2b, c) . For all three antibodies, differences between SARS and SHC014 spikes corresponded to direct or adjacent residue changes found in escape mutants (fm6 -N479R; 230.15 -L443V; 227.14-K390). Finally, monoclonal antibody 109.8 was able to achieve 50% neutralization of SHC014-MA15, but only at very high concentrations (Fig. 2d) . Together, the results demonstrate that despite the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV, these reagents may only have marginal efficacy against emergent SARS-like CoV strains like SHC014.",

Utilizing a high dose, we infected young mice with SHC014-MA15 and followed over 28-days; the mice were subsequently challenged with SARS-MA15 ( Supplementary Fig. 6a ). Prior high-dose infection with SHC014-MA15 conferred protection against lethal SARS-MA15 challenge, but only minimal SARS-CoV neutralization response from SHC014-MA15 antisera ( Supplementary Fig. 6b , 1/200) implying diminished protection over time. Similar results were observed in aged BALB/C mice in terms of weight loss and viral replication ( Supplementary Fig. 6c, d) . However, this infection dose induced > 10% weight loss and lethality in some aged animals ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Using low-dose infection, SHC014-MA15 failed to protect aged animals from lethal SARS-CoV challenge ( Supplementary Fig. 6e , f). Together, the data suggest that SHC014-MA15 challenge can confer cross-protection against SARS-CoV through conserved epitopes, but requires a dose that induces pathogenesis.",

Building upon this finding, the common emergence paradigm argued that epidemic SARS-CoV originated as a bat virus, jumped to civets, and incorporated changes within the RBD to improve binding to civet Ace2 16 . Subsequent exposure to humans in live markets permitted infection with the civet strain, which, in turn, adapted to become the epidemic strain (Fig. 4a) . However, phylogenetic analysis suggested that early human SARS strains appear more closely related to bat than civet strains 16 . Therefore, a second paradigm argued that direct bat-human transmission initiated SARS-CoV emergence, with palm civets serving as a secondary host and reservoir for continued infection (Fig. 4b, 17 ). For both paradigms, spike adaptation in a secondary host is seen as a necessity, with most mutations expected within the RBD and facilitating improved infection. Both theories imply that pools of bat CoVs are limited and host range mutations are both random and rare, reducing the likelihood of future emergence events in humans.",

Coupled with previous identification of pathogenic CoV backbones 1,18 , the results suggest that the starting materials required for SARS-like emergent strains are currently circulating in animal reservoirs. Importantly, while full-length SHC014-CoV likely requires additional backbone adaption to mediate human disease, the documented high frequency recombination events in CoV families underscores the possibility of future emergence and the need for further preparation.",

The approach in this manuscript extends these datasets to examine questions of emergence and therapeutic efficacy. For the SHC014 spike, we define a threat due to replication in primary human airway cultures, the best available model for human disease. In addition, pathogenesis in mice indicates a capacity to cause disease in mammalian models without RBD adaptation. Notably, differential tropism in the lung and attenuation of full-length SHC014-CoV in HAE cultures suggest factors beyond ACE2 binding may contribute to emergence including spike processivity, receptor bio-availability, or antagonism of the host immune responses. However, further testing in non-human primates is required to translate these finding into pathogenic potential in humans. Importantly, the failure of available therapeutics defines a critical need for further study and treatment development. With this knowledge, surveillance programs, diagnostic reagents, and effective treatments can be produced to protect from emergence of group 2b specific CoVs like SHC014 as well as other CoV branches that maintain similar heterogeneous pools.",

Based on previous models of emergence (Fig. 4a, b) , the creation of chimeric viruses like SHC014-MA15 was not expected to increase pathogenicity. However, while SHC014-MA15 is attenuated relative to parental mouse adapted, equivalent studies examining the wild-type Urbani spike within the MA15 backbone produced no weight loss and replication attenuation 21 . As such, relative to the Urbani Spike-MA15 CoV, SHC014-MA15 constitutes a gain in pathogenesis (Fig. 1 ). Based on these findings, review panels may deem similar studies too risky to pursue as increased pathogenicity in mammalian models cannot be excluded. Coupled with restrictions on mouse adapted strains and monoclonal antibodies generated against escape mutants, research into CoV emergence and therapeutic efficacy may be severely limited moving forward. Together, these data and restrictions represent a crossroads of GOF research concerns; the potential to prepare and mitigate future outbreaks must be weighed against the risk of creating more dangerous pathogens. In developing policies moving forward, it is important to consider the value of the data generated by these studies and if they warrant further study or the inherent risks involved.",

Briefly, animals were brought into a biosafety lab level 3 and allowed to acclimate for 1 week prior to infection. For infection and live-attenuated virus vaccination, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine and infected intranasally when challenged with 50 \u03bcl of phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) or diluted virus with three to four mice per time point, per infection group per dose as described in the figure legends. For individual mice, notations for infection including failure to inhale entire dose, bubbling of inoculum from nose, or infection through the mouth may lead to exclusion of mouse data at discretion of the researcher; post-infection, no other pre-established exclusion/inclusion criteria are defined. No blinding was used in any animal experiments and animals were not randomized. For vaccination, young and aged mice were vaccinated by footpad injection with a 20 \u03bcl volume of either 0.2 \u03bcg of double-inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine with alum or mock PBS; mice were then boosted with the same regimen 22 days later, and challenged 21 days thereafter. For all groups, as per protocol, animals were monitored daily for clinical signs of disease (hunching, ruffled fur, reduced activity) for the duration of the experiment. Weight loss was monitored daily for the first 7 days after which, weight monitoring continued until the animals recovered to their initial starting weight or displayed three continuous days of weight gain. All mice losing greater than 20% of their starting body weight were ground fed and further monitored multiple times per day as long as they were under the 20% cutoff.",

Our institutional CoV BSL3 facilities have been designed to conform to the safety requirements recommended in Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the NIH. Laboratory safety plans have been submitted, and the facility has been approved for use by the UNC Department of Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) and the CDC. Electronic card access is required for entry into the facility. All workers have been trained by EHS to safely use powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs), and appropriate work habits in a BSL3 facility and active medical surveillance plans are in place. Our CoV BSL3 facilities contain redundant fans, emergency power to fans, and biological safety cabinets and freezers and can accommodate SealSafe mouse racks. Materials classified as BSL3 agents will consist of SARS-CoV, bat CoV precursor strains, MERS-CoV, and mutants derived from these pathogens. Within the BSL3 facilities, experimentation with infectious virus will be performed in a certified Class II Biosafety Cabinet (BSC). All staff wear scrubs, PAPRs, tyvek suits and aprons, and shoe covers, and hands are double-gloved. BSL3 users are subject to a medical surveillance plan monitored by the University Employee Occupational Health Clinic (UEOHC), which includes a yearly physical, annual influenza vaccination, and mandatory reporting of any symptoms associated with CoV infection during periods when working in the BSL3. All BSL3 users are trained in exposure management and reporting protocols, are prepared to self-quarantine, and have been trained for safe delivery to a local infectious disease management department in an emergency situation. All potential exposure events are reported and investigated by EHS and UEOHC, with reports filed to both the CDC and the NIH. Neutralization efficacy was evaluated using percent neutralization assays against SAR-CoV Urbani (black) or SHC014-MA15 with a panel of monoclonal antibodies: (a) fm6 (n = 3 for Urbani, n = 5 for SHC014-MA15) 10,11 , (b) 230.15 (n = 3 for Urbani, n = 2 for SHC014-MA15), (c) 227.15 (n = 3 for Urbani, n = 5 for SHC014-MA15) and (d) 109.8 (n = 3 for Urbani, n = 2 for SHC014-MA15) 12 , were all originally generated against epidemic SARS-CoV. Each data point representative of multiple center value represents group mean and error bars defined by SEM. Coronavirus strains are maintained in quasi-species pools circulating in bat populations. (ab) Traditional SARS-CoV emergence theories posit that host range mutants (red-filled circle) represent random and rare occurrences that permit infection of alternative hosts. (a) The secondary host paradigm argues that a non-human host is infected by a bat progenitor virus and, through adaptation, facilitates transmission to humans; subsequent replication in humans leads to the epidemic virus. (b) The direct paradigm suggests that transmission occurs between bats and humans without an intermediate host required; selection then occurs in the human population with closely related viruses replicating in a secondary host, permitting continued viral persistence and adaptation in both. (c) The data from chimeric SARS-like viruses argue that the quasi-species pools maintain multiple viruses capable of infecting human cells without the need for mutations (red-filled circles). While adaptations in secondary or human hosts may be required for epidemic emergence, if combined with virulent CoV backbones (green outlines), epidemic disease may be the result in humans. Existing data supports elements of all three paradigms.",
