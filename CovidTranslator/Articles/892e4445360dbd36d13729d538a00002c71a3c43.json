            "text": "Proventricular dilatation disease (PDD) is a fatal infectious disease of birds that primarily affects psittacine birds. Although a causative agent has not been formally demonstrated, the leading candidate is a novel avian bornavirus (ABV) detected in post-mortem tissue samples of psittacids with PDD from the USA, Israel and, recently, Germany. Here we describe the presence of ABV in a parrot with PDD as well as in clinically normal birds exposed to birds with PDD. In two ABVpositive post-mortem cases, the tissue distribution of ABV was investigated by quantitative realtime reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Viraemia was observed in a PDD-affected bird whereas a restriction of ABV to nerve tissue was found in the non-PDD-affected bird. Healthy birds from the same aviary as the affected birds were also found to harbour the virus; 19/59 (32.2%) birds tested positive for ABV RNA in cloacal swabs, providing the first evidence of ABV in clinically healthy birds. In contrast, 39 birds from the same geographic area, but from two different aviaries without PDD cases in recent years, had negative cloacal swabs. ABV RNApositive, clinically healthy birds demonstrated the same serological response as the animal with confirmed PDD. These results indicate that ABV infection may occur without clinical evidence of PDD and suggest that cloacal swabs can enable the non-invasive detection of ABV infection.",

            "text": "Proventricular dilatation disease (PDD) is a fatal dis-order of birds and a major threat to endangered parrot populations (Lublin et al., 2006; Doneley et al., 2007) , including one of the world's most endangered bird species, the Spix's macaw (Cyanopsitta spixii). It is characterized by dilatation of the proventriculus, diges-tive malfunction, and cachexia. Definitive diagnosis depends on histologic demonstration of lymphocytic infiltrates in the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves and myenteric ganglia (Lutz & Wilson, 1991; Vice, 1992; Gregory, 1995; Sullivan et al., 1997; Gregory et al., 1998; Berhane et al., 2001; Lierz, 2005; Lublin et al., 2006; Perpi\u00f1 an et al., 2007) . A viral aetiology of PDD has been presumed (Gough et al., 1996; Gregory et al., 1998) and several viruses were proposed, including adenovirus, coronavirus, herpesvirus, polyomavirus, eastern equine encephalitis virus and western equine encephalitis virus (Mannl et al., 1987; Sullivan et al., 1997; Vice, 1992; Gregory, 1995; Gregory et al., 1998; Grund et al., 2002; Gough et al., 2006; Lublin et al., 2006; Orosz & Dahlhausen, 2007) ; however, none was confirmed and most recently avian paramyxovirus 1 was ruled out (Deb et al., 2008) . A leading candidate only emerged when two independent research groups recently identified a novel avian bornavirus (ABV) in PDD-affected birds (Honkavuori et al., 2008; Kistler et al., 2008) . In one study of US parrots, 3/3 (100%) animals with PDD, and 0/4 (0%) without PDD, had ABV in brain, proventricu-lus and adrenal gland (Honkavuori et al., 2008) . In the other study, ABV was detected in 5/8 (62.5%) PDD birds from the US and 5/7 (71%) such birds from Israel, but not in non-diseased controls (5 and 14 birds, respec-tively) (Kistler et al., 2008) . Both studies showed less than 70% nucleotide conservation of the avian sequences to those of the mammalian Borna disease virus (BDV), and indicated that these viruses represent a novel species with multiple divergent genotypes, possibly forming a separate genus (Honkavuori et al., 2008; Kistler et al., 2008) . In a subsequent report, ABV was described in six parrots in Europe with clinical PDD symptoms, in which ABV was not restricted to cells of the nervous system and the presence of ABV in the faeces led the authors to propose a possible faecal-oral transmission route (Rinder et al., 2009 ). In the same study, seven birds with clinical signs of PDD were tested negative. Bornavirus infection has been previously proposed for an outbreak of neurologic disease in ostriches based on serologic data (Malkinson et al., 1993) . Bornavirus sequences have also been detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in mallard (Anas plathyrhnchus) and jackdaw (Corvus monedula) droppings (Berg et al., 2001) ; however, in these instances viral sequences were closely related to those of mammalian BDV and distinct from the recently identified ABV. A reservoir for ABV, its geographic distribution, modes of transmission, and causative relationship to PDD remain to be determined.",

Z178/08 demonstrated wasting symptoms and shedding of undigested seeds in faeces before it was euthanized. From this bird a crop biopsy free of lymphoplasma-cytic ganglioneuritis, taken 2 weeks prior to death, was also available for investigation. Z1/09, kept in the neighbouring cage of Z178/08, died of ulcerative enteritis but no evidence of nutritional compromise. Tissue samples, blood and cloacal swabs from both birds were collected for histological and molecular biological investigations (see Table 1 ). For molecular biological analysis, tissues were placed immediately after sampling into RNAlater (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and stored within 2 h after sampling at \u2212808C until processing.",

Comparison with four mammalian BDV isolates from horses in Germany and three ABV, for which sequence in the respective genome region is available, grouped strain Z178/08 and Z1/09 sequences (100% sequence identity) in the ABV clade and clearly separate from German horse BDV (Figure 2 ). Strains Z178/08 and Z1/09 from Germany were phylogenetically more similar to strain 1034/1322 from the USA, than were strains 1034/1322 and bil from the USA to one another. Almost identical sequences were also obtained from cloacal swabs of healthy PCR-positive contacts, Bird Z14/09-13 (100% identical to Z178/08 and Z1/09) and Z14/09-28 (97% identical to Z178/08 and Z1/09, GenBank accession number FJ932551; Figure 2 ).",

Although cross-species transfer between ungulate and bird has been achieved experimentally (Ludwig et al., 1988) , its occurrence in nature is unclear. Furthermore, Borna disease of ungulates is not recorded in the USA or Israel despite the presence of a novel Bornavirus in PDD-affected birds in both countries (Honkavuori et al., 2008; Kistler et al., 2008) .

            "text": "Although ABV represents a plausible aetiologic can-didate for PDD (Honkavuori et al., 2008; Kistler et al., 2008; Rinder et al., 2009) , much of its biology remains to be characterized. In the present study we confirmed the presence of ABV in two birds from the same collection in Germany. Whereas Bird Z178/08 had classical symp-toms, gross lesions and histological alterations of PDD, Bird Z1/09 did not have a clinical presentation consistent with PDD. Despite having a characteristic proventricular enlargement, Bird Z1/09 lacked typical lymphocytic infiltrates in nerve ganglia of the digestive tract. Similarly, whereas ABV-RNA was demonstrated in all organs and even in plasma of the PDD-affected Bird Z178/08, ABV RNA was restricted to nerve tissue in non-PDD Bird Z1/09, consistent with the pattern of BDV infection found in immunocompetent mammals (Ludwig et al., 1988; Briese et al., 1999) . However, it remains obscure why the lymphoplasmacytic ganglio-neuritis was not detectable in all organs positive for ABV in Bird Z178/08 and also missing in the proventriculus of Bird Z1/09 despite the fact that ABV was detected in the nerve ganglia of this organ. Rinder et al. (2009) also found ABV extension beyond neural tissues. It is conceivable that early infection or carrier status is characterized by confinement to nerve tissue and that wider distribution only occurs in the late stages of PDD. The presence in healthy birds of ABV RNA in cloacal swabs in association with ABV-specific serum antibodies, which was demonstrated in the present study for the first time, indicates either that ABV is not causally related to PDD or that disease is multifactorial. Differentiating these possibilities awaits formal testing of Koch's postulates. Although shedding of infectious virus remains to be demonstrated, this finding is consistent with a possible transmission mode by subclinical individuals, especially as birds of collections not facing PDD were tested ABV negative.",

The applied RT-qPCR presents an adequate diagnostic addition, although an individual diagnosis based on cloacal swab alone may fail as indicated by Bird Z1/09; despite the presence of ABV in brain and adrenal gland, the cloacal swab tested negative. None-theless, a cloacal-oral route of transmission is plausible. Furthermore, the observation that ABV sequences can be detected in cloacal swabs by PCR offers the prospect for efficient non-invasive surveillance and diagnosis. Until larger data-sets become available, collection of biopsy and cloacal swab for histologic as well as RT-qPCR analyses is recommended for PDD/ABV diagnosis in psittacine birds. Furthermore, ABV-antibody detection by western blot analysis may prove useful in diagnosis as well as a screening tool, especially when screening flocks in conjunction with ABV-RNA detec-tion in cloacal swabs. Sera from PDD-affected Bird Z178/08, asymptomatic ABV PCR-positive Birds Z14/09-13 and Z14/09-05, and healthy PCR-negative Bird Z14/09-47, were evaluated by western blot analysis using recombinant ABV P and N, as well as BDV P and N (p23, p40), demonstrating a strong reaction to ABV N with limited cross-reactivity to BDV N.
