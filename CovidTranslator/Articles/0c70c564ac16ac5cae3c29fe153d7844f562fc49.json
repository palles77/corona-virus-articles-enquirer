            "text": "Mice on a calorie-restricted (CR) diet (total calories restricted to 70% of ad libitum; AL) for periods of time ranging from 3 to 18 months were examined for response to topical treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (RA). Daily application of a 0.1% solution of RA to the shaved skin of UM-HET3 mice on an AL diet produced a severe irritation that was evident by day 4, maximal at day 7-8 and still detectable at day 14. Skin irritation was characterized by redness, dryness, Xaking and failure of the hair to grow at the treated site. In CR mice, the same treatment produced little detectable irritation. Animals were sacri-Wced at the end of the retinoid-treatment period (day 7 or day 14) and skin from these animals was examined histologically. In both AL and CR mice, a similar degree of epidermal hyperplasia was observed. Numerous inXammatory cells (mononuclear cells and granulocytes) were present in the skin of both groups. Occasional S100-positive cells (presumably Langerhans cells) were also observed in the epidermis of skin from both groups. S100-positive cells were also observed in the dermis. When skin from CR and AL mice was incubated in organ culture for 3 days (on day 7 after initiation of RA treatment), similar levels of four diVerent pro-inXammatory cytokines were found in the conditioned medium. Soluble type I collagen levels were also similar. In contrast, the level of matrix metalloproteinase-9 was lower in the conditioned medium of skin from CR mice than in conditioned medium from skin cultures of AL mice. Taken together, these studies suggest that CR may provide a way to mitigate the irritation that normally accompanies RA treatment without compromising the ben-eWcial eVects of retinoid use. CR appears to exert a protective eVect at the target tissue level rather than by a reduction in pro-inXammatory events, per se.",

In both photoaging and natural aging, there is a loss of intact collagen and an increase in fragmented collagen in the skin [12, 45, 49] . RA treatment reverses the increased expression of connective tissuedegrading matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [10, 11] and concomitantly stimulates new collagen synthesis [15, 27, 28, 49] . Given the ability of RA to reduce collagen damage and induce new collagen synthesis, it is not surprising that topical retinoid use not only improves the appearance of damaged skin but also results in better function. SpeciWcally, a number of past studies have demonstrated that RA-pretreatment of skin that has been damaged as a result of aging/photoaging or as a consequence of either diabetes or chronic corticosteroid use improves the healing of superWcial wounds that occur subsequent to treatment [1, 33, 42, 55, 57] .",

At the histological level, one sees a perivascular accumulation of mononuclear cells, with neutrophils and monocytes scattered throughout the dermis and an occasional foci of neutrophils in the dermis or epidermis [3, 14, 23] . Epidermal thickening along with features of abnormal diVerentiation are also seen. Irritation is a major cause of non-compliance among retinoid users. In addition, excessive irritation may counteract the beneWcial eVects of topical retinoid use.

A number of hypotheses have been put forward to explain the beneWcial eVects of calorie restriction. While the mechanisms by which CR might exert its eVects have not been fully elucidated, a reduction in pro-inXammatory events seems to be an important component of the overall response to CR diets. Numerous observations speciWcally linking CR to a reduction in oxidant-mediated, pro-inXammatory processes have been made [7, 34, 37] . Given this background information, the present studies were carried out to assess retinoid irritation in CR mice as compared to their ad libitum (AL)-fed counterparts.

One day later, treatment with RA was initiated. Once daily for 14 days, each animal was topically treated over the shaved area with 100 l of the retinoid solution. In each experiment, some mice (AL and CR) were kept as non-retinoid-treated controls. These animals received 100 l of DMSO alone. Previous studies have demonstrated that treatment of hairless mice with RA in this manner leads to an intense irritation response that can be seen as early as 3-4 days after initiation of treatment and is maximal by day 7 or 8. Irritation is associated with increased keratinocyte proliferation and epidermal thickening [51] . The animals were examined for signs of skin irritation each day after RA treatment. Irritation was characterized by redness, dryness (with small cracks developing in the skin), epidermal Xaking and failure of hair to grow at the treated site. The animals were carefully evaluated for these features and given an overall \"irritation score\" of 1+ to 4+. A 1+ score indicated no diVerence between the RA-treated animals and controls and a score of 4+ indicated maximal irritation. All measurements were made in an unblinded fashion. On day 7 and day 14, cohorts of CR and AL animals were sacriWced by cervical dislocation after exposure to CO 2 . Two biopsies (2 mm full-thickness) from the treated area were Wxed in 10% buVered formalin and used for histology. Epidermal thickness (i.e., distance from the dermal\u00a1epidermal juncture to the upper level of viable cells was assessed randomly at 4 or 5 sites in each tissue section. Two additional 2 mm full-thickness biopsies were put into organ culture using Keratinocyte Basal Medium (KBM) (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with Ca 2+ to a Wnal concentration of 1.4 mM as culture medium. Incubation was at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO 2 . Three days later, the conditioned medium was obtained and used for the various analyses indicated below.",

This observation is of interest from a number of standpoints. First, the data clearly support the idea that retinoid beneWcial eVects can be attained under conditions in which irritation is reduced. Second, these Wndings provide insight into possible mechanisms by which CR functions (and possible approaches for mitigating retinoid irritation). Finally, our results suggest a possible biological test for the beneWcial eVects of CR that could be useful for assessment of CR and related diets in humans.",

Through one mechanism or another, topical treatment of skin with RA results in a substantial keratinocyte proliferative response, leading to increased epidermal thickness [21, 23, 26, 29, 50, 54] . Altered diVerentiation [9, 13, 20] and a reduction in cell-cell cohesion [45] accompany increased proliferation.

Given the similar inXammatory cell inWltrate found in both AL and CR mice and given that there were no apparent diVerences in elaboration oV pro-inXammatory cytokines between the two groups, it seems reasonable to suggest that CR acts somehow to protect the tissue from inXammatory injury rather than by blunting pro-inXammatory events, per se. Consistent with this, previous studies have demonstrated changes in cellular membrane composition resulting (directly or indirectly) from CR [19, 30, 31] . A recent study [19] showed that cells maintained in culture with serum from CR animals had a signiWcant increase in the plasma membrane redox system antioxidants ( -tocopheral and coenzyme Q10). Since oxidants are a major contributor to cell injury in inXammation [17] , increased cellular anti-oxidant levels, especially in cellular membranes, could be expected to provide protection.",

Since both of these transcription complexes regulate synthesis of tissue-destructive MMPs, [2, 10, 11] , interference with either or both pathways could be expected to reduce MMP levels. there was a decrease in MMP-9 in skin organ culture Xuid from CR mice (RA-treated) as compared to AL controls. Although we used MMP-9 as our \"readout\" in these studies, It should be noted that several other MMPs are also regulated at the transcriptional level in parallel to MMP-9 [10, 11] . While there is no direct evidence that MMPs are primarily responsible for tissue damage in retinoid irritation, these enzymes are important mediators of inXammatory tissue injury in other contexts [6, 8, 44] . The lack of decrease with MMP-2 is consistent with this model, because MMP-2, unlike most other MMPs, is not regulated at the transcriptional level [10] . In contrast to these results, we did not see a decrease in the level of various pro-inXammatory cytokines in the CR mice. KC/IL-8 and MCP-1 were both well-represented in organ culture Xuid from both AL and CR mice, but there was no signiWcant diVerence between the two groups. In contrast, IL-1 and TNF-were were barely detectable, but unexpectedly, the levels of these two were actually higher in organ culture Xuid from CR mice as compared to AL controls.

Retinoid patch-testing is a sensitive, reliable and easily quantiWed way to assess retinoid irritation in human skin [14, 23] . As studies on CR in humans move forward [18, 32, 43] , it will be important to have sensitive measures for functional outcomes as well as for metabolic changes that result from dietary modiWcation. One could envision using retinoid irritation as a predictor of responsiveness to treatment on an individual basis. Such a marker could also be useful for assessing how rapidly beneWcial eVects are observed and how long they persist once CR is stopped. Finally, this could be used to help elucidate mechanisms of CR action in humans. Mice on AL and CR diets for 18 months were treated daily for 6 days with RA and sacriWed on day 7. Skin from AL and CR mice was maintained in organ culture for 3 days. At the end of the incubation period, organ culture Xuid was collected and assessed for soluble type I collagen by Western blotting followed by digitization of the collagen band. Values shown (normalized to 1.0 in the AL group) are means and standard errors, based on organ cultures from 8 AL mice and 6 CR mice. Lower panel: MMPs. The same organ culture Xuids were assessed for MMP-2 and MMP-9 by gelatin zymography followed by digitization of the latant and active enzyme forms. Values shown (normalized to 1.0 in the AL group) are means and standard deviations, based on organ cultures from 8 AL mice and 6 CR mice (duplicate organ cultures per mouse). Statistical signiWcance of the diVerence between paired groups was determined using the student t-test. *P < 0.05 relative to AL control skin In summary, the present studies indicate that mice maintained on a diet that restricts their calorie intake to approximately 70% of the calories consumed by AL animals demonstrate signiWcant resistance to the irritating eVects of topical retinoid application. The beneWcial retinoid activities are, however, maintained. These data support the notion that retinoid beneWcial eVects and retinoid irritation can be separated. These Wndings also provide insight into possible mechanisms by which both RA and CR mediate their eVects. Finally, these results suggest a possible biological test for the beneWcial eVects of CR that can be adapted to humans.",
