The dysfunction of epithelial electrolyte transport causes the production of viscous secretion by all exocrine glands. Due to the viscous mucus in the CF patients' airways, recurrent bacterial infections of the respiratory tract commonly occur which play a crucial role in the progression of the disease. The colonization of the lung with bacteria, predominantly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is thought to be the main cause of morbidity and mortality in CF. In the course of the CF disease, fungal colonization of the airways and respiratory infections play an increasing role, especially due to rising awareness of fungal growth in microbiological diagnostic, a longer life expectancy and a rising percentage of immunocompromised CF patients.",

New treatments are available, including mutation-specific therapies that might have the potential to change the natural history of the disease [1, 2] . More emphasis is given to clinical research, and a network of European CF centers has been established with the aim of facilitating high-quality clinical trials to translate new therapies into clinical care. Epidemiological data from many European countries have become available through the EuroCareCF project [3] and national and international registries. Evidence of disparities in allocation of resources and in clinical outcomes has also emerged.",

Data obtained from the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry revealed forecasts for 2025 in 16 European countries that are on one side promising and on the other side dramatic. The data indicated that the number of CF patients will increase by approximately 50%, mainly due to neonatal screening programs. Moreover, the number of CF adults will increase by approximately 75%, a finding that mostly results from the transition of children to adults, whereas the number of CF children will show a 20% increase. These results are crucial as people with CF have complex care needs that demand specialist with medical and allied healthcare expertise. The life expectancy has increased significantly in successive patient birth cohorts [5] as a result of more effective treatments and crucially because most patients attend CF centers in line with the demonstration that patients attending CF centers for their care have better well-being and lung function than those who do not [6, 7] .",

Elevated symptoms of depression were found in 10% of adolescents, 19% of adults, 37% of mothers and 31% of fathers. Elevations in anxiety were found in 22% of adolescents, 32% of adults, 48% of mothers and 36% of fathers. Overall, elevations were 2-3 times those of community samples. Participants reporting elevated anxiety were more likely to report depression (ORs: adolescents = 14.97, adults = 13.64, mothers = 15.52, fathers = 9.20).

Datasets collected from 9 European CF centers (all from different countries in Europe) were thus analyzed. Overall, 66,616 samples from 3235 CF patients were included in this retrospective analysis. The range between the participating centers was from 110 samples (60 patients) to 5300 samples (680 patients) per year (in mean) ( Table 2 ). The age distribution was quite identical; the range was 0-79 years with a mean age of about 17-28 years.

Therefore, the use of mycological culture media is mandatory for the Table 2 Fungal epidemiology in cystic fibrosis and demographic characteristics of the population studied detection of fungi from respiratory secretions from CF patients [21] . For some CF-related fungal species, even more specific media have shown benefit for the diagnosis, particularly when A. fumigatus is present in the sample. Examples for this is the SceSel ? agar for an enhanced cultivation rate of Scedosporium/Lomentospora species or the erythritol-chloramphenicol agar (ECA) medium for Exophiala spp. [25, [31] [32] [33] . Nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that in a clinical setting, the use of more specific media is associated with a higher cost for the laboratory and is timeconsuming. Beside improved isolation techniques, the knowledge about fungal pathogens is mandatory. Laboratories should know the limits of their skills and especially for special diagnostic questions, e.g., colonization with rare bacteria or filamentous fungi, they should utilize the assistance of specialized laboratories in this field [34] . If an in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing is necessary for the filamentous fungi that are detected, this should be done in reference centers or laboratories that are familiar with this.",

It can be assumed that there is an ecological niche for Candida spp. in the respiratory tract due to recurrent antibiotic treatment courses against bacterial pathogens, e.g., Pseudomonas spp. and other non-fermenting rods, or to corticosteroid treatments. If so, it is finally the consequence of bacterial lung deterioration, through antibiotic treatment, that the recovery of yeasts from sputum samples is higher in patients with a lower FEV1.
