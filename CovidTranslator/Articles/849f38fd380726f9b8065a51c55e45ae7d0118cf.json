In the present study, the known SIR model was used for the dynamics of an epidemic to provide a suitable assessment of the COVID-19 virus epidemic in Iran. The epidemic curve and SIR model parameters were obtained with the use of Iran statistical data. The recovered people were considered alongside the official number of confirmed victims as the reliable long-time statistical data of Iran. The results offered many important predictions of the COVID-19 virus epidemic such as realistic number of victims, infection rate, peak time, and other characteristics.",

Given the economic and social impacts of this phenomenon, mathematical modeling and prediction are essential to aware people and decision-making managers of the consequences of this epidemic. Accordingly, the present research team has mathematically investigated the COVID-19 growth in Iran using the available statistical data and epidemic curve. Available official long-time data of Iran were used to predict the number of victims (V) of this virus in this country. Different types of mathematical models can be used for predicting an epidemic infection, and many important unknown variables can be achieved by the use of real available data. The first predictions of an epidemic infection exponential growth, that is typical for the initial stages of all epidemics, have been presented in [1] .",

Accordingly, Nesteruk [3, 4] developed an appropriate mathematical model of contamination and SIR-model of spreading an infection to predict the time dynamics of the unknown children's disease, which occurred in Chernivtsi (Ukraine), and COVID-19 China epidemic. In this paper, the known SIR model for the dynamics of an epidemic [5] [6] [7] [8] is used to identify Iran (COVID-19) epidemic in Iran. In this respect, an exact solution of the SIR linear equations is considered simultaneously with a statistical approach based on the confirmed and recovered victims as the reliable long-time statistical data of Iran [4] . Main epidemic characteristics such as epidemic victim numbers, infected, and recovered people are estimated over time. Furthermore, Iran's official data [9, 10] are fitted to the China epidemic curve [11] [12] [13] and compared with the results of the SIR model.",

Also, Table 2 lists the values obtained by the SIR model for the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran. As can be observed, the official statistical data of Iran for the susceptible and recovered people were used for the extrapolation process. It has been predicted that the maximum number of infected people would occur on 27.03.2020, and the disease peak would occur on 19.03.2020 (which was obtained based on the calculation of infection rate). Hence, due to a 2-to 3-day difference between death and infection peaks, there is a good agreement between the curves depicted in Figs. 1 and 2 .
