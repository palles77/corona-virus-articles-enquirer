It has been reported that severe protracted diarrhea caused by norovirus infection can develop in hospitalized, elderly, and immunocompromised patients (3, 4, 8) . Such patients often shed virus for prolonged periods, which probably indicates active viral replication and slow viral clearance (4, 8) . In an animal model, norovirus was shown to infect and possibly replicate in enterocytes, resulting in disease (9) . Results of our study thus provide preliminary evidence that active viral replication determines clinical disease in norovirus gastroenteritis, as in most other viral infections (10) .

Further research on changes in fecal viral concentrations and their relationships with disease severity are warranted. Because no previous clinical studies describe temporal changes of norovirus concentration in relation to symptoms, we analyzed viral concentration data only in patients with acute diarrhea (days 0-4). Although our defi nition of prolonged diarrhea (>4 days, which was above the median in our cohort) seemed arbitrary, it is supported by the results of many observational studies, which show that in most patients (even elderly or hospitalized patients), acute symptoms subside within 2-3 days (1-4,8) . Inclusion of only norovirus GII.4 infections in the analysis removed the possible confounder of strain variation on viral concentration (5) . Whether similar correlations can be observed with other norovirus strains remains uncertain. Given that genogroup GII.4 is the predominant circulating strain in most countries with major outbreaks (6), these results have implications with regard to pathogenesis and infection control of norovirus infections.",

Further studies are needed to confi rm the role of enhanced viral replication on pathogenesis and transmission of this dis-ease. In addition, the approach of quantifying norovirus by real-time PCR can be used for future evaluation of antiviral treatment (11) and to study factors associated with delayed viral clearance (3). Limited diarrhea is defi ned as a total duration of diarrhea of 1-3 days, and prolonged diarrhea is defi ned as a total duration of diarrhea \u22654 days.",
