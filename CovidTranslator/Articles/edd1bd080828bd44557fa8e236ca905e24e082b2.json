High resolution melt (HRM)-PCR analysis was conducted to examine three OAS1 SNPs: rs2660 G/A, rs10774671 G/A, and rs3741981 G/A in 298 chronic HCV-infected patients and in 305 healthy controls and to identify a relationship between SNP genotype and susceptibility to chronic HCV infection using a case-control study design. These three OAS1 SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium (rs2660 vs. rs10774671: |D'|=1.000, r 2 =1.000; rs2660/rs10774671 vs. rs3741981: |D'|=0.938, r 2 =0.569). The frequency of AG ? GG genotypes in both rs2660 and rs10774671 and the AA ? AG genotype in rs3741981 was significantly higher among chronic HCVinfected patients than among control (P \\ 0.001); the A allele in all three SNPs was found more frequently in the chronic HCV-infected group than in the control group (rs2660 and rs10774671: P = 0.02; rs3741981: P \\ 0.001). Moreover, individuals carrying the A allele in these SNPs exhibited an increased risk for chronic HCV infection (rs2660 and rs10774671: OR = 1.356 [1.051-1.749]; rs3741981: 1.363 [1.085-1.712]). The haplotype created by the G allele at both rs2660 and rs10774671 and the A allele at rs3741981 increased the risk of chronic HCV infection by 3.394-fold (95 % CI 1.406-8.201). Our results identify OAS1 SNP rs2660, rs10774671, and rs3741981 as genetic risk factors for chronic HCV infection. Polymorphisms of the OAS1 gene might affect the susceptibility to chronic infection with HCV.",

OAS enzymes are involved in the antiviral effect of IFN via the OAS/RNaseL pathway. Following exposure to novel viruses, IFN-I is one of the first cytokines released from immune-competent cells. IFN-I subsequently initiates an innate antiviral response via the induction of numerous IFN-stimulated genes. Among these are the OAS genes, which encode the synthesis of oligoadenylates of general structure ppp(A2 0 p9) n A (2 0 5 0 A); 2 0 5 0 A requires double-stranded (ds) RNA structures, such as viral genomes, to become activated. The activated enzyme then catalyzes the polymerization of ATP into 2 0 ,5 0 -linked oligoadenylates (2 0 5 0 A). These, in turn, bind to and activate latent RNaseL, which degrades viral genetic material and inhibits protein synthesis [4] [5] [6] .",

This SNP distribution has not been reported previously; however, the data are consistent with those of the Chinese population in the dbSNP database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP). The frequency distributions of these three sites in the Chinese population differ from those of Caucasian [8] , Japanese [9] , or Vietnamese [10] populations. Therefore, the genotypes and allele frequencies of these SNPs vary by race.",

            "text": "We observed an association between rs2660/rs10774671 and chronic HCV infection; specifically, the AA genotype and the A allele both appeared more frequently among patients than among healthy controls. The SNP at rs2660 corresponds to the amino acid substitution, Arg397Gly. Although these two SNPs are in complete linkage disequilibrium (|D , |= 1.000, r 2 = 1.000), rs10774671 may be a more functional SNP because it is positioned at the last nucleotide of intron 5 in OAS1 and serves as a splice-acceptor site for exon 7. The A allele is predicted to abrogate splicing at this site. Splicing occurs further downstream, resulting in two mRNA forms, designated p48 and p52, which are associated with lower OAS enzymatic activity. The G allele at this site is predicted to allow splicing, giving rise to a p46 form with high enzymatic OAS activity. Heterozygotes exhibit intermediate OAS activity [10, 12, 13] . The p46 form more efficiently synthesizes 2 0 5 0 A, degrades viral genetic material, and inhibits protein synthesis. Hence, individuals carrying the G allele and GG ? GA at this locus are less likely to become infected with chronic HCV. In our study, the frequencies of the AA and AG genotypes at rs3741981 and the A allele were significantly higher in the chronic HCV-infected group compared with controls. Individuals with AA or AG genotypes or with the A allele at this locus were associated with an increased risk for chronic HCV infection. These data support a relationship between SNPs at rs3741981 and HCV susceptibility, with the AA and AG genotypes and the A allele being risk factors for chronic HCV infection. This is explained by the corresponding amino acid substitution at rs3741981. The OAS1 protein belongs to the dsDNA-binding protein family, which is characterized by one or more dsRNAbinding motifs (dsRBM) and by enzyme activation following binding between dsRBM and dsRNA [8, 19] . Substitutions of nearly any of the amino acids within the consensus dsRBM decreased dsRNA binding [20] [21] [22] . The A/G polymorphism in exon 3 of rs3741981 corresponds to the Ser162Gly substitution, which is located near the dsRNA-binding domain (amino acids 104-158) of OAS1. This decreases dsRNA binding and viral nucleic acid degradation. This may explain the observation that different individuals with different alleles exhibit different susceptibilities to chronic HCV infection.",
