            "text": "The present study was carried out to characterize pathogenic E. coli in apparently healthy and diarrheic neonatal calves with special reference to the hybrid E. coli strains and evaluate their clinical and hematobiochemical consequences. One hundred and seventy calves (age 1-30 days) were divided into two groups: apparently healthy (n = 70) and diarrheic (n=100). Animals were subjected to thorough clinical, hematobiochemical and bacteriological examinations. Clinically, diarrheic calves showed various degree of diarrhea with the presence of cardinal signs of dehydration in moderate and severe cases. There was a significant increase (p<0.05) in the hemogram parameters with uremia and hyperkalemia in calves with severe diarrhea. The O-H serotyping of cultural and biochemically positive isolates identified 31 isolates belonging to 12 serotypes including and O128:H2. Molecular characterization of E. coli isolates on three toxin genes: heat-stable enterotoxin (sta), shiga toxin type 1 and 2 (stx1 and stx2) revealed two well-known with high frequency of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Molecular analysis also showed a number of E. coli isolates that carry sta and stx1 or sta and stx2 gene and belonged to O8, and O127:H6, O86 and O128:H2. These isolates were identified as hybrid E. coli strains (ETEC-STEC) and found in both apparently healthy and diarrheic calves. In conclusion, the present study identified high frequency of pathogenic E. coli in both apparently healthy and diarrheic calves. Serological and molecular analysis of E. coli isolates showed that high frequency of EHEC and presence of a new phenotype, STEC-ETEC hybrid, revealing their importance in the etiopathogenesis of diarrhea in calves and reinforcing the role of these animals as a reservoir of potentially pathogenic E. coli for humans.",

            "text": "They mediate diarrhea in neonatal calves via their virulence factors: adherence and enterotoxins. Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) adheres to the enterocyte via fimbriae and mediates diarrhea by secreting heat-stable enterotoxin (sta) (Levine, 1987; Nataro and Kaper, 1998) . Unlike ETEC, Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) strains do not produce toxins (DebRoy and Maddox, 2001) but produces an outer membrane protein, intimin, which mediates the intimate attachment of bacteria to the enterocyte, causing typical attaching and effacing (A/E) intestinal lesions. Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) may also be referred to as verocytotoxinproducing E. coli (VTEC) or enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). They produce shiga-like toxins (stx1 and stx2) and form A/E lesions. EHEC are associated with cases of gastroenteritis in humans, which could progress to hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). It is worthwhile to mention that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is common among various strains of diarrheagenic E. coli strains. Specifically, STEC and http://www.openveterinaryjournal.com N.M. Aref et al. Open Veterinary Journal, (2018) (M\u00fcller et al., 2007) which pose a potential public health threat. Serological and molecular techniques are essential for detection and characterization of pathogenic E. coli and are based on O-H antigens and virulence markers, respectively (Nataro and Kaper, 1998; Ghanbarpour and Oswald, 2009; Bandyopadhyay et al., 2011; Nguyen et al., 2011; Shams et al., 2012) . The clinical and hemato-biochemical alterations in E. coli diarrhea are complex in nature comprising serious imbalances of fluid, electrolyte and acid base status threatening the life of the calf (Singh et al., 2014) . The evaluation of such alterations is important for determination of the proper medical intervention. The present study aimed to characterize pathogenic E. coli with special reference to the hybrid strain in apparently healthy and diarrheic neonatal calves and evaluate their clinical and hematobiochemical consequences.",

            "text": "Toxigenic Escherichia coli have been recognized as the most important cause of diarrhea in both human and animals in developing countries (Bouzari et al., 2007) . Worldwide, E. coli diarrhea is still a persistent problem with significant economic and potential public health impact. Poor management and environmental factors enhance their interaction with their hosts causing dramatic illness and loss in neonatal animals. The present study was designed to screen for and characterize pathogenic E. coli with special reference to the hybrid strains in apparently healthy and diarrheic neonatal calves and evaluate their clinical and hematobiochemical changes. ETEC causes serious diarrhea in neonatal calves. Furthermore ETEC and shigatoxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) have been incriminated in foodborne infections in humans. These two pathogroups are defined based on the pathogroupassociated virulence genes: stx encoding Shiga toxin for STEC and sta encoding heat-stable enterotoxin and/or elt encoding heat-labile for ETEC. The study looked into the toxin genes of serologically typed pathogenic E. coli. Along with the common pathogroups of E. coli, EPEC and EHEC, STEC/ETEC hybrid strains were detected. STEC and other diarrheogenic E. coli are able to acquire virulence genes via horizontal gene transfer from other pathogroups leading to the development of divergent pathogroups (M\u00fcller et al., 2007; Johura et al., 2016) . Such divergent pathogroups are often assigned using different terminology such as \"hybrid\" \"blended virulence profiles\" and \"virulence combination\" (Bielaszewska et al., 2011; Mellmann et al., 2011; Johura et al., 2016) . The coexisting STEC-and ETEC associated virulence genes in E. coli strains of human, animal, and environmental origins has been reported in in Germany, United States and Slovakia (Vu-Khac et al., 2007; Fratamico et al., 2008; Prager et al., 2011) , some of which have been associated with human disease . Previous studies have identified STEC/ETEC hybrid strains from patients and animals in Finland (Martikainen et al., 2012) and from animal derived food in Burkina Faso (Nyholm et al., 2015a) . Comparative genomics and characterization study of such strains has been conducted by Nyholm et al. (2015b) to determine their phylogenetic position among E. coli and to define the virulence genes they harbor.",

Open Veterinary Journal, (2018) In ETEC, the genes that encode both heat-liable (LT) and heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins are found on plasmids, and studies have demonstrated that the enterotoxic activity of ETEC was transferred together with a self-transmissible plasmid. Other studies have demonstrated the experimental addition or subtraction of many features in a base model E. coli strain, enabling these modified strains to cause disease in their host (Kaper et al., 2004) . The current study demonstrated the presence of STEC-ETEC hybrid among E. coli isolates and strongly suggested that this strain might contribute in the diarrhea in neonatal calves and pose a potential public health threat in Egypt. Diseased calves showed various degrees of diarrhea based on their mental and hydration status (Naylor, 2002; Radostits et al., 2007) . Mild diarrheic calves were able to stand without assistance and had good suckling affinity while moderately diarrheic ones were admitted in sternal recumbency, lethargic and weak suckling affinity. Severely diarrheic calves were presented in lateral recumbency with loss of consciousness and no suckling affinity. Aref et al. Open Veterinary Journal, (2018) , Vol. 8(4): 351-359 ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 357 observed in mild cases of neonatal calf diarrhea. This could be attributed to the ability of calves to maintain their suckling affinity. On the other hand, there was significant hypoglycemia in moderate and severe cases of calf diarrhea. This could be attributed to weak or absence of normal suckling affinity, altered intestinal epithelial transport and developing endotoxic-septic shock (Naylor, 2002) . Uremia was a constant clinical finding especially in the late stage of neonatal calf diarrhea which is characterized by marked increase in serum urea and exerts its fatal effect in the pathogenesis of diarrhea. All succumbed diarrheic neonatal calves exhibited a high level in serum urea and creatinine. Serum urea and creatinine levels were significantly elevated in moderate and severe cases (Singh et al., 2014) . Hyponatremia was observed in calf diarrhea but the degree of hyponatremia was directly parallel with the severity of diarrhea. This could be attributed primarily to significant fecal losses of sodium ions in diarrheic neonatal calves. Hyperkalemia was a characteristic finding and commonly noticed in severely diarrheic neonatal calves. It could be contributed to increased renal tubular reabsorption of potassium in response to acidosis in case of healthy renal tissue function but in case of compromised renal function (as indicated by increasing in the values of serum urea and creatinine), shift in potassium ions from intracellular fluid to extracellular fluid (K + -H + exchange) takes place in response to acidosis and hyperkalemia will developed (Naylor, 2002; Radostits et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2014) .",

EHEC were the highest distributed E. coli strain among diarrheic and apparently healthy calves revealing its important participation in the etiopathogenesis of diarrhea in calves and reinforcing the role of these animals as a reservoir of potentially pathogenic E. coli for humans. Additionally, the present study demonstrates, to the best of our knowledge, the emergence of a new phenotype, STEC-ETEC hybrid, that causes diarrhea in calves and pose a potential public health threat in Egypt. Further investigation on a large sample size is proposed to study genetic relatedness/phylogeny of this strain.",

On the other hand severely diarrheic neonatal calves expressed severe dehydration as indicated by severe decrease in skin elasticity and moderate to severe sunken eyeball. Heart rate was variable in diarrheic neonatal calves. Calves with severe diarrhea showed tachycardia (>150/min), week beats and slow jugular vein filling or bradycardia (< 90/min.) with cardiac arrhythmia. Such serious changes could be attributed to hypovlemia, hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. Hematological and biochemical parameters showed significant increase in the mean values of TWBCs, RBCs, Hb and PCV (p < 0.05) in severe diarrhea. Such changes in the hemogram are usually associated with dehydration and E. coli infection. Relative hyperprotenamia was a constant finding in neonatal calf diarrhea and there was a direct relationship between the severity of dehydration and the concentration of total plasma protein. This finding could be attributed to body fluids losses. No change in the blood glucose level was http://www.openveterinaryjournal.com  N.M.",
