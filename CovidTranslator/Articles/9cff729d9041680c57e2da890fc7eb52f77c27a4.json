A phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 gene clustered ck/CH/LHLJ/ 140906 with the 793/B group; however, a pairwise comparison showed that the 5 0 terminal of the S1 gene (containing hypervariable regions I and II) had high sequence identity with the H120 strain, while the 3 0 terminal sequence was very similar to that of IBV 4/91 strain. A SimPlot analysis of the complete genomic sequence, which was confirmed by a phylogenetic analysis and nucleotide similarities using the corresponding gene fragments, suggested that isolate ck/CH/LHLJ/140906 emerged from multiple recombination events between parental IBV strains 4/91 and H120. Although the isolate ck/CH/LHLJ/ 140906 had slightly higher S1 amino acid sequence identity to strain 4/91 (88.2%) than to strain H120 (86%), the serotype of the virus was more closely related to that of the H120 strain (32% antigenic relatedness) than to the 4/91 strain (15% antigenic relatedness). Whereas, vaccination of specific pathogenfree chickens with the 4/91 vaccine provided better protection against challenge with ck/CH/LHLJ/ 140906 than did vaccination with the H120 strain according to the result of virus re-isolation. As the spike protein, especially in the hypervariable regions of the S1 domain, of IBVs contains viral neutralizing epitopes, the results of this study showed that recombination of the S1 domain resulted in the emergence of a new serotype.",

The use of commercially produced, Massachusetts-type modified, live virus vaccines began in the 1950s and has continued to the present. These types of vaccines, such as the Massachusetts (M41) and H120 strains, are the most commonly used around the world because such vaccines have been proven to confer protection against a wide range of IBV strains, including homologous and non-homologous IBV genotype/serotypes (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) . The first known strain of the 793/B serotype, also known as 4/91 (Parsons et al., 1992) and CR88, was isolated in France in 1985 (Picault et al., 1995) . This serotype may have entered the UK in the winter of 1990/91, when it was sometimes associated with deep pectoral muscle myopathy, in addition to the more usual manifestations of infectious bronchitis (Gough et al., 1992; Parsons et al., 1992) . Subsequently, it was discovered that this serotype had been present in most European countries (de Wit et al., 2011) . The first record of the 793/B serotype in Asia was in China in 2003; the virus isolate was named Taian-03, and the sequence of the S1 gene has been deposited in the GenBank database with the accession number AY837465. Currently, 793/B type viruses have been detected in several other Asian countries, including Japan (Mase et al., 2008) , India (Sumi et al., 2012) and Iran (Bijanzed et al., 2013) .",

A number of factors, among which mutation and recombination are two major forces, account for the emergence and evolution of new genetic variants, and they play an important role in increasing the number of variants (Cavanagh, 1992; Estevez et al., 2003; Jia et al., 1995; Kusters et al., 1990; Wang et al., 1993) . Although mutations are very common in IBV genomes, recombination between strains has also been widely reported (Davidson and Silva, 2008; Hewson et al., 2014; Jia et al., 1995; Kusters et al., 1990) . It has been suggested that turkey coronavirus, another group of the gamma-corona viruses, emerged from a host infected with a known IBV strain and an uncharacterized coronavirus that resulted in recombination in the S1 gene and a subsequent host shift from chickens to turkeys (Jackwood et al., 2010) .",

In this study, based on the SimPlot analysis, which was confirmed by the pairwise nucleotide identity comparison and phylogenetic analysis of different corresponding gene fragments, our results provide convincing evidence that recombination events occurred during the origin and evolution of the IBV isolate ck/CH/ LHLJ/140906. Recombination between IBVs and its role in the emergence of new IBV variants have been reported previously (Cavanagh, 1992; Jia et al., 1995; Lee and Jackwood, 2000) and may occur at multiple sites (Jia et al., 1995; Lee and Jackwood, 2000) . This is the case in the genome for IBV isolate ck/CH/LHLJ/ 140906, in which template switches may be occurred between H120-and 4/91-like viruses. It has been shown that crossover events in IBVs occur more frequently at the 3 0 end of the S gene (Chen et al., 2009; Jia et al., 1995; Mondal and Cardona, 2007; Mardani et al., 2010) . However, of the four recombination events investigated in this study, three presented in the ORF1 region (Nsp genes 5, 14 and 16), and the last was located at the 5 0 end of the spike gene. It is particularly notable here that the recombination event in the S1 gene of the IBV isolate ck/CH/ LHLJ/140906 made this virus a novel strain of IBV that is somewhat distinct from both parental viruses, H120 and 4/91 (Fig. 1) , although it is 793/B genotype according to the phylogenetic analysis.",

In China, only Massachusetts-and LDT3-A-based live vaccines are licensed for use. Based on field experience in large establishments, Massachusetts-based commercial IBV vaccines, especially the H120 strain, are extensively used and can persist in the field Fig. 2 . Multiple sequence alignment of S1 amino acid sequences from six 4/91-and two Massachusetts-type IBVs. The numbers on the right of each alignment showed the nucleotide positions in S1 subunit of spike protein of each virus. The sequences of ck/CH/LHLJ/140906 are listed and the only amino acids differing from those of ck/CH/LHLJ/ 140906 are depicted. The three hypervariable regions (HVRs) are boxed. The deleted nucleotides are represented as -. The cleavage sites of S1 subunit of spike protein are underlined. The GenBank accession numbers are the same as those in Fig. 1 . for long periods. In regard to the 4/91-like viruses, this type of vaccine was introduced to China in the late 1990s before the detection of this genotype in the field. Increased numbers of this type of virus have been isolated from chicken flocks of various bird farms in recent years in China. In addition, based on partial sequencing of the S1 gene, it appears that IBV strain 4/91 can change rapidly or that multiple introductions have occurred, e.g., the S1 genes of the 4/91 isolates were 97.8-98.6% identical to that of the IBV 4/ 91 vaccine in Canada in 2012; however, in 2013, the identity was 94.3-98.8% (Martin et al., 2014) . The 4/91-like sequence from isolate ck/CH/LHLJ/140906 was more than 99.6% identical to the S1 gene of the 4/91 vaccine strain, suggesting that the vaccine was the likely source of the 4/91-like sequence. Therefore, it is noteworthy that the natural recombination event demonstrated here suggests that sometimes live vaccines can be involved in recombination.",

            "text": "In contrast to virus species belonging to the alpha-and betacoronaviruses, which occur as only one or two different serotypes, there are many different serotypes of chicken IBV gamma-coronaviruses (Jackwood, 2012; de Wit et al., 2011) . As the main antigenic viral protein containing epitopes for neutralization (Cavanagh, 2003) , the high sequence diversity of the S1 domain accounts for this serotypical variation. Consequently, the analysis of the S1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein to distinguish between genotypes has allowed the IBVs actually present on farms to be readily identified, and this has allowed the vaccine genotype to match that of any current field threat. Furthermore, the technique has allowed the detection of new genotypes or variants, some of which might cause disease. A complicating factor in regard to genotyping IBVs is that when the IBV strain tested is the result of a recombination event in the S1 subunit regions of the spike protein between different IBV genotypes, an examination of different parts of S1 can result in the determination of a different genotype (Wang et al., 1993; Jia et al., 1995; Dolz et al., 2008) . In this study, isolate ck/CH/LHLJ/140906 shared similar amino acid sequence identities of the S1 subunit of the spike protein to those of the 4/ 91 and H120 vaccine strains (88.2% to 4/91 and 86% to H120) due to a recombination event in the S1 gene, although it was clustered with 793/B-type viruses when the phylogenetic tree was constructed using S1 genes (Fig. 1) . In contrast, the ck/CH/LHLJ/ 140906 was serologically more closely related to strain H120 than strain 4/91. Using monoclonal antibodies, five conformation-dependent, neutralizing antigenic sites were mapped on S1, as were other immunodominant regions in the N-terminal regions of S2 (Koch et al., 1990; Kusters et al., 1989; Lenstra et al., 1989) . The five neutralizing antigenic sites on S1 co-locate within three hypervariable regions (HVRs) (Cavanagh et al., 1988 Moore et al., 1997; Niesters et al., 1987) , suggesting that the HVRs are involved in antigenicity and, hence, serotypical variation. In this study, the first two HVRs were found to be located in the H120-like sequences in ck/CH/LHLJ/140906, and the third HVR was in the 4/91-like sequence, suggesting that a recombination event in the S1 gene likely accounts for the serotype shift of the 4/91 genotype to a new serotype, although multiple recombination events were identified in the genome of the virus. Hence, genomic information is objective and provides essential information for epidemiological studies and evolutionary analyses in this case.",

            "text": "In general, IBV strains that have been shown to have the same serotype by virus neutralization may be able to induce complete immunity in chickens based on challenge studies, although in some cases, IBV strains of different serotypes can induce partial or complete immunity in chickens (Ladman et al., 2006) . The broader degree of cross-protection in birds is likely to be related to cell-mediated immune responses to shared T-cell epitopes among some heterologous strains Seo et al., 2000) . In this study, 4/91 vaccination conferred better protection against challenge with ck/CH/LHLJ/140906 than did the H120 vaccine in our vaccination-challenge test, which contrasts with the results that showed that the serotype of ck/CH/LHLJ/140906 was more closely related to that of the H120 strain. Generally, there is a higher chance of good cross-protection between strains with a high level of homology than between strains with low homology (de Wit et al., 2011) , and a previous report showed that S1 sequence identity values were more strongly correlated with protective relatedness values than antigenic relatedness values (Ladman et al., 2006) . In this study, IBV strain ck/CH/LHLJ/ 140906 had higher S1 amino acid identity with strain 4/91 than with strain H120. However, the regions in the S1 domain that were considered to contribute to the cross-protection and serotypical variation were HVRs, especially HVR I and HVR II (Ladman et al., 2006) . These two HVRs in the S1 subunit of the spike protein of ck/CH/LHLJ/140906 were H120-like, which cannot explain why vaccination with strain 4/91 conferred better protection against ck/CH/LHLJ/140906 than did vaccination with strain H120, despite the fact that the serotype of ck/CH/LHLJ/140906 was more closely related to that of the H120 strain. However, isolate ck/CH/LHLJ/ 140906 shared higher sequence identity in the S2 domain and in the N protein with the 4/91 vaccine than with those of strain H120; these regions are also important for the immune response, especially cell-mediated immune responses Wickramasinghe et al., 2014) . The IBV strain ck/CH/LHLJ/140906 in this study was isolated from H120-vaccinated broilers that showed signs of respiratory disease. However, the 20-day-old SPF chickens did not show clinical signs and mortality when challenged with this strain in this study. These results may not be in conflict with the field results because our observations were obtained from SPF chickens over short periods of time and only considered chickens infected with ck/CH/LHLJ/140906 alone. If other factors, such as secondary infections with pathogenic bacteria or co-infections with immunosuppressing viruses, such as infectious bursal disease virus, are thought to be important in commercial broilers in field conditions (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) , the present results would have to be adjusted and re-evaluated. Otherwise, 20-day-old SPF white leghorn layers may be not susceptible to ck/CH/LHLJ/140906 strain. In addition, it was possible that ck/CH/LHLJ/140906 strain was indeed non-pathogenic giving that the virus emerged from recombination of vaccine strains and some other agent caused or contributed to the clinical signs observed in the field. Hence, challenge studies in younger chickens or in broilers will be needed to verify the possibility that the virus is indeed non-pathogenic.",
