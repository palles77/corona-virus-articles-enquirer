Humoral immunity is not protective and conventional vaccines seem to accelerate the www.elsevier.com/locate/vetmic Veterinary Microbiology 111 (2005) [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] disease progress rather than being protective (Vemmema et al., 1990) . This has been attributed to antibodies that facilitate the uptake of virus into macrophages (Hayashi et al., 1983; Pedersen, 1995; Olsen et al., 1992 Olsen et al., , 1993 Hohdatsu et al., 1994) . The histopathological lesions in the wet form of FIP (mainly vasculitis) are suggestive of a type III hypersensitivity reaction. On the other hand, the histopathological picture in the dry form of FIP (mainly granuloma formations) point in the direction of a type IV immune reaction. Based on these and other observations it has been hypothesized that animals with a weak cell-mediated immunity (CMI) in combination with a strong humoral immune response are likely to develop wet FIP. In contrast, cats with a moderately strong CMI would develop the dry form of the disease. Finally, cats with a strong CMI may not develop the disease at all (Pedersen, 1995) . The viral influence on the type of immune response mounted against the viral infection is not known, but is assumed to be acquired, via mutation from the harmless feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) into the lethal feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) (Vennema et al., 1998) .",

To identify macrophages, a biotinylated Griffonia Simplicifolia lectin (Vector Laboratories) was used. The monoclonal antibodies were applied overnight, after blocking steps with avidin, biotin and normal horse serum. On day 2, a biotinylated horse anti-mouse antibody (Vector Laboratories) was applied to the sections for 30 min at a dilution of 1:200. Following quenching of endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% H 2 O 2 for 15 min, an avidin-biotin complex (ABC) (Vector Laboratories) was added to the sections for 30 min.

Here, our results differ somewhat from Kipar et al. (1998) , who reported that T cells only occurred in low numbers in all types of lesions. This discrepancy in results might be due to different specificities of the antibodies used for immunohistochemistry: non-cat specific (Kipar et al.) versus cat specific. CD4+ cells tended to be more numerous than CD8+ cells in type B lesions, providing some support for the notion of a type IV hypersensitivity reaction in the pathogenesis of FIP (Paltrinieri et al., 1998b) . The same predominance of CD4+ cells over CD8+ cells in FIP granulomas was reported by Paltrinieri et al. (1998a) , who used a different panel of monoclonal antibodies. A further indication of a type IV hypersensitivity reaction is the presence of multinucleated giant cells in type B lesions. This cell type, not commonly reported as a feature of FIP, usually occurs during conditions of chronic stimulation of macrophages (e.g. tuberculosis) (Tizard, 1987) .",

            "text": "However, the only significant difference between types A and B lesions was a higher proportion of mature plasma cells, and a lower proportion of B lymphocytes, in type A lesions. Accumulation and maturation of B lymphocytes into FCoV antibodyproducing plasma cells is supposed to lead to deposition of immune complexes within vessel walls and complement-mediated vascular injury (Olsen, 1993; de Groot and Horzinek, 1995; Pedersen, 1995) . It can thus be assumed that since type A lesions are closely associated with vasculitis and peritoneal/ pleural effusion, our findings of numerous plasma cells in type A lesions support this theory. A somewhat unexpected finding was the increased expression of IFN-g within inflammatory lesions of both types, but in particular type B. In contrast, previous studies on experimentally infected cats have indicated that IFN-levels are low in these animals, accounting for a poor CMI, and thus development of disease (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998; Kiss et al., 2004) . However, those results were obtained using peripheral blood mononuclear cells only. It seems likely that cytokine profiles run on samples from tissues with relevant inflammatory lesions would reflect the local cytokine response more adequately. In a recent study, Dean et al. (2003) found a non-significant tendency of elevated IFN-g mRNA expression in lymphoid tissues in FIP-infected cats as compared to controls. Also, in a study focused on the neurological form of FIP, Foley et al. (2003) showed that cats with generalized FIP (but not cats with purely neurological affection) had upregulation of IFN-g as well as several other Th1-associated cytokines in the brain. However, the variation between cats was high and no consistent Th1-or Th2-pattern could be distinguished.",

Macrophages are, without question, the most predominant inflammatory cells in FIP lesions. Cytokines secreted by local T cells will attract more macrophages to the lesions, thereby stimulating and preserving the granulomatous inflammation. Of particular interest in this context is the role of IFN-g. A strong local IFN-g expression would be expected to result in activation of macrophages, including an increase in the number of Fc-receptors on the macrophage cell membrane. Thus, viral uptake in macrophages is enhanced and viral replication increased. On the other hand, a strong IFN-g response is considered to be vital in the defense against viral agents, stimulating the differentiation of cytotoxic T cells.",

The immune response against a virus is a complex interplay between different cells and the molecules they produce, cytokines, chemokines and their receptors. In addition, many molecules are redundant, having many different effects and acting on different cells. To further elucidate the intriguing immunopathogenesis of FIP it is necessary to perform complete cytokine profiles on relevant inflammatory lesions from a larger number of cats with the three major forms of the disease, as well as to determine the timing of cytokines and inflammatory cells in experimentally infected cats.",
