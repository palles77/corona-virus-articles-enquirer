One hundred fifty-two subjects (63.8 F 10.2 years) were repeatedly assessed in the first 4 postoperative months. Average recovery curves for the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, 6-minute walk test, and timed up and go test were characterized using hierarchical linear modeling. Recovery predictors were sequentially modeled after validation of the basic developmental models. Gender was a significant predictor ( P V .003) of physical performance measure scores 1 week after surgery. Thereafter, men and women had similar rates of improvement. Preoperative score was a significant predictor ( P V .001) in all models. Patients' and surgeons' expectations of outcome need to take preoperative function into account.",

Postoperatively, all patients were treated using a standardized inpatient protocol, following either a primary total hip or knee care pathway. Patients undergoing TKA were permitted to be full weight bearing and participated in a progressive program of range of motion, strengthening exercises, and functional training. Patients after THA were educated about postoperative movement restrictions, and mobility and strengthening exercises were initiated. In this sample, most of the patients had weightbearing restrictions.",

Because the main goals of arthroplasty are to decrease pain and improve function, similar to other research [2, 3, 19] , only the pain (5 items) and physical function subscales (17 items) of the WOMAC were profiled. The WOMAC is considered one of the leading self-report measures of outcome in the arthroplasty population, and numerous studies have examined its reliability, validity, and responsiveness. McConnell et al [20] have provided an excellent summary of this work. In the current study, patients completed the full-length Likert scaled version of the WOMAC (LK 3.1). Each subscale is rated on a scale of 0 to 4 with a maximum score of 20 on the pain subscale and 68 on the physical function subscale with higher scores representing more pain and worse function. The total scores from each of the pain and physical function subscales were used in the analyses.",

            "text": "Another potential limitation of this study was the sample. The mean scores of the performance measures preoperatively (Table 1 ) indicated higher function than those reported in other studies [10, 19, 24, 42] . One potential explanation was the age of our sample with 25% of the patients 58 years or younger. As noted in the Canadian Joint Replacement Registry, the numbers of THA and TKA in the 45 to 54 years age group have increased between 1994/1995 and 1999/2000 [43] . The older age of the subjects lost to follow-up may have been a consideration; however, they did not differ on their preoperative scores. In addition, individuals with higher disability may have chosen not to participate because of the performance measure requirement. The aforementioned factors could alter the estimation of the growth curves. Therefore, it is important to replicate the findings in new samples and different settings.",

Gender was a predictor in only the physical performance measure models. In these models, although women began with worse function 1 week after surgery, their rate of recovery was similar to men. Baseline preoperative score was a predictor of outcome in all of the models. Understanding the early postoperative physical disability of patients can be of assistance in determining resource allocation and discharge destination as lengths of stay continue to decrease. Surgeons' expectations of outcome need to take preoperative function into account. Similarly, the importance of preoperative function as a predictor of postoperative recovery has significant implications for the preoperative treatment and education of arthroplasty candidates.",
