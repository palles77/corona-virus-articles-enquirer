With the confirmation of resistance against the only available drug toltrazuril, there is a substantial need for novel therapeutics to combat the infection and its negative effects on animal health. In closely related apicomplexan species, bumped kinase inhibitors (BKIs) targeting calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) were shown to be effective in inhibiting host-cell invasion and parasite growth. Therefore, the gene coding for Cystoisospora suis CDPK1 (CsCDPK1) was identified and cloned to investigate activity and thermal stabilization of the recombinant CsCDPK1 enzyme by BKI 1369. In this comprehensive study, the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of BKI 1369 in piglets experimentally infected with Cystoisospora suis (toltrazuril-sensitive, Wien-I and toltrazuril-resistant, Holland-I strains) were determined in vivo and in vitro using an established animal infection model and cell culture, respectively. BKI 1369 inhibited merozoite proliferation in intestinal porcine epithelial cells-1 (IPEC-1) by at least 50% at a concentration of 40 nM, and proliferation was almost completely inhibited (> 95%) at 200 nM. Nonetheless, exposure of infected cultures to 200 nM BKI 1369 for five days did not induce structural alterations in surviving merozoites as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Five-day treatment with BKI 1369 (10 mg/kg BW twice a day) effectively suppressed oocyst excretion and diarrhea and improved body weight gains in treated piglets without obvious side effects for both toltrazuril-sensitive, Wien-I and resistant, Holland-I C. suis strains. The plasma concentration of BKI 1369 in piglets increased to 11.7 \u03bcM during treatment, suggesting constant drug accumulation and exposure of parasites to the drug. Therefore, oral applications of BKI 1369 could potentially be a therapeutic alternative against porcine cystoisosporosis. For use in pigs, future studies on BKI 1369 should be directed towards ease of drug handling and minimizing treatment frequencies.",

            "text": "Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are promising targets for the development of anti-apicomplexan drugs (Hui et al., 2015; Kugelstadt et al., 2011; Ojo et al., 2013) . Apicomplexan CDPKs, belonging to a superfamily of serine-threonine kinases, are among the most abundant classes of calcium sensors and are crucial for multiple physiological functions such as gliding, cell invasion, egress and replication (Kugelstadt et al., 2011; Ojo et al., 2012) . Most importantly, these CDPKs are absent in mammalian hosts, rendering them excellent parasite-specific drug targets (Billker et al., 2009; Larson et al., 2012; Ojo et al., 2010) . CDPKs in apicomplexan parasites can be effectively targeted by bumped kinase inhibitors (BKIs), a class of synthetic competitive inhibitors of ATP-binding. BKI selectivity is based on a small 'gatekeeper' residue present in apicomplexan CDPK1 . This allows for BKIs with large aromatic moieties displayed from A wide range of BKIs have already been evaluated for efficacy against coccidian parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii (Doggett et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2012; Winzer et al., 2015) , Neospora caninum S\u00e1nchez-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2018) , Besnoitia besnoiti (Jim\u00e9nez-Mel\u00e9ndez et al., 2017) , Sarcocystis neurona and Cryptosporidium parvum Schaefer et al., 2016) . No consistent side effects of BKIs have been observed in these in vivo trials. Cystoisospora suis is a close relative of T. gondii and N. caninum within the family Sarcocystidae (Ogedengbe et al., 2015; Samarasinghe et al., 2008) . Therefore, existence of the ortholog of CDPK1 in C. suis and consequently efficacy of BKIs, originally developed for inhibition of TgCDPK1, was expected.",

Cystoisosporosis is characterized by watery-to-pasty non-hemorrhagic diarrhea, impaired weight gain and reduced and uneven weaning weights in piglets, and consequently imposes significant economic losses on the pig farming industry (Mundt et al., 2005 (Mundt et al., , 2007 Shrestha et al., 2015) .

IJP: Drugs and Drug Resistance 10 (2019) 9-19 The identified CDPK1-type kinase in C. suis, CsCDPK1, showed a high degree of sequence similarity in the ATP binding domain with TgCDPK1, HhCDPK1, BbCDPK1, SnCDPK1 and NcCDPK1 having > 97% amino acid identity with glycine as the gatekeeper residue. Unlike all the previously studied apicomplexan recombinant CDPK enzymes, the peptide substrate syntide-2 (PLARTLSVAGLPGKK) was not compatible for measurement of CsCDPK1 kinase activity in vitro. This is inspite of the highly conserved amino acid sequence similarities between CsCDPK1 and other CDPK1 enzyme active sites. However, CsCDPK1 auto-phosphorylation activity could be measured in the presence or absence of calcium and with or without a suitable peptide substrate. Experimental analysis confirmed its calcium dependency as determined in phosphorylation reactions using EGTA as a Ca 2+ chelator in the presence or absence of PLKtide (Signalchem Richmond, BC, Canada) peptide substrate (CKKLGEDQAEEISDDLLED-SLSDEDE). This calcium dependent regulation of enzyme activity is a verification that it belongs to the same family as previously described apicomplexan CDPKs . Future studies will be needed to determine the potential divergence of functions, natural substrates or pathways of CsCDPK1 relative to other CDPKs. Nonetheless, sensitivity to BKIs by a direct inhibition of enzyme activity was confirmed in direct enzyme activity assay and further demonstrated indirectly by a thermal stabilization assay.",

Further validation of the relatedness of CsCDPK1 to TgCDPK1 was shown by improved EGTA thermal stabilization of the enzymes relative to the control where Ca 2+ is presumably bound to the recombinant enzyme ( Supplementary Fig.  S2B ) as previously reported (Scheele et al., 2018) .

            "text": "The experimental model of suckling piglet cystoisosporosis was previously employed to evaluate efficacy of anticoccidial treatment based on quantitative and qualitative oocyst shedding, fecal consistency/diarrhea, body weight development and general animal health (Joachim and Mundt, 2011; Joachim et al., 2014 Joachim et al., , 2018b Mundt et al., 2006 Mundt et al., , 2007 Shrestha et al., 2015) . In mammalian species an anticoccidial is considered to be efficient in vivo when oocyst shedding is noticeably reduced (indicating reduced environmental contamination with parasite stages, i.e. reduced infection pressure) and animal health and weight gain are improved compared to the mock-treated control (Joachim et al., 2018a) . Treatment with BKI 1369 significantly reduced oocyst excretion and diarrhea in piglets infected with C. suis in the presence of other entero-pathogens. The high efficacy of BKI 1369 in reducing oocyst excretion and diarrhea is comparable to that of toltrazuril (Mundt et al., 2007; Joachim and Mundt, 2011; Joachim et al., 2018b) and was observed irrespective of the parasite strain employed, indicating that BKI 1369 therapy could be effective in combating toltrazuril susceptible as well as resistant C. suis. It has been suggested that lesions induced by intracellular replication of C. suis impair physiological and functional balance of the intestine and therefore have a negative impact on body weight development of piglets (Mundt et al., 2006) . A similar effect of C. suis infection was observed in this study with significantly lower daily body weight gain and total weight gain in the control piglets compared to BKI 1369 treated piglets during the acute phase of infection. This effect tended to wane in the following period (after SD 15), which might be due to gradual healing of the intestinal epithelium and maturation of the immune system with increasing piglet age, a general feature in coccidiosis. Histological sections from mock treated control piglets revealed cuboidal villous epithelium, shortened villi and villous fusion together with numerous merogonic stages of C. suis within parasitophorus vacuoles. In comparison, morphological alterations in the gut were not observed in treated piglets, which underpins the hypothesis that C. suisinduced intestinal damage disturbs the physiological function of the intestine, ultimately leading to diarrhea, malabsorption of nutrients and reduced weight gain (Lindsay et al., 1985; Stuart et al., 1982) .",

            "text": "BKI 1369 achieved therapeutic concentrations in piglet plasma in the micromolar range, far above the effective in vitro levels (IC 95 = 200 nM). The plasma concentration already reached a peak 2 h after the 1st dose and the concentration gradually increased to 11.7 \u03bcM 2 h before the 9th dose, indicating accumulation of the drug in plasma after treatment twice daily for 5 days. Consequently, assuming similar levels are found in infected gut epithelium, the in vivo parasites were constantly exposed to very high concentrations of BKI 1369. This could be the reason for the complete cessation of parasite development and replication in vivo compared to in vitro experiments. These results are in accordance with previous studies on BKI 1369 in C. hominis infected piglets, which reported low concentrations of the metabolites during the dosing period. Further pharmacokinetics studies in piglets to determine the concentrations of BKI 1369 in gastrointestinal tissues over time would be warranted to better understand the relationship between efficacy and exposure at the infection sites. Also, since the plasma levels reached the observed concentrations of 11.7 \u03bcM during dosing, well above the 1 \u03bcM concentration that showed effects in vitro to IPEC-1 cell viability, multi-dose toxicity studies that include blood chemistry and histopathology would be warranted to fully assess any effects that BKI 1369 might have on the host species. In summary, the present study evaluated therapeutic efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety parameters of BKI 1369 against porcine cystoisosporosis in an experimental infection of its natural host. Application of single drug concentration is one of the major limitations of this study, due to which it was not possible to determine minimal effective drug concentration and to develop practical drug application scheme. Oral applications of BKI 1369 were highly effective in reducing oocyst shedding and diarrhea, and improved body weight gain in piglets infected with C. suis, including the toltrazuril-resistant Holland-I isolate, without adverse effects. The successful outcome in both the in vitro culture and the animal infection model of porcine cystoisosporosis also strongly argues for developing BKI 1369 as a chemotherapeutic compound against this disease, both in pigs and in other mammals including humans (Shrestha et al., 2015) . However, BKI 1369 therapy in the field might have practicability issues, owing to the need for multiple doses. Therefore, future studies on BKI 1369 should be concentrated towards ease of drug handling and reducing treatment frequencies.",
