New diseases have emerged from industrial pollution and HIV infection, while better imaging has revealed others previously unrecognized. Scientific advances in microbiology, imaging and clinical measurement have improved diagnosis and allowed better targeted treatment. Advances in treatment have been dramatic, the most important being drugs (antibiotics, cortisone, b 2 -adrenoceptor agonists), ventilatory support (from iron lung to nasal positive-pressure ventilation), inhaled therapy (metered dose inhalers, nebulizers) and lung surgery (resections, videoassisted thoracoscopic surgery, transplantation). Delivery of care has shifted from sanatoria for the rich but nothing at all for the poor, to universal coverage in both primary and hospital care. Generalists have turned into super-specialists and doctors have been joined by growing numbers of professions allied to medicine. Management of lung disease has vastly improved but the impact of disease remains.",

Pneumonia finished off Sir Francis Bacon in 1626 as he stuffed a chicken full of snow, killed Rene Descartes in 1650 as he taught freezing philosophy lessons to Queen Christina of Sweden and Leo Tolstoy in 1910 in a lonely railway station. Tuberculosis (TB) gave John Keats a far from easeful death in 1821 but provided Violetta in 1853 with the best last act of all in La Traviata. And then these two captains of the men of death drifted away. Antibiotics cured them and left the theatre empty for the diseases of dirty air.",

The air became opaque with coal dust underground, while up above asbestos and other factory chemicals were inhaled, lingered in the lungs and slowly scarred them. New chapters were written into books of lung pathology, new X-ray patterns described. Asthma annoyed William of Orange and Charles Dickens but was never a 19th-century celebrity. However, 100 years later, with the help of Bill Clinton and David Beckham, it became a star; allergy replaced psychology as the cause, and big pharma smelt and dealt in gold. Sleep apnoea moved on from Dickens' fat boy snoring in the background to crest the wave of obesity and became the fastest growing branch of lung disease.",

He could feel chest movements and tap out different tones with elegant percussive fingers but had no idea of what was going on inside. He could smell anaerobes (new-mown hay with an arri ere gout of stale faeces), and he could wield a stethoscope as an instrument of erudition rather than understanding. His drug treatments were herbs e poppy, willow bark, stramonium, wormwood e and his surgical skills were few. TB was treated with rest, varying diets and lifestyle changes. Love and sex in particular had to be avoided e difficult as in sanatoria there was little else to do. Acute infections and fevers were cupped, bled or scarified, partly in order to remove bad humours and partly to structure time while waiting for nature to kill or cure. Did the doctor do more harm than good? No one knew. Then came the age of scientific discovery. Three key advances were Pasteur's germ theory of disease, Roentgen's discovery of X-rays and Chadwick's linking of infection to poor living conditions. Pasteur used microscopy (microbes could be seen and classified) to explain diseases, Semmelweis insisted on hygiene e puerperal fever could be prevented by clean hands e John Snow mapped the epidemiology of cholera to a water tap, and Lister sprayed antiseptic. At least as important as any technical advance, although less glamorous, was Edwin Chadwick's report The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population (1842), leading to new public health laws. Study of lung physiology led to tests of function e Hutchinson's 1842 spirometer was the pathfinder.",

Asthma attacks responded to treatment, and with inhaled corticosteroids came long-term control.

Key steps were endotracheal intubation (1904), anaesthetic gases (chloroform 1847, halothane 1951), antisepsis (1870s), blood groups and safe transfusion (1901), antibiotics (1940s) and, most important of all, brave pioneers. Each new operation builds on the experience of others; artificial pneumothorax (1830s) moved on to thoracoplasty (1880s) and plombage (1920s). The first survival from pneumonectomy was in 1931; the next 16 patients died. Eventually, surgery for TB turned into lung cancer resection in the 1950s. Drainage of pleural fluid was routine from 1850 (Axel Munthe describes draining an empyema in a pet ape during a home visit in The Story of San Michele in 1929). Thoracoscopy started in 1910 and advanced in the 1970s with fibreoptics. It has since developed into video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for investigation of pleural disease, lung biopsy, treatment of pneumothorax and simple resections. Lung transplantation opened new and wonderful prospects for end-stage lung disease with the first successful operations in the 1970s, and has now become routine, albeit limited by scarcity of donor organs.",

General physicians looked down on chest physicians ('Chest e yes, physician e never') before the systems were integrated in the 1960s. Today, the lung specialist is often the best general physician. TB nurses morphed, after a brief spell in the wilderness, into respiratory nurses with their own training programmes.
