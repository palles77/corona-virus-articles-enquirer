This review explores the possible mechanisms by which infections induce NCDs citing examples of studies in Africa and elsewhere where NCDs and infections are proposed or confirmed to be causally linked and also discusses the implications and challenges of these observations for science and medicine. The need to re-evaluate and expand early community and individual preventive and control strategies that will lead to reduction and even elimination of NCDs especially in Africa and other developing countries where infections are prevalent is highlighted.",

            "text": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the commonest cause of death and disability worldwide, accounting for almost 60% of all deaths with incidence rates assuming epidemic proportions in many countries of the world [1] . Eighty percent of deaths from NCDs occur in low and middle income countries of the developing world [1] and if nothing is done to halt this trend it is projected that by 2015 deaths from NCDs may increase by 15-27% in these countries [2] . The aetiology of most NCDs has been linked to multiple risk factors including host genetics and immune response, lifestyle and environmental risk factors [3] . Risk factors are defined as any attribute, characteristic or exposure of an individual, which increase the likelihood of developing a disease or injury [4] . Physical inactivity, alcohol excess, tobacco ingestion, excessive salt ingestion, gender, age, obesity, high cholesterol and unhealthy diet and many other factors are established conventional risk factors for development of many NCDs (Table 1 ) and they remain targets for NCD preventive and control strategies [3, 4] . Over the last two decades however, there has been an emergence of novel aetiological factors (e.g. Helicobacter Pylori and peptic ulcer disease (PUD) [5] ), novel risk factors (e.g. low birth weight and Type II Diabetes mellitus [6] ) and novel markers (e.g. raised Homocysteine and cardiovascular diseases [7] ) for many NCDs. NCDs causation can now be conceptualized as a continuum from womb to disability or death. A successful and durable NCDs preventive and control strategy therefore requires a holistic approach where all possible primary and secondary risk factors are targeted.",

Consequently, virulent strains produce products such as the cytotoxin associated gene-pathogenicity island (cag-PAI) products, vacoulating cytotoxin (VacA) and urease which act together with a dysregulated host immune response to promote gastric inflammation and cause PUD [5] . Similarly, of the about 30 genotypes of human papilloma virus (HPV) that cause genital infection strains with genotypes 16 and 18 are known to induce cervical cancer attributable to their potent oncogenic properties [18] . Other strain-specific disease outcomes can be seen in group A\u02c7hemolytic streptococcus-related acute glomerulonephritis where M strains types 1, 2, 4, 12, 18, 25, 49, 55, 57 and 60 are more likely to cause acute glomerulonephritis [19] and malaria where Plasmodium malariae is more likely than other species to cause immune complex mediated malaria nephropathy [20, 21] . The mechanisms that underlie how specific strains of an infection cause NCD is related to their ability to release cytotoxic products and also to cause an exaggerated and dysregulated immune response that leads to tissue damage.",

This analogy is typified in the hygiene hypothesis proposed by Strachan in 1989 [23] which states that an excessively hygienic environment in early childhood may predispose some towards asthma, allergy, atopy and autoimmune diseases. Early microbial exposure is essential for normal immune development [24] . Under excessively hygienic circumstances, early childhood infections are rare and the TH (T helper) 2 cytokines arm of the T helper lymphocytes is preferentially stimulated without modulation from the TH1 cytokine arm. Hence, excessive activation of TH2 cytokine arm predisposes hygienic children to asthma and allergy. In Africa, the low incidence of autoimmune and allergic diseases have been attributed to chronic malarial parasitaemia and recurrent helminthes infestation both of which induce immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory responses that prevent allergy and autoimmune diseases [17, 24] . In a pioneering experiment by Greenwood and Voller, infection of New Zealand Black (NZB) and Fi hybrid mice with rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei yoeli suppressed the spontaneous autoimmune disease of mice of these two strains [25] . Uncritical acceptance of this hypothesis hygiene may however understate the importance of hygiene in prevention of infectious diseases. While discouraging excessive hygienic practices that eliminate the beneficial effects of surrounding microbial flora in a healthy primary immune response, effective hygienic practices that prevent clinical infection and promote healthy living should always be emphasized and promoted.",

Some acute infections may however result in NCD via the ''hit and run'' hypothesis [32] . This hypothesis suggest that an infection 'HITS' by triggering an NCD and 'RUNS' (becomes no longer present) when the disease develops. Typical examples of NCD where the ''hit and run'' hypothesis is thought to play a role include Reiter's arthritis and other reactive arthritides that follow a past gastrointestinal infection (e.g. Campylobacter, Shigella) and genital infections (e.g. Chlamydia urethritis) [28] , and also multiple sclerosis that has been postulated to be triggered by childhood corona virus infections in predisposed individuals [32, 33] .",

An inherited germ-line mutation of the tumor suppressor gene can only result in cancer if there is a mutation of the second allele of the tumor suppressor gene [42] .

            "text": "1. Oncogene activation. Oncogenes are genes that promote cellular growth. Infectious may activate normal cellular oncogenes or may themselves express oncogenes that accelerate cell growth and result in malignancy. In the development of HBV-related primary liver cell carcinoma (PLCC), the X-protein of the virus has been postulated to directly transactivate viral genes and cellular oncogenes that promote HBV replication and also encourage tumorige-nesis [43, 44] . In HPV-related cervical cancers the E5 gene of the virus is an oncogene that activates growth factors promoting carcinogenesis [18, 45] . In the aetiopathogenesis of adult T cell leukaemia, Human T lymphotrophic virus 1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein is an oncogene protein which activates the transcriptional factor nuclear factor \u2424 (NF-\u2424) that promotes T cell transformation to cancers [46] . In the same vein, Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is known to induce chromosomal translocations (involving chromosomes 8; 14, or 2; 8, or 8; 22) that cause deregulation of the c-myc cellular oncogene expression and subsequent development of Burkitt's lymphoma [47] . Furthermore, the latent membrane protein 1(LMP1) and Epstein Barr nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) are oncogene products of EBV implicated in the tumorigenesis of Hodgkin's lymphoma and other EBV-related non-Hodgkin's lymphomas [47] . These and several other EBV oncogene products have also been linked to the aetiopathogenesis of a number of cancers including nasopharyngeal cancers [47] . 2. Loss of tumor suppressor ability. The p53 gene and the Retinoblastoma (pRb) gene code for anti-proliferative signals that suppress cancer development by inhibiting cell division, inducing programmed cell death (also known as apoptosis) and providing the opportunity for DNA repair during a cell cycle [42] . These tumor suppressor genes may become inactivated following an infection. The E6 and E7 gene products of HPV for instance, directly promote abnormal cellular growth that result in cervical cancers by degrading the p53 protein and inactivating the pRb protein, respectively [10, 45] . Aflatoxins produced from the fungus Aspergillus flavus have also been shown to cause a mutation in codon 249 of the p53 gene and is thought to act synergistically with HBV infection in promoting development of PLCC [48, 49] . In Zaria, northern Nigeria, aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, G2 have been found in liver cancer tissue as well as sera of patients with PLCC [50, 51] . 3. Chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation with repeated cycles of cell death and regeneration, release of oxygen free radicals and reactive nitrogen radicals lead to DNA damage and mutations. With every subsequent mutation the risk of carcinogenesis is increased. Chronic inflammation contributes to carcinogenesis in HCV/HBV-related PLCC [39, 40] and Schistosoma haematobium-related bladder cancers [52] since infection with these agents is characterized by repeated cycles of cell necrosis and regeneration.",

Human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) encodes a viral interleukin 6 (v-IL-6) and viral G-protein coupled receptor (v-GPCR) both possess pro-inflammatory, pro-growth factors and pro-angiogenic properties [53] . 4. Epithelial metaplasia. Infections like other carcinogens can directly cause cancers by provoking metaplasia of epithelial surfaces. This is exemplified in Helicobacter pylori-related gastric cancers where chronic atrophic gastritis results in intestinal metaplasia of the gastric mucosa with a consequent cellular dysplasia and cancer development [5] . Chronic Schistosoma haematobium infection also promotes development of squamous carcinoma of the bladder by inducing squamous metaplasia of the transitional epithelium of the bladder [52] . 5. Release of carcinogens. Infections may also cause release of carcinogens thereby promoting carcinogenesis. In chronic schistosomiasis and liver fluke (e.g. Chlonorchis sinesis) infestation, chronic inflammation may result in release of endogenous nitrosamines and exposure to high concentrations of this carcinogen may lead to neoplastic transformation [52] . Adult schistosome and miracidia may also directly liberate carcinogenic amines in the urine and by causing urinary stasis also concentrate urinary endogenous carcinogens. Absorption of these carcinogens may damage the bladder epithelium and promote carcinogenesis [52] . 6. Immunosuppression with loss of immunosurveillance. Infections such as HIV that cause predominant cellular immunosuppression are characteristically associated with increased risk of cancers. HIV infection results in both numerical and functional defects in both CD4 and CD8 T cells, cause dysfunctional natural killer (NK) cell, interferon gamma (INF-\u2425) and IL-2 activities and generally provoke an unfavourable TH2 biased cytokine dysregulation [54] . The TH1 cytokines (INF-\u2425, IL-2), natural killer cells (NK cells) and both CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes are important elements involved in tumor immunity and tumor surveillance [55] . These defects therefore predispose HIV patients to cancers including Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cervical cancers, Kaposi's sarcoma and other cancers [56] . Malaria induced immunosuppression and polyclonal B cell activation is also thought to encourage EBV transactivation and transformation of B cells characteristic of Burkiitt's lymphoma [57] . The roles of HIV or chronic malaria in triggering lymphomas when associated with EBV infection have also been linked to their ability to stimulate a TH2 B cell growth promoting cytokine profile and suppression of the TH1 tumor protective cytokines [58] .",

Infections such as malaria, urinary tract infections (UTI) and Toxoplasmosis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus and Herpes virus infections are all known causes of fetal malnutrition and intrauterine growth retardation [60, 61] especially in developing countries where these infections are prevalent. In Africa, malaria in pregnancy is a leading cause of fetal malnutrition and IUGR [60] . By directly causing fetal malnutrition, infections can indirectly serve as risk factors in the eventual development of NCD like Type 2 DM, hypertension, obesity and ischemic heart disease in genetically predisposed individuals.

Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy has also been ascribed to Coxsackie B virus and Toxoplasma gondii from serological studies in Africa [64] . Endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) akin to Loeffler's eosinophilic endocarditis in western world is another cardiomyopathy prevalent in developing countries. Jaiyesimi [74] and Andy et al. [75, 76] in Nigeria have described EMF as a burnt out phase of helminth-induced hypereosinophilia. Microfiliaria, Trichinella Spirallis, Ascaris Hookworm, Schistoso- miasis, Giardia Lamblia and Fascioliasis have been reported to be possible triggers for eosinophilia. Eosinophils induce EMF probably through the release of eosinophil basic proteins which are highly toxic to the endothelia and muscles of the heart, blood vessels and other organs [75, 76] .",

[85] observed that human adenovirus type 36 (Ad-36) experimentally induced obesity and paradoxically low levels of serum cholesterol and triglycerides in mice. A role of adenovirus in human obesity was suggested by a study in India where significantly higher prevalence rate of Ad-36 antibodies was reported in the obese humans when compared to non-obese (30% vs. 5%) [85] . Adenoviruses are thought to induce obesity by causing long-term hyperplasia and hyperproliferation of adipocytes [85] . It should be noted however that while the viral-associated obesity in animals has met Koch's criteria for causation, in human, infections are risk factors for obesity requiring concrete causal establishment.",

While infections have no established role in hypertensive and diabetic-related nephropathy, they are often the major aetiological drivers for glomerulonephritis particularly in developing countries where infections are highly prevalent [99, 100] . Infections can also result in kidney diseases by directly or indirectly damaging the renal parenchyma and interstitium [100] . In the entity named Tropical nephropathy, many infections have been shown to cause renal disease by invasion of the kidney/urinary tract (e.g. schistosomiasis, tuberculosis, leprosy), by direct renal injury (e.g. Salmonella) and by immune-mediated renal damage (e.g. Plasmodium spp., HBV, HCV, Yersinia enterolytica an\u010f hemolytic streptococcus) [99, 100] . Perhaps the earliest and the most remarkable example of how infections can result in renal disease is the Gilles and Hendrichse [101] 1963 account of Nephrosis in Nigerian children attributed to Plasmodium malariae. In a large study amongst adults and children in Uganda, Kibukamusoke et al. [102] in 1967, established a cause and effect relationship between Plasmodium malariae and nephrotic syndrome. This condition now called quartan malarial nephropathy is due to immune complex mediated damage of the kidney [21] .",

Malaria kills a child in Africa every 30 s and according to the WHO malaria causes 1.5-2 million deaths amongst children annually and 90% of these deaths occur in Africa [109] . In other to survive these attacks of malaria, a protective genetic mutation is thought to have been induced by an evolutionary pressure of malaria on the red cell genes of affected populations conferring recipients with survival and reproductive advantage over others [109] [110] [111] [112] . The evolutionary relationship between malaria and sickle hemoglobin is supported by striking coincidences in their geographical distribution [112] . By impairing malarial growth and development, the sickle cell trait (heterozygotes, AS) gives survival advantage over people with normal hemoglobin (AA) in malaria endemic regions [110] . Unfortunately individuals with homozygous state (SS) genetic red cell defects fail to attain survival advantage as they are more likely to have recurrent and severe attacks of malaria most often leading to death. This process by which the heterozygote of two alleles of a gene has an advantage over either of the homozygous states is called balanced polymorphism.",

As evidence gathers for a primary or precipitating role of infections in many NCDs, there is a need to re-design NCD control and preventive strategies to also include infection control while continuing to recognize NCD aetiopathogenesis as spread over a continuum. This review has brought to light the high incidences of various infections in the developing world and the contributory role of infections in programming, initiating, precipitating and promoting the development of NCDs. Consequently, an effective NCDs prevention can only be achieved in developing countries if infection controls is integrated with control of other environmental risk factors (Fig. 1) . Understanding that infections can contribute to NCD causation from fetal life to adulthood, emphasizes the need to also include prevention of infection in pregnancy (particularly malaria) and prevention of childhood infections (by routine immunization) as integral elements of NCDs control strategy in the developing world.",

Inadequate coverage is usually attributed to insufficient supply or absence of vaccines, difficult to reach terrains within communities and rejection of vaccines due to religious/cultural beliefs and illit- eracy. There are also problems of high cost of local production of vaccines, lack of knowledge of local antigenic serotypes for many infections and scarcity of the required expertise and technology needed for vaccine development in developing countries. Policy makers in this part of the world must therefore be prepared to re-organize and strengthen their vaccination programmes and also tackle problems confronting provision of effective vaccination.

To successfully identify whether any infection is a risk factor or primary aetiological factor for a NCD, there is a need for collaborative efforts between public health physicians, clinicians, pathologist and molecular biologist. This collaboration should be aimed at identifying NCD epidemiological trends, clinical manifestations and disease pathologies in relation to exposure to specific infections. Since not all infections are cultivatable, the role of the molecular biologist is to detect using molecular biotechnology, microbial ''finger prints'' (such as microbial DNA, RNA or protein) which when detected may further strengthen the evidence suggesting a link between an infection and a NCD. A surveillance network made of all these stakeholders is therefore very necessary and most be strengthened in developing countries. It should be emphasized that there is a need for all developing countries to make conscious efforts at implementing the WHO stepwise NCD surveillance approach [4] while recognizing the need to also include infectious risk factors in NCDs where infections have strong causal links. Perhaps, one of the greatest challenges in this regard, is the absence of adequate expertise and technology needed for detection of microbial fingerprints by molecular biotechnology. Governmental and NGO within developing countries most therefore take the responsibility of funding the research, training and technology required for molecular diagnosis.",
