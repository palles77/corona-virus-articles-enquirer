In a follow up study, we hypothesized that OMZ generates pro-resolving lipoxins being paralleled by production of immune-modulating prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and anti-inflammatory 15(S)hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid [15(S)-HETE] and depletion of pro-inflammatory leukotriene B4 (LTB 4 ). Human neutrophils (PMN) were chosen as the cellular system. The effect of OMZ on these parameters as well as on respiratory burst activity and oxidative stress marker 8-isprostane was analyzed in unstimulated and co-stimulated PMN by ultrafine carbon particles (UCP) or opsonized zymosan (OZ), respectively. In unstimulated cells, OMZ induced formation of PGE 2 , 15(S)-HETE, and LXA4. The levels of LTB4 and 8-isoprostane were not affected, whereas respiratory burst activity was drastically inhibited. In UCP-and OZ-stimulated control cells, all parameters were elevated. Here, OMZ maintained the increased levels of PGE 2 , 15(S)-HETE, and LXA4, but substantially suppressed levels of LTB4 and 8-isoprostane and inhibited the respiratory burst activity. These findings suggest a switch from the pro-inflammatory eicosanoid class LTB 4 to the pro-resolving LXA 4 . Since LXA 4 is most relevant in returning inflamed tissue to homeostasis, OMZ is postulated to terminate rhinitis-related inflammation, thus contributing to shortening of disease duration.",

            "text": "T\u00fcttenberg et al. (18) showed that the anti-inflammatory action of OMZ is partially mediated by the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8) as well as reduced T-cell stimulatory capacity of dendritic cells, resulting in a repressed stimulation of T cells. Westerveld et al. (17) showed that OMZ is a potent inhibitor of microsomal lipid peroxidation and a hydroxyl radical scavenger. Furthermore, we have recently reported that OMZ exhibits anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties in a cell-free system as well as in a cellular system consisting of canine alveolar macrophages (AM) (16) . OMZ was found to clearly inhibit pro-inflammatory reactions such as the respiratory burst and the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway with formation of leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4 ). Besides, this drug had the capability to induce the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway for formation of immune-modulating prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) and the 15-lipoxygenase pathway for production of anti-inflammatory 15(S)-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid [15(S)-HETE]. These protective processes are known to trigger pathways involving the resolution of inflammation. The resolution of inflammation is an active process with formation of so called \"stop signals\" such as the newly discovered anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving dual function mediators lipoxin A 4 (LXA 4 ) and lipoxin B 4 (LXB 4 ) (19) .",

The resolution phase of inflammation is an important event to return the inflamed tissue to homeostasis and to complete resolution without leaving molecular signs or traces of the leukocyte battle (19) . Otherwise chronic inflammatory processes may occur. Because infections by rhinoviruses induce inflammatory reactions with influx of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) into the nasal tissue (20, 21) , these cells serve as a model in this study with OMZ. We suggest that OMZ is able to induce immune-modulating PGE 2 and antiinflammatory 15-HETE and to inhibit pro-inflammatory LTB 4 . Due to the activation and inhibition of these lipid mediators and their corresponding enzymes, a switch of eicosanoids may occur by OMZ, resulting in inhibition of 5-LO with LTB 4 formation and in activation of PGE 2 synthesis and 15(S)-HETE generation, leading to production of pro-resolving LXA 4 .",

The following treatments were performed according to our previous study (16) : i) to assess the effect of OMZ on unstimulated cells, PMN (0.5 \u00d7 10 6 cells/0.5 ml) were incubated with various concentrations of OMZ (0.1, 0.4, and 1 mM, corresponding to 29.68, 118.72, and 296.8 \u03bcg/ml, respectively) in PBS, pH 7.4, with Ca 2+ / Mg 2+ and 0.1% glucose for 80 min at 37\u00b0C; ii) to measure the effect of OMZ on stimulated cells, PMN (0.5 \u00d7 10 6 cells /0.5 ml) were incubated in parallel incubations with various concentrations of OMZ (0.1, 0.4, and 1 mM) in PBS, pH 7.4, with Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ and 0.1% glucose for 20 min at 37\u00b0C and subsequently co-stimulated by UCP (32 \u03bcg/ ml) or OZ (50 \u03bcg/ml) for an additional 60 min. After the incubation procedures, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 400 \u00d7 g for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were resuspended in cold HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM EDTA; homogenized by sonification (3 times, 15 s each time) in ice; and centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. Importantly, cells were kept on ice during preparation to avoid activation or degradation processes. The supernatants were taken for analysis of both protein and lipid mediators. Analysis of the lysate is a reliable tool to quantify the eicosanoid production that has to be favored over analysis of extracellular levels (26) . The sensitivity of this intracellular approach is supported by normalization of eicosanoid levels to the protein content in the lysate. Analysis of the cellular eicosanoid content appears to be relevant with regard to the autocrine mechanisms of PGE 2 , which might trigger both functional and metabolic parameters of PMN.",

            "text": "In a previous study we showed in an in vitro assay that OMZ inhibits the activity of 5-LO, which has pro-inflammatory properties. The activity of 15-LO, showing anti-inflammatory characteristics, is not inhibited. Using canine alveolar macrophages as a cellular model, we recently confirmed that OMZ inhibits the 5-LO pathway, causing a decreased production of LTB 4 , and it induces the 15-LO pathway, resulting in an increase of 15(S)-HETE generation (16) . The present study was designed to investigate the effect of OMZ on the eicosanoid metabolism in human PMN representing the major population of inflammatory cells in the virus-infected nasal tissue (20, 21) . Based on our observation that OMZ activates the 15-LO pathway, we postulated that OMZ also induces formation of proresolving lipoxins, being the final metabolites of this pathway. These studies were performed both with unstimulated PMN and PMN stimulated by UCP or OZ to simulate inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. Our data demonstrate that OMZ inhibits respiratory burst activity very efficiently, while baseline levels of LTB 4 and 8-isoprostane used as an oxidative stress marker are not affected in unstimulated PMN. However, immune-modulating and anti-inflammatory responses, including the PGE 2 and 15(S)-HETE and the proresolving mediator LXA 4 production, are significantly increased. In UCP-or OZ-stimulated cells, OMZ strongly inhibits the LTB 4 and 8-isoprostane formation and the respiratory burst activity. The increased levels of PGE 2 , 15(S)-HETE, and LXA 4 reached after stimulation were maintained in the presence of OMZ. We suppose that UCP-and OZ-stimulated cells are at their upper limit for producing PGE 2 , 15(S)-HETE, and LXA 4 , which does not allow a further increase by OMZ under these in vitro conditions. Similar responses regarding PGE 2 , 15(S)-HETE, LTB 4 , respiratory burst activity, and 8-isoprostane were already observed in canine AM (16) , which react very similar to human AM (23) . The effective concentrations of OMZ for inhibition of proinflammatory and oxidative stress reactions in PMN range between 0.1 and 1 mM. These OMZ concentrations have also been shown to be relevant in AM (16) . In our previous study we estimated that OMZ in the current product concentration of 1.6 mM (nose sprays for adults and school children) at a dosage volume of 45 \u03bcl/puff (28) will be diluted to form a concentration gradient that is in the range of the levels of OMZ used in our experiments (estimated mean value: almost equal to 0.1 mM) (16) . Therefore, our present results are of relevance in situ. However, it is still unknown by which receptor(s) OMZ modulates inflammation. Possibly OMZ exerts its effects on lipid mediators via \u03b1 1 -and/or \u03b1 2 -adrenoceptors since studies with stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have shown that OMZ behaves as a partial agonist of \u03b1 1A -adrenoceptors (29, 30) , and this was also observed for \u03b1 2C -adrenoceptors (31) . In addition, very low or not precisely measurable agonistic activity of OMZ has been observed in transfected CHO cells expressing \u03b1 1D - (29, 30) or \u03b1 2A -(32) adrenoceptors.",

            "text": "Data from our in vitro approach demonstrate that OMZ inhibits the 5-LO-driven production of LTB 4 and the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is paralleled by a substantial increase of PGE 2 . Besides having some specific pro-inflammatory properties, PGE 2 was shown in the last decade to exhibit predominantly a regulatory function to control immune responses, for example, by attenuating pro-inflammatory reactions (36) . One important target of this cyclooxygenase metabolite is the 5-LO-driven pathway, which is inhibited for leukotriene synthesis and translocation of 5-LO in stimulated PMN (37, 38) . Furthermore, PGE 2 was found to up-regulate the expression of 15-LO in PMN (39) , which activates the pathway for generation of 15(S)-HETE and lipoxins. Exposure of PMN to 15(S)-HETE also attenuates levels of LTB 4 substantially after stimulation with Ca 2+ -ionophore or the FMLP peptide (40) . Up-regulation of 15-LO expression and release of 15(S)-HETE seem to be a further regulatory mechanism to cope with inflammation (41, 42) . There is evidence that 15-LO is expressed in human nasal epithelium to mediate mucociliary differentiation (43) . The expression of 15-LO in nasal epithelium may further support our findings about the effect of OMZ on 15(S)-HETE formation in PMN. 15(S)-HETE is the key metabolite for generation of lipoxins that also involves the action of 5-LO. Lipoxins are primarily engaged in resolution and termination of inflammatory events that return the inflamed tissue to homeostasis. Although PGE 2 initiates a number of responses relevant to inflammation, the central task of this metabolite is to trigger the \"lipid mediator class switching\" to signal the end of inflammation by activating the transcriptional regulation of 15-LO, resulting in production of LXA 4 (19, 39) . Since OMZ induces formation of PGE 2 and 15(S)-HETE indicating an activation of 15-LO and reduces LTB 4 production indicating a reduction of 5-LO activity, OMZ is suggested to substantially support this switching of the eicosanoid class from LTB 4 to LXA 4 . The importance of PGE 2 induced by OMZ during the inflammatory response in the nasal tissue is emphasized by the study of Han et al. (44) , showing that the nasal patency is reduced when the COX activity is inhibited by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Moreover, the respiratory burst activity and the oxidative stress induced by UCP and OZ are inhibited by OMZ. The inhibition of both parameters might be due to the radical scavenger activity of OMZ as proposed by Westerveld et al. (17) . OMZ contains a hydroxyl group on its phenyl ring that is able to easily provide a hydrogen atom for reaction with lipid peroxide-related radicals and other reactive oxygen species. Due to its radical scavenger activity, we suggest that OMZ also neutralizes radicals arising from the respiratory burst activity and abolishes UCP-and OZ-induced 8isoprostane formation. This represents a protective mechanism avoiding excessive release of reactive (16) , OMZ interferes with neutrophil membranes by activating cytoplasmatic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), which liberates arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. Arachidonic acid is further metabolized to immune-modulating PGE2 by cyclooxygenase (COX) and to anti-inflammatory acting 15(S)-HETE by 15-lipoxygenase . In contrast to PGE2 and 15(S)-HETE, OMZ inhibits 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), the initial enzyme of leukotriene synthesis, resulting in reduced production of pro-inflammatory LTB4. Furthermore, OMZ inhibits respiratory burst activity (NADPH oxidase), leading to diminished production of tissue-damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus intensifying its inhibitory effect on pro-inflammatory reactions. In the presence of environmental or physiologic stimuli such as ultrafine carbon particles (UCP) or opsonized zymosan (OZ), OMZ also inhibits LTB4 synthesis and respiratory burst activity, whereas PGE2 and 15(S)-HETE production are not affected. In addition, OMZ prevents the formation of the oxidative stress marker 8-isoprostane, which is induced by the oxidative capacity of environmental particles and opsonized zymosan. Due to its inhibition of LTB4 formation and induction of PGE2 and 15(S)-HETE production, OMZ is able to switch the eicosanoid classes from pro-inflammatory LTB4 to proresolving LXA4. This highlights the anti-inflammatory and proresolving role of OMZ in rhinitis.",

Baseline levels were obtained by parallel incubations of the cells without OMZ. The effect of OMZ was measured for (a) generation of immunemodulating PGE2, anti-inflammatory 15(S)-HETE, and pro-resolving mediator LXA4 and (b) production of pro-inflammatory LTB4, CL as indicator for respiratory burst activity, and formation of 8isoprostane as oxidative stress marker.
