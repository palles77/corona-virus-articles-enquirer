Postgraduate year-1 (PGY 1 ) residents are main members to take care of patients in the medical system. In order to train PGY 1 resident, we should construct a training program for clinical teacher to help them familiar with ACGME competencies. Our study aims to assess the effectiveness of \"training program of ACGME competencies for clinical teacher\". Methods: During 2009 and 2010 years, we trained 134 clinical teachers to teach and train PGY 1 residents about ACGME competencies. Results: The participants of our training program reported that the most teaching skills that they used in teaching were learnt from circuit and itinerant bedside, physical examination (PE) teaching demonstration, lectures and video watching of \"how to teach ACGME Competencies?\". Participants reported that circuit bedside teaching demonstration mainly train the teaching skills of participants for the interpersonal and communication skills (ICS) domain; itinerant teaching demonstration mainly teach the participants the teaching skills of professionalism (P) domain. Both lectures of training camp and video watching for \"how to teach ACGME competencies?\" increase the familiarity of participants to train and teach PGY 1 resident about ACGME competencies. Participants came from internal medicine departments; longer years as the attending physical and having the experience of PGY 1 clinical teachers applied the most teaching skills learnt from training program on their teaching. Conclusions: Our study suggested that ACGME competencies-based \"training program of ACGME competencies for clinical teacher\" were effectively established the training and teaching skills of clinical teachers for PGY 1 residents.",

A project entitled the \"Postgraduate General Medical Training Program\" was further announced by the DOH in August 2003. In this project, each PGY 1 resident is required to complete a six-month training program before entering his or her subspecialist courses. 2 In 2006, Taiwan Association of Medical Education helped many teaching hospitals to establish \"General Medical Training Demonstration Centers\" as a means of improving medical education of clinical teachers, residents, and medical students. Additionally, the DOH arranged to extend the current six-month postgraduate general medicine training program to a one-year program, in which all PGY 1 residents receive one year of holistic health care-centered training. 3 After 2009, the DOH added a \"Training Program for Clinical Instructors\" to the \"General Medical Training\" program to prepare the clinical instructors needed to train more than 1300 PGY 1 residents every year in one-year PGY 1 programs. 5 6 The goal of the Training Program for Clinical Instructors is to help teaching hospitals implementing the \"General Medical Training Demonstration Center\" program to train clinical instructors who have the ability to teach ACGME core competencies, including medical knowledge, interpersonal and communication skills, system-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and patient care for PGY 1 residents (http: //www.acgme.org). 7 Taipei Veterans General Hospital (VGH) is a regional medical center providing primary and tertiary care to active-duty and retired military personnel and their dependents, and is the primary teaching hospital for its general medicine residency program.",

Recognizing that the language of the competencies is rather general, we encouraged participants to use their judgment when deciding whether a particular teaching activity provided training in one or more area ( Table 2 ). The questionnaires were filled out after participants completed the basic 40-hour training course, training workshops, and video instruction. To assess the degree of application of skills learned from different activities, respondents were asked to fill out a follow-up questionnaire three months after completion the training course. In the questionnaires, participants were requested to rate the frequency of their application of competencies using a five-point scale [1: always (100% of their teaching time), 2: frequently (75-100% of their teaching time), 3 : often (50-75% of their teaching time), 4: occasionally (25-50% of their teaching time), 5: rarely (0-25% of their teaching time)].",

However, participants did not agree strongly that they should learn ACGME competencies. This is probably due to the fact that clinical teachers considered that the ACGME competencies taught in our program did not meet social expectations very well. 12, 13 In addition, most participants agreed that they were particularly familiar with the assessment of domains of patient care, interpersonal and communication skills, and medical knowledge after the 40-hour training program. Taken together, the training program mainly improved the attitudes, familiarity and training abilities in the three domains. In other words, participants did not acquire the instructional skills in the domains of system-based practice, problem-based learning, and improvement, and professionalism very well after 40-hour basal training course. It can be seen from Table 4 that the participants' familiarity on teaching and assessment of PGY 1 residents' system-based practice (SBP) and problem-based learning and improvement (BPLI) domains was mainly improved by CbD teaching demonstrations. Further, clinical teacher' familiarity to teach and assess PGY 1 residents' professionalism domain was chiefly improved by itinerant bedside teaching demonstrations. Accordingly, the program directors in the General Medicine Training Demonstration Center should consider extending the essential hours of CbD and itinerant bedside teaching demonstrations. This change might improve the effectiveness the program to train participants' instructional skills in SBP, PBLI, and professionalism domains. 14 On the other hand, we also observed that clinical teacher' familiarity and teaching ability on PGY 1 residents' SBP and PBLI domains were improved significantly after post-course training workshops and video watching of \"how to teach competencies\" (Fig 2 and 3) . However, training workshops and video watching did not effectively improve participants' teaching ability in professionalism domain.",

Previous studies had suggested that video watching consistently enhances trainees' observational powers, improves their ability to integrate different information, and motivates them to learn. 6 16 17 18 Another strategy is therefore to make up for the lack of training in the domains of SBP, PBLI, and professionalism by increasing the hours of post-course video watching in the future. Table 3 shows that participants chiefly learned instructional skills through circuit bedsides, PE, itinerant teaching demonstrations, post-course workshop and video watching of \"how to teach competencies\". Moreover, the increase in frequency of competency instructional skills application was mainly attributable to itinerant and circuit bedsides, PE teaching demonstrations, post-course workshop and video watching. Conversely, the participants rarely used instructional skills learned from CbD teaching concerning teaching and assessment skills in the domains of SBP and PBLI. The lack of application of CbD instructional skills might have been caused by the low familiarity with CbD instructional skills after completion of the program. This study had several limitations. First, the questionnaire used to track and assess the effectiveness of the training program may have had information and recall bias. The effectiveness of training should therefore be assessed immediately after each individual teaching activity demonstration by persons other than the program directors. 8 In addition, this study had a small sample size and did not contain a control group. There are as yet no controlled educational trials on this subject. 16 Finally, this study had a short follow-up period. As a result, the study's findings may represent only short-term changes in attitude, familiarity, and teaching skills. 10 Despite these limitations, the present study confirmed the effectiveness of the Competency Training Program for Clinical Teachers designed and organized by the VGH educational committee. To date, there are no well-established standards that specifically address the competency teaching and assessment skills of clinical teachers. 4",

A project entitled the \"Postgraduate General Medical Training Program\" was further announced by the DOH in August 2003. In this project, each PGY 1 resident is required to complete a six-month training program before entering his or her subspecialist courses. 2 In 2006, Taiwan Association of Medical Education helped many teaching hospitals to establish \"General Medical Training Demonstration Centers\" as a means of improving medical education of clinical teachers, residents, and medical students. Additionally, the DOH arranged to extend the current six-month postgraduate general medicine training program to a one-year program, in which all PGY 1 residents receive one year of holistic health care-centered training. 3 After 2009, the DOH added a \"Training Program for Clinical Instructors\" to the \"General Medical Training\" program to help prepare the clinical instructors needed to train more than 1300 PGY 1 residents every year during the one-year PGY 1 programs. 5 6 The goal of the Training Program for Clinical Instructors is to help teaching hospitals implementing the \"General Medical Training Demonstration Center\" program to train clinical instructors such that they have the ability to teach to PGY 1 residents the ACGME core competencies, including medical knowledge, interpersonal and communication skills, system-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and patient care (http: //www.acgme.org). 7 Taipei Veterans General Hospital (VGH) is a regional medical center providing primary and tertiary care to active-duty and retired military personnel and their dependents, and is the primary teaching hospital for its general medicine residency program.",

The post-course training camp for clinical teachers was held under the monitor of TAME. The lectures at training camp emphasized teaching skills related to the competencies and lasted at least 7 hours. The aims of training camp and video watching were to teach in issues associated with and allow discussion of the ACGME competence-related teaching and assessment skills.

Kirkpatrick has described four levels of training program outcomes that may be assessed. This first level is a measure of participants, initial reaction to the program. The second level is to assess the amount of knowledge and skill that participants learned, while the third level evaluates the amount of knowledge and skills learned that participants actually use in everyday work. The fourth level is an evaluation of the impact of the program on the institution and society.

[15] [16] Accordingly, the program directors in the General Medicine Training Demonstration Center should consider extending the hours allocated to itinerant bedside teaching demonstration, CbD evaluation demonstration, post-course training camp and video watching. These changes are likely to improve the effectiveness the program in term of participants' instructional skills in system-based practice, problem-based learning and improvement, and professionalism domains. 15 When compared with post-course training camp, video watching further increased the participants' familiarity with teaching and assessment skills in the domains of system-based practice, problem-based learning and improvement, and professionalism. Previous studies had suggested that video watching consistently enhances trainees' observational powers, improves their ability to integrate different information, and motivates them to learn. 6 17 18 19 Another strategy is therefore to make up for the lack of training in the domains of system-based practice, problem-based learning and improvement, and professionalism by increasing the hours of post-course 16 video watching in the future. Table 3 shows that participants chiefly learned instructional skills through circuit bedsides, PE, itinerant teaching demonstrations, post-course training camp and video watching. Moreover, the participants also response in the follow-up (3-months) questionnaires that the most skills that they applied in teaching had been mainly leant from itinerant and circuit bedsides, PE teaching demonstrations, post-course training camp and video watching. Conversely, the participants rarely used instructional skills learned from CbD evaluation demonstration. At the same time, our study suggested that CbD evaluation demonstration mainly establishes teaching and assessment skills in the domains of system-based practice, problem-based learning and improvement.",

Furthermore, in order to effectively validate the results of our faculty development program, a clear definition of the desirable teacher , s behaviors needs be given to participants in future works. The behaviors perhaps should include: create an appropriate learning climate; be learner-centered; facilitate participants, learning; encourage self-awareness through reflection; tailor teaching to participants , needs and wants, etc. suggested by Hewson et al. 10 Additionally, it is well-established that when one goes through an evaluation process, the evaluation process becomes more difficult and time-consuming as one moves from Kirkpatrick level 1 to level 4, 17 although higher level provides information that is of increasingly significant value than lower level. Thus, the level 4 needs to be assessed in the future for our program. 11 Tit should be noted that, as yet, no controlled educational trials on this subject have been published and this type of trail would be useful. 17 Finally, this study involved only a short follow-up period and a result, the study's findings may represent only short-term changes in attitude, familiarity, and teaching skills. 11 Despite these limitations, the present study confirms the effectiveness of \"the faculty development program about competency for clinical teachers\" designed and organized by the VGH educational committee. To date, there are no well-established standards that specifically address the competency teaching and assessment skills of clinical teachers. 4",

In this project, each PGY 1 resident is required to complete a six-month of holistic health care-centered training program before entering his or her subspecialist courses. 2 In 2006, Taiwan Association of Medical Education (TAME) helped many teaching hospitals to establish \"General Medical Training Demonstration Centers\" as means of improving medical education of clinical instructors, residents, and medical students. Additionally, the DOH arranged to extend the current six-month postgraduate general medicine training program to a one-year program. 3 After 2009, the DOH added a \"Training Program for Clinical Instructors\" to the \"General Medical Training\" program to help prepare the clinical instructors needed to train more than 1300 PGY 1 residents every year during the one-year PGY 1 programs. 5 6 The goal of the program is to help clinical instructors such that they have the ability to teach to PGY 1 residents the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competencies, including medical knowledge, interpersonal and communication skills, system-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and patient care (http: //www.acgme.org). 7 Taipei Veterans General Hospital (VGH) is a regional medical center providing primary and tertiary care to active-duty and retired military personnel and their dependents, and is the primary teaching hospital for its general medicine residency program.",

In general, the second part of training course is designed to re-enforce the efficiency of faculty development program. The post-course training workshop for clinical instructors was held under the monitor of TAME. The lectures at training workshop emphasized teaching skills related to the competencies and lasted at least 7 hours. The aims of training workshop and videotapes were to teach in issues associated with and allow discussion of the ACGME competence-related teaching and assessment skills. At the same time, we design portfolios for all participants to allow them to record and certify their training courses. Finally, TAME certificated their teaching ability according to the records within the portfolios. 11 The course can be implemented intermittently or continuously over period of three months. All participants had chances to demonstrate and practice the teaching and evaluation skills learned in the course. ",

Kirkpatrick has described four levels of training program outcomes that may be assessed. 14 This first level is a measure of participants, initial reaction to the program. The second level is to assess the amount of knowledge and skill that participants learned, while the third level evaluates the amount of knowledge and skills learned that participants actually use in everyday work. The fourth level is an evaluation of the impact of the program on the institution and society. It has been suggested that educational institutions should develop an institution-specific evaluation model to meet their particular needs including educational processes and outcomes.

In the first part of questionnaire, a five-item Likert scale was used to rate the degree of respondents' agreement with the teaching skills provided by different activities in the competency training program for clinical instructors. 9 In the second part, respondents were asked to indicate which of the corresponding six areas were learned in each of the structured activities of the training courses.

Previous studies had suggested that training videotapes consistently enhances trainees' observational powers, improves their ability to integrate different information, and motivates them to learn. 6 19 20 21 It is probably that our program director should increase the hours of post-course training workshop and videotapes session to improve training in the domains of system-based practice, problem-based learning and improvement, and professionalism in the future.

Conversely, participants answered that they rarely used instructional skills learned from CbD evaluation demonstration. At the same time, our study suggested that CbD evaluation demonstration mainly establishes teaching and assessment skills in the domains of system-based practice, problem-based learning and improvement. The lack of application of CbD instructional skills might have been resulted from participants , low familiarity with CbD instructional skills after completion of the program. Thus, the program directors should also consider extending the hours of CbD evaluation demonstration in future.",

Firstly, the questionnaire used to track and assess the participants , perception of the faculty development program may suffer Thirdly, according to the \"original\" definition, Kirkpatrick , s third level evaluates \"the amount of knowledge and skills learned that participants actually use in everyday work\". In our study, we modified the third level to be the \"self-reported degree of participants , application of skills leant from different teaching and training activities\". Furthermore, in order to effectively validate the results of our faculty development program, a clear definition of the desirable teacher , s behaviors needs be given to participants in future works. The behaviors perhaps should include: create an appropriate learning climate; be learner-centered; facilitate participants, learning; encourage self-awareness through reflection; tailor teaching to participants , needs and wants, etc. suggested by Hewson et al. 10 Additionally, it is well-established that when one goes through an evaluation process, the evaluation process becomes more difficult and time-consuming as one moves from Kirkpatrick level 1 to level 4, although higher level provides information that is of increasingly significant value than lower level. Thus, the level 4 needs to be assessed in the future for our program. 11, 14 It should be noted that, as yet, no controlled educational trials on this subject have been published and this type of trail would be useful. 19 Finally, this study involved only a short follow-up period and a result, the study's findings may represent only short-term changes in attitude, familiarity, and teaching skills. 11 Despite these limitations, the present study provide a survey about the participants , perception of the various training sessions of our \"faculty development program about competency for clinical instructors\" designed and organized by the Taipei VGH educational committee. To date, there are no well-established standards that specifically address the competency teaching and assessment skills of clinical instructors. 4",

In our study, we modified the third level to be the \"self-reported degree of participants , application of skills leant from different teaching and training activities\". Furthermore, in order to effectively validate the results of our faculty development program, a clear definition of the desirable teacher , s behaviors needs be given to participants in future works. The behaviors perhaps should include: create an appropriate learning climate; be learner-centered; facilitating participants, learning; encouraging self-awareness through reflection; tailor teaching to participants , needs and wants, etc. suggested by Hewson et al. 10 Additionally, it is well-established that when one goes through an evaluation process, the evaluation process becomes more difficult and time-consuming as one moves from Kirkpatrick level 1 to level 4, although higher level provides information that is of increasingly significant value than lower level. Thus, the level 4 needs to be assessed in the future for our program. 11, 14 It should be noted that, as yet, no controlled educational trials on this subject have been published and this type of trail would be useful. 19 Finally, this study involved only a short follow-up period and a result, the study's findings may represent only short-term changes in attitude, familiarity, and teaching skills. 11 Despite these limitations, the present study provides information about the participants , perception of the various training sessions of our \"faculty development program about competency for clinical instructors\" designed and organized by the Taipei VGH educational committee. To date, there are no well-established standards that specifically address the competency teaching and assessment skills of clinical instructors. 4",

Methods: During 2009 and 2010 years, 134 clinical instructors participated our program to establish their ability to teach and assess PGY 1 residents about ACGME competencies. Results: The participants in our faculty development program reported that the skills most often used while teaching were learnt during circuit and itinerant bedside, physical examination (PE) teaching, mini-CEX evaluation demonstration, training workshop and videotapes of \"how to teach ACGME competencies?\". Participants reported that circuit bedside teaching and mini-CEX evaluation demonstrations helped them in the interpersonal and communication skills domain; itinerant teaching demonstration helped them in professionalism domain, while PE teaching and mini-CEX evaluation demonstrations helped them in patients care domain. Both training workshop and videotapes increase the participants , familiarity with teaching and assessing skills of ACGME competencies of PGY 1 resident. Participants came from internal medicine departments; young attending physician and having the experience of PGY 1 clinical instructors applied the most skills learnt from faculty development program on their teaching and assessment. Conclusions: According to the clinical instructors , response, our faculty development program effectively increased their familiarity with various teaching and assessment skills for PGY 1 residents , ACGME competencies.

In this project, each PGY 1 resident is required to complete a six-month of holistic health care-centered training program before entering his or her subspecialist courses.2    In 2006, Taiwan Association of Medical Education (TAME) helped many teaching hospitals to establish \"General Medical Training Demonstration Centers\" as means of improving medical education of clinical instructors, residents, and medical students. Additionally, the DOH arranged to extend the current six-month postgraduate general medicine training program to a one-year program.3  After 2009, the DOH added a \"Training Program for Clinical Instructors\" to the \"General Medical",

All clinical instructors participated in the training course voluntarily.(A): The content of \"faculty development program of ACGME competencies for clinical instructors\" Overall, the design of the content of faculty development program by TAME was based on the coherent educational theory proposed by Hewson et al. 10 It has been suggested that the program should include videotapes, mini-lecture, group discussions, demonstrations, role plays, and simulated teaching experiences in order to promote a change in the attitudes, values, beliefs and assumptions about teaching of clinical instructors. 10 Accordingly, TAME announced that the faculty development program consisted of two parts, namely the ACGME competencies-based 40-hour basic clinical practice training course and a post-course training workshop together with a videotape session. In general, the second part of training course is designed to re-enforce the efficacy of the faculty development program. The post-course training workshop for clinical instructors was held under the monitor of TAME. The lectures at training workshop emphasized teaching skills related to the competencies and lasted at least 7 hours. The aims of training workshop and videotapes were to teach in issues associated with andallow discussion of the ACGME competence-related teaching and assessment skills.",

Three to four short video clips were produced for each patient, and demonstrated the application of competencies. The average length of these clips was two minutes. The first clip usually consisted of competency-based medical consultations demonstrated by a trained physician. Subsequent clips usually consisted of the patient's physical examination and follow-up medical consultations focusing on the discussion of investigation results and treatment options.

Additionally, only 1 male and 1 female clinical teacher among above 17 clinical instructors had the previous experience as a PGY 1 mentor and clinical instructor (2/17,12%). On the other hand, 2 females (1 from Surgery; 1 from Pediatrics) and 5 males (2 from Chest medicine; 1 from Rehabilization; 2 from Family Medicine) not complete the questionnaire and only 1 female among them (1/7, 14%) had experience as a PGY 1 mentor. Moreover, most of above clinical instructors (19/24, 79%) are came from other cooperating hospitals rather than Taipei VGH. In a retrospective interview by e-mail, most of them stated that their main reason for failing to complete the course was the time limit of 3-months. Thus it is probably that the complete rate of the program would be increased if the program did not insist that the participants \uf02c complete all course within three months.",
