However, other non-structural roles of NS4A protein in relation to virus life-cycle are poorly defined. This study elucidated if dengue virus (DENV) NS4A protein interacts with host proteins and contributes to viral pathogenesis by screening human liver cDNA yeasttwo-hybrid library. Our study identified polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) as a novel interacting partner of DENV NS4A protein. We reported for the first time that PTB influenced DENV production. Gene-silencing studies showed that PTB did not have an effect on DENV entry and DENV RNA translation. Further functional studies revealed that PTB influenced DENV production by modulating negative strand RNA synthesis. This is the first study that enlightens the interaction of DENV NS4A protein with PTB, in addition to demonstrating the novel role of PTB in relation to mosquito-borne flavivirus life-cycle.",

There are four DENV serotypes that are antigenically different, namely DENV1, DENV2, DENV3 and DENV4. Its RNA genome encodes a single polypeptide which is subsequently processed by virus and host proteases to form three structural and seven non-structural proteins in the order C-prM-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5 [1, 2] . The capsid protein undergoes oligomerization and interacts with viral RNA to form nucleocapsid. The pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins synthesized at endoplasmic reticulum form heterodimers and further interact with virus nucleocapsid to generate immature virus particles. The immature virus particles are transported through trans-Golgi network and cleaved by host protease furin to form infectious mature virus particles. Mature virions are subsequently released from the host cell by exocytosis [3, 4] .",

DENV infection causes a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic fever to potentially fatal hemorrhagic manifestations. Approximately 2.5 billion people living in tropical and subtropical countries are at risk of epidemic transmission and 50-100 million-dengue infections occur annually. About 500,000 dengue-infected individuals develop the life threatening Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever and Dengue Shock Syndrome [19, 20] . There is no approved vaccine or antiviral therapies available against DENV infections. The only form of treatment available today is the supportive treatment and prevention is through vector control and boosting the immunity. Hence there is a great urge for the development of vaccines or novel antivirals. Viruses are known to subvert host proteins to create a more favorable environment for their replication. It is thus important to understand the virus-host protein interactions that mediate different steps of DENV life cycle to develop good antiviral drugs.",

RNA viruses are known to replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells although Uchil and colleagues [37] reported that DENV replication occured within the nucleus. Moreover, several structural and non-structural proteins of flavivirus were shown to enter the nucleus and this nuclear phase is critical for their replication. Though PTB is present predominantly in the nucleus at static state, a significant cytoplasmic localization was also reported and it can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm [38, 39] . Thus the cellular distribution of PTB together with its interaction with a component of DENV replicative complex indicated that PTB can influence DENV production.",

This study identified that PTB binding to DENV RNA genome is crucial and reduced binding affected negative strand RNA synthesis which accounted for the altered DENV production in PTBKD cells (Fig. 4) . This is in consistent with Mouse Hepatitis virus where PTB influenced transcription, but not translation of viral RNA [40] . Recently, Davis and colleagues [18] showed that binding of elongation factor 1 alpha to West Nile virus RNA genome is critical for viral negative strand RNA synthesis. This suggested that PTB might play a similar role in DENV replication or PTB might function together with elongation factor 1 alpha to facilitate DENV negative strand RNA synthesis.",

NS4A protein was detected mainly in the perinuclear regions although nuclear staining was also observed to a lesser extent [Fig. 1B(vi)]. Yellow fluorescence observed with the overlay image [Fig. 1B(viii)] confirmed the co-localization of DENV NS4A protein with PTB in DENV-infected cells. This further demonstrated that the interaction between NS4A and PTB is genuine.",
