So far, 67 types, including candidates from HAdV-55 to HAdV-67, have been classified into seven species (A-G) according to their biophysical and biochemical properties and a new paradigm based on genomics. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Specific types have been linked to distinct clinical syndromes. Species B includes two genetic clusters, subspecies B1 and B2. B1 subspecies (including HAdV-3, HAdV-7, HAdV-16, HAdV-21, and HAdV-50) usually cause acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs), while B2 subspecies (including HAdV-11, HAdV-14, HAdV-34, and HAdV-35) are more often associated with urinary tract infections and opportunistic infections in immune-compromised hosts, except HAdV-14 (which is a respiratory pathogen). 2 Although HAdVs primarily cause diseases in young children, it has been reported repeatedly that these viruses also cause acute respiratory disease in adults. These infections usually occur as outbreaks in training facilities and are characterized by respiratory tract disease with extensive morbidity and occasional mortality.",

[3] [4] [5] HAdV-B55 is one of these, Objectives: To investigate the cause of an acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) outbreak. Methods: Thirty-eight clinical samples were collected from 19 patients in an ARTI outbreak that occurred in a physical training facility in January 2013; patient demographic information was also collected. In addition, 60 influenza virus-negative samples from febrile respiratory patients were collected from the same community at the same time to determine whether these were the same infections. Multiplex PCR (multi-PCR) was used to detect the possible pathogen in these samples. All human adenovirus (HAdV)-positive samples were inoculated onto Hep-2 cells for isolation. HAdV isolates were typed by hexon gene, fiber gene, and whole genome sequencing using primers designed inhouse and compared to different type/serotype HAdVs downloaded from GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis was used to determine the type of the HAdV. Results: Of the 38 samples, 34 from 17 cases were HAdV-positive; two of them were co-infected, one with respiratory syncytial virus A and the other with human rhinovirus. The hexon gene open reading frame (ORF; 2841 nucleotides (nt)) and fiber gene ORF (978 nt) were obtained from four HAdV strains (TJ-2013-92, TJ-2013-94, TJ-2013-100, TJ-2013-122) from three upper respiratory infection cases and one pneumonia case. They were all completely identical. One HAdV isolate, TJ-2013-90, was selected for whole genome sequencing; 34 238 nt were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis showed the whole genome of TJ-2013-90 to be clustered together with HAdV-B55/HAdV-B11a. Three of 60 influenza virus-negative specimens were HAdV-positive, but hexon and fiber gene analysis showed that they were grouped in different branches to the HAdV isolates from this outbreak. Conclusions: The cause of this ARTI outbreak was HAdV-B55. This was another outbreak caused by this re-emerging virus. Continuous surveillance of respiratory adenovirus is necessary for disease control. \u00df 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

            "text": "Numerous outbreaks of ARTIs caused by HAdV have been reported during recent decades in many countries, including China. 10, 12, 14 HAdV is a double-stranded DNA virus that has a common nonenveloped icosahedral capsid morphology and a similar genome structure. Many different criteria are used to classify HAdVs. According to genomic criteria, HAdVs are grouped primarily into seven species (A-G). The species classification is closely associated with differences in the affected human organs (tropism). Within each species, serotypes are distinguished based on their reactivity in the virus neutralization assay. This reactivity is mainly due to antibodies to the major capsid protein, the hexon, but also to antibodies to the penton base and fiber protein. Presently, 51 HAdV serotypes have been recognized. Within many serotypes, variants have been defined by restriction enzyme analysis of genomic DNA. 15 Currently, the serological type definition is being replaced by genomic criteria. 2 On this basis, 16 more HAdV types have been registered as HAdV-52 to HAdV-67. Among these, HAdV-B55 is a re-emerging pathogen; it was first identified as HAdV-B11a in an outbreak during a military training exercise in 1974, 9 with a second appearance in another military training exercise in 2004. 6 Next came the Singapore military recruit outbreak in 2005, 7 and an outbreak in a civilian population in Shanxi Province in China in 2006. 8 Most of the infections caused by HAdV-B55 in adults are upper respiratory illnesses occurring as outbreaks. These usually arise in military training facilities and crowded population groups. One of the risk factors for this severe illness may be the crowding and increased physical and psychological stress. In the present study, we report another HAdV-B55 outbreak in a physical training facility in Tianjin, China. In this outbreak, five of 19 cases had severe pneumonia and had to be hospitalized. All five cases were young males with no underlying diseases. A recent report has shown that HAdV may lead to community-acquired pneumonia in children less than 10 years of age. 16 Surveillance for HAdV in both children and adults should be enhanced.",

The hexon and fiber genes of the viruses isolated in this outbreak in Tianjin clustered with HAdV-B11 and HAdV-B14, respectively, and also showed highest identity with QS-DLL. The identities of the fiber and hexon genes from HAdV isolated in this outbreak were 100%, and the absence of any other relevant pathogen suggests that this virus was responsible for the outbreak. To allow for the determination of the exact viral type, we sequenced the whole genome of one of the viruses isolated here. The whole genome analysis showed that the virus isolated in this outbreak shared almost 100% homology (only four nucleotides were different) to QS-DLL, and it was also grouped together with QS-DLL in the phylogenetic tree; this suggests HAdV-B55 to be the reason for the outbreak.",

They strongly suggested that the Chinese virus strain QS-DLL should be serotyped as HAdV-B11-14. They also proposed that the molecular typing and designation of recombinant viruses be based on the sequences of the hexon and fiber genes, as they confirmed that these genes accommodated the major epitopes involved in virus neutralization (VN). One month later, Seto wrote a letter to the editor of the same journal to dispute the opinions of Kajor. Seto claimed that using serology-based typing and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were no longer performed in HAdV research, both of these assays being interpretive, subjective, and error-prone. 13 At the Tenth International Adenovirus Meeting (Umea, Sweden, 2012), it was agreed that 'genotype' was to refer to HAdV characterized and type-numbered with genome data, 'molecular type' was to refer to viruses with limited DNA sequence data, and 'serotype' was to be reserved for strains characterized completely with serological methods. The designation of the QS-DLL strain as HAdV-55 was correct. 13 Recombination is one of the mechanisms of evolution by which viruses escape from human immunity. Partial genome analysis is not sufficient to investigate virus recombination. Whole genome sequence analysis is necessary for recombination research. China has a large, dense population, which makes the spread of infectious diseases easier. The need to establish and improve both epidemiological and virological surveillance for HAdV infections in China is emphasized. Continuous surveillance and molecular characterization of respiratory adenovirus isolates worldwide will contribute to the elucidation of the natural history and pathogenesis of HAdV respiratory infections.",
