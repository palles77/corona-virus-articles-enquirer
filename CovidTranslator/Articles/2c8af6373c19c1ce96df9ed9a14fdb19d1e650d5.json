Both infants and older adults exhibit blunted immune responses to infections and vaccination. However, the underlying mechanisms for immune dysfunction are distinct. Infants are born with limited antigen exposure and an immature immune system, which, however, progressively develops throughout infancy and childhood. The mechanisms underlying the immune dysfunction in older adults are broadly termed immunosenescence. The term is reminiscent of cellular senescence, which is defined as the loss of the ability to proliferate as a result of an irreversible cell cycle block. However, it is misleading to interpret immune aging only as the accumulation of senescent cells, and similar to aging in general, numerous pathways are involved. 1 The decline in immune competence is not linear. As early as age 40 years, vaccine responses to selected vaccines (e.g., hepatitis B) start to decline. The incidence rate of herpes zoster, a reactivation of latent varicellazoster virus (VZV), starts to increase at age 50 years, as does morbidity and mortality from influenza infection. A more abrupt transition appears to occur in the eighth decade of life.",

Although child mortality rates have dropped by almost 50% between 1990 and 2013, pathogenic infections are still one of the largest causes of infant mortality worldwide, accounting for more than 1.6 million deaths a year. Vaccinations have helped change the infectious landscape in children and young adults, but certain vaccines, such as those against Streptococcus pneumoniae, still have limited protective capacity at both extremes of age. Susceptibility to pathogenic infection and ineffectiveness of vaccination is even greater in older adults than in young infants. Moreover, during aging, a functional immune system is important for tissue repair and is of increasing importance in degenerative diseases, and it is vital for cancer surveillance. Immunosenescence is of increasing importance because of the changing population demographics, with increases in the number of individuals older than 65 years in both developed and developing countries.",

Immunosuppressive regulatory pathways utilized by the fetus for protection against possible infections and maternal-fetal rejection in utero are still reflected in the newborn infant immune system, characterized by immune-suppressive, antiinflammatory, and immature cellular responses to foreign antigens. Although newborns and young infants lack the ability to mount effective immune responses against many pathogens, they acquire initial immune protection through the passive transfer of maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) in utero via the placenta (termed \"passive immunity\") 2 and from secretory IgA and antimicrobial factors present in maternal breast milk. Alternations in passive immunity (e.g., preterm birth) can lead to increased susceptibility to infections and breakdown of immune tolerance in the infant. Passive immunity can be enhanced by vaccination of pregnant mothers to promote the transfer of vaccine-specific IgG in utero. However, within the first months of life, as maternal IgG wanes and breastfeeding is discontinued, infants must actively develop their own innate and adaptive immune responses to initiate and maintain immune protection. An overview of the development of innate and adaptive cells, as well as the repertoire of diversity during aging, is outlined in Fig. 38 .1.",

The most significant functional limitation of neonatal innate immune cells is their collective inability to kill pathogens. Limited chemotaxis in neutrophils is accompanied by a reduced ability to effectively kill pathogens as a result of poor phagocytosis and decreased secretion of neutrophil extracellular traps under inflammatory conditions, which in combination results in decreased killing of infectious pathogens. Moreover, NK cells and plasmacytoid DCs have reduced capacity to prevent that although lymphocytes initially develop within the fetal liver (\u22487 WG) and then in bone marrow (\u224812 WG), T-cell maturation occurs in the thymus, and B cells continue maturation in bone marrow in utero and after birth. Over the course of gestation, both na\u00efve T-cell and B-cell compartments expand, reaching absolute cell concentrations greater than that of the adults by birth. Thus a defect in cellular generation cannot account for the immune limitations observed in infants. However, the composition of the each lymphocyte population within young infants is distinct from that of adults. At birth, both the newborn infant T-and B-cell compartments consist mainly of na\u00efve and immature cells recently migrated out of the thymus or bone marrow (>90% of the population). Both infant T-and B-cell repertoires have less diversity within their receptors' antigenbinding regions compared with those of adults. T-cell receptors display reduced V-J complexity and fewer amino acid additions. In addition, B cells have decreased B-cell receptor diversity because of less affinity maturation (i.e., somatic hypermutation; Chapter 7) compared with adult populations.",

In addition to these numerical differences, the functional potential of HSCs changes with age. 7 Old HSCs exhibit a reduced capacity to regenerate the hematopoietic system. Telomerase expression in peripheral HSCs is not fully protective, and a shortening in telomeric length is seen with age, similar to differentiated mononuclear cells.

A causative relationship may also exist between the increased production of IL-6 or TNF-\u03b1 and the age-associated loss in muscle mass, eventually presenting as sarcopenia. Long-lived individuals, such as centenarians, tend to have lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased levels of antiinflammatory mediators, such as cortisone and IL-10, supporting the concept that low-level inflammation is detrimental to healthy aging.",

Moreover, the frequency of typical memory B cells expressing CD27 declines, whereas other B-cell subpopulations increase. In particular, a functionally distinct B-cell population that responds to Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation has been described. 9 These age-associated differences in B-cell selection and expansion may contribute to monoclonal gammopathies (in >5% of individuals older than 70 years; Chapter 80) or increased autoantibodies with increasing age. High-throughput sequencing of Ig genes has the promise to provide insights into the age-associated decline in B-cell responses at the single-cell level.

The thymus undergoes dramatic structural changes that begin during childhood and puberty. 10 Thymopoietic niches disappear, and the numbers of thymic epithelial cells and thymocytes decline. In parallel, the thymic perivascular space increases. One major structural change that does not appear to be a compensatory response but, rather, is an active and regulated developmental step in thymic organ transformation is the accumulation and infiltration of adipocytes in the perivascular space. Thymic resection in children undergoing cardiac surgery reproduces many of the T-cell repertoire changes in 20-year-old individuals that are usually seen in 70-to 80-year-olds, confirming that thymic production during the growth period of childhood and adolescence is important. However, throughout adulthood, homeostatic proliferation of na\u00efve T cells accounts for the bulk of T-cell generation. 11 For human CD4 T cells, this process is robust, and frequencies of na\u00efve CD4 T cells only moderately decline with age. In contrast, the na\u00efve CD8 T-cell compartment clearly shrinks. However, repertoire diversity (i.e., the number of different T-cell receptors [TCRs]) remains very high for both na\u00efve CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets, suggesting that thymic activity is not necessary to prevent holes in the repertoire once a repertoire has formed. Strategies to reactivate thymic T-cell generation will be more important in older patients who cannot restore the na\u00efve T-cell repertoire after a medical intervention, such as chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation, compared with their healthy counterparts.",
