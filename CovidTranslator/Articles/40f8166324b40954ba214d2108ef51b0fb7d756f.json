The aim of this study was to establish an early prediction model of fatal adverse prognosis of fever patients by extracting key indicators using big data technology. Methods: A retrospective study of patients' data was conducted using the Emergency Rescue Database of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital. Patients were divided into the fatal adverse prognosis group and the good prognosis group. The commonly used clinical indicators were compared. Recursive feature elimination method was used to determine the optimal number of the included variables. In the training model, logistic regression, random forest, adaboost, and bagging were selected. We also collected the emergency room data from December 2018 to December 2019 with the same inclusion and exclusion criterion. The performance of the model was evaluated by accuracy, F1-score, precision, sensitivity, and the areas under receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC-AUC). Results: The accuracy of logistic regression, decision tree, adaboost and bagging was 0.951, 0.928, 0.924, and 0.924, F1-scores were 0.938, 0.933, 0.930, and 0.930, the precision was 0.943, 0.938, 0.937, and 0.937, ROC-AUC were 0.808, 0.738, 0.736, and 0.885, respectively. ROC-AUC of ten-fold cross-validation in logistic and bagging models were 0.80 and 0.87, respectively. The top six coefficients and odds ratio (OR) values of the variables in the logistic regression were cardiac troponin T (CTnT) (coefficient = 0.346, OR = 1.413), temperature (T) (coefficient = 0.235, OR = 1.265), respiratory rate (RR) (coefficient= -0.206, OR = 0.814), serum kalium (K) (coefficient = 0.137, OR = 1.146), pulse oxygen saturation (SPO 2 ) (coefficient = -0.101, OR = 0.904), and albumin (ALB) (coefficient = -0.043, OR = 0.958). The weights of the top six variables in the bagging model were: CTnT, RR, lactate dehydrogenase, serum amylase, heart rate, and systolic blood pressure. Conclusions: The main clinical indicators of concern included CTnT, RR, SPO 2 , T, ALB, and K. The bagging model and logistic regression model had better diagnostic performance comprehesively. Those may be conducive to the early identification of critical patients with fever by physicians.",

Then, the optimal number was used in RFE as the parameter to determine the entry predictor of the final model. In this research, the decision tree was used to select the predictors into the final model. Also, the Pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyze the variable correlation of the factors in model and the results were shown using a heat map. To explore the most important factors, we reduced the optimal number to a smaller one and repeated the above process. The co-existing factors were chosen for further discussion.",

When its level increases, it can reflect the increased severity of myocardial injury, with high specificity. [13] [14] [15] Previous studies have suggested that myocardial injury, as reflected by elevated cardiac troponin levels in plasma, is common in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. [16] The main reason for poor prognosis in patients with severe sepsis is that patients often have cardiac dysfunction. Once the cardiovascular system is damaged, the death rate of patients increases greatly. [17] In this study, ALB was found to be a key factor in predicting the death or poor prognosis in patients with fever. Hoeboer et al [18] concluded that ALB rather than Creactive protein may be valuable in predicting and monitoring the severity and course of acute respiratory distress syndrome in critically ill patients with or at risk for the syndrome after new onset fever. Therefore, active correction of hypoproteinemia in patients with fever may improve prognosis.",

When HR, RR, and SBP increased in patients with fever, SPO 2 should be detected in time, and should be improved by early non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation treatment, so as to reasonably shorten the mechanical ventilation time to reduce the mortality of patients. Single-factor analysis showed that serum sodium of adverse prognosis group was higher than that of good prognosis group, suggesting that for clinical patients with severe fever, timely fluid supplement should be given to correct hyper serum sodium caused by dehydration and other reasons.",
