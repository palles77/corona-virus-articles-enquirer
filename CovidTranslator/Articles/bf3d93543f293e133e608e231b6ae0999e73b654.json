Sequence comparison with other transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) strains selected from the Gene Bank revealed that the homology of N gene complete sequence shares more than 97% in nucleotide. N gene was cloned into BamHI and EcoRI multiple cloning sites of the prokaryotic expression vector pET 20 b, and named pETN. After being induced by isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), the recombinant nucleocapsid protein was expressed. The result of SDS-PAGE and Western-blot showed that the recombinant nucleocapsid protein was 47 kDa and had strong positive reactions with TGEV-specific antibody.",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus is a coronavirus that causes enteric disease in swine of all ages. The disease is especially severe in newborn animals less than two weeks old, in which mortality approaches 100% (Siddell et al., 1983; Sturman and Holmes, 1983; Saif and Bohl, 1986) . Statistics suggest that 39.8% of dead pigs in China died of diarrhea and 10.3% were caused by TGEV. Transmissible gastroenteritis has become one of the severe viral diarrhea diseases in young pigs that leads to severe economic loss in pig farming. Therefore, it is important to prevent and control the disease. However, because of the similarity between TGE and porcine epidemic diarrhea in clinical signs and pathology, there is no effective method in the country to distinguish one from the other accurately.",

Numerous studies have shown that the N gene of the TGEV is highly conserved (Jacobs et al., 1986) and high level of N protein-specific antibody is produced at the early stage of TGEV infection (Ksestak et al., 1999) .

To analyze the phylogenetic relationships of HB06 with other TGEV strains isolated in various parts of the world, we constructed a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree using the N gene sequences. A representative minimal tree for the N gene is shown in Fig. 3 . ",

High levels of N protein-specific antibodies will be produced in pigs in the initial stage of TGEV infection (Ksestak et al., 1999) and the level of antibody can reflect the level of neutralizing antibodies (Ksestak et al., 1999) . The N protein, used as a candidate antigen for the diagnosis of TGEV infection, has advantages of high sequence conservation and large expression in TGEV infected cells (Jacobs et al., 1986) .",

Fig. 4 Identification of recombinant plasmid PETN with restriction digestion 3.3 Expression and biological activity of N gene Isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at concen tration of 1mmol induced the expression of N gene in the pET20-N-BL21 system. After electrophoretic analysis and Coomassie blue-staining, a visible extra band of 47 kDa was detected in the extracts of BL21 cells transformed with the recombinant plasmid pETN (Fig. 5). The size observed corresponds to the expected size for the fusion protein. The Note: Lane 1, molecular mass markers; Lane 2, crude extract from pETN transformed cells; Lane 3, Control; lane 4, Immunoblotting analysis of the expression protein with TGEV specific antiserum. Fig. 5 SDS-PAGE and Western-blot analysis of the expression proteinidentity of this protein was confirmed by immunoblotting. Specific antisera against TGEV gave a clear positive reaction with the 47 kDa protein(Fig. 5).",
