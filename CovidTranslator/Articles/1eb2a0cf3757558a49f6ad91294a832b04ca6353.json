On 30 Jan 2020, WHO declared SARS-CoV-2 epidemic a public health emergency of international concern. 3 As a newly discovered virus, SARS-CoV-2 has brought about much more serious global health threats than the two former major pandemics by other members of coronavirus family, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 5 As of Mar 6, 2020, a total of 98192 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed globally, including 80711cases in China and 17481 cases in other 88 countries/territories/areas. Of them, 3380 patients died, 3045 in China and 335 in abroad. 6 Data from the early epidemic revealed that common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection included fever, fatigue, dry cough, and shortness of breath, and older males with comorbidities are more susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 infection and progressive to severe and even fatal respiratory diseases. 7, 8 Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact. 8, 9 The management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is mainly symptomatic treatment and life support for severely and critically ill patients. Anti-viral treatment has been listed in protocols issued by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), however, these antiviral agents have yet to be confirmed effective for SARS-CoV-2. 9 Currently, SARS-CoV-2 has infected most patients and caused most deaths in Wuhan, China. However, little information focusing on final outcome and disease severity on admission can be obtained associated with clinical characteristics during the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. In this retrospective study, we aimed to describe and compare the clinical features of patients with COVID-19 related to final outcome and disease severity on admission during its ongoing outbreak in Wuhan, China.",

Indexes of laboratory test on admission were evaluated, including complete blood count, C reactive protein (CRP), blood biochemistry, myocardial enzymes, and coagulating function. Findings of chest computed tomographic scan (CT) or x-ray film on admission were reviewed and listed. Disease severity (ordinary, severe, or critical) was determined according to the guidance issued by NHC 9 . Treatment measures evaluated in this research contained high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC), non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), blood purification treatment, application of antiviral agents, antibacterial agents, anti-fungal agents, corticosteroids, and immunoglobulin. The primary endpoint of this study was patients' clinical outcome (died or recovered), and secondary endpoint was disease severity on admission. Criteria for recovery were as follows: temperature returned to normal for more than 3 days, respiratory symptoms improved significantly, and negative results of two consecutive SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in respiratory samples (sampling interval at least 1 day). 9",

Remdesivir and chloroquine are considered two promising agents for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 15 which were given to some patients in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. However, it's hardly to assess the efficacy and safety of remdesivir and chloroquine until results of the trials are released. Short-term (3 to 5 days) application of glucocorticoids is suggested for severe patients with COVID-19 in the protocol issued by NHC. 9 In this study, glucocorticoids were applied in 166 (41.2%) cases, most of whom were patients with severe or critical illness. However, glucocorticoids use was found to be correlated with increased mortality in SARS patients and delayed virus clearance. 16, 17 In this context, glucocorticoids are not routinely recommended in treatment of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. 18 In this study, secondary infection appeared mostly in patients with glucocorticoids use and might contribute to death, which was indicated by its higher incidence in patients who died (58.0% vs. 6.3%, p<0.001).

Second, the agents given to patients such as antibiotics, antivirus agents and anti-fungals, might exert toxicity to organs, which confounded judgment of organ damage by virus or excessive inflammatory stress.

Abnormal serum sodium was observed in 21.8% (88) cases. Non-survivors showed lower serum sodium (median 141.1 (136.6-144.2) mmol/L vs. 143.2 (139.6-144.3) mmol/L, p=0.001) and higher incidence of abnormal serum sodium (48% vs. 13.2%, p<0.001) compared to survivors on admission . Two hundred and five (50.9%) cases were diagnosed as severe or critical illness, and 198 were ordinary illness on admission, according to the criteria issued by NHC 9 . Patients with severe or critical illness presented older age (median 66 (56-74) years vs. 43 (33-56) years, p <0.001), higher proportions of male gender (56.6% vs. 38.9%, p <0.001) or chronic diseases (58.0% vs. 28.3%, p <0.001), and more delayed hospitalization (median 10 (7-13) days vs. 8 (5-11) days, p <0.001) than those with ordinary illness.

The incidence of increased serum total bilirubin (16.6% vs. 4.0%, p <0.001) and creatinine (16.7% vs. 4.3%, p =0.002) in patients with severe or critical disease were obviously higher than patients with ordinary disease. Patients with severe or critical illness showed markedly elevated serum level of hypersensitive troponin I (median 0.012 (0.006-0.062) ng/mL vs. 0.006 (0.006-0.006) ng/mL, p <0.001), D-dimer (median 1.22 (0.52-7.46) mg/L vs. 0.39 (0.23-0.83) mg/L, p <0.001), C-reactive protein (median 59.7 (20.7-103.5) mg/L vs. 6.8 (5.0-25.7) mg/L, p <0.001), and procalcitonin (median 0.10 (0.05-0.26) ng/mL vs. 0.04 (0.02-0.06) ng/mL, p <0.001) compared to those with ordinary illness.Decreased serum sodium appeared in patients with severe or critical illness compared to those with ordinary illness (median 141.2 (137.9-143.9) mmol/L vs. 143.5 (142.2-145.0) mmol/L, p<0.001).
