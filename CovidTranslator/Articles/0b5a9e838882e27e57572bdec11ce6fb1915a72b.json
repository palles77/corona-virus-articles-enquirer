There are two epidemiological parameters of an outbreak that can be used to characterize the disease: the basic reproductive number, R 0 , and the serial (or generation) interval; the latter defined as the time between a primary case and a secondary case developing symptoms (Fraser et al., 2004; Bauch et al., 2005) .",

We do not attempt to give a comprehensive overview of this, but rather refer the interested reader to Anderson and Britton (2000) and Becker and Britton (1999) and references therein. Perhaps the most simple of these methods is the Reed Frost model which is appropriate for analyzing data from small epidemics, particularly from small group data, such as a household. This model rapidly becomes complicated as the size of the epidemic increases, restricting its utility to small outbreaks. More general modeling approaches exist that allow for larger populations, and inhomogeneous populations. These more general models can be generally used to estimate the final size of an epidemic and R 0 . Becker (1989) , Rida (1991) and Shao (1999) describe some approaches to these models. Becker (1976) and Ball and Donnelly (1995) describe how the initial period of a stochastic SIR model can be estimated by a branching process. Branching processes have been widely studied and their theory is well developed (see Guttorp, 1991 and references therein) . Estimation of R 0 is relatively simple with a branching process and one can also obtain estimates of the final size of the epidemic, as well as the probability of observing a major epidemic (defined as an epidemic that does not die out on its own). To implement this method one needs to know the mean of the serial interval, or have an epidemic with a long incubation time, which leads to clearly clustered data that can then be grouped into",

Their method assumes that there is no immigration into the system and thus that all cases can be traced back to the index case(s). provide a modification of this method that allows real-time estimation of R 0 using Bayesian techniques to augment the data. Additionally, have recently described a Bayesian method that uses a small subset of contact tracing data and daily case counts to determine the efficacy of the interventions by observing posterior probabilities of R 0 < 1.

Without loss of generality, we assume that t is indexing days, however this method is applicable to any discrete time unit. We consider that a typical infectious disease outbreak can be characterized by a two step process: we first have the basic reproductive number, R 0 , the average number of secondary cases produced by a single infected in a population of susceptible individuals. We then consider the serial interval, the distribution of the time between a primary case developing symptoms and a case, that she or he infects, becoming ill. This interval is a function of the incubation distribution and distribution of infectiousness which are not readily observed. Note that the distribution of the serial interval can be linked to the incubation distribution (see Kuk and Ma, 2005) , which is also sometimes used to characterize an outbreak. As a possible model, suppose that the number of secondary cases produced by an infected individual follows a Poisson distribution, with expected value R 0 , and that the serial interval is described by a multinomial distribution. We assume that primary cases always appear with symptoms before their secondary cases, that there is no movement in and out of the system of infected cases, and that an outbreak behaves in the following manner: Let N 0 individuals be the cases that initially show at the outset of the epidemic. Each of these cases independently generates secondary cases according to a Poisson distribution with mean R 0 . Let X 0 represent the total number of cases produced by the initial N 0 cases, then X 0 \u223c P ois(N 0 R 0 ). We then allow these X 0 cases to present over the subsequent k days according to a multinomial distribution. In general we use the notation where N i represents the total number of cases on day i, X ij represents the number of cases that present on day j, which were generated by the N i cases, and X i denotes the total number of cases produced by primary cases on day i (i.e. X i = j X ij ).

It should be clearly stated that the data used in this analysis does not completely match the assumptions of Wallinga and Tuenis, since it does not represent a completed outbreak. However we feel it is worthwhile to see how they perform as a real time estimator. In Table   1 the impact of not meeting this assumption is minimal for R 0 small, but becomes more dramatic as R 0 increases to 2.00. All methods perform well when the serial interval is correctly specified. We note that when the serial interval is incorrectly assumed (the non-bolded entries) the estimates become biased. Specifically for the MLE and branching process estimator when the serial interval is assumed too long we observe that we overestimate R 0 , as intuition would prescribe. When the serial interval is assumed too small we tend to be negatively biased. The bias pattern for the WT estimator is not clear. The branching process estimator closely follows the MLE estimator due to the similarity in their form. In fact, we see here that knowing the full distribution of the serial interval offers little advantage over only knowing the mean of the serial interval, when the data is simulated as above, indicating that R 0 can be well estimated without knowledge of the second moment of the serial interval. If the serial interval is misspecified, this method is more sensitive, as it cannot draw on other information about the serial interval that might offset the misspecification of the mean. Additionally, when the true mean of the serial interval is not an integer, it is more difficult to implement the branching process method and one must either round the mean of the serial interval or somehow redistribute the data.",

Thus we consider the first 58 days of data for the Ebola outbreak, the first 25 days of the H7N7 Avian Influenza outbreak and the first 20 days of the Swine Flu outbreak. Table 3 provides results when we use all of the data during the \"growth\" phase of the epidemic. The estimate of R 0 for Ebola is strikingly similar to those given by Chowell et al. (2004) . Additionally we note the relatively long serial interval that is consistent with the previously described incubation distribution. The estimates for both Influenza outbreaks also appear to be consistent with previous results for Influenza having relatively short serial intervals (\u03bc = 2.95 and 1.40 days) and values for R 0 that exceed one (R 0 = 1.17 and 1.13). We note, however, that the estimated interquartile ranges are very high for Ebola and Avian Influenza. This is likely explained by a number of factors. These outbreaks started with a much smaller number of cases (one and five) compared to the swine flu epidemic which started with nine. We have discussed that the asymptotic properties are dependent on having a large number of initial cases. This also might be a reflection of the bootstrapping technique which we utilize. We simulated 1000 datasets using the estimated parameters and then consider the variability in these estimates.",

However, in general these properties are likely not attainable. This is not of great concern because in practice we are unlikely to attain asymptotic conditions, making such statements of little practical use except as guides. Therefore we turn to Bayesian methods and simulations to explain and understand the small sample properties of the estimators.

Additionally, incorporating limited contact tracing data, as did with their method, might lead to an increased ability to estimate the serial interval. This might be done via MCMC methods and the use of a prior distribution estimated from the contact traced data.We have assumed that secondary cases are generated according to a Poisson distribution (the so-called offspring distribution). While this may not be perfectly accurate for disease generation, since individuals or groups of people may have different characteristics that would lead them to generate cases at varying rates, we feel that this is a reasonable starting point. Further, this assumption can be relaxed through proper modeling of R 0 to account for factors that might lead to differential infection rates, including seasonality, day of the week, demographic variables, and a shrinking susceptible population. Additionally we have assumed homogenous mixing with this formulation, but again feel that there is adequate flexibility in the model to relax this assumption.Results from the simulation study and their interquartile ranges are based on1000 monte carlo simulations. Estimates are obtained using the MLE method, WT estimator and branching process estimator (BP). Estimates are the median of the 1000 simulations and the interquartile range (IQR) of the simulations is given in parenthesis. Case 2 and Case 3 have serial intervals that are gamma distributed with means 3.0 and 8.0, respectively and variances 9.18 and 16.0 respectively. Bolded entries indicate analysis done with the correct serial interval assumed. Estimates from the simulation study with their interquartile ranges are based on 1000 monte carlo simulations.
