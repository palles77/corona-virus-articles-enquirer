Three Japanese Black (JB) fattening cattle (2 males and 1 female) on different cattle farms presented with chronic episodic diarrhea without fever or dehydration. Soft reddish spherical carneous tissues (1\u22123 cm) were occasionally excreted within the diarrheic feces. Administration of antibiotics, antidiarrheal drugs and vermicides had no therapeutic effect, but dexamethasone improved the fecal characteristics. The symptoms persisted until the animals were slaughtered at 27-30 months of age. Histopathological examination of the intestines revealed marked eosinophilic infiltration in the lamina propria and submucosa. From these findings, we diagnosed these cattle as the first cases of EOE in Jb cattle. KEY WORDS: eosinophilic enteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Japanese Black cattle",

IBD is a common disease characterized by persistent or recurrent gastrointestinal signs, such as diarrhea and weight loss, in certain animal species and humans [6, 7] . Eosinophilic enteritis (EOE) is part of the IBD complex and is a morphological diagnosis characterized by inflammation in which eosinophilic leucocytes predominate [1] , with clinical signs typified by chronic obstinate diarrhea. It is a minor cause of IBD in humans [6, 11] , dogs [10] , cats [4, 5] and horses [1, 8, 9] ; however, few cases of EOE in cattle have been reported [2] . This research group previously reported 4 cases of idiopathic EOE in cattle, aged 1 (Angus heifer), 5 (Simmental bull), 7 (Holstein cow) and 11 (Holstein cow) years old, diagnosed on the basis of clinical and histopathological findings and exclusion of other differential diagnoses for cattle with chronic diarrhea and weight loss. However, to the best of our knowledge, neither the occurrence of EOE in Japanese black (Jb) cattle nor the associated clinical symptoms from the first appearance of their symptoms after purchase or birth to completion of their fattening periods (approximately 30 months of age) have been reported thus far.",

The detailed information/ histories and clinical signs of these 3 animals are summarized in Table 1 . All 3 animals displayed similar characteristic clinical symptoms: chronic episodic diarrhea without fever or dehydration starting at an early stage after purchase (Cases 1 and 2) or birth (Case 3), with occasional excretion within the diarrheic feces of a small number of soft reddish spherical carneous tissues (1\u22123 cm in diameter) of unknown origin (Fig. 1) . In all cases, although therapeutic interventions consisting mainly of antibiotics, antidiarrheal drugs and vermicides administered when the diarrhea was observed had no therapeutic effect, the administration of dexamethasone (3\u22125 mg/head mixed with ampicillin and administered by intramuscular injection daily for 3 days) temporarily improved the fecal characteristics for a period of several days. The chronic diarrhea and excretion of the \"spherical tissue\" persisted until the cattle were slaughtered at 27-30 months of age; however, all 3 animals had normal appetites, growth rates and body weights when compared to other cattle without diarrhea that were housed on the same farm. For exclusion of differential disease diagnoses, antemortem fecal examinations of these 3 animals were performed to determine the presence of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, culture on DHL agar and detection of 99K antigen with TETRASTRIPS [bio-X Diagnostics, Sprl]; Salmonella spp., culture on DHL agar; Clostridium perfringens, culture on DHL agar; and C. difficile [C. Diff Quick Check Complete; Techlab \u00ae ]), viruses (coronavirus [Tetrastrips; bio-X Diagnostics, Sprl]) and rotavirus [Tetrastrips]), protozoa (Eimeria spp. and Cryptosporidium spp.) and parasites. A complete blood count and serum biochemical profile were performed in 2 of the animals (Cases 2 and 3). Additionally, PCR and ELISA (Johne's screening ELISA kit; Institute of Microbial Chemistry) assays were performed to exclude bovine viral diarrhea (bVD) and Johne's disease, respectively. Overall, pathogenic microorganisms that may cause longterm chronic diarrhea were not detected in the feces of the 3 animals. Additionally, the test results for bVD and Johne's disease were negative.",

The fixed intestinal and spherical tissues were embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned at 4-\u00b5m thickness, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined histopathologically. Macroscopic observation of the intestinal tract revealed areas of severe hemorrhage, particularly in the colonic mucosa, in all 3 cases (Fig. 2) . However, macroscopic observation revealed no pathological abnormalities in other organs in any of the 3 cases. Histological examination revealed marked eosinophilic, lymphocytic and plasmacytic inflammatory-cell infiltration in the lamina propria of the jejunum, cecum, colon and rectum, which partially extended to the submucosa (Fig. 3) . Microscopic examination of the spherical tissues in the diarrheic feces revealed that they consisted mainly of a fibrin clot, including mucosal epithelial cells, red blood cells and eosinophils, which were speculated to have derived from the persistently inflamed tissues in the intestinal tract of the affected cattle (Fig. 4) .",

Eosinophilia, hypoalbuminemia and hyperglobulinemia have been suggested as useful parameters in the diagnosis of EOE based on hematological and biochemical examination results [3, 7, 9] . Additionally, it has been suggested that there is a strong relationship between the clinical and biochemical findings and the degree of eosinophilic infiltration of intestinal layers in EOE-affected animals [7] . In the present study, the results of hematological and serum biochemical examinations in our 3 cattle cases were within normal ranges, which was in agreement with a previous report in cattle by Cebra et al. [2] . Although the reasons for the discrepancies between the results of hematological and serum biochemical examinations and the chronic symptoms exhibited by the affected cattle are obscure, this finding suggests the possible pathophysiology in EOE-affected cattle. Additionally, histopathological examination of the intestinal tissues from the 3 animals indicated marked infiltration of eosinophils, lymphocytes and plasma cells in the lamina propria of the mucosa, with occasional extension of the infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells into the submucosa or muscular layer of the jejunum, ileum and large intestine, which might be in line with the previous report by Cebra et al. [2] . However, the clinical symptoms of our patients differed from those in the report by Cebra et al. [2] regarding 2 parameters: (1) maintenance of good growth rates and (2) excretion of carneous tissue. Cebra et al. [2] suggested that there is a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms in EOE in cattle; this might explain these differences. Cebra et al. [2] diagnosed EOE in 2 out of 4 affected cattle during the antemortem period by examining excisional biopsy samples obtained during exploratory laparotomy via a right-flank incision, and administration of corticosteroids was initiated on the basis of an objective diagnosis. Allowing for evidence-based medicine and animal-welfare issues in cattle with chronic illness, endoscopic observation and biopsy of the large intestine after a preliminary diagnosis of EOE has been made may enable timely confirmation and appropriate treatment of EOE in Jb cattle.",
