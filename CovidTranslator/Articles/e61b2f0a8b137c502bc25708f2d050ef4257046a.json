Ordered-domain formation in the outer leaflet was compared to that in symmetric vesicles with the same lipid composition as the asymmetric vesicle outer leaflets. The difference between ordered-domain thermal stability in asymmetric and symmetric vesicles was highly dependent on high-Tm PC acyl-chain length. At one extreme, in diC 14:0 PC-containing asymmetric vesicles, the outer leaflet did not segregate to form ordered domains over the entire experimental temperature range even though ordered domains formed in the symmetric vesicles, indicating the inner leaflet dominated outer-leaflet physical behavior in the asymmetric vesicles. At the other extreme, in diC 18:0 PC-containing asymmetric vesicles, ordered domains formed over the entire temperature range at which they were present in symmetric vesicles, indicating the inner leaflet did not dominate outer-leaflet physical behavior. DiC 15:0 PCand diC 16:0 PC-containing vesicles exhibited intermediate behaviors. A different set of vesicles was prepared with high-Tm lipid sphingomyelin (SM) in place of saturated phosphatidylcholine, and the % SM was varied. The thermal stability of outer-leaflet ordered domains in asymmetric vesicles was found to decrease more than in symmetric vesicles as SM levels decreased, indicating that the inner leaflet increasingly dominated outer leaflet physical state as SM levels decreased. Overall, inhibition of outer-leaflet ordered-domain formation in asymmetric vesicles by inner-leaflet lipids decreased as the ability of outer-leaflet lipids to form an ordered state by themselves increased, i.e., when outer-leaflet high-Tm lipid content or acyl-chain length increased. This has implications for how ordered-domain formation may be controlled in vivo.",

In artificial lipid membranes, lipid domains have been studied extensively (4) . Coexisting ordered-and disordered-domain formation is detected in vesicles when high-Tm (melting temperature) lipids (meaning a high gel-to-liquid melting temperature in vesicles composed of a single lipid), low-Tm lipids, and cholesterol are mixed (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . However, many biological membranes are asymmetric, with different lipid compositions in the inner and outer leaflet of the bilayer (12) . This is important, because although the outer (exofacial) leaflets contain the required lipid mixtures for ordered-domain formation (13) , inner (cytosolic) leaflets dominated by low-Tm glycerophospholipids and cholesterol are unlikely to be able to form ordered lipid domains spontaneously (14) .",

Their inner leaflets were composed of lipids that do not spontaneously form ordered domains. AUVs were prepared through (2-hydroxypropyl)-a-cyclodextrin (HPaCD)-induced lipid exchange (27) . Conditions were identified that give efficient cyclodextrin-catalyzed transfer not only for sphingomyelin (SM) but also for saturated phosphatidylcholine (PC). To target FRET measurements to the outer leaflet, Rho-DOPE delivered to the outer leaflet of the vesicles was employed as the FRET acceptor. The FRET donor was DPH added to the preformed AUVs. Measuring FRET versus temperature revealed the thermal stability of ordered domains in the outer leaflet. Comparison of ordered-domain stability in AUVs to ordered-domain stability in symmetric vesicles with the same composition as the AUVs' outer leaflet revealed that interleaflet coupling can influence ordered domain formation. Ordered-domain formation driven by outer-leaflet high-Tm phosphatidylcholines (28) or SM showed that high-Tm lipid acyl-chain length and mole fraction determine the extent to which the inner leaflet could inhibit outer-leaflet ordereddomain formation. This has implications for how cells could control ordered-domain/raft formation.",

One is the variability in FRET acceptor introduced into the asymmetric vesicles. The more FRET acceptor the asymmetric vesicles have, the higher the level of FRET when FRET is being measured by donor quenching, as in the experiments in this study. The value of FRET (as given by F/Fo) was normalized at high temperature to 1 to minimize how this alters the data. This induces a slight distortion of the change in FRET versus temperature because FRET is not linearly dependent upon acceptor concentration, but as shown by Figs. S3 and S4, the level of FRET at highest temperature was similar in most cases even before normalization, minimizing the effect of this issue. Furthermore, normalization did not significantly affect the T mid or T end of thermal transition, as can be seen by comparing Fig. 1 to Fig. S3 and comparing Fig. 3 to Fig. S4 . Furthermore, in a previous study, we found that a twofold difference in FRET-acceptor concentration did not affect T mid and T end (25) . This was confirmed by comparing FRET with DPH as FRET donor and Rho-DOPE as FRET acceptor for symmetric vesicles with 1 and 2 mol% Rho-DOPE, which involves a much larger difference in FRET-acceptor concentrations than in almost all the asymmetric vesicle preparations. FRET with 1 and 2 mol% Rho-DOPE had very similar T mid and T end (Fig. S5) .",

Achieving this is complicated when carrying out lipid exchange. If FRET donor is incorporated into the lipid before lipid exchange, differences in vesicle yield could result in a different amount of FRET donor in the F and Fo samples after exchange. This would require an additional measurement to determine the amount of FRET donor (DPH) in the F and Fo samples (for example, by dissolving the vesicles in solvent to abolish FRET and then measuring DPH fluorescence to see how much DPH was in each sample). To avoid this and achieve equal amounts of FRET donor in F and Fo samples, DPH was added to the F samples and Fo samples after lipid exchange. In this protocol, F and Fo samples are first prepared without DPH, and then DPH, which binds very tightly to lipids ((29) and see Fig. S6 ), was added to the preformed asymmetric vesicles. It should be noted that even though the amount of DPH molecules is the same in F samples and Fo samples, because the yield of vesicles upon lipid exchange can vary a bit, the concentration of DPH in the membrane (i.e., the DPH/lipid ratio) could vary a bit using this protocol. However, FRET measured by donor quenching is independent of donor concentration in the bilayer. This is the case because the level of donor quenching due to FRET depends on how many quenchers are near any donor molecule, a parameter not affected by the membrane concentration of donors. This is a necessary property of FRET, and Fig. S7 confirms DPH concentration in the bilayer had no significant effect on FRET.",

The filtrates were dried under nitrogen followed by high vacuum for at least 3 h and then dissolved in chloroform-d (Sigma-Aldrich). Concentration was roughly estimated by dry weight to prepare samples in an NMR tube (Wilmad LabGlass, Buena, NJ) with $800 mM PC in 600 mL. NMR spectra were then acquired at 850 MHz with a 30 pulse (using a Bruker Ascend 850 MHz spectrometer; Bruker, Billerica, Ma), a delay time between acquisitions of 10 s to avoid signal saturation, and 32 acquisitions at 25 C. The fraction of saturated to total PCs in the sample was calculated by comparing the areas of the single proton attached to the position 2-carbon of glycerol at $5.2 ppm (found in both saturated and unsaturated PC; 1 proton/lipid) to that of the acyl-chain double-bond vinyl proton peaks at $5.4 ppm (found in unsaturated PCs only; four protons/DOPC). Percent saturated PC was calculated from the equation % saturated PC \u00bc (1 \u00c0 (area ratio of $5.4 ppm/$5.2 ppm)/4) \u00c2 100%.",

AUVs were prepared both with Rho-DOPE or with Rho-DMPE. To prepare AUVs with rhodamine-labeled PE in the inner leaflet, two exchange steps were carried out. To do this, donor vesicles in both steps contained 1:1 mSM:DOPC. In the first step, the acceptor vesicles contained DOPC with 35 mol% cholesterol plus an extra 4 mol% Rho-DMPE.

Trp only quenches rhodamine in the outer leaflet of vesicles because it is relatively membrane impermeable, as was confirmed using an osmotic swelling permeability assay ((31) and data not shown).

To label only the outer leaflet, 0.1 mol% TMADPH was externally added to preformed vesicle samples. Acceptor vesicles not subjected to exchange were used as the controls, having TMADPH in both leaflets. After preparation of the samples, initial TMADPH fluorescence intensity was measured (F\u00c0 intensity).

Lipids of donor MLVs were exchanged into the outer leaflet of the acceptor LUVs to prepare AUVs with donor lipids in the outer leaflet and acceptor lipids in the inner leaflet. Cholesterol in the acceptor LUVs does not interact with HPaCD (32,33) and remains in both leaflets (16) . AUVs were prepared with a mixture of various high-Tm sphingomyelins or saturated acyl-chain PCs (mSM, bSM, eSM, DMPC, di C 15:0 PC, DPPC, or DSPC) with DOPC-a low-Tm unsaturated acyl-chain lipid-in the outer leaflet, DOPC in the inner leaflet, and 35 mol% cholesterol distributed in both leaflets (designated as AUVs composed of X:DOPCo/DOPCi (35% CHOL), where X is SM or saturated acyl-chain PC). First, the conditions to give maximal exchange efficiency and yield were determined. With DOPC as the inner-leaflet lipid, a high concentration of cholesterol in the acceptor LUVs was needed to obtain a substantial yield of AUVs. A variety of SM/DOPC ratios were used in the donor vesicles to prepare AUVs with different amounts of SM in their outer leaflets. HP-TLC analysis was used to determine the % SM in AUV samples (Table 1) . mSM, bSM, and eSM had similar high levels of exchange, and because in most cases the SM/DOPC ratio in the outer leaflet of AUVs was higher than that originally in the donor vesicles, it appears that SM is preferentially exchanged into vesicles relative to DOPC (Table 1 ). The fact that these three species of SM had very similar levels of exchange suggests the length of the one acyl chain in SM did not have a marked effect on exchange efficiency.",

As shown by NMR (Table 1 ), the tendency is that the shorter the acyl chains of the saturated PCs, the higher the exchange efficiency.

Rho-DOPE localizes preferentially in disordered domains (25, 26, 34, 35) , whereas DPH under most conditions partitions nearly equally between the ordered and disordered phases (10, 36) . This results in decreased DPH to Rho-DOPE FRET (weak quenching of DPH fluorescence) when coexisting ordered and disordered domains are present in a membrane (25) . As temperature increases, ordered domains melt, in the sense that liquid ordered domains will convert to liquid disordered and the lipids in the liquid ordered and liquid disordered domains will mix homogeneously, gradually increasing energy transfer from DPH to Rho-DOPE (increasing quenching of DPH fluorescence). In this way, the thermal stability of the ordered domains can be determined by measuring FRET versus temperature (25, 26, 37) .

Fig. 1 A shows the behavior of vesicles containing DSPC, DOPC, and cholesterol. As temperature increased, FRET curves for both AUVs and symmetric LUVs with the same % DSPC as the AUVs' outer leaflet showed an apparent thermal transition, reflecting the conversion from a state with coexisting ordered and disordered domains to the homogeneous disordered state. The midpoint of the transition (T mid ) was at 32 C for the AUVs and 35 C for the symmetric vesicles, and the temperature at which the transition ended (T end ) was above 60 C for the AUVs and 50 C for the symmetric vesicles. This indicates that ordered domains in AUVs' outer leaflet and symmetric LUVs had similar thermal stabilities, although the transition appears to be slightly more gradual in the AUVs. (It should be noted that the thermal transition in the asymmetric vesicles was not quite complete at the highest temperature measured in this one case, but that this does not influence the conclusions). Fig. 1 B compares the FRET behavior of analogous AUVs and symmetric vesicles containing DPPC, DOPC, and cholesterol. In this case, there was a more marked difference in the thermal stability of ordered domains in AUVs and symmetric vesicles. The FRET curves are less complete in the experimental temperature range, which reduces the reliability of estimating T mid , but the difference in T mid (which is again higher for symmetric vesicles) appears to be $8 C. T end for AUVs was $35 C, whereas symmetric LUVs had a T end of $45 C. Combined, these show that the ordered domains in these AUVs are considerably less thermally stable than in the symmetric vesicles. Fig. 1 C compares the FRET behavior of AUVs and symmetric vesicles composed of di C 15:0 PC, DOPC, and cholesterol. T mid was below the experimental range, but T end of AUVs was in the range 20-25 C and for symmetric vesicles was close to 40 C. This shows that the difference between the thermal stability of ordered domains in the AUVs and symmetric vesicles was even larger than in vesicles with DPPC. Fig. 1 D compares the FRET behavior of AUVs and symmetric vesicles composed of DMPC, DOPC, and cholesterol. T mid was again below the experimental range, as was T end of AUVs, whereas T end for symmetric vesicles was 35-40 C. This indicates that DMPC is not able to form ordered domains in AUVs over the entire experimental range, indicating that ordered domains in these AUVs would be very unstable.",

To measure the physical state of the outer leaflet, the anisotropy probe TMADPH was used. This probe shows high anisotropy when in an ordered-state environment and low anisotropy when in a disordered-state environment (17, 18) . TMADPH has a cationic charge, so when added to preformed vesicles, it is only anchored to the outer leaflet (39) . To confirm that TMADPH selectively labeled the outer leaflet of AUVs, an MaCD-based extraction assay was developed (Fig. S11) . MaCD should be able to extract the TMADPH in the outer leaflet from the vesicles, whereas TMADPH in the inner leaflet should not be accessible to MaCD and therefore should not be extracted. When TMADPH was incorporated into the outer leaflet AUV by adding it to preformed vesicles, the maximal loss of fluorescence upon adding MaCD was 80% (Fig. S11) . This was consistent with its being fully in the outer leaflet, because TMADPH bound to cyclodextrin has only $20% of the fluorescence intensity it has when bound to lipid (40) . TMADPH was also incorporated into the acceptor vesicles before exchange and then removed from the outer leaflet during exchange to prepare vesicles with TMADPH in the inner leaflet. In this case, Fig. S11 shows that addition of MaCD only reduced fluorescence by 1-2%, indicating that almost all the TMADPH was anchored in the inner leaflet. Finally, Fig. S11 shows that in symmetric vesicles in which TMADPH was in both leaflets, the loss of fluorescence intensity upon adding MaCD was 25%, consistent with TMADPH being located in both leaflets, although not in equal amounts.",

Anisotropy increased as the % saturated PC in the symmetric vesicles increased (Fig. 2) .

Combined with the observation that in some lipid compositions, the outerleaflet high-Tm lipid induces inner-leaflet ordered-domain formation (16, 19) , this result indicates that strong coupling can have highly lipid-structure-dependent consequences on ordered-domain formation such that the physical state of either the outer or inner leaflet can predominate in both leaflets depending on lipid composition (see Discussion).",

Additional assays were used to confirm that after lipid exchange, the vesicles were asymmetric, and that asymmetry was stable. First, the movement of C 6 -NBD-PC across the bilayer of the DMPC:DOPCo/DOPCi (35% CHOL), DPPC:DOPCo/ DOPCi (35% CHOL), and mSM:DOPCo/DOPCi (35% CHOL) LUVs was measured (Fig. 4) . The C 6 -NBD-PC was introduced into the outer leaflet by including it in the donor lipid mixture or (mainly) restricted to the inner leaflet by including it in the acceptor lipid mixture and then removing it from the outer leaflet during the lipid exchange step (see schematic protocol in Fig. S14 ). Symmetric vesicles with C 6 -NBD-PC in both leaflets were also prepared. The fraction of C 6 -NBD-PC in the outer leaflet was then measured by assaying the fraction of NBD fluorescence bleached by addition of the membrane-impermeable agent sodium dithionite (NaDt) added externally to the vesicles (31, 42) . After adding NaDt into DOPC (35% CHOL) LUVs (acceptor LUVs before exchange) prepared with C 6 -NBD-PC in both leaflets, $50% of NBD fluorescence was bleached (Fig. 4, striped bars) . This result is consistent with C 6 -NBD-PC being localized equally in the inner and outer leaflets before lipid exchange. For AUVs with C 6 -NBD-PC only in the outer leaflet, Fig. 4 (filled bars) showed that 80-90% of NBD fluorescence was bleached, which means that over 80% of the C 6 -NBD-PC was located in the outer leaflet. The residual NBD fluorescence may reflect contamination of the AUVs with donor vesicles from the preparation procedure (see Materials and Methods). Another possibility is that some of the residual NBD fluorescence could be due to a small amount of C 6 -NBD-PC that flipped from outer to inner leaflet. This is less likely, because Fig. 4 also shows that the amount of NBD fluorescence protected from NaDt bleaching did not increase significantly after 2 days preincubation (note that this does not rule out a small amount of lipid flip during the exchange procedure itself). The amount of bleaching when the C 6 -NBD-PC was mainly in the inner leaflet also was not strongly dependent upon preincubation time. In this case, the bleaching observed ($20% of NBD fluorescence before preincubation) likely reflects incomplete removal of outer leaflet C 6 -NBD-PC during exchange.

Similar conclusions were derived from fluorescence anisotropy, which reflects the leaflet localization of the unlabeled lipids. Anisotropy of the AUVs prepared by lipid exchange was compared to that of symmetric LUVs with the same overall lipid composition (i.e., for LUVs with scrambled lipids). Previous studies have shown when AUVs have ordered domains in their outer leaflets but are less ordered in their inner leaflets, membrane order measured by TMADPH localized in the outer leaflet is higher than that measured by DPH (17, 18) , which localizes in both the inner and outer leaflets (43) . Table S1 shows this pattern is observed for AUVs (see column showing the ratio of % order measured by TMADPH to that measured by DPH) when DPPC or SM was introduced into the outer leaflet. In contrast, in prior studies for symmetric vesicles with domains and having the same overall lipid composition as AUVs, TMADPH reports lower membrane order than DPH because it partitions more weakly into ordered domains relative to disordered domains than does DPH (39) . In agreement with those studies, this pattern is seen for symmetric LUVs containing the same overall amount of DPPC or SM as in the corresponding AUVs prepared by lipid exchange (Table S1 ). The difference between AUVs and LUVs with scrambled lipids confirms that the AUVs are indeed asymmetric.",

Additional FRET experiments on DMPC-containing vesicles were in agreement with this and so further strengthen the conclusion that AUVs containing DMPC are indeed asymmetric. To be specific, in contrast to the AUVs containing DMPC, which do not form ordered domains, ordered domains formed in symmetric vesicles with the same overall composition as the AUVs (i.e., for LUVs identical to the AUVs except with scrambled lipids) (Fig. S15) .

To test this, Trp quenching of rhodamine was used. Trp has been shown to be an efficient quencher for several organic dyes, including rhodamine derivatives (44) , and is relatively membrane impermeable (see Materials and Methods). Vesicles were prepared with rhodamine lipid (Rho-DOPE or Rho-DMPE) exchanged into the outer leaflet, or (using Rho-DMPE) removed selectively from the outer leaflet by lipid exchange. (Because of especially inefficient exchange of Rho-DOPE, it was necessary to use Rho-DMPE to selectively label the inner leaflet. Even so, two rounds of exchange were needed to remove most of the outer leaflet Rho-DMPE (see Fig. S16) ). As expected, the quenching of rhodamine by Trp added externally to the vesicles was strong when the rhodamine lipid was in the outer leaflet, weak when it was mainly in the inner leaflet, and intermediate when it was located in both leaflets (Fig. S16) . The residual quenching in samples labeled in the inner leaflet likely reflects incomplete removal of outer-leaflet rhodamine lipid. The conclusion that the rhodamine lipid does not rapidly flip between the leaflets was confirmed by the observation that quenching showed very little change in samples preincubated for 2 days before Trp addition. If the rhodamine lipid was flipping across the bilayer with a half-time faster than days, the difference in quenching of inner-and outer-leaflet samples should have largely disappeared after two days.",

Potentially, there might be many variations in the effect of interleaflet interaction/ coupling in terms of which leaflet dominates bilayer physical behavior, a few of which we previously described (18) . Coupling dominance in asymmetric vesicles refers to a phenomenon that occurs when there is strong coupling of physical states in two leaflets. By coupling dominance, we mean the degree to which the physical state of the inner or outer leaflet ''by itself'' is found to be the predominant physical state in the opposite leaflet. In other words, in an asymmetric vesicle containing a high extent of coupling with an outer leaflet composed of a lipid mixture that would form ordered domains by itself and an inner leaflet composed of a lipid mixture that would not form ordered domains by itself, whether both leaflets are in an ordered state or both in a disordered state would define which leaflet is dominant. If the inner leaflet formed ordered domains, it would mean that the outer leaflet was dominant, whereas if the outer leaflet did not form ordered domains, it would mean the inner leaflet was dominant. Fig. 5 shows a range of possible variations in interleaflet coupling extent and dominance for lipid bilayers in which (to oversimplify) the lipids in the inner and outer leaflet undergo an ordered-to-disordered (melting) transition at different temperatures. If there is no coupling of physical state, i.e., the extent of coupling is zero, or the energy of coupling is very low, the leaflets should melt close to the same temperature as they would in a bilayer composed of only outer-or only inner-leaflet lipids (model A). If there is tight/strong interleaflet coupling, i.e., the extent of coupling is high so that the physical state of the two leaflets is the same at all temperatures, one would predict that the melting transition would be at an intermediate temperature, which might be at an average temperature (model B) or instead be closer to the melting temperature for the outer or inner leaflet, depending on which leaflet dominates physical properties (models C-D). There could also be partial coupling, in which the inner and outer leaflets are coupled only over a limited temperature range (model E).",

In other words, this is a case in which there is no dominance of one leaflet over the other. Not illustrated are the cases in which there is partial dominance such that 1) the leaflet with a composition that by itself would form an ordered state in symmetric vesicles induces the formation of a partly ordered state in an opposite leaflet that by itself would form a disordered state in symmetric vesicles or 2) the leaflet with a composition that would by itself form an disordered state in symmetric vesicles induces the formation of a partly ordered state in an opposite leaflet that by itself would form a fully ordered state in symmetric vesicles.

The induction of ordered domains in one leaflet arising from ordered domains in the opposite leaflet has been reported in some lipid compositions (15, 16, (19) (20) (21) 45) , whereas in other cases, loosening or destruction of ordered domains by when a disordered state is present in the opposite leaflet has been reported (47, 49) . However, it must be pointed out that studies using light microscopy fail to detect domain formation if only nanosized domains form or if the partition properties of the fluorescent probe chosen are insufficient to detect when domains form in some lipid compositions. Residual solvent effects may also have confounded some of the conclusions in prior studies. In this regard, the FRET system and asymmetric vesicles used in this study give more unambiguous results.",

            "text": "Here, a systematic study of the influence of lipid structure on interleaflet coupling in cholesterol-containing AUVs was initiated, using FRET so that submicroscopic domains could be detected. The behavior of outer-leaflet ordered domains in AUVs containing SM was consistent with our prior studies, showing that at moderate-to-high SM levels in the outer leaflet, outer-leaflet ordered domains form and are as stable or nearly as stable as those in symmetric vesicles with the same amount of SM in each leaflet as in the outer leaflet of the AUVs (17, 18) . It is interesting that ordered domains were detected in AUVs with bSM. Brain SM has an acyl-chain composition that tends to form nanodomains rather than macroscopic domains in symmetric vesicles (24) . We previously noted that in asymmetric giant unilamellar vesicles, any ordered domains that might have been present were not large enough to detect by microscopy in bSM:DOPCo/DOPCi (37% CHOL), even though such domains were easily visualized in asymmetric giant unilamellar vesicles containing mSM and eSM, which have acyl-chain compositions differing from that of bSM (16) . Thus, this study illustrates the utility of FRET for detecting nanoscale lipid domains in AUVs. That ordered domains formed by bSM would have to be submicroscopic has also been reported for asymmetric supported planar bilayers (50) . The FRET experiments in our study also show that ordered domains in asymmetric vesicles composed of bSM:DOPCo/DOPCi (35% CHOL) LUVs have a similar thermal stability as in asymmetric vesicles composed of mSM:DOPCo/DOPCi (35% CHOL). In other words, differences in ordered-domain size in AUVs may not be linked to differences in ordered-domain thermal stability, similar to what has been seen in symmetric LUVs (25, 26) .",

Ordered-to-disordered transition is dominated by the high-Tm-lipid-containing outer leaflet, and the transition temperature is close to that in lipid vesicles composed of outer-leaflet lipids. (E) Intermediate/partial coupling, in which coupling is strong/complete at lower temperature but the physical state of leaflets uncouples at higher temperatures, is shown. exchange of a specific acyl-chain length could potentially alter the acyl-chain composition of the SM in the asymmetric vesicles relative to that in the original SM mixture.

We propose that in these cases, the disordered state present in the inner leaflet destabilizes outer-leaflet ordered domains, indicative of tight interleaflet coupling in which the disordered leaflet dominates physical behavior of the outer leaflet. This is consistent with our recent collaborative study carried out in vesicles lacking cholesterol, showing that a disordered inner leaflet can partially fluidize ordered outer-leaflet domains via coupling (49) , but contrasts with other cases (noted above) in which the leaflet with high-Tm lipids dominates physical behavior (16, (19) (20) (21) .",

The results of this study identify two such factors: the lipid acyl-chain length and amount of high-Tm lipid. Both shorter acyl chains and a lower fraction of high-Tm lipid are known to decrease the ''melting'' temperature of ordered domains in a symmetric bilayer. In other words, both factors decrease the stability of the ordered state relative to the disordered state.

It is possible that changes in high-Tm lipid acyl-chain composition or high-Tm lipid content could have large effects on membrane domain formation in vivo such that with relatively small changes in lipid structure or composition, changes in membrane organization forming or destroying membrane domains could occur.

Net flow of cholesterol between leaflets also may have a significant influence on coupling. Although cyclodextrin-catalyzed lipid exchange seems to maintain lipid balance between leaflets (18, 19, 27, 51) , a small net deficit or surplus of outer-leaflet lipid could result from exchange. This could be balanced out by a movement of cholesterol toward the leaflet with a lipid deficit and/or an imbalance between inner-and outer-leaflet lipid that could affect lipid packing in the more crowded and less crowded leaflets, especially when cholesterol is not present. It will be important in future studies to explore a much wider range of membrane compositions and to develop approaches to detect domain formation in the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer.",

The physical state of the leaflet with some amount of a high-Tm lipid (outer leaflet) is shown as a solid line and that of the opposite leaflet (inner leaflet) that lacks high-Tm lipid by a dashed line. The positions of the numbers 1 and 2 represent the Tm values for the inner-leaflet lipids (i) and outer-leaflet lipids (o), respectively, in symmetric vesicles composed of only inner-leaflet or only outer-leaflet lipids. (A) Uncoupled leaflets are shown. Inner or outer leaflets undergo an ordered to disordered melting transition at about the same temperature in symmetric vesicles containing only high-Tm lipid or only the low-Tm lipid. (B-D) Strong coupling/high extent of coupling is shown. Outer and inner leaflets exist in the same physical state as each other at all temperatures. (B) Ordered-to-disordered transition temperature is influenced by both leaflets and is close to the average for the innerand outer-leaflet lipids. (C) The inner leaflet dominates physical properties.",

NMR analysis of % saturated PC in the bilayer vesicles was calculated as described in Materials and Methods. Calculated outer-leaflet values assume donor lipids are delivered only to the outer leaflet and that the outer leaflet contains 52% of total vesicle lipid, as predicted for vesicles of $130 nm diameter. Average and SD values are from three to six experiments (number shown in parentheses).The 10-15 mol% of Rho-DOPE in donor MLVs quenches DPH fluorescence six-to ninefold relative to that of DPH in AUVs (data not shown), which would reduce the contribution of contaminating donor vesicles to DPH fluorescence to 1-2% in the AUV samples. For fluorescence anisotropy measurements, $10% donor contamination may have had a small influence on the results, but the agreement with FRET indicates this was negligible.",
