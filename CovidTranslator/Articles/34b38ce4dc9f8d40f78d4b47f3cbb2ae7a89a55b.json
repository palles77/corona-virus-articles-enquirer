            "text": "The accumulation of [3H]noradrenaline ([3H]NA) and its oxidation products was studied in primary cultures of cerebral astrocytes. Astroglial accumulation of radiolabeled catecholamine ([3H] NA and oxidation products) was enhanced by manganese or iron, but it was inhibited by unlabeled NA, dopamine or ascorbate. Tissue:medium ratios of radioactivity increased as extracellular [3H]NA was oxidized. When extracellular oxidation was prevented by ascorbate, as confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, either ouabain pretreatment or nominally Na*-free incubation medium inhibited approximately one-half of specific [3H]NA accumulation by rat (but not mouse) astrocytes. These observations suggest that neurological responses to trace metals and ascorbate may arise from the effects of these agents on the clearance of extracellular catecholamines. Astrocytes can accumulate oxidation products of NA more rapidly than they take up NA itself, but ascorbate at physiological concentrations prevents the oxidation process in extracellular fluid. Furthermore, in the presence of ascorbate, Na+-dependent transport mediates a significant component of NA accumulation in rat astrocytes.",

            "text": "Termination of the neurobiological actions of catecholamines in brain is associated with binding and uptake of the transmitters and their metabolites by cells. Brain astrocytes are located around synapses and at the periphery of capillaries, so their uptake systems likely are important for regulating the neural environment. The presence in astrocytes of a system for catecholamine clearance was suggested by the observation of high-affinity, Na+-dependent [3H]noradrenaline ([3H]NA) uptake in rat astroglial cultures (1) (2) (3) (4) . However, other workers failed to confirm this observation (5, 6) . A possible problem in carrying out [3H]NA uptake experiments arises from the tendency of the catecholamine to oxidize in I Department of Physiology, The University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada N6A 5C1. aqueous solutions at physiological pH. NA oxidation products polymerize to form neuromelanin (7) (8) (9) , which has been observed to accumulate within cerebral astrocytes in situ (10, 11) and in primary culture (12) . Ascorbate is stored in brain within neurosecretory granules and secreted with catecholamines, with the result that its concentration in extracellular fluid can rise to about 500 IxM when catecholaminergic neurotransmission is stimulated (13) . The vitamin may modulate neurotransmission since it has been found to alter catecholamine-mediated behaviors (14) (15) (16) . In preliminary experiments, we found that ascorbate inhibits accumulation (binding and uptake) of radioactivity by mouse astroglial cultures incubated with [3H]NA (17) (18) (19) . This finding was consistent with in situ studies of rat and guinea pig, which showed that turnover rates for brain NA vary inversely with changes in ascorbate concentration (20, 21) . We hypothesized that this physiological 1199 effect of ascorbate might be attributable to its antioxidant properties. However, our observation that ascorbate and unlabeled NA inhibit the same component of radiotracer accumulation when mouse astrocytes are incubated with [3H]NA (19) appeared inconsistent with a report that ascorbate does not affect the Na+-dependent component of [3H]NA uptake in rat astrocytes (4) . Therefore, the present study investigates the mechanism by which ascorbate alters catecholamine clearance in astroglial cultures. Our results indicate that physiological concentrations of ascorbate prevent NA oxidation and that, in the presence of this antioxidant, a significant component of NA uptake by rat astroglial cultures is Na+-dependent.",

There were no marked effects on cell integrity since [~4C]sorbitol space was not changed by either NA or ascorbate ( Figure 1 ). Astrocytes cultured for 2, 3 or 4 weeks all showed similar effects of ascorbate.

Therefore, [3H]NA uptake in the presence of ascorbate was studied in rat astrocytes cultured in fetal bovine serum ( Figure  4 ) or horse serum ( Figure 5 ). Lowering the incubation temperature from 37~ to 4~ inhibited accumulation of tritiated catecholamine to the same as did adding 1 mM unlabeled NA. Nonsaturable accumulation was measured in the presence of excess (1 mM) unlabeled NA and was subtracted from the total accumulation of radiotracer to determine specific uptake. It was observed in each rat astroglial model that, during 1 min incubations, specific [3H]NA uptake was approximately onehalf of total [3H]NA accumulation (Figures 4 and 5) . The Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor, ouabain (0.5 mM), was used to test the effect of elevated intracellular Na \u00a7 on the specific component of rat astroglial [3H]NA uptake measured in the presence of ascorbate. Direct interaction of ouabain with the NA carrier was ruled out by finding no effect on specific [aH]NA uptake when astrocytes were exposed to the drug only during the 1 min [3H]NA uptake incubation (data not shown). However, preincubation with ouabain for 2 h significantly inhibited subsequent [3H]NA accumulation by polygonal and stellate astrocytes, whether the ceils had been cultured with fetal bovine serum (Figure 4 ) or horse serum ( Figure 5 ). Approximately one-half of the initial rate of specific [3H]NA uptake in rat astrocytes was inhibited by ouabain pretreatment (Figures 4 and 5) .",

Ascorbate, which reduces ferric (Fe 3 \u00a7 iron to the ferrous (Fe 2 \u00a7 state (38) and prevents [3H]NA oxidation, inhibited the stimulatory effect of iron on radiotracer accumulation.

Neuromelanin accumulates into cytoplasmic granules within astrocytes both in culture (12) and in situ (10, 11) .

However, investigations in other laboratories failed to confirm the presence of Na+-dependent catecholamine transport in astrocytes (5, 6) . Unlike the present experiments, tests of Na \u00a7 catecholamine transport were carried out after preincubation of the cultures with pargyline and tropolone (100 IxM), to inhibit monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyltransferase, respectively (1, 6) . In the present experiments, pargyline and tropolone did not increase initial rates of astroglial [3H]NA accumulation, perhaps because of a relatively short (1 min) incubation period during the [3H]NA transport assay, a period that was selected in order to ensure that oxidation remained negligible. Another methodological difference involves ascorbate concentrations, which were lower in the present experiments than the supraphysiological (1 mM) concentration employed by others (1, 3) .",

In turn, approximately one-half of this specific [3H]NA uptake was sensitive to ouabain pretreatment or incubation in nominally Na+-free medium. This Na+-dependent component was present in both of the rat astrogliaI models investigated, namely, those cultured in fetal bovine serum (Figure 4 ) or horse serum ( Figure 5 ). Furthermore, the presence of Na+-dependent [3H]NA uptake did not depend on a unique method of preparing astroglial cultures, since our culturing procedure (22, 25) differed from the one previously used to show Na +dependence (1-3).
