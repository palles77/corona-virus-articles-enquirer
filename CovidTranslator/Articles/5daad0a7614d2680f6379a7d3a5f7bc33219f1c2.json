They have multiple WD40-repeats. RACK1 (guanine nucleotide-binding protein beta-2-like 1, 317aa) is implicated in numerous signalling pathways. In plants RACK genes are regulators of development and RACK1 proteins regulate innate immunity by interacting with multiple proteins in the Rac1 immune complex in rice. organisms (Hrad1 from man, Mrad1 from mouse, RAD17 from S. cerevisiae). (4) See rad proteins. rad proteins Yeast proteins coded by genes originally identified as being particularly sensitive to X-rays, many of which are involved in DNA repair and required for spontaneous and induced mitotic recombination, meiotic recombination and matingtype switching. Human homologues of many of these proteins were subsequently identified. Rad21 (double-strand-break repair protein, 631aa) is a component of the cohesin complex that is proteolytically cleaved at the metaphase-anaphase transition by separin, allowing sister chromatids to separate. Rad23 (398aa in S. cerevisiae) is important in nucleotide excision repair; the N-terminal domain has similarity with ubiquitin and links rad23 to the proteasome. It binds to rad14 and TFIIH and forms a stable complex with rad4. Rad51 (400aa in S. cerevisiae, 339 in humans) is the functional homologue of recA and promotes ATP-dependent homologous pairing and DNA strand exchange; binds Rad52. The role of these proteins in DNA repair means that mutations are associated with tumour susceptibility. The ras-related rab proteins are involved in vesicular traffic and the number of identified variants is increasing rapidly.

The binding affinity of repressors for the operator may be affected by other molecules. Inducers bind to repressors and decrease their binding to the operator, while co-repressors increase the binding. The archetype of repressor proteins is the lactose repressor protein that acts on the lac operon and for which the inducers are \u03b2-galactosides such as lactose; it is a polypeptide of 360aa that is active as a tetramer. Other examples are the \u03bb repressor protein of lambda bacteriophage that prevents the transcription of the genes required for the lytic cycle leading to lysogeny, and the cro protein, also of lambda, which represses the transcription of the \u03bb repressor protein establishing the lytic cycle. Both of these are active as dimers and have a common structural feature, the helix-turn-helix motif, that is thought to bind to DNA with the helices fitting into adjacent major grooves.",

This form of respiration may be anaerobic as in glycolysis, or aerobic in the case of oxidations operating via the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the electron transport chain. restriction enzymes Class of bacterial enzymes (restriction endonucleases) that cut DNA at specific sites. In bacteria their function is to destroy foreign DNA, such as that of bacteriophages (host DNA is specifically modified and protected by methylation at these sites). Type I restriction endonucleases occur as a complex with the methylase and a polypeptide that binds to the recognition site on DNA. They are often not very specific and cut at a remote site. Type II restriction endonucleases are the classic experimental tools. They have very specific recognition and cutting sites. The recognition sites are short, 428 nucleotides, and are usually palindromic sequences. Because both strands have the same sequence running in opposite directions the enzymes make double-stranded breaks, which, if the site of cleavage is off-centre, generates fragments with short single-stranded tails; these can hybridize to the tails of other fragments and are called sticky ends. They are generally named according to the bacterium from which they were isolated (first letter of genus name and the first two letters of the specific name). The bacterial strain is identified next and multiple enzymes are given Roman numerals. For example the two enzymes isolated from the R strain of E. coli are designated Eco RI and Eco RII. The more commonly used restriction endonucleases are shown in retention signal The sequence of amino acids on proteins that indicates that they are to be retained in the secretory processing system, for example the Golgi apparatus, and not passed on and released. Can be applied to any similar situation in which sorting of macromolecules into different compartments occurs. The carboxy-terminal tetrapeptide KDEL sequence is an important retrieval sequence for retention in the mammalian ER (HDEL in yeast). reticular dysgenesis One of the rarest and most severe forms of combined immunodeficiency caused by mutation in the mitochondrial adenylate kinase-2 gene.

In vertebrates, looking from outside, there are four major cell layers: (i) the outer neural retina, which contains neurons (ganglion cells, amacrine cells, bipolar cells) as well as blood vessels; (ii) the photoreceptor layer, a single layer of rods and cones; (iii) the pigmented retinal epithelium (PRE or RPE); (iv) the choroid, composed of connective tissue, fibroblasts, and including a well-vascularised layer, the chorio capillaris, underlying the basal lamina of the PRE. Behind the choroid is the sclera, a thick organ capsule. See retinal rods, retinal cones, rhodopsin. In molluscs (especially cephalopods such as the squid) the retina has the light-sensitive cells as the outer layer with the neural and supporting tissues below. retinal cone A light-sensitive cell type of the retina, that, unlike retinal rods, is differentially sensitive to particular wavelengths of light, and is important for colour vision. In the human eye there are three types of cones, sensitive respectively to long wavelengths (5642580 nm, yellow), mediumwavelengths (5342545 nm, green) and shorter wavelengths (4202440 nm, violet). Defects can lead to colour blindness. They are concentrated in the fovea and are important for high-acuity vision. The membrane infoldings of the outer segment are incompletely separated in cones. retinal rod Major photoreceptor cell of the vertebrate retina, columnar cells (about 40 \u03bcm long, 1 \u03bcm diameter) having three distinct regions: a region adjacent to, and synapsed with, the neural layer of the retina contains the nucleus and other cytoplasmic organelles, below this is the inner segment, rich in mitochondria, connected through a thin neck to the outer segment which consists of a stack of discs (membrane infoldings) that are continually replenished near the inner segment and that are shed from the distal end and phagocytosed by the pigmented epithelium. The membranes of the discs are rich in rhodopsin which undergoes a conformational change when it absorbs light and triggers a cascade of amplification reactions that eventually produce a depolarization. The thin linking region betwen the inner and outer segments contains a ciliary body, There are about 125 million rods in a human eye, more in the peripheral areas; they are responsible for vision at low light levels. retino-tectal connection The developmental process in which nerve fibres from the developing retina are mapped on to the tectum of the brain. There seems to be a good positioning system in operation, and a variety of mechanisms probably operate, including control of the fasciculation of fibres in the optic nerve, and some specific recognition of the correct target area by the nerve growth cone.",

Article: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/ PMC314022/ R-type channels A class of neuronal voltage-sensitive calcium channels of the 'high-voltage activated' (HVA) group that are blocked by nickel, and partially by omega-agatoxin-IIIA but are unaffected by dihydropyridines, phenylalkylamines and conotoxins. The alpha subunit is alpha-1E (2313aa), the beta and alpha-2/delta subunits regulate the activity. Thought to carry much of the current, stimulated by glutamate release in response to ischaemia, that induces neuronal death.rubidium Rb One of the alkali earth metals, used to substitute for potassium in some ion flux experiments.Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome A syndrome of mental retardation and morphological abnormalities that can be caused by mutation in the gene encoding CREB-binding protein or in the EP300 gene (see p300). ruffles Projections at the leading edge of a crawling cell. In time lapse films the active edge appears to ruffle. The protrusions are apparently supported by a microfilament meshwork, and can move centripetally over the dorsal surface of a cell in culture.",

The runt domain is found in a range of transcription factors such as Runx.Runx A family of transcription factors containing a runt domain. Chromosomal aberrations involving Runx1 (runt-related transcription factor-1, 453aa) are associated with a variety of disorder such as acute myelogenous leukaemia and some platelet disorders. Runx2 (521aa) is a global regulator of osteoblast differentiation, expressed several days before Russell-Silver syndrome A growth retardation disorder (Silver-Russell dwarfism ) caused by epigenetic changes of DNA hypomethylation at the telomeric imprinting control region (ICR1) on chromosome 11p15, involving the H19 and IGF2 genes. rutabaga Drosophila memory mutant; gene codes for calcium/calmodulin-responsive adenylyl cyclase (2248aa); net result is elevated cAMP levels and a comparable behavioural defect to dunce. ruthenium red A stain used in electron microscopy for acid mucopolysaccharides on cell surfaces. Also binds tightly to tubulin dimers and the ryanodine receptor.rutin A phenolic compound produced as a defensive secondary metabolite by plants; it has generalized detrimental effects on herbivores and pathogens.RXL motif Cy motif A hydrophobic region on some cyclin substrates that enhances the binding interaction with a hydrophobic region on the cyclin (although is neither necessary nor sufficient).ryanodine Drug that blocks the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle. Ryanodine-binding proteins have also been found in the CNS. The water-soluble plant extract ryania from the powdered stem of the tropical shrub Ryania speciosa has been used as an insecticide. The extract contains several structurally related ryanoids including ryanodine. See ryanodine receptor.ryanodine receptor RyR Large transmembrane proteins that form tetrameric Ca 21 channels in association with 4 calstabin molecules which release calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol during muscle contraction. They are stimulated to transport Ca 21 into the cytosol by recognizing Ca 21 on the cytosolic side of the SR (calcium-induced calcium release) a positive feedback that leads to a rapid response. There are tissuespecific isoforms (skeletal muscle (RyR1, 5032aa) in skeletal muscle, RyR2 (4965aa) in cardiac muscle and RyR3 (4872aa) in brain. Show sequence similarity with InsP 3 -gated calcium channels of the endoplasmic reticulum but are pharmacologically distinct. RyR1 mutations are associated with malignant hyperthermia.ryk In atypical receptor protein tyrosine kinase (604aa) that is a coreceptor along with Frizzled for Wnt ligands and binds to dishevelled, through which it activates the canonical Wnt pathway.",
