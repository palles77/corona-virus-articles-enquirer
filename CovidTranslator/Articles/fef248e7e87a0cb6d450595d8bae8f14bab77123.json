We conducted a systematic literature review to describe current research in the area of communication to the public in public health emergency preparedness, focusing on the association between sociodemographic and behavioral factors and communication as well as preparedness outcomes. Articles were searched in PubMed and Embase and reviewed by 2 independent reviewers. A total of 131 articles were included for final review. Fifty-three percent of the articles were empirical, of which 74% were populationbased studies, and 26% used information environment analysis techniques. None had an experimental study design.",

            "text": "M embers of racial and ethnic minorities and underserved population groups suffer disproportionately from the consequences of disasters and emergencies. The reasons for this are varied and complex, but they include limited access to resources that can help people to take action during an emergency, culture and language barriers, lower perceived personal risk, distrust of authorities, lack of preparation and protective action, and frequent reliance on informal sources of information. 1, 2 Central to these factors, we argue, is the phenomenon of communi-cation inequalities, which we define as differences among individuals and social groups in accessing and using health information and the resultant impact on knowledge and behaviors. [2] [3] [4] While a solid body of work in social epidemiology has documented a connection between social determinants such as socioeconomic position, race, and ethnicity and health outcomes, the mechanisms linking the 2 have been less clear. Viswanath and colleagues developed an explanatory framework of how inequalities in public health emergency preparedness outcomes attributable to social determinants could potentially be explained by inequalities on various dimensions of public health emergency preparedness. 5 The framework is summarized by the Structural Influence Model (SIM) of preparedness communication depicted in Figure 1 . 5 The model is a heuristic framework developed to link social determinants with preparedness outcomes through public health emergency preparedness communications. The framework was originally developed in the context of health communication 5 and subsequently adopted to public health emergency preparedness communication to the public. 6 Communication to the public is critically important in public health emergency preparedness. It is one of 15 public health emergency preparedness capabilities developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): ''Public Information and Warning.'' 7 During a crisis, federal, state, and local public health agencies are typically engaged in a variety of public information efforts to inform the population, encourage the adoption of preventive behaviors, and limit the adverse impacts of specific events. Yet, individuals and groups may not be able to access and use some of the resources offered to them, including information on health and specific threats, because of existing social inequalities, including socioeconomic position, race, ethnicity, and physical and mental health disabilities, among others. 8 Emergencies, including disasters, also can lead to longterm disparities, even controlling for predisaster socioeconomic status, as a study of Hurricane Katrina showed. 9 These disparities are also found among nations. For ex-ample, a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) study showed that the adverse consequences of disasters, such as mortality, are greater among countries with low income, low life expectancy, and less education. 10 In contrast, advanced countries with higher income and education and more stable governance suffer fewer losses in disasters. 9 Poorer households tend to have poorer coping strategies and suffer consequences over the longer term. 11 In an analysis, Kim showed that poor people are more likely than nonpoor people to be exposed to disasters and that the poor are much more likely to be concentrated in disasterprone areas, highlighting the importance of public health emergency preparedness communications. 6 During an emergency, a number of psychosocial as well as social factors influence action, even when information about a probable hazard is available and promptly communicated to the public. For example, Mexican Americans often have delayed responses to natural emergencies because of the time they spend in trying to communicate with their extended families. 12 Hearing impairment may leave elderly people more vulnerable to information processing and cause difficulty in understanding evacuation orders, 13 and individuals with low literacy may be challenged in interpreting written messages and are likely to benefit from preparedness resources that are easy to read and visually appropriate. 14 Given the importance of communicating to the public in public health emergency preparedness, it is important to examine the extent to which this issue has received attention from the scientific community. The goal of this project was to conduct a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe current research in public communication in public health emergency preparedness, with a particular focus on communication inequalities and their association with communication and preparedness outcomes. This review examines the relationship among sociodemographics, behavioral characteristics, and communication outcomes in public health emergency preparedness.",

Therefore, in order to develop more specific search criteria, all articles of the 2009 volumes of the American Journal of Public Health (AJPH), Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness, Journal of Health Communication, American Journal of Disaster Medicine, and Public Health Reports were manually scanned to produce a list of key words. By combining these key words with a previous strategy developed by Savoia et al, 17 a new combination of terms was created to identify the articles of interest (see Figure 2 ). The 5 journals cited above were selected because of the importance of including journals with both a broad public health scope (ie, AJPH and Public Health Reports) and a specific focus on emergency preparedness or health communication. Subsequently, the new search methodology was applied to PubMed and Embase, selecting the year 2009 and the journals listed above.",

The majority of the articles were published by authors whose main affiliation was with institutions in the United States (57%), followed by the United Kingdom (9%), and Canada (7%). Among types of emergencies studied, most focused on infectious disease outbreaks (55%), followed by all-hazards (14%), terrorism or bioterrorism (17%), natural disasters (8%), radiological incidents (4%), and other causes (3%). Authors from US institutions were the only ones who studied communication issues during bioterrorism or terrorism attacks and chemical and radiological disasters or that used an all-hazards approach, whereas researchers from other countries focused mostly on infectious disease outbreaks and natural disasters such as weather-related incidents and wildfires. Fifty-three percent of articles were empirical (data based), and the rest (47%) were nonempirical studies (editorials or commentaries). We noticed an increase in empirical studies during and after the H1N1 pandemic: 36% of the empirical studies were conducted during and after 2009 and looked at the response to the pandemic, whereas only 16% of the nonempirical studies were related to the H1N1 pandemic. Seventy-four percent of the empirical studies were population based, and 26% used information environment analysis techniques, which consist of a systematic analysis of messages about public health emergencies covered in different media such as news or entertainment (also known as ''media content analysis''). None of the studies had an experimental study design, which is understandable, as most studies are done during or after emergencies, making it difficult to have control groups. The distribution of the articles and their characteristics are described in Figure 3 .",

The majority of the studies (72%) were focused on the response to infectious disease outbreaks, and about half of them (44%) were conducted in the US. These articles analyzed the content covered by news media, including traditional print newspaper articles, television/online news reports, and websites developed by government agencies in preparation for or response to a specific threat. In such studies, the analysis of the accuracy and quality of news reporting and the potential impact of media coverage on public risk perceptions and behaviors were typically discussed. Only 22% of these analyses were based on a prospective study design, all of which were performed during the unfolding of the H1N1 pandemic. These studies suggest how data derived from the analysis of the information environment may inform public health officials on how messages are filtered or further elaborated by the media, and how the availability of such information, in the midst of a crisis, may be critical to improving public officials' ability to better target their messages.

            "text": "Most of the literature focused on the role of risk and crisis communication and on the difficulty of informing, educating, and sometimes persuading the general population to embrace preventive behaviors. 20, 21, 33 Emphasis has been on the importance of population trust in the source of information and on the vehicle or medium through which the information is delivered. 4, 21, 34, 35 Although several types of communication outcomes have been investigatedincluding information exposure, information-seeking behaviors, and information processing and use-only a few studies have looked at population sociodemographic characteristics and behaviors as determinants of public health emergency preparedness communication outcomes. Population-based studies are rarely supported by theoretical models, and most of them rely on cross-sectional study designs in which data are typically gathered from nonrepresentative samples of the population under investigation. However, the few population-based studies being published show consistent results on how factors such as socioeconomic position, race/ethnicity, language spoken at home, and place of residence have an impact on people's ability to get ready for an emergency and respond to specific incidents. 21, 23, 36 Behavioral characteristics such as self-efficacy and perceived norm, preexisting beliefs, willingness to comply with recommended measures, and trust in the government are also associated with the way preventive messages will be received and understood by specific segments of the general public. 18, 26, 34, 37, 38 The Structural Influence Model was well suited to the purpose of identifying what variables were studied the most, showing how this model well reflects current knowledge in this topic area. Among the social determinants listed in the model, ''social networks'' have been rarely investigated as well as physical or mental disabilities and their relationship with communication outcomes. Socioeconomic position has been investigated by several studies, but the definition and measurement of socioeconomic position have not been consistently used. In terms of communication outcomes, ''information processing'' has been investigated the least; experimental studies on this outcome will be useful to better understand the effectiveness of specific communication messages.",

The rapid change in the information delivery platforms and the complexity of the information environment demand that communications during emergencies be accurate and quick. Authorities have to be agile and nimble to understand the needs of the audience, to reduce uncertainty and panic, and to facilitate action. This requires sound empirical knowledge that can inform how people learn about emergencies as well as the factors that influence their learning and that influence how people act or do not act during a crisis. While theoretical essays are useful in providing a framework, it is vital that we develop a more solid evidence base warranting more empirical studies.",
