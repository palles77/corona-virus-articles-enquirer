Co-cultivation of MHV-nonpermissive hamster BHK cells devoid of mouse Bgp with mouse DBT cells infected with MHV-A59 or JHMV induces syncytia formation on BHK cells (Bgp-independent fusion). This study shows the difference in Bgp-independent fusion activity among various MHV strains. Under a phase contrast microscopy, JHMV (cl-2, sp-4) induced the Bgpindependent syncytia on BHK cells similar to those observed on DBT cells, while such syncytia were not seen with the infection of other MHV strains (MHV-1, MHV-3, MHV-A59, MHV-S, srr7, srr11 and srr18). Tiny syncytia detectable only by immunofluorescence were produced with the latter MHV strains except for srr7 which failed to produce syncytia. MHVs except for srr7 grew in BHK cells after Bgp-independent infection. The Bgp-independent fusion by JHMV was inhibited either by anti-S1 or anti-S2 antibodies. These results showed that the JHMV spike protein had a remarkably high Bgp-independent fusion activity. * Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) belongs to coronaviruses that are enveloped, positive stranded RNA viruses [24] . A variety of strains are included in MHV and they show different organ tropism and type of disease [20] . MHV has a genome with about 31 kilobases which encodes 4 to 5 structural proteins and several non-structural proteins [24] .",

Of these the amino acid sequences of A59 [15] and JHMV cl-2 [29] S proteins have been reported. Sp-4 S has a 141-amino acid deletion in the hypervariable region of the cl-2 S1 [23] . Srr 7 and srr18 have amino acid mutations at positions 1114(Leu\u2192Phe) and 1163(Cys\u2192His) in the S2, respectively. Srr 11 has a mutation at position of 65 (Leu\u2192His) in the S1. To see the Bgp-independent fusion activity, DBT cells cultured in 12 well-plate (Corning) were infected with those viruses at an m.o.i. 1 and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h. After 3 times of washing with Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (DMEM, Nissui, Tokyo), infected cells were cultured in 1 ml of DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS, Gibco) for 3 to 4 h. The cells were then trypsinized and 10 4 cells were overlaid onto BHK cell monolayer cultured in 12 well-plate (1 \u00d7 10 6 cells). The syncytia of BHK cells were examined by a phase contrast microscopy during 48 h after overlay of MHV-infected DBT cells. Viral antigen was also examined by immunofluorescence using anti-S1 MAbs [11] . Only JHMV cl-2 and sp-4 induced the Bgp-independent syncytia on BHK cells detectable by a phase contrast microscopy. The syncytia could be observed from about 12 h after overlay. The syncytia formed by cl-2 were significantly larger than those by sp-4 ( Fig. 1A and B ). This size difference observed on BHK cells between cl-2 and sp-4 was in good agreement with the size difference in anti-S1 MAbs and anti-mouse IgG labelled with FITC for immunofluorescence plaque produced on DBT cells [30] . Interestingly, no syncytia formation was demonstrated on BHK cells with other strains or srr mutants under the phase contrast microscopy, though all of them produced syncytia on Bgp-positive DBT cells [10] . MHV-A59 induced tiny syncytia on BHK cells comprising roughly 20 to 30 cells detectable only by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1C) . Other MHV strains, MHV-1, MHV-3 and MHV-S produced tinier syncytia consisting of less than 10 cells ( Fig. 1D and E) . Srr mutants have also failed to induce syncytia comparable to those produced by wild type cl-2. Srr11 caused syncytia including about 10 to 15 cells (Fig. 1G ). Srr18 showed very tiny syncytia consisting of less than 10 cells. No obvious syncytia was observed on BHK cells overlaid with srr7-infected DBT cells. Single cells were MHV antigen-positive (Fig. 1F ). These single cells presumably represented srr7-infected DBT cells overlaid on BHK cell monolayer.",

No significant difference in the growth on BHK cells between cl-2 and other MHV strains can not be accounted for at present. The cl-2 S protein could have a very strong Bgp-independent fusion activity, but its replication in BHK cells could be less efficient than the other MHV strains. No replication of srr7 in BHK may be due to its failure to spread from infected DBT cells to BHK cells.",

We used neutralizing MAbs 3, 13 and 93 recognizing the S1N330 as well as MAbs 78 and 85 recognizing other regions in the S1 [12] . Anti-S2 antibodies with neutralizing activity were produced using rabbits. Rabbits were immunized with a synthetic peptide consisting of amino acid sequence NESPLLGCIGSTCAED which encompassed an immunodominant epitope in the S2 recognized by a neutralizing MAb 5B19.5 [14] . The rabbit sera were then affinity-purified using the synthetic peptide. BHK cell monolayer overlaid with cl-2-infected DBT cells that produced about 100 syncytia was cultured in 10-fold serial dilutions of the anti-S1 and anti-S2 antibodies. Cells were stained with Giemsa solution at 24 to 36 h after infection and the syncytium number was counted under the light microscopy. The inhibition of syncytium formation was calculated in comparison with the syncytium number formed in the absence of neutralizing antibodies. Standard neutralization test using cl-2 was also performed with these antibodies on DBT cells as described previously [30] . As shown in Fig. 3 , all of these antibodies showed fusion inhibition (FI) activity, though the FI titers were variable; anti-S1 MAbs showed 10 to 10 4 higher FI and viral neutralization activities compared with anti-S2 antibodies. The antibodies with higher neutralization titer exhibited the higher FI titer. This could imply that Fig. 2 . Growth of MHV in BHK cells after Bgp-independent infection. Ten thousands of DBT cells infected with JHMV cl-2, MHV-A59, srr7, srr11 or srr18 were overlaied on 1\u00d710 6 BHK cells or allowed to seed alone in 12-well plate. At intervals after overlay, virus titers in the cultures were measured by plaque assay the attachment of the S protein to an unidentified receptor on BHK cells, which is conceibably prevented by the anti-Si MAbs (3, 13 and 93) recognizing the receptor-binding domain on the S, is an inevitable step for the Bgp-independent fusion events or that the S1 is more profoundly involved in the Bgp-independent fusion activity than the S2. These results appear to suggest that both S1 and S2 are involved in the Bgp-independent fusion activity.",
