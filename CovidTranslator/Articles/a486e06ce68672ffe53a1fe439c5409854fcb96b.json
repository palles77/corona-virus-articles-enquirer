            "text": "Insulin-dependent (Type I) diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a metabolic disorder resulting from the lack of endogenous insulin secretion. This is due to a disease process caused by the disappearance of the insulin-producing f3 cells from the pancreatic islets of Langerhans (reviewed by Gepts and LeCompte, 1985) . Human IDDM and laboratory animal experimental diabetes mellitus are thought to be the result of both genetic and epigenetic components. The genetic component consists of at least one gene in the major histocompatability complex (MHC) that contributes to susceptibility to the disease. For the disease to develop, some epigenetictriggering event must also occur. Experimentally, this triggering event can be mimicked by either pharmacologic or infectious agents, including several viruses. The pharmacologic agents are thought to be toxic to the 8 cells, whereas the pathway of disease induction by the viral agents is unknown. Evidence has been mounting that IDDM has an autoimmune pathogenesis (reviewed by Rossini et al., 1985; Eisenbarth, 1988) .",

Class II MHC molecules have been found on pancreatic 8 cells taken from newly diagnosed patients with IDDM (Bottazzo et al., 1985; Foulis and Farquharson, 1986; Foulis et al., 1987) . While the significance of this is unknown, it has been speculated that the class II expression could cause presentation of self antigens, resulting in immune mediated destruction of the tissue. Although the cause of the aberrant class II expression is not known, it is noteworthy that the lymphokine interferon gamma (IFN-?I) can induce class II expression on a wide variety of cell types in vitro (reviewed by Rosa and Fellous, 1984) . However, it is unclear whether IFN-y alone can induce class II expression on p cells of cultured islets (Campbell et al., 1985; Campbell et al., 1986; PujoCBorrell et al., 1986a; Wright et al., 1986; Pujol-Borrell et al., 1987) . IFN-?/ is produced by the host in response to viral and bacterial infections. As opposed to the other interferons, IFN-r is apparently a product only of T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, possesses unique immunomodulatory properties, and can also affect nonlymphoid tissues.",

The IFN-y may then induce the expression of class II MHC molecules not only on normal antigen-presenting cells, but also on local epithelial cells, such as the pancreatic 8 cells.

            "text": "of Transgenic Animals In order to derive transgenic mice expressing class II MHC molecules or IFN-?/ in the pancreatic 8 cells, we constructed recombinant DNA plasmids that joined the potential controlling sequences of the human insulin gene to The plasmids consist of coding region from the AZ, A$ or IFN-Y genes fused with the 5' flanking region of the human insulin gene. The sequences from the human insulin gene include the entire first noncoding exon, followed by the first intron, and 15 bp of the second exon extending to one base before the initiator ATG codon of the insulin gene (see plnspro). In pln-sproAa, the terminator portion of the construct is contributed by the 3' untranslated region (noncoding) from the Ai gene. In the plnsproAb construct, the introcytoplasmic and 3' untranslated region are again contributed by fusion with the A; sequences. This substitution does not affect the A$ amino acid sequence since the two haplotypes are identical in this region. The plnsprolFN-y construct includes terminator sequences from the hepatitis virus B gene. the mouse class II MHC A, and Ag genes, and to the mouse IFN-y gene ( Figure 1 ). To maximize the potential for tissue-specific expression, a relatively large upstream portion (1867 bp of 5' sequences) of the human insulin gene promoter was used. It has previously been shown in transgenic mice that 660 bp of 5' sequences of the rat insulin II gene was sufficient to direct tissue-specific expression of a transgene (Hanahan, 1985) . The complete human insulin gene similarly leads to tissue-specific expression in transgenic mice (Bucchini et al., 1986; Selden et al., 1986) . The human insulin transcription start site and the complete untranslated first exon and part of the second exon of the human insulin gene were included in the construction. This promoter cassette ends immediately prior to the insulin translation start site, and was fused to the mouse genes in regions after their normal transcription start sites but before translation initiation. Since T cel,ls must recognize foreign antigen in association with self class II molecules, the class II genes used to make the fusion genes were from the same mouse strain as the zygotes used to make the transgenic mice; thus the class II genes were AZ and A$, and the zygotes were BALB/c (H-2d).",

New immunological responsiveness has been demonstrated in transgenic mice through the introduction of an I-E gene (Le Meur et al., 1985; Pinkert et al., 1985; Yamamura et al., 1985) . Activation of an autoimmune response by presentation of presumably self antigens by the 6 cells implies a failure in self recognition (tolerance). Nonresponsiveness to self antigens is thought to involve the deletion or suppression of clones of T cells that recognize self antigens. It is possible that T cell clones reactive to components of nonimmune cells are not suppressed or deleted since these molecules are not normally seen by the host immune system. Thus, in non-immune cells the expression of class II molecules may lead to the presentation of self antigens to which the host immune system is naive, resulting in the activation of an autoimmune response. Alternatively, the extreme overexpression of class II molecules in the 8 cells of these mice might lead to the bypass of tolerance by adventitious antigen presentation, since in transfected fibroblasts the level of class II expression is correlated with antigen presenting capacity (Lechler et al., 1985) .",

These cells have the capacity to present foreign antigen to T cells in vitro (Londei et al., 1984) . In addition, infiltrating T cells autoreactive to host thyroid cells have been isolated and cloned from diseased thyroid glands (Londei et al., 1985) . The diabetes in the AR/AD transgenic mice could occur as a result of analogous processes. However, the apparent paucity of inflammatory cells in the islets is curious. In human IDDM, although insulitis is thought likely to be present frequently during the initial stages of the disease, it is often not detected, perhaps because of its transient and nonuniform nature (Gepts and LeCompte, 1985) . Examination of younger, prediabetic mice, specific cell labeling studies, and electron microscopic analysis will help define the mechanism of 8 cell destruction. The few scattered inflammatory cells observed within the islets of these mice could be producing factors that are directly or indirectly toxic to 8 cells. Recent studies have suggested exquisite sensitivity of 8 cells to oxygen free radicals that are induced by lymphokines (Nomikos et al., 1986; Tsumimoto et al., 1986; Prowse et al., 1986) . The sparse amount of islet inflammation present in the current study may be sufficient to kill the 8 cells in these islets in this manner.",

If IFN-r were acting solely by inducing the expression of class II molecules, then we might expect the histology of the IFN-y transgenic diabetic mice to resemble that of the AJAB transgenic diabetic mice. As this is clearly not the case, the IFN-y must be participating in other cellular processes as well. Interferon-y is known to induce increased pancreatic class I MHC molecule expression in vitro (Campbell et al., 1985; Campbell et al., 1986; Pujol-Borrell et al., 1986a) . Increase class I MHC expression is seen in the islets of newly diagnosed diabetics (Bottazzo et al., 1985; Foulis et al., 1987) . One component of 8 cell destruction may involve cytotoxic T lymphocytes that recognize class I MHC molecules in conjunction with antigen. Additionally, because of the large inflammatory infiltrate, other lymphokines may be produced and contribute to the pathology. Leukocytes secrete tumor necrosis factor, which acts as a chemoattractant for polymorphonuclear neutrophils (Figari et al., 1987) . Interleukin-1 has been implicated in vitro as a causative factor in 8 cell damage (Bendtzen et al., 1986) , and the related proteins, tumor necrosis factor and lymphotoxin, have been shown to synergize with IFN-y in vitro to cause class II expression by 8 cells (Pujol-Borrell et al., 1987) . The IFN-y transgenic mice demonstrate the deleterious cascade of effects that are initiated by local production of IFN-y in vivo, and may therefore provide an animal model for study of virus-caused, interferon-mediated inflammation.",

To do so, identifiable genetic perturbations were made which led to diabetes.

(c)A higher magnification of a severely affected pancreas from a 6 week old mouse.Islets (arrow) are nearly totally obscured by accumulations of mononuclear inflammatory cells (X240). A few faintly staining (using peroxidase) insulin antigen positive cells were shown to be present in a duplicate section (data not shown). (d) Pancreas from an 8 week old mouse that had been maintained on exogenous insulin. Faint outlines of islets are the SV40 early region can develop antibodies directed against SV40 T antigen(Adams et al., 1987). This \"intolerance\" phenomenon does not in this case lead to diabetes. Several other exogenous genes have been expressed in the pancreatic beta cells of transgenic mice without causing IDDM: human insulin(Bucchini et al.,  1986;Selden et al., 1986), polyoma middle T antigen (V. Bautch, personal communication), and human placental lactogen (S. Alpert, personal communication).",
