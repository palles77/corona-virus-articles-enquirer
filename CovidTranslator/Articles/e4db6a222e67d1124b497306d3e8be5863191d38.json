            "text": "Gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is an important cause of blood loss anemia and a potentially life-threatening condition in dogs. 1 It is reported less frequently in cats. It may be acute or chronic, occult (no visible blood) or overt (grossly visible blood), and can vary from mild, self-limiting states to severe life-threatening conditions. Significant GI hemorrhage often can be detected during history and physical examination. However, on occasion even acute severe GI hemorrhage may be overlooked if signs localizing blood loss to the GI tract are not present or if concurrent disease obscures the diagnosis. 2, 3 In addition, because even mild cases may progress to life-threatening events, it is important to identify rapidly patients with GI hemorrhage and institute therapies to prevent their deterioration.",

It may originate in the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine. As such, a number of pathologic processes have been associated with GI hemorrhage.

Hematemesis (vomitus with the appearance of coffee grounds or frank blood), hematochezia (passage of bright red or frank blood with or without stool), or melena (black, tarry stool) suggests the GI tract as a source of hemorrhage. However, these signs are not always evident clinically and may not appear until significant GI hemorrhage has occurred. 3, 4, 11 With duodenal hemorrhage, if reflux of duodenal contents into the stomach is insufficient, blood may not be visible in the vomitus. 12 However, when it is present, hematemesis suggests ongoing blood loss. 13 Diseases of the nasal cavity and oropharynx occasionally can cause hematemesis and melena from swallowing blood of epistaxis or hemoptysis (coughing of blood). In addition, activated charcoal, metronidazole, bismuth (Pepto-Bismol), and diets high in iron (liver, unsweetened baking chocolate) can result in dark stools and should not be confused with melena. 14 A history of aspirin or other NSAID administration is not uncommon. 4, 11, 15 Case reports exist of GI ulceration, hemorrhage, and GI perforation occurring in veterinary patients that have received selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors at recommended therapeutic dosages. 11 Decrease or loss of appetite with or without other signs of GI disease should prompt consideration of GI side effects in any patients receiving NSAIDs. The medication should be discontinued and the patient should be examined. In cases of thrombocytopenia or coagulation disorders, there may be a history of bleeding from other sites of the body, including the nasal cavities or urinary tract. Thorough examination of the mucosal surfaces may reveal petechiae in severely thrombocytopenic patients. A search for subcutaneous nodules or masses may detect underlying mast cell tumors.",

Because hypoadrenocorticism has been reported as a cause of severe GI hemorrhage in the dog, electrolyte levels should be evaluated and an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test performed if another cause for GI hemorrhage cannot be found. 20 Fecal smears, cultures, and parvovirus testing may be indicated if infectious disease is suspected. Measurement of gastrin levels is recommended in cases of recurrent GI ulceration and in cases that fail to respond to medical therapy. 4 Radiographs may detect foreign bodies, masses, or free air in the peritoneal cavity. Pneumoperitoneum is suggestive of GI perforation in a patient that has not undergone recent abdominal surgery. Although contrast radiographs may identify gastrointestinal mucosal defects, they generally have been replaced by ultrasonography and endoscopy. 4, 17 Ultrasonography may identify foreign bodies and masses and may help to identify concurrent GI perforation when present. 21, 22 The use of ultrasonography to identify ulcers in dogs has been described. It allows evaluation of the intestinal wall structure and thickness and can detect the presence of a defect or crater. 22 When used serially, it may help determine changes in response to therapy and has suggested the need for surgery in some instances. 22 Ultrasonography also has been reported in the assessment of cats with GI ulceration. 3 Endoscopy is considered the most sensitive test to evaluate upper GI tract hemorrhage and ulcers, although patients must be resuscitated optimally before the procedure. 7, 17 It often provides a diagnosis, helps assess prognosis, and may have therapeutic benefits (i.e., foreign body retrieval). In addition to allowing direct visualization of the mucosa, it permits biopsies for histology and culture, which may be required to identify lesions and infectious diseases (i.e., neoplasia, inflammatory bowel disease, protothecosis). The disadvantages of endoscopy include the need for anesthesia, its limitation to the proximal GI tract and colon, the potential to exacerbate GI hemorrhage, and the possibility of causing iatrogenic ulcer perforation. 15 If the above diagnostic procedures fail to identify the cause of significant ongoing GI hemorrhage, abdominal exploratory surgery, scintigraphy using technetium-labeled red blood cells, and arteriography should be considered. 2, 17, 19 Scintigraphy has been demonstrated to aid in localization of GI hemorrhage in dogs, and arteriography may help identity GI vascular anomalies. 2,10,19",

Because of the large number of disease conditions that can result in GI hemorrhage, therapy directed toward correcting the underlying cause is variable (i.e., surgery for foreign bodies or tumors, steroids for hypoadrenocorticism, immunosuppressives for immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, discontinuation of NSAIDs). In considering the underlying cause, it is important to consider related or unrelated coagulation abnormalities (i.e., liver disease causing ulceration and a clotting factor deficiency) and to address concurrent diseases that may exacerbate GI hemorrhage (i.e., uremia in a patient on NSAIDs). however, severe acute intestinal hemorrhage can act as a cathartic, significantly decreasing GI transit time. [13] [14] [15] This may result in the passage of frank blood in the stool after significant blood loss into the upper GI tract. 13, 15 DIAGNOSTIC TESTS GI hemorrhage is confirmed when a source of bleeding is localized to the GI tract. Patients with signs of shock should have emergency minimum blood tests performed (hematocrit, total protein, blood urea nitrogen [BUN] , glucose and, if available, pH, lactate, and electrolytes) while resuscitative efforts and a search for the underlying cause are undertaken. In cases suspected to have hemoabdomen or septic peritonitis, abdominocentesis, emergency abdominal sonography, and possibly diagnostic peritoneal lavage are warranted and may be performed during initial resuscitation of the patient. Once resuscitative efforts have commenced or the patient's condition has stabilized, other diagnostic modalities should be considered.",

The finding of microcytic, hypochromic anemia (iron deficiency anemia) is reported with chronic GI hemorrhage. 4 However, because iron deficiency anemia takes time to develop, normocytic normochromic anemia is more common in cases of recent GI hemorrhage. 1, 4 A high BUN-to-creatinine ratio (greater than 20) has been reported with GI hemorrhage. 16 This phenomenon has been explained by volume depletion and intestinal absorption of proteins, including digested blood, into the circulatory system. 16 However, diseases resulting in increased protein metabolism (fever, burns, infections, starvation, and administration of glucocorticoids) also may result in an increased BUN-to-creatinine ratio. 1, 16 Large bowel hemorrhage reportedly has little effect on BUN levels, and many dogs with GI hemorrhage do not have an elevation in the BUN concentration. 1, 16, 17 In equivocal cases of GI hemorrhage a fecal occult blood test (most of which rely on the peroxidase activity of hemoglobin) may be performed. Although helpful for detecting occult GI hemorrhage, diets containing red meat or having high peroxidase activity, such as fish, fruits, or vegetables, can cause false-positive results. 18 Animals should be fed a meat-free diet for at least 72 hours before a fecal occult blood test. 19 The presence of peroxidase-producing bacteria within the GI tract also may cause false-positive results. 18 Despite false-positive results a negative fecal occult blood test result does rule out significant GI hemorrhage. 2 When significant gastric hemorrhage is suspected, passage of a nasogastric tube and aspiration of the stomach contents may confirm and help localize the site of GI hemorrhage. However, this procedure may cause discomfort, and falsenegative results have been reported. 12, 17 ",

Broad-spectrum antibiotics also are recommended in patients that are septic. Ideally, samples for culture and susceptibility (i.e., urine and blood) should be collected before starting antibiotic therapy. In cases in which GI mucosal barrier compromise is not believed to be a factor (i.e., idiopathic immune mediated thrombocytopenia) and there is no evidence of sepsis, supportive therapy and addressing the underlying cause supersedes the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. A recent study evaluating the efficacy of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in dogs with aseptic idiopathic acute hemorrhagic gastroenteritis found no difference in morbidity or mortality in patients treated with antibiotics compared with those given a placebo. 27",

An equally efficacious alternative to surgery with lower morbidity in human studies is percutaneous angiography and embolization, which may be applicable to veterinary patients. 30, 31 ",

There are no veterinary studies to conclude which gastroprotectants or combination of gastroprotectants is most efficacious in the management of GI ulcers. However, a study demonstrated that famotidine (0.5 mg/kg IV q12h), omeprazole (1 mg/ kg PO q24h), and pantoprazole (1 mg/kg IV q24h) significantly suppressed gastric acid secretion in dogs, but ranitidine (2 mg/kg IV q24h) failed to show significant gastric acid suppression at the dosage evaluated. 26 In cases of NSAID toxicity, misoprostol may provide additional benefit (see Chapters 76 and 161).",
