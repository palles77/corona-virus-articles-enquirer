In a systematic review of the literature on nine respiratory viral infections of public-health importance, we identifi ed 436 articles with statements of incubation period and 38 with data for pooled analysis. We fi tted a log-normal distribution to pooled data and found the median incubation period to be 5\u00b76 days (95% CI 4\u00b78-6\u00b73) for adenovirus, 3\u00b72 days (95% CI 2\u00b78-3\u00b77) for human coronavirus, 4\u00b70 days (95% CI 3\u00b76-4\u00b74) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 1\u00b74 days (95% CI 1\u00b73-1\u00b75) for infl uenza A, 0\u00b76 days (95% CI 0\u00b75-0\u00b76) for infl uenza B, 12\u00b75 days (95% CI 11\u00b78-13\u00b73) for measles, 2\u00b76 days (95% CI 2\u00b71-3\u00b71) for parainfl uenza, 4\u00b74 days (95% CI 3\u00b79-4\u00b79) for respiratory syncytial virus, and 1\u00b79 days (95% CI 1\u00b74-2\u00b74) for rhinovirus. When using the incubation period, it is important to consider its full distribution: the right tail for quarantine policy, the central regions for likely times and sources of infection, and the full distribution for models used in pandemic planning. Our estimates combine published data to give the detail necessary for these and other applications.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory viruses cause substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. 1 Lower respiratory-tract infections are the leading cause of communicable disease death and among the top fi ve contributors to disability-adjusted life years. 2 Viruses are the primary cause of lower respiratory-tract infections in children and a substantial cause of such infections in all age-groups. 3, 4 The incubation period of an infectious disease is the time between infection and symptom onset. 5 This period is widely reported because it is useful in infectious disease surveillance and control, in which the time of symptom onset may be the only indication of the time of infection. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) off ers a dramatic example: by rapidly determining the maximum incubation period of SARS, public-health offi cials were able to set quarantine periods and halt a potential pandemic without the aid of a vaccine or treatment. [6] [7] [8] [9] The incubation period thus plays an essential part in surveillance for healthcare-associated infections, 10, 11 and may aid in diagnosis if laboratory facilities are unavailable. The incubation period is clinically relevant in the administration of antiviral medications, many of which are most eff ective when given before or immediately after symptom onset. 12 Epidemiological studies depend on the incubation period to identify potential sources of infection. 13 Predictive models designed to inform policy decisions use the incubation period to evaluate the potential of surveillance programmes and interventions to confront emerging epidemics. 14, 15 The length of the incubation period by comparison with the latent period (the time between infection and becoming infectious) determines the potential eff ectiveness of control measures that target symptomatic individuals. 16 Statements of the incubation period are often imprecise, unsourced, or based on limited evidence-for example, \"4-5 days\" may refer to the most common range, the highest and lowest incubation periods in a study, or some other interval. Without knowing which summary measure is being stated, it is hard to use this information to make clinical or infection control decisions. Estimates given without attribution or based on few observations do not meet the standards of evidence we demand for modern medical information.",

The distinctive clinical presentation of measles allowed observations of the incubation period as early as 1847. 49 Most estimates for measles are consistent with an incubation period of 8-14 days (table 1). Some of the variability in estimates stems from the use of two clinical defi nitions of symptom onset: the appearance of rash and the fi rst symptoms of illness. We have excluded those studies that reported just the time to rash, as our interest was the time until fi rst symptoms. However, not all the reports stated the specifi c symptom used by the authors to mark the end of the incubation period. Based on 55 observations from eight observational studies, [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] we estimate the median incubation period of measles to be 12\u00b75 days (95% CI 11\u00b78-13\u00b72), and the dispersion to be 1\u00b723 (95% CI 1\u00b718-1\u00b728). 5% of measles cases will develop symptoms before 8\u00b79 days (95% CI 8\u00b71-9\u00b78), and 95% by 17\u00b77 days (95% CI 16\u00b71-19\u00b72) after infection.",

Symptoms include rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, headache, sore throat, and cough. 4 Complications include sinusitis, otitis media, and exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 3 We found 15 articles on the incubation period of rhinovirus. There were twice as many original (eight) as sourced (four) or unsourced (four) estimates. Low estimates of the incubation period are less than half a day. 3, 80, 81 Many experimental studies of rhinovirus infection report the time to peak mean symptom score of participants as a measure of the incubation period. 82, 83 This method may bias estimates of the incubation period to be longer, because the time of most severe symptoms will usually follow the time of fi rst symptoms. Most estimates are consistent with an incubation period of 2-4 days (table 1) .",

The time of exposure bounds the time of infection, but is rarely available. Observational studies may not include all infected cases, thus the methods by which cases are identifi ed are themselves a potential source of bias. Experimental infection and natural experiments (eg, aeroplane infections) 42 may diff er from normal exposure in ways that aff ect the incubation period. Routes of administration, changes in infectious dose, or diff ering periods of exposure to infectious individuals may modify the time to symptom onset. Most experimental studies use healthy adult volunteers, yet severe disease is concentrated in children and the elderly. Variation between studies in the defi nition of symptom onset and inclusion criteria may thus aff ect our estimates. Precise guidelines on the start of the symptomatic period for each disease would remove some of this variation.",

For some diseases (adenovirus, human coronavirus, infl uenza B, parainfl uenza, and rhinovirus) estimates are still based on one or two studies and fewer than 100 observations. This necessarily leaves uncertainty in our results, and perhaps bias if these studies were atypical. We found eight instances (excluding SARS, for which there is ample evidence) in which a study that might contain data on the incubation period was done but the information necessary to estimate the incubation period was not published. These studies were mostly done over 30 years ago, and we felt it unlikely that the original data could be easily obtained. A motivated researcher who could obtain this or other unpublished data would add much to our results. More data is clearly needed if we are to understand how factors such as virus morphology, host status, climate, and infectious dose infl uence the incubation period.",

Our comprehensive systematic review pools published data to characterise the entire incubation period distribution including the left and right tails, which makes the incubation period more useful in research, clinical practice, and public-health policy.",

SARS-associated coronavirus diff ers clinically from other coronaviruses, causing a biphasic illness. In the fi rst phase, myalgia, cough, dyspnoea, fever with diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal symptoms are common. In the second phase, patients develop respiratory distress syndrome, sometimes requiring ventilation and intensive care.12 of the fi rst 10 cases of SARS detected in Canada",

All became symptomatic 12-84 h after exposure (median 38 h). In a highly cited 1998 paper, Cox and Fukuda 73 summarised these results, codifying the estimate as 1-4 days, with which most estimates for infl uenza are consistent(table 1). Many original studies of infl uenza's incubation period remain uncited. Several pre-1918 reports, a series of papers on the 1918 pandemic, and a fl urry of experimental studies published in the 1930s and 1940s after discovery of the virus remain underused.We extracted 85 observations of the incubation period of infl uenza A from six experimental studies,[37][38][39][40][41]43 78 observations of the incubation period of infl uenza B from two experimental studies,41,44 and 66 observations of the incubation period of infl uenza A or an unknown",
