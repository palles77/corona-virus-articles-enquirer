Successive COSY correlations between H-1 0 and H-5 0 confirmed that the four oxygenated methines and the oxygenated methylene of compound 1 were linked to form a furanose moiety. The relative stereochemistry of the pentofuranose was deduced from 1 H-1H NOESY correlations and 1 H-1H coupling constants. [12] [13] [14] [15] Furthermore, a NOESY crosspeak between H-1 0 and H-4 0 indicated that both protons were on the same face of the ring. The sugar moiety was deduced to be b-D-ribose, as proven by the coupling constants (H-1 0 , H-2 0 , and H-3 0 ) and the comparable specific rotation value of the compound 1/2 mixture \u00f0\u00bda 21 D \u00c0 58\u00de, which matches those reported for modified ribose units. 15 The unusual 1 H and 13 C NMR chemical shifts of CH 3 -7 and CH 2 -5 were indicative of a sulfoxide group in compound 1, and the HMBC correlation between the methyl protons (H-7) and C-5 0 indicated a methylsulfinylfuranose moiety. 15, 16 The chemical shifts for the anomeric proton and carbon signals (d H 6.16; d C 90.2) were consistent with the presence of a C-N glycosidic linkage. HMBC correlations between H-1 and C-4 and C-8 confirmed connection between the furanose unit and the adenine moiety at the expected N-9 position. Further 1 H NMR analyses and correlations observed in the HMBC spectrum of the mixture indicated the presence of the 6-bromo-5-hydroxy-3-carboxylindolyl moiety, which was previously recognized as a part of the structure of herdmanine E from the same tunicate. 4 The correlation between H-3 0 and C-8 00 suggested that these two moieties were joined by an ester linkage (Fig. 1) . Based on the above, compound 1 was characterized as (2S,3S,4R,5R)-5-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)-4-hydroxy-2-[(methylsulfinyl)methyl]tetrahydrofuran-3-yl-(6-bromo-5-hydroxy-1Hindole)-3-carboxylate and given the trivial name momusine A.",

Consequently, compounds 1, 3 and 2, 4 were deduced to be two pairs of epimers ( Fig. 2A) , and this was confirmed by oxidizing the sulfinyl group in mixtures with H 2 O 2 and subsequent HPLC analysis. 23 The mixtures of 1/2 (Fig. 2B) and of 3/4 (Fig. 2C) were converted to sulfonyladenosine derivatives, and each mixture yielded identical two-component (5 and 6) mixtures ( Fig. 2D and E, respectively) . This finding indicated that compounds 1, 3 and 2, 4 are epimeric at the sulfoxide group. 5 0 -Deoxy-5 0 -methylsulfinyladenosine epimers have been isolated from Ganoderma lucidum, 16 and reported in onion extracts. 24, 25 Distinct biological activities have also been described for epimers differentiated by sulfoxide-asymmetry. 24, 25 Usually the sulfoxide configuration of natural products is (S). 26 In the present study, we tried to determine the absolute stereochem-istry of the sulfoxide moiety in compounds 1-4 by using MsrA (methionine sulfoxide reductase A, Protein Data Bank code: 1NWA), which selectively reduces S-configured sulfoxides. 27 However, neither mixture 1/2 nor mixture 3/4 was reduced by MrsA, 28 suggesting that these new nucleosides are not good substrates for MsrA and cannot bind properly to the active enzyme site. Rare sponge-derived nucleosides, such as, spongothymidine and spongouridine served as antiviral leads and culminated in antiviral drugs like acyclovir and zanamivir. In some antiviral 5 0 -deoxyribonucleosides, substitution of a methylsulfonyl group at the 5 0 -position increased antiviral activity while securing low cytotoxicity. 29 Moreover, 5-hydroxy-6-bromoindole-3-carboxylic acid derivatives display antiviral activities against a number of viruses including influenza A/B/C viruses, avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus, Marek's disease virus, and hepatitis B/C viruses.

Considering the chemical structure of those nucleoside derivatives, compounds 1-4 may exhibit antibacterial, analgesic, sedative, and cardiac depressant activities, 15 however, further biological evaluations could not be performed due to paucity of materials. eluent to afford four components (1-4).
