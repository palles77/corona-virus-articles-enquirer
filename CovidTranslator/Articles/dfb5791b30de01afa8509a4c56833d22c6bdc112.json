In the review by Han et al. [4] , a novel receptor-like kinase subfamily in angiosperm, CrRLK1-L subfamily, was described in detail. After discussing the structure, enzymological properties and biological function of CrRLK1-L, the authors argued that CrRLK1-L could initiate signal transduction largely independent of the known signaling pathways. However, a better understanding of its allosteric regulation and substrate specificity are still necessary for defining the pathways that it may modulate. Unlike CrRLK1-L, calcineurin is an extensively studied serine-threonine protein phosphatase because it plays a pivotal role in a wide series of crucial physiological processes. Tu et al. [5] reviewed the recent literature on a new family of calcineurin regulators (RCANs), and discussed the molecular mechanism for RCAN-mediated regulation of calcineurin. After exemplifying the roles of RCANs in a wide variety of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, the authors suggested that RCANs are potential targets for drug development. Similar to RCANs, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is also involved in Alzheimer's disease, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Recently, a research article by Ding et al. [6] provided a clue to this question. In their article, one member of SR protein family, 9G8, was identified as a new substrate protein of GSK-3. Hence, the authors suggested that GSK-3 could inhibit 9G8-mediated alternative splicing of tau exon 10 by phosphorylating 9G8, consequently inhibiting the aggregation of tau exon 10.",

By attachment of ubiquitin to the protein as a monomer or as polyubiquitin chains with different ubiquitin-ubiquitin linkages, the function and fate of the modified substrate can be drastically changed. Ubiquitination is a reversible process regulated by a subtle balance of ubiquitin-modifying enzymes and deubiquitinating enzymes. Two reviews and one research article were recently published, both the review by Xie et al. [7] and the research article by Sun et al. [8] focused on the deubiquitinating enzymes. Xie et al. provided an overview of the recent advances in structural and functional studies of ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), with a special emphasis on the protective effects of UCH-L1 on neurons. Sun and coworkers focused on nsp3, a newly-identified deubiquitinase from human coronavirus NL63. Nsp3 has two papain-like protease (PLP) core domains, and has both protease and deubiquitinase activities. By in vitro and in vivo methods, the authors demonstrated that the deubiquitinase site was located in the second PLP domain and shared two catalytic residues with the protease site. Furthermore, the authors found the deubiquitinase activity of Nsp3 could induce the deubiquitination of RIG-I and ERIS and then regulate antiviral innate immune responses by inhibition of both RIG-I and TLR3-dependent induction of interferon. Although ubiquitination in eukaryotic systems has been studied for decades, the prokaryotic analog of ubiquitin, ubiquitin-like protein (Pup) was not identified until 2008. Wang et al. [9] reviewed the latest advances in research of the Pup-proteasome system and comprehensively discussed its catalytic and regulatory mechanism. The authors suggested that the Pup-proteasome system could be regarded as a potential therapeutic target because of its extensive involvement in many important physiological pathways of pathogenic bacteria.",

            "text": "Acetylation and methylation of histones play fundamental roles in gene expression following environmental stimuli. While acetylation of histones converts chromatin from a closed to an open conformation that facilitates transcription, histone methylation can keep chromatin in either an activated or a repressed state, depending on the precise methylation site and the degree of modification. Interestingly, the intense cross-talk between histone modifications drives distinct downstream functions. Two recent reviews summarize the latest advances of research into two histone modifying enzymes. In the review by Guo [10] , the structure and function of a new histone trimethylase, PRDM9 (PR domain containing 9) are described. PRDM9 catalyzes the H3K4 trimethylation, and possesses the activity of a transcription factor and presumably plays an important role in the initiation of recombination. This review strengthens our understanding of species evolution and genetic recombination. Peng et al. [11] introduced the latest advances of research into sirtuin proteins. Sirtuins are a highly conserved family of NAD + -dependent deacetylase enzymes and are involved in many important biological processes, including cellular stress resistance, genomic stability, tumorigenesis and energy metabolism. In this review, the authors emphasized the structure and catalytic mechanism of sirtuins and discussed the relationship between sirtuins and aging.",

Therefore, enzymes involved in proteolysis are regarded as key nodes in the living system, and have received increasing attention over the past decade. In eukaryotic cells, proteasome-dependent degradation is the general mode of selective protein degradation. While the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation pathway has been well studied, little attention has been directed toward the possible involvement of the proteasome in ubiquitin-independent proteolysis. However, increasing evidence shows that the ubiquitin-independent proteasomal proteolysis pathway is involved in the elimination of some short-lived regulated proteins, misfolded proteins, aged proteins and oxidized proteins as well as providing \"quality control\" of newly synthesized proteins. Thus, it plays important roles in pathological processes such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent progress in understanding ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation and the underlying molecular mechanisms were discussed by Chen et al. [13] . Besides the proteasome, proteases also catalyze protein proteolysis. In a review by Wu et al. [14] , a newlyidentified protease, TMPRSS6, was described. TMPRSS6 is a transmembrane serine protease which can regulate the expression of hepcidin, thereby affecting iron metabolism. In this review, the authors discussed the relationship between the structure and function of TMPRSS6, and the roles of TMPRSS6 in iron metabolism-related diseases.",

            "text": "Because proteases are involved in many diseases [15] , protease inhibitors have been of great interest for the development of novel therapies. In a recent research article, Tian and coworkers [16] investigated the protease inhibitory activity and antineoplastic effect of buckwheat trypsin inhibitor (BTI). The authors not only identified the active site of BTI, but also obtained two BTI mutants which showed much better stability to heat and pH than wild-type BTI. Their results will contribute to clarifying the physiological mechanism of BTI and support the development of novel anticancer drugs. Many biologists are now using \"omics\" tools to investigate organisms and construct various interaction networks. However, because biological systems are essentially built of highly coordinated sets of interaction networks across different scales, integration of the networks from the various 'omics' tools is a core paradigm for deep comprehension and ultimately reconstruction of these living systems. While PTM enzymes act as key nodes in protein-protein interaction networks as discussed above, the enzymes whose substrates are something other than proteins, can bridge protein networks and other networks together. Therefore, the enzymes acting on non-protein substrates are of increasing interest in the systems biology era. Glutamate synthase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) are three important metabolism enzymes, and play key roles in metabolomics and proteomics data integration. Although these enzymes had been extensively studied, the results presented in three recently published articles indicate that their biological functions are still to be clarified. In an article by Lu et al. [17] , the authors investigated the roles of glutamate synthase in carbon and nitrogen metabolism of rice, and concluded that glutamate synthase was indispensable for efficient nitrogen assimilation in rice. Meanwhile, new physiological functions of DHFR and LDH were discussed. While Sun and coworkers [18] found DHFR was essential for the development of pharyngeal arches, Li and coworkers [19] suggested that the reduction or loss of LDH-C4 activity in sperm might cause male infertility. These results indicate that our knowledge of \"old\" enzymes is not complete. Based on the accumulated experiment data on metabolism enzymes, a general relationship between genomics, proteomics and metabolomics of microbes was discussed recently [20, 21] .",

In two recent research articles, the inhibitory mechanisms of helicase and integrase were discussed. Luo and coworkers [24] extensively investigated the effect of lomefloxacin on bloom syndrome helicase (BLM). BLM is an important member of the RecQ family of DNA helicases and plays important roles in DNA repair, recombination, transcription and telomere maintenance. The authors found that lomefloxacin could promote the binding of BLM to DNA, but would unexpectedly inhibit the helicase and ATPase activities of BLM. Subsequently, the authors proposed a possible mechanism based on their kinetics and thermodynamics results which should prove useful for the design of inhibitors against DNA helicase and improve our understanding of the mechanism of action of quinolone drugs. While Luo et al. used in vitro methods to study BLM, Hu and coworkers [25] investigated the inhibitory mechanism of compound L708, 906 towards HIV-1 integrase by using in silico methods. They found the binding of L708, 906 to HIV-1 integrase could alter the mobility of the protein, and thereby result in the decrease of integrase activity. Their results should be helpful for anti-HIV drug design. However, in silico results ultimately have to be supported by \"real\" experimental data. High-throughput screening assays with adequate sensitivity, reproducibility, and accuracy have been indispensable for the discovery of drugs targeting HIV-1 integrase. In a recent research article, He and coworkers [26] developed a novel method for measuring the disintegration activity of HIV-1 integrase. This method is rapid, sensitive and, most importantly, readily adapted to a high-throughput format, and hence is likely to be applicable to antiviral drug screening.",

One strategy is to create an animation to display the dynamic change of biological networks using a series of snapshots of the biological networks captured by high-throughput methods at different points in time. However, because of technical limitations, it is impossible to capture the snapshots at a rate faster than the biochemical reactions, indicating that the \"dynamic change of networks\" provided by this strategy is actually discontinuous in time, and the biochemical events occurring between any two adjacent snapshots are missed. A better strategy is to incorporate biochemical reaction parameters into biological networks, by which biologists can construct the dynamic biological networks with more \"living\" properties.

In addition, while canonical kinetic methods provide only ensemble-averaged molecular information, the conformational heterogeneity of an enzyme cannot be ignored in living cells because of the low abundance of enzymes, macromolecular crowding and confinement. Therefore, characterization of enzymes in the context of a biological system is the prerequisite for understanding its dynamic properties. Fortunately, thanks to the close collaboration of scientists and engineers from various disciplines, many novel techniques have recently been developed and applied to the investigation of the in vivo behavior of enzymes. For example, mass spectrometry based enzymatic assay techniques have been applied to inhibitor screening in vivo, identification of endogenous substrates, and in vivo enzymatic activities of orphan proteins [33] . Light and fluorescence microscopy techniques are being used in measuring enzyme activity in single cells in a real-time manner [34, 35] . In particular, the development of single molecule detection techniques has made it possible to characterize enzyme catalysis at the single molecule level [36\uf02d39] . Mathematical modeling and model-based data analysis are indispensable for understanding the behavior of biological systems [40, 41] . Xu and coworkers [42] proposed a generic rate equation for the dynamical modeling of metabolic kinetics, in which kinetic parameters are clear and precise enough to correlate to experimental data for purposes of constructing a database.

Zhang and coworkers [48] investigated the effect of substrate-induced conformation changes on enzyme catalysis, and found that the activity and conformation of an enzyme is changed when the enzyme induced with one substrate was reacted with other substrates in subsequent reactions.

            "text": "The identification and isolation of novel enzymes is an extremely active field in enzymology. There are two general experimental strategies for enzyme discovery, which are based on function (activity) or sequence, respectively. The function-based strategy is a straightforward way to obtain enzymes which have desired functions. For example, using molecular probes that bind to enzymes of interest in an activity-dependent manner, enzymologists not only can quantify the dynamics of an enzyme in vivo, but also can directly isolate and identify the enzyme with the desired function from cell or tissue samples [51] . This technique, termed activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), is being widely applied to the discovery of novel enzymes and drugs [52, 53] . Compared with the function-based strategy, the sequencebased strategy is readily performed using bioinformatics and PCR approaches, and is widely used in many laboratories. Using the sequence-based strategy, Sun and Liu [54] successfully isolated a new carboxylesterase gene from Geobacillus stearothermophilus. Because of the fact that the enzyme exhibited a high thermal stability and broad pH tolerance, the authors suggested that this carboxylesterase had potential applications in the synthesis of stereospecific compounds and degradation of environmental contaminants. Although these two experimental strategies have been very successful in enzyme discovery, biological experimentation alone is clearly inadequate to meet the challenge presented by the exponentially increasing number of unknown sequences. To address this challenge, a large-scale collaborative project, the Enzyme Function Initiative (EFI), was established in 2010. The EFI is developing a computation-based multidisciplinary strategy for functional assignment of unknown enzymes in a high throughput manner [55] .",

For example, early studies showed that the (R)-oxynitrilase from Prunus salicina was one of the poorest oxynitrilases for the synthesis of (R)-cyanohydrins from hydrogen cyanide with aldehydes, and thereby not suitable for industrial applications. However, in a recent research article, Liu and Zong [56] reported that plum (R)-oxynitrilase could efficiently catalyze enantioselective transcyanation of acetyltrimethylsilane with acetone cyanohydrin, and both acetyltrimethylsilane conversion and enantiomeric excess of the product were above 99%. This finding implies that identifying new catalytic functions of known enzymes is an efficient way to increase the potential applications of enzymes in biotechnology. Although enzymes are usually regarded as specific catalysts of biochemical reactions, the promiscuity of some enzymes is a common phenomenon, and the structural, mechanistic, and evolutionary implications of this were discussed in a recent review [57] . Considering the fact that industrial reaction conditions are different from physiological conditions, the secondary capabilities of some enzymes may make them more suitable for industrial applications in certain cases.",

However, natural enzymes are usually not optimally suited for industrial applications because they have evolved to work in the mild cellular environment rather than under harsh process conditions. Fortunately, many strategies have been developed to overcome this problem, the most popular ones of which are directed evolution, rational design, chemical modification and immobilization. Using these approaches, many biocatalysts with excellent properties were developed and used in various applications. For example, Wu and coworkers [58] developed a novel capillary trypsin reactor by organic-inorganic hybrid monolith based immobilization. This trypsin reactor not only has high enzymatic activity, but also shows reliable mechanical stability and permeability. This reactor is promising for the development of an automated online digestion device for use in proteomics. The recent advances, new challenges and future trends of directed evolution, rational design, chemical modification and immobilization are comprehensively discussed in a number of reviews [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] .",

            "text": "One of the major technological hurdles in enzymology research is how to control the expression of the enzyme of interest at the desired level. Although many biologists hope to maximize the expression yield, some enzymologists who engage in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology are facing a greater challenge: how to optimize the absolute and relative levels of the enzyme components of the designed biosynthetic pathway, and how to balance the activities of endogenous and exogenous enzymes. For example, to make a Taxol precursor in Escherichia coli, the expression level of more than 30 endogenous and exogenous enzymes were optimized [64] . Therefore, the development of novel expression strategies has an important impact on enzymological research. Two recent research articles introduced two new enzyme expression strategies. A functional fragment of coagulation factor VIII (BDD-FVIII) has potential for use in the therapy of hemophilia A. However, because of its large size, it is difficult to deliver the BDD-FVIII gene into cells by a single adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector, slowing the development of gene therapy for hemophilia A. Zhu and coworkers [65] presented a protein trans-splicing based dual-vector delivery system which is suitable for the expression of larger proteins in mammalian cells. Using this delivery system, BDD-FVIII was successfully expressed in HEK-293 and COS-7 cells. These results not only pave the way for the development of gene therapy for hemophilia A, but also offer a new strategy for the expression of large for-eign proteins. Wang et al. [66] inserted H. polymorphaderived ribosomal DNA (rDNA)-targeting element into a pPIC9K-derived expression vector containing the pGAP promoter, and developed a high-efficiency H. polymorpha expression system, by which the yield of recombinant T4 lysozyme was up to 0.5 g L \uf02d1 . Besides describing a highefficiency expression system for production of heterologous protein, their results also provide a strategy for the construction of a high-efficiency expression system.",

For example, cellulosome is a multi-enzyme complex from anaerobic microorganisms which consists of a large number of enzymatic components arranged around non-enzymatic scaffolding proteins. Because of its potential biotechnological applications in the conversion of intractable cellulosic biomass into sugars, cellulosome is of wide interest in enzymology and biotechnology. In a recent review, Wang et al. [69] summarized the latest advances and future challenges in the reconstitution of cellulosome.
