The major advantage of the static mode is that a cantilever is not affected by damping because the bending motion caused by the analyte-induced surface stress is slow enough, minimizing the damping in most cases. Since the damping of liquid media severely decreases the sensitivity in the dynamic mode, the static mode is a better option for measurements in a liquid environment. It does not require any complicated peripheral devices, such as actuators or high-frequency readout setups, which are usually necessary for dynamic mode measurements. however, there are several issues to be addressed in static mode operation. The longstanding issue is the difficulties in interpreting obtained signals. At present, there is no well-accepted consensus on the origin of surface stress. Although it is roughly regarded as a result of an increase in electrostatic or steric interactions between the adsorbed analytes on the surface of a cantilever, a comprehensive model is still missing. even for a model system of alkanethiols on a gold (111) surface, several explanations have been reported so far. Thus, the proper calibration should be performed for each application before the actual measurements.",

This shift is due to the change in effective mass induced by the adsorption of analytes on a cantilever. Since signals can be directly correlated to the basic property of adsorbates, that is, mass, the dynamic mode is a useful and powerful technique to derive quantitative information. As the sensitivity generally depends on the resonance frequency determined by the size of a cantilever, a nanometer scale cantilever operated at very high frequency bands (\u223c30\u223c300 mhz) marked several milestones, such as \u223c7 zeptogram (10 -21 g) resolution (equivalent to \u223c30 xenon atoms) in a cryogenically cooled, ultrahigh vacuum (below 10 -10 torr) apparatus [15] , and the mass resolution less than 1 attogram (10 -18 g) in air at room temperature [16] . It is important to note that the bending of a cantilever is caused by the adsorbate-induced surface stress in the case of static mode (the gravity effect is almost negligible). Reproduced from Ref.

This equation is derived through pure mechanics, assuming the ideal condition. Thus, in practical situations, several issues still remain. one of the most important issues is the damping effect induced by the surrounding media, as briefly described in the previous section. The damping severely lowers the performance of a cantilever sensor in terms of a low quality factor Q, especially in a liquid environment where Q becomes one-tenth of that in air, resulting in low resolution to track the resonance frequency. Braun and Ghatkesar et al. proposed and demonstrated an elegant way to circumvent the damping effect in a liquid environment using higher flexural modes [17] [18] [19] . They succeeded in detecting protein-ligand interactions in a physiological environment at a sensitivity of 2.5 pg/hz [17] , and demonstrated the significant improvement in quality factor of up to \u223c30 times with the 16th flexural mode [19] . other factors affecting the signals in the dynamic mode are adsorption-induced effects, such as surface stress and position dependence, which can either stiffen or soften the cantilever, thereby varying the spring constant. The relationship between the surface stress and stiffness of a cantilever has been intensively discussed [20] [21] [22] . lee et al. visually demonstrated the dependence of resonance frequency on a pattern of a gold layer on the surface of a cantilever [23] . In any case, we have to be careful about these effects when we analyze the signals obtained with the dynamic mode.",

The laser is reflected on the surface of a cantilever and then the position is measured by a position-sensitive detector (PSD) (Fig. 4.3 .2). It gives high sensitivity in terms of signalto-noise ratio because of its relatively low noise. Another practical advantage of this method is that there is no requirement for wiring on a cantilever array sensor chip because both the source and detector of laser light are placed at remote positions. however, optical readout has several drawbacks when we consider actual applications. First of all, laser-related peripherals are bulky and expensive in most cases. For multiple cantilevers such as a cantilever array, the same number of laser sources must be prepared. While highly integrated VcSel or multiple optical fiber systems might be able to solve this problem, each laser light should be always aligned on each cantilever precisely. Thus, optical readout is not suitable for large one-or two-dimensional arrays. Another critical problem is the difficulty in measurements in opaque liquids, such as blood. In such a liquid, the optical signal is significantly attenuated owing to low transmission or refractive index change.",

In contrast to the optical readout method, no bulky and complex peripherals are required because a piezoresistive readout electrically measures the change in resistance of a piezoresistor with a simple circuit ( Fig. 4. 3.4). By means of the piezoresistive readout, it is also possible to perform measurements even in It is important to cover the piezoresistor with a passivation layer, such as silicon nitride, to prevent leakage of current, especially in the case of measurements in a liquid environment.

In addition, because of its complementary metal-oxide semiconductor compatibility, the whole sensor unit including readout parts can be integrated into common semiconductor devices, such as mobile phones. It is also technically feasible by mass production to produce inexpensive disposal chips, which are important for various applications, especially for medical diagnosis. Thus, the piezoresistive readout has been regarded as one of the most promising approaches to overcome the problems arising from the optical readout. In spite of these inherent advantages, piezoresistive cantilevers have not been widely utilized for sensing applications because of their critically low sensitivity. In other words, they will open the door to the applications of nanomechanical sensors if the sensitivity of a piezoresistive cantilever can be significantly improved. Therefore, various trials have been made for more than a decade to improve the sensitivity of a piezoresistive cantilever toward practical uses. however, significant improvement in sensitivity has not been achieved to make piezoresistive detection comparable to the optical approach.",

The surface stress simulation was conducted for both the cantilever-based sensor and mSS. The surface stress of 0.2 N/m was nonuniformly applied to the sensors with the standard deviation of 5, 10, and 20%. one hundred cases were simulated for each sensor. Figure 4 .3.6 shows the distribution of the output signals. In the case of the cantilever-based sensor, the distribution of the output signals had almost the same standard deviations as the surface stress. on the other hand, the standard deviations of the output signals dramatically decreased for the mSS; approximately 50 times smaller than the standard deviations of the surface stress. These results indicate that the mSS has a higher stability for the inhomogeneous surface stress compared to a cantilever-based sensor. As the inhomogeneous surface stress is mainly caused by the roughness of the receptor layers, these results suggest that the mSS is less influenced by the quality of the coatings, leading to the higher uniformity of the sensing performance. The results of the FeA simulations were also confirmed experimentally (Fig. 4.3.7) . on the basis of the FeA simulation and the experimental results, the higher reproducibility of the mSS compared to a cantileverbased sensor was demonstrated; the output signal of the mSS is less influenced by the roughness of the receptor layer. This enhanced sensor-to-sensor repeatability leads not only to accurate and reliable data acquisition in research, but also to the mass production of nanomechanical sensors.",

Drop casting and dipcoating are examples of fast and convenient coating methods. These methods, however, lead to coatings on both sides. In the case of a cantilever-based sensor with the optical (laser) readout method, the double-side coating does not work because the cantilever does not have measurable vertical deformation as shown in Fig. 4 .3.8b. In contrast to the optical readout case, signals are obtained with a double-side-coated piezoresistive cantilever sensor [35, 36] . An in-plane elongation caused by the surface stresses on both sides can be detected by the piezoresistor embedded at the clamped end (Fig. 4.3.8d) . however, only a local stress induced at the surface where the piezoresistor is embedded can be detected, leading to low sensitivity. Taking account of the conventional cantilever-type geometry and the material property of silicon, it is difficult to realize high sensitivity with the double-side coating.",

Nanomechanical sensors have a distinct advantage over measuring the mechanical properties of cellular systems as the principle of nanomechanical sensors is based on the detection of strain/stress and the resultant deflection. maloney et al. reported the monitoring of single Aspergillus niger spore growth by means of functionalized cantilevers [91] . They detected the growth of single spores as changes in resonant frequency. It has been reported by Bischofs et al. that cell migration causes surface tension of \u223c2 mN/m, which is larger than the detection limit of the nanomechanical sensors with high sensitivity, such as optical readout cantilevers (typically 0.15-0.90 mN/m) and mSS (<0.1 mN/m) [3] . Thus, nanomechanical sensors would provide new grounds for exploring the mechanical properties of living cells. ",

Then, we reviewed a recently developed nanomechanical sensing platform; mSS, which has various practical advantages over conventional nanomechanical sensors. The analytical approach to designing a receptor layer with optimized sensitivity was explained. Since they can detect volume and/ or mass of analytes, nanomechanical sensors are promising devices for the measurements of diverse biomaterials, ranging from small molecules (e.g., volatile organic compounds, amino acid) to microorganisms (e.g., viruses, cells) as summarized in this chapter. In addition, application of nanomechanical sensors to mechanobiology, an emerging field of science, would provide new biological concepts; clarifying the mechanics in cellular systems and mechanical basis of tissue regulation.",
