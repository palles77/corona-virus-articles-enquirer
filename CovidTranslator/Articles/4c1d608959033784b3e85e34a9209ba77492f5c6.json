            "text": "The outbreak of an epidemical pneumonia with initially unknown reasons in December 2019 in Wuhan, China was ultimately found to be caused by a new virus, the \"2019 novel Coronavirus\" (2019-nCoV) or SARS-CoV-2 formally named by the World Committee on Virus Classification, [1] [2] [3] and the disease caused by this virus was named as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. 4 , 5 This virus has a characteristic crown representing the spike peplomers on the viral envelope, with strong infectivity and general suscepti-bility to people of all ages and across the globe. On the 8th February 2020, the disease was named as \"Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP)\" in China. 6 By February 16, 2020, China had reported a cumulative total of 70,548 patients being infected with SARS-CoV-2, 57,934 cases currently treated (10,644 severe cases), 1770 deaths, 10,844 cases being discharged from hospitals, 7264 suspected cases and 546,016 cases in close contact including 150,539 people being isolated and closely watched. The SARS-CoV-2 is primarily propagated through respiratory droplets and close contact, with the incubation period usually between 1 and 14 days and the typical symptoms after onset of fever, dry cough, fatigue and gradual appearance of dyspnea. People carrying this virus are the source of infection even in the incubation period, and early diagnosis of this disease or carrier of the virus is crucial to preventing it from further spread. However, confirmation of infection of this virus requires presence of the virus nucleic acid detected in swabs, secretions and sputum from the respiratory tract, blood or stools. 7 Nonetheless, detection of the virus nucleic acid may not be convenient, and early diagnosis of the NCP is essential for timely isolation and treatment of the patient. Computed tomography (CT) is easily available and can be used to screen patients for rapid confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infected NCP because CT, especially high resolution CT, has the advantages of high spatial resolution, freedom of disturbance from other structures outside the scanning plane and ability to display every details of the lesion in multiple planes and directions. This study was performed to analyze the clinical and CT imaging features in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infected NCP or COVID-19 and to familiarize radiologists and doctors with the common clinical and CT imaging findings of this disease for quick recognition, rapid isolation and treatment of the patient.",

Severe and critically severe NCP involved more commonly 4-5 lobes and most significantly ( P < 0.05) bilateral lower and upper lobes compared with common NCP. The lesion was primarily located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible extension towards the pulmonary hilum in big lesions or when the disease is deteriorated. In a short period of time, the lesion may change quickly with occurrence of new lesions in other areas of the lung or improvement at three days after treatment, necessitating repeated CT imaging scan for guiding disease progression and implementing proper treatment. NCP should be differentiated from other pneumonia caused by other viruses like influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and SARS-CoV or by other microorganisms including Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and bacteria. Bacterial pneumonia presents as small pieces of shadow distributing along the bronchus, which can fuse into a large lesion or a large piece of consolidation. Laboratory tests can show increased count of leukocytes in bacterial pneumonia for differentiation. Other viruses cause pneumonia with large diffused lesions of ground glass opacity in both lungs accompanied with interlobular septa, which may be difficult to differentiate from SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, however, definite epidemical history is useful for this disease. Virus nucleic acid detection helps determine the diagnosis.",

The lesion may have quick changes with formation of new lesions in other areas and extend from the peripheral to the central area if deteriorated. Repeated CT scanning is helpful for monitoring disease progression and implementing timely treatment.",
