            "text": "The elderly have defective host defenses that compromise their ability to ward off infectious agents; factors influencing immunocompetence include immune senescence, changes in nonadaptive immunity, chronic diseases, medications, malnutrition, and functional impairments. T-lymphocyte production and proliferation decline with age, resulting in decreased cell-mediated immunity and decreased antibody production to new antigens (3) (4) (5) . Thinning skin, enlarged prostate, diminished cough reflex, and other anatomic or physiologic accompaniments of aging are changes in nonadaptive immunity that render the elderly more vulnerable to infection. Chronic diseases-cancer, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, dementia-predispose to certain types of infection. Medications such as sedatives, narcotics, anticholinergics, and gastric acid suppressants may further suppress innate defenses. Malnutrition, which reduces cellmediated immunity, is common in nursing home residents (4) and may be more common in the geriatric community at large than is generally realized (6) . Finally, functional impairments (e.g., immobility, incontinence, dysphagia) can complicate aging and enhance susceptibility to infection. These impairments may necessitate the use of urinary catheters, feeding tubes, and other invasive devices that magnify susceptibility.",

However, this risk steadily rose from the fifth decade onward, exceeding 100 infections per 1,000 discharges in patients >70 years of age (8) . Finally, Saviteer and coworkers, who reported a similar increase in nosocomial infections after the fifth decade (9), calculated daily nosocomial infection rates of 0.43% and 0.63% for persons aged <60 years and >60 years, respectively.

The frequent movement of patients between hospitals and nursing homes undoubtedly facilitates the transfer of resistant microbes (24) . During the last 2 decades, gramnegative uropathogens with multidrug resistance and methicillin-resistant S. aureus have received the most attention (25) . Gram-negative enteric bacilli have recently become resistant to fluoroquinolones and extended-spectrum cephalosporins (26) . In addition, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and penicillin-resistant pneumococci have been identified in long-term care facilities (27) (28) (29) . The appearance of the latter organism, which is seldom regarded as a nosocomial pathogen, again underscores the unique situation of this health-care setting. Because of the frequent interchange of patients between hospitals and nursing homes, infections caused by antimicrobial drug-resistant bacteria will continue to emerge in geriatric populations.",

Recent guidelines have addressed requirements for infection control programs, as well as influenza, antimicrobial use, and antimicrobial resistant pathogens (25, (30) (31) (32) . Although reports from the 1980s described numerous deficiencies in infection control practices in nursing homes, recent reports have been more encouraging (4, 33, 34) . A survey of 136 long-term care facilities in New England indicated that 98% had persons dedicated to infection control activities for a median of 8 hours per week (33) . Nevertheless, protection of the vulnerable elderly residents in nursing homes merits additional attention, and changes in nursing home licensure and certification requirements may be needed at both state and national levels (35) . Surveillance activity in less conventional care settings is a necessary first step in evaluating potential hazards.",

Infection control practitioners and hospital epidemiologists are well advised to follow and study the aging population in the evolving health-care system.
