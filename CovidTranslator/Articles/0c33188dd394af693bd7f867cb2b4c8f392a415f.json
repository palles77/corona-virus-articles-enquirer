            "text": "We have previously observed that all known HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are highly divergent from germline antibodies in contrast to bnAbs against Hendra virus, Nipah virus and SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV). We have hypothesized that because the germline antibodies are so different from the mature HIV-1-specific bnAbs they may not bind the epitopes of the mature antibodies and provided the first evidence to support this hypothesis by using individual putative germline-like predecessor antibodies. To further validate the hypothesis and understand initial immune responses to different viruses, two phage-displayed human cord blood-derived IgM libraries were constructed which contained mostly germline antibodies or antibodies with very low level of somatic hypermutations. They were panned against different HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs), SARS CoV protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), and soluble Hendra virus G protein (sG). Despite a high sequence and combinatorial diversity observed in the cord blood-derived IgM antibody repertoire, no enrichment for binders of Envs was observed in contrast to considerable specific enrichments produced with panning against RBD and sG; one of the selected monoclonal antibodies (against the RBD) was of high (nM) affinity with only few somatic mutations. These results further support and expand our initial hypothesis for fundamental differences in immune responses leading to elicitation of bnAbs against HIV-1 compared to SARS CoV and Hendra virus. HIV-1 uses a strategy to minimize or eliminate strong binding of germline antibodies to its Env; in contrast, SARS CoV and Hendra virus, and perhaps other viruses causing acute infections, can bind germline antibody or minimally somatically mutated antibodies with relatively high affinity which could be one of the reasons for the success of sG and RBD as vaccine immunogens.",

            "text": "Elicitation of potent, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV-1 by immunization remains a challenge. We had previously hypothesized that HIV-1 may use conserved structures that cannot initiate immune responses because of the existence of ''holes'' in the human germline B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire, i.e., lack of germline antibodies capable of binding those structures [1] . In support of this hypothesis, we showed that germline-like antibodies corresponding most closely to known HIV-1 bnAbs such as b12, 2G12 and 2F5 lack measurable binding to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) [1] . This observation led to investigation of the maturation pathways of two HIV-1 bnAbs b12 and X5 [2] , whose structures and functions are well known [3, 4] , as well as to the identification and characterization of several human IgMderived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) selected from a large phage-displayed na\u00efve human antibody library constructed from 59 healthy donors [5] . These studies demonstrated that germline intermediates corresponding to b12 also fail to bind the Env with high affinity, whereas the X5 putative germline-like predecessor antibody and other IgM-derived mAbs which diverged less from their corresponding germlines have high binding affinity for the Env; however, the latter enhanced or did not potently neutralize infection by HIV-1 primary isolates. Further studies on B cell lineages and maturation pathways of HIV-1 bnAbs may sidestep this impediment to HIV-1 vaccine developments [6] .",

Human umbilical cord blood B lymphocytes that presumably have not been exposed to exogenous antigens have been used as a source of naturally-occurring germline or minimally-mutated pre-immune antibodies [10, 11] . For this reason, cord blood-derived IgM libraries might serve as a relevant source for selecting the closest germline antibodies corresponding to broadly neutralizing mAbs if they exhibit binding to target antigens. The current study addresses the hypothesis that the human cord blood does not contain high-affinity binders to HIV-1, although it has high-affinity antibodies against other human infectious agents such as SARS CoV and henipaviruses.",

Specific enrichment was determined by using polyclonal phage-based ELISA (ppELISA). Briefly, ppELISA was performed by using Corning high-binding 96-well plates coated with 1 lg/ml of antigen and blocked with 3% non-fat dry milk in PBS (MPBS). The microplate wells were inoculated with 50 ll per well of MPBS containing 10 10 PFU of pooled phage purified from each round of panning for 2 h at room temperature. Following 4 washes with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), bound phage was detected by adding 50 ll of 1:5000 diluted HRP-conjugated mouse anti-M13 antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) to each well. Following incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the plates were washed 4 times with PBST and the assay was developed at 37\u00b0C with ABST substrate (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and absorbance monitored at 405 nm. Clones that specifically bound to antigens were identified from the fourth round by using monoclonal phage ELISA (mpELISA) as described [8] .",

In contrast, the light chains were significantly less mutated, with 57.6% and 73.0% of the KVs and the LVs, respectively, giving translations identical to germlines. The numbers of mutations occurring in the J regions of heavy and light chains were also calculated. Similarly to what was observed with the variable regions, relatively more mutations were observed in the HJs than in the KJs and LJs (Fig. 2B) . The mutations in D regions were not estimated because of the difficulties in determining the D gene germlines for many antibodies due to the events of recombination involving insertion and deletion. These results suggest that the sequence diversity of the libraries is likely to be high although the light chains appear to be less diverse than the heavy chains, and the libraries exhibit low levels of somatic hypermutations.",

In addition, it was found that germline-like predecessors of several HIV-1 bnAbs lack measurable binding to HIV-1 Envs [1] . Based on these findings, we hypothesized that there is a scarcity or absence of high affinity binders to HIV-1 Envs in the minimally somatically-hypermutated human cord blood antibody repertoire, whereas high affinity antibodies against other human infectious agents including SARS CoV and henipaviruses can be easily found. To test this hypothesis, the combined cord blood library of ml32 and ml33was panned against gp140 Con-s , a synthetic Env designed by aligning the consensus Env sequences of group M [15] , and the Hendra virus protein sG in parallel. After four rounds of panning, enrichment and binding specificity of pooled phage were determined by ppELISA. Interestingly, significant and specific enrichment was observed with selection against sG only (Fig. 3) . In a separate experiment, the mixed library was panned against another Env, gp120 Bal , and simultaneously the RBD. In line with previous observations, no marked enrichment was achieved with panning against gp120 Bal while considerable and specific enrichment was seen when the library was panned against the RBD (Fig. 3) . These results support the hypothesis and suggest that HIV-1 Envs could have evolved strategies to avoid binding to the germline repertoire by presenting epitopes unsuitable for minimally somatically-diversified human antibodies to bind with, thereby denying them the chance to bind with high affinity. This strategy may represent a way exploited by the virus to escape from strong immune responses. ",

M390 has only 2 AA mutations each in the V regions of both heavy and light chains and no mutations in the D and J regions. The purified soluble m390 Fab bound to SARS CoV RBD with an EC 50 of about 50 nM while no binding to an irrelevant antigen gp120 Bal was observed suggesting the specificity of the binding (Fig. 4B) . Previously, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) specific antibodies with V H Q52/V j 19-28 gene combination elicited in a mouse model were found devoid of somatic mutations but showed high binding avidities [23] .

However, considerable specific enrichments were seen after panning against the SARS CoV RBD and Hendra virus sG, yielding an antibody against the RBD whose sequence is close to its parent germline. As we used the whole Envs in this study, one would expect the binding activity due to highly immunogenic epitopes such as the V3 loop which actually could bind and initiate immune response though it may be capable of diverting immune responses from the conserved epitopes. Therefore, the fact that there is no relatively high affinity binding of Envs might indicate that immune responses may not be so fast or in general are different than in the case of the other viruses. These results provide further evidence supporting and expanding the hypothesis that HIV-1 uses a strategy based on absent or weak binding of its conserved epitopes to germline antibodies for escaping neutralizing immune responses.",
