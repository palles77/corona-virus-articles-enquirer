These proteins also exist in fish, however, their roles in the innate immune response remain unknown. Here, we report a characterization of teleost IFITM1 from flounder Paralichthys olivaceus (PoIFITM1), which exhibits conserved structure characteristic of the IFITM family but comprises a relatively longer N-terminal region. The expression and promoter activity of PoIFITM1 are markedly induced by aquatic animal viruses: Rana grylio virus (RGV) and Scophthalmus maximus rhabdovirus (SMRV). Overexpression and siRNA-mediated knockdown demonstrate that PoI-FITM1 exhibits strong antiviral effects against both DNA virus (RGV) and RNA virus (SMRV), expanding the spectrum of viruses inhibited by IFITM proteins. Further analysis shows that PoIFITM1 suppresses viral entry into host cells, confirming that the IFITM-mediated restriction is conserved from lower vertebrates to mammals. Deletion mutagenesis reveals that PoIFITM1 exerts antiviral activity by targeting to Golgi complex and the N-terminal region is required for its subcellular localization, which is not observed in other known IFITM family members. Our current data provide the first evidence that IFITM1 functions as a key effector of the innate immune to restrict virus replication in lower vertebrates, through the action of impeding viral entry.",

IFITM proteins are the only known innate immune effector that inhibits viral entry. They suppressed infection of retroviruses pseudotyped with entry proteins of IFITM-restricted viruses [6e8], which firstly localized the IFITM-mediated restriction to the entry step in the virus replication cycle. Imaging studies provided direct evidence that IFITM proteins prevent viruses from fusing with late endosomal or lysosomal membranes [7, 12] , most likely through reducing membrane fluidity and fusion potential [13] .",

Some studies suggested that the IFITM-mediated restriction might be a conserved characteristic in vertebrates [20] . Indeed, four members of IFITM family (IFITM1, 2, 3, and 5) have been annotated in fish genome, which display an orthologous relationship with mammalian counterparts [20] . The expression of IFITMs was induced by PolyI:C in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea) [21, 22] , suggesting their roles in IFN-mediated antiviral immune. However, so far there are no direct evidences whether fish IFITMs possess the ability to restrict virus infection, and how they exert the antiviral activity.",

Two highly conserved cysteine residues of S-palmitoylation [30, 31] were also found in the first transmembrane domain (Cys 90, Cys 91) (Fig. 1B) .

            "text": "Emerging lines of evidence have demonstrated that IFITMs disrupt the entry step of virus infection [12, 13] . The following observations suggest that action mechanism of PoIFITM1 is similar to that of mammals. First, the virus binding and entry experiment revealed that viral particles entering into the cells to proceed replication were greatly reduced, in the presence of PoIFITM1. Second, PoIFITM1 colocalized with endocytosis marker proteins. The association between IFITM2, 3 and endocytosed transferrin has been observed in mammals, whereas IFITM1 barely exhibited colocalization with transferrin [8] . This is most likely because transferrin is a clathrin-mediated endocytic marker. Indeed, when we incubated cells with CTxB, a caveola-mediated endocytosis marker [34] , an extensive colocalization was seen. Moreover, PoI-FITM1 colocalized with CAV1, which is an essential component of caveolae and functions in the endocytosis [35] . IFITM1 has been suggested to interact and form a complex with CAV1 to function in some processes including endocytosis [36] . These findings indicate that PoIFITM1 associates with endocytic compartments. Finally, PoIFITM1 displayed a unique characteristic not observed in other known IFITM family members: subcellular distribution within the Golgi apparatus. The localization of IFITM proteins correlates with their antiviral function. Mammalian IFITMs have been described to reside in late endosomes or lysosome, where they prevent viruses fuse with host cell membranes, and thereby restrict virus replication [12] . Our recent studies have discovered that RGV entered FEC cells via a pH-dependent caveola-mediated endocytosis (J. Wang, R. Zhu and Q. Y. Zhang, unpublished data). In this entry route, the endocytosed virus requires access to acidic organelle to undergo viral-host membrane fusion. The Golgi complex is a potential fusion site for these viruses [37] . It raises the possibility that PoIFITM1 may target to the Golgi, and it is thus able to block viral membrane fusion process. Further investigation should be needed to elucidate the mechanism by which PoIFITM1 restricts virus infection with the Golgi targeting capability.",

PoIFITM1 has a relatively longer N-terminal region. Deletion mutagenesis revealed that this region was crucial for the antiviral function of IFITM1, as in the case of other viruses studied [10, 16] . Due to the removing of the N-terminal region, the colocalization of PoIFITM1 with endocytosis markers as well as with Golgi was abolished; therefore PoIFITM1 lost the chance to encounter the endocytosed viral particles. This finding is consistent with a recent study that N-terminal region of IFITM3 modulates its antiviral activity by controlling the cellular localization [16] . Collectively, the data presented in the current study demonstrate that a functional IFITM1 ortholog exits in fish. RGV is a pathogen that causes lethal disease in aquaculture animals [24, 38] . Strategies that effectively induce IFITM1 activity could serve as potent therapeutic approaches for treatment against RGV infection. Therefore, our results also pave the way for future development of antiviral agents for controlling infection by pathogenic viruses in fish.",

(A) IFITM1 (EGFP, green) could colocalized (Merge, yellow) with the endocytic markers (CTxB, CAV1; Red), whereas IFITM1 DN (EGFP, green) could not colocalized with these proteins (Red). (B) IFITM1 (EGFP, green) were distributed in cytoplasmic and concentrated in the perinuclear region, which was localized to Golgi (Red) but excluded from mitochondria (Mito, Red) or endoplasmic reticulum (ER, Red). Green fluorescence of the truncation (IFITM1 DN) was distributed diffusely in the cells and absent from Golgi (Red), which indicated that the N-terminal region of IFITM1 was responsible for subcelluar localization. Blue fluorescence showed the nuclei stained by Hoechst 33342. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)",
