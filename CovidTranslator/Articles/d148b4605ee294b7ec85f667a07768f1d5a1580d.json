AviTagbiotinylated M13 phage were functionalized with antibodies using avidin-biotin conjugation and fluorescently labeled with AlexaFluor 555. Individual phage bound to target viruses (here MS2 as a model) captured on an LFA membrane strip were imaged using epi-fluorescence microscopy. Using automated image processing, we counted the number of bound phage in micrographs as a function of target concentration. The resultant assay was more sensitive than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and traditional colloidal-gold nanoparticle LFAs for direct detection of viruses. .

This need poses a special challenge in economically challenged areas with limited laboratory infrastructure where these viruses are often endemic. Early diagnosis under these conditions is aided by point-of-care (POC) diagnostics 3 that are able to detect viruses at low concentrations and without involved sample preparation. Traditional techniques for detecting viruses, including plaque assays and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), [4] [5] often require complex laboratory equipment and trained personnel and are therefore poorly suited for early diagnosis in these settings.",

            "text": "Lateral flow assays (LFAs) are a rapid, cheap, and simple option for POC diagnosis. 6 In a typical LFA format, a biological sample containing an analyte is dispensed onto the sample pad of a porous membrane strip and transported through it by capillary action; antibodies bound to the membrane capture the analytes as they flow through the strip. Reporter particles also transported by the flow are then analyte-bridged and arrested by antibodies at the test line to produce an easily discernible line on the strip as a positive result. LFAs using gold, dyed latex, or carbon nanoparticles as reporters require minimal sample preparation and hence are routinely used in research and clinical applications. 7 Traditional nanoparticlebased LFAs 6-8 , however, typically cannot detect viral antigens at concentrations in clinically-useful ranges (e.g. 10 3 -10 6 viral particles per mL for HIV-1 9 , 10 1 -10 6 plaque forming units per mL for Ebola 10 , and 10 1 -10 4 plaque forming units per mL for dengue 11 ) due to limited readout; for example, colloidal gold LFAs for Japanese encephalitis virus can detect viruses at a concentration of 2.5 \u00d7 10 6 pfu/mL 12 and filamentous Escherichia coli M13 bacteriophage (phage) at a concentration of 5 \u00d7 10 7 pfu/mL. 13 By contrast, complex laboratory methods such as plaque counting and polymerase chain reaction have much lower limits of detection. [4] [5] For LFAs to be most useful as early diagnostics for viral diseases, new reporter technologies are needed with increased sensitivity and decreased limits of detection.",

Phage surfaces can be genetically and chemically engineered to display a wide range of functional groups, including antibodies, aptamers, lectins, peptides, proteins, and enzymes, 14-15 enabling recognition and readout. This property allows engineered phage to serve as universal biodetection reporters in diagnostic assays, [16] [17] [18] [19] including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) 20-23 and colorimetric LFAs. 24 In addition, phage bearing fluorescent moieties have been employed in a variety of biodetection assays that use flow cytometry [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] or fluorescence microscopy 27, 30-31 as readouts. Such fluorescently-labeled phage are of particular interest for use in LFAs, as many phage (e.g. M13, T7) are large enough to be imaged using optical microscopy as diffraction-limited objects when labeled with fluorescent dyes [32] [33] and hence can be singly counted using automated image-processing routines. 34 We therefore posited that the combination of coat protein engineering and fluorescence could enable a new LFA readout, in which phage reporters bound to analytes are singly counted, that may increase LFA sensitivity.",

            "text": "Here, we report a lateral-flow immunoassay based on enumerating individual fluorescently labeled bacteriophage reporters. We first developed a protocol to fluorescently label the p8 major coat proteins of M13, and then functionalized the p3 tail protein displaying a biotinylatable AviTag peptide with antibodies to MS2, a widely used model for viral pathogens. At each step in the protocol we confirmed that reporters were successfully modified using ELISA, 4\u2032-hydroxyazobenzene-2-carboxylic acid (HABA) assay, and a magnetic particle counting assay. In the LFA, Fusion 5 membranes were functionalized with test and control lines that contain antibodies to MS2 and to the M13 reporter, respectively, as shown in Figure 1 . Defined numbers of MS2 phage were flowed through the LFA matrix  and captured at the test line, which contained anti-MS2 antibodies. Fluorescent M13  reporters functionalized with anti-MS2 antibodies subsequently flowed through the strip  were captured by the MS2 on the test line and by anti-M13 antibodies on the control line. We acquired fluorescence micrographs at the test, transition, and control lines and used automated image-processing algorithms to count the number of reporter phage at each location at the single-label level. The limit of detection (LoD) of this assay, determined from the 95% confidence intervals on the number of counted M13 reporters, is 10 2 plaqueforming units (pfu) in a 10 Jl sample deposited onto the sample pad at the end of the LFA strip, lower than that reported for colloidal-gold LFAs for viruses [12] [13] or an ELISA for MS2 virus 35 . We anticipate that the imaging assay developed here can be integrated with inexpensive detection technologies, including paper microfluidics [36] [37] and smartphonebased fluorescence imaging, [38] [39] to enable point-of-care rapid diagnostics for viruses in resource-limited settings.",

We mixed magnetic particles functionalized with a variety of proteins with FluorM13 phage bearing biotin, neutravidin, or antibodies to the model virus MS2 and counted the fraction of magnetic particles that were fluorescent, signifying binding of the phage (additional details are given in the Supporting Information). For each pair of particle and phage surface chemistries, the fluorescence signal was consistent with that expected from the surface chemistries. In pairs in which specific binding was expected (e.g. between a magnetic particle functionalized with antibodies to M13 and any of the FluorM13 phage, Figure 4a , b and c) a large fraction of magnetic particles were fluorescent, confirming good binding between phage and particles. Conversely, in those cases in which specific binding was not expected (e.g. between biotin-functionalized particles and biotin-conjugated FluorM13 phage, Figure 4g ) few magnetic particles were fluorescent, confirming that the phage did not bind non-specifically to the particles. We attributed the affinity of the anti-MS2 Ab FluorM13 phage for neutravidin-coated magnetic particles (Figure 4f) to the presence of excess biotins on the anti-MS2 antibody, which may bind to the neutravidin on the particles.",

The average number of bound reporters per micrograph acquired at the test line increased with increasing concentration of analyte MS2 viruses (Figure 7) but at a rate that was significantly less than linear: as the MS2 concentration was increased from 10 2 to 10 7 pfu per 10 \u03bcL, the number of bound phage increased by a factor of 5. The lack of proportionality between signal and offered analyte concentration, also observed in other assays with phage reporters, 19, 24 likely arose from steric hindrance and the great heterogeneity of the binding sites offered by the LFA matrix. The number of bound reporters in the transition area, by contrast, remained constant and independent of analyte concentration. The average number of bound reporters at the test and transition regions was different at a significance level of p < 0.05 for all analyte concentrations tested down to 10 2 pfu per 10 \u03bcL, corresponding to a titer of 10 4 pfu/mL ( Table 1 in Supporting Information). Additionally, the 95% confidence intervals for samples with nonzero MS2 concentration down to 10 2 pfu per 10 \u03bcL, indicated by the notches in Figure 7 , did not overlap with that of the zero MS2 concentration at the test line. Using as the criterion for the limit of detection the lack of overlap in the 95% confidence intervals of the number of bound M13 reporters, these results suggested that this assay could be used to detect as few as 10 2 pfu per 10 \u03bcL. An independent replicate of the assay exhibited an identical limit of detection ( Figure S4 in Supporting Information). We concluded that the limit of detection of this assay was ~10 2 pfu/strip. This LoD was approximately onehundred-fold better than that reported for virus LFAs using gold nanoparticles as reporters [12] [13] and that reported for an ELISA 35 for MS2.",

An ideal strip for this assay allows easy transport of the reporters to all antibody-functionalized sites and aids capture of the reporters; in future work we therefore plan to vary the strip material as well as the size and arrangement of the pores therein. Finally, because reporters must be readily transported throughout the strip, we surmise that the shape of the reporter phage may affect the LoD; to test this idea, we will test the efficacy of functionalized viral nanoparticles of varying morphologies as reporters in this assay.",

The MS2 viruses were dispensed onto distal end of strips that were then washed in buffer. The FluorM13 reporters were spotted on the strips to sandwich MS2 viruses at the test line. Fluorescence micrographs were acquired at the test line, transition, and control line and analyzed using automated-image-processing routines to count the FluorM13 reporters. FluorM13 functionalized with biotin, neutravidin, anti-MS2 antibody were captured by anti-M13 antibody-magnetic particles (a, b and c). Neutravidin magnetic particles showed high binding affinity with Biotin-FluorM13 (d). The affinity between neutravidin-magnetic particles and anti-MS2 Ab FluorM13 (f) was ascribed to excess biotins on the biotinylated anti-MS2 antibody based on the result of the HABA assay. The third (g, h and i) and fourth (j, k and l) rows showed that biotin-FluorM13 undergo successful neutravidin and anti-MS2 Ab conjugation, respectively. The bar graphs showed the fraction of fluorescence magnetic particles bearing bound FluorM13, corresponding to the representative micrographs. Error bars were standard deviations from twenty images analyzed for each pair of magnetic particles and modified FluorM13. All images were acquired with identical imaging conditions (camera gain = 8, camera exposure time = 0.3 sec, 100\u00d7 objective lens). For each concentration of MS2/strip, two fluorescence micrographs acquired at the control (top; saturated white), transition (middle), and test (bottom) lines are shown. Each micrograph was of dimension 130 \u00d7 130 Jm 2 and the area of the antibody spotted onto Fusion 5 strips was ~ 1 mm 2 , so that at most sixty micrographs could be acquired from each antibody spot at a two dimensional plane. In the assay, twenty micrographs were acquired at the control, transition, and test lines of an LFA strip. We observed high fluorescence intensity at the control lines, leading to the bright white images. Although individual FluorM13 reporters cannot be distinguished at the control line, the high fluorescence intensity showed that sufficient FluorM13 reporters migrate along the length of the strip. The number of FluorM13 reporters bound at the test line increased with increasing number of MS2 per strip, and remained invariant at the transition area. further downstream from the test line). Strips were loaded with 10 JL MS2 virus solution at various concentrations. FluorM13 reporters were counted from twenty micrographs acquired for each MS2 virus concentration using an automated counting program. All test lines of LFA strips were distinguishable from the corresponding backgrounds at a statistical significance level of p < 0.05 using the t-test. The position of the notches indicated the 95% confidence interval; notches for images acquired at the test line for each the nonzero MS2 concentrations did not overlap with that for zero MS2 concentration.",
