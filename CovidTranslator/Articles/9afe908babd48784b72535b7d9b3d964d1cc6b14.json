This study aims to investigate the effects and mode-of-action of 6-TG on rotavirus replication. Human intestinal Caco2 cell line, 3D model of human primary intestinal organoids, laboratory rotavirus strain (SA11) and patient-derived rotavirus isolates were used. We have demonstrated that 6-TG significantly inhibits rotavirus replication in these intestinal epithelium models. Importantly, gene knockdown or knockout of Rac1, the cellular target of 6-TG, significantly inhibited rotavirus replication, indicating the supportive role of Rac1 for rotavirus infection. We have further demonstrated that 6-TG can effectively inhibit the active form of Rac1 (GTP-Rac1), which essentially mediates the anti-rotavirus effect of 6-TG. Consistently, ectopic over-expression of GTP-Rac1 facilitates but an inactive Rac1 (N17) or a specific Rac1 inhibitor (NSC23766) inhibits rotavirus replication. In conclusion, we have identified 6-TG as an effective inhibitor of rotavirus replication via the inhibition of Rac1 activation. Thus, for transplantation patients or IBD patients infected with rotavirus or at risk of rotavirus infection, the choice of 6-TG as a treatment appears rational.",

Although rotavirus infection mainly occurs in developing countries, it also results in over 200 deaths and more than 87,000 hospital admissions in infants in European Union (Vesikari et al., 2007) . Besides young children, organ transplantation patients are also susceptible to rotavirus infection irrespective of their age, causing long-term diarrhea and even death due to graft failure (Yin et al., 2015b) .

Rotavirus was serially passaged in MA104 or Caco2 cells exposed to no 6-TG (as control) and increasing concentrations of 6-TG until 20 passages (infected cultures were exposed to 1000 ng/mL of 6-TG in passage 1-10; whereas the drug concentration was increased to 2000 ng/mL at the subsequent later passages). The effect of 6-TG (100 ng/mL) on passage 5, 10, 15 and 20 (the drug treated and untreated) of rotavirus was quantified using qRT-PCR. 6-TG retained its anti-rotavirus activity even with continuous exposure to 6-TG for 20 passages in MA104 cells (A) and Caco2 cells (B).",

Thus, 6-TG indirectly provokes inhibition of Rac1-dependent signaling (Shin et al., 2016) , which has substantial consequences for cellular physiology. As a member of the Ras superfamily of Rho GTPases, GTPbound Rac1 mediates a myriad of cellular processes including actin reorganization and gene transcription. Intriguingly, IBD is characterized by hyperactivation of Rac1 in the phagocyte compartment. This is associated with reduced effector function of Rac1, which is sensitive to 6-TG treatment (Parikh et al., 2014) . The inhibition of Rac1 resulting from 6-TG treatment restores innate immune functionality of phagocytes in IBD patients, contributing to disease remission (Parikh et al., 2014) . Thus, Rac1 hyperactivation appears an important immunosuppressive effector in human pathophysiology, at least in the phagocyte compartment. Given the clinical relevance and the potential in revealing mechanistic insight, we have investigated the effects and mechanism-ofaction of 6-TG on rotavirus replication. To this end, we have demonstrated that 6-TG effectively combats rotavirus replication through inhibition of Rac1 activation.",

This resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of rotavirus RNA replication (Fig. 1A , n = 3-17, *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001). The IC 50 value of 6-TG against SA11 rotavirus was 3.0 \u00d7 10 \u221213 M, which is substantially below the concentrations reached in patients undergoing 6-TG or azathioprine therapy. CC 50 of 6-TG to Caco2 cells was 9.8 \u00d7 10 \u22126 M and selectivity index (SI, CC 50 / IC 50 ) was 3.3 \u00d7 10 7 (Table S2 ). This was further confirmed at the infectious virus production levels and protein levels of the rotavirus VP4 protein ( Fig. 1B and C) . To further verify the effect of 6-TG on rotavirus replication, SA11 rotavirus-infected Caco2 cells were treated with 6-TG at different time points (6, 12, 24 and 48 h), demonstrating that 6-TG significantly inhibited rotavirus RNA replication in time-dependent Manner (Fig. 1D , n = 4-8, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01). These results were substantiated by experiments in human primary intestinal organoids, a model system that recapitulates many aspects of the intestinal epithelium, including the presence of a villus domain and a crypt domain ( Fig. 1E ) (Sato and Clevers, 2013) . 6-TG significantly inhibited SA11 rotavirus replication and virus production in these organoids ( Fig. 1F and G, n = 6, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01). Our results were essentially repeated using five patient-derived rotavirus isolates in Caco2 cells but also in human intestinal organoids (Table S3) . Treatment with 100 ng/mL 6-TG inhibited patient-derived isolates in both Caco2 cells (Fig. 1H ) and human intestinal organoids (Fig. 1I) . Hence, 6-TG significantly counteracts rotavirus replication at clinically relevant concentrations.",

As a control, wild-type SA11 rotavirus was passaged in the absence of the drug. During the initial ten passages, infected cultures were exposed to 1000 ng/mL of 6-TG; whereas the drug concentration was increased to 2000 ng/mL at the subsequent later passages. After 20 passages, the effects of 6-TG (100 ng/mL) on each representative passage (both drug treated and untreated) of rotavirus was quantified by qRT-PCR. Our results indicate that rotavirus remains sensitive to 6-TG treatment in MA104 cells ( Fig. 2A) and Caco2 cells (Fig. 2B) . Therefore, rotavirus does not easily develop 6-TG resistance, suggesting that the antiviral effects of 6-TG likely depend on a cellular target but not a direct interaction with the virus itself.",

Thus, we investigated the potential role of Rac1 on rotavirus replication. To this end, we performed a lentiviral RNAi-mediated loss-of-function assay to silence the Rac1 gene. Two (no. 9689 and 9691) out of five RNAi vectors showed potent knockdown of the target gene (Fig. 3A) . Importantly, these two RNAi vectors resulted in 65.0 \u00b1 0.1% (n = 10, P < 0.001) and 61.8 \u00b1 0.2% (n = 6, P < 0.05) reduction of SA11 rotavirus viral RNA, respectively (Fig. 3B) . In apparent agreement, we obtained Rac1 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts cells (MEFs), and their status as a bona fide knockout was confirmed by western blot assay (Fig. 3C) . Rotavirus replication in Rac1 knockout MEFs (\u2212/\u2212) was significantly less efficient (62.4 \u00b1 0.2%; n = 4; P < 0.05), compared with the replication in wild type MEF (lf/lf) (Fig. 3D) . Thus, decreased Rac1 levels correlate with increased resistance towards rotavirus replication.",

Based on the findings presented in the current study, the choice of 6-TG for these patients appears rational, in particular when they are at risk of rotavirus infection (Yin et al., 2015b) .",

As a major player of the Rho family of small GTPases, Rac1 plays a vital role in various cellular signaling pathways to regulate a wide variety of cell functions including gene transcription, cell proliferation, apoptosis, motility, and redox signaling (D'Ambrosi et al., 2014) . The expression of Rac1 is ubiquitous, but it has two conformational states including an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form (Bosco et al., 2009) . It exerts biological functions mainly through activation of Rac1 (i.e. GTP-bound form) (Bosco et al., 2009) . Many viruses interfere with or employ the conformational states of Rac1 to regulate their infection. At early stages of African swine fever virus (ASFV) infection, Rac1 is activated, and inhibition of Rac1 is able to suppress production of this virus (Quetglas et al., 2012) . Rac1 is found to be activated during intracellular mature virus (MV) of Vaccinia virus entry (Mercer and Helenius, 2008) .",

More specifically, the activation of Rac1 is required as shown by the opposing effects of ectopic over-expression of the active or inactive forms of Rac1 on rotavirus replication. This mechanistically explains the potent anti-rotavirus effects of the GTP-Rac1 inhibitors, 6-TG and NSC23766. Of note, NSC23766 has been shown to inhibit the replication of several influenza viruses including a human virus strain from the 2009 pandemic and highly pathogenic avian virus strains (Dierkes et al., 2014) .",

Median fluorescence identity (MFIs) of control, N17 and V12 are 3.43, 35.5 and 84.3, respectively.
