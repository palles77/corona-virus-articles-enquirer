We undertook this qualitative study to contextualize epidemiological findings suggesting that HCWs elevated risk of drug-resistant TB is related to workplace exposure. 55 HCWs and 7 hospital managers participated in focus groups and interviews about infection control (IC). Participants discussed caring for patients with drug-resistant TB, IC measures, occupational health programs, and stigma and support in the workplace. Key themes included: 1) lack of resources that hinders IC, 2) distrust of IC efforts among HCWs, and 3) disproportionate focus on individual level personal protections, particularly N95 masks. IC programs should be evaluated, and the impact of new policies to rapidly diagnose drug-resistant TB and decentralize treatment should be assessed as part of the effort to control drug-resistant TB and create a safe workplace.",

IC programs include administrative guidelines for treating TB patients, environmental controls that reduce the concentration of infectious respiratory aerosols in the air, and personal protective equipment to reduce individual exposure. 17 A central tenet of IC planning is a \"hierarchy of controls\" that prioritizes administrative and environmental measures and relies on personal protections as a safeguard (not primary) method for reducing hazard exposure. 18, 19 Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced IC guidelines for resource constrained settings in HIV endemic regions that prioritize lowcost interventions including improved administrative planning and patient triage, natural ventilation, and treatment for HIV/AIDS. 19 KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province, the epicenter of the South African HIV/AIDS epidemic, has high rates of multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). 2 MDR-TB is resistant to the two most effective first-line TB drugs and XDR-TB is additionally resistant to 2 of the 3 most effective second-line drugs. 20 In a widely reported 2006 outbreak in rural (KZN), 52 of 53 patients with XDR-TB/HIV co-infection died, 2 of them HCWs. 4 In the setting of HIV co-infection, MDRTB cure rates are low, 21 and XDR-TB cure rates are dismal. 22 In 2010, we conducted a retrospective review of patients admitted to the provincial TB referral hospital in KZN 2003 KZN -2008 , and found that HCWs were five times more likely to have MDR-TB, and nearly seven times more likely to have XDR-TB compared to the general population. 23 Although we lack data to link increased rates with occupational exposure, they were not explained by HIV or other TB risk factors in HCWs.",

Delay in diagnosis, lack of space, and shortage of beds in referral hospitals hindered separation of drug-resistant TB patients and suspects; physical infrastructure design, poorly maintained equipment, and cold rooms hindered ventilation; and problems with the procurement system meant insufficient supplies of N95 masks.",

Introduction of a rapid TB diagnostic tool, GeneXpert, is expected to speed up MDR-TB diagnosis, 33 and faster initiation of treatment may reduce infectivity and TB exposures. 27 Future research should examine how these efforts at the systems level change attitudes and practice among hospital managers and HCWs.",

Gaps in the program undermine effectiveness. Failed administrative and environmental controls mean that personal protective measures (e.g. N95 masks) become the primary means of protection, leaving the burden of managing IC on individual HCWs.",
