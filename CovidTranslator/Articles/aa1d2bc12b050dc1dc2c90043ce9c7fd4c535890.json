Five of 12 patients lived; baseline characteristics did not predict mortality in this cohort. Finally, several case reports describe treatment with peramivir. In one case, a pediatric renal transplant patient with severe oseltamivir-resistant influenza A H1N1 recovered following peramivir therapy; however, this patient also had \"aggressive critical care support\" and reduction in his immunosuppression [7] . In 1 HSCT patient, peramivir was associated with recovery from severe pandemic influenza A H1N1, but peramivir use was concurrent with lymphocyte recovery and oseltamivir use and was preceded by triple combination antiviral therapy with oseltamivir, oral ribavirin, and oral amantadine, as well as inhaled ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin [8] . There were no detected oseltamivir H275Y resistance mutations. Additionally, the role of peramivir in the management of patients with documented resistance to oseltamivir has been called into question. In 1 allogeniec HSCT patient with oseltamivirresistant virus due to neuraminidase mutation H275Y, virus replication continued despite peramivir therapy [9] .

Investigational IV zanamivir has been available on a compassionate-use basis in the setting of failure of other antivirals, with contraindication to inhaled zanamivir, or as part of a clinical trial. Failure to absorb oseltamivir and the development of oseltamivirresistant (specifically, H275Y) mutations were reported as indications for usage [10] [11] [12] . In a retrospective study of IV zanamivir in critically ill patients with pandemic influenza A H1N1 who had already received at least 3 days of oseltamivir prior to IV zanamivir, 8 of 13 (62 %) were immunocompromised [11] . Seven of the patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 5 patients (63 %) died. Several case reports of pediatric immunocompromised hosts, including those with HSCT, leukemia, and liver transplantation, appear in the literature, predominantly with oseltamivir-resistant pandemic influenza H1N1 viral isolates. While survival results are mixed for these patients, most report a decrease in the viral load as evaluated by polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) threshold cycle values. Most of the remaining case reports relate to pediatric transplant patients, who had mixed survival results [13] [14] [15] [16] . Data on IV zanamivir in the immunocompromised population remain scant, but there may be benefit for its use in oseltamivir-resistant influenza infections.",

It has activity against influenza, measles, West Nile virus, RSV, and other viruses. When oral ribavirin became available, Pelaez described its use in conjunction with steroids in 5 adult lung transplant recipients, finding oral therapy less costly than aerosolization; this intervention was not directly compared with placebo or other formulations of ribavirin [26] . Additionally, a comparison between outcomes for lung transplant recipients receiving oral (n =6) and inhaled (n =15) ribavirin in conjunction with steroids and IVIG was performed at a single center. There were no significant differences reported for survival or BOS development/progression at 6 months postinfection in this cohort [27] . Studies assessing the concentration of oral ribavirin in lung fluid in transplant patients have not been conducted. Despite limited data on its efficacy in clearing RSV infection in solid organ transplant (SOT), ribavirin, especially in the aerosolized form, has additionally been evaluated in conjunction with other therapies, including steroids, IVIG, and palivizumab (see below), and remains a standard part of many local treatment protocols.",

New drugs are currently in development that could have a significant impact on treating these infections. Some of the drugs, such as laninamivir octanoate, are available in certain markets, while others can be accessed through the eIND mechanism in the United States. Still other antivirals are in early clinical and preclinical investigation stage. Additional investigation is needed, particularly in immunocompromised hosts, to expand the options for effective therapy for respiratory viral infections.",
