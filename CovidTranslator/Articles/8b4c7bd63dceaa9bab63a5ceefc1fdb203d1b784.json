Effects of 30 KM topsentin (l-hr exposures) on incorporation of radiolabeled precursors by P388 cells indicated inhibition of DNA synthesis (91%) and to a lesser extent RNA synthesis (57%), whereas synthesis of protein was unaffected (0%). Fluorescence spectral changes and competitive binding experiments with ethidium bromide indicated ihat topsentin interacted with DNA. No evidence for intercalation was observed in DNA unwinding studies, but competitive binding experiments with Hoechst 33342 and CC-1065 indicated that topsentin bound to DNI\\ in the minorgrobve.",

            "text": "Nonintercalative DNA groove-binding drugs exhibit a wide spectrum of antibacterial, antiprotozoal, antiviral, and antitumor activity. Drugs capable of interacting with the minor groove of DNA are structurally diverse compounds, and not surprisingly several distinct modes of binding have been observed. Netropsin and distamycin A reversibly bind to the minor groove of AT regions of B-DNA [l] . Similarly, 4',6-diamidine-2-phenylindole (DAPIO), bisbenzimide dyes, and the anti-trypanosomal drug, berenil, bind preferentially to AT-rich DNA within the minor groove of the helix [2] . A preference for GC sequences is shown by antitumor antibiotics of the aureolic acid group (mithramycin, olivomycin, and chromomycin), which also bind in the minor groove [3] . In contrast to these reversible physical interactions, CC-1065 and pyrrolo[l,4] benzodiazepines (anthramycin, tomaymycin, sibiromycin) bind covalently to DNA and the resulting drug adducts occupy the minor groove [4, 5] . Certain compounds that intercalate may also interact with the minor groove of DNA. Although the chromophore of actinomycin D intercalates between GC base pairs, the cyclic amino acid side chains are located in the minor groove and the carbonyl oxygen of the threonine moiety is hydrogen-bonded to the NH2 of guanine Recently, an X-ray diffraction analysis of the binding of nogalamycin to a thiophospho-containing DNA hexamer indicated an even more complex ligand-DNA interaction. Apparently, local transient melting of the DNA allows intercalation of the nogalamycin chromophore with the nogalose and aminoglucose sugars simultaneously binding in the minor and major grooves at opposite sides of the helix [8] .",

In addition, concentrations of CC-1065 that block division of tumor cells do not block progression through Sphase; instead an arrest in G2-M was observed. Effects on mitotic events following covalent binding of CC-1065 to DNA suggest that repair-related mechanisms may be important in the cytotoxicity of this agent and other groove binders that form covalent adducts. Distamycin A, bisbenzimide, and DAPI inhibit the DNA relaxing activity of mammalian topoisomerase I and, depending on concentration, stimulate or inhibit the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II [9, lo]. However, unlike camptothecin or doxorubicin [ll] , inhibition of the catalytic activity of either topoisomerase I or II in isolated enzyme reactions is not associated with DNA strand breakage. In addition to disrupting the catalytic activity of topoisomerases, minor groove binders also affect other DNA-directed enzymes. For example, the activities of DNA and RNA polymerases, DNAse I, and Sl nuclease have all been reported to be inhibited by compounds that final concentration.

Incorporation experiments with whole cells indicated that topsentin interfered with nucleic acid synthesis in a manner similar to agents known to bind DNA. Changes in the fluorescence spectra of topsentin in the presence of DNA and the ability of the compound to inhibit ethidium bromide binding to DNA demonstrated that topsentin interacted with this nucleic acid. Topsentin did not change the electrophoretic mobility of supercoiled circular DNA, suggesting that intercalation did not occur. In addition, when supercoiled DNA was exposed to various concentrations of topsentin, completely relaxed with topoisomerase I, and bound topsentin removed by phenol extraction, no supercoiled DNA became apparent after electrophoresis in agarose gels. After relaxation and removal of bound drug, the final state of supercoiling depends on the number of negative supercoils removed before relaxation. The lack of supercoiled DNA following treatment with topsentin, at concentrations of DNA far in excess of those required for cytotoxicity, indicates that this agent did not intercalate.",
