Scenarios for efficient crisis management and rapid effective disease control, for example, against an influenza pandemic, have been developed by the World Health Organization (WHO Global Influenza Program [100] ), the European Community [101] and the US Center of Disease Control, Atlanta [102] . However, prior to the current situation, few countries had implemented strategic plans at the national level and such scenarios have fortunately never before been validated on a global scale. Importantly, next to the undisputed practicality of strategic planning against the next influenza pandemic, which has to start during the current interpandemic period, a good level of preparedness of appropriate national and supranational structures may positively affect the speed and efficiency of the response to any emerging disease with pandemic potential. The current outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an unprecedented example of an emerging viral disease on a global scale. Beside the dramatic consequences of this crisis, important lessons will be learnt on how the world community is capable of appropriate reactions.",

The high profile of SARS in the international news media contributed to early public disease awareness but also caused fear in both affected and unaffected populations, placing additional political and economic pressure on authorities to act on the threat despite of an insufficient basis for informed decisions. International organizations, most prominently the WHO, played a crucial role in international co-ordination and local support of control measures as well as in information and know-how management.",

Within a very short period of time a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was established as the cause of SARS [1, 2] and the knowledge about this novel virus continues to expand at breathtaking speed on an almost daily basis.

However, travel restrictions, improved diagnostic tools and hygiene measures remain the main instruments in controlling the spread of SARS.

Individuals present at this gathering of selected global vaccine manufacturers were urged to use every endeavour in the rapid development of candidate vaccines against the SARS agent.

            "text": "In the case of SARS, the risks associated with the development of a vaccine increase under time pressure and due to the very limited basis of knowledge on the pathogen. It may be appropriate to remember that the usual time-to-market for a new drug or vaccine is 9-14 years, starting from the early feasibility research phase and including preclinical (process and immunological profile) development, clinical development and registration, as well as manufacturing plant planning and set-up [3] . Therefore, even if due to a very special emergency situation the timelines for preclinical and clinical development may be shortened, the question remains whether there will be any need for these products at the time they are ready for the market. More specifically, in spite of the fortunate capability to propagate the SARS-CoV on a well-accepted cell substrate (VERO), the development of a vaccine against the pathogen is severely impeded by the current fragmentary information on viral pathogenicity and the lack of adequate animal models of persistent infection and correlates of protection in humans. The origin of SARS-CoV is still unclear but animals in close contact to humans are a likely source. In that sense, SARS-CoV is possibly not really a novel virus but rather a newly discovered one following its adaptation to a new host species, namely humans. Despite the potential of coronaviruses to mutate rapidly and to cross species barriers the known strains are generally species-specific and genetically stable. Aside from humans, coronaviruses have been found in other mammals (pig, cat, dog, cattle, mouse) and birds (chicken), causing a wide variety of diseases (respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatitis, immunopathology) depending on the species [4] . The pathogenic potential of coronaviruses varies from moderate to deadly and mutations occurring during the course of infection can dramatically alter the virulence, as documented for feline coronavirus (FeCV). Several veterinary vaccines against animal coronaviruses are on the market and the experience with these products provides useful information for the design of a SARS-CoV vaccine. For instance, a number of vaccines against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) are widely used in chicken farming. In cattle, bovine coronavirus (BCV) vaccines are administered to pregnant cows in order to protect new-born calves from severe diarrhea, presumably via maternal antibodies [5] . Cats are vaccinated via the mucosal route with a live-attenuated FeCV. On the other hand, pre-existing antibodies against FeCV in cats are not necessarily protective and can even aggravate the disease via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of the infection [6] .",

However, when considering the current regulatory, safety and cGMP requirements for vaccines, a whole-virus vaccine approach is associated with significant drawbacks, both for safety reasons (delicate balance between attenuation and immunogenicity; genetic stability, i.e., risk of vaccinecaused disease as observed for Sabin's oral polio vaccine and vaccinia-based smallpox vaccine) and for manufacturing issues (scaleup production at BL3 safety level).

Essential information, for example the genome sequencing, was rapidly generated and immediately made publicly available. The industry in general is certainly ready to rise to the challenge posed by SARS with regard to a vaccine, particularly as health authorities have urged it to invest a lot of effort in commercially high-risk fasttrack research programs. Indeed, despite the numerous hurdles waiting on the road, the threat of a globally emerging disease certainly justifies unconventional and high-risk (in terms of investment and outcome) approaches. However, due to the exceedingly high possibility of failure, appropriate incentives are urgently needed from major national and international organizations. Grants contributing to the early high-risk phase of the projects (feasibility studies up to clinical Phases I and II) may allow an increase in the number of approaches investigated and thereby maximize the overall chances of success. Undoubtedly, SARS will provide a number of valuable lessons for the management of future emerging diseases with pandemic potential.",
