No evidence of genetic reassortment between avian and human influenza viruses has been identified. If reassortment occurs, the likelihood that the H5N1 virus can be transmitted more readily from person to person will increase. Although all the genes are of avian origin, the current H5N1 viruses are antigenically distinguishable from those isolated from humans in Hong Kong in 1997 and 2003.",

CDC recommends that virus isolation studies on respiratory specimens from patients who meet the testing criteria should not be performed unless all BSL-3C conditions are met. However, clinical specimens can be tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays by using standard BSL-2 work practices in a Class II biological safety cabinet. CDC has developed real-time PCR protocols for various respiratory pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza A and B viruses. In addition, commercially available antigen-detection tests can be used under BSL-2 levels to test for influenza. Although these rapid tests for human influenza also can detect avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses, the sensitivity of these tests is substantially lower than that of virus culture or PCR. 2 Specimens from persons meeting clinical and epidemiologic indications for testing should be sent to CDC if they test positive for influenza A either by PCR or antigen detection testing, or if PCR assays for influenza are not available locally. CDC also will accept, for follow-up testing, specimens from persons meeting the clinical and epidemiologic indications but testing negative on the rapid tests when PCR assay was not available. Requests for testing by CDC should come through local and state health departments, which should contact CDC's Emergency Operations Center, telephone 770-488-7100.",

            "text": "Influenza is one of the costliest infectious diseases worldwide. Not only do yearly endemic outbreaks lead to significant local morbidity and mortality, but less frequent pandemicsd4 in the 20th century alonedcause death tolls in the millions. The ''Spanish flu'' of 1918 to 1919 resulted in 20 to 40 million deaths worldwide. 1 In the late 1990s, after several decades of fairly stable human influenza viruses, highly pathogenic avian influenza infected humans in Southeast Asia for the first time. In the setting of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and emerging human infections with these highly pathogenic avian influenza strains, the prospect of a pandemic looms large for public health authorities and should prompt preparative measures from emergency care providers.The ability of influenza to cause repeated outbreaks lies in its viral structure and ease of genetic reassortment. Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and contain singlestranded RNA. These enveloped viruses can be classified into A, B, and C types on the basis of their internal nucleoprotein and matrix protein identity. Only influenza A and B are associated with major outbreaks. 2 Influenza A is more diverse, associated with more outbreaks, and includes all avian influenza strains.Influenza A contains 8 distinct genes. Two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, account for its infectivity as well as trigger the host immune response. Hemagglutinin binds sialic acid receptors on the host cell membrane to gain access to the cell; this is the main target of antibodies and vaccines. Neuraminidase facilitates release of progeny virions from host cells after replication and is the target of antiviral therapies. These proteins are also used to identify different strains; to date, 15 hemagglutinin (H1-15) and 9 neuraminidases (N1-9) have been identified. Only 3 hemagglutinin (H1-3) and 2 neuraminidase (N1, N2) subtypes of influenza A persist in humans. Certain hemagglutinin and neuraminidases subtypes are associated with pigs (H1, H3, N1, N2) and horses (H7, N7, N8). All hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes are established in aquatic birds. 2, 3 The epidemiology of influenza is closely linked with the genetics of these 2 proteins. Local epidemics, like the severe ''flu season'' of 2003 to 2004 in the United States, are caused by antigenic drift. This means that random point mutations in the genetic sequence escape repair, leading to gradual ''drift'' of the gene pool. The genes coding for hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are inherently unstable and constantly undergoing genetic drift. People are more susceptible to these slightly altered strains but also retain some degree of crossimmunity from prior influenza exposures. Thus, resultant epidemics are limited in scope and severity.Antigenic shift is potentially far more dangerous. Shift occurs when 1 of the 8 genes is exchanged in its entirety for another during replication. This requires a host cell, called a ''mixing vessel,'' to be coinfected with 2 influenza strains. Pigs are an ideal mixing vessel because they are readily infected with both human and avian forms. 4, 5 Alternatively, a person infected with a conventional human influenza virus could be coinfected with a highly pathogenic avian influenza strain. Global influenza pandemics result from such antigenic shift because there is no pre-existing immunity to the new strain.Aquatic birds serve as the primary reservoir for influenza A, carrying the viruses largely without adverse effects. 4,6 Domestic poultry, however, are highly susceptible to avian influenza. Depending on the virulence of the particular strain, poultry may manifest mild upper respiratory infections or rapidly fatal illness. 4 Formerly known as ''fowl plague,'' highly pathogenic avian influenza is now identified as strains H5 and H7, which cause severe disease in terrestrial birds. 6, 7 Since the Hong Kong pandemic of 1968, the human strains of influenza A had remained fairly stable. 5 However, in the late 1990s, new avian strains began to infect humans in relatively small numbers. Eighteen people were infected with influenza A (H5N1) in Hong Kong in 1997; 6 died. 4, 8 In 1999, H9N2 was isolated for the first time from 2 children in Hong Kong, who both recovered after mild respiratory illnesses. 4, 8 Most concerning, however, is this year's re-emergence of influenza A (H5N1)dslightly different genetically than the 1997 strain. 9-11 Affecting poultry across Southeast Asia, this is the most widespread outbreak of avian influenza in history. More than 100 million poultry have died or been killed as a result. 12 As of September 28, 2004, in Thailand and Vietnam, 42 cases were reported in healthy young adults and children, with a 71% mortality rate. 13 The H5N1 strain of influenza transmitted to humans this year has 2 of the 3 classic features of a potential pandemic: high mortality and an immunologically naive population. 14 Lacking,",
