This is another reason to advise clients not to clean their pets' cages before an appointment, as the familiar smell of seasoned bedding will afford comfort to the rodent. Alternatively, the opportunity for a habituated rodent to nestle next to the familiar smell of its owner can only be afforded in a quiet and safe waiting area.",

Mice in particular are very sensitive to the effects of heat. Waiting areas as well as hospital cages for rodents should be kept relatively cool. An ideal ambient air temperature range is 68\u00b0F to 70\u00b0F (20\u00b0C-26\u00b0C). 14 Educating clients and receptionists about ways to make a trip to the hospital less stressful is well worth the time investment required.

Websites about rodents often provide incomplete or misleading information; we cannot recommend any of these at present. Veterinarians should be aware of the current popular books and websites, as clients often have questions based on browsing these sources. Knowledge of your clients' sources of information can further help you in judging their ability to provide an accurate history. Furthermore, pet owners report more confidence in information received from veterinarians compared with information from any other accessible source. 51 Do not become unsettled if an owner appears to know more than you do. Such a client can be very informative, enthusiastic, and willing to take an active role in treatment. In discussing a pet's problem with its owner, communicate on a level commensurate with his or her aptitude and background.

Have a dipstick ready to perform an immediate urinalysis or a syringe handy to aspirate urine off a clean surface for urinalysis; feces can be caught in a small tube and examined later if required. By this point in the examination, the condition of the fur and the body in general have been assessed. Palpate the limbs for tenderness or fractures and pay special attention to the paws, noting the length of the nails and the state of the footpads. Rodents are fastidious groomers and therefore can groom away evidence of underlying disease/ illness easily. Observe the medial aspect of the front legs for crusts, debris, alopecia, or porphyrin staining, which may occur from excessive grooming associated with nasal discharge.

Blood sampling in conscious rodents induces increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature, which may last up to 30 hours; therefore we often sedate or anesthetize patients to obtain samples. 29 Low-dose acepromazine (0.5 mg/kg IM) administration results in peripheral vasodilation, making peripheral venipuncture easier. While some authors advise against using acepromazine in gerbils because it may induce seizures, there is no evidence of a proconvulsive effect in gerbils. Furthermore, clinicians reevaluating acepromazine administration and recurrence of seizure activity in epileptic dogs found no correlation. 66 Technologic advances have made possible electrocardiography and accurate and sensitive recordings of heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure in research rodents. 53 The cost of the equipment for performing these measurements and the invasive procedures that are often necessary for achieving the recordings prohibit routine use of these testing modalities in most veterinary practices. However, advances in high-resolution digital radiography that require relatively low radiographic exposures, developments in ultrasound, and the availability of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have allowed diagnostic imaging to become a useful ancillary examination. 84 ",

Although this may seem rather obvious, much of the literature describing the maladies of pet rodents has been inferred indiscriminately from conditions seen in laboratory rodents. The diagnosis and treatment of pet rodents involves evaluation and care of an individual animal from a household, not the health management of rodents from a research colony. Derangements likely to be seen in practice include trauma-induced injuries, infectious and parasitic diseases, neoplasia, and problems related to nutrition and aging; genetic disorders are uncommon. Dermatologic conditions make up 25% of the cases in exotic pets presented for small-animal consultations in general practice in the United Kingdom. 42 Natural infections that would be considered rare in a laboratory animal colony often are transmitted to pet rodents by other household animals and children; for example, cats and dogs are major reservoirs of dermatophytes, 24 and humans are the natural host of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, which are now often antibiotic-resistant. 2 Rodents used for research are maintained in tightly controlled environments designed to reduce the impact of unwanted variables in animal experiments. 14 However, pet rodents are generally exposed to temperature, humidity, and light-cycle changes; a broad range of foods; numerous microorganisms borne by animals and humans; and various types of handling. Rodents obtained from pet stores have had to endure the stress of overcrowding, transport, and on occasion temperature extremes, all of which put them at risk for disease. As a result, pet rodents exhibit a wider range of physiologic and pathologic responses than do rodents used for research.

As prey animals, rodents do not show obvious signs of pain or disease until they are near death. Consequently, sick rodents are often presented late in disease progression compared with earlier presentation in cats and dogs. We have found that indicators of death are a form of shock indicated by lethargy, decreased heart and respiratory rates, and a rapid drop in body temperature to below 91\u00b0F (33\u00b0C). In rodent aging studies, pronounced bradycardia (30% lower than normal) and hypothermia (13% lower than normal) are significant predictors of death 5 to 6 weeks before expiration. 101 Treat this type of shock by warming the patient to restore normal temperature, infusing crystalloid fluids, and providing oxygen therapy.

Disease prevention is primarily based on commonsense husbandry practices, such as purchasing healthy, genetically sound animals; supplying balanced fresh food appropriate in protein and caloric content; avoiding obesity; providing clean fresh water; furnishing adequate shelter, including shade from direct sunlight; avoiding drafts and extreme changes in temperature or humidity; keeping cages clean by preventing the accumulation of excess feces and urine; isolating sick animals from a group for treatment; and protecting vulnerable animals from more aggressive members of their group (e.g., young animals from older animals and male hamsters from female hamsters) or from natural predators living in the same household (e.g., mice from cats). Other sound husbandry practices include housing different species separately to prevent interspecies disease transmission (e.g., rats carry Streptobacillus moniliformis, a cause of septicemia in mice, in their nasopharyngeal cavities) and reducing obesity by limiting food intake and providing cage accessories (e.g., exercise wheels, tunnels, and ramps) that allow play and exploration. Companies selling environmental enrichment equipment and accessories for rodents include Otto Environmental (Milwaukee, WI; www.ottoenvironmental.com) and Bio-Serv (Frenchtown, NJ; www.bio-serv.com).",

A survey from a large diagnostic laboratory housing research animals indicated that skin disease in mice represents 25% of all diagnostic problem-solving cases (for all species) submitted. 55 We categorize four groups of skin problems in mice: behavioral disorders, husbandry-related problems, microbiologic and parasitic infections, and idiopathic conditions. Behavioral, husbandry, and infectious causes of skin disease are relatively straightforward to diagnose and treat. However, many skin diseases characterized by chronic or ulcerated skin (often secondarily colonized by bacteria) are diagnosed as idiopathic. This group is commonly unresponsive to topical or systemic treatment, and affected individuals are often euthanatized. Most damage to the skin is done by toenails as the rodent scratches itself. It is difficult to prevent a rodent from scratching. The nails can be trimmed or filed to remove sharp ends, but attempts to fit the rodent with a bandage or protective wrap are often pointless, as these animals are adept at removing all bandages. Restraint collars can be used, but rodents are not able to eat easily with a collar in place and it will not be effective unless the underlying cause is detected and treated simultaneously.",

            "text": "Mice exhibit well-studied social and sexual behaviors. Social dominance, a form of behavior relating to the social rank and dominance status of an individual mouse in a group, is manifested as barbering and fighting. Barbering is commonly a condition seen in group-housed mice, where the dominant mouse nibbles off the whiskers and hair around the muzzles and eyes of cage mates. No other lesions are present, and only one mouse (the dominant one) retains all of its fur. Removal of the dominant mouse stops barbering; frequently, however, another mouse then assumes the dominant role. Barbering occurs during acts of mutual grooming in which one member of a mouse pair grasps individual whiskers or hairs with its incisors and plucks them out. Although plucking appears painful, recipients are passive in accepting barbering and even pursue conspecifics for further grooming. 85 Barbering may also be seen associated with sexual overgrooming as a form of stress-evoked behavior, and lactating mice may display \"maternal\" barbering, produced in the process of suckling pups, in which alopecia is seen from tail to chin. 47 Although rare in mice, consider infection with Trichophyton mentagrophytes in cases of alopecia that involve face, head, neck, or tail in all or just a few mice. 22 Barbering has a genetic-based behavioral background, as aggressive inbred strains of mice do not use barbering in their behavior. 47 In pet mice, barbering is often seen in female mice caged together. Male mice except littermates raised together from birth are more likely to fight, often very savagely, and inflict severe bite wounds on one another, especially over the rump, tail, and shoulders.",

Unlike barbering, dermatitis may also be associated with the alopecic area. Treatment consists of replacing the poorly constructed equipment with nonabrading equipment. Individually housed mice can display aberrant stereotypic behaviors such as polydipsia and bar chewing, which result in mechanical abrasion and alopecia. In these cases, environmental enrichment must be Most infectious causes of alopecia and dermatitis are associated with fur mites.

The coat often has a greasy appearance; in cases of heavy infestation, noticeable pruritus and self-inflicted dermal ulceration may occur. Three mites are commonly seen: Myobia musculi, Myocoptes musculinus, and Radfordia affinis. The most clinically significant mouse mite is M. musculi. Infestations are usually caused by more than one species. Mites are spread by direct contact with infected mice or infested bedding. Diagnosis is based on the identifying adult mites, nymphs, or eggs on hair shafts with the use of a hand lens or a stereoscopic microscope. Adults and nymphs appear pearly white and elongated (being about twice as long as they are wide); eggs are oval and seen attached to the base of hairs or inside mature females.",

Idiopathic ulcerative dermatitis is a well-recognized disease in black laboratory mice on a C57BL strain background with a characteristic distribution on the thorax and head. The cause is an underlying vasculitis attributed to immune complex deposition on dermal vessels. 48 Dietary factors and dysregulated fatty acid metabolism have been implicated in the development of the disease and the severity appears to be modulated by dietary fat and vitamin E content. Gavaging affected mice with 0.1 mL per day of liquid from an essential fatty acid supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids was associated with regressed lesions and resolved pruritus in a small sample of affected mice. 60 We have obtained good treatment results using a generic omega-3 fatty acid supplement at 0.1 to 0.2 mL PO q24h. The ulcers may heal with fibrosis and resulting skin contracture or progress to a Staphylococcus xylosus secondary bacterial infection. 48, 100 Progressive necrosing dermatitis of the pinna in mice, similar to idiopathic ulcerative dermatitis, may also be seen ( Fig.  27-1 ). 94 It occurs in outbred mice, and there is no strain background association.

Several days later the necrotic area sloughs and the pinna is left notched.

Mycoplasma pulmonis is the cause of chronic pneumonia, suppurative rhinitis, and occasionally otitis media. Chattering and dyspnea are caused by accumulations of purulent exudate in inflamed and thickened nasal passages.

            "text": "Integumentary System. Ectoparasitic infestation is more common in rats than in mice. Occasionally the fur mite Radfordia ensifera is seen. Although R. ensifera infestation produces few ill effects, heavy infestation may lead to self-traumatization and ulcerative dermatitis. Other mites, including Demodex species, have been described in rats maintained in laboratories; however, they are seldom seen, and no contemporary reports of infestations in pet rats appear in the literature. 107 The tropical rat mite Ornithonyssus bacoti is an opportunistic ectoparasite often found on pet rats, mice, gerbils, and hamsters ( Fig. 27-2 ). It spends a relatively short time on a host and penetrates the skin for feeding only. Severe infestations can cause anemia, debilitation, and death in rodents. When an animal host is not available, humans can become the victims of mite infestation. Locating the resident host of the mite is critical in its successful elimination. Detect adult parasites by macroscopic examination of the host; the mites are orange red. Rats with ectoparasites can be treated with selamectin (15 mg/kg as topical spot on, repeat in 10 days). The environment can be decontaminated with either synthetic pyrethroids or fipronil (see Table 27 -2). 6 Ringtail is a pathologic condition of the tail of young rats that is typically characterized by dry skin and the formation of annular constrictions. In severe cases, blood vessels distal to the constrictions thrombose, resulting in pain and necrotic tissue. Autoamputation may result. This lesion is highly photogenic and probably for this reason is always described in textbooks and articles on diseases of rats. It occurs primarily during the preweaning period in rats aged 2 to 19 days and occasionally in young mice. Low environmental relative humidity (less than 40%) appears to be the cause, and it is more often seen in rats housed in hanging cages; it is rarely seen in pet rats. If ringtail is diagnosed, treatment options involve adding unsaturated fatty acids to the diet (e.g., 5% corn oil or an essential fatty acid supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids) or topical application of lanolin. 32, 102 If avascular necrosis has occurred, amputate the tail below the necrotic annular constriction.",

The major component of CRD is M. pulmonis, and the disease is also known as murine respiratory mycoplasmosis (MRM). Rats may live 2 to 3 years with CRD. While M. pulmonis is rarely seen in laboratory rats, serologic test results of pet rats are usually positive. A survey of 28 pet ratteries in the United States found that all were positive for M. pulmonis. 17 Clinical signs are highly variable: in many cases no signs are present even though significant pulmonary lesions may exist. The prevalence and severity of signs typically increase with the age of the rat and the presence of environmental stresses placed upon the animal. Initial infection commonly occurs without any clinical signs; early signs involve both the upper and the lower respiratory tracts and may include snuffling, nasal discharge, polypnea, weight loss, hunched posture, ruffled coat, head tilt, and red tears. 110 The most important aspect of CRD for clinicians is that respiratory mycoplasmosis varies greatly in disease expression because of environmental, host, and organismal factors that influence the host-pathogen relationship. Examples of such factors include intracage ammonia levels, concurrent Sendai virus, coronavirus (sialodacryoadenitis virus), PVM, rat respiratory virus and/or CAR bacillus infection, the genetic susceptibility of the host, the virulence of the Mycoplasma strain, and vitamin A or E deficiency. 110 Auscultation is insensitive in determining the severity of respiratory disease, and radiographs are often unremarkable. However, CT scan often reveals significant pulmonary disease. Serology is the preferred choice for diagnostic testing, as Mycoplasma is difficult to grow in a laboratory. Younger rats naturally exposed to M. pulmonis may be seronegative for up to 4 months postexposure. 21 The primary lesion of CRD is subacute and chronic bronchitis (SACB), a chronic inflammatory condition resulting in respiratory epithelial dysfunction. 50 The underlying airway inflammation and clinical signs result from damage and remodeling of airway epithelium, colonization of the airways with secondary infections, and infiltration and activation of neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes. Bronchodilators are the primary treatment for SACB. Inhaled nonselective muscarinic antagonists (e.g., ipratropium bromide) and beta-2 adrenergic agonists (e.g., albuterol, salmeterol) as well as oral theophylline provide significant although modest efficacy. Frequent treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is necessary, as microbe colonization is a common finding. Tetracycline antibiotics like doxycycline are efficacious in CRD. Treating with doxycycline (5-10 mg/kg PO q12h) or a long-acting depot such as doxycycline (Vibravenos, Pfizer Animal Health, www.Pfizer.com), 70-100 mg/kg SC or IM q7d) often helps affected rats.",

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration can be estimated with the use of a blood dipstick, and proteinuria can be detected on urine dipstick analysis. Chronic progressive nephrosis (CPN) is the best known age-related disease in rats. In CPN, the kidneys are enlarged and pale and have a pitted, mottled surface that often contains pinpoint cysts. Lesions consist of a progressive glomerulosclerosis and myriad tubulointerstitial disease primarily involving the convoluted proximal tubule. 36 The most striking change in renal function is proteinuria exceeding 10 mg/ day that increases in severity progressively with age. The features of CPN are qualitatively similar among different strains of laboratory rats, but the onset, incidence, and severity of the disease vary considerably. The disease occurs earlier and is of greater severity in males than in females: urinary protein excretion averaging 137 mg/day has been documented in 18-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats, whereas excretion averaging 76 mg/day was reported in female rats of the same age. 91 Dietary factors appear to have an important role in the progression of CPN. Caloric restriction, the feeding of low-protein diets (4%-7%), and limiting the source of dietary protein reduce the incidence and severity of CPN. Feeding soybean protein (as opposed to casein) and caloric restriction contribute substantially to reducing the incidence and severity of CPN; low-calorie diets that contain high protein levels do not decrease the incidence or severity. Drugs and exposure to chemicals can also exacerbate CPN. Treatment is supportive and involves feeding a low-protein diet and administering anabolic steroids.",

Distinguishing between age-related peripheral or central nervous system changes, neurogenic muscular atrophy, and primary age changes in muscles is very difficult. Posterior paresis is commonly caused by spinal nerve root degeneration (also known as radiculoneuropathy, polyradiculoneuropathy, and degenerative myelopathy). 112 Spontaneous tumors of the peripheral nervous system in rats are very rare; only isolated cases are reported in extensive tumor incidence surveys. 1 Allowing young rats to stand on their hind legs frequently is a predisposing factor in the development of avascular necrosis of the femoral head (Legg-Calve-Perthes disease). 68 Ocular System. The harderian glands of rats are located behind the eyes. These glands secrete various porphyrins that give the tears a reddish color. Harderian gland secretion increases in response to stress and disease, and the tears themselves dry around the eyes and external nares (the nasolacrimal duct drains into the nasal cavity), resembling crusts of blood ( Fig. 27-6 ). Owners commonly report bleeding from the eyes and noses of their pet rats. The porphyrins fluoresce under ultraviolet light and can be readily differentiated from blood with a Wood's lamp (Fig. 27-7) . This condition is known as chromodacryorrhea, or red tears; although it is not pathologic, it is a consequence of an acute onset stress such as that caused by pain, illness, or restraint. 19 Red tears are often an indication of a chronic underlying disease, and their presence warrants a thorough evaluation of the affected animal.",

Although two other species of hamsters, the common or European hamster (Cricetus cricetus) and the rat-like Chinese hamster (Cricetulus griseus) are used in research, they do not make good pets because of their aggressive nature. However, dwarf hamsters such as the Djungarian (Phodopus sungorus) and Roborovsky's (Phodopus roborovskii) are being seen increasingly as pets because they have a docile disposition, do not attempt to bite or run away, and do well in captivity. There is some confusion over the common names of the species of Phodopus. Until about 1980, P. sungorus was considered to have two subspecies-P. sungorus sungorus and P. sungorus campbelli. Phodopus sungorus sungorus was known as the Djungarian hamster. There was no commonly used name for P. sungorus campbelli. Then studies showed that these two subspecies were in fact different species, and they were renamed as P. sungorus and P. campbelli. The name \"Siberian hamster\" was applied to P. sungorus and \"Djungarian hamster\" to P. campbelli.",

Diarrhea may occur in hamsters of any age and is known as \"wet-tail,\" although this euphemism is frequently used to describe the disease in young hamsters. Proliferative ileitis is the most significant intestinal disease of 3-to 10-week-old hamsters and results in high mortality. It is caused by the intracellular bacterium Lawsonia intracellularis, which is also responsible for proliferative enteropathy in pigs and ferrets. 59 Treatment must be aggressive and involves correcting life-threatening electrolyte imbalance, administering antibiotics, and force-feeding. Several antibiotic treatments are recommended, including tetracycline-hydrochloride (400 mg/L of drinking water for 10 days), tetracycline (10 mg/kg PO q12h for 5-7 days), enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg PO or IM q12h for 5-7 days), and trimethoprim-sulfa combination (30 mg/kg PO q12h for 5-7 days). Symptomatic treatment with bismuth subsalicylate may be given if diarrhea persists. Replacement electrolyte and glucose solutions should be given orally, and electrolyte fluid replacement such as saline or LRS should be given at a dose 20 mL/100 g q24h. Diagnosis often depends on necropsy and histologic examination, although fecal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have been developed. 75 Sequelae to proliferative ileitis in surviving hamsters may include eventual obstruction, intussusception, or rectal prolapse (Fig. 27-8 ) (see Chapter 28) . 15 Diarrhea in adult hamsters is associated with Clostridium difficile enterotoxemia and may occur 3 to 5 days after the administration of antibiotics such as penicillin, lincomycin, or bacitracin. 39 Detection of C. difficile by PCR is highly sensitive and can discriminate between toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains of the organism by detecting its toxin-producing genes. Oral administration of bovine antibodies against toxigenic C. difficile has been shown to protect hamsters against experimental antibiotic-associated enterotoxemia. 63 Tyzzer disease caused by Clostridium piliforme has been described in hamsters and gerbils obtained from a pet store supplier. 69 The supplier's hamsters and gerbils had a high mortality rate but the rats and mice did not. Affected rodents were depressed, dehydrated, and had scruffy coats and diarrhea; many animals had no clinical signs before death. Clinical outbreaks appear to be precipitated by severe stress, including that caused by overcrowding, high environmental temperature and humidity, heavy internal and external parasite load, and nutritionally inadequate diets despite the prophylactic treatment of drinking water with oxytetracycline. Tyzzer disease is frequently listed as an intestinal disease of rodents and other animals in laboratory animal textbooks. However, the actual prevalence of the infection in contemporary rodents remains unknown. The report concerning the pet store illustrates the opportunistic nature of C. piliforme in immunosuppressed animals. The disease is not seen in healthy immunocompetent animals.",

            "text": "Although the incidence does not differ between the sexes near the end of their respective life spans, atrial thrombosis occurs on average at a younger age in females (13.5 months) than in males (21.5 months). 109 Aged pet hamsters present with clinical signs of cardiomyopathy such as hyperpnea, tachycardia, and cyanosis. In untreated hamsters, death usually follows within a week after these signs become evident. The incidence of atrial thrombosis is influenced by the endocrine status of the animal and especially by the amount of circulating androgen. Thus, castrating male hamsters is linked to an increase in the prevalence of atrial thrombosis. 92 Cardiomyopathy should be suspected in aged pet hamsters (older than 1.5 years) that present clinically with signs of tachypnea, lethargy, anorexia, and cold extremities. 88 Diagnosis of cardiomyopathy in hamsters is based on clinical signs and results of radiography and ultrasound examination of the heart. Treatment of heart disease is symptomatic and involves empiric use of digoxin, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and prophylactic anticoagulants. We base dosages of these drugs on ferret doses and monitor response closely. Verapamil, a calcium antagonist, administered at a dose increasing from 0.25 mg to 0.50 mg given SC q8h over 4 weeks, prevented severe myocardial lesions in untreated 2-month-old inbred female myopathic hamsters. 57 Endocrine System. Surveys of spontaneous lesions in laboratory hamsters describe a high incidence of adrenocortical hyperplasia and adenoma. 87 However, despite extensive histopathologic study, hyperadrenocorticism or Cushing's disease has been reported in only four hamsters, with high serum cortisol concentrations documented in only one of the four. 5, 64 Hamsters with clinical signs resembling those of Cushing's disease are occasionally seen in practice. Diagnosis is based on identifying classic signs similar to those seen in dogs, such as a history of polydipsia, polyuria, and polyphagia; clinical signs of alopecia and hyperpigmentation; and high concentrations of plasma cortisol and serum alkaline phosphatase. Normal hamster cortisol concentrations are low compared with those of other species and range from 0.5 to 1.0 mcg/dL in normal males and females. 108 Research has suggested that hamsters may secrete both cortisol and corticosterone. 72 Therefore meaningful measurement of plasma cortisol concentrations in hamsters is empiric at present. If hyperadrenocorticism is suspected, the cause-such as hypersecretion by a functional tumor, primary adrenal hyperplasia, or excess adrenocorticotropic hormone production-is often more difficult to determine. Hamsters respond to exogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation. 108 The treatment of hamsters described in the clinical reports indicated that ketoconazole (5 mg/kg q12h for 1 month) did not work, o,p'-DDD, now known as mitotane (5 mg PO q24h for 1 month) did not work, and metyrapone (8 mg PO q24h for 1 month) worked in one of two hamsters. Further research needs to be done on this syndrome. Ocular System. Exophthalmos is commonly seen in hamsters and usually occurs because of ocular infection or trauma to the periorbital area or the application of excess pressure in holding the animal during restraint. Hamsters with sialodacryoadenitis may develop keratoconjunctivitis sicca and exophthalmos and subsequent proptosis. Occasionally, a hamster's eye is displaced forward if the caregiver restrains the animal too tightly by holding the skin at the back of the neck. If the hamster is treated soon after the exophthalmos occurs, the prognosis for saving the eye is good. Cleanse the ocular area gently with an ophthalmic wash and lubricate the eye with sterile ophthalmic lubricant. Gently retract the lid margins around the globe until the eye returns to its normal position. Treat the eye with an antibiotic ophthalmic ointment for a minimum of 7 to 10 days. Occasionally, tarsorrhaphy will be needed to prevent recurrence. Enucleation may be necessary if the eye cannot be replaced or if significant trauma to the proptosed eye has occurred.",

In older hamsters, lymphoma is the most frequently observed neoplasm of the hematopoietic system. 99 These tumors are often multicentric, involving the thymus, thoracic lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph nodes, superficial lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and other sites. Cytology of the tumors is variable. A second variation, cutaneous lymphoma, is seen in adult hamsters and resembles mycosis fungoides, an epidermotropic T-cell lymphoma in humans. 40 Clinicians have described lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, patchy alopecia, and exfoliative erythroderma in affected animals. Pathologists have observed dense infiltrates of neoplastic lymphocytes in the dermis with extension into the epidermis. The third variation is an epizootic lymphoma in young hamsters caused by hamster polyomavirus (HaPV). 4 When HaPV is first introduced into a naive population of breeding hamsters, it can result in epizootics of lymphoma, with an incidence as high as 80% among animals. Once enzootic in a hamster population, the occurrence of lymphoma declines to a much lower level. Enzootically infected hamsters develop HaPV skin tumors rather than lymphoma. Hamsters with HaPV lymphoma appear thin, often with palpable masses in their abdomens. Tumors associated with HaPV often arise in the mesentery but can also arise in the axillary and cervical lymph nodes. The tumors are often lymphoid, but erythroblastic, reticulosarcomatous, and myeloid types occur.",

Clinical lesions adjacent to the external nares appear erythematous initially; these lesions progress to localized alopecia and then to an extensive moist dermatitis ( Fig. 27-12) . The cause is believed to be an increase in the secretion of porphyrins by the Harderian gland (as in chromodacryorrhea in rats), which acts as a primary skin irritant. 20 Various staphylococcal species (S. aureus and S. xylosus) may act synergistically to produce the dermatitis. 95 Stress may cause excessive harderian gland secretion. Two examples of stress are overcrowding and exposure to an environmental humidity of greater than 50%, which causes the fur coat to stand out and appear matted. Gerbils require sand baths to keep their coats from becoming oily. Keeping the gerbil in a dry environment, cleaning its face, and providing soft clay or sand bedding instead of abrasive wood chip bedding will usually alleviate the problem.

The likely cause is the refusal of pet degus to eat an optimal amount of hay, instead consuming commercial feeds containing alfalfa, cornflakes, maize, grain mixture, nuts, raisins, and other sweets. Such diets have less abrasive properties, resulting in reduced chewing duration owing to high dietary energy content and lower coarse fiber content. 113 The lack of tooth wear likely results in continuous eruption and abnormal coronal and apical elongation of the incisor and cheek teeth. In early dental disease, the mandibular cheek teeth elongate apically with palpable prominences on ventral mandibular surface.
