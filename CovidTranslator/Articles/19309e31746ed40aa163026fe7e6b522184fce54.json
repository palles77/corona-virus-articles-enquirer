The model simulates the intensity and center of disease outbreaks in cities and towns, and provides a more complete simulation of the disease spatiotemporal process than other models. The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 represented one of the most serious public health challenges to China and elsewhere in the world. Although outbreaks of influenza A (H1N1) have subsided, many researchers have studied pandemic (H1N1) 2009 from a wide array of perspectives [1] [2] [3] [4] . However, based on our literature review, only a handful of studies have touched upon influenza A (H1N1) transmission between cities and towns, and the diffusion effect of the road traffic system. Influenza A (H1N1) is a human-to-human transmission disease, which infects people by direct body contact or res-piratory droplets. Therefore, the virus is easily transmitted through large-scale population movements. The initial stage of the pandemic in China involved the spread of imported cases and then, mainly through secondary cases, the pandemic spread from metropolitan areas to small cities and from eastern to western areas [5] . With the acceleration of urbanization, close contact is more frequent in cities and towns, population movement between urban and rural areas has increased gradually in frequency and speed, and medical and health services are weak in the villages and towns, which indicated that human-to-human transmission through the road traffic system could result in a pandemic in China. Since the 2003 global Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) crisis, many scientists around the world gradually became aware of the important role of transportation systems in infectious disease transmission. Olsen et al. [6] found that transmission of SARS may occur on an aircraft when infected individuals fly during the symptomatic phase of illness. Fang et al. [7] studied the spatial and temporal characteristics of the SARS epidemic in mainland China and confirmed that SARS had benefited from national highways and interprovincial freeways for its spread from epicenters to neighboring areas. In addition, Fang and Cao conducted a epidemiological analysis of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus of the H5N1 subtype and indicated that national highways are one of the most important predictive environmental variables for risk of HPAI infection [8, 9] . To estimate ongoing H1N1 transmission via global airline transportation, Khan et al. [10] and Chang et al. [11] compared spatial diffusion of known H1N1 cases and air flight patterns to analyze risks related to air travel accessibility and confirmed that the worldwide airline network is the main vehicle for transmission.",

In 2008, 26821.14 million passengers were conveyed by road traffic [13] , which is 100 times more than air passengers. Furthermore, our study focused on influenza A (H1N1) transmission by road traffic between cities and towns because of both data availability as well as its impact and importance. The data used in this paper were extracted from an epidemiological survey of H1N1 infection cases reported to the surveillance systems at the Changsha Centers for Diseases Prevention and Control. Using this data set, we explored the transmission potential of road traffic systems and analyzed the transmission patterns and risk factors. We then established a model to simulate disease spread along the traffic routes and discuss inherent influenza A (H1N1) transmission mechanisms derived from our spatiotemporal data analysis.",

Among the 5439 cases of infection, 3215 (59%) were male patients and 2224 (41%) were female; the difference in male and female patient numbers was statistically significant (\u03c7 2 =129.07, P < 0.01).

Figure 1 shows daily counts of new influenza A (H1N1) cases during the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in Changsha. The plot shows four clear stages: sporadic occurrences in Changsha from May 22 to September 2, slowly increasing during the early stage of the outbreak from September 2 to October 24, sharply increasing from October 25 and rapidly declining from November 26.

From Figure 2 , it can be seen that H1N1 cases were clustered in municipal districts and county towns. Outbreaks in local areas generated many cases and high incidence rates, and the incidence rates along roadways were obviously higher than in other areas. The results indicated that a mass of settlements along the road system exhibited a high risk of infection. On the other hand, the large-scale population movement played a key role in disease transmission, and in addition, areas where roads intersect were high risk. For instance, the cities where a national highway and provincial road intersect, and the towns where provincial and county roads intersect, usually showed a high incidence rate. Our research also indicated that the spatial distribution of population density in Changsha fitted the Clark model well.

Vehicles are an ideal environment for close contact and increase cases exponentially. As a result of the short incubation period, influenza A (H1N1) is easily spread through the road traffic system. Figure 1 shows the four stages of the pandemic: initial period (May 22 to September 2), rapid development period (September 24 to October 24), peak period (October 25 to November 25) and declining period (November 26 to December 30). The five districts, 30 villages and 84 towns in the Changsha area were chosen as spatial analysis units. We extracted the following five factors for each of the units from the data set using spatial analysis techniques at different stages of the pandemic by logistic regression: intersection by a national highway, provincial road, county road, expressway or intercity bus station. The results indicated that the virus benefited from the opportunities for rapid spread along expressways and at intercity bus stations in the rapid development period. During the peak period, county roads played a key role in further spread of the disease towards the villages and towns. In addition, the intercity bus station was a risk factor that had a significant effect on disease diffusion over the whole pandemic period, as a result of its role as a transport hub.",

Inter-city bus stations were important in epidemic diffusion. Areas of road intersections had a high risk of infection, and the disease spread along roads and outwards away from roads. In addition, roads had different effects on epidemic diffusion in different stages. Because of the huge population, explosion of rural-to-urban migration, and the weak rural health and medical institutions, control of the outbreak of an unexpected infectious disease between cities and towns in a short time is difficult in China. The results indicate that the priority to reduce the impact of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 or similar diseases should be to control intercity bus stations and, furthermore, to prevent further spread of the disease in the areas intersected by national highways, provincial roads or county roads. Using GIS, we not only analyzed the spatiotemporal features of the epidemic, but also evaluated the risk factors in epidemic diffusion, to supplement and improve the descriptive epidemiology of the epidemic. We proposed a SIR model combining diffusion velocity and floating population size to determine the spatiotemporal synchronization and integrate forecasts of epidemic intensity and trends. Furthermore, it is of importance to explore the risk factors in H1N1 transmission through road traffic and its diffusion velocity.",

The infection rate was higher in schools, but schools differ from the research units used, which therefore reduced the accuracy of the simulated results; (ii) the monthly spatial distribution map shows intuitively that the risk of H1N1 infection in eastern areas was higher than that in western areas, and the epicenter moved eastward from the epicenter. Thus the transmission showed spatial trends and directivity; and (iii) as a result of hostpathogen-environment interactions, infectious diseases usually spread in a particular sequence according to specific factors. For instance, an epidemic usually spreads from a developed region to an under-developed region, from a densely populated area to a sparsely populated area, from an outbreak in a school to the surrounding settlement, or reemerges in a hospital.
