Continuing losses need to be replaced at the time that they occur. Use Normosol with at least 20 mEqlL of potassium chloride supplementation. Monitor glucose level. If necessary, add 2.5-5% dextrose to intravenous fluids. A 5% dextrose solution creates an osmotic diuresis, but it also allows assessment of progress in dealing with a septic case (glucose increases when the animal receives 5% dextrose if the sepsis is resolving).
