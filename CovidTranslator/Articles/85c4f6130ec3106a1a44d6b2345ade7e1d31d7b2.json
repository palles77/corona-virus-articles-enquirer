They are no longer considered as \"Acts of God\" but caused either by natural hazards or by human actions. This shift in thinking has led to different ways of dealing with disasters. What is becoming apparent is that more and more disasters are being produced by human actions. We cause them but seem unable to find the political will to stop doing so. Further, the role of humanitarian agencies has changed. At one time bodies such as the Red Cross would be associated with helping the injured in the battlefield. The nature of present-day warfare or complex emergencies and terrorism means that humanitarian bodies are dealing with many vulnerable refugees and internally displaced people. The following polemic reflects on these changes.",

First, the immediate threat exists from increasingly severe weather events and second, the long-term threat to global ecosystems occurs as the planet warms. The international community has recognized this threat and through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has tried to develop solutions. Progress, however, has been agonizingly slow. Initially the main thrust of the work of the Convention was to deal with the long-term threat by focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the vehicle devised to reduce emission rates, the Kyoto Protocol, has failed due, in part, to its architecture and effective campaigning and lobbying by climate skeptics funded through the energy sector. It is hoped that a new agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will be ready for implementation in 2020. Whether the negotiators can really address the scale of change needed in the global energy system is an open question (O'Keefe et al., 2010) . In the meantime, we are emitting our way into an unknown future. No indication exists as to what greenhouse gas concentration and what timetable will be agreed upon. Little chance seems to exist of us keeping the average global temperature rise below 2 C. We are producing a dangerous and unknown future.",

Adjusting to consequences, or adaptation, was thought only to be an issue for the Less Economically Developed Countries, such as Small Island Developing States. However, the litany of extreme weather events across the globe has rapidly raised adaptation up the agenda. A recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2014) paints a very bleak picture of what the world we are creating could look like: increased floods and droughts and more severe weather events that will threaten food security. Adaptation is now an issue for all nations. The problem is that if we do exceed the 2 C temperature rise, then we enter an era that is termed dangerous climate change. Stay below that temperature rise and we should be able to adapt. Go above that temperature, and we could be exposed to irreversible changes and the collapse of ecosystems to which we would be unable to adapt .",

            "text": "In short, we need to move to a low-carbon energy economy as soon as possible in order to avoid a future catastrophe. In the interim, we need to use our ingenuity to adapt to the consequences. The UNFCCC has been in place for some 30 years. To date, little real progress has been made and this does not augur well for the negotiations up to 2020. Reducing greenhouse gas emission appears, on the face of it, relatively straightforward. Much of the technology needed to both use energy efficiently and produce it cleanly is available. The problem lies in the lack of political will to opt for solutions rather than being market based. In many cases, we are \"locked into\" a number of technologies, for example, the United States seems to have opted strongly for fracking. Though gas is cleaner than coal, the investment decisions made today are likely to be in place for 40e50 years. We are getting to grips with renewable technologies and their use, in the main, of lowdensity, variable primary energy sources, such as wind and solar. But a gargantuan effort on production and deployment will be needed in order to produce significant energy from renewable resources (O'Keefe et al., 2010) . Ultimately, it is up to our political leaders to agree to a stabilization target and timetable. Energy planners can then get to work on planning the replacement of high carbon-emitting technologies with low ones. This may mean scrapping some systems before their due date. We must be brave enough to do that! Adapting to the changes locked into the climate system is also a massive challenge. But, as Stern (2007) pointed out, it is more cost-effective to address the problems now rather than deal with the consequences in the future. Progress on adaptation is being made and despite the huge uncertainties it is possible that we can develop sustainable approaches to this multifaceted challenge . Recognition has been occurring between the climate and disaster management communities of the overlap of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation techniques. This does raise the question of whether or not we have the right institutional arrangements. Adaptation is about people and their livelihoods and protecting them from climate risks. This is the role of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Reducing risk is the role of the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction. Promoting ecological well-being is the role of the United Nations Environment Programme. We could frame all of this with a Convention on Climate Adaptation that could still be linked with the IPCC. We could then streamline the institutional structures and have lines directly to the national, subnational, and local levels. This new body would have sovereign institutional responsibility for developing adaptation within a framework of human and ecological wellbeing .",

The UNFCCC has agreed a Green Climate Fund that will have funding of US$ 100 billion per year from 2020 for both mitigation and adaptation. But as O'Brien and O'Keefe (2014) have pointed out, the International Energy Agency estimate that moving to low-carbon energy could require some US$ 10.5 trillion by 2030 and that adaptation costs by various organizations such as the World Bank, UNFCCC, Oxfam, and UNDP range between US$50 billion and US$171 billion per year. The Green Climate Fund is unlikely to meet all needs. Many of the wealthier nations will need to dig deeper. Perhaps we could put some of the US$1.7 trillion per year we spend on the military to better use. All funding mechanisms involve privatizing the commons and commodifying the global atmospheric system through trading emission levels. Is that really the way to go?",

Humanitarian assistance includes local, national, and international efforts provided by individuals, communities, and national and international organizations addressing people in need where the prime motivation is to prevent and alleviate human suffering. The four fundamental principles underlying humanitarian interventions are humanity, impartiality, neutrality, and independence of the humanitarian actors (United Nations, 1991) . These principles are not usually observed in humanitarian interventions, not least in those tied to military intervention such as Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan. 1 Humanitarian aid addresses the needs of a population after natural disasters or complex emergencies. Natural disasters are dominated by meteorological phenomena (drought, flood, and hurricane) and, to a much lesser extent, geological ones (earthquakes, volcanoes, and tsunamis). Intervention in the aftermath of natural disaster is dwarfed by intervention in complex emergencies. Complex emergencies, characterized by high levels of civilian casualties, deliberate destruction of livelihoods, and the collapse of the rule of law, have increased the number of displaced people either as refugees or internally displaced people (IDP), particularly since the end of the Cold War (Middleton and O'Keefe, 1997) . The current crisis in Syria has generated 2.6 million refugees and 6.5 million IDP. In general, the humanitarian system was not designed to deal with such massive problems.",

The M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) family is an exception to this statement. Figure 3 .1 shows the broad routings on humanitarian monies. The important routes on the diagram are from donor governments to the UN system and iNGOs and from the UN system to iNGOs. Those routes command the most flow. What the affected population makes of all the players on the ground, frequently with different rules of engagement, remains largely unanswered. The iNGOs essentially form an oligopoly. This oligopoly is distinguished by its members signing \"Heads of Agreement\" with the major UN agencies, especially UN WFP, to act as distributors in UN programs of humanitarian aid. In addition, they form joint fund-raising appeals where membership is restricted, excluding smaller iNGOs. Perhaps the best example of this is the operation of the Disaster Emergency Committee (DEC) in the United Kingdom currently. The DEC brings 13 leading UK aid charities together in times of crisis: Action Aid, Age International, British Red Cross, Catholic Fund for Overseas Development (CAFOD), Care International, Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Islamic Relief, Oxfam, Plan UK, Save the Children, Tearfund, and World Vision. Most are global families, frequently headquartering those institutions in London or Washington. They are essentially businesses with high corporate remuneration and high rates of growth.",

It is the resilience of people that is an important factor in their ability to respond to disasters and contributes to them being first responders. We do not in any way decry the efforts made by emergency responders or humanitarian agencies but argue that they are mission focused and do not necessarily have the wider community well-being agenda in mind. Successful predisaster planning must focus on building both personal and community resilience and enhancing social capital. Reich (2006) discussed three social organizing principles for resilience to disasters. These are control, coherence, and connectedness. In the case of control, external help can create a state of dependency. Short-term help is often needed but as soon as possible people should be given resources to rebuild their lives. In terms of coherence people need to understand what has happened. For connectedness people need to part of any recovery processdcommunities that recover together will stay together.",

We need to recognize that cities themselves will be a locus for disasters as populations become urbanized and subject to new hazards. The institutions that deliver in disaster, especially the INGOs, need to question their own industry practices and standards and above all reconsider whether a nineteenth-century model of charity under benevolent capitalism is appropriate for humanitarian action in the twenty-first century.
