Under the context of a largescale on-going outbreak, contact patterns would drastically shift from their baseline conditions. In the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, social distancing measures including but not limited to school and workplace closures and health promotions that encourage the general public to avoid crowded places are designed to drastically shift social mixing patterns and are often used in epidemic settings. 4 While contact patterns can be inferred from reported social contact data that include the information in which setting the contact took place, such studies are often focused on high-income countries, 11 or particular high-density areas. 12 Prem and colleagues 13 address that limitation by quantifying contact patterns in the home, school, work and other locations across a range of countries based on available information from household-level data and local population demographic structure.",

If children were less infectious as described in M2, lifting the social distancing interventions in April instead of March could have less additional health benefits (Fig 5B and 5D ). Mathematical models can help us understand how SARS-CoV-2 would spread across the population and inform control measures that may mitigate future transmission. 24, 25 Here, we simulated the trajectory of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, using an age-structured SEIR model. 17, 18 Because individuals' mixing patterns are non-random, they influence the transmission dynamics of the disease. 11 Models assessing the effectiveness of social distancing interventions, such as school closure, need to account for social structures and heterogeneities in mixing of individuals. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] In our model, we incorporated changes to age-and location-specific social mixing patterns to estimate the effects of location-specific social distancing interventions in curtailing the spread of the outbreak. Consequently, if these restrictions are lifted prematurely while there are still enough susceptibles to keep the . > 1 once contacts increase, the number of infections would increase. Realistically, interventions are lifted slowly, partly as an attempt to avoid a sharp increase in infection, but also for logistical and practical reasons. Therefore, lifting the interventions was simulated in a staggered fashion, whereby the interventions were relaxed bit-by-bit (Figures 3, 4 and 5) . Much remains to be discovered about the true age-specific susceptibility and transmissibility of COVID-19. Therefore, we assumed no heterogeneity in susceptibility between children. Furthermore, .

            "text": "Since then, the local and national governments have taken unprecedented measures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2. 3 Exit screening of passengers was shortly followed by travel restrictions in Wuhan on 23 rd January 2020, halting all means of unauthorised travel into and out of the city. Similar control measures were extended to the entire province of Hubei by 26 th January 2020. 3 Non-pharmaceutical social distancing interventions such as extended school closure and workplace distancing were introduced to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. 4 Within the city, schools remained closed; Lunar New Year holidays were extended so that people stayed away from their workplaces; the local government promoted social distancing and encouraged residents to avoid crowded places. These measures are known to greatly changed the agespecific mixing patterns within the population in previous outbreak response efforts for other respiratory infectious diseases. 5,6 While travel restrictions undoubtedly had a role in reducing the exportations of infections outside of Wuhan, and delayed the onset of outbreaks in other regions, 7,8 changes in the mixing patterns affected the trajectory of the outbreak within Wuhan itself. In order to estimate the effects of social distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, we look at Wuhan, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world.",

To evaluate the effect of location-specific social distancing measures such as extended school closure and interventions around workplaces on the magnitude of the peak and the final size, we accounted for these heterogeneities in contact networks in our model. Here, we simulated outbreaks and modelled the interventions by scaling down the appropriate component of the contact mixing matrices for China.",

Distinguishing between repeated and new contacts is important for disease propagation in contact network models, 33,34 more sophisticated methods accounting for temporal presence within the household 35 would be needed to characterise higher degrees of contact. A key parameter is the basic reproduction number ( + ) which determines how fast SARS-CoV-2 spreads through the population during the early stages of the outbreak. This is an inherently difficult parameter to estimate, since the true number of cases that can transmit infection at a given time is unknown (reported cases are likely to be just a small fraction of these), and likely varies over time (due to different interventions being introduced and population behaviour changing in response to the epidemic). In our analysis, we used an existing model that inferred time-dependent . based on the growth of reported cases in Wuhan as well as number of exported cases outside China originating from Wuhan. 14 Social distancing and travel restrictions combined have clearly aided the lowering of the transmission of COVID-19 over the course of the ongoing outbreak in Wuhan. 8,36,37 Evidence for this drop in transmission can be gleaned from the time-varying estimates of the reproductive number, 14 or, even more simply, observing that the turnover of the epidemic has occurred far before the depletion of the susceptibles indicates the effects of the implemented measures. Insofar as social distancing alone is responsible for the drop is extremely difficult to quantify, especially during the ongoing epidemic. Therefore we took a broad-view of the question, making assumptions about the result of certain forms of social distancing and measuring the effects somewhat qualitatively. However, it is clear that to a greater or lesser extent, social distancing has resulted in both a shorter epidemic and one with a lower peak. Given what is known about the transmissibility and (the relatively long) incubation period of COVID-19, 1,15 the efficacy of social distancing in reducing these important attributes of any epidemic are no surprise.",
