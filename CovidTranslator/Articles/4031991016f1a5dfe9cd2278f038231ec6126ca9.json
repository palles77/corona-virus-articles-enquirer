            "text": "The majority of viral infections of the airways are associated with asthma exacerbations in children. Two thirds of these viral infections are caused by rhinovirus, and hospital admissions for asthma correlate with the seasonal peak of rhinovirus infections. 1 TGF-b is a cytokine known to induce forkhead box P3 1 (FoxP3) regulatory T (Treg) cells and retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (ROR) gt 1 T H 17 cells in combination with IL-2 or IL-6, respectively, but also to inhibit the differentiation of T H 1 and T H 2 cells. 2 Because TGF-b and rhinovirus infection both influence asthma exacerbation and TGF-b also induces rhinovirus replication, 3 in this study we analyzed the effect of rhinovirus infection on TGF-b and the role of TGF-b on rhinovirus infection by analyzing asthmatic and nonasthmatic preschool children recruited in the European study Post-infectious Immune Reprogramming and Its Association with Persistence and Chronicity of Respiratory Allergic Diseases (PreDicta) and a murine model of asthma. The clinical data of the analyzed cohorts of children are reported in Table E1 and in the Methods section in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org. In asthmatic children, in 66.6% of the cases, a viral infection was a triggering factor for development of the disease. Rhinovirus was the most common respiratory virus detected in the airways of these children (see Table  E2 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).",

Because TGF-b induces Treg cells, 2 we first investigated which genes related to tolerance were significantly regulated by rhinovirus in PBMCs from these children. Here we found that in asthmatic children rhinovirus upregulated immunosuppressive genes, such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1; CD274), and interferon-induced transmembrane protein 2 (IFITM2; Fig 1, B and C). Consistent with the array data, we found that IDO1 was upregulated in PBMCs of asthmatic children cultured with rhinovirus compared with those of control children (see Fig E1, A, in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). This regulation was found to be independent from steroids because dexamethasone significantly downregulated IDO in PBMCs (see Fig E1, B) .",

We noticed that TGF-binhibitory genes, such as TGIF2 and LAP3, were upregulated in rhinovirus-treated PBMCs from asthmatic children. Moreover, rhinovirus inhibited genes that cleave viruses, such as RNASE1, in PBMCs from children with asthma (Fig 1, B and C). By contrast, in control children rhinovirus did not significantly regulate these genes. In these children other factors were found to be significantly regulated by rhinovirus, such as lymphocyte antigen 6E (Fig 1, D and E) , a protein involved in the TGF-b pathway. Moreover, we found that in PBMCs from control children, rhinovirus induced IL-32 (Fig 1, C and D) . Expression of this protein is known to induce the production of IL-6 and TNF-a and might thereby modulate immune responses. 4 In subsequent experiments we analyzed in more detail the regulation of TGF-b in a larger group of children in the same cohort. Among PBMC supernatants, TGF-b protein was detected in high amounts in untreated cell-culture supernatants in both asthmatic and control children. However, after ex vivo challenge with rhinovirus, TGF-b protein expression was found to be significantly decreased (Fig 2, A) , although TGFB mRNA expression remained constant (Fig 2, B) . Because rhinovirus infection suppressed TGF-b release, we assumed that rhinovirus facilitates TGF-b binding to the cell membrane, and for this reason, we could not detect it in the supernatants of rhinovirus-infected PBMCs.",

At the moment, we do not know which cells are infected by rhinovirus in the PBMC population we examined; however, we assume that plasmacytoid dendritic cells are infected because of the induction of IDO after rhinovirus challenge ex vivo. 6 However, rhinovirus infection also activates TGF-b present in the environment, as in patients with chronic asthma, to replicate and inhibit effective antiviral immune responses. Thus it is possible that children with acute asthma are able to induce an effective anti-rhinovirus immune response during acute exacerbation. By contrast, in patients with chronic asthma, TGF-b is increased in its active form and is released by structural cells. In this latter situation, when the rhinovirus infects plasmacytoid dendritic cells, this exogenous TGF-b inhibits T H 1 and T C 1 cells that carry the TGF-b receptor, resulting in T H 1 cell depletion, and thus rhinovirus infection cannot be cleared. Although these data need further investigation, they open new avenues for our understanding of the role of rhinovirus-mediated asthma exacerbations in children. ",
