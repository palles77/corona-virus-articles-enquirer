In 28 this study, we aim to explore whether the CRISPR/Cas13d system can be used to inhibit the syndrome virus (PRRSV) as a model to test the hypothesis. Porcine reproductive and respiratory 31 syndrome (PRRS) caused by PRRSV is one of the most severe infectious diseases in the swine 32 industry, which leads to a huge economic loss worldwide (Chand et al., 2012; Zhou and Yang, 33 2010) . PPPSV is an enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus belonging to the Arteriviridae family in 34 the order of Nidovirales (Snijder et al., 2013) . 35 We constructed a reporter system to rapidly test the RNA cleavage efficiency of the 36 CRISPR/Cas13d system. The reporter vectors were composed of the mCherry fluorescence gene 37 fused with either PRRSV ORF4 or ORF5 under the control of a CMV promoter, with two nuclear 38 localization signals (NLSs) at the N-and C-termini of mCherry to localize the fusion proteins in the 39 nucleus ( Fig. S1A ). Seven 30-bp oligonucleotides, including one random sequence as the non-target 40 guide RNA (gRNA) control (NC-gRNA) and six gRNA sequences targeting ORF4 (ORF4-gRNAs) 41 or ORF5 (ORF5-gRNAs), were synthesized and cloned into gRNA-expression vectors, respectively 42 ( Fig. S1A ). The human codon-optimized Cas13d was synthesized and cloned into an expression 43 vector with two NLSs at its N-and C-termini and driven by the CMV promoter (named 44 NLS-Cas13d) (Fig. S1A) . A control vector containing a mutated Cas13d which lacks the 45 ribonuclease activity (named NLS-dCas13d) was also constructed ( NLS-Cas13d/ORF4-gRNAs was significantly decreased (Fig. 1A) . Further qRT-PCR analysis 52 revealed that the mRNA expression levels of mCherry-ORF4 were significantly decreased by 96%, 53 90%, and 95% by ORF4-gRNA1, ORF4-gRNA2, and ORF4-gRNA3, respectively (P < 0.0001; Fig.  54 efficiently knocked down the expression of mCherry-ORF4 or mCherry-ORF5 (90%) compared 60 with that combined with the NC-gRNA (P < 0.0001) (Fig. S1B) off-target events exist, we blasted ORF4-gRNA1 and ORF5-gRNA1 against the human reference 107 genome, and selected MAGI1 and NUP210 (having a high similarity with ORF4-gRNA1) and 108 5 dCas13d/gRNA-transfected cells (Fig. S3B) . Together, these results indicated the CRISPR/Cas13d 117 system used in this study has little or no significant off-target effects. 118 Viral infections underlie a variety of different diseases impacting both public health and 119 agricultural industries greatly. In this study, we focused on the antiviral capacity of the 120 CRISPR/Cas13d system and presented a new strategy for mammalian RNA virus interference. 121",

In the 62 following experiments, we chose ORF4-gRNA1 and ORF5-gRNA1 as the gRNAs to target 63 GFP-PRRSVs in Marc145 cells. 64 PRRSVs infect monocytic lineage, especially the differentiated macrophages, including 65 porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), because of its tropism. Meanwhile, PRRSVs propagate in 66 the African green monkey kidney cell line MA104 and its derivatives, including Marc145, Vero, 67 and CL 2621 cells, in vitro. (Kim et al., 1993). Thus, we use a novel GFP-PRRSV obtained from the 68 Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University of China (Wang et al., 2013) to challenge Marc145 69 cells to evaluate the inhibition efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas13d system on PRRSV RNA synthesis 70 and viral replication at the cellular level. 71 Previous studies have shown that Cas13b fused with a nuclear export signal (NES) and Cas13d 72 fused with a NLS present the highest RNA cleavage efficiency (Konermann et al., 2018; Smargon et 73 al., 2017). Since RNA viruses are mainly located in the cytoplasm of infected cells, we designed an 74 NES-Cas13d expression vector via separately fusing two NESs to the N-and C-termini of Cas13d 75 and used the NLS-Cas13d and NLS-dCas13d expression vectors as controls (Figs. S1A and S2A). 76 500 ng Cas13d expression vectors and 500 ng gRNA expression vectors were transfected into 77 Marc145 cells in a 24-well plate using the Lipofectamine LTX Plus transfection reagent with an 78 average transfection efficiency of 50%. At 12 hpt, GFP-PRRSVs at a MOI (multiplicity of infection) 79 of 0.01 were added to the cells. At 48 hours post-infection (hpi), the fluorescence protein Cas13d/ORF4-gRNA1 and NES-Cas13d/ORF5-gRNA1 compared with the control cells 82 transfected with NLS-Cas13d/NC-gRNA (Fig. 1C). The mRNA expression levels of PRRSV-ORF4 83 and PRRSV-ORF5 were significantly decreased by 64% and 58% in cells transfected with the 84 NES-Cas13d/ORF4-gRNA1 and NES-Cas13d/ORF5-gRNA1 cells (P < 0.001), respectively, 85 compared with the control cells transfected with NLS-dCas13d/NC-RNA (Fig. 1D). The fluorescent RNA synthesis in Marc145 cells. 90 We collected the supernatants of the Marc145 cells during 0-72 hpi of GFP-PRRSVs at a MOI 91 of 0.01, which had been first transfected with the Cas13d and gRNA expression vectors. The titers 92 of collected viruses were detected by the TCID50 assay. During 0-72 hpi, compare with the 93 NLS-dCas13d/NC-gRNA control group, the titers of GFP-PRRSVs produced in the cells 94 transfected with NES-Cas13d/ORF4-gRNA1 and NES-Cas13d/ORF5-gRNA1 were significantly 95 decreased, which were profoundly decreased during 0-36 hpi, started to rise during 36-60 hpi, and 96 reached the plateau at 60 hpi (Fig. 1E and F). In addition, the viral titers were significantly 97 decreased 95% at 36 hpi by NES-Cas13d/ORF4-gRNA1 and significantly decreased by 82% at 36 98 hpi by NES-Cas13d/ORF5-gRNA1, compared with the NLS-dCas13d/NC-gRNA control group 99 (Fig. 1E and F). These results indicate that the replication of GFP-PRRSVs has been disrupted by 100 NES-Cas13d/gRNA. 101 The off-target effect was one of the most serious concerns in the applications of the 102 CRISPR/Cas system. Previously studies have shown that upon crRNA-mediated recognition of its 103 complementary target sites, both Cas13a and Cas13b transit to an activated state, in which they 104 exhibit a non-specific RNA endonuclease activity termed trans-cleavage (Abudayyeh et al., 2017; 105 East-Seletsky et al., 2016; Myhrvold et al., 2018; Smargon et al., 2017).

Compared with the NLS-dCas13d/NC-gRNA control cells, the 127 NES-Cas13d/gRNA significantly knocked down the GFP-PRRSV expression in Marc145 cells 128 (decreased by 64% by NES-Cas13d/ORF4-gRNA1 and decreased by 58% by 129 NES-Cas13d/ORF5-gRNA1), while NLS-Cas13d/gRNA did not show significant viral RNA 130 cleavages. The viral titers of GFP-PRRSVs collected from the supernatant of NLS-Cas13d/gRNA 131 transfected cells were only slightly lower than those from the NLS-dCas13d/NC-gRNA transfected 132 group and the NC group (a pure negative control without transfection) (Fig. 1D-F). The possible 133 reasons are: 1) the ssRNA genome of PRRSV is replicated and transcribed in the cytoplasm; 2) 134 NLS-Cas13d proteins mature in the cytoplasm and then are localized in the nucleus; 3) the process 135 of viral RNA cleavage is short. The viral RNA cleavage efficiency of NES-Cas13d was not as high 136 as the reporter system, which might be due to the relatively low transfection efficiency and the low 137 viral titer. After knocking down the mCherry-ORF4/5 mRNA expression by NLS-Cas13d/gRNA, 138 we did not observe changes in the gene expression of the potential off-target endogenous genes and 139 the cell viability of Marc145 cells (Fig. S3), indicating that the CRISPR/Cas13d system used in this 140 study is safe for the host cells. 141 Currently, Cas13d may be the best RNA-targeting CRISPR enzyme for mammalian RNA 142 engineering. Like other Cas13 proteins, the Cas13d enzyme can efficiently target virtually any RNA 143 sequences without the need of a protospacer flanking sequence. Besides its high cleavage efficiency, ., 2018). A study has shown that Cas13d can be used to modulate the splicing of endogenous 148 transcripts without changing the host genome, and its size is small enough to fit within the 149 packaging limit of AAV for in vivo delivery (Konermann et al., 2018). AAV can be one of the 150 suitable ways to package, deliver, and express the CRISPR/Cas13d system for targeting RNA 151 viruses in vivo in clinical trials of gene therapies in the near future. The life cycles of both RNA 152 viruses and DNA viruses both require the RNA stage, the CRISPR/Cas13d system may be a feasible 153 and efficient way for eukaryotic cells to defend against both RNA viruses and DNA viruses. Our 154 results demonstrated that Cas13d is suitable for RNA virus inhibition, and it may be also a potential 155 tool for DNA virus interference. Though CRISPR/Cas13d system is a potential tool for RNA 156 virus inhibition, there still exits several resistances, such as the work mechanisms of the 157 CRISPR/Cas13d system, how to ascertain the effective time of Cas13d, and how to deliver the 158 CRISPR/Cas13d to the target cells when RNA viruses infect host. 159In summary, we first reported the use of Cas13d for the highly efficient interference of 160PRRSVs. These results demonstrated that the CRISPR/Cas13d RNA cleavage system may serve as 161 a feasible and efficient tool for eukaryotic cells to defend against RNA viruses. This strategy has 162 profound future uses in the treatment of human and farming animal diseases caused by Prof. Enmin Zhou (Northwest A&F University, China) for providing us the GFP-PRRSV 167 recombinant virus.
