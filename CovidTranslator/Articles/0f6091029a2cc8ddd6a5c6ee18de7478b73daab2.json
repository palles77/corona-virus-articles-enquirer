This new variant was formed by a triple reassortment, with genomic segments from swine, avian, and human influenza origins. The objective of this study was to analyze sequences of hemagglutinin (n=2038) and neuraminidase (n=1273) genes, in order to assess the extent of diversity among circulating 2009-2010 strains, estimate if these genes evolved through positive, negative, or neutral selection models of evolution during the pandemic phase, and analyze the worldwide percentage of detection of important amino acid mutations that could enhance the viral performance, such as transmissibility or resistance to drugs. A continuous surveillance by public health authorities will be critical to monitor the appearance of new influenza variants, especially in animal reservoirs such as swine and birds, in order to prevent the potential animal-human transmission of viruses with pandemic potential.",

In mid April, the Centers for Disease Control from USA identified the new virus in two cases from California. The new virus spread rapidly throughout the world, and as a consequence the WHO authorities declared the \"Pandemic (H1N1) 2009\" on June 11, 2009 [3] . It is thought that the new 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus (from here, 2009 H1N1pdm) has emerged through at least four reassortment and transmission events among swine, avian and human H1N1 lineages, probably in Asia and North America [4] . Particularly, the HA segment of 2009 H1N1pdm was originated from American swine lineage, whereas the NA segment derived from the European swine lineage [5, 6] .

A number of different amino acid mutations that could confer new functionalities to the new virus were reported worldwide, including those related to increased pathogenicity or antiviral resistance ( Table 2) . Polymorphism at position 239 in HA has been associated with severe clinical outcomes, especially in immunocompromised patients; in particular, substitution 239G was found to correlate with fatal outcomes in different countries [17, 18] . Furthermore, this mutation can arise de novo from wildtype (D239) virus in the same patient throughout the disease course [19] . Mutation at position 239 can induce alterations in the receptor binding site, and 239G mutants bind a broader range of 2-3-linked sialyl receptors sequences expressed on cells from the lower respiratory tract, which suggested that its presence could be responsible for the exacerbation of disease [20] . Mutants 239E target mainly non-ciliated cells. We found no significant difference between sequences bearing mutations 239G (2.6%) and 239E (5.5%). The low percentage of global circulation of mutants 239G found in this study is in accordance with its lower potential to transmit to other individuals [21] .",

The amino acid S220, though not exposed to the surface, is localized in the receptor binding domain (RBD), and its change could affect the transmissibility and infectivity of H1N1 in humans. The fixed mutation, S220T, has been found at high percentage (76.7%) in this study. To test whether change 220T could contribute to antigenic drift, it would be interesting to compare its antigenic profile against a wildtype isolate (S220). This mutation, probably, has become fixed in all pandemic strains through optimization of viral fitness, rather than immune selection or adaptation to the host. Substitution S101N has been proposed previously as a reversion to the seasonal H1N1 residue 101N and thus possibly an adaptation to the human host, being found in some studies at high frequencies. Its global impact, however, is controvertible because it was found in only 0.2% of our sequences. Substitution E391K, found at 15.6% in our study, has been identified as part of a highly conserved epitope in the 1918 H1N1 virus with a possible role in membrane fusion [22] . Another proximal substitution found in other studies, N387H, was found in only 1.7% of our sequences.",

We found both mutations at high percentages, 85.1% and 85.9% respectively, in our dataset. Change 106I was present in the 20th century cases of H1N1 (in 1918 [pandemic] , and 1977), as well as 248D (in 1977). Since residue at position 248 is located at the drug target domain (DTD) region, as residue 275, it could potentially affect the sensitivity to NA inhibitors. Another substitution of possible interest in NA sequences is D199N, which was previously associated with an increase in oseltamivir resistance in both seasonal and H5N1 virus strains [24] . We found, however, only 4 out of 1273 NA sequences (0.3%) containing this change. The rare substitution I223R, which was reported in association with resistance to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir [25] , was also found in only 2 out of 1273 NA sequences (0.2%). Substitution H275Y has been related to oseltamivir resistance, especially in immunocompromised or severely ill persons [26] . It was found, however, in sporadic cases in most of the countries at low frequencies (~1%) [27] . In our study, we found 2% of sequences containing this change.",
