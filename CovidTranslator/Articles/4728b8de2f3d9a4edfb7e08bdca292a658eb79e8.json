In this study, we applied a novel approach to identify small fragments that act synergistically with these inhibitors. A fragment library was screened in combination with four previously developed lead inhibitors by fluorescence-based enzymatic assays. Several fragment compounds synergistically enhanced the inhibitory activity of the lead inhibitors by approximately an order of magnitude. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements showed that three fragments bind specifically to the PLpro enzyme. Mode of inhibition, computational solvent mapping, and molecular docking studies suggest that these fragments bind adjacent to the binding site of the lead inhibitors and further stabilize the inhibitor-bound state. We propose potential next generation compounds based upon a computational, fragment-merging approach. This approach provides an alternative strategy for lead optimization in cases where direct co-crystallization is difficult. .",

It was contained through public health quarantine measures after several months. The isolation of closely related strains from the horseshoe bat has been reported, [2] which suggests a potential for reemergence of the SARS-CoV by retransmission to humans from its animal reservoir. There have also been three additional human coronaviruses, HCoV-HKU1, [3] HCoV-NL63, [4] and HCoV-EMC, [5] reported since 2003. HCov-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 were shown to be less lethal than SARS-CoV. [3b, 6] However, since April 2012, fifteen people have been infected with the most recently identified coronavirus, HCoV-EMC, nine of whom died from pneumonia and renal failure. [7] The whole genome sequence of HCov-EMC has been characterized, and it has shown a close similarity to two Asian bat coronaviruses, BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5. [8] This opens a strong possibility of the emergence of new strains of SARS or new SARS-like human coronaviruses that could lead to even more deadly outbreaks.",

            "text": "Human SARS-CoV has a positive RNA genome with a size of 30 kb and contains two proteases, 3-Chymotrypsin-Like protease (3CLpro) and Papain-Like protease (PLpro). PLpro and 3CLpro are responsible for cleavage of the polyprotein into 16 nonstructural proteins. The first three positions between nonstructural proteins, 1 through 4, are cleaved by PLpro, while the other eleven positions are cleaved by 3CLpro. Both 3CLpro and PLpro have been shown to be essential for viral replication, [9] making them attractive drug targets against SARS-CoV. 3CLpro has been intensively pursued as a drug target and several inhibitors have been reported. They can be categorized as covalent peptidomimetic, noncovalent peptidomimetic, and non-peptidic. [10] Unlike 3CLpro, the development of PLpro inhibitors has been very limited until recently, despite its essential role in SARS viral replication. In addition to our own work, [11] two very different types of PLpro inhibitors have been reported in recent years. First, 6-Mercaptopurine (6MP) and 6-thioguanine (6TG) were identified from compound screening with IC 50 values of 5 -20 \u00b5M. [12] Second, several natural products, diarylheptanoids isolated from Alnus Japonica, showed inhibitory activity (4.1 \u00b5M IC 50 ) against PLpro. [13] In addition to its primary function of viral peptide cleavage, PLpro has been recognized to be involved in deubiquitination, de-ISGylation, and viral evasion of the innate immune response. [2a, 14] SARS-PLpro is a cysteine protease that contains a zinc-binding motif, a catalytic triad, and an ubiquitin-like N-terminal domain ( Figure 1 ). The sequence identity and similarity between SARS-PLpro and HCoV-EMC PLpro are 32% and 51%, respectively (Supporting Information (SI) Figure S1a ). Interestingly, the predicted structure of the HCoV-EMC PLpro is very similar to the crystal structure of the SARS-PLpro (SI Figure S1b ). The three catalytic residues (C112, H273, and D287) and four cysteines in the zinc-binding motif are identical in these two PLpro enzymes. In addition, nine highly conserved residues in many other PLpro enzymes are also observed in HCoV-EMC PLpro (highlighted in yellow in SI Figure S1a ). This suggests that HCoV-EMC PLpro may possess characteristics similar to that of SARS-PLpro.",

Inhibitors 2 (GRL-0617S), 3 (GRL-0667S) and 4 (GRL-0737S) have exhibited inhibitory activities of 1.32 \u00b5M, 0.64 \u00b5M and 1.36 \u00b5M, with antiviral activities of 15 \u00b5M, 9.1 \u00b5M and 9.1 \u00b5M, respectively. [11a, 15] These inhibitors represent two active chemical scaffolds, with 1 and 2 representing the first (Scaffold A), and 3 and 4 representing the second (Scaffold B). Because these four lead inhibitors show moderate antiviral activity against SARS-CoV, their potencies must be further improved in order to be developed into clinical candidates. Through an analysis of the two available PLpro structures with inhibitors 2 and 3 and subsequent molecular modeling studies, it was revealed that these leading inhibitors bind to a pocket mostly contributed by the G267-G272 loop and the Leu163 side chain, distinct from the catalytic site shown in green in Figure 1 . [11b, 15] The inhibitors appear to block substrate access to the entrance of the catalytic site of the PLpro enzyme.",

This would require the synthesis of larger compounds, a process that consumes significant amounts of time and resources, and may or may not result in better binding affinity and potency. An alternative strategy is the application of fragment-based drug design (FBDD) methodology, which has become a well-established method for lead optimization. [16] In many cases, FBDD has been used to discover small scaffolds for further optimization or to find two small fragments that can be linked together in order to produce a more potent inhibitor. [16e] In order to be able to link two small fragments, solving crystal structures with each fragment is typically necessary. In many cases, obtaining this structural information can be very challenging and time-consuming due to the typical weak binding affinity of fragments for their target enzymes. In this study, we used FBDD in combination with detailed enzymatic analysis as a means to further optimize our leading inhibitors without using crystallography. By testing a small library of fragment compounds in the presence of each of the lead inhibitors, we have been able to identify fragments that synergistically improve the potency of the leading inhibitors. Additional enzymatic analyses (including mechanism of inhibition and mutual exclusivity studies, described in detail below) and computational studies were used to predict the fragment binding locations. Finally, a fragment-merging strategy was employed to predict next generation compounds that are able to recapitulate the binding position of the lead inhibitors, as well as key binding features of the identified fragments.",

This leaves the catalytic site unoccupied during inhibition. Although the catalytic pocket is small, there is a reasonable probability that fragment compounds could successfully bind to this location and enhance inhibitory activity of the lead inhibitors. The Zenobia library, consisting of 352 chemically and structurally diverse fragment-like compounds, was experimentally screened in the presence of each of the four previously discovered lead inhibitors. All fragment compounds were tested by continuous kinetic enzymatic assays as described in Methods, below. A replicate plot of inhibitor 2 with the 352 fragments showed highly reproducible results (SI Figure S2a ). The replicate plots of the other lead inhibitors were similar to that of inhibitor 2. Of the 352 fragment-like compounds, 17, 14, 16, and 16 fragments showed greater than 30% increase in enzyme inhibition when tested at 200 \u00b5M fragment concentration in the presence of inhibitors 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Percentage efficiency indices (PEI) for all 352 fragments were calculated as a hit selection criteria according to the method of Abad-Zapatero and coworkers; percent inhibition was divided by molecular weight (MW) of each compound. [17] Compounds with PEI values of 1.5 or greater were classified as hits, and the medium range (PEI 2.0 -4.0) compounds were selected for further testing. High PEI range (> 4.0) compounds were classified as outliers due to the strong likelihood of non-specificity. The histogram of PEI values for all 352 fragments in combination with each of our four lead inhibitors is shown in SI Figure S2b . A total of 13 fragments were in the medium PEI range and were selected for further studies.",

Of the 13 fragmentlike compounds, eight fragments showed synergistic enhancement with IC 50 value reductions more than 3-fold for at least one of the lead inhibitors.

PLpro is a cysteine protease that contains a cysteine in the active site, and these partially irreversible fragments may covalently interact with this cysteine residue. Covalently interacting compounds are likely to be nonspecifically reactive and usually have toxicity issues. Therefore, fragment F3 may not be a good candidate, although it was the best enhancer for Scaffold B inhibitors (inhibitors 3 and 4). Similarly, these results indicate that fragment F5 may also exhibit problems with irreversibility. Two ligand efficiency-related indices, binding efficiency index (BEI) and surface-binding efficiency index (SEI), were calculated as described. [18] BEI relates potency to the molecular weight of each compound, while SEI is an index that monitors the potency gains as polar surface area (PSA) increases. BEI and SEI for these 8 fragments and four lead inhibitors were calculated by simple equations: pIC 50 divided by MW for BEI and pIC 50 divided by PSA for SEI. [17] The PSA value is an important indicator related to oral bioavailability and intestinal permeability. [19] The BEI values of fragments F3, F4, and F7 were above 25, suggesting that they are outliers due to the possibility of non-specific interaction (SI Figure S2c ). Fragment F7 contains an aldehyde, which is likely to exhibit non-specific affinity for the cysteine residue in the catalytic site of the PLpro enzyme. Thus, considering both ligand efficiency indices and enzyme activity recovery rate, fragments F8, F8, F6/F8, and F6 are the best enhancers for inhibitors 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.",

Enzymatic assays alone can lead to false positives in some cases. In order to investigate this further, orthogonal binding analyses by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) were performed, and the dissociation equilibrium constants (K D ), which reflect binding affinity, were determined for each of the four lead inhibitors (1 -4) and the seven newly identified fragments (F2 -F8). Fragment F1 was excluded from these studies due to its low IC 50 enhancement. The binding affinities of inhibitors 1 -4 varied between 0.97 \u00b5M and 1.67 \u00b5M as determined by SPR, which were in a similar range to their IC 50 values (Table 2 and Figure 2a) . Promisingly, the binding affinities of fragments F2, F6, and F8 were 202 \u00b5M, 461 \u00b5M, and 437 \u00b5M, respectively. The K D fitting curve of F8 is shown in Figure 2b as an example. However, three fragments, fragments F3, F4, and F7, were suspected of forming non-specific interactions due to their unusually high BEI values as noted above. SPR analyses confirmed that these three fragments, as well as fragment F5, all bind non-specifically. Fragments F3, F4, and F7 did not show a typical dose-response curve as their concentrations increased; instead they showed a random binding pattern as shown Figure 2c for F3. Fragment F5 did show a typical dose-response curve, but SPR response units increased to almost 4,000 RU when its concentration increased to 800 \u00b5M ( Figure 2d ). This is likely due to multisite binding caused by aggregation rather than one-to-one interaction with the PLpro enzyme, suggesting that the fragment may bind to many different locations on the PLpro enzyme.",

[14] [15] Two crystal structures with these compounds verify that they bind at the entrance of the catalytic site, blocking substrate access to the site. Although these lead inhibitors do not bind directly to the catalytic site, they nonetheless display competitive inhibition patterns. To thoroughly investigate the inhibition mechanism of both lead inhibitors and fragment compounds, kinetic studies for each compound were performed with the enzyme-inhibitor complexes and varying substrate concentrations. The data were fitted to four equations (Equations 2 -5 in Methods) and three plots (Michaelis-Menton, Lineweaver-Burk, and Dixon), each using SigmaPlot Enzyme kinetics Module 1.3. Akaike Information Criterion corrected (AICc) values were used to determine the best fit equation, [20] where the lowest AICc value corresponds to the best fit equation. In order to be able to determine which equation fits the best, the AICc value difference has to be at least 2 units from the next lowest. [20] All four previously developed lead inhibitors showed noncompetitive inhibition with unequal binding affinity to free enzyme (E) and substrate-bound enzyme (ES), where the alpha (\u03b1) value is not equal to 1 ( Table 2 ). All four lead inhibitors showed \u03b1 values greater than 1, which indicates the binding affinity to free enzyme is tighter than that of ES. Dixon plots for noncompetitive inhibition of inhibitor 1 (\u03b1 = 2.6) with respect to the substrate are shown in Figure 3a , and the resulting K i value was 0.42 \u00b5M. All three fragments showed noncompetitive inhibition with different \u03b1 values as well. Fragments F6 and F8 had \u03b1 values greater than 1 (\u03b1 > 1), indicating that these fragments also behave similar to the lead inhibitors although \u03b1 values of these fragments were smaller than those of the lead inhibitors. This may explain why F8 displayed the strongest effect with the three lead inhibitors (1, 2, and 3), while fragment F6 exhibited the strongest synergistic effect with Scaffold B inhibitors (3 and 4). Dixon plots for noncompetitive inhibition of fragment F8 (\u03b1 = 1.6) are shown in Figure 3b , and the K i value was determined to be 242 \u00b5M. Because all four lead inhibitors and two fragments showed noncompetitive inhibition with \u03b1 values greater than 1, it is likely that these compounds bind to another site that is not a catalytic site, hindering substrate binding to the enzyme. These studies therefore suggest that it is unlikely that these newly identified fragment-like compounds bind to the catalytic site of the PLpro enzyme.",

Unfortunately this information is insufficient to identify where the fragments bind on the PLpro enzyme. Therefore, we investigated all possible binding site candidates. The unexplored catalytic pocket was designated as candidate fragment binding site 1, although our mechanism of inhibition studies indicated that this location was not likely to be the fragment binding site. To identify additional candidate fragment binding sites, we performed a series of computational solvent mapping experiments, or 'hot spot' analyses, using the FTMAP server (see Methods). [21] FTMAP is a multistage protein mapping algorithm that is based on a fast Fourier transform (FFT) correlation. This approach can efficiently search for potential binding sites on the entire surface of the protein. Two model systems, crystal structures of inhibitor 2 bound to PLpro (PDB ID: 3e9s) and inhibitor 3 bound to PLpro (PDB ID: 3mj5), were used for the analyses. These two provided representative crystal structures for each compound scaffold. Using a total of 50 nanoseconds of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for each system (3e9s, 3mj5), we determined that the major fluctuations of both structures come from the zinc binding motif and a beta sheet forming the catalytic triad. Representative snapshot structures were extracted from the simulations as discussed below (see Methods) and submitted to the FTMAP server, which performed a fragment-based binding site analysis. Two strong candidate fragment binding sites were identified by analyzing the original structures and consensus clusters of the probes molecules used (see Methods below). The two hot spots identified by this analysis included an extension of the original binding site of the lead inhibitors and one cavity in the palm region (shown in Figure 4a ). Hot spot 1 was larger than the lead inhibitor binding site and included an additional cavity unoccupied by the lead inhibitors. This binding site has been previously discussed as a possible substrate recognition site. [11] This extended cavity is composed of five residues, R167, E168, M209, D303, and T302. The second position identified by FTMAP, hot spot 2, was located more than 10 \u00c5 away from both the lead inhibitor binding site and the catalytic site of the PLpro. It is encompassed by the zinc-binding motif and the palm region. Lastly, the small volume containing the catalytic triad (site 1) was not identified by FTMAP, likely due to the smaller size of this pocket.",

These studies were performed using three potential binding sites, site 1 (the catalytic site), site 2 (the extended lead inhibitor binding site), and site 3 identified by coarse docking. Hot spot 2 was excluded from these studies due to the large distance (>10 \u00c5) from the inhibitor binding site. Hot spot 2 is very shallow, highly solvent exposed, and located between the zinc-binding motif and the palm region (see Figures 4a) . More importantly, it appears likely that even if binding of small fragments to this position could cause some degree of conformational changes to these two regions, any structural change would not be likely to affect the lead inhibitor binding site to enhance their IC 50 values to the extent observed. For these reasons, as well as the impracticality of fragment-linking or merging strategies at such a distance, Hot spot 2 was excluded from further analyses.",

This suggests that the shallow and solvent exposed binding site 3 is also not an appropriate position for fragment binding. Hence, the site was also removed from consideration and further analysis of this site was not performed. Additionally, an analysis of the MMPBSA results ( Figure 5 , SI Tables S1, and S2) revealed that the catalytic site, site 1, was also not a favorable position for fragment binding. The binding free energy values for the inhibitor with Fragment F8 at this position were higher than those calculated for the inhibitor alone as well as the experimentally derived results. These results, when taken together with the experimental results discussed above, indicate that the catalytic site is most likely not the binding site of the identified, synergistic fragments. Favorable results that closely aligned with experimental values were obtained, however, when the fragments were placed at binding site 2 (shown in Figure 6 ), consistent with synergistic activity. We noted a preference for a positive charge, as seen in the F8 piperazine amine group, to be placed into an anionic pocket of site 2, defined by D303, T302, Y274, and D165, which in combination with the established binding features of the lead inhibitors, resulted in a clear gain in their calculated binding affinity. An additional edge-to-face Pi stacking interaction between the naphthalene ring system and the aromatic ring system of fragment F8 (visible in Figure 6 ) may further stabilize the lead inhibitors in their binding conformations.",

Our characterization assays of the binding mechanism of the two newly identified fragment compounds showed noncompetitive inhibition. This indicated that the synergistic fragment compounds did not bind to the catalytic site of the PLpro enzyme. Computational analysis predicted several potential fragment binding sites, and more expansive studies revealed a preference for fragment binding to site 2, an extension of the lead inhibitor binding site, when the inhibitor binding site was occupied by representative structures.

[26] The structures of PLpro bound with GRL-0617S (PDB id: 3E9S) and GRL-0667S (PDB id: 3MJ5) were obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB). Prior to the molecular docking, structures of protein targets were prepared using the Protein Preparation Wizard in the Schr\u00f6dinger software package (Suite 2012). All water molecules in the crystal structures were removed, and crystal multimers were reduced to the monomer. Residues that were located within 5\u00c5 of the bound inhibitors were refined by the Prime algorithm. Two distinct docking runs were performed using this strategy. The first docking run was blind docking (coarse docking), with the docking area defined to be within 10\u00c5 of the lead inhibitors. Candidate site 3 was identified during these studies as a high-scoring binding site for multiple fragments. The subsequent docking runs were defined by the location of the candidate sites identified by the structural and computational analyses, described above. Binding site 1 (the catalytic site) was defined by selecting residues H273, C112 and D287; binding site 2 was defined by selecting residues R167, E168, M209, D303, T302; and binding site 3 was defined by selecting residues N157 K158, D165 and E168. Binding hot spot 2 was not studied for the reasons described above. In each case, the docking area was defined to be a 10\u00c5 box centered on the selected residues. Fragments of the Zenobia library were prepared in multiple tautomer and protonation states at pH 7.4 by Schr\u00f6dinger's LigPrep. [27] All eight active fragments were docked in the coarse docking studies; only fragment F8 was docked in the subsequent candidate site docking studies. All docking poses were ranked by Glide XP score. [28] In the second docking run, three conformations (poses) each of F8 at each binding site (sites 1, 2, and 4) produced by IFD were selected as the starting conformations for the MD simulations and subsequent MM/PBSA calculation, described below. The binding poses selected included the top score pose and two other poses which possessed the greatest difference (by calculated RMSD).",

With the goal of retaining the lead binding position of the inhibitor scaffold after docking the merged hybrids, we investigated several alternative linking strategies, including linking to the naphthalene ring, the chiral methyl group, and the P-toluidine (Scaffold A) or methylenedioxy-benzene (Scaffold B) by alkyl groups, ester groups, and amide groups.
