            "text": "Over 37 000 immigrants are currently detained by Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) in more than 130 facilities across the USA. 1 As understandable fear of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic intensifies in the USA, so too does the imminent danger ICE prisons pose not only to the vulnerable populations detained within their walls but to the nation's public health. Given the urgent need to control the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), ICE should release all detained immigrants posing no threat to public safety. 1 Overcrowding, poor sanitation, inadequate healthcare, and difficulty containing contagious diseases are well documented in ICE's immigration detention system. 3,4,5 Most facilities are run by private prisons or county jails through lucrative ICE subcontracts. Distancing and other necessary measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 from spreading are not possible in immigrant prisons. These congregate detention facilities pose a great contagion risk: already, several staff at different immigrant detention centres have tested positive for COVID-19 and detainee infections are being reported as well. 6 Since 2014, the detained immigrant population has skyrocketed. Last year, ICE detained over 500 000 immigrants, more than the rest of the world combined. 2,7 This reflects harsh policies implemented by the US President Administration, including mandatory detention of asylum seekers and a dramatic reduction in parole.",
