Badgers play a significant role in the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in some countries and an accurate diagnosis is needed for this infection. However, the lesions of bovine TB are similar to those associated with other pathogens, making pathological diagnosis difficult. In the present study, Streptococcus halichoeri was isolated from a European badger with pyogranulomatous pleuropneumonia and suspected of having tuberculosis. TB and other pathogens able to induce similar lesions were ruled out. Comparative 16S rRNA and rpoB gene sequencing studies showed an identity of 99.51% and 98.28%, respectively, with S. halichoeri. This report represents the third description of this bacterium and the first in an animal species other than the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus). It also shows that S. halichoeri can be associated with a pathological process characterized by granulomatous inflammation and resembling tuberculosis.",

Microscopically, there was severe pyogranulomatous pleuritis and pericarditis (Fig. 1) . Numerous neutrophils, macrophages, some small giant cells, fibrin and, in some areas, neo-vascularization were observed (Fig. 2) . Mesothelial cells were metaplastic showing a rounded morphology (Fig. 2) . The lung showed atelectasis, congestion and haemorrhage, with alveoli occupied by numerous macrophages, some of them with foamy cytoplasm and neutrophils. Mild to moderate proliferative catarrhal bronchiolitis was seen (Fig. 3) . Some airways and blood vessels were surrounded by a slight infiltration of mononuclear cells (Fig. 3) . PAS and ZN stains were both negative.

Other pathogens such as fungi, Nocardia spp., Actinomyces spp. or coronavirus that can induce similar granulomatous lesions were also ruled out. The only significant microbiological finding was a pure culture of S. halichoeri suggesting an aetiological role for this organism. The identification of S. halichoeri was only achieved after molecular studies. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene has become the new 'gold standard' for defining species and genus (Clarridge, 2004) . It has been suggested that a minimum of 99% sequence similarity should be present for species identification, with an ideal value >99.5%. Our results met this criterion; however, for some strains from the Streptococcus genus, the rpoB gene has been proposed as an alternative to 16S rRNA (Vos et al., 2012) . The high similarity observed between the 697 bp rpoB gene fragment sequenced and this gene in two strains of S. halichoeri, strongly support the results obtained in the 16S rRNA analysis.",

Most species are commensals of the upper respiratory tract and lower urinary tract and may cause opportunistic infections, typically of a suppurative nature. In badgers, the only reference of Streptococcus spp. isolation comes from a study of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in which a light growth of alpha and beta-haemolytic streptococci was detected (McCarthy et al., 2009) . S. halichoeri was first reported in UK grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) with skin wounds (Lawson et al., 2004) and, very recently, from a man with empyema (Foo and Chan, 2014) . The occurrence of S. halichoeri in the European badger and the grey seal, two species with a very different way of life, is an interesting finding. One possible explanation for this could be the lack of accurate information about bacterial species in wild carnivores. Additionally, the recent isolation in a human being raises the possibility of a more widespread distribution of S. halichoeri and that this Streptococcus sp. could be an emerging zoonotic infection (Foo and Chan, 2014) .",

Pleuritis and pyothorax are often associated with pneumonic spread from bacteria aspirated from the oropharyngeal microflora. Other routes include haematogenous spread and, less often, bite wounds and perforation of the oesophagus or reticulum (Caswell and Williams, 2007) . In the present case, no external injuries suggesting fighting or accidents during trapping were observed and the origin was suspected to be the aspiration of oropharyngeal flora. Further studies are necessary, however, to confirm if S. halichoeri is a normal inhabitant of the oral mucosa of badgers. On the other hand, respiratory bacterial infections, as often observed with streptococci, are favoured by stress or previous viral infection (Caswell and Williams, 2007) . Canine distemper virus is an important respiratory pathogen in dogs and mustelids, often predisposing to secondary bacterial infections (Barron and Rosenthal, 2012) . Although canine distemper was not identified, the possibility of co-infection with other viral pathogens cannot be excluded. In the present case, the stress of being trapped and handled may have precipitated the disease.",
