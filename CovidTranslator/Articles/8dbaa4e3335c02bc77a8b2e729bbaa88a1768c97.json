The virus titer is determined by counting the number of plaques per well and multiplying the average number of plaques by the final dilution of the virus to give the total pfu per milliliter. 14. The antibody titer is expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution of serum which results in a plaque reduction of 80%, as compared to the virus control.DISCUSSIONA. Cell and organ culture propagation of BCVMebus et al. I22~  in 1973 first demonstrated that a coronavirus-like agent isolated from a calf with diarrhea could be adapted to grow in cell culture. The agent was first isolated in primary fetal bovine kidney cells ~Earle's balanced salt solution, 0.5% lactalbumin hydrolysate, 10% adult bovine serum, antibiotics), then adapted to secondary fetal bovine kidney cells iEarle's 199, 0.5% lactalbumin hydrolysate, 10% adult bovine serum, antibioticst. The virus produced CPE and replicated in these cells as indicated by staining with fluorescein-labeled rabbit gamma globulin against the virus. The typeof CPE observed after 24 passages was a rounding and loss of adherence of cells with formation of syneytia.

CPE first appeared at 3 d as cell rounding, which progressed to cell fusion, monolayer disintegration, and sloughing. After further passages viral yield ranged from 104 to l0 s, 50% tissue culture infective dose ITCIDso)/0.1 ml. CPE could be specifically inhibited by antiserum to BCV and infected cells could be detected by immunofiuorescent staining.Akashi et al. (1 } then utilized this cell line to characterize the Kakegawa isolate of BCV, which had previously been adapted to primary bovine kidney cells. Hirano et al. ~13} showed that the BEK-1 cell line could be used in a plaque assay for the Kakegawa strain of BCV. After a 90-min absorption time and a 48-h incubation period, clear plaques were visible without staining with neutral red. Dea et al. (8} demonstrated that African green monkey kidney (VeroL MDBK, and porcine kidney-15 (PK-15t continuous cell lines (Eagle's minimal essential medium, Earle's salt, 0.584 g of glutamine/liter, with 10, 5, and 3%, respectively, heat-inactivated FBS without gamma-globulinj were satisfactory for the isolation and multiplication of the Mebus strain of BCV. Several field isolates were also cultivated in Vero cells and then adapted to MDBK and primary bovine fetal kidney cells. CPE and positive immunofluorescent staining were observed in all cell lines. CPE consisted of cell rounding, detachment, and complete monolayer destruction after 96 h. Viral yield varied between 10 s and 107 TCIDso/ml. Cells tested in which the virus did not produce CPE were embryonic bovine derma IEBDL embryonic bovine trachea (EBTrL human epitheloid carcinoma lHeLa}, human epidermoid carcinoma lHep-2L African green monkey IBSC-1t, Madin Darby Canine Kidney tMDCKL embryonic lamb kidney ILK}, and mouse L cells.

Hemagglutinating activity peaked at 24 to 48 h postinoculation, whereas immunofluorescence, detected solely in the columnar epithelial cells, was maximal at 24 h. At 2 to 4 d postinoeulation the columnar epithelium lost its normal morphology, becoming irregular and disorganized.

Final remarks Several cell types are permissive for the replication of cell culture-adapted strains of B CV and several cell lines allow the virus to be grown to high titer. Trypsin is useful for enhancing replication of cell cuhure-adapted strains of BCV. Field isolates o f BCV have been propagated in primary bovine kidney and Vero cells. These cell types may be useful for virus isolation or virus quantitation, or both, from diagnostic samples. Several methods have been established for determination of BCV yields from cell or organ culture. These include enumeration of viral particles in culture supernatants by electron microscopy; determination of TCIDso on BEK-1, Vero, MDBK, PK-15, BEL, and HRT-18 cell lines; HA and hemadsorption assays with rat and chicken erythrocytes; direct or indirect immunofluorescent assays; and plaque assays on BEK-1, MDBK, BFT, BFTy, and HRT-18 cells.",

After 24 h, turn speed up to 200 rpm. Allow cells to grow 5 to 6 d. M D B K cells can overgrow very quickly causing the cell layer to peel off. 3. At 5 to 6 d of age, rinse the cell layer once with diluent no. 5 and change media with diluent no. 5 warmed to 37 \u00b0 C, 3 h before inoculation. 4.
