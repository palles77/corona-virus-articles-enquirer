In 2003 more than 8,000 people were infected and over 700 people died because of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Similarly, in 2004, there was national panic when the initial demand for the flu vaccine exceeded its supply and many people who wanted to be vaccinated could not (CBS News, 2004) . Research has shown that children and adults have a difficult time understanding how an individual contracts an infectious disease, what causes these diseases to spread, and how diseases can be prevented Kalish, 1999; Sigelman et al., 1996a) . For these reasons, the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1995) include the study of infectious disease at every grade level from grades 5-12 to increase understanding and help prevent disease spread.",

Several features of participatory simulations are of instructional relevance for learning about infectious disease. For example, in some participatory simulations learners can create online representations of themselves, also called avatars. Also, since some participatory simulations have hundreds of thousands of registered users and thousands of concurrent users, learners can simulate in real time the spread of a disease for a similar duration of a natural disease outbreak.",

In this study, two classes with a total of 46 sixth-grade students became members of Whyville and were able to access the website at home and during science class where they learned about infectious diseases. The students created avatars in Whyville, which experienced the outbreak and spread of a virtual epidemic called Whypox during a 4-week period. When an avatar had the disease, two important aspects of online participation were affected-the avatar's appearance and the ability to chat with other Whyville participants. The feature of having the avatar's appearance change allows users to experience diseases without direct physical harm to the participant, which would be difficult to replicate in real life due to ethical considerations.",

Lastly, we wanted to know how students draw on their participation within a virtual disease simulation in order to expand on their knowledge of natural infectious diseases. The following literature review situates the participation in a virtual epidemic within the larger body of participatory simulations before addressing how participation in a participatory simulation might enhance children's understanding of natural infectious disease.",

For example, in one group of studies in which high school students used wearable computers called Thinking Tags to learn about latency of a virus, probability for infection, and immunity, the students felt that they had experienced a disease (Colella, 2000) . Each Thinking Tag had an infrared transmitter and receiver that exchanged information with the other tags in the simulation and then displayed to the user information such as how many people the Thinking Tag had met that were sick. The Thinking Tags were used within a single classroom and each simulation lasted minutes. Findings from this study showed that with the Thinking Tags, students made references to themselves as being infected and were able to communicate naturally with each other, which seemed to encourage communication about disease. A limitation in this research was that specific assessments of students' learning were not conducted in the study.",

At the time of this study, there were two such environments that included the study of infectious disease-River City and Whyville. The main difference between these two MUVEs was the role of the student's avatar or online representation. In River City (Dede et al., 2002) students learned about how infectious disease spread and the process of scientific inquiry by examining the sanitary conditions and disease spread in the 19th century. Students used their avatars to interview the city's virtual inhabitants and collect data about sanitary conditions within the city but the avatars did not experience the diseases themselves. However, in Whyville, students through their avatars experienced firsthand the outbreak of a virtual epidemic called Whypox.",

We used an existing, thriving participatory simulation that was a MUVE, called Whyville, and integrated the technology use within a classroom curriculum on infectious disease. The main difference between our study and the studies on participatory simulations with wearable or handheld computers (Colella, 2000; Hug et al., 2001) was scale. While these previous studies were conducted in single classrooms where an outbreak lasted only a minute, in Whyville a single outbreak of Whypox could last up to two months depending on the population of Whyville and the chosen disease vector at the time of the outbreak. We believe that the large scale would allow for students to become more fluent with the technical aspects of the medium in addition to providing students with more time to both participate in a virtual disease epidemic and observe its impact. Our study differed from previous research on Whyville in that we wanted to examine how the participation in a virtual disease related to students' understanding of natural disease. Prior research on Whyville focused on how the introduction of the virtual disease and related disease activities on the Whyville site had increased user online discussion about the spread and cure of Whypox (Foley and La Torre, 2004) .",

Of particular interest to the present study was Au and Romo's (1996) model of children's conceptualization of disease because their assessment tools evaluated students' reasoning about what caused disease. Au's research team developed a four-point rubric that was used to assess children's understanding of four biological phenomena: food contamination, illness, genetics, and infectious disease. Children's understanding of each phenomenon was evaluated according to how students reasoned about a scenario. If students included a biological causal explanation, (e.g., a person got sick because germs grew, reproduced, and attacked cells), their response was given a higher score than a response that included only a non-biological cause (e.g., a person got sick because he was not wearing a coat). Like other research (Parmelee, 1992 ), Au's focus on the explicit teaching to children about the causes of infectious disease was based on the assumption that without science instruction, children and adults did not automatically reason coherently about biological phenomena such as the spread of infectious disease. In line with Au's research, children who did not have this science instruction tended to reason about biological phenomena by applying their knowledge of people and everyday observable behaviors to explain the cause.",

In these discussions, the teacher and students discussed a graph that they had created in class that displayed on one axis the number of Whypox infections in both classes and displayed on the other axis the date of infection. The teacher and students used this graphing activity as a springboard to discuss how Whypox was affecting participation in Whyville. A similar graph that displayed the entire Whyville population was available online (see Figure 3 ). The students analyzed these online graphs with teacher guidance. The teacher and students also discussed technical issues about using Whyville such as how to chat and how to participate in activities. In addition to the discussions about Whypox, the teacher guided students in exploring the disease-related activities on Whyville's CDC (see Figure 4 ). At the CDC students read about past cases of Whypox and posted predictions about causes and cures in addition to using tools that simulated outbreaks of diseases by manipulating variables such as the duration of a disease (see Figure 5 ).

Our modification to Au's coding scheme was that during data analyses we collapsed the four-point coding rubric into a binary rubric. We used a binary rubric because in this study we were interested in whether students reasoned with the most sophisticated mechanism of transfer, a biological causal mechanism, or a pre-biological understanding. We were not interested in the degrees of pre-biological understanding that were represented in codes 1 through 3 of Au's original coding scheme.

These terms and concepts included: contagious, exposure, symptoms, infection, incubation period, epidemiologists, epidemic, quarantining, and immunity. Often the students or the teacher mentioned one of these concepts to describe an aspect of their Whypox experience. However, beyond the mere mention of the concept, once mentioned these concepts often became woven into conversations. For example, as the class discussed how they thought they or others got Whypox, a student used the term contagious to paraphrase the teacher's comments of getting Whypox through virtual contact. Then, in a subsequent comment another student used the term contagious to describe how Whypox was affecting her. This conversation allowed for the students to use the term contagious in an authentic situation to hopefully understand what it really meant. The second way of referencing Whypox was through the creation of analogies between Whypox and natural disease, and vice versa. Some of the analogous natural diseases the students and the teacher referenced were SARS, the plague, and the common cold. In these references, of which there were 23 in the selected video segments, the student and the teacher often compared symptoms, preventions, or aspects of Whypox to those experienced in their everyday lives or from their previous studies on natural infectious diseases. These links were used to help students make sense of what was happening with Whypox. In the following example, the teacher responded to a student who thought that she had These links of Whypox to natural infectious diseases, aside from emphasizing a point, may have helped students to think about the virtual infectious disease in ways similar to natural infectious disease. For example, during a class discussion about how students thought they got Whypox, the teacher linked Whypox to natural infectious diseases by making the comparison that the avatars in Whyville were grouped like bacteria.",

In this study, immersiveness appeared in three forms: experiential, social, and causal. In one form, the students and the teacher referenced themselves or others as experiencing an aspect of Whypox, such as ''I saw them with Whypox'' and ''I had it two days ago and it got worse.'' Another way was the social dimension, which involved students noticing others who had Whypox, as illustrated by this student's remarks: ''I was checking there were five people who had Whypox and they were in a room alone.'' The social dimension was rarely seen in isolation of the final form of immersiveness, in which the students and the teacher speculated the causes and spread of Whypox.

We speculated that the large scale of Whyville affected students in ways that prior smaller scale simulations of infectious disease could not. For example, because Whypox lasted several days rather than minutes, students were faced with the reality that Whypox was not going away any time soon. As evidenced by classroom discussions, students interpreted this as a problem since their faces and ability to chat were negatively affected. Because face building and chatting were important activities on Whyville having these activities hampered may have motivated students to look for a cure and ponder possible causes as they did in this study. In addition, students were able to track and compare the spread of the epidemic not only in their two classrooms but also in the whole online community. These observed differences led students to discuss frequency and length of visits in Whyville and forms of interactions with other community members as possible reasons for contracting the disease.",
