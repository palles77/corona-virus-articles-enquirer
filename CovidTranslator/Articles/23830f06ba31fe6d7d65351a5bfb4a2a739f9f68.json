Many Schiff base complexes show excellent catalytic activity in various reactions and in the presence of moisture. Over the past few years, there have been many reports on their applications in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. The high thermal and moisture stabilities of many Schiff base complexes were useful attributes for their application as catalysts in reactions involving at high temperatures. The activity is usually increased by complexation therefore to understand the properties of both ligands and metal can lead to the synthesis of highly active compounds. The influence of certain metals on the biological activity of these compounds and their intrinsic chemical interest as multidentate ligands has prompted a considerable increase in the study of their coordination behaviour. Development of a new chemotherapeutic Schiff bases and their metal complexes is now attracting the attention of medicinal chemists. This review compiles examples of the most promising applied Schiff bases and their complexes in different areas.",

Fe(III), Cu(II), Zn(II) and UO 2 (II) complexes caused inhibition for E. coli. The importance of this lies in the fact that these complexes could be applied fairly in the treatment of some common diseases caused by E. coli. However, Fe(III), Co(II), Cu(II), Zn(II) and UO 2 (II) complexes were specialized in inhibiting Gram-positive bacterial strains (Staphylococcus pyogenes and P. aeruginosa). The importance of this unique property of the investigated Schiff base complexes lies in the fact that, it could be applied safely in the treatment of infections caused by any of these particular strains (Mohamed et al., 2005) . Four Platinum(II) Schiff bases complexes containing of salicylaldehyde and 2-furaldehyde with o-and p-phenylenediamine were reported as antibacterial against E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus. The activity data show that the Platinum(II) complexes are more potent antimicrobials than the parent Schiff base ligands against one or more microorganisms (Gaballa et al., 2007) .",

The newly prepared Schiff base and its metal complexes showed a higher effect on E. coli (Gram-negative bacteria) and S. aureus (Gram-positive bacteria) (Mohamed et al., 2010) . It is known that the membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is surrounded by an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharides. The synthesized Schiff base and its metal complexes seem to be able to combine with the lipophilic layer in order to enhance the membrane permeability of the Gram-negative bacteria. The lipid membrane surrounding the cell favours the passage of only lipid soluble materials; thus the lipophilicity is an important factor that controls the antimicrobial activity. Also the increase in lipophilicity enhances the penetration of Schiff base and its metal complexes into the lipid membranes and thus restricts further growth of the organism (Tumer et al., 1999; Imran et al., 2007; Raman et al., 2009) . The Schiff base and its metal complexes are more toxic on S. aureus than on E. coli, probably due to the sulphonic OH, OCH 3 , S and CH 3 CH 2 CH groups, which might interact with the double membrane (Mohamed et al., 2010) . This activity is related to the nature and structure of the complexes (Fig. 2) .",

The antibacterial activity has been explained on the basis of chelation theory. Also, the results indicated that tested complexes were more active against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria.

Moreover, the stoichiometry and the stability constants of the prepared complexes have been determined spectrophotometrically using continuous variation and molar ratio methods. The obtained results indicated that the Schiff bases of the amino acids: L-alanine, L-phenylalanine, L-histidine and L-arginine behave as tridentate ligands. The ligands are coordinating with the Cu(II) via azomethine nitrogen, deprotonated carboxylate oxygen and phenolic oxygen. While in the case of L-aspartic, the ligand acts as tetradentate due to the coordination of the second carboxylate group. Based on the studies of magnetic moments and electronic spectra, a square planar geometry has been proposed for all Cu(II) complexes except bromosalicylaldehydine aspartate complex which has a distorted tetrahedral structure. The representative Schiff bases and their Cu(II) complexes were tested in vitro for their antibacterial activity against two Gram-Positive bacteria (Micrococcus luteus and B. cereus) and one Gramnegative bacteria (P. aeruginosa). All the complexes showed activity against the organisms more than the free Schiff base ligands and the activity increases with the increase in concentration of test solution containing the new complexes.

However, Co(II) and Mn(II) complexes exhibit less inhibition and VO(II) complexes have no activity towards the microorganisms (Neelakantan et al., 2008) .

The ligands presented here and their transition metal complexes gave better results against the growth of fungi. It is found that the activity increases upon coordination. The increased activity of the metal chelates can be explained on the basis of chelation theory (Raman et al., 2001; Prashanthi et al., 2008) . The orbital of each metal ion is made so as to overlap with the ligand orbital. Increased activity enhances the lipophilicity of complexes due to delocalization of pielectrons in the chelate ring (Srivastava, 1981) . In some cases increased lipophilicity leads to breakdown of the permeability barrier of the cell (Gupta et al., 1997; Cukurovali et al., 2002) . The results of anti-fungal screening, indicate that Cu(II) complexes show more activity than the other complexes. These results may be due to higher stability constant of the Cu(II) complexes than the other complexes.",

It continues as a serious public health problem throughout the world as the most feared diagnosis. It is the second leading cause of human death after cardiovascular diseases in developing as well as in developed countries (Babasaheb et al., 2010) . Currently, the treatment for cancer primarily includes surgery and chemotherapy, but the curative effects of the existing chemotherapeutic drugs are not good enough and they have plentiful side effects. The development of more effective drugs for treating patients with cancer has been a main attempt over the past 50 years. In recent years, various Schiff bases derivatives have been found to be associated with anticancer properties. Five ternary complexes of the rare earth ions with o-phenanthroline and Schiff base salicylaldehyde L-phenylalanine were tested as anti-cancer. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium colorimetry and flow cytometry were used to test the anticancer effect of the complexes with K562 tumour cell. The research showed that the complexes could inhibit K562 tumour cell's growth, generation, and induce apoptosis. The inhibition ratio was accelerated by increasing the dosage, and it had significant positive correlation with the medication dosage. The anticancer activities testing showed that all these complexes exhibited excellent anticancer ability against K562 tumour cell (Dongfang et al., 2008) .",

The Cu(BrHAP) 2 Schiff base compound demonstrated a potent antiproliferative effect in HT-29 cells, with an IC50 value of 2.87 mg/ml after 72 h of treatment. HT-29 cells treated with Cu (II) complexes underwent apoptosis death, as exhibited by a progressive elevation in the proportion of the G1 cell population. At a concentration of 6.25 mg/ml, the Cu(BrHAP) 2 compound caused significant elevation in ROS production following perturbation of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release, as assessed by the measurement of fluorescence intensity in stained cells. Furthermore, the activation of caspases 3/7 and 9 was part of the Cu (II) complexinduced apoptosis, which confirmed the involvement of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Meanwhile, there was no significant activation of caspase-8. Taken together, these results imply that the Cu(BrHAP) 2 compound is a potential candidate for further in vivo and clinical colon cancer studies to develop novel chemotherapeutic agents derived from metal-based agents.

Biological studies such as DNA binding, antioxidant assays and cytotoxic activity were carried out and their anticancer activities were evaluated. Interactions of the complexes with calf thymus DNA revealed that the triphenylphosphine complexes could bind more strongly than the triphenylarsine complexes. The free radical scavenging ability, assessed by a series of in vitro antioxidant assays involving DPPH radical, hydroxyl radical, nitric oxide radical, superoxide anion radical, hydrogen peroxide and metal chelating assay, showed that the Ru(III) complexes possess excellent radical scavenging properties compared to those of Ru(II).

Carrageen an-induced paw oedema (CIPO) and histamine induced paw oedema (HIPO) methods were used to determine the anti-inflammatory activity of commercial sample of 4APZ and its synthesized Schiff bases in mice. The anti-inflammatory activity was in the order of 4APZAB > 4APZBB > 4APZCB > 4APZVn and all the test compounds exhibited considerable dose dependent inhibition of the paw oedema. The effect of the compounds on membrane stabilization was also determined which showed that compounds 4APZ (120 and 240 mg/kg doses), 4APZAB (160 mg/kg) and 4APZVn (600 mg/kg) produced highly significant inhibition (P < 0.001) of hypotonicity-induced haemolysis. Further, it was also observed that 4APZ (120 and 240 mg/ kg doses), 4APZBB (500 mg/kg) and APZCB (150, 300 and 600 mg/kg dose) produced highly significant inhibition (P < 0.001) of albumin denaturation; a consistent dose dependent anti-inflammatory effect of test compounds as compared to the standard drug. Analgesic activity of the compounds was investigated by formalin-induced paw licking (FIPL) and acetic acid-induced writhing (AIW) methods in mice. It was observed that 4APZ (240 mg/kg), 4APZAB (160 mg/kg), 4APZBB (500 mg/ kg), 4APZCB (600 mg/kg) and 4APZVn (600 mg/kg) showed analgesic effect with highly significant (P < 0.001) reduction of paw licking and writhing activity in the treated mice. The order of analgesic effect of the compounds was 4APZAB > 4APZBB > 4APZVn > 4APZCB. Moreover, phenobarbitone-induced sleeping time (PIST) in mice was also studied but only 600 mg/kg of 4APZVn significantly increased the duration of induced sleep which also suggested its sedative property. Brewer's yeast was used to induce fever in rabbits and analyzed the compounds for their antipyretic activity. Different doses of 4APZ for different time durations (240 mg/ kg-after 1 h, 120 and 240 mg/kg doses-after 2 h) produced highly significant (P < 0.001) inhibition of hyperpyrexia. Other compounds showed good antipyretic activity after 2, 3 and 4 h (Murtaza et al., in press ).",

The solution diluted with saturated sodium chloride solution and extracted with ethyl acetate, dried by magnesium sulphate, solvent was removed under reduced pressure to give a crude product which was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (ethyl acetate/petroleum ether 1:15). This method offers several advantages such as high yield of product, short reaction time, simple work up procedures and environmental friendly. Further work is in progress to extrapolate the catalytic activity of Schiff base complex to other organic transformation (Yang et al., 2011) .",

Some metal complexes are used to mass dye polyfibers (Kaul, 1985) . Cobalt complex of a Schiff base (salicylaldehyde with diamine) has excellent light resistance and storage ability and does not degrade even in acidic gases (CO 2 ). Novel tetradentate Schiff base acts as a chromogenic reagent for determination of Ni in some natural food samples (Fakhari et al., 2005) . Four new azo dyes L1, L2, L3 and L4, were prepared by linking benzaldehyde p-aminobenzoylhydrazone (3), phydroxybenzaldehyde p-amino-benzoylhydrazone (4), naphthaldehyde p-aminobenzoylhydrazone (5) and p-methoxybenzaldehyde p-aminobenzoylhydrazone (6) to resorcinol and through diazo-coupling reactions. Mixed-ligand dinuclear complexes with general stoichiometry [Cu 2 L(amino antipy.) 2 ] Cl 2 (11, 12, 13 and 14) was synthesized from azo ligands and bidentate ligand (4-aminoantipyrine) with copper.
