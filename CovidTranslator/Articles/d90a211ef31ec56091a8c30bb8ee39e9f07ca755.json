It has been suggested that MERS-CoV surveillance may be better in high-income countries than in lower-income countries (6) . We tested this hypothesis by comparing the frequency of case detection among travelers returning to high-income We conducted sensitivity analyses in which we included 1) laboratory-confirmed cases among travelers for whom it was unclear in which country they had been infected or if they had been infected by another travel-associated case-patient and 2) probable but non-laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported in travelers. These analyses indicated there could have been up to 4,895 severe cases across source countries (95% CI 2,352-8,824). We also conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of uncertainty of travelers' average length of stay in source countries ( Table 2; online  Technical Appendix Tables 2, 3) . Increases in travelers' assumed lengths of stay produced lower cumulative incidence estimates related to lower estimated infection rates, and decreases in travelers' assumed lengths of stay produced higher case estimates. For example, using data for travelers from high-income nations, a 2-day increase in average length of stay produced estimates of 2,326 severe cases across source countries (95% CI 924-4,714; online Technical Appendix Table 2 ), and a 2-day decrease in lengths of stay produced estimates of 5,463 severe cases (95% CI 2,171-11,071).",

Our sensitivity analyses demonstrated that results are sensitive to travelers' estimated lengths of stay and also showed that estimates of the epidemic size that incorporated data from lower-income countries were 60% lower than estimates obtained by using data from high-income countries alone. This finding implies different levels of case detection across travelers' home countries or different MERS-CoV exposure between visitors of different nationalities. Additional data (e.g., larger sample size, travel volume, and lengths of stay, stratified by age and immigration status, frequencies of testing, and contact with camels) could provide further estimates. Public health officials are concerned about MERS-CoV, both in the source countries and from exported cases in persons who can seed outbreaks elsewhere (9, 11) . By better estimating the epidemic size in the Middle East, our results can help guide public health preparedness efforts in source countries and contribute to projections of the number of cases that could occur among travelers (9, (11) (12) (13) .",
