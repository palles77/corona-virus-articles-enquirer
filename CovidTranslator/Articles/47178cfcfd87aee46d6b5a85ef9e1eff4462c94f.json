However, most of the diagnostic methods available today, such as real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), require a second detection method for confirmation because they detect a single sequence region of the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). For sensitive and accurate early diagnosis, we report a novel assay system combining multiplex RT-PCR and a diagnostic gene chip to detect multiple virusspecific genomic sequences of SARS-CoV. With 53 clinical specimens, we successfully demonstrate that this technique offers not only a high-accuracy diagnosis for early SARS infection but also a semiquantitative assay.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a novel worldwide infectious disease, caused by a newly identified coronavirus, SARS-CoV. [1] [2] [3] As this disease is rapidly spreading with a relatively high mortality rate (close to 10%), and tends to spread within hospitals or communities, accurate diagnosis in the early course of illness and isolation of suspect cases for appropriate clinical care becomes the best strategy for the control of possible recurrent SARS outbreaks. 4 However, the viral dynamics and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV in vivo has mostly remained unknown. It is believed that the incubation period of SARS can range from 2 to 16 days before the onset of symptoms, and the viral load during the first week of the illness is low. 5 Therefore, the disease stage of the patient may greatly affect the diagnostic accuracy of a chosen assay. Serological testing has been shown to be very reliable for confirmation of the diagnosis of SARS-CoV. To date, there are two prevailing serological diagnostic methods, enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) 6, 7 and indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA), 6, 8 which are very suitable for the SARS diagnosis while the virus titer is relatively high in convalescent phase. 3 For early diagnosis, which is critical for the control of disease spread, real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) becomes the prevailing option because of its higher sensitivity for the detection of a lower virus titer in the early infection. 9 Nonetheless, this PCR-based assay only identifies one region of the SARS-CoV sequence per reaction. As suggested by the WHO (http:// www.who.int/csr/sars/diagnostictests/en/) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/labdiagnosis.htm), the detection of more than one genome region with different primer sets (or by another diagnostic method) is required to confirm the SARS infection. To overcome this limitation, the multiplex RT-PCR (MRT-PCR) seems to be a good alternative because it can simultaneously detect multiple target sequence regions of a pathogen genome in one assay. For several respiratory infectious diseases, this method has been reported useful in detecting viruses, 10 such as influenza, [11] [12] [13] parainfluenza, 14, 15 and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV). 12, 15 However, some practical problems, including poor sensitivity and specificity, limit this method as a general diagnostic tool.",

Notably, the SCP1 and SCP3 probes are capable of detecting the PCR products with as few as a theoretically single copy of starting SARS-CoV RNA. In contrast, the SCP2 appears to be less efficient in detecting low titer virus (o10 2 copies), suggesting that the design of the SC2 primer pair for RT-PCR amplification and/or the SCP2 probe for hybridization was not optimized for detection of trace virus. On the other hand, we also noted that the fluorescent signals of SCP1 and SCP3 plateaued early at low virus titer, whereas that of SCP2 seems to exert a wider linear dynamic range; a result that suggests that SCP2 is valuable for quantitative assay. In the same chip, we also noted that the RTCP control probe showed invariant signal magnitude to the constant input of control target (Figure 1c) , thus making it a useful normalization standard for semiquantification assay.",

In this study, throat swabs were randomly selected from 53 different patients who were either suspect or probable SARS cases in the Center for Disease Control, Taiwan. The definition of suspect or probable cases relies upon WHO criteria (http:// www.who.int/csr/sars/casedefinition/en/). For example, a suspect case of SARS has high fever (4381C), symptoms of cough or breathing difficulty, and has history of exposure or contact with person who is a suspect or probable case of SARS. In our study, the probable cases, which may represent people who had similar symptoms with those of suspect cases except the history of contact is not clear, were also included in the sampling pool. All cases were tested in single-blinded manner. In addition to chip-based assay, all specimens were analyzed in parallel by single-round RT-PCR (Artus), real-time nested PCR, 17 and subsequently confirmed by seroconversion unless convalescent sera were not available due to the fatal cases or sera were only collected at acute phase. Table 2 summarizes the accuracy of different diagnostic methods. Both the chip-based assay and real-time nested PCR detected 18 positive cases in 53 clinical specimens. In contrast, only 15 cases were identified as SARS-CoV-positive and three were missed by the single-round RT-PCR. Interestingly, we determined that these three missed samples contained o10 copies of viral genome in the test of real-time nested PCR, suggesting that the gene chip is a sensitive method to detect SARS-CoV in early infection. For those three cases missed by single-round RT-PCR (Artus) and another eight positive cases (total 11 out of 18 positive cases), infection was confirmed by seroconversion ( Table 2) .",

We tested 53 clinical specimens and demonstrate that the gene chip can accurately detect SARS-CoV. This assay is highly specific and sensitive and is applicable to clinical samples. Our findings suggest several advantages over conventional single-round real-time RT-PCR. First, the chip-based assay is highly sensitive for detection of trace virus in early infection. We have shown that the detection sensitivity of chip-based assay (o10 copies of SARS-CoV) is better than, or at least comparable to, the single-round real-time RT-PCR method for diagnosis of clinical specimens. Second, the gene chip-based diagnosis is highly specific. It requires hybridization with multiple sequence-specific probes (three virus-specific and three control probes on our gene chip) to allow for specific detection of virus targets of more than one genome region. Therefore, the gene chip assay not only specifically identifies the SARS-CoV but also simultaneously confirms the diagnosis in one assay, thus reducing the false-positive and false-negative results. In contrast, conventional single-round realtime RT-PCR can only detect one virus-specific sequence per reaction without stringent hybridization with probes. Third, this assay is simple and rapid. The entire assay, including MRT-PCR and chip-based assays, can be easily completed within 6 h, including a 3-h MRT-PCR followed by a 3-h gene chip analysis, thereby making it a clinical applicable alternative for screening of SARS-CoV in laboratories that are not equipped with a real-time PCR instrument. Although this diagnosis method requires a 3-h post-PCR process for gene chip detection, it is a more time-efficient and cost-effective assay, because this gene chip can concurrently identify the virus target and confirm the diagnosis result. Last and perhaps most importantly, one may expand the present gene chip to simultaneously detect other related coronaviruses or multiple respiratory pathogens in one assay. SARS is an acute pneumonic illness and is clinically difficult to distinguish from other types of atypical pneumonia in the absence of a clear epidemiological link to other patients with the disease. The major advantage of gene chip diagnosis is that one can add to this system a large number of alternative pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonia with little modification.",
