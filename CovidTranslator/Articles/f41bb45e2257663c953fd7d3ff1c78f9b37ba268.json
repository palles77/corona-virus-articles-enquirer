In this article, we undertake a systematic review of the study design, statistical analyses, and outcomes of the many social contact surveys that have been published. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed and Web of Science for articles regarding social contact surveys. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines as closely as possible. Results: In total, we identified 64 social contact surveys, with more than 80% of the surveys conducted in high-income countries. Study settings included general population (58%), schools or universities (37%), and health care/conference/research institutes (5%). The largest number of studies did not focus on a specific age group (38%), whereas others focused on adults (32%) or children (19%). Retrospective (45%) and prospective (41%) designs were used most often with 6% using both for comparison purposes. The definition of a contact varied among surveys, e.g., a nonphysical contact may require conversation, close proximity, or both. We identified age, time schedule (e.g., weekday/weekend), and household size as relevant determinants of contact patterns across a large number of studies. Conclusions: We found that the overall features of the contact patterns were remarkably robust across several countries, and irrespective of the study details. By considering the most common approach in each aspect of design (e.g., sampling schemes, data collection, definition of contact), we could identify recommendations for future contact data surveys that may be used to facilitate comparison between studies.",

            "text": "transmission parameters (i.e., who infects whom?). The latter are the most influential drivers for the outputs of such models. Whereas 20th-century models made strong assumptions about mixing patterns, it has become increasingly common to use empirical data on social interactions as a direct model input over the last decade. 2, 3 For sexually transmitted infections, data from surveys on sexual behavior were available for use as an input for models. On the other hand, for infectious diseases that are transmitted by direct contact, minimal data on relevant social contacts was available. Edmunds et al 4 conducted a first study aimed to collect precisely this information using a convenience sample. This study was followed by a study that reported on relevant social contacts in a representative sample of the population that covered all ages in a city. 5 The landmark study that reported on relevant social contacts in representative samples for eight different European countries using contact diaries was the POLYMOD study. 6 Numerous other studies have been reported since. Several of these studies report on social mixing patterns as obtained through direct observation, contact diaries, or electronic proximity sensors. The strengths and weaknesses of these methods have been discussed. 7 Nevertheless, to our knowledge, a comprehensive review of the study designs for contact diaries and of major determinants of mixing patterns is lacking for this rapidly growing field of research, a gap which we aim to fill here.",

The response rate was reported in 36 out of 64 surveys and ranged from 4% in population-based surveys 26 up to 100% in a school-based survey. 17 Of these 34 surveys, only three considered the response rate beforehand to estimate the sample size. 15, 38, 47 Instead of considering the response rate, some surveys established criteria to replace those who refused or were not reached after several attempts.

In addition, 10 surveys relied on quota sampling, which aimed to represent certain characteristics of a population ( e.g., age, sex, geography, etc). Of these surveys, nine were conducted at the whole-country level, 6, 13, 32 and one survey focused on one specific region. 36 In addition, one survey used mixed samplings, in which a convenience sample of students was obtained in two schools, and a random sample of the general population was obtained in one province. 33 Five surveys used an online respondent-driven method, which can be considered as a snowball or chain sampling technique. 31, 45, 60 Only one survey did not state information on sampling techniques. 34 Finally, three surveys conducted at the general population level used a convenience sample, 29, 44, 50 therefore not relying on a sampling frame.

To compare these survey results, we categorized them into 12 groups with different extents of representativeness (for country, region, or town or city), study designs and settings. In country-wide prospective surveys, the average number of contacts ranges from a minimum of 7.95 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 7. 61, 8.29) in Germany 6 to a maximum of 26.97 (95% CI = 25.05 , 28.89 ) in the United Kingdom. 26 In country-wide retrospective surveys, these values ranges from 12.5 (95% CI = 12.09 , 12.91) in Taiwan 38 to 15.3 (95% CI = 14.4 , 16.3 ) in Japan. 37 Six surveys conducted in the general population asked participants not to report details of professional contacts in the diary but to provide an estimate of the number and age distribution if they had more than 10 contacts (surveys in Finland, 6 Germany, 6 and the Netherlands 6 ) or more than 20 professional contacts (surveys in Belgium 6, 12 and France 13 ). The additional professional contacts are not included in calculation of means presented in Figure 3 . Among school-or university-based surveys, the highest number of contacts ( 70.3 [95% CI = 63.23 , 77.37 ]) was observed in a secondary school in the United Kingdom. 23 Figure 4 presents the number of surveys that have analyzed possible determinants for the number of contacts. For every determinant, we report the number of surveys that identified a relevant connection with the number of contacts (\"yes\"), the number of surveys that did not identify such a connection (\"no\") and the number of surveys that did not delve into the matter. Strong evidence is identified for whether the age (34 yes vs. five no) and the household size (21 yes vs. four no) of the participant affected the number of contacts. Only five surveys identified sex as a relevant indicator for the number of social contacts, in contrast to 23 surveys that did not identify a relation. Social contacts are also affected by the daily routine (29 yes vs. six no) with a larger number of contacts during weekdays compared with the weekend (eFigure 6a; http://links.lww.com/ EDE/B552 with the exception of Ref. 36) . Similar results hold for term time versus holidays with all of the eight surveys that analyzed the issue identifying a larger number of contacts during term time (eFigure 6b; http://links.lww.com/EDE/B552). In addition, a self-reported healthy status is associated (five yes vs. one no) with a larger number of contacts with respect to feeling ill (eFigure 6c; http://links.lww.com/EDE/B552).",

Given the lack of a clear picture regarding which demographic and anthropologic factors are relevant in shaping contact patterns, inherent factors that may drive contact patterns are difficult to account for, thus making comparison among large populations, e.g., countries, even more difficult. It should be noted, however, that this is a relevant issue only when considering the contact matrix. Given the intrinsic network nature of social contact data more in general, sample size calculation becomes more involved and relies heavily on assumptions about the structural characteristic of the network and that no standard method to do so has emerged so far. 63, 64 Indeed, the extensive analysis of this review has underlined a general lack of information on response rates, and a call for a better nonresponse analysis emerges as a guideline for future studies.",

On the other hand, face-toface interviews are more demanding in terms of fieldwork and data collection. No clear relationship in the number of contacts has been found when comparing online diaries with paper diaries, 10, 36 while proximity sensors are more accurate in measuring short duration contacts, with the overall interaction pattern being similar between sensor and diaries 18, 56 (for more details about data collection, see eAppendix; http:// links.lww.com/EDE/B552). It should also be noted that proximity sensors usually perform a complete sampling of the interaction networks, whereas diary-based survey usually implement egocentric sampling (but complete sampling is not excluded in principle 14, 35, 39, 44 ) . Although egocentric sampling does not allow estimation of several important network features, it still does not bias inference results, if properly taken into account. 65, 66 The definition of a potentially infectious contact is of crucial importance given that it will be used as a surrogate for exposure to disease. 15 Contact definitions in most surveys cannot capture potential risks from all forms of transmission modes, 30 such as fomite or indirect contact. Even for droplet transmission, using a face-to-face conversation definition as the basis for recording nonphysical contacts might lead to underreporting potentially infectious events given that susceptible individuals are likely able to contract a respiratory infection by just standing next to infected individuals who are, for example, sneezing or coughing. Furthermore, it seems even more challenging to record common touching frequency of shared material objects, such as doorknobs, water taps, etc., with which one person may be able to infect another indirectly. Indeed, the more details on potentially infectious events we attempt to collect, the greater the burden we impose on respondents. However, it seems reasonable in future studies to consider at least two contact definitions, one that involves physical contact and one that does not.",

In addition, the more contacts they reported on the first day, the larger the proportional decrease in number of contacts on the second day.

In the case of school-aged children, a dominant number of contacts are made in school, leading to an indication that school closure can have a substantial impact on the spread of a respiratory infection. 3, 20, 23, 70, 71 Duration and frequency of contacts are important because they affect the probability of infecting another individual and if all contacts are treated equally, this may lead to wrongfully estimating the individual transmission probability. 29 Several studies found that close contacts with a duration of at least 15 minutes involving skin-to-skin touching were most predictive of the prevaccination prevalence of varicella zoster virus. 68, 72 Therefore, the age of the contactee and duration of contact emerge as the most important information and should always be recorded in social contact surveys. A comparison among all surveys based on a quantity such as the average number of contacts can be problematic. The study sample serves as the first obstacle. Given different research questions or participant availability, not all the samples studied can be considered as representative of the target population. This notion is important especially because age is a relevant determinant of social contacts, and samples in which a specific age class is over-represented regardless of study design can induce a strong bias to the number of contacts measured. For example, the study reporting the largest number of contacts (70.3 23 ) was performed in a secondary school in the United Kingdom. Once these caveats are taken into account, the Table can be of value in identifying all of the surveys sharing similar features when addressing a specific research question. For example, the POLYMOD survey 6 demonstrated that the main structure of social interaction among age categories was the same among several European Union countries, although the strength of the interaction could vary between countries. On the other hand, the average number of contacts measured in sub-Saharan countries by Dodd et al 41 is considerably reduced compared with the average for highincome countries. In fact, the development level can be important in determining social interactions, e.g., due to local population density or reduced school attendance. 43, 44, 72 Quantifying the impact of different demographic factors on social contacts would require re-analysis of the datasets on the same basis and goes beyond the scope of this review. However, this could be performed in the future as datasets of social contact surveys will be made available from researchers in a unified format. 73 This review used PubMed and Web of Knowledge for searching publications, possibly resulting in the omission of relevant publications. Nonetheless, the literature research step allowed us to recover more articles independently of a specific database, possibly recovering the ones we lost querying only two databases. Second, to the best of our knowledge, our search query failed to return the relevant articles of Leecaster et al 58 and Kwok et al, 74 which are eligible for this review. These articles are missing the words \"survey\", \"questionnaire\", and \"diary\" in the abstract and title, and therefore were missed by our searching method. The recent publication date (2016 and 2018) also prevented these articles from appearing in the references of the relevant articles. Another article that requires a specific clarification is the work of Watson et al 75 that asked participants to record whom they shared a meal with. This article was not included in our analysis, as considering a definition of social contact that is rather different from the body of this review.",
