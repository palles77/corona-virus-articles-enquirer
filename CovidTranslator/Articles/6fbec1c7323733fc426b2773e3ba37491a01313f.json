They are prevalent and tend to affect those who are more vulnerable, such as children, elderly, and people living in developing areas, such as sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. 1 The advent of molecular techniques has facilitated the identification of respiratory viruses in patients with pneumonia and has shed a light on how commonly these viruses occur in patients with pneumonia. With the currently available diagnostic tools, viral pathogens are more often identified than bacterial pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia. 2 A large amount of effort is currently being dedicated to elucidate the pathogenicity of respiratory viruses and the interaction between viruses and bacteria in the setting of pneumonia.",

The capsid has a large cleft (or canyon) that binds to adhesion molecules on the cell surface, leading to the eventual entry of the viral genome into the cell. The capsid and the adhesion molecules are potential targets of antivirals 17, 18 (Table 1) .",

Although the presence of a viral infection did not significantly increase the risk of shortterm death, patients with dual bacterial-viral infection had twice the risk of death as compared with patients without dual infection. 19 It is important to note that the identification of a viral pathogen in a patient with pneumonia does not necessarily mean that the virus has a pathogenic effect, particularly if the identification is via nasopharyngeal swab ( Fig. 1 , Table 2 ).",

            "text": "In immunocompromised patients with pneumonia, infection by respiratory viruses is exceedingly common. Surveillance studies show that a respiratory viral pathogen is identified in close to a third of hospitalized patients with leukemia or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and respiratory symptoms. Pneumonia occurs in most immunosuppressed patients infected with a respiratory viral pathogen. 23 Immunocompromised patients are commonly infected by the same respiratory viruses that cause infection in immunocompetent patients. However, viruses of the Herpesviridae family also tend to cause infection in immunocompromised patients. As an example, in an early series of patients who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, cytomegalovirus was the most common viral pathogen. 24 Varicella zoster virus reactivation can occur in patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with early series reporting incidences ranging from 22% to 41%. 25, 26 It is not unusual for the infection to present in a disseminated form in these patients, and pneumonia is one of the complications. [25] [26] [27] Epidemiology of Hospital-Acquired Viral Respiratory Infection Traditionally, hospital-acquired respiratory viral infection has been thought to be limited to immunocompromised patients. However, it is now known that this can also commonly occur in immunocompetent patients. This was highlighted by a prospective cohort study that included 262 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia. The proportion of viral infection was 36.1% in immunocompromised patients and 11.2% in non-immunocompromised patients. The identified viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (6.1%), parainfluenza virus (6.1%), influenza virus (3.8%), cytomegalovirus (1.9%), human coronavirus (1.5%), bocavirus (0.8%), human metapneumovirus (0.8%), and adenovirus (0.4%). 28 These data underscore the importance of infection control measures in patients with pneumonia. 29 In 2003, a major outbreak of atypical pneumonia was reported. The cases initially clustered in China but were subsequently reported worldwide. The pneumonia often resulted in acute respiratory failure and was named severe acute respiratory syndrome. 30 Subsequently, the etiologic agent of this disease was identified as a novel coronavirus, 31, 32 which was named the Urbani strain of severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus. 31 In 2012, another novel coronavirus was isolated from a patient with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia. 33 The virus was subsequently named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. 34 Infection by this virus causes an illness that is clinically similar to that caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus but with higher mortality. 35 Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus were initially reported in Saudi Arabia but were subsequently reported in other countries, including the United States, typically in persons who had traveled from the Arabian Peninsula. [36] [37] [38] Influenza The incidence of influenza can vary substantially in different seasons. As an example, using online surveillance data, it was estimated that the influenza attack rate for adults aged 20 to 64 years old was 30.5% (95% CI 4.4-49.3) in the 2012 to 2013 season and 7.1 (95% CI \u00c05.1 to 32.5) in the 2013 to 2014 season. 39 The rates of influenza-associated hospitalization per 100,000 persons varied from 4.8 to 18.7 in 3 different seasons in the United States. 40 Different studies showed that approximately one-third of hospitalized patients with laboratoryconfirmed influenza have pneumonia. [41] [42] [43] In a study that included 4765 patients hospitalized with influenza, those with pneumonia were older 43 During an influenza season, the attributed mortality to pneumonia and influenza in the United States ranges from 5.6% to 11.1%. 44 In a cohort study that included laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza admitted to the hospital, those with pneumonia, as compared with those without pneumonia, were more likely to require intensive care unit (ICU) admission (27% vs 10%) and mechanical ventilation (18% vs 5%), and to die (9% vs 2%) 42 (Fig. 2 ).",

A study prospectively followed 2 outpatient cohorts during 4 seasons: 608 heathy elderly patients and 540 high-risk adults. High-risk status was defined as the presence of congestive heart failure or chronic pulmonary disease. Respiratory syncytial virus infection was diagnosed in 3% to 7% of healthy elderly subjects and 4% to 10% of highrisk subjects. This accounted for 1.5 respiratory syncytial virus infections per 100 person-months in high-risk adults and 0.9 in healthy elderly subjects. 45 In an analysis of hospitalization and viral surveillance data that encompassed several years, it was estimated that the respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalization rate per 100,000 person-years in the United States was 12.8 (95% CI 2.4-73.9) for patients age 50 to 64 years old and 86.1 (95% CI 37.3-326.2) for patients aged !65 years old. In contrast to influenzaassociated hospitalizations, the rates of respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalizations were relatively similar across the years. 46 In a cohort of 1388 hospitalized adults older than 65 years or with underlying cardiopulmonary diseases, respiratory syncytial virus infection was diagnosed in 8% to 13% of these patients depending on the year. Of the 132 hospitalized patients with respiratory syncytial virus infection, 41 (31%) had an infiltrate on chest radiograph, 20 (15%) required ICU admission, 17 (13%) required mechanical ventilation, and 10 (8%) died. 45 ",

The adenovirus species found in immunocompromised patients are not typically found in the community, which indicates endogenous viral reactivation in these patients. 54 No clear seasonality, although cases may spike in some months. 55 A number of outbreaks caused by adenovirus have been reported.

            "text": "Patients with influenza infection in general (not just pneumonia) commonly present with cough, fever, fatigue, myalgia, runny nose, and sweating. Wheezing as a symptom can occur in close to half of the patients. 72 Patients with influenza pneumonia tend to have the same symptoms as patients with nonpneumonic influenza infection but an important distinction is that patients with pneumonia more often have dyspnea. 73 Perhaps the greatest clinical clue for influenza in a patient with acute respiratory symptoms (or pneumonia) is whether the patient is presenting during an influenza epidemic. As an example, the absence of coughing and temperature higher than 37.8 C make influenza very unlikely in patients presenting with influenzalike illness outside an influenza epidemic but has a lesser impact on the likelihood of influenza if the same patient presenting during an epidemic. On the other hand, the presence of these symptoms during an epidemic substantially increases the probability of influenza but has a lesser impact outside of an epidemic. 74 Studies have assessed the accuracy of clinical manifestations for the diagnosis of influenza in patients with acute respiratory symptoms. Some of the earlier studies were limited by retrospective design, leading to potential classification bias, or by the reliance on clinical manifestations for the final diagnosis of influenza, leading to incorporation bias. 75 More recent studies used a prospective design and viral polymerase chain reaction test as the reference standard. A prospective study enrolled 100 patients with influenzalike illness who presented to 3 different clinics. Viral polymerase chain reaction test was used for the diagnosis of influenza. The accuracy of a number of symptoms was tested. On multivariate analysis, only cough and temperature remained significant predictors of influenza. 76 In a prospective study of 258 patients who presented to the emergency department with acute respiratory symptoms, a symptom inventory and influenza polymerase chain reaction test was applied to the patients. Using polymerase chain reaction test as the reference standard, the accuracy of clinical judgment, decision rule, and rapid influenza test was provided. The presence of cough and fever had a positive likelihood ratio of 5.1 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.7. 72 In a prospective study of 270 highrisk patients who presented to an emergency department with acute respiratory illness, clinicians were asked whether they thought the patient had influenza. Viral polymerase chain reaction was the reference standard. A clinician diagnosis of influenza had a positive likelihood ratio of 1.63 and negative likelihood ratio of 0.82. 77 Likelihood ratios are an interesting way of providing the accuracy of symptoms or clinical diagnosis because they allow for the estimate of the probability of a disease after taking into account the pre-test probability 78 (Fig. 3) . See Table 3 for a summary of these studies. Overall, the previously described studies indicate that the predictive value of symptoms, combination of symptoms, or clinical impression for the diagnosis of influenza is only modest for patients presenting with acute illness. Symptoms or clinical impression are not enough to rule in or rule out influenza. In fact, clinicians failed to clinically diagnose influenza in approximately two-thirds of influenza-confirmed patients in a prospective series. 77 Ultimately, clinicians need to pay close attention to surveillance data, and if there is evidence of influenza activity in the area where they practice, any acute febrile respiratory illness should place influenza as a high possibility in the differential diagnosis. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide weekly data on influenza activity according to regions in the country. This is available at https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm. Other important aspects of clinical history include close contact with persons with acute febrile illness, and recent travel. Additionally, it is important to realize that in some tropical countries, influenza circulates throughout the year. 79 A hallmark of respiratory syncytial virus infection is the presence of wheezing, which occurs in a higher frequency as compared with patients with influenza. Hospitalized patients with respiratory syncytial virus infection may present with clinicalradiological dissociation, in which patients may appear toxemic despite mild radiological abnormalities. In a cohort of 118 hospitalized patients with respiratory syncytial virus infection, the most common symptoms were cough (97%), dyspnea (95%), wheezing (73%), and nasal congestion (68%). On physical examination, wheezing was present in 82% of the patients. A temperature higher than 39 C was present in only 13% of the patients. It should be noted, however, that these percentages are for all hospitalized patients with respiratory syncytial virus infection. When assessing only those hospitalized patients with respiratory syncytial virus infection and pneumonia, wheezing and nasal congestion were less common. 80 In another study of 57 patients with respiratory syncytial virus infection and clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, the most common symptoms were cough (88%), dyspnea (82%), wheezing (79%), fever (61%), and runny nose (58%). On physical examination, the most common findings were wheezing (53%), rhonchi (46%), and crackles (40%). 81 Just as in pneumonia caused by influenza or respiratory syncytial virus, there are no specific clinical manifestations of pneumonia caused by other respiratory viruses. In fact, symptoms and signs are not specific enough to differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia. 82 The usual clinical manifestations of pneumonia, including fever higher than 37.8 C, heart rate faster than 100 beats per minute, crackles, and decreased breath sounds, 83 are to be expected in pneumonia caused by any of the respiratory viruses. In the end, the diagnosis of viral infection in patients with pneumonia relies on the recognition that respiratory viruses are a common etiology of pneumonia, and on the systematic performance of viral microbiology studies on these patients.",

            "text": "The 2 main classes of antiviral drugs for treatment of influenza include neuraminidase inhibitors and adamantanes. 7 Influenza viruses infect cells through the binding of its surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin to the sialic acid receptor. The attached virus is then released into the cells by another surface glycoprotein, neuraminidase, which is the target of neuraminidase inhibitors. 88 The adamantanes, which include amantadine and rimantadine, block the M2 protein, a membrane protein with ion channel activity. 89 They exhibit activity against influenza A but not against influenza B. The antiviral drugs currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration are the neuraminidase inhibitors oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, and intravenous peramivir. 90 The adamantanes are not recommended for the treatment of influenza because of high resistance of influenza A against these drugs. 90 There are a number of clinical trials that assessed the effect of oseltamivir for influenza. A comprehensive systematic review summarized the effect of oseltamivir for prophylaxis and treatment in adults and children. For the assessment of time to alleviation of symptoms in adults with influenza, 8 studies were pooled, totaling 2208 patients in the oseltamivir group and 1746 in the placebo group. Oseltamivir led to earlier relief of symptoms (16.8 hours; 95% CI 8.4-25.1 hours; P < .001). For the assessment of pneumonia prevention in adults with influenza, 8 studies were pooled, which included 2694 patients in the oseltamivir group and 1758 in the placebo group. Oseltamivir led to a reduction in pneumonia (risk difference of 1% [0.22%-1.49%]). For the assessment of hospitalization prevention in adults with influenza, 7 studies were pooled that included 2663 patients in the oseltamivir group and 1731 in the placebo group. There was no difference in need for hospitalization (risk ratio 0.92; 95% CI 0.57-1.5; P 5 .73). The pooling of 8 studies in adults, which included 2694 patients in the oseltamivir group and 1758 in the control group, showed that oseltamivir led to more nausea (risk ratio 1.57; 95% CI 1.14-2.15; P 5 .005) and more vomiting (risk ratio 2.43; 95% CI 1.75-3.38; P<.001]). 91 In aggregate, these meta-analyses indicate that influenza-infected patients treated with oseltamivir have a modest benefit in relief of symptoms and prevention of pneumonia. This comes at the expense of more nausea and vomiting. It should be noted, however, that the patients included in these trials did not appear ill. For instance, studies that enrolled patients with immunosuppressive conditions such as human immunodeficiency virus infection or malignancy were not included in the meta-analyses. The inclusion criteria for the pooled studies were the presence of influenzalike illness rather than pneumonia. Additionally, only 1 death was reported among all trials that included the adult population.",

Antiviral treatment for pneumonia caused by viruses of the Herpesviridae family in immunocompetent hosts has been reported in severe cases. 98, 99 In pregnant women with varicella zoster virus pneumonia, the mortality is high, and treatment with intravenous acyclovir is indicated. 100 In immunosuppressed patients, aerosolized ribavirin, oral ribavirin, intravenous immunoglobulin, hyperimmunoglobulin, and palivizumab are treatment options that have been used in respiratory syncytial virus infection, particularly in patients with hematological malignancy or transplant recipients. 101 For cytomegalovirus pneumonia, treatment includes intravenous ganciclovir. 102 The addition of cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin to ganciclovir appears to lead to improved survival according to a case series. 103 An alternative treatment for cytomegalovirus pneumonia is intravenous foscarnet. 104 For the treatment of varicella pneumonia, the indicated treatment is intravenous acyclovir. 105 Similarly, herpes simplex virus pneumonia is treated with intravenous acyclovir. 106 The evidence for the use of these therapies is weak and comes in the form of observational studies (Fig. 7) .",

            "text": "The identification of a viral pathogen in pneumonia should not in itself prompt a clinician to discontinue the initial empirical antibiotics because dual bacterial-viral infection is common. In fact, the recognition that dual bacterial-viral is common seems to be reflected in clinical practice. In an observational study, most patients with respiratory tract infection admitted to the hospital who turned out to have an identified viral pathogen did not have their antibiotics discontinued. 107 On the other hand, the use of a clinical pathway integrating the results of viral microbiology testing with clinical findings and procalcitonin testing could have a role in the safe discontinuation of antibiotics. It is now well established that use of procalcitonin to guide initiation and discontinuation of antibiotic in patients with acute respiratory tract infection leads to less use of antibiotics without worsening the outcomes. 108 In a randomized clinical trial of 300 hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract infection, the use of combined procalcitonin and viral polymerase chain reaction tests was compared with standard care. Both groups had similar antibiotic exposure. However, a lower proportion of patients with a positive viral polymerase chain reaction test and low procalcitonin received antibiotic on discharge as compared with standard care. 109 This study suggests that the result of a viral polymerase chain reaction test has the impact to further influence decision making even after procalcitonin and clinical evolution are factored in. It should be noted, however, that this was a feasibility study and patients with pneumonia were excluded. Additionally, viral polymerase chain reaction test result may not influence antibiotic decision in the absence of a protocol. This was shown in an observational, retrospective study in which only 10.5% of patients had antibiotic discontinued within 48 hours of a positive viral respiratory panel and a low procalcitonin result. 110 Another randomized clinical trial assessed the effect of point-of-care respiratory viral panel in patients with acute respiratory illness or fever. The study enrolled 720 patients. There was no difference in the primary endpoint, which was the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics. However, the relevance of the primary outcome was impaired because many patients received antibiotics before the results of the point-of-care test. A significantly greater proportion of patients in the point-of-care group received only a single dose of antibiotics (10% vs 3%) or antibiotics for less than 48 hours (17% vs 9%). 111 In summary, there is weak but mounting evidence that the use of nucleic acid amplification tests have the potential to aid in the decision to discontinue antibiotics in patients with respiratory infection (including pneumonia) but it is more likely to do so if integrated with clinical findings and procalcitonin. Additionally, continuing clinician education will be important to ensure implementation of strategies to minimize antibiotic exposure.",

            "text": "An exuberant inflammatory response can play a major role in the morbidity and mortality of patients with pneumonia. Corticosteroid has been used as a way of mitigating the exacerbated inflammatory response in these patients. A systematic review has synthesized the results of clinical trials assessing systemic corticosteroids. The clinical trials are mostly small with sample sizes ranging from 30 to 784 patients. Although no statistically significant improvement in mortality was observed in general, corticosteroids led to a reduction in mortality in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (risk ratio 0.39; CI 0.20-0.77). 112 Corticosteroids may be particularly beneficial in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and heightened inflammatory state, as demonstrated in a trial that enrolled patients with severe communityacquired pneumonia and a C-reactive protein greater than 150 mg/L. 113 In summary, despite the small sample size of most trials, the weight of evidence currently favors the use of systemic corticosteroids in patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to the hospital, particularly in patients with a high inflammatory state and severe pneumonia. Our approach currently is to reserve the use of corticosteroids for patients with community-acquired pneumonia with C-reactive protein greater than 150 mg/L and a lactic acid greater than 4 nmol/L or acidosis with pH <7.30. 114 The 2009 H1N1 pandemic brought to light the use of systemic corticosteroid in influenza pneumonia. Some studies revealed that 40% to 50% of patients with severe influenza pneumonia received corticosteroid during the pandemic. 115, 116 Unfortunately, although corticosteroid appears to be beneficial in patients with severe communityacquired pneumonia, the same does not hold true for patients with influenza pneumonia, a condition in which corticosteroids may actually be detrimental, as demonstrated in the systematic review. In this study, the investigators pooled 10 observational studies (total of 1497 patients) and found that corticosteroid therapy was associated with higher odds of death (OR 2.12; 95% CI 1.36-3.29). Of note, the studies included in the meta-analysis were predominantly conducted during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and in the ICU setting. 117 A clinical trial designed to evaluate the effect of systemic corticosteroid in ICU patients with the 2009 H1N1 influenza pneumonia was unable to enroll the planned number of patients, highlighting the difficulties in conducting a clinical trial during a pandemic. 116 A limitation of the observational studies assessing corticosteroid therapy in influenza pneumonia is the possibility of confounding by indication; that is, the possibility that sicker patients are more often prescribed systemic corticosteroid. This has the potential to cause the false impression that corticosteroid therapy leads to worse outcomes in influenza pneumonia. Some studies adjusted for confounding factors, but residual confounding can still occur. In the absence of randomized clinical trials, and in view of the results of observational studies, it is our opinion that currently corticosteroid therapy should not be administered in influenza pneumonia. The effect of corticosteroid in patients with noninfluenza viral pneumonia is unclear.",

However, one of the downsides of nucleic acid amplifications tests was a relatively long turnaround, limiting its clinical utility. This has been overcome by the development of \"point-of-care\" polymerase chain reaction tests that have a turnaround time of approximately 1 hour. 118 The assessment of these point-of-care tests in clinical pathways is a promising venue for clinical investigation. As these tests are being rapidly integrated into clinical practice, it is important to study their costeffectiveness and whether they influence outcomes or decision making.",

            "text": "Ongoing research on antiviral treatment is promising. Just as for bacterial infection, combination therapy has been studied in influenza infection with different goals, such as preventing pathogen resistance, 119, 120 mitigating the inflammatory response, 121 or achieving synergy. 122, 123 There has been development of new compounds for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus. These include a fusion inhibitor, which prevents the fusion of respiratory syncytial virus viral envelope with the host cell membrane, and a nucleoside analog, which prevents respiratory syncytial virus replication. 124, 125 SUMMARY Viral respiratory infection is common in pneumonia and is present in approximately 25% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. It is also common in immunosuppressed patients, but the latter are susceptible not only to the usual community-acquired respiratory viruses but also to viruses of the Herpesviridae family. Recent data show that respiratory viruses are also identified in hospital-acquired infections. The clinical diagnosis of viral infection is challenging. Clinical prediction rules have been developed for the diagnosis of influenza infection but they showed only modest accuracy. Similarly, radiological studies are nonspecific. In the end, the diagnosis of viral infection relies on the recognition that respiratory viruses are commonly present in pneumonia, and on the systematic performance of viral microbiology studies, particularly nucleic acid amplifications tests. The treatment of influenza pneumonia is currently with a neuraminidase inhibitor. The treatment options for pneumonia caused by other viruses in immunocompetent patients with pneumonia are limited, and the data are largely anecdotal. In immunosuppressed patients with infection by respiratory syncytial virus or a virus of the Herpesviridae family, there are antiviral treatments available. There is ongoing research involved with the development and testing of new treatment strategies both for influenza and noninfluenza viruses.",
