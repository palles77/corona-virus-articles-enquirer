            "text": "In the central nervous system (CNS), innate immune surveillance is mainly coordinated by microglia. These CNS resident myeloid cells are assumed to help orchestrate the immune response against infections of the brain. However, their specific role in this process and their interactions with CNS infiltrating immune cells, such as blood-borne monocytes and T cells are only incompletely understood. The recent development of PLX5622, a specific inhibitor of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor that depletes microglia, allows studying the role of microglia in conditions of brain injury such as viral encephalitis, the most common form of brain infection. Here we used this inhibitor in a model of viral infection-induced epilepsy, in which C57BL/6 mice are infected by a picornavirus (Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus) and display seizures and hippocampal damage. Our results show that microglia are required early after infection to limit virus distribution and persistence, most likely by modulating T cell activation. Microglia depletion accelerated the occurrence of seizures, exacerbated hippocampal damage, and led to neurodegeneration in the spinal cord, which is normally not observed in this mouse strain. This study enhances our understanding of the role of microglia in viral encephalitis and adds to the concept of microglia-T cell crosstalk.",

            "text": "Viral encephalitis is the most common form of brain infection and can cause severe and life-threatening consequences, including epilepsy (Vezzani et al., 2016) . Monocyte infiltration and activation of microglia, the resident macrophage population of the brain, are hallmarks of CNS inflammation, including viral infection (Prinz and Priller, 2017) . However, the role of these cells in viral clearance and immunopathology is not well defined. At least in part this is due to the problems of differentiating invading monocytes from activated microglia in the brain and the lack of selective tools to manipulate these two types of myeloid cells. In several viral brain infections, activated microglia appears to be involved in inhibition of viral replication and in neurotoxicity, indicating the dual nature of microglia: they contribute to the defense of the CNS but may also bear responsibility for CNS damage (Rock et al., 2004) . Microglia expresses various Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) to identify viral signatures called Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). Upon stimulation by PAMPs microglia respond by releasing several pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1/CCL2), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, type I interferon (IFN), IFN\u03b3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1 (O'Shea et al., 2013) .",

Disease development following TMEV infection depends on the mouse strain. The SJL/J mouse strain develops a multiple sclerosis-like progressive T cell-mediated autoimmune demyelinating disease, characterized by weakness of the hind limbs, which advances to a severe spastic paralysis, and inflammatory demyelination in the spinal cord, while the C57BL/6J (B6) mouse strain develops hippocampal damage and acute seizures, which progress to epilepsy (DePaula-Silva et al., 2017) . The striking difference between the mouse strains seems to be partially due to the strong antiviral cytotoxic CD8 + T lymphocyte response observed in B6 mice, which is suppressed by the elevated induction of regulatory CD4 + T cells (Tregs) in SJL/J mice, resulting in viral persistence and demyelination (DePaula-Silva et al., 2017) . We now report that elimination of microglia strikingly changes the disease phenotype of TMEV-infected B6 mice, indicating that microglia is much more important in this model of viral encephalitis than previously thought.",

In addition, significant invasion of CD4 + T lymphocytes (CD4 + T effector cells) was observed in the brain of both infected groups, but CD4 + cell invasion was significantly lower in the PLX5622treated group (Fig. 4A ). Significant brain invasion of CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8 + T effector cells), which are thought to play a significant role in viral clearance in the TMEV model in mice (Libbey and Fujinami, 2011; DePaula-Silva et al., 2017) , was observed both in infected controls and infected mice treated with PLX5622, without significant inter-group difference (Fig. 4B ). The brain CD4:CD8 ratio was 0.34 in infected controls, demonstrating that brain invasion of CD8 + T cells outnumbers invasion of CD4 + T cells in this model. As a result of reduced CD4 + T cell invasion in the PLX5622-treated group, the CD4:CD8 ratio was further reduced to 0.28. We also determined CD4 + and CD8 + cells in the spleen of infected mice (data not shown), resulting in a CD4:CD8 ratio of 1.3 in infected controls vs. 1.23 in PLX5622-treated animals.",

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) similar finding was obtained for the spinal cord (Fig. 4F ). Since CD8 + T cell effector function is suppressed by elevated induction of Tregs (Richards et al., 2011) , the significant increase in Tregs following CSF1R inhibition may lead to an unfavorable hippocampal and spinal cord ratio between Tregs and effector T cells, thus reducing antiviral immunity in these regions. This possibility is substantiated by the high increase in brain mRNA expression of the immunosupressive cytokine IL-10 in the brain of infected PLX5622-treated mice (see below), which is released by Tregs and suppresses the activation of cytotoxic T cells (O'Shea et al., 2013) .",

Furthermore, in this mouse strain the virus exhibits tropism to the CA1 and CA2 regions of the hippocampus following intracerebral infection (Libbey and Fujinami, 2011) . As shown in Fig. 5A , C and D, in most B6 control mice Theiler's virus was already eliminated from the hippocampus by day 6/7, except for some staining in the CA2 in a few mice. In contrast, in mice treated with PLX5622, virus antigen was present throughout the hippocampus (Fig. 5B) , resulting in significant increases in virus antigen-positive cells in the CA1/CA2 region of the hippocampus and other hippocampal regions (CA3, dentate gyrus) in which normally the virus is not present (Fig. 5C and D) . At higher magnification, localization of the virus in neuronal cell bodies was visible in the hippocampus. In addition, virus antigen was infrequently observed outside neurons, associated with cells (most likely macrophages) around small vessels in the hippocampus. Furthermore, virus antigen was detectable in cerebral cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus (Fig. 5E ), striatum and several other brain regions of PLX5622-treated mice, demonstrating that treatment with this compound increased the brain distribution of the virus. This is also illustrated by the presence of virus antigen in the spinal cord, in which the virus was not present in infected B6 vehicle controls (Fig. 5F ). In addition to TMEV protein, we also determined TMEV mRNA, substantiating the significantly reduced elimination of the virus by treatment with PLX5622 ( Fig. 5G and H) .",

For further evaluating the activation status of myeloid cells in the brain, the amount of Iba1-and Mac-3-immunolabeled cells was compared in the hippocampus.

Regarding Iba1-labeling, almost no such labeling was observed in mockinfected controls (Fig. 7A) , while the number of Iba1 + cells significantly increased in infected controls (Fig. 7B) .

Furthermore, FJC-labeled neurons were observed in the cortex. Counting of FJC-positive cells in the hippocampus substantiated the impression of visual inspections of sections in that infected mice treated with PLX5622 exhibited significantly more degenerating neurons in the hippocampus than infected controls (see Fig. 8I and J as examples; significant differences also observed in CA3a, CA3c, and dentate gyrus).",

            "text": "In contrast to SJL/J mice, B6 mice typically do not develop a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease in the spinal cord, so B6 mice are considered to be resistant to the TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (Libbey and Fujinami, 2011) . Consistent with this view, infected B6 control mice did not show any indication of cell death or inflammation in the spinal cord (Fig. 9C ) except for a moderate increase in CD3 + T lymphocytes and Mac-3 labeling ( Fig. 9K and L) . Furthermore, myelin staining did not reveal any demyelination (Fig. 9E) . In contrast, PLX5622-treated mice exhibited TMEV antigen (Fig. 9A) , necrosis of motor neurons ( Fig. 9B and G) and inflammation in the spinal cord (Fig. 9D, H-J) , thus explaining the paralysis observed in these mice (see below). Also, a significant increase in Foxp3 + regulatory T cells was only observed in PLX-treated mice (Fig. 4D) . Demyelination was not observed in PLX5622-treated mice (Fig. 9F) , which may be due to the fact that mice were killed 6-7 days after infection, because demyelination is known to develop slowly in sensitive mouse strains such as SJL/J (DePaula-Silva et al., 2017).

Animals showed severe paralysis of the hind limbs (Fig. 10B) , bent-back posture, and a strong decrease in activity and food uptake. This health impairment was also displayed by severe loss of weight (Fig. 10C) . Hence, some animals, which strongly showed these symptoms, had to be sacrificed before day seven to avoid suffering.

            "text": "Intracerebral infection of B6 mice with Theiler's virus is the first, and currently only, rodent model of viral encephalitis-induced seizures and epilepsy (Vezzani et al., 2016; DePaula-Silva et al., 2017) . This model is ideally suited to investigate the mechanisms underlying the generation of seizures and hippocampal pathology developing during and after viral encephalitis. In contrast to B6 mice, which rapidly clear the virus, the virus persists in the CNS of SJL/J mice, which do not develop seizures and hippocampal damage, but a slowly progressing inflammatory demyelination in the spinal cord, making the TMEV infection in SJL/J mice a widely used model of multiple sclerosis (Oleszak et al., 2004; Procaccini et al., 2015; DePaula-Silva et al., 2017) . While TMEV persistence in SJL/J mice is important to induce chronic demyelination, the trigger mechanism for demyelination is inflammation and the induction of autoimmunity (DePaula-Silva et al., 2017) . The persistence of TMEV in the CNS of SJL/J mice is thought to be related, at least in part, to the high induction of Tregs during the acute stage of the infection, because Tregs can secrete immunosuppressive cytokines (such as IL-10), thereby blocking activation and effector function of cytotoxic CD8 + T cells that are important for viral clearance (Richards et al., 2011) . In contrast to SJL/J mice, the lower number of Tregs induced in B6 mice after TMEV infection has been suggested to allow for rapid viral clearance by CD8 + T effector cells (Richards et al., 2011) . Fig. 7 . Neuroinflammation as indicated by Iba1 and Mac-3 labeling and double labeling. While Iba1 labels both resting and activated microglia and infiltrated monocytes in the brain, Mac-3 only labels activated microglia and infiltrated monocytes. (A) Representative photomicrographs of a mock-infected control mouse. The first graph shows labeling of cell nuclei by DAPI in blue, the second graph Iba1 labeled cells in green, the third graph Mac-3 labeled cells in red, and the fourth graph cells labeled for both Iba1 and Mac-3. Only few Iba1 and no Mac-3 labeled cells are visible, consistent with the lack of neuroinflammation in mock-infected mice. (B) Representative photomicrographs of an infected control mouse. Note the marked increase in both Iba1 and Mac-3 labeling. Both ramified and round cell types are visible. Iba1 and Mac-3 double labeled cells are indicated in yellow. (C) Representative photomicrographs of an infected mouse with PLX5622 treatment. Note the lack of ramified cells, which is due to microglia depletion. Scale bar in A, B and C = 100 \u00b5m. (D-I) Quantitative data for expression of Iba1, Iba1/Mac-3 double labeled cells, and the \"activation percentage\" indicated by Iba1/Mac-3 double labeling. Data are shown as boxplots with whiskers from minimum to maximal values; the horizontal line in the boxes represents the median value. In addition, individual data are shown. Sample size: 4 mock-infected controls; 4-5 mock-infected mice with PLX5622; 7-8 infected controls; 6-8 infected mice with PLX5622. Significant differences to mock-infected mice are indicated by asterisks ( * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01) while significant differences between infected mice treated with PLX5622 and infected controls are indicated by the hash sign ( # P < 0.05; I. Waltl et al. Brain, Behavior, and Immunity 74 (2018) 186-204 Indeed, Tregs, characterized by expression of the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), are known to modulate the immune response to viral infection, and numerous infection models have demonstrated that Treg depletion increases viral clearance and IFN\u03b3 production by CD8 + T cells (Groux et al., 1997; Dittmer et al., 2004; He et al., 2004; Eggena et al., 2005) . However, in TMEV-infected B6 mice, ablation of Foxp3 + Tregs during the acute disease phase of TMEV infection did not accelerate virus clearance (Prajeeth et al., 2014) . In contrast, ablation of cytotoxic CD8 + T cells rendered B6 mice susceptible to develop chronic demyelinating neuroinfection comparable to the encephalomyelitis observed in SJL/J mice, which might partly be mediated by boosting the suppressive capacity of Tregs on viral elimination (Ciurkiewicz et al., 2017) .",

Previously, understanding the roles that microglia play in a neurotropic viral infection and how these roles affect the immune response to viruses has been complicated by differentiating microglia from extensively infiltrating monocytes with potentially overlapping functions during neuroinflammation (Terry et al., 2012; Prinz and Priller, 2014; . Furthermore, while microglia, the resident macrophages of the CNS, are often touted as the first responders to a CNS viral infection and are known to respond rapidly to injury (Rock et al., 2004; Carrithers, 2014) , there is little direct evidence to show that microglia are needed for an optimal host response to pathogens. Selective and complete depletion of microglia by chronic treatment with the CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622 is an ideal means to study the functions that microglia use in responding to viruses. PLX5622 is a potent inhibitor of CSF1R tyrosine kinase activity (Ki = 5.9 nM) with at least 50-fold selectivity over 4 related kinases, and over 100-fold selectivity against a panel of 230 kinases (Dagher et al., 2015) . As shown here, by the PLX5622 treatment protocol used, CSF1R mRNA expression in the CNS was almost completely lost, which is a consequence of the depletion of microglia that express this mRNA.",

Indeed, suppression of monocyte infiltration by deleting the chemokine receptor CCR2 prevented hippocampal damage following TMEV infection, but did not prevent encephalitis-associated seizures , thus challenging previous assumptions with less selective approaches (Cusick et al., 2013) . The present study shows that depletion of microglia by PLX5622 exacerbates hippocampal damage and increases progression of seizures following viral encephalitis, indicating that microglia may exhibit a protective role in this model, at least in the early phase following infection. Furthermore, neuronal damage, associated with severe motor impairment, occurred in the spinal cord, which is typically not affected in B6 mice. The severe clinical impairment and enhanced mortality in infected mice treated with PLX5622 did not allow evaluating whether spinal cord demyelination occurs at later stages of the infection as observed in TMEV-infected SJL/J mice.",

            "text": "The first study that reported the effect of microglia depletion in B6 mice on viral encephalitis used intracranial infection with a neuroattenuated variant of the JHMV strain of MHV (Wheeler et al., 2018) , which induces mild acute encephalitis and acute and chronic demyelinating disease (Bergmann et al., 2006) . Treatment with PLX5622 increased CNS replication of MHV and subsequent mortality in B6 mice, which was explained by ineffective innate and virus-specific T cell responses resulting from microglia depletion (Wheeler et al., 2018) . Indeed, microglia depletion led to a markedly reduced brain infiltration of CD4 + T cells and Foxp3 + Tregs as well as IFN\u03b3 expression at 7 days after infection (Wheeler et al., 2018) . The present data show that these consequences of microglia depletion are virus specific, because we did not observe a decrease but a significant increase in infiltration of Foxp3 + Tregs in hippocampus and spinal cord and only a relatively small reduction in brain invasion of CD4 + T cells in TMEV-infected, PLX5622-treated mice compared to infected controls, although the invasion of CD4 + CD44 + T cells was markedly reduced by microglia depletion. Furthermore, in apparent contrast to the study of Wheeler et al. (2018) , IFN\u03b3 expression was significantly increased in brain and spinal cord of PLX5622-treated mice in response to TMEV infection.",

As a consequence, we observed a significant decrease in circulating CSF1R + monocytes in the blood of mock infected mice after treatment with PLX5622. After infection, blood CSF1R + monocytes increased in both controls and PLX5622-treated groups, although to a slightly lower degree in the PLX5622-treated mice. This was not associated with any obvious reduction in brain infiltration of blood-derived monocytes as both demonstrated by flow cytometry and immunolabeling by Mac-3 and Iba1. Instead, both Mac-3 and Iba1 indicated an increase of myeloid cells in the hippocampus and spinal cord of infected mice after depletion of microglia, indicating that infiltrating hematopoietic monocytes/macrophages try to compensate for the lack of microglia.

Many viral infections, including TMEV, result in the vigorous production of IL-6 (Kothur et al., 2016; DePaula-Silva et al., 2017) . B6 mice carrying an IL-6 transgene, resulting in the production of excessive IL-6, develop a TMEV-induced demyelinating disease accompanied by an increase in viral persistence and an elevated Th17 cell response in the CNS (Hou et al., 2014) . IL-17 producing Th17 cells have been shown to promote Fig. 11 . Insult-associated seizures monitored in the first week after infection. Experiments were performed several times (see Fig. 1 ) and data summarized; sample size: 19 mock-infected controls; 20 mock-infected mice with PLX5622; 28 infected controls; 27 infected mice with PLX5622. (A) Occurrence of acute (early) seizures in the 6-7 days after infection. Data are shown as percent of mice with seizures per mice infected with Theiler's DA virus for each experimental day. Significant intergroup differences are indicated by the hash sign ( # P < 0.05; ## P < 0.01). (B) illustrates the incidence of seizures in the four groups, showing that none of the noninfected controls exhibited seizures whereas 10/15 infected controls and 11/14 infected PLX-treated mice exhibited seizures, which both was significantly different from noninfected controls (indicated by asterisks; * P < 0.0001). (C) Frequency of seizures recorded in infected mice. Data are shown as boxplots with whiskers from minimum to maximal values; the horizontal line in the boxes represents the median value; in addition, individual data are shown. No intergroup difference was found. (D) Seizure severity as indicated by the maximum seizure score for each mouse with seizures. Data are shown as boxplots with whiskers from minimum to maximal values; the horizontal line in the boxes represents the median value; in addition, individual data are shown. Significant differences to noninfected controls are indicated by asterisks ( * P < 0.001). No intergroup difference was found in the experiment illustrated in D. persistent viral infection by inhibiting cytotoxic T cell function and apoptotic cell death (Hou et al., 2009) . As shown by Hou et al. (2014) , excessive IL-6 promotes the generation of Th17 cells, and the resulting IL-6 and IL-17 synergistically promote viral persistence by protecting virus-infected cells from apoptosis and CD8 + T cell-mediated target destruction. These data suggest that the 20-fold increase in IL-6 following microglia depletion by PLX5622 may be involved in the altered responses to TMEV infection observed in the present experiments. However, we did not observe an increase in IL-17 in microglia-depleted mice following TMEV infection, demonstrating low numbers of Th17 cells in this early phase of the disease (6-7 days p.i.).",

Among other cell types, IL-10 is secreted by Tregs, which were significantly increased in the brain of infected PLX5622-treated mice. Thus, similar to TMEV infection in SJL/J mice, microglia depletion in B6 mice seems to lead to an unfavorable ratio between Tregs and T effector cells, resulting in suppression of T cell activation and effector function. This interpretation of the data was substantiated when calculating the ratio between IFN\u03b3 and IL-10 in the brain of infected controls vs. infected mice treated with PLX5622, demonstrating a reversal in this ratio from 5.57 to 0.84. This indicates that IL-10 suppressed functionality of IFN\u03b3-releasing T effector cells following microglia depletion.",

In neuroinflammatory CNS disorders, IFN\u03b3 is elevated mainly in viral encephalitis, suggesting activation of lymphocytes in the CNS which participate in viral clearance (Kothur et al., 2016) . IFN\u03b3, which is produced by activated natural killer (NK) and T cells, is important for virus clearance and induces many immunomodulatory effects, including activation of macrophages, promotion of leukocyte adhesion to allow trafficking of cells to the CNS, direct antiviral and antiproliferative effects, and induction of the release of other cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 (Bowen and Olson, 2013) . IFN\u03b3 has been implicated in the clearance of virus from CNS following infection with a wide variety of viruses, including TMEV (Rodriguez et al., 2003) . However, at high concentrations as observed following microglia depletion here, IFN\u03b3 is neurotoxic through a neuron specific, calciumpermeable complex of IFN\u03b3-receptor and the AMPA subtype of glutamate receptors (Mizuno et al., 2008) . Thus, IFN\u03b3 in concert with other cytokines such as IL-6\u03b2 may contribute to the increased degeneration of hippocampal and spinal cord motor neurons and clinical signs observed after microglia depletion in TMEV-infected mice.",

By debris clearance and continuously contacting dendritic spines to regulate structural synaptic changes, microglia plays a fundamental role in facilitating the reorganization of neuronal circuits and triggering repair in CNS injury (Neumann et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2013) . Proper synaptic pruning (or engulfment) by microglia has been shown to modulate seizure threshold (Kim et al., 2013) , which could explain the facilitated seizure induction observed after microglia depletion in Theiler's virus-infected mice.",

            "text": "Overall, based on the present data, the following scenario can be postulated. Depletion of microglia reduces the local immune response to infection, resulting in increased virus proliferation. Enhanced induction of Tregs in hippocampus and spinal cord and resulting IL-10 release seem to add to the reduced immune response to viral infection observed after microglia depletion. On the other hand, markedly Fig. 12 . TNF\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN\u03b3 mRNA expression in brain and spinal cord of infected mice. Data are shown as boxplots with whiskers from minimum to maximal values; the horizontal line in the boxes represents the median value. Note that y-axis has a logarithmic scale. In addition, individual data are shown. Sample size is 5 for noninfected mice and 6 for infected mice. Significant differences to mock-infected mice are indicated by asterisks ( * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01) while significant differences between infected mice treated with PLX5622 and infected controls are indicated by the hash sign ( # P < 0.05; ## P < 0.01). increased IL-6, and, in the spinal cord, IFN\u03b3 levels contribute to neurodegeneration and elevated seizure susceptibility. Also, the increased astrogliosis observed in infected, microglia-depleted mice may contribute to neuroinflammation and related processes, although a neurotoxic subtype (A1) of astrocytes, which is induced by neuroinflammatory microglia (Liddelow et al., 2017) , should be reduced or absent in microglia-depleted mice. Our results demonstrate a critical role for microglia in the context of viral encephalitis, affecting virus replication and innate and adaptive immune responses as well as disease progression and severity. However, as indicated by the significant differences in response to microglia depletion between the study of Wheeler et al. (2018) with a coronavirus (MHV) and the present study with a picornavirus (TMEV), both performed in B6 mice, the role of microglia in viral encephalitis markedly depends on the specific virus inducing the disease. Furthermore, the severity of viral encephalitis certainly has an impact on specific microglia response. The present findings enhance our understanding of microglia-T cell crosstalk that seems to play a vital role in neuroinflammation, whether through soluble mediators or via contact-dependent interactions (Schetters et al., 2017) .",
