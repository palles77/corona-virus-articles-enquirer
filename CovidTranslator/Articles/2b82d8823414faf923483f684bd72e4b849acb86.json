This second part of the article will use the conceptual, moral, and legal framework of Part I to address privacy and confidentiality issues commonly encountered in the emergency department (ED). Following the convention adopted in Part I of the article, this part of the article will use the term ''privacy'' to refer to protection from the physical presence of or exposure of one's body to unauthorized persons and ''confidentiality'' to refer to protection of patient information from disclosure to unauthorized persons. The article will begin by examining privacy issues and then consider confidentiality issues in the ED.",

In one study, investigators reported frequent breaches of privacy and confidentiality in a university hospital ED. 1 ED patients in another university hospital reported that they were more likely to be seen and overheard by unauthorized persons in curtained treatment areas than in rooms with solid walls. 2 Although 92.6% of the 104 patients in the latter study reported that their expectations for privacy in the ED were met, 4 patients (all in curtained treatment areas) reported withholding part of their medical history, refusing part of their examination, or both because of privacy concerns. These limited studies, and the authors' personal experience, suggest that patient privacy in the ED is routinely compromised by physical ED design, crowding, or lack of caregiver vigilance.",

In response to these difficult conditions, however, emergency physicians can take important steps to protect their patients from unnecessary and undesired physical exposure. Emergency physicians should strive to minimize patient waiting time in ED treatment areas, thereby reducing overall patient volume. Emergency physicians should also use all available treatment areas and partitions to separate patients from one another as effectively as possible. They should insist on the use of movable privacy screens when procedures and tests (such as ECGs) must be performed on patients in open areas. When the opportunity arises, emergency physicians should advise designers of new and renovated EDs about ways to make patient privacy and confidentiality a high priority in a patient-centered ED environment.",

Similarly, when staffing levels are limited, it may be necessary to place severely ill or injured patients in an area where a single nurse can continuously monitor several patients simultaneously. Patients who exhibit or seriously threaten violence against ED staff or others in the ED may need to be interviewed, observed, and treated in secure areas and in the presence of hospital security personnel or law enforcement officers to protect staff or others at risk.",

Some maintain that patients may not refuse the presence of students in a teaching institution, whereas others believe that consent to the presence of students may be presumed if the patient does not actively object, and still others maintain that explicit consent should be obtained from patients for the presence of students. 5 Most patients accept the participation of students in their own medical care despite its circumscription of their privacy. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Patients should be informed of the identity and role of all of their caregivers, including students. Careful consideration should be given to patient requests that students not participate in their care. Honoring such requests may depend on the reasons for the request. For example, if a request is based on the student's race, it should not be honored. If, in contrast, a request is made because of a personal relationship between the patient and the student, it should be honored.",

Under this approach, by the time permission to air a film is requested, the patient's physical privacy has already been violated by the very presence of a film crew within an area where the patient has a ''reasonable expectation of privacy,'' the standard that must be satisfied both legally and ethically. If filmmakers do seek consent from patients before filming, another problem confronts them. To capture the sense of drama and life-threatening danger to which these shows aspire, patients who are approached for consent are often vulnerable and in a state of compromised decisionmaking capacity. Included in this category are patients with acute medical conditions (eg, myocardial infarction), chronic medical conditions (eg, stroke), psychiatric disturbances, mental retardation, limited education, language barriers, or incarceration. Such patients often cannot give valid consent to be filmed. ED staff or students are also vulnerable to coercion and may feel obliged to consent to being filmed. 25, 26 Because they are dependent on their supervisors or instructors for their continuing employment or advancement, staff and students, like many patients, may believe that they will not be treated as well if they do not accede to requests to be filmed.",

An American Medical Association Code of Ethics opinion issued in 2001 also requires previous consent of the patient for filming, except when the patient is ''permanently or indefinitely incompetent.'' 28 An American College of Emergency Physicians policy adopted in 2002 ''discourages the filming of television programs in emergency departments except when patients and staff members can give fully informed consent prior to their participation.'' 29 One final policy, adopted by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine in 2001, rejects all commercial filming of patients in the following words: ''Image recording by commercial entities does not provide benefit to the patient and should not occur in either the out-of-hospital or emergency department setting.'' 30 Physicians and administrators should also be aware that civil lawsuits for the tort of invasion of privacy have recently been filed against some hospitals and producers involved with these activities, and some hospitals have already entered into out-of-court settlements.",

Standard measures for protecting medical records include establishing a secure location for records, returning records to that location after use rather than leaving them on a counter or table, and removing or covering information on the front of the patient's chart. 31, 32 Many EDs are now using computer applications for patient tracking, physician order entry, prescription and aftercare instructions, and keeping the medical record. In such cases, lists of patients along with their chief complaints are typically displayed on status boards that can be accessed by various computers around the department (similar to the white grease boards that used to be a staple in many EDs). In such cases, computers must be situated so that the public cannot view them, and privacy screens may be required in certain locations. All such computers should require password access, and access should be granted only to those with a legitimate need for it. These computers must also be set to automatically ''time out'' (revert to the screen saver) within a short period when not in use, if they are not closed by the user. Computer systems that are used to view imaging studies should have similar safeguards.",

Because emergency physicians typically lack an ongoing or long-term relationship with their patients, they will often be unable to assess the degree or seriousness of the risk a psychiatric or substance-abusing patient may pose to third parties. Even if they do diagnose a severe and highly contagious disease, emergency physicians will usually require the cooperation of the patient to identify third parties who may be at risk.

Other overriding concerns may occasionally justify the limited release of information over the telephone.

If it is not possible to obtain consent from the patient before filming, then consent must be obtained before the film is used for educational purposes.'' 52 This policy allows surrogate consent for the use of a film only in the case of minor children or permanently incompetent adults. In a similar statement, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors asserts that ''identifying information should not be published in written descriptions, photographs, or pedigrees unless the information is essential for scientific purposes and the patient (or parent or guardian) gives written informed consent for publication.'' 53 If explicit informed consent is required for use of images in professional education, it should follow that it is also required for use of images in research, public education, and entertainment, where the potential scope of dissemination of the images is much greater.

[55] [56] [57] The benefits of electronic storage, retrieval, and transmittal are numerous; they include the timely availability of information to clinicians such as medical history, medications, and previous ECGs. These benefits may be especially important in the ED because patients often arrive without documentation of their condition or of treatment provided at other institutions. A disadvantage, however, is that widespread availability of electronic records and the use of electronic data transmission opens the door to unauthorized access, a clear violation of confidentiality. Stories abound of ''hackers'' who have found access to supposedly ''secure'' information, such as financial and even national security information. The HIPAA privacy rule requires that access to electronic records be given only to authorized individuals. 42 A HIPAA-authorized security rule, to take effect in April 2005, will require that electronically transmitted health information be encrypted according to strict standards. 58 Medical records are also sometimes transmitted by fax. In such cases, safeguards must be in place, including ensuring that the receiving fax number is correct and that machines that receive faxes are in secure locations accessible only to authorized personnel. When ED reports are automatically transmitted to primary care providers after an ED visit, it is important that the database of fax numbers be updated periodically. (Similarly, the database of e-mail addresses must also be periodically updated if reports are automatically transmitted by e-mail.) It is also good practice for the fax cover sheet to indicate the confidential nature of the items being faxed. When documents that are received either electronically or by fax will not be made part of the permanent medical record, care must be taken to dispose of them confidentially. Shredders or dedicated locked trash bins are often used for this purpose.",

Numerous factors must be considered when a minor patient requests confidential health care, including the best interest of the patient, future patient attitudes toward health care, concerns of the parents, federal and state laws, and public health issues. [59] [60] [61] Physician attitudes about issues of adolescent confidentiality show considerable variation in different health care settings. 62, 63 For minors who do not meet criteria for emancipation or ''mature minor'' status and whose conditions do not receive statutory confidentiality protection, issues of confidentiality can be difficult. For example, parents may request health information about their child, but the minor patient may, for a variety of reasons, request that the information not be disclosed to them. Ideally, education of minor patients about the importance of parental involvement in their health care may bridge the gap between the parties. In most such cases, minor patients should be encouraged to be open about health care decisions with their parents. If consent cannot be obtained from the minor patient, the issue of disclosure to parents becomes more controversial. Some argue that parents have a right to receive health information about their dependent children. Others believe that minor patients have the same rights of privacy and confidentiality about health care as adults, particularly because adolescent minors are more likely to seek health care when confidentiality is ensured. 64, 65 In general, decisions about disclosure without consent of a minor patient should be made in the best interests of the patient and his or her parents, with careful consideration of state and federal law.",

The Figure offers a summary listing of practical ways to protect privacy and confidentiality in the ED.",

Because legal mandates are neither necessary nor sufficient to satisfy the moral obligations of physicians, it is essential that physicians understand and accept their responsibility to protect privacy and confidentiality on moral and legal grounds.",
