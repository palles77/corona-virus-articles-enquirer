The number of individuals coming from Asian countries was significantly smaller and the overall prevalence in these countries was 2.9% (95%CI -0.3; -6.2). There was only one case (1/14 (7.14%) from an individual from East European countries. The seroprevalence in units attending potentially immunosuppressed patients was significantly lower (5.64%) compared with the seroprevalence in other units of the hospital (10.20%) or Tropical diseases units (13.33%) (p<0.001). Conclusions: We report a hospital-based systematic screening of strongyloidiasis with a seroprevalence of almost 10% in a mobile population coming from endemic areas suggesting the need of implementing strongyloidiasis screening in hospitalized patients coming from endemic areas, particularly if they are at risk of immunosuppression.",

In addition, the prevalence in patients with an impaired immune system (immunosuppression) was lower compared with people non suffering immunosuppression. These results suggest that the prevalence of strongyloidiasis is quite high among migrants living in Spain and that a screening programme should be designed, particularly in immunosuppressed patients that are at more risk of suffering severe complications of the infection. public health impact in non-endemic countries that are hosting these populations [1, 2] . The infection is ubiquitous in tropical and subtropical areas although it may also occur in temperate countries with the appropriate conditions such as certain areas of Spain or Italy [3] [4] [5] . Worldwide estimates based on standard faecal techniques have suggested that between 30 and 100 million people worldwide are infected. These figures may be underestimated due to the low sensitivity of the traditional diagnostic methods [1, 6] .",

In the first place, the infection can persist the whole lifetime due to its ability to replicate in the human host [8] . Therefore, people coming from endemic areas may be at risk their whole life irrespective of the moment they arrive to a nonendemic area as long as they are not treated. Second, Strongyloides stercoralis infection is generally asymptomatic or causes unspecific symptoms, being unnoticed for health professionals not looking for it [9] . Third, although the infection is rarely transmitted through person to person, [10] it can be transmitted through organ transplantation, and autochthonous cases have been reported in nonendemic areas [11] . Thus, screening should be considered in potential donors at risk of the infection [12] [13] [14] . Finally, in case of immunosuppression, particularly described with the concomitant use of steroids, transplant recipients or patients with malignancies and Human T-Cell Lymphotropic virus-1 co-infections, the parasite may enter into a high replicating cycle (called hyperinfection) or disseminate to vital organs (disseminated strongyloidiasis), causing a severe disease with high mortality [15] . In this regard, immunosuppression permit larval proliferation (hyperinfection disease) and also dissemination to other organs (disseminated Strongyloides) [15] .

Generalizing our prevalence results to the general (or wider) population should be done with caution since the positive selection bias should be taken into account. In addition, another limitation is the difference of the prevalence between the hospitals participating in this study that could be partially explained by differences in the migrant profile.

Thus, 1,948 individuals were finally included. Basic demographic data are summarized in table 1. The median age was 38 years (Interquartile range 31-47) and 57.96% were male; 804 (41.27%) were screened at Infectious diseases or Tropical diseases units, 709 (36.40%) in HIV-units, 150 (7.70%) in transplant units, 101 (5.18%) in Oncology or Haematology units, and 86 (4.41%) in Rheumatology or Autoimmune diseases departments or other units addressing specifically immunosuppressed patients. Finally, 77 (3.95%) and 21 (1.08%) were recruited in general services of the hospital (e.g. Emergency, Internal Medicine) and in 21(1.08%), the origin-department was unknown.Of the total screened population, 58.96% (1106/1,876) had a Latin-American origin, 31.98% (600/1,876) were from Africa, 5.49 (103) from Asia and 3.57% (67) from Europe. There were differences across the centres concerning the country of origin of individuals screened. This could be explained by the demographics of the migration flows in Spain: In the hospital located in Almeria, which is very close to the African border, 94.39% had an African origin whereas for the rest of hospitals, more than half of individuals have a Latin-American origin (",

In addition, it is still not clear if the serology should not be recommended in such cases or if the screening should be performed adding other direct parasitological techniques [16]. Unfortunately, and due to the study design, we could not have the information about the level of immunosuppression that patients had at the time the screening test was performed. Therefore, we cannot estimate to what extent the lower-sensitivity of the screening test is causing this difference. Further prospective studies should better evaluate the accuracy of the serological test in immunosuppressed patients including the assessment of the accuracy with different levels or categories of immunosuppression. It must be added that the prevalence of Latin-American migrants screened in these units (HIV and transplant) was particularly lower compared with the rest of units of screening.
