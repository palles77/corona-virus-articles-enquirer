Less commonly, sudden death, ulcerative dermatitis, limping, abortion, jaundice and severe pneumonia can occur (Greene, 2006) . FCV has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of the feline chronic gingivo-stomatitis complex (FCGS), but its role remains uncertain (Knowles et al., 1991) .",

Outbreaks have been associated with a high mortality rate (up to 50%); besides upper respiratory tract disease, affected cats showed a range of clinical signs of variable severity, including fever, cutaneous oedema, ulcerative dermatitis, anorexia and jaundice. VSD, initially termed haemorrhagic-like fever, shares some features with rabbit haemorrhagic disease caused by another calicivirus, the Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV). FCV-VSD strains are described as highly contagious, with marked tropism for endothelial and epithelial cells of the skin and parenchymal organs which explains the clinical manifestation of the disease. Adult cats are often more severely affected than kittens, and vaccination does not prevent VSD.",

A similarly high degree of nucleotide sequence identity (99.3-99.6%) was observed between FCV isolates from the asymptomatic cats (cat #3, #6, and #7) (Table 2) . However, lower sequence similarity was observed when the isolates from the asymptomatic cats were compared to the isolates from the oropharyngeal swab (82.2-82.9%) and tissues (63.8-64.9%) of ''Oscar'' (Table 2) . A comparison with the sequences of VS-FCV reference strains (GenBank DQ910792 and AY560117) showed nucleotide sequence similarities between 60.7-62.8% in the tissue isolates and 77.7-82.6% in the isolate from the oropharyngeal swab of Oscar. The amino acid identity between the FCV isolates in this study (isolates from oropharyngeal swabs of cat #3, #6, and #7 and from oropharyngeal swab and tissues of ''Oscar'') ranged from 62.5% to 98.9% (Table 2) .",

The severe clinical course is typical and the pathological findings are within the reported scope.

Calicivirus infection was definitively confirmed by virus isolation and real-time PCR not only in the diseased cat ''Oscar'', but also in asymptomatic cats that lived in direct contact with him, confirming the presence of FCV in the shelter and its maintenance in the environment by carriers cats (Wardley, 1976) .",

            "text": "It is generally speculated that genetic differences between FCV strains of low and high virulence account for the presence of local mild FCV infection or systemic infection in affected cats. Mutations within the viral genome may be responsible for the highly virulent phenotype. Since the FCV strains isolated in each outbreak of VSD were genetically distinct from each other, if viral mutations are required to cause the hyper-virulent phenotype, they must evolve independently in each outbreak. To our knowledge, no specific genetic markers for an increase in virulence have been identified, although previous reports showed that sequence differences in HVR_E lead to the acquisition of an additional glycosylation site in some VSD isolates (Foley et al., 2006; Abd-Eldaim et al., 2005) . Changes in the glycosylation pattern of viral proteins could affect the host-virus interactions and represent a mechanism for immune evasion, as reported for other viruses, such as influenza virus (Vigerust and Sheperd, 2007) . In the present study, we could identify only one additional glycosylation site in the 5 0 HVR_E sequences, in the Asn-459 residue, in all FCV isolates, but observed a high diversity in the 5 0 HVR_E region, which allowed the distinction between FCV isolated from the cat with VSD and asymptomatic cats in the present study. Although these mutations do not affect the viral glycosylation pattern, they might modify the antigenic profile of the HVR_E. The capsid protein of FCV is an important target for the immune response and molecular studies have mapped antigenic epitopes located in the HVR_E (Radford et al., 1999; Geissler et al., 2002) . Since these amino acid differences occurred in a putatively neutralising region of HVR_E, the underlying mutations might represent a mechanism for FCV immune evasion and possibly also differences in viral pathogenicity (Henzel et al., 2012) . The results of our phylogenetic analyses showed that clustering of reference viruses occurs independent of clinical signs; in particular VS-FCV associated with haemorrhagic disease are spread over different lineages of the phylogenetic tree. This result support the hypothesis of Hurley et al. (2004) who suggested that VSD can be associated with a range of FCV genotypes.",

The results of our study also confirm that each VS-FCV outbreak could be caused by a distinct, individual FCV strain (Radford et al., 2007) .",

The risk of infections is increased in multi-cat households, catteries and shelters, due to the generally close contact between animals; furthermore, immunodepression, i.e. due to chronic FIV infection, may support the generation and selection of virulent mutants and impair the host's ability to combat the mutant viruses. A similar mechanism was observed in FIV-infected cats, since they developed FIP more frequently upon experimental infection with Feline Coronavirus (FCoV; Poland et al., 1996) . In the case described here, the cat was also FIV infected and therefore immunosuppressed to some degree. This might have supported the development of the disease by allowing newly formed virulent FCV to replicate and spread systemically.",
