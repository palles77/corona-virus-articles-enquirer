It therefore seems to play a major role in the pathogenicity of the virus and influences its replication in tissue cultures and its ability to invade various organs in the animal (Daziel et al., 1986; Wege et al., 1988) . The role of S glycoprotein in determining MHV3 virulence has been studied superficially, although the nucleotide fingerprints of hepatotropic MHV3 and neurotropic MHVA59 were very similar CLai et al., 1981) .",

All fifteen of them recoL, ni7ed the S protein in its precursor form (120 kDa), its glycosylated uncleaved form (180 kDa) and its cleaved mature form (90 kDa). Among these antibodies, 12 were also able to inhibit cell fusion, if they were added 2 h after viral infection. The 15 above mentioned mAb were used to select escape mutants. In each, 1.5 x 105 infectious particles were incubated with an individual mAb at a 1/100 dil~tion. The numher of mutants isolated varied for each mAb. The mutation frequency was about 10 -4 to 10 -5. Initially, 283 escape mutants were isolated and, after recloning in presence of the specific mAb, 100 PFU of each were injected by the intraperitoileal route into five 8-to 12-week-old sensitive BALB/c mice (IFFA Credo, L'Arbresle, France) free of coronavirus antibodies. With MHV3 wt, the mice died 3 to 4 days after infection. The infection of mice with MHV3 51.6 and MI-IV3 C112 obtained with two different mAb (A51 and A37, respectively) identified by agar gel diffusion as being an IgG1 and an IgA isotype, provoked a delay in mortality ( fig. 1A ). The MHV3 51.6 was of medium virulence, with mice dying 5 to 9 days Submitted February 7, 1994, accepted April 25, 1994. (*) Corresponding author. The titre of neutralization and inhibition of cell fusion was the highest dilution able to halve the number of plaques. Protection in vivo was tested by injection of 0.2 ml of an ascites fluid into mice 1 day before the injection of 100 PFU of MHV3 wt. after infection; MHV3 Cl12 was less virulent, with mice dying 8 to 10 days post-infection.",

The predominant cells in the liver are hepatocytes (Hc), which numerically represent about 60 % of the total liver cell population. Hc were isolated according to Berry and Friend (1969) and Seglen (1976) , partially modified by Braunwald et al. (1991) . The Kupffer cells (Kc), liver endothelial cells (Ec) and Ito cells (Ic) make up the sinusoidal wall. The Kc, which are macrophages in the liver and have immunological functions, are found inside the lumen of the hepatic sinusoid at strategic positions; the Ec form a barrier which separates the perisinusoidal space from the sinusoid and possesses characteristic fenestrae which act. as filtration barriers and also provide a means of communication between the sinusoid and the space of Disse; the Ic, for fat figure 2 . In all cell cultures, MHV3 wt, the most virulent, was capable of replicating faster than the other isolates, consistently reaching higher titres. MHV3 51.6, of medium virulence, replicated in the cultures, except in Ec where basal titres were found throughout the experiment. The less virulent MHV3 Cl12 was capable of replicating, reach-ing low titres only in Ic and showing basal titres in the other cells throughout the experiment. experiments, in Ec infected with MHV3 51.6 and in Kc, Ec and Hc infected with MHV3 C112, indicate that, although these cells are permissive for the virus, its replication is very limited, though sufficient to maintain virus titre for a long period of time.",

Our results are consistent with the notion that our MV3 escape mutants display at least one single mutation in a determinant of the S glycoprotein.
