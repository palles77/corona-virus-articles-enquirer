The roles of emergency nurses are evolving and triggered by three major historical milestones. The three milestones consist of: (1) Transition of nursing education from hospital training to nursing degree program at universities in 1990; (2) The re-evolution after the establishment of Hospital Authority in 1993; (3) Hong Kong's return to China in 1997. These milestones have contributed immensely to the development of quality nursing education, nursing professionalism with emphasis on specialty knowledge and skill training in Accident and Emergency departments (AED) in Hong Kong. Since 1991, the emergency nursing role has been expanded and extended. Wound management remains one of the major extending roles for emergency nurses, who confine themselves to manage simple wounds. Nurse initiated tetanus immunization, intravenous access; investigations such as electrocardiogram, blood glucose, and urinalysis are well implemented in all AEDs under the governance of guidelines and protocols. Initial triage analgesic for the minor musculoskeletal injury and fever are also part of the triage care in some AEDs in Hong Kong now. To meet the demand and challenge, innovative role development such as lecturer practitioners and emergency nurse practitioners have been piloted and implemented recently.",

The training of nurses in Hong Kong first started in 1904 as the training of midwives. The first formal Nursing School, the School of General Nursing in Queen Mary Hospital was instituted in 1937. Since then it has undergone continuous reform in order to meet the demands arising from rapid societal changes. The format of nurses' training and its registration examination was modeled from the British system. The nursing students received 3 years of hospital-based training and were required to pass a Nursing Board Registration Examination after the completion of their training (Hong Kong Society of Nursing Education, 2002) . After the Second World War, the population of Hong Kong grew very quickly due to the influx of returning residents and refugees from China. The main thrust triggered the government to build more hospitals and was instrumental in starting the emergency services known as ''Casualty'' (Hong Kong Academy of Medicine, 2006) . With the increasing demand of nursing services, nursing education development in Hong Kong has undergone great changes especially in the late 1980s. These key changes can be seen as milestones in the history of Hong Kong nursing and are discussed below.",

The transition of basic nursing education from the 3-year hospital-based apprenticeship training to the 4-year degree program at three local universities (The University of Hong Kong, The Chinese University of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Polytechnic University) represented a big revolution and evolution in nursing education. In 1990, Hong Kong Polytechnic University started the first intake of 40 first year nursing students and traditional hospital based nursing schools started to decrease uptake of students and gradually they have faded out. A nursing graduate from a local university is usually granted both a bachelor degree qualification from the relevant university as well as a practicing qualification as a registered nurse from Nursing Council of Hong Kong (authorized nursing organization for the nursing license in Hong Kong). Now the intake of first year nursing students of each university is approaching 200 each year. The 4-year bachelor degree program in nursing aims to equip students not only with general nursing knowledge and skill, but also develop a deep awareness of holistic care in response to the increasing demand for holistic nursing care in terms of disease prevention, health promotion and research. The university nursing departments also prepare the nurses to take up extended and expanded roles in the delivery of primary, secondary and tertiary care.",

            "text": "Milestone 2: The re-evolution after the establishment of Hospital Authority From the early 1990s, various changes have taken place in Hong Kong that have triggered much advancement in nursing. The Hospital Authority (HA) was established to take over all the public hospitals. Casualty was renamed as the ''Accident and Emergency Department'' (AED). From 1993 to 1998, 5 more hospitals with AEDs were established to make up a total of 15 hospitals serving an overall population of nearly 6 million (Hong Kong Academy of Medicine, 2006) . The new HA not only brought in new hardware such as hospitals, new management structure and advanced technology in health care, but it also brought in a new system for work culture, training and promotion. In the context of AED, a management nursing team now consists of a chief of service, a departmental operating manager (DOM), a ward manager, a nurse specialist, nursing officers and nurses. Greater emphasis has been placed on outcome indicators and quality assurance. The AED needed to be open to the community and also transparent to the media. A lot of collaboration has been required among different disciplines such as the Hong Kong Police Force and Fire Services, in order to stringently maintain the security of the community. In line with HA policies, the DOM, ward manager and nurse specialist together with the departmental Chief of Service (AED) have looked into areas such as training, staffing, quality assurance, disaster planning, and the development of clinical guidelines. In addition, the introduction and extensive use of Hospital Information Systems such as the Clinical Management System and the Accident and Emergency Information System provide great support for daily nursing work in terms of management, clinical care and discharge planning for the clients. Nowadays, all AED clinical notes, laboratory results and even X-ray films are now scanned and stored in the AED data base for easy retrieval and storage (Hong Kong Academy of Medicne, 2006) .",

In addition, an AED nurse with 2-years AED working experience normally gets through the training of Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) and Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) as well as other related courses. Besides this, more comprehensive certificates and diploma courses have been introduced such as the Emergency Nursing Course or Post Graduate Diploma in Critical Care -these courses are aimed at developing AED nurses' knowledge and clinical competencies.",

More communication such as visits and conferences are now held to enhance better communication and collaboration.

This model of care is task focused; tasks are divided with each nurse assuming the responsibilities for specific tasks. For example, one nurse is assigned to perform wound care, whereas another nurse may assume responsibility for medication administration or triage care. The nurses become highly competent with the tasks although the drawback of this model is problems with continuity of care (Potter and Perry, 2005 ). A regional AED typically handles 450-500 patients daily, 138,000 annual presentations (AEIS, 2006) . In a resuscitation room, we have adopted a multidisciplinary approach to care for critically ill patients. The system is similar to the USA, UK or Australia, and aims at providing holistic care to critical care patients efficiently. The trauma service in Hong Kong is a mature and efficient service with well-established protocols and guidelines to support the trauma patient from admission to AED to the trauma unit of a hospital.",

Their major role is to handle in-service specialty training within AED, to update specialty development and to carry out research. As of 2006, a total of seven nurse specialists have been appointed in the AED under the HA. Wound management remains one of the major extended roles of AED nurses, who confine themselves to manage simple wounds. Nurse initiated tetanus immunization, nurse initiated investigations such as electrocardiogram, blood glucose, and urinalysis are well implemented in all AEDs under the governance of guidelines and protocols (Hong Kong Academy of Medicine, 2006) . Nurse initiated medications such as paracetamol and ventolin inhalation are being practiced in a few AED according to protocol. However, the autonomous practice of AED nurses is comparatively lower than UK AED nurses (Reveley et al., 2001; Hong Kong Academy of Medicine, 2006 Since 2004, a new triage pain management protocol was launched and the triage nurses have the autonomy duty to initial Paracetamol for the minor musculoskeletal injury patients (Wong, 2007) . Recently, the Prince of Wales Hospital, the Academic Unit of Emergency Medicine of Chinese University of Hong Kong and Kadoorie Critical Care Fund have taken the lead to send three senior AED nurses to the UK for emergency Nurse Practitioner (ENP) training. It is a stimulating effort to further advance the role development of AED nurses of Hong Kong. A UK Emergency Nurse Practitioner (ENP) is qualified to assess, diagnose, treat and discharge patients with certain injuries in an autonomous manner (Reveley et al., 2001) . The overall responsibilities of an ENP are to provide quality minor injury services for injuries such as cuts, scalds, bites, sprains and strains. The ENPs in the UK can request and read X-rays, manage wounds, apply Plaster of Paris, remove foreign bodies, prescribe some medication such as antibiotics, tetanus and analgesics and give general advice. It is expected that the pilot program of 3 AED nurses training in the UK will lead to further continuity and success of the ENP role development in Hong Kong.",

However, it was difficult to divide time equally between academic and clinical roles as well as to perform all the expected functions at once. Nevertheless, the author truly believes that the mission of the LP role is very valuable for the benefit of nursing education and practice.

With training, a flight nurse teams up with the Government Flying Services (GFS) and the Auxiliary Medical Officer in evacuating victims, or search-and-rescue of the victims. The objectives are to provide expeditious professional medical and nursing care to people in need and to achieve maximum operational efficiency for the GFS air ambulance during casualty evacuation from remote islands. In addition, some emergency nurses have joined a newly established service: the Hospital Authority Overseas Support Team (HAOST). In response to summons from the Hong Kong Special Administration Region (HKSAR) Government, HAOST would be dispatched to overseas regions to assist Hong Kong citizens. They provide medical advice, psychological support and facilitate smooth early transfer of all surviving victims and relatives concerned. For example, in 2006, a dispatch team went to Egypt to help victims and relatives involved in a major traffic accident. On this occasion, there were 14 mortalities while others were critically injured. The Support Team quickly discovered that one patient was wrongly identified as a dead victim while another victim with head injuries was mistakenly diagnosed as being confused, but the patient was only frightened and hindered by the language barrier (Hong Kong Academy of Medicine, 2006).",

After the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, the HA learned a big lesson and started to form a HA task force on Contingency Planning for Major Events or Unexpected Disasters. For example, recently there was strong discussion and serious preparation for the 2008 Olympics and the East Asian games to be held in 2009. To face challenges, more collaboration, organization and communication are required among different disciplines in Hong Kong and China. To meet the demand, nursing training will be provided to equip AED nurses to face different challenges. However, the nursing shortage is another common headache faced by the Hong Kong health care body.",

However, nursing role development in Hong Kong is evolving and starts to chart its way to success. This role development aims to execute nurses' roles and responsibilities either independently or collaboratively with other professionals in order to meet the demand of individuals, families and the community. There are certainly great changes and more stories of successful care giving are bound to be reported in the near future. We hope that the changes will also lead to advancements in the professional status for emergency nurses.",
