            "text": "Medical waste, which contains a mass of virus, bacteria and chemical agent, is listed No.1 Hazardous Wastes at \"National Hazardous Wastes List\". The net amount of MW produced in China was approximately 670,000 tonnes in 2006, with a daily average output of 1,780 tonnes. Medical waste carries various pathogens, which could cause environmental pollution to water, air and soil and spread disease to endanger human health. If it was mishandled, the release of dioxin, heavy metals and other pollutants from disposal process could case secondary pollution to damage ecological environment. Medical waste has been listed at Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal and also concerned by Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants(hereinafter refer as 'Convention') [1] [2] There are two major medical waste disposal technologies--incineration and non-incineration technologies. Incineration technology refers to the warm disposal technology and high-temperature thermal disposal technologies. Non-incineration technology refers to the low temperature heat treatment, chemical processing technology, radiation processing technology, biological treatment technologies, and etc [3] . Before the outburst of SARS in 2003, the medical waste in China was managed and disposed in a decentralized way within hospitals. Medical waste was only simply incinerated in incinerators without necessary air pollution control devices, or mixed with municipal solid wastes and then landfill, or illegally reused and recycled. Following SARS epidemic in 2003, Chinese Government moved quickly to establish the National Plan for Construction of Facilities for Disposal of Hazardous Waste and Medical Waste, in which China is committed to construct about 300 dedicated MW disposal facilities across the country. The national survey on hazardous waste and MW disposal facilities found that there are 149 dedicated MW treatment facilities at 2004, which mainly used incineration disposal technology and only 2 facilities was used non-incineration technology. However, the operation of most of incineration facilities was not very successful and it is very difficult to change this situation. With the country ratified Convention at 2004, more and more attention was paid to dioxin release from medical waste incineration. The non-incineration technology of medical waste disposal was rapid developed within the country. Up to the end of 2010, there are more than 200 medical waste disposal facilities approved, constructed and operated within National Plan for Construction of Facilities for Disposal of Hazardous. The applied technologies were included pyrolysis incineration, rotary kiln incineration, autoclave, chemistry disinfection, and microwave and its combination of technology. The distribution of incineration technology and non-incineration technology in these facilities was around 50% each [4] . ",

The BAT/BEP guidelines systemicly illustrated different incineration techniques, has listed the process design and operating parameters to rotary kilin, pyrolysis, fluidized bed, and etc incinerators, and also give related requirements of medical waste process of generation, collection, segragation, storage, tranportation, treatment and final disposal. In addition, BAT/BEP guildlines illustrated the alternative technologies of medical waste treatment, such as autoclave, micorwave and so on, and suggested priortize alternative technology when build a new disposal facility.

After high temperature flu gas enter waste heat boiler, temperature was dropped from 1200 to 600 and produced 0.98 MPa steam. The steam could use for bag filter, room heating, bath water and so on. The 600 flu gas entering quenching tower, atomized cold water cooled the flu gas to 200 within 1s. And then the flu gas entered deacidity tower atomized NaOH solution will neutralize acid pollutants in flu gas. The active carbon injection with spiral plate feeder was ahead of bag filter. The active carbon was added to spiral plate and negative pressure of flu gas tunnel could suck the active carbon. Dioxin, heavy metal, smoke dust and other pollutants was absorbed and removed within bag filter. Purified flu gas was released through 35 meters stack. 3.1.2 Major retrofit techniques a) Retrofit auto control system of major equipment. Add new meter for pyrolysis incinerator, enhance control to adjust to great change of medical wastes heat value. Retrofit auto control meter of quenching tower to adapt great change of flu gas and prevent over spray or less spray. Add new meter for deacidity tower to realize the dynamic control with flu gas flow, flu gas temperature, acid gas concentration and insure the deacidify result. b) Change bags of bag filter. Use Acid and alkali resistant new coated filter material and utilize waste boiler to heat bag filter. Maintain the temperature inside bag filter higher than dew-point temperature of flu gas20 30 . Amplify the pressure of pulse injection and use online ask removal method to extend the lifetime of filter. c) Add refractory material to flue. Add refractory material to flue and stack to reduce the corrosion within the system and extend the lifetime of the flue and stack. d) Add one Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) tower.

However, the total operation situation is not optimized. The problem such as failure to continuous operation, system corrosion, high energy consumption, frequent equipment instrument damage, bad automatic control system performance, and on-line monitoring system failing to normal running, were exposed. Reaching dioxin emission standard situation is not optimistic. The urgency of dioxin control of incineration system has become increasingly prominent. Guidance on Strengthening Dioxins Pollution Prevention and Control clearly pointed out the dioxin release reduction of prioritized sector will be 10%. Guidance on Strengthening Dioxins Pollution Prevention and Control for Medical Waste Disposal was issued at end of 2011. Hazardous waste incineration pollution control standard is under revising. It is planned to adjust dioxin release concentration from 0.5 ngTEQ/Nm 3 to 0.1ngTEQ/Nm 3 . The exiting medical waste incineration disposal facility is facing the urgent need of retrofitting and optimizing.",
