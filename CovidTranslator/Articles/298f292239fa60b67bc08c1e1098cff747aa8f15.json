We find that NTZ enhances retinoic-acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I)-like-receptor, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, interferon regulatory factor 3, and interferon activities and induces transcription of the antiviral phosphatase GADD34. NTZ significantly inhibits EBOV replication in human cells through its effects on RIG-I and protein kinase R (PKR), suggesting that it counteracts EBOV VP35 protein's ability to block RIG-I and PKR sensing of EBOV. NTZ also inhibits a second negative-strand RNA virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), through RIG-I and GADD34, but not PKR, consistent with VSV's distinct host innate immune evasion mechanisms. Thus, NTZ counteracts varied virus-specific immune evasion strategies by generally enhancing the RNA sensing and interferon axis that is triggered by foreign cytoplasmic RNA exposure, and holds promise as an oral therapy against EBOV.",

For example, Ebola virus (EBOV) relies on its structural protein VP35 to inhibit viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing by retinoic-acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I) (Cardenas et al., 2006; Leung et al., 2010; Luthra et al., 2013) and the IFN-inducible double-stranded (ds)RNA sensor protein kinase R (PKR) (Feng et al., 2007; Schumann et al., 2009) , thus avoiding the triggering and amplification of the host type I IFN response. The critical role played by VP35 in productive EBOV infection was underscored by the finding that mutations introduced into VP35 that disrupted its ability to sequester viral RNA intermediates, which did not affect its function in EBOV replication, resulted in increased type I IFN induction in vitro and severely attenuated viral growth in vivo in mice (Hartman et al., 2008) and guinea pigs . A host-directed therapy that could overcome this potent VP35-dependent EBOV immune evasion strategy would thus be particularly useful.",

NTZ and its circulating metabolite tizoxanide (TIZ) have also been reported to inhibit a diverse array of viruses in tissue culture and in small animal models (Rossignol, 2014) . In humans, NTZ reduces symptom duration of uncomplicated influenza (Haffizulla et al., 2014) , viral gastroenteritis (Rossignol and El-Gohary, 2006) , and rotaviral diarrhea . Several mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to NTZ's activity against specific viruses (Ashiru et al., 2014; La Frazia et al., 2013; Li et al., 2017; Piacentini et al., 2018; Rossignol et al., 2009b; Sekiba et al., 2018) , including studies showing enhancement or induction of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression by NTZ (Gekonge et al., 2015; Petersen et al., 2016; Trabattoni et al., 2016) and studies showing a weak association between NTZ and PKR activation (Ashiru et al., 2014; Elazar et al., 2009 ). However, no functional link between NTZ's antiviral activity and any specific ISG or with PKR has been demonstrated, and the molecular mechanisms underlying its broad-spectrum antiviral effects on host cells remain unknown.",

Based on these data, we hypothesized that NTZ could limit or overcome EBOV's ability to evade detection by critical innate immune sensors following viral entry. At concentrations reflective of routine oral dosing for parasitic infections, NTZ significantly inhibits EBOV replication in A549 cells. Furthermore, using CRISPR/dead (d) Cas9-KRAB promoter targeting to ablate expression of individual host factors, we show that NTZ's inhibitory effect against EBOV relies on both RIG-I and PKR, indicating that NTZ can overcome EBOV VP35's ability to prevent viral detection by these cytoplasmic sensors. We also show that NTZ significantly inhibits a second negative-strand RNA virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), through a distinct mechanism involving both RIG-I and GADD34, but not PKR, consistent with the different innate immune evasion strategies employed by VSV when compared with EBOV. Thus, NTZ establishes a broad ''antiviral'' milieu that is rapidly amplified upon viral infection and is capable of counteracting varied virus-specific immune evasion strategies, such as those employed by EBOV and VSV.",

To determine if NTZ can directly augment IRF3's activity, we next transfected HEK293T cells with a plasmid encoding phosphomimetic IRF3, which is able to drive IFN-b mRNA expression in the absence of proximal components of the RLR signaling pathway (Lin et al., 1998) . As shown in Figure 1D , NTZ enhanced IRF3-induced IFN-b reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we also found that NTZ enhanced type I IFN-induced transcription of the ISGs Mx1, IFI27, and IFITM3 ( Figure 1E ).

To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of NTZ to inhibit infectious EBOV growth in human pulmonary epithelial A549 cells in vitro under biosafety level 4 conditions using an isolate of infectious EBOV from the original 1995 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Kikwit). Cells were pretreated with 0, 20, or 40 mM NTZ, which is not toxic to A549 cells (see Figure 3A ), for 4 h, and were then infected with EBOV at an MOI of 0.01. As shown in Figure 2 , in vehicle-only treated cells, EBOV growth increased by over 1.5 log units by 72 h post-infection. By contrast, over the same time frame, EBOV growth was completely inhibited in cells treated with 20 or 40 mM of NTZ (p < 0.001), dropping 2.5 log units from the initial inoculum titer in the cells treated with 40 mM NTZ (p < 0.001). We note that 20 and 40 mM are concentrations of NTZ that are either well below or equivalent to peak plasma levels ($39 mM) of its active metabolite TIZ that are observed in humans who have ingested 500 mg of NTZ twice a day in a typical oral regimen for cryptosporidial diarrhea (Romark, 2017) .",

Because traditional short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based methods of gene knockdown, including in A549 cells, are associated with both non-specific type I IFN induction by the shRNA itself, and reduced shRNA activity in response to type I IFN stimulation (Machitani et al., 2017) , we chose to knockdown RIG-I or PKR expression in A549 cells by targeting dead(d)Cas9-KRAB to their genes' promoters (see Transparent Methods and Figure S1 for gRNA target sequences and Figure 3B for protein knockdown efficiency).

By contrast, in the case of VSV, NTZ-mediated amplification of RIG-I signaling and induction of GADD34 expression, both contribute to the drug's anti-VSV activity.

Furthermore, mutations in the dsRNA-binding pocket of EBOV VP35 were found to increase type I IFN induction in vitro and severely attenuate viral growth in vivo (Hartman et al., 2008; Prins et al., 2010) . However, the relative importance of individual dsRNA-triggered cytoplasmic sensors for control of EBOV replication has not been clearly delineated. Our data here show that dCas9-KRAB-mediated knockdown of either RIG-I or PKR in A549 cells leads to a significant increase in EBOV replication ($1 log) after 72 h, directly demonstrating that both these host molecules contribute to control of EBOV growth. The fact that a wild-type clinical EBOV isolate with an intact VP35 as part of its genome is still susceptible to the effects of RIG-I and PKR underscores the critical roles played by both these factors in host control of EBOV. Furthermore, our data showing that NTZ's efficacy against EBOV is reduced when host cell expression of either PKR or RIG-I is ablated, indicates that the ability of NTZ to increase the activity of PKR and RIG-I at an early stage of EBOV infection, can tip the balance in favor of the host by blunting VP35's ability to suppress the innate immune response.",

            "text": "NTZ also suppressed VSV replication, and its antiviral efficacy was markedly reduced upon depletion of RIG-I in A549 cells. However, unlike what we observed for EBOV, knockdown of PKR had no effect on NTZ inhibition of VSV. Furthermore, in the absence of NTZ, we found that knockdown of PKR resulted in a significant but milder increase in VSV growth relative to the robust increase in EBOV replication we observed when PKR expression was ablated. We note that the VSV matrix protein blocks host cell type I IFN responses independently of PKR by inhibiting global mRNA synthesis and nuclear export, as well as by inhibiting global host protein synthesis (Ahmed et al., 2003; Black and Lyles, 1992; Connor and Lyles, 2005; Ferran and Lucas-Lenard, 1997; von Kobbe et al., 2000) . The VSV matrix protein shuts down host cell translation primarily by inducing dephosphorylation of the eIF4F initiation complex component eIF4E Lyles, 2002, 2005) . However, eIF2a also becomes phosphorylated at later stages of VSV infection, leading to additional negative effects on host protein synthesis, including on type I IFN production, as well as on viral protein synthesis (Connor and Lyles, 2005) . Here, we have shown that NTZ induces transcription and translation of GADD34, which is a phosphatase that reverses eIF2a phosphorylation (Novoa et al., 2001) , and has been shown to be critical for restoring translation of IFN-b and other selected cytokines in virus-infected cells (Clavarino et al., 2012a (Clavarino et al., , 2012b Dalet et al., 2017) . Given that GADD34 depletion reduces NTZ activity against VSV, our data suggest that NTZ induction of GADD34 further amplifies NTZ-augmented RIG-I signaling, providing cells with the capacity to mount an innate immune response that is sufficient to overcome VSV matrix protein inhibitory effects upon protein synthesis.",

NTZ also enhanced type I IFN-induced mRNA synthesis of ISGs Mx1, IFI27, and IFITM3. IFITM3 is a critical restriction factor for both EBOV (Huang et al., 2011) and VSV (Huang et al., 2011; Weidner et al., 2010) , and Mx1 has been shown to inhibit VSV infection (Staeheli and Pavlovic, 1991) .

For example, one report described increased average expression of a panel of 26 ISGs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) treated with a very low concentration (0.1 mM) of NTZ for an unspecified time, with no functional demonstration of how any of these individual ISGs affected replication of a virus in NTZ-treated cells (Petersen et al., 2016) . Another article reported that treatment of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) with NTZ for 48 h induced the expression of the ISGs tetherin and APOBEC3A/G, and although the authors associated this with NTZ inhibition of HIV in MDMs, no functional demonstration was provided showing that these molecules played any role in NTZ's anti-HIV activity (Gekonge et al., 2015) . A third study reported that TIZ treatment of human PBMCs for 7 days induced a set of 14 IFNs and ISGs approximately 2-fold when compared with untreated PBMCs, with a slightly greater increase, on average, observed in the context of HIV infection (including Mx1, 1.8to 2.9-fold respectively); however, again, no functional links between the ISGs identified and NTZ inhibition of HIV replication were made, and no mechanism for this response was investigated (Trabattoni et al., 2016) . In contrast to the above studies, through both biochemical and gene knockdown approaches we have demonstrated that NTZ treatment results in broad amplification of RLR pathway components that are primary drivers of type I IFN production and ISG induction and amplifies type I IFN signaling. Furthermore, we have functionally linked RIG-I and PKR to NTZ's antiviral activity against EBOV, and functionally linked RIG-I and GADD34 to NTZ's activity against VSV using CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB-mediated knockdown of these molecules in host cells.",

However, because RLRs are expressed in most human tissues and the inflammatory response to their induction is highly variable person to person, there is concern that therapeutic approaches employing RNA agonists will be associated with unacceptable inflammatory side effects (Elion and Cook, 2018). Intriguingly, NTZ has been used extensively with an excellent safety profile in adults and children for treatment of parasitic infections (Doumbo et al., 1997; Hussar, 2004; Rossignol et al., 1998) , and for viral diseases such as HCV (Rossignol et al., 2008 (Rossignol et al., , 2009a and influenza (Haffizulla et al., 2014) . Notably, our findings indicate that NTZ modulate the innate immune response after a pathogen has entered a susceptible target cell, when amplification of natural immune control of viral infection is needed. In the case of viruses like EBOV that employ immune evasion mechanisms to avoid triggering the innate immune response, such a therapeutic profile is attractive. Although identification of NTZ's upstream target is outside the scope of this article, we anticipate that these studies, which are underway, will be of great value in unraveling host pathways that lead to cell-intrinsic control of Ebola.",

Furthermore, the detailed investigation of NTZ's upstream target in the regulation of the immune responses described here is outside the scope of this article and will be the subject of future studies, as will in vivo testing of NTZ against EBOV.",

The medium was changed 4 hours post-transfection with DMEM containing 1% FBS and the indicated concentration of NTZ. Cells were lysed ~20 hr post-stimulation and IFN promoter activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter assay (Promega) and a Synergy2 plate reader (BioTek). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized against Renilla luciferase activity.To measure endogenous IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels upon 1AB stimulation, HEK 293T cells in 48-well plates were pre-treated with the indicated concentration of NTZ in DMEM containing 1% FBS. Four hours after addition of NTZ, cells were transfected with 200 ng of 1AB. RNA was extracted 20 hours after stimulation using Tri Reagent and Direct-zol RNA miniprep (Zymo Research). cDNA was prepared using the Highcapacity RT kit (Applied Biosystems) with random primers, and qPCR was done using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). For paracrine stimulation of the IFN pathway, HEK 293T cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. As described above, the next day the medium was changed with DMEM containing 1% FBS and the indicated concentration of NTZ for 4 hrs, followed by stimulation with 10 ng/mL recombinant human IFN-\u03b2 (PeproTech),. Cells were harvested ~20 hr poststimulation and qPCR was performed as described above. CT values were normalized to Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Relative quantification was calculated by the comparative CT method and is shown as fold change of expression(2 \u2212\u0394\u0394CT ).To test if NTZ induces GADD34 gene expression, A549 cells grown in 10% FBS/DMEM were switched to 1% FBS/DMEM for 1 hour and then treated with 0, 10, 20, or 30 \u00b5M NTZ for 4 hours, followed by RNA isolation and oligoDT-based cDNA synthesis. CT values were normalized to cyclophilin A as a housekeeping gene and relative quantitation of GADD34 mRNA levels was performed as described above.Effect of NTZ on VSV-Luc replication in A549 cellsA549 cells were maintained as described above and treated with vehicle or increasing concentrations of NTZ up to 30 \u00b5M for 4 hrs. Next, cells were infected with VSV-Luc (a gift from Martin Dorf) and 16 hrs post-infection cells were lysed and firefly luciferase activity was measured as directed by the manufacturer (Biotium).Efficacy of NTZ pre-treatment on inhibition of VSV-Luc infection was compared in the CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB control, PKR-KD, RIG-I-KD, and GADD34-KD A549 cell lines (see cell line description below) as described above for wild-type A549 cells. In all cases, equivalent numbers of each cell line were seeded one day prior to NTZ treatment and subsequent VSV-Luc infection.",

For GADD34 detection, CRISPR-control and CRISPR-GADD34 cells were stimulated by tunicamycin (TN) at 10 \u00b5g/ml or NTZ at 25 \u00b5M for 8 hours then harvested and used for Western blotting. Cell pellets were lysed in Laemmli buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 2.5% betamercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromophenol blue; BIO-RAD) for 30 min in presence of protease inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific), boiled for 5 min at 100\u00baC, and subjected to Western blot analysis.
