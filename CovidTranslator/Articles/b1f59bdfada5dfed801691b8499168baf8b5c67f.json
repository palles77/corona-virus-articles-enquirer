            "text": "S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious interstitial pneumonia that causes death in a considerable portion of patients. The first epidemic of SARS began in November 2002 in southern China, spread to all five continents, and was interrupted in July 2003. It caused 774 deaths among the 8,098 cases. Two laboratory-associated infections and four new isolated cases have since occurred (1) . SARS is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that is shed in patients' respiratory secretions after infection (2) (3) (4) (5) . Immune response to SARS-CoV appears with a latency of up to 4 weeks from infection, and the concentration of virus particles varies greatly between patients or types of clinical samples. Thus achieving a reliable virologic diagnosis early after disease onset is difficult. Highly sensitive methods for virus detection, such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are required to confirm SARS in the acute phase and prevent transmission.",

The supernatants were heated to 56\u00b0C for 1 h and \u03b3 irradiated with 30 kGy. Residual infectivity was excluded by Vero cell cultures (3 passages). Aliquots of the inactivated virus stock solutions were lyophilized and redissolved, and the virus RNA was quantified by two different noncommercial real-time RT-PCR assays (2, 6) . Virion integrity was confirmed by morphology by electron microscopy (data not shown). Test samples for the study were generated by diluting the inactivated virus stock solutions in human fresh-frozen plasma testing negative for HIV-1, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and SARS-CoV by RT-PCR. Aliquots of 100 \u00b5L each were then lyophilized and shipped at ambient temperature to the participating laboratories. Each participant received a coded panel of seven positive and three negative samples. Virus-positive samples contained 94-940,000 RNA copies per milliliter after resuspending in 100 \u00b5L of water. The participants were asked to analyze the material with the molecular methods they routinely use in suspected cases in humans. Details about the methods were requested, such as the sources of RT-PCR primers and protocols, the type of extraction method used, and suppliers and types of commercial kits, if used. The following two criteria were chosen as minimum requirements for overall proficiency. First, laboratories had to correctly detect the four samples containing >9,400 copies of viral RNA per milliliter, a concentration well above the detection limit of published and commercial nucleic acid amplification tests (NAT) for SARS-CoV, (6, 7, (10) (11) (12) . Second, no false-positive results were allowed with the negative samples. Indeterminate results in positive samples were treated as negative and in negative samples were treated as positive since the application of NAT usually does not involve indeterminate endpoints, and laboratories should be able to resolve unclear results by double testing with another amplification assay (13) .",

This finding was in concordance with results of the four participating companies who manufacture these kits: all were 100% correct. Fourteen of 58 participants used commercial test kits. For noncommercial tests, whether laboratories developed primers themselves or adapted from other researchers did not make a difference.
