In daily life and in clinical practice we are forced to use our imagination to understand how our behaviour influences and is influenced by them. Read this paragraph, then close your eyes and think through the following: inside your intestines, in your mouth and on your skin, there reside more than 100 000 000 000 000 microbial cells -100-fold more than the number of cells that make up the human body. We are not conscious of these companions any more than we are conscious of passing them round every time we shake hands, speak or touch a surface. Inoculation with just one microbe of the wrong type in the wrong way may kill you, yet we tolerate and indeed thrive on constant appropriate exposure to this unseen world. Because microbes are generally hidden from our senses, an appreciation of microbiology and infection demands imagination. Our forebears who established the discipline lavished imagination on the problems they studied. Sadly it is that lack of imagination that now underpins serious problems such as hospitalacquired infection and antibiotic resistance.",

The conquest of epidemic and fatal infections has sometimes seemed so conclusive that infections may be dismissed as of minor concern to modern doctors in wealthy countries. However, infection is far from defeated. In resource-poor countries, an estimated 10 million young children die each year from the effects of infectious diarrhoea, measles, malaria, tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough alone. Many other classical scourges, such as tuberculosis, cholera, typhoid and leprosy, continue to take their toll. Although we have the potential to prevent nearly all of these deaths, political and social issues constantly hinder progress, and more effective and economic means of delivery provide a constant challenge.",

The revolution in molecular biology that followed the elucidation of the structure of DNA by James Watson, Francis Crick, Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin in 1953 ultimately enabled a leap forward in analytical capability. For three decades this did not radically change the understanding of microbes and infection. However, almost exactly a century after Pasteur and Koch initiated what has been called the 'golden era of bacteriology', three interconnected breakthroughs once again altered the perspective: to establish antisepsis, aimed at destroying the micro-organisms responsible for infection during surgery. The other great founding father of medical microbiology, Robert Koch, came to microbiology through medicine. Working originally as a country doctor in East Prussia, he established the techniques required to isolate and propagate pure cultures of specific bacteria. His numerous contributions include establishment of the bacterial causes of anthrax, tuberculosis and cholera. He also formulated more precisely proposals first put forward by one of his mentors, Jacob Henle (1809-1885), describing how specific microbes might be recognized as the cause of specific diseases.

When treatment of infection later became reliable and routine, hygiene standards were often allowed to drop, leading to present problems, notably with hospital-acquired infection. The discovery of phagocytic cells and humoral immunity (antibodies) as natural defence mechanisms at the end of the nineteenth century led to a re-assessment of the response to infection. One outcome was the use of antibodies produced in one host for the protection of another (serum therapy). This produced some spectacular successes, notably in the life-saving use of antitoxin in diphtheria and tetanus. Unfortunately these foreign proteins often caused hypersensitivity reactions (serum sickness) and few diseases responded reliably to serum therapy. Nevertheless, the capacity of the immune system to achieve selective toxicity, and observations by the brilliant German doctor Paul Ehrlich that dyes used to stain infected tissues selectively labelled parasites in preference to host tissues, contributed to the notion that systemic chemotherapy might be achievable.",

A more important breakthrough than Ehrlich's came in 1935 with the publication of a paper by Gerhard Domagk (1895-1964) of the German dyestuffs consortium, IG Farbenindustrie. Domagk described the remarkable activity against streptococci of a dye derivative, prontosil, which turned out to owe its activity to a sulphonamide substituent previously unsuspected of antibacterial activity. Earlier, in 1928, Alexander Fleming had accidentally discovered the antibacterial properties of a fungal mould Penicillium notatum, but he was unable to purify the active component or exploit the therapeutic potential of his discovery. This was left to a team of scientists at Oxford led by the Australian experimental pathologist Howard Florey (1898-1968), heralding the start of the antibiotic era -the most important therapeutic development of the twentieth century.",

The hunt for antibiotics intensified after the Second World War, yielding chloramphenicol, tetracyclines and many other natural, synthetic and relationships. It transpires that all cellular forms of life can be classified according to the DNA sequence encoding their rRNA (rDNA). Determination of this sequence provides a means of identifying all microbes and has led to the discovery of a previously unsuspected third 'domain' of life, the Archaea (see Ch. 2). 2. Technological advances made possible by molecular genetics. The molecular basis for the pathogenesis of infection now enables recognition of the specific roles of individual genes and their products in both the pathogen and the host. This offers the promise of new approaches to treatment and prevention of infection. The discovery of mobile genetic elements that convey genes from one organism to another (see Ch. 6) confronted our biological sense of what makes up an individual. Mobile bacterial genes encoding antibiotic resistance present a major problem to the practice of medicine. 3. The development of ultra-sensitive means of detecting specific DNA or RNA sequences and the development, by Kary Mullis, of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 1986. The analytical capacity of nucleic acid amplification techniques offers the prospect that it may be possible to diagnose microbial disease routinely by these methods. However, there are many challenges to be met before this shift away from detection of micro-organisms by isolation in laboratory cultures can be accepted.",

Before the advent of antibiotics, habitat(s). These may or may not be the same as the immediate source but, in considering the control of infection, the natural habitat of the causal organism constitutes the reservoir of infection. These points are illustrated in Figure 1 .2. Elimination of the organism from the reservoir will lead to eradication of the infection, whereas elimination from the immediate source, if this is distinct from the reservoir, provides one means by which control of infection can be achieved. The mode of transmission can involve: other infected individuals in the case of contagious infections; food in the case of foodborne infections; water in waterborne infection; aerosol generation by an infected individual; or contamination of an inanimate object (fomites) such as medical equipment or bed linen. The possible sources and modes of transmission of infection are enormous, and new variants are continually being recognized.

Microbes that depend on human beings are obligate parasites. A few actually need to cause disease to propagate themselves; these are termed obligate pathogens. In most cases, disease is accidental, or even detrimental, to the microbe's long-term survival. Viruses that cause disease in man are obligate parasites, although they often cause inapparent, subclinical or asymptomatic infection. Many viruses rely on infecting a particular host species.

Most are harmless or even beneficial. Those that cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals are termed pathogens. The normal microbiota constitutes the reservoir and immediate source for endogenous infection. Infections in which the source of the causal organism is external are termed exogenous infections. \u2022 Many infections can now be treated with antimicrobial agents that possess selective toxicity. None the less, infection remains the most common cause of morbidity and premature death in the world.",
