Conventionally reared oneday-old mice (strain ddY), rats and Syrian hamsters were each inoculated with 0.01-ml of the viral materials by the intracerebral (ic) route and with 0.02-ml by the subcutaneous (s.c.) route. Virus recovery and infectivity assay were carried out. by inoculation into cell cultures of BEK-1 ecll, derived from bovine embryonic kidney (3). The a:nti-Kakegawa strain immune serum having a homologous neutralizing antibody titer of 4096 was prepared in specific germ-free rabbits with virus grown in BEK-1 cells as described previously (1), and the anti-mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain 2 rabbit immune serum having a neutralizing antibody titer of about 10,000 by 50 per cent plaque reduction neutralization test was kindly supplied by Dr. K. Fujiwara, University of Tokyo, Japan. Neutralization (NT) test was carried out by the method described previously (1) . Viruses recovered from the brains of affected animals containing 200 TCIDs0 were mixed with an equal volume of two-fold serum dilutions. Each mixture was assayed for infectivity by using two tubes of BEK-1 cell cultures per dilution. The antibody titer was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that showed no cytopathic changes in at least, one of the two tubes. Fig. 1 . Four-day-old mouse 3 days after intraeerebral inoculation with the 3rd mouse brain passaged Kakegawa strain (left) and an uninoeulated 4-day-old mouse (right) Four litters (10 to 12/litter) of suckling mice were inoculated intracerebrally with infected tissue culture fluid containing 106-5 TCID50/ml. At daily intervals, four animals were sacrificed and their brains taken. The inoculated animals developed an illness 4 days post-inoculation (p. i.) and began to die at 5 days p. i. The affected animals became anemic and showed mild neural symptoms such as weak limbs and sluggish staggering gait. The virus titers of infected brains rose at 2 days p. i. with a subsequent gradual rise to a maximum of 10 s.~ TCIDs0/g at 5 days p. i. Serial passage in suckling mice was readily accomplished by the i. c. route with 10 per cent, (w/v) brain emulsions (Fig. 1) . The incubation period fell to 2 to 3 days by the 3rd passage. Uninoculated mice and mice inoculated with normal brain emulsions remained healthy. Virus at the 3rd passage level in suckling mice containing 105.2 TCIDs0/ml also produced a clinical illness with the same symptoms described above. It caused death in all animals when ineoulated into one litter of suckling mice (10/litter) by the s.c. route, and into rats (9 or 12/litter) and hamsters (7 or 8/litter) by the i.e. or s.c. route.
