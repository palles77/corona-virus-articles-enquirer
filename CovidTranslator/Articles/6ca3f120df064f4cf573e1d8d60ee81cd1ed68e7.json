            "text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common viral pathogen that causes lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children globally. In this study, we developed a duplex reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification (duplex-rtRAA) assay containing an internal control in a single closed tube for the detection of human RSV. The internal control in the amplification effectively eliminated false-negative results and ensured the accuracy of the duplex-rtRAA system. We first developed and evaluated a universal singleplex-rtRAA assay for RSV. The sensitivity of this assay for RSV was determined as 4.4 copies per reaction, and the specificity was 100%. Next, a duplex-rtRAA assay with an internal control was established. The sensitivity of the duplex-rtRAA assay approached 5.0 copies per reaction, and no cross-reaction with other common respiratory viruses was observed. The two detection methods (singleplex-rtRAA and duplex-rtRAA) developed in this study were used to test 278 clinical specimens, and the results showed absolute consistency with RSV RT-qPCR analysis, demonstrating 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. These data indicate that the duplex-rtRAA has great potential for the rapid detection of RSV with a high sensitivity.",

Some research has indicated that pneumonia and bronchitis in infants is more frequently caused by RSV than by any other pathogenic microorganisms in most areas [4] . RSV is an enveloped virus belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae that has a single-stranded nonsegmented negative-sense RNA. There are two distinct groups (A and B) of RSV, which are distinguished by antigenic and genetic variations [5] . Respiratory infection of RSV may lead to bronchitis, bronchial pneumonia and severe pneumonia and can even be life-threatening. RSV pneumonia is difficult to distinguish from pneumonia caused by influenza virus or adenovirus based on clinical symptoms. Currently, there are still no effective vaccines and treatments [6] . Therefore, rapid and accurate detection of RSV is of great importance not only for monitoring and controlling the prevalence of RSV but also for providing reliable laboratory evidence for early clinical diagnosis and selection of the appropriate treatment [7, 8] .",

Although cell culture is considered the gold standard for virus detection with high specificity, its low sensitivity and time required limit its application in clinical diagnosis. Serological detection also has the disadvantage of low sensitivity. In recent years, RT-PCR, with high sensitivity and specificity, has gradually become a mainstream method of pathogen detection [14] . However, RT-PCR requires specialized technical expertise, a dedicated laboratory, and expensive thermocycling equipment, and it is also time-consuming and costly, which is not conducive to its widespread use in conventional laboratories and in low-resource areas. The isothermal amplification technique, which was developed in recent years, provides an alternative to PCR technology [15] . Examples of isothermal nucleic acid amplification techniques include nucleicacid-sequence-based amplification (NASBA) [16, 17] , loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [18, 19] , helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) [20] , recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) [21] , and recombinaseaided amplification (RAA) [22, 23] . These methods do not require thermocycling. Unlike other isothermal amplification techniques, RAA does not require an initial denaturation step to separate double-stranded DNA. The basic RAA assay includes two specific primers and three core proteins (recombinase UvsX from Escherichia coli, DNA polymerase, and single-strand DNA binding protein [SSB]), and the reaction is carried out at 37-42 \u00b0C within 30 minutes. The real-time RAA reaction system additionally includes a novel exo oligonucleotide probe and exonuclease III in addition to the basic system.",

As shown in Table 3 , 102 (102/278) RSV specimens were detected by both rtRAA assays, and the results were in agreement with those obtained by RT-qPCR, which also showed 102 RSV-positive specimens. The CT values of these 102 samples ranged from 17.90 to 35.63. The results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of both rtRAA assays was 100% consistent with RT-qPCR when testing clinical samples. IC amplification signals were detected not only with the 102 RSV-positive specimens but also with the other 176 non-RSV specimens and with each NTC, indicating that the RSVIC worked effectively. The kappa values (\u03ba) for RT-qPCR and singleplex-rtRAA or duplex-rtRAA were both 1 (p \u2264 0.001), revealing that there were no significant differences between the two In the presence of a series of concentrations of RSV plasmids, IC (100 copies) amplification signals appeared at approximately the same time. However, when the RSV plasmid concentration increased, the fluorescence intensity of the IC decreased. In the presence of 10 4 -10 0 copies of RSV plasmid per reaction, no significant competitive inhibition was observed in the amplification of the IC. In the presence of 10 5 copies of RSV plasmid per reaction, the amplification of IC was significantly inhibited rtRAA assays and the RT-qPCR assay for detecting RSV. The cycle threshold (CT) values of the RT-qPCR and the threshold time (TT) values of the duplex-rtRAA were well correlated, with an R 2 value of 83.1 (Fig. S2 ). Rapid and accurate diagnosis of RSV infection is necessary to monitor and control RSV epidemics in clinical settings and to investigate outbreaks. Point-of-care testing (POCT) is no doubt the most powerful tool in this regard because of its advantages of portability of experimental instruments, simple operation and real-time reporting of results. Our duplex-rtRAA assay takes only 20 minutes to obtain a positive result, whereas RT-qRCR usually requires 1-3 hours. Moreover, PCR also requires a professional operator, a special experiment configuration, and thermocycling equipment to achieve high precision, which are major obstacles to its application in the field for POCT. In the present study, the duplex-rtRAA assay for RSV achieved a level of sensitivity and specificity comparable to that of RT-qPCR. The characteristics of rapidity, portability of the instrument, labor saving, and low cost, combined with the use of lyophilized reagents, which are convenient for storage and transport, give the duplex-rtRAA assay great potential for application in the field for POCT for clinical diagnosis of RSV.",

Since the RAA reaction is an enzymatic reaction controlled by a variety of enzymes, it is more susceptible to the influence of inhibitors in the specimen. Different from previous studies, we added an IC to achieve optimal conditions for experimental operation and to monitor possible inhibitory reactions in the experiment, in order eliminate false-negative results and to improve the reliability of the assay. There are two main types of ICs: competitive and non-competitive. Non-competitive ICs require different primers and probes for each reaction, and due to the differences in the primer sequences, amplification of non-competitive sequences may not accurately reflect the amplification of the primary target [30] . In order to avoid the risk of unnecessary interactions of multiple primers, we used a competitive IC method to amplify the target and IC with a set of common primers in the same reaction tube under the same conditions. In this case, the only sequence difference between the RSV sequence and RSVIC sequence was in the probe-binding region. In contrast to another reported competitive IC method [31] , this strategy allowed the RAA to amplify the target and RSVIC simultaneously, ensuring to the maximum extent the same competitiveness and amplification efficiency. Normally, a competitive IC reduces the efficiency of amplification of the target, which in turn affects the sensitivity of detection. In the duplex-rtRAA assay, we determined the optimal concentration of IC (100 copies per reaction). At this concentration, the stability of the duplex-rtRAA assay was confirmed, while the sensitivity of detection of the RSV was not affected. The interpretation of the results obtained using the duplex-rtRAA assay is as follows: 1) If both the target pathogen and IC are amplified, the result should be regarded as positive. 2) If the IC is amplified but the target pathogen is not, this result should be regarded as negative. 3) If the target pathogen is amplified but the IC is not, the result should be regarded as positive because this result might be due a the high concentration of target pathogen competitively inhibiting the amplification of the IC [30] . 4) If neither the target pathogen nor the IC is amplified, the result indicates that the reaction was inhibited and the test results for this sample are invalid [30] .",

Our rtRAA assay for detecting RSV was also developed targeting this locus and both the singleplex-rtRAA assay and the duplex-rtRAA assay showed excellent sensitivity, reproducibility and specificity. The sensitivity of the duplex-rtRAA assay was 5.0 copies per reaction as determined by probit analysis of the results of eight runs, which is sufficiently sensitive for detection. Our specificity test was performed by testing 176 clinical specimens containing non-RSV respiratory pathogens. No nonspecific amplification or detection was found, indicating that there was no cross-detection of other respiratory viruses. In order to verify the diagnostic applicability and the clinical effectiveness of the methods established in this study, 278 clinical specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested simultaneously by the two rtRAA assays and RT-qPCR, which was used as a reference. The results from the two assays were 100% consistent with those from RT-qPCR, indicating that the performance of both methods is satisfactory. Therefore, we believe that our duplex-rtRAA is a reliable method for identification of RSV.",
