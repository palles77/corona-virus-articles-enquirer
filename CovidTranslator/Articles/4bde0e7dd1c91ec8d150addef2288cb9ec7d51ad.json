User acceptance of these devices is 1 potential barrier to implementing such a strategy in respiratory protection programs. Methods: To assess user attitudes toward various respirators, health care workers enrolled in respiratory protection programs in a medical system using EHFRs, N95s, and PAPRs and completed an online questionnaire that addressed attitudes, beliefs, and respirator preferences under different risk scenarios. Responses were compared between user groups. Results: Of 1,152 participants, 53% currently used N95s, 24% used EHFRs, and 23% used PAPRs. N95 users rated their respirators more favorably compared with EHFR and PAPR users (P < .001) regarding comfort and communication, however, EHFR users rated their respirators much more highly regarding sense of protection (P < .001). For all user groups, reusable respirators were significantly more likely (odds ratios 2.3-7.7) to be preferred over N95 filtering facepiece respirators in higher risk scenarios compared to \"usual circumstance\" scenarios. Conclusions: Despite somewhat less favorable ratings on comfort and communication, experienced EHFR and PAPR users still prefer reusable respirators over N95s in certain higher risk scenarios. This suggests that reusable respirators are an acceptable alternative to N95 respirators in health care and offer 1 viable solution to prevent pandemic-generated respirator shortages.",

Conventionally, most health care settings employ the use of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (N95-FFRs) to protect their HCWs. 2 These respirators are meant to be disposable, provide protection against 95% of airborne particles as low as 0.3 microns in size, and rely on creation of a seal between the HCW's face and the mask. 3 N95-FFRs have been used in health care to protect HCWs from exposure to various pathogens, including tuberculosis (TB), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and others. 1 Over the last 20 years, all major infectious disease pandemic threats have prompted the use of respiratory protection as 1 element of a comprehensive approach to minimize risk of transmission to HCWs caring for infected patients. These events created a high demand for N95-FFRs and led to local, or even global, shortages in every case. 4, 5 During the SARS 2002 outbreak, 25% of respondents at a facility that treated at least 1 possible or confirmed SARS case experienced N95-FFR shortages. 4 With the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, hospital managers r eported shortages and many HCWs reported that N95-FFRs were not readily available. 5 The 2014 Ebola pandemic led to actual and perceived shortages of personal protective equipment overall. [6] [7] [8] [9] These shortages left HCWs less protected and, therefore, more vulnerable to the risk of occupationally acquired infection.",

However, each of these solutions also has drawbacks or violates other infection control precepts. 5, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] An additional solution to this challenge of providing adequate respiratory devices during a national or global outbreak would be to include the use of reusable respirators as part of a facility-based supply.",

Because they are reusable, they would not be disposed of after use and, therefore, would not contribute to creating a supply shortage, mitigating a demand for new respirators. One such alternative product is the reusable elastomeric half-face respirator (EHFR), a tight-fitting device with the same assigned protection factor (APF) as an N95-FFR. 16 Another example is a powered airpurifying respirator (PAPR), a loose-fitting device with a higher APF than an N95-FFR. 16 Although EHFRs are often used in other industries outside of health care (eg, manufacturing or construction) where significant airborne hazards are present, they are less familiar to most HCWs. 16 These devices are somewhat larger than N95-FFRs, made of synthetic materials such as silicone, and contain filter-bearing cartridges. Their size and appearance present challenges to user acceptance, given this unfamiliarity and perceptions related to possible discomfort during use, difficulty with communication, interference with work tasks, and potential fear experienced by patients. 17 Yet, some health care settings have used EHFRs as part of their routine or emergency protocols for respiratory protection. 2, [18] [19] [20] Understanding the experience of workers in these environments would provide insight quantifying the potential concerns about user acceptance and could guide actions to best address these concerns.",

In addition, loose-fitting PAPRs are appropriate when fit testing has not occurred, and some health care facilities may exclusively rely on PAPRs as their primary form of respiratory protection to avoid the need for fit testing. PAPRs are recommended for use during certain high-hazard tasks, such as aerosolgenerating procedures in patients suspected to have an aerosol-transmissible disease, as they provide a higher level of protection (APF \u2265 25) and have an added benefit of including facial protection. 21 These features may make PAPRs a preferred from of respiratory protection during pandemics. Although loose-fitting PAPR use does not require fit testing, training that includes appropriate donning, doffing, and use technique is still required. PAPRs have higher initial costs and may require use of product-specific auxiliary components, such as hoods. In health care, PAPR hoods are often reused among individuals for care of specific patients, but frequently are disposed of subsequently. A 2015 survey of US occupational health nurses revealed that 77% had used PAPRs in their health care facilities over the past year. 2 Therefore, PAPR users represent an important group whose comparative preferences should also be examined to understand acceptance of these devices in health care.",

Sites B and D were suburban and urban community hospitals, respectively, where the primary form of respiratory protection was N95-FFR. Site C was a suburban rural-based community hospital, where the primary form of respiratory protection used was PAPR. Site E was a collection of urban ambulatory practices affiliated with site A, where the primary form of respiratory protection was EHFR. Each site had existing RPP policies and procedures for training and fit testing as needed that complied with the OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard (29 CFR 1910.134 ). The study was approved by the University of Maryland-Baltimore institutional review board.",

First, the question, \"What respirator would you prefer to wear under usual circumstances, such as caring for a patient who is being ruled-out for TB?\" was asked. The risk scenario was then escalated to caring for a patient with known, active TB and finally to a setting of pandemic H1N1 or SARS. The majority of each user group preferred to stay with their current respirator type under usual circumstances ( Table 3) . As risk increased to exposure to active TB, however, the percentage staying with or switching to EHFR or PAPR increased in each user group. When exposure was to pandemic H1N1 or SARS, the propensity to stay with or switch to EHFR was not as strong as with exposure to active TB, but propensity to prefer PAPR was higher. For all user groups, reusable respirators were significantly more likely to be preferred over N95-FFRs in higher risk scenarios compared to usual circumstance scenarios (Table 4 ). Adjustment for covariates increased the odds of preferring either EHFR or PAPR compared to N95-FFR in all user groups and in each threat scenario compared to usual circumstances. To understand whether EHFR and PAPR users perceived their susceptibility differently than N95-FFR users, we asked participants how likely they believed they would be to contract various communicable diseases from caring for an infected patient while not wearing a respirator. Whereas most respondents reported their belief that it would be likely or very likely that they would contract TB, H1N1, SARS, or Ebola, there were no significant differences in the frequency of reporting of the different responses among the user groups (data not shown).

First, there may be greater confidence in obtaining a reliable fit, given the more durable design of the EHFR. Further, the mask has a larger surface area in contact with the face, which may promote a better seal or even a perception of a better seal. Second, the EHFR users may wear their respirators more frequently than the N95-FFR users, yielding a greater familiarity with the mask and assessment of how well it protects. When adjusted for frequency of use, however, there was still a pattern of preference for EHFR. Another hypothesis was that this EHFR preference may have been driven by a dominant choice by a specific worker group (eg, nurses compared to doctors). When we adjusted for job category, however, there was still a statistically significant preference for EHFR under increasing threat levels. Finally, we explored whether having an increased perception of risk susceptibility might influence preference for respirator type. To understand underlying perceptions among different respirator users, this study queried whether routine EHFR users were influenced more by fear of the potential diseases they could encounter, compared to N95-FFR users. They were not. They rated the likelihood of contracting TB, SARS, or Ebola when not wearing a respirator similarly to N95-FFR users, suggesting that they view the diseases themselves similarly as other respirator users.",

In the current study's population of experienced EHFR users, the comfort ratings for these devices were not dramatically different from the ratings of N95-FFRs, and mean response values fell in the neutral or positive range.

Although this does not seem to impair ultimate preference, this aspect clearly demonstrates a limitation of this device's use in the health care setting. This user rating echoes that found in the Workers' Compensation Board of British Columbia study, where speech intelligibility test scores for workers using EHFRs were lower, but still above the minimum acceptable level according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. 17 Similarly, in a study of intelligibility of words spoken when wearing EHFRs under real and simulated ambient intensive care unit noise conditions, speech intelligibility was significantly lower compared to controls and compared with other common forms of respiratory protection, but could be improved with use of a voice augmentation device. 27 The results from the current study support previous recommendations from the IOM that communication interference be rectified in the next generation of respiratory protective devices developed for HCWs. 27 However, in general, the familiar EHFR user cohort numbering several hundred still preferred this device for all threat scenarios for which they were queried.",

Communication and comfort ratings among PAPR users were the lowest of the 3 respirators. With respect to communication, in a study of different types of respirators worn by HCWs, hearing clarity while wearing a PAPR was 79% compared to 90% clarity without the use of a PAPR. 27 In another study of HCWs who had used 2 different PAPR models during the 2003 SARS outbreak, between 5% and 14% percent of respondents reported significant or unacceptable hearing impairment, only 5%-14% could speak normally when using the PAPR, and 25% reported having to raise their voice significantly. 28 These HCWs, however, had also worn N95-FFRs underneath their PAPR hoods, per hospital policy, which may have added an additional impairment to communication. Research on comfort of PAPRs, however, has produced variable results. In the study among HCWs experienced with PAPR use during SARS, the majority of respondents found PAPRs to be \"at least tolerable,\" with 23%-46% reporting them to be \"very comfortable,\" but 9%-14% reporting to be \"uncomfortable.\" Other studies have reported increased perception of facial heat and eye dryness in PAPR users. 29, 30 In the current study, PAPR users rated their respirators more favorably than N95-FFR users on sense of protection. Similarly, in the study of HCWs familiar with PAPR use during SARS, PAPRs were perceived to be more protective than N95-FFRs. 28 Of the 3 respirators queried in the current study, PAPRs have the highest APF by OSHA. In our study population, PAPR users rated their respirators slightly lower than EHFR users on their perceived level of protectiveness. This finding suggests an opportunity for improved education among HCWs on the levels of protection provided by respiratory protective equipment in general.",

In the study of HCWs experiences with PAPR use during SARS, the majority of HCWs received PAPR training by an experienced trainer, but approximately 30% received video instruction and some relied only on printed instructions. 28 There may be an additional belief in the protectiveness of a respirator that is instilled during a fit testing process, which is absent in a loose-fitting PAPR training program.",

By incorporating site, job category, and primary clinical unit, however, influences imparted by training content and delivery likely were captured. Also, the preference odds ratios indicate a preference for EHFR or PAPR in comparison to preference for N95-FFR.

We aimed to recruit at least 1,000 participants and provided gift cards for participation on a rolling basis. HCWs may have been less motivated to participate after the gift cards were exhausted. The breadth of job categories of our participants, however, suggests that an appropriately representative sample of HCWs engaged in respiratory protection activities was assembled. The number of current EHFR users is smaller than that originally anticipated and on which power calculations were based. Some of this is owing to changes in respirator assignment surrounding the time of survey deployment. For example, out of 1,152 participants, 153 reported using EHFRs in the past but were no longer using them (data not shown). Also, participants were asked what respirator they were most recently assigned to use and what respirator they usually use. To account for the small group of respondents who usually used respirators that were different from their respirator assignment, we adjusted for assigned respirator in all of our analyses, and the unadjusted outcomes did not change significantly. Because we wanted to focus on the experiences of current users, we have a smaller sample size than originally anticipated. Despite this smaller sample size, we still saw significant differences between the respirator user groups, suggesting that we were not underpowered to detect important differences.",

This suggests that EHFRs are an acceptable alternative to N95 respirators in health care and offer 1 viable solution to prevent pandemic-generated respirator shortages.
