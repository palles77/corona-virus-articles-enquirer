In this study, a scaled outdoor experiment was conducted to examine the interunit dispersion characteristics in consecutive two-dimensional street canyons. Tracer gas (CO 2 ) was continuously released to simulate the pollutant dispersion routes between the rooms in street canyons. The wind velocity, wind direction, air temperature, and tracer gas concentrations were monitored simultaneously. Two important parameters, the air exchange rate and reentry ratio, were analyzed to reveal the ventilation performance and interunit dispersion of the rooms in the street canyons. Based on the real-time weather conditions, it was found that the ventilation performance of the source room varied according to the room location. The air exchange rate distribution of the leeward-side room was more stable than that of the windward side. The tracer gas was mainly transported in the vortex direction inside the street canyon, and the highest reentry ratio was observed at the room nearest to the source room along the transportation route. In addition, under real weather conditions, the rooms in the street canyon have a high probability of experiencing a high reentry ratio based on the maximum reentry ratio of each room. This study provides authentic airflow and pollutant dispersion information in the street canyons in an urban environment. The dataset of this experiment can be used to validate further numerical simulations.",

A poor IAQ, caused by the concentrations of particulate matter and gaseous pollutants in the air, may lead to harmful consequences to human health. Various pollutants, such as traffic exhaust, dust, pollen, airborne viruses, and toxic and odorous emissions, may enter indoor areas [3] . Recently, a special mode of pollutant transmission, known as interunit dispersion, has gained popularity. Interunit dispersion illustrates the cross-transmission between apartment units within the same multistory building. This airborne transmission mode is highly risky because of the relatively short dispersion distances and transportation time as compared to other modes like pollutants from special dense sources and traffic exhausts [4] .",

Second, outbreaks of acutely infectious diseases or even the ordinary flu season [10] may result in airborne viruses or biological aerosols in the airflow, which poses a great threat to public health.

The sampling frequency was 1 Hz and the output results were averaged for 1s. The concentration of the source gas was 10 5 ppm, and the flow rate was 1:5 L=min. All instruments were sampled simultaneously for the wind velocity, wind direction, air temperature, and CO 2 concentrations in each room. After completing one test, the gas releasing tube was pulled out. The next test was not initiated until the CO 2 concentration in the former source room declined to its initial status. Each room in Building B as a source location was a single test, a total of eight tests (eight source rooms) were included as a full round of tests. During the entire experiment, a total of three full rounds of tests were conducted from June 8 to 10, 2019.

This indicated that the ventilation rates on the windward side of the street canyon were positively correlated with the height of the room. ACH * values showed that the ventilation rate of test BW1 was lowest among all of the tests. Note that previous studies [44] investigating the ventilation using CFD simulations in street canyons with an aspect ratio of 1 : 1 revealed different results: the researchers found that the rooms located on the lowest and highest floors showed the best ventilation performance. This paradox may be attributed to two reasons. First, Ai et al. [44] used an integral method to calculate the ventilation rate by integrating the mean velocities at the opening, while this experiment adopted the tracer gas method. This may cause a difference in the ventilation distributions in the street canyon. Second, in reality, irregular fluctuations of the incoming wind may lead to complex airflow in the street canyon. Steady-state CFD simulations were unable to account for the instant fluctuations near the openings at the middle height of the street canyon and underestimated the ventilation rate.",

Several observations can be made from the comparisons of these tests. First, when the source was located on the windward side, the reentry ratio of each room was generally lower than that of the leeward side. This may be partly attributed to the fact that the average incoming wind velocities during the windward tests were higher than those of the leeward tests, as presented in the tables in Fig. 10 .

The tracer transportation characteristics in the street canyon had large differences from the conditions of an isolated building [4, 23, 24] or building arrays [25, 26] .

U represents the average result of the incoming wind velocity in the perpendicular direction to the street canyon (240 \ufffd ), and U SD represents the standard deviation of U. Tests 1 and 2 were conducted on June 8, 2019, and test 3 was conducted on June 9, 2019. It was observed that during test 2, the wind velocity was significantly lower, and the incoming wind deviated from the normal direction by 43:3 \ufffd . This value was larger than that observed in tests 1 and 3. Fig. 14 presents the average ventilation rates of source room BL2 and reentry ratios of BL3 and BL4 observed in the three tests with variation in U. When the value of U increased from 1:05 m=s to 2:50 m=s, the Y. Dai et al. ventilation rate of source room BL2 doubled. However, the ventilation rate no longer increased when U was 2:95 m=s. The value of the ventilation rate observed in test 3 was slightly lower than that observed in test 2.

Without a mechanical driving force and owing to its dispersal by pure wind, the uniformity of the tracer gas concentration in each room was difficult to ensure. The ACH and reentry ratio equations (3) and (4) were calculated based on well-mixed indoor tracer gas, which may lead to inaccuracies in the ventilation and reentry-ratio results.",

The ventilation distribution of the leeward-side room was more stable than that of the windward side. (2) The interunit dispersion between rooms in the source building changed significantly with the source room location. Owing to a large and stable vortex constructed by the freestream inside the street canyon, the tracer gas was mainly transported in the vortex direction, and the highest R k value occurred generally in the room nearest to the source room along the transportation route. (3) The general interunit dispersion between rooms in separate buildings was much smaller than that in the source building. However, owing to highly fluctuating wind conditions, rooms located in separate buildings may occasionally have larger reentry ratios than rooms located in the source building.",

Fig. 9 shows the U component by the wind mast in the middle of the street canyon during the test periods on June 9. Noted that the data of 2:4 m after 14 : 33 : 30 are missing because of an equipment malfunction. Several observations can be made from the wind profile. First, two opposite airflow directions existed in the middle of the street canyon. The wind flow at heights of 0:75 m and 1:05 m followed the incoming wind direction for most of the measuring time except at a few points, while the wind flow at heights of 0:15 m and 0:45 m was in the reverse direction. This reveals a counterclockwise-rotating vortex in the street canyon produced by the freestream flow. This result is consistent with the airflow field in the 1 : 1 street canyon from previous research",
