There is ample documentation 1 for the confounding effects of such transmission on research of viral infections in experimental animals (often in the absence of clinical disease). Of even greater concern, outbreaks of infection among laboratory workers by zoonotic agents such as lymphotrophic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) 2 and hantavirus 3 are traceable to contaminated biological materials transplanted into animals. The biosecurity tenets of many research organizations require screening for viral agents of all cell lines, tumors, sera, and other biologicals before implantation or inoculation into animal models. Federal guidelines 4,5 also dictate that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and other biotechnology products derived from tissues or cell lines of animal origin are demonstrated to be free of viral contamination before their use for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes.",

A recent development that is particularly useful for diagnostic applications is the fluorogenic 5\u2032-nuclease assay 23 , also known as TaqMan PCR, which makes use of an additional dye-labeled oligonucleotide probe that specifically hybridizes to the PCR product ( Fig. 1B) . As the amplification pro-gresses, the probe binds to the PCR product template and undergoes digestion by the polymerase enzyme, releasing a detectable fluorescent signal that may be read on a fluorometer after completion of the reaction or that can be monitored 'real-time' during the course of the reaction by a specialized thermocycler, permitting quantification of starting templates. Product detection by fluorescence permits a very high level of sensitivity, greatly simplifies post-PCR analysis, and lends itself to a 96-well plate format, allowing the use of semiautomated and automated procedures as throughput needs require.",

By comparison, PCR allows the processing of test articles and analysis of results in a period as short as one to two days, although the number of samples being analyzed and resources available may increase turnaround time.

Agents with divergent sequences between strains or subspecies may require multiple (or degenerate) PCR primers or probes 31 within a reaction mixture, or may require additional assays.
