            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes considerable damage in the poultry industry by infections of the respiratory tract and the reproductive organs 1. IBV is the prototype strain of the Coronaviridae, a family of positive stranded RNA viruses with a genome of about 28kb. This genome contains the information for three structural proteins and a number of enzymes involved in virus replication (Figure 2 ). Although vaccines offer protection, they are often made ineffective by the continuous emergence of new serotypes 2\"3. Serotypespecific protective immunity is thought to be mediated by antibodies to a protein on the surface of the virion, the so-called peplomer protein *--7. The peplomer protein is synthesized as a precursor glycoprotein, which is cleaved into the subunits S1 and $2, derived from its N-and C-terminal half, respectively a-~\u00b0. Point mutations are obviously involved in the generation of new serotypes. However, previous studies 1~ suggested that RNA recombination is also involved in the generation of new antigenic variants. To address the question of the frequency of recombination in the generation of new field isolates the nucleotide sequences in five windows of homologous sequences of the genomes of eight IBV strains have been compared. To make this comparison the sequences of the $2 genes of D207 and D1466 were newly determined. Both strains are Dutch field isolates and are included in vaccines currently used in The Netherlands. The alignment of the sequences suggests that the Dutch field strain D20712, the British field strain 6/8213 and the Japanese field strain KB8523 t4 result from RNA recombination events.",

            "text": "The nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared for possible recombination points. From this comparison we conclude that the Japanese field strain KB8523 is probably a recombinant. The $2 protein of this strain is almost identical to $2 of M41, except for the region corresponding to amino acids 929 to 1102 ( Figure I) where the sequence is remarkably similar to D1466. This suggests a recombination event with two crossovers in this region. The alignment of the $2 genes indicates a second potential recombinant: the British field isolate 6/82. Its S1 gene and most of the $2 gene are almost identical to those of strain D207. At the 3' end of the $2 sequence (at the Lys-1105 codon) the percentage of identical nucleotides switches from 99% upstream to 57% downstream. At exactly the same position the nucleotide sequence of 6/82 becomes highly similar to the D1466 sequence: from 73% identity upstream to 97% downstream. The nucleotide identity between D207 and Figure 1 D1466 is about the same on both sides of this putative crossover site: 73 and 67%, respectively. The above comparisons are both time consuming and subjective. A method was sought to test and quantify these results more rigorously. This was achieved by comparing phylogenetic trees for each of five sections (windows) of the $2 gene and its flanking sequences (see Figure 2a ). The $2 gene was divided into three sections.",

A clear advantage of this method is that, due to its simplicity, large numbers of homologous genes can easily be screened. The data presented in this paper suggest that genomic recombination not only occurs under laboratory conditions but also plays an important role in the generation of new virulent strains; at least three IBV strains, all isolated from outbreaks, are potential recombinants. Pre,)ious data ~1 already indicated that the Dutch field isolate V1397 is also the product of a recombination. Considering the limited number of sequences analysed so far, in vivo recombination of IBV seems to occur at a rather high frequency. This has implications for the use of IBV vaccines consisting of several serotypes of live attenuated IBV strains. These vaccines offer the best protection, but they may prove dangerous in the long term by the induction of new variants, not only by point mutations but also through recombination. In this respect vaccination protocols that combine IBV with other live attenuated viruses are equally suspect. They may create ideal conditions for non-homologous recombination which may result in the emergence of recombinant virus species with unwanted properties.",
