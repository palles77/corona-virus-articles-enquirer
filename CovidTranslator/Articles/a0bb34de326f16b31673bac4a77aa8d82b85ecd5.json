The results show that Hong Kong's total factor productivity has fallen in the 1990s. The competitiveness of the three sectors of tradable goods, tradable services and non-tradable services has increased, remained unchanged and declined, respectively in the last two decades. Policy recommendation for Hong Kong will be to aim for a supply-drive strategy so as to broaden the economic base. #",

Over the years, Hong Kong had acted as a ''shelter'' receiving a large number of natives fleeing from Mainland China in pursuit of political stability and economic opportunities. Hong Kong's economic openness and desire to attain economic security enabled Hong Kong to supply goods and services to the rest of the world. The rise in income and demand was the result of the successful outcome of the supply-driven economic strategy.",

            "text": "On July 1, 1997, Hong Kong became the Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China. The Central People's Government in Beijing adopted the ''one country, two systems'' approach in the post-1997 Hong Kong. Since 1985, Hong Kong experienced economic revival and wealth appreciation, but the rapid growth was soon fuelled with speculation in stocks and properties in the early 1990s, resulting in the economic bubble that eventually burst after the outbreak of the Asian Financial Crisis (AFC) in 1997-1998. The economic problem facing the post-AFC Hong Kong economy was structural imbalances with unemployment rate exceeding 7% in 2002. Such short-term fiscal incentives as the creation of temporary employments and assistance to small-and medium-sized industries have been introduced. After the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the spring of 2003, additional demand-driven solutions aimed to revive the Hong Kong economy, including the entry of visa-free Mainland travelers and the conclusion of two Closer Economic Partnership Agreements in 2003 and 2004 that permitted tariff-free exports of goods and services to Mainland were introduced. Economic optimism resulting from demand-driven policies has picked up and it is expected that when the new Disney Theme park opens in September 2005, the Hong Kong economy would have recovered considerably. Table 1 shows that Hong Kong's macro-economy generally performed better in 1980s than in 1990s, and the first half of 1990s was better than the second half of 1990s. Strong reexports growth lasted till the first half of the 1990s, and export of services maintained high. Growth in domestic investment remained robust in the 1986-1995 decade. The average real GDP growth maintained at 6.56% in the 1980s and 5.1% in the 1990s. Beginning from the early 1990s, despite the large total export to GDP ratio, domestic export could not keep pace with its growth rate.",

On the contrary, structural or supply-driven advocates (Dodsworth & Mihaljek, 1997) noted the structural imbalance and believed that Hong Kong's economic advantage can further be eroded as economic situation in Southern China strengthened. This paper expanded the data used in Imai (2001) and followed the classification of economic sectors used in Wong and Tao (2000) , and extended the empirical analysis by comparing total factor productivity (TFP) with unlit labor cost analysis. The empirical analysis show strongly that structural rigidity rests largely on the non-tradable service sector. For Hong Kong to achieve economic revival, economic recovery is the first step, but resources reallocations to the more competitive tradable industry and service sectors will strengthen Hong Kong's advantage and expand Hong Kong's economic base and capacity. The results clearly show the vulnerability and insufficiency of the demand-drive school, and demonstrate that it would be the successful application of supply-driven policies that could lead the Hong Kong economy to a new stage of achievement.",

The linked exchange rate system can automatically adjust the Hong Kong dollar prices of tradable goods and services. Thus, Hong Kong's tradable sectors remained price competitive despite wage increases. The rise in price of non-tradable sector is simply the result of expansion in the tradable sector, and a strong domestic demand is reflected in the increase in the value-added content of the non-tradable sector. Thirdly, Hong Kong's advantage lies in its ability to provide business clusters that keep Hong Kong competitive despite the low production cost in Southern China. Cost of production becomes secondary if business opportunities are good and profits are made. The international, open and free nature of Hong Kong is itself a powerful competitive edge that few economies in the neighboring economies possess.",

By the mid-1990s, the Hong Kong economy was speculation-led, characterized by a falling level of domestic exports and rising cost. Statistics on wage increase showed that in the period 1981-1997, tradable goods have twice experienced a two-digit wage increase in both current and constant price terms, while such non-tradable services as electricity and gas, transportation, and storage and communication, have experienced a total of four or five occasions of two-digit wage increase in both current and constant price terms (Li, 2001) . Hong Kong's economic structural rigidity is the result of two separate economic trends (Li, 2002) . On the one hand, sharp expansion in speculative activities boosted the nominal economy that merely involved monetary transactions. On the other hand, industrial hollowing and the fall in domestic exports resulted in the shrinkage of real economic activities that involved a reduction in employment, industrial output and exports. When the economic bubble burst, the structural imbalance was exposed when the shrinking real economy could not support the collapse of the nominal economy.",

The demand-driven advocates (Wong & Tao, 2000 , Appendix A) emphasized the rapid expansion of producer service industries, but noted the difficulty in deciding on the choice of producer services. Both the definition and the estimation of the proportion of producer services are subject to debate. Producer service is defined by subtracting the nominal values of consumer services and government services from the nominal value-added of total services. The percentage calculations are based on rough estimations, but are highly questionable (as reproduced in Appendix Table A .3). For example, all hotel services are regarded as producer services, but hotels accommodation is demanded by tours to Hong Kong that are consumer related. In the case of storage facilities, an assumption of 45% consumed as producer service suggested that the rest of 55% would be used for consumption purpose by private individual households.",

Labor productivity in the tradable goods sector, which is shown in Fig. 1 , has been rising since 1985, while unit labor cost maintained a stable trend until the late 1990s. As Hong Kong's manufacturing industries have migrated to Southern China beginning from the mid-1980s, demand for industrial workers in Hong Kong has fallen, and only those efficient and productive workers can remain in the industry. The stable unit cost trend shows that the increase in output came mainly from productivity. Thus, the improvement in labor productivity has maintained Hong Kong's competitiveness in the manufacturing sector. Fig. 2 gives a mixed picture for the tradable services sector. Labor productivity has shown an overall rising trend, but unit labor cost has also caught up significantly and remained high until the late 1990s. Tradable services probably faced a competitive world price, and the economic overheating in the first half of the 1990s has pushed up the unit labor cost. The fall in demand and price in tradable services after the AFC, however, could have led to a considerable fall in unit labor cost. The picture shown in Fig. 3 on the non-tradable services sector suggests that while the labor productivity trend in the entire period showed only a One possible explanation on the high unit labor cost and low labor productivity in the non-tradable services sector could be their monopolistic position that shielded them from international price competition.

The large increase in construction pushed up this percentage. By contrast, the average of the nine industries with decreases in unit labor cost is \u00c02.27%. The large percentage change can be due to the initial low wage paid to workers. In construction where sub-contracting is common, for example, a considerable amount of the cost would have taken up by the middlemen, while the actual wage paid to the construction workers is low.

Hong Kong has experienced an undisturbed period of robust economic growth until the outbreak of the AFC in 1997/ 1998. The estimates on the labor productivity of twenty individual industries show that the non-tradable services have performed poorly, and their unit labor cost has expanded. One can conclude that the solution to Hong Kong's economic problem rests on the unit labor cost and the uncompetitive nature of many non-tradable services. In the case of manufacturing industries, the high productivity suggested that new investments in Hong Kong's manufacturing sector could take place, though Hong Kong will not only confine to labor-intensive industries anymore. Given the increasing role of the service economy, the expansion of the tradable services, including the tradable producer services, will be most suitable for Hong Kong, as it development can raise domestic demand and employment in line with international competitiveness.",

The debate between demand-driven and supply-driven policies can complement each other. A flexible economic structure facilitates the function of the free market. The flexible economic structure means that Hong Kong should pursue supply-side strategies, as the availability of additional resources can attract further demand. In policy terms, this requires the continued investment in infrastructure, investment in human capital and the provision of more resources, typically land resources that can promote the economic capacity of Hong Kong. A long-term strategy that projects a multi-dimension economy is more suitable than to use short-term policies to reduce temporary economic ills, and repetition in the use of short-term policies could deprive the benefits of a long-term policy. Hong Kong cannot be a national economy, but a diversified economic base permits productivity to improve both extensively and intensively.",

Each economic sector's value-added is given by the compensation of employees and gross operating surplus. The former is mainly wage payment to workers, while the latter is the return to employers and entrepreneurs including self-employed workers. In order not to understate the share to labor factor payment, the compensation of the self-employed should be included in the compensation of employees. This is done by calculating the adjusted compensation of employees, which includes the original level of compensation of employees and the portion of compensation derived from the self-employed. The statistics on the number of self-employed for the period 1985-2000 can be obtained from the Annual Digest of Statistics (Census and Statistics Department, various years), and the figures before 1985 were extrapolated. The analysis assumes that the compensation of the selfemployed is the same as the employed. The share of labor factor payment is calculated from the rate of adjusted compensation of employees to the production-based GDP in current price.",
