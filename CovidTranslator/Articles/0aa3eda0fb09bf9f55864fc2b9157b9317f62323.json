A descriptive exploratory study of two border epidemiological surveillance (BES) systems has been performed. Two approaches were used to collect data: i) technical visits to the facilities involved with border surveillance and application of a questionnaire survey; ii) application of an online questionnaire survey. It was identified that, for both surveillance systems, more than 55% of the technicians had realized that the BES and its activities have high priority. Eighty percent of North American and 71% of Brazilian border jurisdictions reported an exchange of information between countries. Less than half of the jurisdictions reported that the necessary tools to carry out information exchange were available. Operational attributes of completeness, feedback, reciprocity, and quality of information were identified as weak or of low quality in both systems. Statements, guidelines, and protocols to develop surveillance activities are available at the U.S.-Mexico border area. The continuous systematic development of surveillance systems at these borders will create more effective actions and responses.",

However, despite what has been developed so far, significant obstacles were identified, such as a lack of support from federal laboratories and no standardization of techniques among countries. This hindered comparisons and the planning of binational actions. A study about the occurrence of public health emergencies in Brazil proved that, in the border areas, laboratory confirmation remains low for suspected cases 21 . This lack of diagnosis can be attributed to the high testing demand that these laboratories have, which requires additional investment for its expansion and an increase of capacity to become a robust border network. Although one of the response pillars to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa has been the laboratory support, the lack of capacity during the early stages of the epidemic was undoubtedly a factor that contributed to Ebola's rapid expansion, reinforcing the idea of consolidating a prepared network to respond to any type of threat 32, 33 . Such difficulties in the BES development, including laboratory services, may have contributed to a weak capacity to detect and respond in a timely manner to public health events, as observed for the Brazilian international border municipalities 34 . The analysis of their capacity to report infectious diseases with a potential to generate an epidemic demonstrated a very low proportion (16,6%) of cases of these diseases being reported in a timely manner (< 24 hours -as established nationally).",

The Treaty of Asunci\u00f3n, which gave rise to MERCOSUR, establishes that the States' parties have the freedom of movement for people, goods, and services among them 35 . Hence, the Brazilian Southern Border Arc has an extremely high daily porosity for people entry and exit, once the crossing between countries can be taken without any impediment. As evidenced by the research, there are numerous points of entry, where there are no checkpoints, such as health inspection points or customs. On the other hand, in North America, in addition to the physical barriers along the border, all entry points are controlled by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). This agency first screens incoming international travelers with the CDC and has the power to detain for the enforcement of isolation and quarantine of individuals with any signs and/or symptoms of infectious diseases 36 . The presence of such agencies as the CBP plays an important role in the containment of infectious diseases entering the United States. Countries that applied travel restrictions on their borders during the epidemic of the influenza virus A (H1N1) observed that both the restriction and the isolation and quarantine of the cases played an important contribution in the delay of the virus in their countries 37, 38 .",

The receiving health facility of a suspected case must be prepared to provide the initial care to isolate the case when necessary or make the transport to the place of isolation. They must then communicate in a timely manner with the respective authorities in the neighboring country to begin the binational investigation. Moreover, all health facilities in the border region, including laboratories, must be notified about the possible suspect cases. An online system for binational notification would be the tool of choice. All levels involved in the response could then input, search, and follow up in real time on all the epidemiological information of cases, thus creating increased transparency and dynamism to the response process. Inside this network, an important movement should be made to bring international organizations closer, such as PAHO and multilateral mechanisms, as MERCOSUR and UNASUR. These structures and mechanisms should have important tools that have been created for international health dialogue so they can act as front ambassadors to stalemates when an urgent international response is required. Forums and mechanisms created by these agencies are important health authorities of the participating countries. Due to the previous meetings, they already have affinities, which facilitate and streamline the dialogue and target the most controversial issues.",

Specifically, in the South Arc, obtaining responses from Paraguayan technicians would have enhanced and contributed much to the technical discussion. However, despite numerous contacts and invitations, this did not materialize. This limitation has highlighted the lack of multinational mechanisms that could facilitate and would promote dialogue with BES structures.",
