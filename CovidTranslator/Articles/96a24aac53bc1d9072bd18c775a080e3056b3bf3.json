Here, we describe the heterologous expression of pAPN without signal peptide in BL21(DE3)pLysS host cells. The Escherichia coli (E. coli) harboring the recombinant construct was efficiently induced to express the pAPN protein at a high level. The most optimal expression profile for pAPN expression was investigated. By inoculating a rabbit with the purified pAPN, a high tittered specific antibody was achieved. Biologically, the antibody reacted with either pAPN-expressing E. coli or native pAPN on the surface of swine testis cells. The pAPN and its specific antibody blocked transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus infection in vitro. Furthermore, the localization of pAPN on the small intestine of swine was analyzed by immunohistochemistry.",

The pAPN is highly expressed in small intestinal mucosa, where aminopeptidase represents about 8% of the protein content of the apical membrane of the differentiated enterocytes and catalyzes the removal of single amino acids from the amino terminus of peptides for the final steps of digestion (Delmas et al., 1992) . Although APN as receptors for many coronaviruses are species-specific (Delmas et al., 1994; Kolb et al., 1996) , the feline APN can also serve as a receptor for canine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis and human coronavirus 229E in addition to feline infectious peritonitis virus (Tresnan et al., 1996) .",

Therefore, we wanted to express the pAPN in such system for the first time. In designing strategies for the expression of the protein, we used BL21 (DE3) pLysS as host cells for expression based on the following reasons. Firstly, BL21 strains are the most widely used hosts for protein expression and have the advantage of being deficient in both lon and ompT proteases. The DE3 indicates that the host is a lysogen of DE3, and therefore carries a chromosomal copy of the T7 RNA polymerase gene under control of the lacUV5 promoter. Such strains are suitable for production of protein by induction with IPTG. The types of pLysS strains express T7 lysozyme, which further suppresses basal expression of T7 RNA polymerase prior to induction, thus stabilizing recombinants encoding target proteins that affect cell growth and viability. This BL21 system is rather matured and therefore is extensively used (Stabile et al., 2000; Rina et al., 2000; B\u00f6ck et al., 2007; Volont\u00e8 et al., 2008) . At the same time, the pGEX-6P-1 is a good prokaryotic expression vector with a tac promoter for chemically inducible, high-level expression as well as an internal lac I q gene for use in any E. coli host. Several foreign proteins have been successfully using pGEX vector (Mikami et al., 2006; Capparelli et al., 2007; Chuan et al., 2008) .",

The highest yield of pAPN in the E. coli was achieved in SOC media at 37 \u2022 C using 1 mM IPTG as inducer. In addition to IPTG concentration and induction time, the media also was a vital condition for pAPN expression. The SOC media was superior to LB media in terms of the ability of inducing protein expression, and we putatively believe that the high nutrition components of media should be one of the crucial factors for a maximal production of foreign protein in prokaryotic system.

Because the GST tag cannot influence the application of pAPN protein, therefore, we used a very simple gel-cutting method instead of using Factor Xa to cleave the GST tag to purify the fusion protein. The former method is very cheap and effective. Subsequent biological experiments indicated that the purified pAPN was a good immunogen for eliciting highly titered and specific polyclonal antibodies in the inoculated rabbit. The pAPN could be recognized not only by the corresponding polyclonal antibody, but also by anti-GST-tag monoclonal antibody in a Western blot analysis (data not shown). Interestingly, in our immunofluorescence assay, we also found that the protein was detected on the surface of the bacteria harboring the recombinant plasmid. We speculate that the transport of pAPN to the cell surface may be due to either the overexpression of the protein or some unidentified secreting signals, which needs to be investigated in the future. The specific antibody induced by the pAPN also reacted with the natural pAPN on the surface of ST cells, the swine testis cells by indirect immunofluorescence assay, demonstrating that the antibody recognize aminopeptidase N in a species-specific way. However, the pre-incubation of anti-pAPN sera with the ST cells blocked the cell infection by TGEV efficiently, confirming the utility and specificity of the pAPN and its antibody. The expression of pAPN on the brush border of small intestine was detected using the specific antibody, which is consistent with clinical infection sites of TGEV in vivo. The antibody is also a good diagnosis reagent for localizing pAPN in other tissues.",
