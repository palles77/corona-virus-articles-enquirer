It can be expected that the SARS-CoV susceptible cells express a SARS-CoV specific receptor. We could identify mRNA of ACE2 in SARS-CoV susceptible Vero E6, Huh-7, porcine POEK and PS cells but ACE2 protein expression could not be verified by several methods suggesting that the expression level may be very low. Recent studies have revealed that recombinant ACE2 expressed on the cell surface does trigger viral permissiveness and that infection can be blocked by soluble ACE2 [6, 10] . The different infection rates in porcine POEK and PS cells may be due to a lower expression rate of the ACE2 which we showed on mRNA level. Moreover there could be the necessity of an accessory factor for virus adsorption and entry. This could be confirmed by Chan et al. [1] who found ACE2 expression also in cells that were not susceptible for SARS-CoV.",

Interestingly, infection efficiency in POEK cells could be increased quickly by adaptation of the virus to POEK cells. Present studies will therefore clarify the question to what extent the adapted viruses differ from the original virus stock by growth comparisons and sequencing.",

Before adding the enzymes the reaction mixture was heated to 65 \u2022 C for 5 min and placed on ice for 1 min. The program for the reverse transcription was 42 \u2022 C for 50 min and 70 \u2022 C for 15 min.To check if the transcription has been successful and the transcribed RNA has been free of PCR inhibitors all human and simian cDNA samples were tested in a control PCR using primers detecting the glycerylaldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene[12]. Amplification was performed in a 25 \u00b5l reaction volume using 1 \u00b5l of cDNA, 2.5 \u00b5l 10 * buffer, 5 nmol dNTPs, 75 nmol MgCl 2 , and 1 U Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) (94 \u2022 C, 2 min; 35 * [94 \u2022 C, 30 sec; 59 \u2022 C, 30 sec; 72 \u2022 C, 1 min] 72 \u2022 C, 3 min).",
