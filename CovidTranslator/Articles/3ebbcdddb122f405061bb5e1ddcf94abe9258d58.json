Due to international travel and human-to-human transmission, the virus spread rapidly inside and outside of China. Currently, there is no effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19, therefore research efforts are focused on the rapid development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. The SARS-CoV-2 M pro protease constitutes one of the most attractive antiviral drug targets. To address this emerging problem, we have synthesized a combinatorial library of fluorogenic substrates with glutamine in the P1 position. We used it to determine the substrate preferences of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteases, using natural and a large panel of unnatural amino acids. The results of our work provide a structural framework for the design of inhibitors as antiviral agents or diagnostic tests.",

The inhibition of M pro would prevent the virus from replication and therefore constitutes one of the potential anti-coronaviral strategies. [6] [7] Due to the close phylogenetic relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, [2, 8] their main proteases share many structural and functional features. From the perspective of the design and synthesis of new M pro inhibitors, a key feature of both of the enzymes is their ability to cleave the peptide bond following Gln. The SARS-CoV M pro cleaves polyproteins within the Leu-Gln\u2193(Ser, Ala, Gly) sequence (\u2193 indicates the cleavage site), which appears to be a conserved pattern of this protease. [6a, 7, 9] The ability of peptide bond hydrolysis after Gln residues is also observed for main proteases of other coronaviruses [10] but is unknown for human enzymes. This observation, along with further studies on the M pro , can potentially lead to new broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral inhibitors with minimum side effects. [11] In the present study, we applied the HyCoSuL (Hybrid Combinatorial Substrate Library) approach to determine the full substrate specificity profile of SARS-CoV M pro and SARS-CoV-2 M pro proteases. The use of natural and a large number of unnatural amino acids with diverse chemical structures allowed an in-depth characterization of the residue preference of the binding pockets within the active sites of the proteases. The results from library screening enabled us to design and synthesize ACC-labeled substrates with improved catalytic efficiency in comparison to a substrate containing only natural amino acids.",

Then, we measured the rate of substrate hydrolysis relevant to each protease (Figure 3) . The data clearly demonstrate that SARS-CoV M pro and SARS-CoV-2 M pro exhibit the same activity toward tested substrates. The results are consistent with the HyCoSuL screening data. The most preferred substrate, Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-ACC, is composed of the best amino acids in each position. Kinetic parameters were determined for the two best substrates (Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-ACC, Ac-Thz-Tle-Leu-Gln-ACC) and one containing the best recognized natural amino acids (Ac-Val-Lys-Leu-Gln-ACC) ( Table 1 ) toward SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Due to substrates precipitation due to high concentration needed in the assay, kinetic parameters toward SARS-CoV M pro could not be determined. Analysis of kinetic parameters revealed that these three substrates differ in the k cat value, while K M values are comparable.

In summary, we established substrate specificity profiles at the P4-P2 positions of the SARS-CoV M pro and SARS-CoV-2 M pro proteases using a combinatorial approach.

Fmoc-group deprotection was performed using 20% piperidine in DMF (three cycles: 5, 5, and 25 min), filtered and washed with DMF each time (six times). Next, 2.5 eq of Fmoc-ACC-OH (24.05 mmol, 10.64 g) was preactivated with 2.5 eq HOBt monohydrate (24.05 mmol, 3.61 g) and 2.5 eq DICI (24.05 mmol, 3.75 mL) in DMF and the slurry was added to the resin. The reaction was shaked gently for 24 hours at room temperature. After this time, the resin was washed four times with DMF and the reaction was repeated using 1.5 eq of above reagents in order to improve the yield of ACC coupling to the resin. After 24 hours, the resin was washed with DMF and the Fmoc protecting group was removed using 20% piperidine in DMF (5, 5, and 25 min), filtered and washed with DMF (six times).",

In separate Eppendorf tubes, 2.5 eq (0.15 mmol) Fmoc-P2-OH was preactivated with 2.5 eq HOBt (0.15 mmol, 22.5 mg) and 2.5 eq DICI (0.15 mmol, 23.55 \u03bcL) in DMF. Next, preactivated amino acids were added to wells of the apparatus containing H 2 N-Gln(Trt)-ACCresin, followed by 3 h of agitation at room temperature. Then, the reaction mixture was filtered, washed with DMF (4 times), and the ninhydrin test was carried out in order to confirm P2-amino acid coupling. Subsequently, Fmoc protecting groups were removed with the use of 20% piperidine in DMF (5, 5, and 25 min). For P3 and P4 position coupling, an isokinetic mixture for 48 portions was prepared from 18 Fmoc-protected natural amino acids (omitting cysteine; plus norleucine mimicking methionine; 19 amino acids in total). Next, 5 eq of isokinetic mixture, 5 eq HOBt (14.16 mmol, 2.13 g), and 5 eq DICI (14.16 mmol, 2.22 mL) were diluted in DMF and preactivated for 3 min. The activated isokinetic mixture was added to each of 48 wells containing 1 eq of H 2 N-P2-Gln(Trt)-ACC-resin. After 3 h of gentle agitation, the slurry was filtered off and washed with DMF (4 times). A ninhydrin test was carried out and the Fmoc protecting group was removed using 20% piperidine in DMF (5, 5, and 25 min). The same procedure was applied for the remaining compounds. The isokinetic mixture was added to prepare the P4 position in the same manner as for the P3 position. In the last step of the synthesis, N-terminus acetylation was performed; to prepare the mixture for 48 compounds, 5 eq of AcOH (14.16 mmol, 807 \u00b5L), 5 eq HBTU (14.16 mmol, 5.37 g), and 5 eq DIPEA (14.16 mmol, 2.44 mL) in ~45 mL of DMF were added to a 50-mL falcon tube. After gentle stirring for 1 min, the mixture (~800 \u00b5L) was added to each well in the reaction apparatus, containing the H 2 N-Mix-Mix-P2-Gln(Trt)-ACC-resin, followed by gentle agitation for 30 min. Next, the resin was washed six times with DMF, three times with DCM, three times with MeOH, and dried over P 2 P4 sublibraries was performed in the same manner as described above; P3 and P4 sublibraries were synthesized by coupling fixed amino-acid residues to P3 (isokinetic mixture coupled to P2 and P4) and P4 position (isokinetic mixture coupled to P2 and P3).",

The library screen revealed that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 M pro display very similar substrate specificity, however SARS-CoV M pro possesses broader substrate preferences at the P2 position (Figure 2). The most preferred amino acid at the P2 position is leucine in case of both proteases. SARS-CoV M pro exhibits lower activity toward other tested amino acids at this position (<30%). The S2 pocket of SARS-CoV-2 M pro can accommodate other hydrophobic residues, such as 2-Abz (54%), Phe(4-NO 2 ) (50%), 3-Abz (50%), \u03b2 -Ala (49%), Dht (46%), hLeu (43%), Met (41%), and Ile (37%) (amino acid structures are presented in Table S1, SI). Both enzymes prefer hydrophobic D and L amino acids and also positively charged residues at the P3 position; the best are: Tle, D-Phe, D-Tyr, Orn, hArg, Dab, Dht, Lys, D-Phg, D-Trp, Arg, and Met(O) 2 . SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 M pro possess broad substrate specificity at the P4 positon. The most preferred are small aliphatic residues such as Abu, Val, Ala, and Tle, but other hydrophobic amino acids are also accepted. These findings can be partly explained by the available crystal structures of SARS-CoV M pro in complex with inhibitors. [6b, 9, 12] The hydrophobic S2 subsite of SARS-CoV M pro is larger compared to other M pro coronavirus",

The synthesis of P2, P3, and P4 sublibraries is exemplified in detail with the P2 sublibrary. The P2 library consisted of 137 compounds where all of the natural amino acids (omitting cysteine) and a pool of unnatural amino acids were used at a defined position (in this case, the P2 position) and an isokinetic mixture of 19 amino acids (without cysteine; plus norleucine mimicking methionine) was coupled in the remaining positions (in case of the P2 sublibrary, positions P3 and P4 were occupied by isokinetic mixture). Equivalent ratios of amino acids in the isokinetic mixture were defined based on their reported coupling rates. A fivefold excess (over the resin load) of the mixture was used. For fixed positions, 2.5 eq of single amino acid was used. All reactions were performed with the use of the coupling reagents DICI and HOBt. For P2 coupling, the synthesis of the library was performed using a",

After precipitation (30 min at -20\u00b0C), the mixture was centrifuged and washed again with Et 2 O (5 mL). After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and the remaining white precipitate was dissolved in ACN/H 2 O (v/v, 3/1) and lyophilized.
