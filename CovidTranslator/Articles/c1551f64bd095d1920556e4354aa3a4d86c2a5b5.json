            "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common complex multifactorial joint related autoimmune inflammatory disease with unknown etiology accomplished with increased cardiovascular risks. RA is characterized by the clinical findings of synovial inflammation, autoantibody production, and cartilage/bone destruction, cardiovascular, pulmonary and skeletal disorders. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were responsible for the induction of inflammation in RA patients. Drawbacks such as poor efficacy, higher doses, frequent administration, low responsiveness, and higher cost and serious side effects were associated with the conventional dosage forms for RA treatment. Nanomedicines were recently gaining more interest towards the treatment of RA, and researchers were also focusing towards the development of various anti-inflammatory drug loaded nanoformulations with an aid to both actively/passively targeting the inflamed site to afford an effective treatment regimen for RA. Alterations in the surface area and nanoscale size of the nanoformulations elicit beneficial physical and chemical properties for better pharmacological activities. These drug loaded nanoformulations may enhances the solubility of poorly water soluble drugs, improves the bioavailability, affords targetability and may improve the therapeutic activity. In this regimen, the present review focus towards the novel nanoparticulate formulations (nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanomicelles, and nanocapsules) utilized for the treatment of RA. The recent advancements such as siRNA, peptide and targeted based nanoparticulate systems for RA treatment were also discussed. Special emphasis was provided regarding the pathophysiology, prevalence and symptoms towards the development of RA.",

Various factors such as disease activity, socioeconomic, educational status, body mass index, spirituality, age and gender affects RA patient's quality of life [2] . RA varies significantly from osteoarthritis, which is a degenerative joint disease affects only joint function (Fig. 1 ). Gastrointestinal disturbance, renal malfunctioning and increased cardio vascular risk were also associated with RA [3] . Systemic manifestations such as subcutaneous nodules, pleuritis, pericarditis, and vasculitis, contribute to morbidity and mortality of RA development [4] . RA development seems to be stronger for men's associated with cigarette smoking than womens. The occurrence of RA is unidentified, but it is presumed that the environmental factors may contribute to its development in genetically susceptible individuals [5] . The genetic components and environmental factors influences that subsequent immune response and studies have reported that multiple cell types (including B cells, T cells, macrophages/synoviocytes) serves as key regulators for immunologic events in RA over the years [6] . The interactions between the environmental factors along with the genetics of patients were associated with RA development. The other important environmental risk factors for RA development were coffee/alcohol intake, oral contraceptive usage, birth weight irregularities and breast feeding [7] . The various symptoms associated with the RA development were shown in Fig. 2 .",

In case of bone manifestations, bones are affected both locally and systemically. Local, factors that stimulate osteoclasts results in increased bone resorption and these osteoclasts were released from inflammatory and fibroblastic pannus cells [12] . Mostly, RA patients were prone to bisphosphonate therapy for osteoporosis or prevention of glucocorticoid-mediated bone loss. Airway manifestations of RA include cricoarytenoid arthritis, pulmonary fibrosis and small airway disease, typically seen as bronchiolitis with obstructive abnormalities in lung functions. Lung disease is more predominant in RA patients especially in male seropositive smokers. RA patient's holds 40% increased risk of mortality which leads to an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease with elevated level of inflammatory markers [13] .",

Inspite, we are also developing a formulation using MTX with another drug combination for the effective treatment of RA. In addition glucocorticoid (GC) also widely used for the effective management of RA. GC can be used as monotherapy as Materials Today Communications 17 (2018) [200] [201] [202] [203] [204] [205] [206] [207] [208] [209] [210] [211] [212] [213] well as in combination with other agents. Long term administration of GCs may leads to anti-inflammatory remunerations and action against structural damage. The most widely utilized GCs were methylprednisolone, triamcinolone, prednisone, and hydrocortisone [16] . Glucocorticoidal injections, TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors, T-cell activation inhibitors, Bcell depletes, IL-6 inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, immunosuppressant's and steroids are also highly effective for the treatment of RA. The use of combination therapy for RA treatment were followed during past years (10 years), but now at least one third of patients with RA are treated by combination therapy in India. Traditional approach for the management of RA has also been changed from monotherapy to combination approach. The different treatment methods adopted for RA is shown in Fig. 4 .",

Recently many techniques were developed to study the physical phenomena and constructs (typically 1-100 nanometers) of different nanomaterials [36] . The term \"smart materials\" has been utilized to describe nanoparticles to focus delivery of drugs to particular organs of the body. This technology paved its way for the past several years towards the expansion in the potential uses of nanoparticles as cosmetic products. Liposomal technologies were utilized to adjust optical properties, in order to improve its solubility and to alter its physical properties, provided for hydrophilic vesicles with phosphatidylcholine membrane(s) [37] . Nanomaterials have been used in medicinal field for therapeutic drug delivery with the focus for treatments of various diseases/disorders.

They utilized an immunosuppressive tocilizumab as a monoclonal antibody, targeting the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor. Synthesis of gold nanoparticles was performed using citrate method. They attained a particle diameter of 64.83 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.18 for HA-AuNP/TCZ complex. They found that TCZ was steadily released from the HA-AuNP/ TCZ complex up to 80% for about 8 days after incubation in the bovine serum albumin. Further they observed anti-angiogenic effect of the developed HA-AuNP/TCZ complex upon proliferation of HUVEC cells by binding to VEGF receptor. At in-vivo level they found that treatment with HA-AuNP/TCZ complex in RA induced mice exhibits clear interface between cartilage and bone comparable to the normal group (without RA induced). Further their confirmation by western blot analysis showed significant upregulated expression levels of IL-6 and CD68, which indicates that the treatment with HA-AuNP/TCZ complex resulted in significantly reduced levels of IL-6 and CD68. Finally they conclude that, HA-AuNP/TCZ complex might be useful for the dual targeting drug candidate to VEGF and IL-6R receptors for the treatment of RA. Celecoxib loaded tristearin based lipidic nanoparticles (CEL-TS-LN) was synthesized by Kishore et al. [47] and they checked for its effective management in RA treatment by in-vitro/in-vivo studies. They utilized celecoxib as the selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, orally for the treatment of RA. They utilized statistical experimental design to optimize the nanoparticle using the independent variables (homogenization speed, quantity of tristearin and quantity of emulsifier) depend on desired particle size, loading efficiency and drug release. They observed a particle size of 188.6 nm with a PDI 0.26, obtaining a spherical morphology. XRD results indicated that the drug is dispersed at a molecular level in the lipid matrix and also rapid quenching of the micro emulsion prevents the drug to crystallize stage.",

They achieved size and charge for CHNPs, MTXCHNPs, DEXCHNPs about 299.4 nm (PDI 0.437), 217.4 nm (PDI 0.275), 329.8 nm (PDI 0.286) and +35.7 mV, +26.9 mV, +19.5 mV respectively. The FTIR results confirmed that phosphoric group of tripolyphosphate with amine groups of chitosan plays the major role for hydrogen bond in the formulation of MTXCHNP and DEXCHNP. They observed a controlled release patterns coupled with diffusion of drug in two different buffers at pH 7.4 and pH 5.8 respectively. They studied the cellular behaviour in HEK and murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cell lines. The IC 50 value for MTXCHNP in human Embryonic Kidney cells was 26.1 \u03bcg/mL and 7.7 \u03bcg/mL for RAW cell lines. The IC 50 value for MTXCHNP was 20.12 \u03bcg/mL in HEK cells and 7.37 \u03bcg/mL in RAW264.7 cells. Cellular uptake studies indicate the internalization of nanoparticles by phagocytosis process. The drug release gets enhanced at lower pH with increased cytotoxicity. Insignificant ex-vivo haemolysis indicated the higher biocompatibility of the nanoparticles. The synthesized CHNP exhibited maximum absorption in blood circulation within 3 h, followed by hepatic metabolism and renal clearance. Finally, they observed higher anti-arthritic activity with antioxidant potential for the developed nanoparticulate systems. Dewangan et al.

They varied the reynolds number of the inlet streams to optimize the nano particle size and average diameter and observed a size around 155-400 nm.

They utilized RGD peptide as targeting moiety for inflammation. Near-infrared irradiation, upon the development of nanoparticles generates heat due to gold half shells, and MTX gets rapidly released. Synovial inflammation at multiple joints may be targeted with a penetration depth of near infrared light using this therapy. Nanoparticle with smaller dosage (1/930 of MTX solution) treatment would contribute to collagen-induced arthritic mice. They emphasized that multifunctional nanoparticle were effective for maximizing the therapeutic efficacy and minimizing dosage-related side effects in the treatment of RA. Furthermore, they showed that the nanoparticle could be applied for DMARD for the treatment of RA and other diseases. Tacrolimus (TAC-HSA-NPs) loaded albumin nanoparticles was developed by Thao et al. [51] using nanoparticle albuminbound technology to improve targetability and anti-arthritic efficacy. They observed an average diameter and charge of 185 nm and +30.5 mV respectively with spherical morphology. The encapsulation efficacy of TAC, within the nanoparticles was 79% and the water solubility of the developed nanoparticles gets increased 46 times than that of free TAC. TAC gets steadily discharged from the developed NPs over 24 h, which provides enough time for targeting and treatment in inflamed arthritic site by intravenous injection. In-vitro studies reported the anti-proliferative activities of TAC HSA-NPs monitored upon activated T cells compared with non-activated T cells. TAC HSA-NPs displayed significant higher anti-arthritic potential than TAC formulations compared to intravenously administered TAC solution or oral TAC suspension, as reflected by the incidence of arthritis and clinical score (1.6 vs. 3.2 and 5.0, respectively). Hence they conclude that novel TAC HSA-NPs may be an efficient drug delivery system for enhanced solubility with increased accumulation of drugs at joints for RA treatment.",

In-vivo pharmacodynamic studies in complete freund's adjuvant induced arthritic rats showed significant reduction of TNF-\u03b1 in treated rat which might be the mechanism behind the DMARD action of P-SLNs. Raj et al. [67] developed aceclofenac loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (ACF-SLNs) by incorporating into hydrogels by ultrasonic emulsification method using glyceryl monostearate as lipid. They optimized on the basis of lipid and stirring speed and found the average particle size (189 nm), polydispersity index (0.162 nm) and zeta potential (-32.51 mV) respectively for optimized formulation. They observed an entrapment efficiency of about 85%. In-vivo studies, showed better inhibition of edema with the magnitude of 81% after 6 h, as compared to that of plain ACF hydrogel. Furthermore, optimum size of the SLNs and close contact with the stratum corneum improved the enhanced skin deposition of drug. Thereby they emphasized that ACF-SLNs could have beneficial effect for RA treatment.",

In this method A-SLNs were used to target spleen and to eliminate the adverse effects (nephrotoxicity) upon oral administration. Their optimized formulation showed an average size of 241 nm with a charge of -17.14 mV. They showed that entrapment efficiency and loading for A-SLNs were 50.87% and 8.48%, respectively. They achieved that, the plasma concentration of A-SLNs were 1.88 times better than that of the actarit in 50% propylene glycol solution. However, targeting efficiency of A-SLNs was enhanced from 6.31% to 16.29% in spleen while the renal distribution of drug gets significantly reduced as compared to that of the drug solution, after intravenous administration to mice. These results suggests that injectable A-SLNs acts as promising passive targeting therapeutic agents, with reduced doses, decreased dosing frequency and lowered toxicity for RA treatment.

            "text": "Nanomicelles are amphiphilic molecules or surfactant monomers that have a polar head and a lipophilic tail. The properties related with amphiphilic molecules in solution results in developmental structures termed as micelles. These micelles hold internally hydrophobic core and externally a hydrophilic surface [69] . Micelles are generally made up of 50-200 monomers. The parameter which affects the micelle formation was the size of the hydrophobic area of amphiphilic molecule, amphiphile concentration, temperature, and solvent [70] . Polymeric micelle holds the diameter of 10-100 nm. Micellar core serves as a compatible microenvironment with center point for joining water insoluble guest molecules. Hydrophobic molecules can be covalently 60/-Anti-inflammatory effect [59] coupled to the block copolymers or it can be physically incorporated into the hydrophobic micelle core. Solubilization process of nanomicelles leads to enhancement of their water solubility and bioavailability. Cyclosporine A loaded polysialic acid-polycaprolactone micelles (PSA-PCL-CyA-NMs) for the treatment of RA was developed using selfassembly process using grafting technology by Wilson et al. [71] . However, PSA-PCL-CyA-NMs possess a loading capacity and loading efficiency of 0.09% and 29.3% precisely. In-vitro cellular behaviour studies in SW982 (synovial fibroblast cell line) indicated that, CyA gets released from PSA-PCL micelle by subsequent uptake of synovial fibroblasts through a non-receptor mediated endocytosis and partitioning of CyA into phospholipid membrane. Crielaard et al. [72] developed dexamethasone-loaded polymeric micelles (DEX-PMs) for the treatment of RA. They observed an average diameter of 70 nm and PDI of 0.1. However, highly efficient encapsulation of the DEX derivatives (> 80%) was attained at a drug/polymer ratio of 10% (w/w) and they confirmed the effect of developed formulation in-vivo in adjuvant induced arthritis model. Finally, they suggests that treatment of DEX-PMs showed an immediate and prolonged anti-arthritic effect in animal model and emphasized that DEX-PMs were significantly more effective than free DEX in terms of inhibition of arthritis score (p < 0.05 on day 16 and 20; p < 0.001 on day 21 onwards) by minimizing the degree of ankle swelling. Zhang et al. [73] developed indomethacin loaded polymeric micelles (IND-NMs) by conjugating amphiphilic polyphosphazenes with poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) and ethyl 4-aminobenzoate as adjacent groups by thermal ring opening polymerization. In-vivo pharmacodynamic studies performed on both acute paw edema and adjuvant arthritis models indicated that a sustained therapeutic efficacy could be achieved through local or intra-articular injection of IND-NMs. Furthermore, they suggest that amphiphilic copolymers could be utilized as injectable drug carriers for hydrophobic drugs. Wang et al. [74] developed low-dose glucocorticoidal therapy by utilizing micelle loaded with dexamethasone (DEX). They synthesized the polymeric micelle using poly (ethylene glycol)-block-poly (\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL-PEG) by self-assembly process. DEX incorporated into the PCL-PEG micelles showed an encapsulation of 94.2% and critical micellar concentration of 7.2 \u03bcg/mL. Cellular behaviour in Raw 264.7 cells showed a viability of 90%, whereas the free drug showed a viability of 70%. These results confirmed the conjugation of PCL-NPC and PCL-PEG in NMR analysis. They found that, DEX-NMs may afford a targeted delivery to inflamed joints. These indicate the potential of DEX-NMs at lower dose for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Helmy et al. [75] developed larnoxicam loaded nanomicelles (LX-NMs) by direct equilibrium technique for RA treatment. The hydrodynamic diameter and poly dispersive index of LX-NMs were found to be 169.45 nm and 0.243 respectively. In-vivo study revealed that LX-NMs exhibits better inhibitory effect on carrageenan-induced edema than free LX. LX-NMs showed effects comparable to that of diclofenac. In study period after 14th day, there was significant reduction in edema percentage and increased weight growth. They emphasized that, LX-NMs can be considered for RA treatment and inflammatory disorders. The different nanomicellar based delivery system adopted using various drugs were showed in Table 5 .",

[86] synthesized indomethacin-loaded nanocapsules (Ind-NCs) and evaluated its acute and sub chronic edema in experimental rat models by comparing their results with free indomethacin by employing in-vivo models in carrageenan-induced acute oedema, subchronic oedema and CFA-induced arthritis. The developed Ind-NCs [75] were more potent in both sub-chronic and in CFA induced the arthritis model, when compared to pure indomethacin. However, in CFA arthritis model, treated with Ind-NCs markedly inhibited the serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor A and IL-6 (83% and 84% sequentially), while the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were significantly increased. This indicates that gastrointestinal damage in Ind-NCs treated animals were significantly lesser in comparison to Indomethacin treated groups and these results suggested that these formulation might represent a promising alternative for treating chronic inflammatory diseases, with decreased undesirable effects. Friedrich et al. [87] developed tacrolimus loaded lipidic core nanocapsules (TAC-LCNCs) to afford systemic anti-arthritic properties using self-assembly process and they showed unimodal particles size distribution with an average particle size of 212 nm (PDI < 0.12) at an encapsulation of 99%. In-vivo studies elicits that the animals treated with TAC-LCNCs showed significant inhibition of paw oedema after intraperitoneal administration. They suggested that these LCNCs have potential to prevent hyperglycemia mediated adverse effect of the drug and they conclude that TAC-LCNCs served as novel nanomedicine for the treatment of inflammatory disease. Boechat et al. [88] developed MTX-loaded lipidic core nanocapsules (MTX-LCNCs) and observed an averaged particle size and encapsulation efficiency of 172 nm and 20.0% respectively. They observed that MTX-LCNCs reduced both TNF-\u03b1 and serum levels. MTX-LCNCs showed its efficacy by decreasing the pro-inflammatory cytokines and T-cell-derived cytokines such as interferon-gamma and interleukin-17 A than MTX solution. Furthermore, they concluded that these formulations were more effective towards inflammation control at doses 75% lower than conventional MTX.",

The different approaches focussed towards the treatment of RA were shown below. 7.1. siRNA based nanoparticulate systems for the treatment of RA Cellular mechanism responsible for post-transcriptional gene silencing acting on messenger RNA (mRNA) is termed as RNA interference (RNAi). Silencing attained with small interference RNA (siRNA) is transient; hence novel strategies were developed and reported to achieve more permanent silencing. Vectors encoded strategy such as short hairpin RNA (shRNA) may be also used for long-term stable cell silencing approach. Due to the excellent gene silencing potential of RNAi, it has attracted broad attention in terms of high specificity, significant effect, minor side effects and ease of synthesis. siRNA has the capacity for silencing a specific gene of interest. The problem associated with naked siRNA upon systemic administration was degradation with nucleases which ultimately shortens the siRNA circulation time in the blood stream. Moreover, siRNA gets engulfed through receptor mediated endocytosis, thereby escapes from the endosomal compartment with decreased therapeutic efficacy of naked siRNA. However, these issues have been recently addressed through the development of nanotechnology based products. In order to afford a better protection the siRNA has been encapsulated in to positively charged particles which effectively protects from serum degradation and off-target immunological effects. Recently, siRNA based delivery systems were utilized for the treatment of RA, especially providing an efficient distribution into peripherally inflamed tissue.",

They used Signaling Chain HOmo OLigomerization (SCHOOL) approach and acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) fusion peptide sequence for targeting TCR. In addition TCR Core peptide has been shown for the treatment for human T cell-mediated dermatoses that can substitute for corticosteroids. Incorporation of the peptide into self-assembling lipopeptide nanoparticles that mimic native human high density lipoproteins essentially increases peptide dosage efficacy. They found that, peptide improves collagen-induced arthritis in DBA/1 J mice and ensures against bone and cartilage damage.",

They checked KAFAK-loaded poly (NIPAm-AMPS) activity in in-vitro in human macrophage model (THP1 human monocytes) and ex-vivo in bovine knee cartilage tissue poly (NIPAm-AMPS). Their results showed a dose-dependent suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines upon treatment with KAFAK-loaded poly (NIPAm-AMPS) nanoparticles. Further, they demonstrated selective targeting and therapeutic efficacy of KAFAK when released from both degradable and non-degradable poly (NIPAm-AMPS) nanoparticles in in-vitro and ex-vivo models. They emphasized that, poly (NIPAm-AMPS) nanoparticles loaded with KAFAK could be an effective tool for the treatment of osteoarthritis.",
