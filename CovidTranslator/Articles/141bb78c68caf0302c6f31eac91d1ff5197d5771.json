There is a need for a consistent, interpretable and precise way to transfer data while maintaining its fidelity. We introduce 'EpiJSON', a new, flexible, and standards-compliant format for the interchange of epidemiological data using JavaScript Object Notation. This format is designed to enable the widest range of epidemiological data to be unambiguously held and transferred between people, software and institutions. In this paper, we provide a full description of the format and a discussion of the design decisions made. We introduce a schema enabling automatic checks of the validity of data stored as EpiJSON, which can serve as a basis for the development of additional tools. In addition, we also present the R package 'repijson' which provides conversion tools between this format, line-list data and pre-existing analysis tools. An example is given to illustrate how EpiJSON can be used to store line list data. EpiJSON, designed around modern standards for interchange of information on the internet, is simple to implement, read and check. As such, it provides an ideal new standard for epidemiological, and other, data transfer to the fast-growing open-source platform for the analysis of disease outbreaks.",

            "text": "Infectious disease epidemiology relies on integrating increasingly diverse and complex data. This complexity comes not only from the types of data now collected (for example genetic sequence, image and digital sensor data are routinely generated during the course of a disease outbreak, together with more traditional epidemiological data) but also through multiple partners investigating different facets, from different specialities or covering different geographical areas. This has been seen in recent major epidemics including the 2009 influenza pandemic (Fraser et al., 2009) , Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome outbreaks or the West-African Ebola epidemic (WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014 , 2015 . In this context, the safe storage and swift exchange of epidemiological data between collaborators and institutions is key to the successful assessment of, and response to, infectious disease epidemics. Consequently, a great deal of effort has been recently devoted to standardising platforms for the analysis of epidemiological data with software tools being constructed to permit interoperability between separate methodological approaches (Jombart et al., 2014) . Similar efforts have also been made in the fields of epidemiological data-gathering and recording (Aanensen et al., 2009; ECDC, 2015) .",

The production of such a capability would vastly improve our ability to transfer information between systems and in doing so aid the interpretation of disease dynamics and ultimately protect a greater number of individuals. Yet epidemics data are still, usually, held as a potentially confusing mass of spread-sheets, databases, text and binary files. A universal format enabling the coherent storage and transfer of these data is lacking. As a consequence, misinterpretation of the data may happen during transfer and result in errors being introduced into subsequent analyses and reports. Unfortunately, the inherent complexity of epidemiological data magnifies the risks of such errors. Fig. 1 illustrates the major systems within an epidemiology work-flow where a standard for digital epidemiology data would be of assistance. A major difficulty associated with transferring epidemiological data lies in the degree of complexity that a dataset may display. The information that is recorded may vary markedly not only between outbreaks but also within a single outbreak. In addition, the epidemic context itself makes data collection a daunting task, leading to some inevitable disparities in the data recorded.",

This information is meta-data. At a second level, most datasets are divided into subunits (units-of-record) that hold other information. These subunits could be individuals, regions, countries or time periods. In a conventional spreadsheet these units-of-record are usually stored as rows. The information relating to these units-of-record makes up the third level and is usually stored as columns in a conventional spreadsheet. This information can either relate directly to the unit-of-record itself (such as gender for an individual) or can relate to an event happening to or at that unit-of-record (such as the onset of symptoms for an individual).",

            "text": "The EpiJSON format capitalises on the common structure of most epidemiological datasets outlined above. Fundamentally, the structure of an EpiJSON file consists of three levels that we term \"metadata\", \"records\" and \"events\" (Fig. 2) . Within each of these three levels, data are stored in collections of objects called \"attributes\" which are the core of data storage in EpiJSON. An \"attribute\" object is used for storing unambiguously a discrete piece of information, recording not only the value of the data but also its name, type and units. The \"name\" is a label defining what the attribute is (e.g. \"age\" or \"gender\"), \"type\" defines the type of data being stored (e.g. \"number\" or \"string\"), \"value\" is the actual data value (e.g. 42 or \"male\"), and the optional \"units\" key specifies measurement units (e.g. \"years\"). As this data representation is very generic, it is used as a unit of data storage across the whole structure of EpiJSON. For example: an \"attribute\"\" object could be used to store the name of an infection within \"metadata\", the gender of an individual within a \"record\", and the infection status of an individual at a test within an \"event\". The difference between an \"event\" and an \"attribute\" is that an \"event\" occurs at a defined time or place and can therefore store dates and locations using standard formats. The advantage of the EpiJSON file structure is to clarify which data refer to the dataset, to records or to events associated with records. In contrast, conventional line list and other spreadsheet data can cause confusion as columns are often used to store all levels of data.",

The value of the \"id\" key, as for the record object, should be a string consisting of a version 4 UUID conforming to and generated as specified in RFC 4122 (Leach et al., 2005) . \"Name\" is a string that names the event. The value of \"name\" need not be unique, indeed it is suggested that a standard set of names are used to identify events across the dataset (and across multiple datasets). The \"date\" key records the time at which an event took place; it should be a valid string representation of a RFC3339 (Newman and Klyne, 2002) conformant date, this is a subset of the ISO 8601 extended format. If a single date point is insufficient to record an event, for instance to record a period of exposure, then we suggest that multiple events are recorded; in this example, one event object is coded to record the start of exposure and one to record the end. The \"location\" key stores a geospatial object in GeoJSON format (Butler et al., 2008) representing the location of an event. By allowing different events to have different geospatial types it is possible to choose the most appropriate geospatial object for an event without being restricted by the choice within other events (i.e. it would be valid to record the only vaguely known location of infection as a large polygon, while simultaneously having a point to represent where an individual was admitted to hospital). This scheme also permits the use of different projections for different events (e.g. a national/local grid for some while using WGS 84, the GPS coordinate system, for others). The \"attributes\" key holds an array of attributes defined in the same way as above.

As with encryption, it is not within the scope of a format for epidemiological data to specify a data compression standard but note that, as a structured text document with a good deal of repetition, EpiJSON files compress well using commonly available compression tools. EpiJSON's requirement for additional space is not considered an impairment to its applicability.",

            "text": "Finally, the EpiJSON format is deliberately broad to permit the capture of the widest range of epidemiological datasets. However, we recognise that there are sub-types of epidemiological data. It is envisaged that standard attribute sets will be agreed to address specific types of epidemiological data, much as conventions have emerged for NetCDF datasets (Unidata, 2015b) e.g. the CF convention for climatology (Eaton et al., 2011) . The adoption of well-defined data standards makes both the contribution of data to communal efforts and the development of data tools much easier. This has been the case for public transport data (Google, 2015) , where a standard allows companies to submit their timetables in a form that can be used by Google Maps to provide route information. This definition of an open data structure for epidemiology is the first step in allowing other developers and collaborators to modify their software and work-flows to utilise the standard. The development of useful tools and practices will, by necessity, be an iterative process with input from a wide range of users.",
