            "text": "We conducted a comparative study of COVID-19 epidemic in three different settings: mainland China, the Guangdong province of China and South Korea, by formulating two disease transmission dynamics models incorporating epidemic characteristics and setting-specific interventions, and fitting the models to multi-source data to identify initial and effective reproduction numbers and evaluate effectiveness of interventions. We estimated the initial basic reproduction number for South Korea, the Guangdong province and mainland China as 2.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): (2.5, 2.7)), 3.0 (95%CI: (2.6, 3.3)) and 3.8 (95%CI: (3.5,4.2)), respectively, given a serial interval with mean of 5 days with standard deviation of 3 days. We found that the effective reproduction number for the Guangdong province and mainland China has fallen below the threshold 1 since February 8 th and 18 th respectively, while the effective reproduction number for South Korea remains high, suggesting that the interventions implemented need to be enhanced in order to halt further infections. We also project the epidemic trend in South Korea under different scenarios where a portion or the entirety of the integrated package of interventions in China is used. We show that a coherent and integrated approach with stringent public health interventions is the key to the success of containing the epidemic in China and specially its provinces outside its epicenter, and we show that this approach can also be effective to mitigate the burden of the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea. The experience of outbreak control in mainland China should be a guiding reference for the rest of the world including South Korea.",

These interventions can be basically classified into two major categories: the measures of the first category are aimed at protecting the borders and include interventions like travel restrictions and border entry screening, whereas the measures of the second category have the objective of locally controlling the spreading of the virus and include enhanced epidemiological surveys and surveillance, contact tracing, school closure and other interventions that favor a reduction in number of social contacts. The effectiveness of such measures from both group is variable and some is still under debate. Regarding, for example, extensive travel restrictions, a recent systematic review has shown that this intervention may contribute to delaying but not preventing the transmission and diffusion of a viral outbreak. As such, it is not recommended for implementation, if not within a broader package of public health measures aimed at rapidly containing the outbreak 8 . A similar conclusion can be reached for border entry screening, considered as ineffective or poorly effective per se, and therefore needs to be combined and provided together with other strategies 9 . School closure appears to be potentially effective in containing/reducing viral outbreaks, although further research is warranted to identify the best strategy in terms of timing and length of closure 10 . The measure of quarantine is also particularly controversial, since it raises ethical dilemmas, and political and social concerns 11, 12 and quantification of its real impact 11 is difficult due to a high uncertainty in its efficacy. However, in the absence of effective medical interventions, these measures must be implemented and the success of these measures, despite their disruptive impact on social-economic activities, depends heavily on how these measures are adapted to the specific scenario, in terms not only of clinical and epidemiological variables but also of social aspects, including social habits, juridical provisions, and economic-financial resources.",

Here, we add an additional quarantined suspected compartment, which consists of exposed infectious individuals resulting from contact tracing and individuals with common fever. These individuals with common fever but quarantined as COVID-19 suspected contributed to the difficulty of implementing an effective quarantine process due to the size of this compartment. In what follows, exposure, transmission and infection compartments are always used for modeling the COVID-19.",

Our simulation results indicate that the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea will change from a quick to a slow increase if the integrated control measures are implemented, as illustrated in Figure 7 (C).

It follows from Figure 8(A-C) that increasing the parameter reduces the disease infections and the number of suspected individuals, while decreasing the parameter (to zero) slightly affects the disease infections, shown in green curves ( ) and red curves ( ) in Figure 8(A-C). This conversely implies that the prevention and control strategies in Guangdong province were relatively strong from the early stage of the outbreak. This can also be confirmed by the continuously declining trend of the effective reproduction number, as shown in Figure 3 and 8(D). Again, we performed the sensitivity analysis by decreasing the value of in the detection rate and obtained similar results, as shown in Figure 9. Discussion After some initial delay in the response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Chinese government started implementing drastic public health measures on January 23 rd 2020, including the lock-down of Wuhan city, contact tracing/quarantine/isolation. This decisive and systematically implemented package of interventions has contributed to rapid mitigation, providing a window of opportunity for the preparedness, prevention and control of COVID-19 in other Chinese cities and around the world. As we showed in this modeling study, a systematic approach incorporating coherent and complementary public health measures rapidly implemented is the key for containing the viral outbreak. In this study, we formulated a dynamic model and parameterized it by using multi-source data for different settings, like South Korea, China and Guandong province. We predicted that the trend of cumulative reported cases would be very serious, reaching around 600 thousands as of April 1 st 2020 given no control measures being implemented. Hence a comparison with the current COVID-19 epidemic: the cumulative reported cases are around 80,651 as of March 6 th , 2020, indicating the efficacy of the ongoing strengthening of prevention and control measures in mainland China.",
