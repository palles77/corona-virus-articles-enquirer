The following categories have been reported: 1) Lipid and polymer compounds analogous to transfection reagents 112-114 , 2) Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs), also known as protein transduction domains (PTDs) 115,116 , 3) Bacterial toxins and viral components 117-121 , and 4) Engineered nanocarriers 122-124 . Lipid and polymer reagents, while successful for some proteins, are not appropriate for all situations. Unlike DNA and RNA, proteins are vastly different in size, charge, and structure. Thus, lipid and polymeric reagents for intracellular delivery have a limited efficacy for use across a range of different proteins 111 . On the other hand, PTDs and CPPs, can be attached to most proteins but they are prone to endocytic entrapment, cell toxicity, and poor efficiency of cytosolic delivery 125 . Despite promise, the history of PTD and CPP research is troubled by disagreement regarding delivery mechanisms 116,126,127 . Intracellular delivery of proteins using bacterial toxins and viral components is similar in many ways to PTDs and CPPs, but with more precise, well-defined mechanisms 118,121 . Use of bacterial toxins and viral components aims to the mimic pathogenic entry processes by targeting a protein of interest to a particular endocytic pathway, and then triggering natural mechanisms of endosome escape. Unfortunately, this strategy has to be tailored to particular cell types, however, and can be excessively labor-intensive or inaccessible for most researchers seeking to perform protein delivery. The final category of engineered nanocarriers has seen a huge rise in interest over the last 15 years. They can be designed as higher ordered structures with multifunctional and stimuli-responsive properties. Such nanocarriers are constructed from, and functionalized with, combinations of biomolecules, lipids, polymers, and inorganic materials. They have yet to be 14 translated into commercial products. The intracellular delivery of proteins lacks straightforward universal techniques, and typically requires significant amounts of work for robust effects to be observed. The limited success of the abovementioned approaches to intracellular delivery of proteins is reflected by the fact that a comparative study of available techniques for antibody delivery indicated that electroporation is the leading option 125 .",

Delivery of proteins into living cells, such as genome-editing nucleases 128 , active inhibitory antibodies 125 , or stimulatory transcription factors 36 , represents a powerful toolset for manipulating and analyzing cell function 21,22 . For example, the localization and visualization of engineered antibodies within living cells and perturbation of their associated cellular processes may allow a more direct study and functional analysis at a level not possible with genetic methods 125 . As well as classical antibodies (~150 kDa), a number of recombinant small antibodybased molecules such as immunoglobulin (Ig) derived Fab (~50 kD) and scFv (~25 kD), non-Ig derived monobodies (~10 kD), nanobodies (~14 kDa), and affibodies (~6.5 kD) have been developed 129 . When combined with fluorescent labels these antibodies are able to serve as precise functional probes for intracellular imaging applications 130 . Further, there are applications where direct protein delivery is favorable over indirect expression from nucleic acids, for example to avoid the risk of insertional mutagenesis associated with DNA transfection. However, one significant challenge is that the amount of protein delivered has to be sufficient to generate the desired effect, whereas plasmid DNA can be amplified by replication. Unlike nucleic acids, with their uniform properties, one-size-fits-all protein delivery has been elusive due to the inherent variance in size, structure and charge amongst proteins 21,22,131 .",

In the 1980s ASOs were established as tools for performing genetic loss of function studies 210-212 . In these cases, ASOs were either expressed from plasmids or microinjected after in vitro transcription.

Historically, nucleic acids have been the most popular cargo for intracellular delivery experiments performed at a population scale. Genetic modulation with DNA or RNA is viewed as a robust route for controlling cell function. Increasingly, however, researchers are discovering new ways to manipulate cells with other forms of cargo, for example, genome-editing nucleases 15-18 , synthetic intracellular probes 19, 20 , and combinations of proteins and/or inhibitors that guide cell fate 21, 22 . This reflects a transition from the narrowly focused delivery of nucleic acids to a wider concept of \"intracellular delivery\". To illustrate this, figure 1 depicts the diversity of cargo that can be delivered into cells and the potential outcomes. The schematic highlights the progression from input cargo to cellular output states and end-point applications. In all these cases, the prime challenge is that impermeable cargo must be introduced to the cell interior without untoward damage or perturbation to the cell. The five horizontal tiers in figure 1 are not mutually exclusive, having significant overlap between inputs and output. This \"menu\" of options reflects the combinatorial potential of intracellular delivery to analyze cell behaviour and engineer cell function. Through intracellular delivery these cargoes are able to confer the outcome or application depicted on the right. The horizontal tiers are not mutually exclusive and substantial overlap exists between them. Abbreviations: TCR = T cell receptor. CAR = chimeric antigen receptor. CNT = carbon nanotube.

Early results were achieved with expression from potentially mutagenic viral vectors, an approach that is considered problematic for medical applications. To address this concern, iPSCs have since been produced via direct intracellular delivery of proteins 36 , mRNA 37,38 , and microRNA 39 together with small molecules 40 . Medical applications of iPSCs include in vitro expansion for drug screening of patient cells and gene therapy before re-implantation 41 . Reprogrammed iPSCs also offer potential for cell-based regenerative medicine 42 , for example to generate immune-compatible organs for patient transplants 43 , off-the-shelf T cells for cancer immunotherapy 44 , or gene-edited endothelial cells to correct hemophilia 45 . Cargoes of interest for intracellular delivery are highly variable in size, shape, architecture and chemical properties ( Figure 2 ). They range from small hydrophilic molecules around 1 nm, such as the cryoprotectant trehalose, to large micron-sized organelles and microorganisms approaching the size of the cell itself. This scale represents more than 3 orders of magnitude. It also encompasses a diversity of origins, from typical biomolecules like proteins, DNA, and RNA, to synthetic materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), quantum dots, nanoparticles, and microdevices. In the following, we categorize these cargoes for discussion of their properties, delivery challenges, and intracellular applications. This analysis sheds light on how such diverse methods of intracellular delivery came about, and the factors underpinning the emergence of membrane disruption-based delivery as a key approach. ",

Such molecules should ideally be less than 500 Da, of intermediate lipophilicity, of limited hydrogen bonding capacity, and uncharged. These requirements have been used to narrow drug discovery efforts to candidates that are likely to be bioavailable. This is especially important for synthetic molecules, which lack endogenous transport processes. On the other hand, a number of natural products undergo active transport, and in these cases do not need to be permeable or obey Lipinski's rule of 5 52 .

Intracellular delivery enables the deployment of drugs that are larger than 500 Da. An example is bleomycin (Mw 1.4 kDa, ~2 nm diameter), an anti-cancer drug with poor permeability due to its positive charge and hydrophilicity.

Today, the most widespread regents used for transfection use a complex formed between lipids and nucleic acids. The first reports of lipid-based transfections were as early as the 1980s, first with liposomes (1980) 176,177 and then via 'lipofection' with cationic lipids (1987) 178 . The most effective methods were commercialized, with the launch of the cationic lipid-based product lipofectamine in 1993. This was shortly followed with dendrimers like PAMAM 180 from 1993 (\"superfect\" reagent launched in late 1990s) and cationic polymers such as PEI in 1995 179 (marketed as \"polyjet\" soon after). Cationic polymers such as polybrene 181 and poly-L-lysine 182,183 also formed the basis of several transfection technologies. The technique of electroporation was first used for DNA transfection in the early 1980s 184 . This technique remains particularly useful for hard-to-transfect cell types and was commercialized from the mid-1980s by Biorad and others. Today, most transfection is performed with lipid reagents, while polymer reagents and electroporation are the next most popular options. The popularity of these techniques over more efficacious virally mediated transduction methods is due to the relative simplicity of transfection procedures, lower cost, and smaller time investment.",

Because genetic material underlies almost all biological function, transfection is central to biological research, in both academic and industrial settings. Transfection impacts fields from cell biology and genetics to immunology and drug discovery. In the context of biomanufacture, transfection is used for bio-production of proteins, antibodies, viral vectors, and virus-like particles for vaccines. In cellbased therapies, transfection has been critical to ex vivo gene therapy (correcting aberrant genes) 29 , hematopoietic stem cell engineering 30,185 , production of induced pluripotent stem cells 37 , and preparation of cells for immunotherapy [186] [187] [188] . As shown in figure 3 , nucleic acid transfection is currently the dominant category of intracellular delivery. In future, however, demand for delivery of non-nucleic acid materials (for example, antibodies, genome editing nucleases, and synthetic materials) is expected to compete with transfection in several applications 15,18,19,21,22,107 .

Micro RNAs (miRNAs), discovered in 1993 217 , represent the endogenous mechanism of gene silencing.

Third, protein expression resulting from mRNA delivery is dosedependent and rapid, commencing within minutes. Fourth, additional control over the location of protein expression can be conferred by using mRNA, as its specific subcellular delivery can localise protein expression 252 . Fifth, mRNA can be less toxic and less immunogenic than DNA vectors in sensitive cells, making it a preferred option for sensitive cells or applications that require cell high viability. These beneficial aspects of mRNA delivery make it attractive for therapeutic immune cells, where cells types such as T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages are known to be difficult to transfect 234,274-286 . Primary stem cells, cells of the hematopoietic lineage, and neurons are other cell types that have historically proven difficult to transfect [287] [288] [289] [290] . The ability to conduct biological studies in these important cell types is often restricted by limitations on transfection efficiency and tolerance to treatment. Thus, while there has been a huge amount of work on refining transfection approaches over the last decades, there is still significant room for improvement.",

Biochemical methods, such as exposure to pore-forming toxins or detergents, are more scalable but can be harder to control since they are not associated with a discrete event 395 . Upon membrane disruption, cargo begins to diffuse into the cell according to its concentration gradient while some cytoplasmic contents are lost. In certain cases, additional effects, such as electrophoretic force, can also be harnessed to augment influx of cargo. Third, it is important to note that the imposed membrane disruptions are not stable, and thus only allow passage of cargo for a limited time. Upon membrane insult, the target cell responds with active membrane repair processes. Healing of the plasma membrane can take from a few seconds up to several minutes to complete. Once membrane integrity is restored, the cell may engage metabolic and transport processes to restore cytoplasmic composition and bring itself back to full health 398,399 . Most permeabilization strategies apply specific conditions, such as temperature and buffer composition, to first promote permeabilization and delivery, and subsequently facilitate cell recovery. The membrane disruption effect must not be too severe or prolonged, otherwise the cells will be unable to repair and recover. Effective permeabilization strategies must therefore find a balance, optimizing both the membrane damage and cell treatment conditions.",

The permeability of a given molecule or cargo material across the plasma membrane depends on the properties of the membrane (e.g. composition, heterogeneity, thickness), active cellular regulation of the plasma membrane (e.g. protein activity, cytoskeletal interaction), the properties of the molecule itself (e.g. charge, size, polarity), and environmental factors (e.g. temperature) 168,400 .",

For example, relatively high intracellular potassium (140 mM) and low sodium (5-15 mM) are generated by the action of the Na + /K + ATPase, a plasma membrane-embedded transport protein 401 . Intracellular chloride, calcium, and magnesium are all lower than their corresponding extracellular concentrations. The maintenance of these electrolyte gradients is key for the typical negative membrane potential (-35 to -80 mV) of most animal cells and a host of other essential functions. The cell also has elevated intracellular concentrations of metabolites such as ATP (typically 2-5 mM), amino acids and other biomolecules. The difference between intracellular and extracellular composition is an important consideration in membrane disruption-based intracellular delivery, as strategies that take this into account can lead to more efficient treatments and better cell health. Minimizing the depletion of intracellular contents, for example, can improve cell treatment outcomes (see section 4.3).

Slow impalement of a nanowire allows sufficient time for lipids to flow in from the surrounding reservoirs (such as blebs and folds) to compensate for the local increase in membrane tension. On the other hand, rapid impalement does not give the system sufficient time to pull lipids from adjacent areas. Instead, the local membrane tension ramps up to a point where formation of a hole/pore becomes energetically favorable 426 . This helps to explain why larger contact forces are known to increase the probability of membrane penetration when deforming membranes with sharp AFM tips or nanowires 427 , 428 , 429 , 430,431 , 432because the size of the impaling object and the force upon contact determine the local deformation rate, which is in turn related to the probability of membrane disruption.

Here, we will examine how cells respond to membrane disruption (summarized in Figure 11 ). The first response is an urgent call to action to repair the breached membrane. If this is not accomplished rapidly, the cell will die. The second major response from the cell is after membrane repair, where it seeks to rebalance the homeostasis of its membrane composition and intracellular contents. This response takes place over minutes to hours and will determine whether the cell returns to its previous state, lives with permanent alterations, or dies through a form of programmed cell death. This section provides an overview of these events and the strategies and concepts associated with their manipulation in order to optimize membrane disruption-based intracellular delivery. Figure 11 . Cell response to membrane disruption. First, plasma membrane repair (PMR) engages within seconds to rescue the cell. If PMR fails the cell depolarizes, swells, and dies. Shown are the altered cytoplasmic contents that eventuate if membrane disruption is conducted in a physiological buffer. If PMR is successful, the cell is left in a perturbed state with loss of cytosol. Stress response guides the cell to return to the pre-perturbation homeostatic state or into apoptosis. In some cases, trauma or off-target damage involved with disruption-recovery cycle may cause mutations, fate changes, or loss of cell potency.",

For example, a decrease in cytosolic potassium can lead cells into a quiescent state characterized by autophagy (recycling of cellular building blocks), formation of lipid droplets to conserve energy, and arrest in global translation 495 . Time taken to restore intracellular potassium homeostasis correlates with the duration of these effects 495 . Furthermore, a drop in potassium is thought to be responsible for activation of MAP kinase stress response and proteolytic signaling cascades including the inflammasome, which in turn trigger downstream effectors including caspase proteins and the unfolded protein response 399, [510] [511] [512] [513] . In all systems tested so far, pore-forming toxins activate the three main MAP kinase stress response pathways: p38, JNK, and ERK 399, [514] [515] [516] [517] . Cell permeabilization in media containing high potassium prevents MAP kinase activation, indicating that potassium depletion is the key trigger 518,519 . MAP kinase and its downstream effectors promote cell survival and their inhibition appears to worsen cell death after membrane disruption 518,519 . Whether or not pre-activation of MAP kinase pathways can improve survival upon membrane disruption-mediated delivery remains unexplored.",

In our analysis, cell media (37%) and Na-rich buffers (34%) are the most popular, ahead of buffered sugar solutions (17%) and K-rich buffers (9%) ( Table 2 ). Deconstructing these trends by modes of membrane disruption reveals further insights. For example, buffered sugar solutions have historically been used by the electroporation community to avoid electrolytic effects associated with higher conductivity salt-based buffers 531, 532 . Their origins can be traced back to the beginnings of the field in the late 1970s and onwards 502, 531, [533] [534] [535] [536] [537] [538] . In contrast, physical non-electroporation-based methods, such as mechanical wounding and optoporation, have mostly opted for cell media (58%) or Na-rich buffers (32%). Biochemical methods, of which detergents and pore-forming toxins are the main options, have been the most likely to experiment with K-rich \"intracellular\" buffers (22%) but most often used their Na-rich counterparts (43%). Biochemical permeabilization methods, which have less control over the timing of membrane disruption, seem more concerned with maintaining intracellular homeostasis through implementation of K-rich buffers 539,540 . Whether K-rich intracellular mimicking buffers are under-utilized in membrane disruption-mediated delivery remains to be established.",

Additionally, strong pH buffering probably helps to negate potential detrimental effects of electrolytic reactions in the case of electroporation. Magnesium is slightly antagonistic to calcium, possibly helping to blunt some of the damaging aspects of calcium influx 443 . It is also a co-factor to hundreds of intracellular enzymes, including those involved in energy metabolism and stabilization of mitochondrial membranes 561, 562 . ATP supplementation might be beneficial not only in preventing its loss from the cytoplasm 397 , but also in engaging extracellular receptors to activate 'purinergic' signaling, which is thought to prime cells against the danger of membrane disruption 456, 563 . As an example of its potential benefits, electroporation buffers supplemented with ATP help to achieve faster gene expression after plasmid delivery 564 . Glucose is added to some buffer formulations 146,551 and would tend to prevent cell energy depletion due to cytoplasmic leakage. Anti-oxidants have been reported to promote membrane repair and overall cell health by neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) [466] [467] [468] . ROS may damage proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, the latter of which can lead to mutations in DNA. Most of the optimized buffers also tend to contain little or no Ca 2+ . Although it is the prime trigger for membrane repair, precise studies have shown that only ~5 -20 \u03bcM is required [565] [566] [567] . Normal extracellular Ca 2+ levels (~1 mM) are probably only helpful when cells are returned back to standard media for final recovery.",

Despite this, there is no consensus in the literature on which temperatures are best for membrane disruptionbased intracellular delivery. An analysis of more than 300 membrane disruption-based delivery papers analyzed in compiling this review reveals three categories of temperature that have been used: 1) \u22644 \u00b0C; 2) room temperature (usually in the range 18-25 \u00b0C); and 3) ~37 \u00b0C ( Table 3 ). The rationale for treating cells at \u22644 \u00b0C is that it can facilitate a preservative effect. Most stress responses and programmed cell death pathways are inhibited at 4 \u00b0C, so unless the cell is killed by the treatment itself, the long-term cell survival may be improved. One detergent-based protocol credited low temperature and intracellular buffer as the two main factors increasing cell survival 539 . Biochemical protocols employed \u22644 \u00b0C 38% of the time compared with 11% for electroporation and 12% for physical non-electroporation. Low temperatures probably slow down membrane repair, but it also makes cells more resistant to disruption, particularly electroporation 574, 575 . Furthermore, many pore-forming toxins do not assemble at 4 \u00b0C, so a switch to warmer conditions can be used as a trigger to control the timing of permeabilization 576 . (Table 3) . Membrane repair and stress response are expected to be at their most efficient at 37 \u00b0C.",

The first mRNA expression studies were carried out by microinjection from 1973 onward 240-242, 605 . Viral DNA was injected into cells to investigate its ability to transform cells 606 As illustrated in the above examples, microinjection is a versatile delivery platform, being able to deliver almost any cargo to most cell types. In its current form, microinjection is commonly performed with commercial systems fitted with glass micropipettes of diameter 0.3 to 1.0 \u03bcm ( Figure 13A ). It is important to note that microinjection does suffer some degree of cell type-dependence. Small cells, such as blood cells with diameters less then 10 \u03bcm, can be challenging to microinject due to their small volume and poor tolerance for needle penetration 609 . For non-adherent or suspension cells an additional holding pipette is used to keep cells in place ( Figure 13B ), but this adds to the complexity and timeconsuming nature of the procedure. Researchers and clinicians most often use microinjection for experiments or procedures involving single cells or small batches of cells where high fidelity of intracellular delivery is ensured. For example, due to its accuracy and control, microinjection has been a routine technique to achieve human pregnancies by in vitro fertilization. where the penetrating aperture consists of a nanotube.

Exploiting a different mechanism of volume control, an electrochemical attosyringe with tip diameter of 100 -400 nm achieved picoliter to attoliter volume control 611 . Such fine electrochemical control of fluid motion allowed the accurate dispensation of precise volumes from the fabricated 'nanopipette' 611 . Another group employed carbon nanotubes as the pipette. The device, termed a nanotube endoscope, demonstrated delivery of fluorescent molecules to subcellular localizations at a resolution down to 100 nm 612 .

For unknown reasons, this innovation was not widely adopted. Other attempts at high-throughput microinjection include a vacuum-enabled embryo holding array, which allows injections based on robotic motion control and image recognition by computer vision processing 622 . The reported throughput of 15 cells per minute was demonstrated to yield a high survival rate (98%) for large non-adherent cells such as embryos and oocytes. In a semi-automatic approach, a micro-robotic system achieved up to 25 injections per minute on adherent endothelial cells 623 . The human operator selects injection destinations through mouse clicking on a computer screen and the system executes with a purported survival rate of >95% and a success rate of >80% 623 .",

Several picoliters of liquid could be injected into the cell in ~0.5 seconds followed by flow reversal of the main channel to dislodge the cell 624 . The cell could be then routed through an exit channel for collection after delivery 624 . Problems with cell clogging and fouling from biological debris, however, prevented the device from achieving consistent operation.

Particles then collide with target cells, busting through the plasma membrane and releasing cargo molecules from their surface into the cytosol ( Figure 14A ).

The more advanced biolistic systems employ a vacuum chamber for higher momentum and evenness of microparticle dispersion. The vacuum systems are typically used for in vitro applications where the sample is more amenable to manipulation. A major weakness of biolistic delivery is the damage that high velocity particles can cause to cells. This is one of the reasons why it is popular for plants, which have stiff cell walls that can tolerate harsh mechanical impacts 626 . Damage from gene guns has been identified as a key limiting factor in treatment of cell cultures in vitro, as well as skin and muscle tissues 671 . In general, damage is intensified as the projectile diameter increases relative to the cell size. Nanoparticles of ~40 nm have been tested with the biolistic method and found to provide better cell survival, especially with small cells 672 . ~80 nm silver nanoparticles were also evaluated and found to transmit less damage to cells 673 . In both cases delivery efficiency of cargo was not reported to be adversely compromised by using nanoparticles instead of micro-sized beads, and the higher surface area to volume ratio of nanoparticles could be a potential advantage.",

The first cargo to be delivered with them was DNA plasmids, which were physically absorbed or covalently tethered to the tips of the conical nanowires. CHO cells were then forced against the array by centrifugation at 600 g followed by sandwiching against an opposing substrate. This provided an active force for penetration, which proved to be necessary for efficient transfection in this system ( Figure 15A ). The nanowires were able to achieve nuclear penetration as evidenced by rapid GFP expression. Interestingly, GFP plasmids that were physically absorbed to the nanowires were passed on to cell progeny while covalently tethered plasmids were not, suggesting that the former dissociate in the cell interior while the latter are able to mediate gene expression even though they remained attached to the nanostructures. In follow-up studies the same researchers extended the application of nanowires to include spatially indexed substrates for long-term cell tracking 676 and simultaneous delivery of multiple different plasmids 677 .

Using a model that estimates traction forces associated with long term cell adhesion, calculations of 1.5 to 6 nN were obtained for cells cultured on ~100 nm diameter nanowires 428 . In another case, active centrifugation of a grid of diamond nanowires was used to poke holes in cells for diffusive delivery of cargo from the extracellular solution 694 . They estimated a force of ~2 nN was needed to breach the membrane with ~400 nm diameter nanowires. Other groups have used AFM to directly quantify the forces of penetration for different diameter objects. Another study with larger AFM probe tips estimated that the forces required to penetrate supported lipid membranes range from 5 nN for a sharp (<300 nm diameter) nanoneedle probe to 20 nN for a standard pyramidal tip 432 . However, the supported lipid membranes may be more difficult to break through than a cell plasma membrane, depending on approach speed, temperature, and other factors. One group used antibodies attached to nanowires to detect membrane penetration and found that lowering temperature to 4 \u00b0C appeared to improve nanowire penetration by reducing membrane adaptability 427 . Together, mechanistic studies indicate that biological membranes under physiological conditions are able to passively adjust to nanowire conformations, and therefore factors such as small tip area, low temperature, high forces and/or approach velocities may facilitate effective penetration of the plasma membrane.",

Cargo delivery mechanism versus scale of throughput for nano-and micro-mechanical membrane disruption techniques. For injection mechanisms, the nano-or micro-mechanical element is hollow, thus allowing injection of cargo. Dissociation-based delivery works by enabling cargo to detach from the penetrating element once inside the cell. For permeabilization, the cargo is in the extracellular solution and flows into the cell by diffusion upon withdrawal of the penetrating element. References for each example are included. above. Single cell versions of nanowire delivery have also been explored. One system attached multi-walled CNTs of 10-20 nm diameter and up to 1.5 \u03bcm length to AFM tips to deliver quantum dots to selected single cells 708 . Dissociation was achieved by the action of intracellular enzymes that cleave the linker holding the cargo to the penetrating CNT 708 . AFMcontrolled nanoneedles sculpted by focused ion beams have been shown to provide nuclear penetration and mediate gene expression 430,431,695,709 . Another method used a ~500 nm diameter gold nanowire to penetrate mouse embryos and release plasmids inside. The plasmids are released through dissociation triggered by an electric pulse. Because the technique is thought to be less violent, embryo survival was reported to be significantly higher than traditional microinjection 713 .",

Furthermore, open questions remain regarding the membrane conformation adopted around nanowires and the subsequent degree of penetration.

            "text": "Among the earliest reported mechanical cell permeabilization methods were those published by Paul McNeil and colleagues in the 1980s, which include scrape loading 96 and glass bead loading 97 . In scrape loading, a rubber spatula is passed over a cell-laden substrate to dislodge adherent cells and bring them into solution, hence the technique is only applicable to adherent cells ( Figure 16A ). Moreover, the amount of damage to each cell is stochastic, with some cells being instantly killed while others remain almost unaffected. In cells that receive optimal amounts of membrane damage, cargo molecules dispersed in solution diffuse through transient membrane disruptions to achieve delivery. Glass bead loading involves shaking the adherent cells with medium containing glass beads and the cargo to be delivered ( Figure   16B ). The impact of collisions between beads and cells imparts sufficient strain to generate disruptions in the plasma membrane. Again, the magnitude of plasma membrane damage that each cell sustains is highly variable and may lead to inconsistent delivery and cell survival. The generation of cellular and biological debris may be another problematic aspect of cell scraping and bead loading. Moreover, delivery of expensive reagents that need to be concentrated into small volumes can be difficult to achieve with these protocols. On the other hand, potential benefits include the low-cost and accessible nature, as these methods can be performed with common lab equipment. In applications where high cell viability is not a priority, scraping and bead loading may represent convenient options. A later adaption of bead loading termed 'immunoporation' used beads functionalized with antibodies to bind to cells and permeabilize them by ripping off bits of their membranes 724-730 . fluorescently-labeled nucleotides 765 , and quantum dots 744 has been achieved in cells adjacent to the scratch zone. Although the method is lower throughput than scrape loading, one advantage of scratch loading is that cells remain adherent for immediate analysis.",

The technique, termed \"filtroporation\", works by forcing cell suspensions through uniformly-sized micropores in commercially available track-etched polycarbonate filters ( Figure 16C ). In the reported study, a polycarbonate filter of approximately 12 \u00b5m thick with pore sizes ranging from 5-18 \u00b5m was used. Plasmid DNA and dextran-conjugates up to 500 kDa were successfully delivered into CHO cells of nominal diameter ~13 \u00b12 \u00b5m. The cell suspensions were driven through the polycarbonate filter by a pressure regulator supplying constant pressures of 0 to 175 kPa. Delivery efficiency and cell damage were both increased as a function of driving pressure. Severity of the treatment also increased as the micropore diameter was decreased when all other parameters were held constant. By tuning parameters, optimal conditions of 8 \u00b5m pore size and driving pressure of 35 kPa were identified in ~13 \u00b5m CHO cells. Thus, the cells experienced 40% constriction of their diameter as they passed through the polycarbonate filter. These conditions permitted uptake of a luciferase reporter plasmid, which resulted in transfection of the cells with a reported transfection efficiency above 50% after 2 days in culture. Despite these results, further work on filtroporation is absent from the literature as the technique does not appear to have gained traction.",

Until this point, most results had been obtained in microfabricated silicon devices 108 . By using repeated arrays of constrictions fabricated from PDMS, Qin and co-workers reported delivery of single-stranded DNA, siRNA, and plasmids into HEK cells and several other cell lines 792 . Moreover, they demonstrated genome editing in MCF7 and HeLa cells via delivery of plasmids that express Cas9 and gRNA, although transfection efficiencies were not directly reported 792 . In a subsequent study, the group modified their device architecture to perform siRNA delivery to cancer cells with a repeated pattern of 5 \u03bcm constrictions in a reverse wishbone configuration 788 ( Figure 17C ). Experiments and simulations both indicate that the sharper constrictions conferred by the reverse wishbone intensified the local stress on the plasma membrane to increase the magnitude of membrane disruption 788 . Another of this group's publications featured sharp star-shaped constrictions to facilitate delivery of dextrans, siRNA, and Cas9 RNPs to the intracellular space of hardto-transfect suspension cell lines and T cells 152 . By delivering RNPs targeting GFP, they were able to achieve CRISPRmediated GFP knockout in several standard cell lines. Also demonstrated was low-efficiency CRISPR-mediated knock-in editing of the PD-1 gene in primary T cells, an application that could be relevant for cell-based therapies 152 .",

An unresolved issue is whether off-target damage may be inflicted upon intracellular structures, such as the cytoskeleton, nucleus, and even genomic DNA. For example, it has been observed that cells migrating through tight constrictions undergo transient nuclear ruptures and DNA damage 789 . As the stiffest large object in the cell, the nucleus is widely regarded as the determining factor governing passage of cells through micron-sized constrictions 795, 796 . It has also been observed that apoptotic and cell stress response can significantly impact cell survival after passage of cells through constrictions 797 . Lamins, which mechanically reinforce the nuclear envelope, play a protective role in physically buffering the nucleus from mechanical stress and their depletion is known to make cells more vulnerable to death after passage through constrictions 797 . Moreover, DNA damage has previously been observed with imposed cyclic mechanical stresses in certain cell types 798 . Experiments from Ding and colleagues that visualized nuclear disruptions with CHMP4B-GFP indicated that squeezing HeLa cells (nuclear diameter ~8-12 \u03bcm) through 7 \u03bcm constrictions did not disrupt the nuclear envelope 787 . Because disruption of the nuclear envelope can be associated with DNA damage, it indicates genomic DNA may be safe even when cells are squeezed by more than 50% of their initial diameter. Moreover, measurements of DNA damage with a high throughput COMET assay 799 failed to indicate significant DNA damage in HeLa cells forced through 6 \u03bcm constrictions (unpublished observations). However, further investigations with different types of cells (particularly those of clinical relevance) may be required to fully address the question of off-target DNA damage.",

In these cases, nanowires are thrusted into the cells followed by withdrawal to promote diffusive influx from the surrounding media ( Figure 16E ). This mode of plasma membrane penetration is similar to the nanowires/nanostraws described in section 5.3, except that the delivery mechanism is via diffusion through a permeabilized plasma membrane rather than dissociation from the nanoneedles themselves. In one notable example, a grid of diamond nanowires was centrifuged onto cultured cells at controlled forces using standard lab centrifuges 694 . Thin diamond nanowires were fabricated by first depositing a nanodiamond film on silicon wafers followed by microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition to grow a uniform field of needles. In the versions used for experiments, dimensions were optimized to ~300 nm diameter and ~4.5 \u00b5m height with straight sidewalls at a density of ~6 nanowires per 10 x 10 \u00b5m 2 . It was found that nanowires of diameter >800 nm caused excessive damage to cells, but those < 400 nm produced a suitable balance between delivery efficiency and cell damage. For this geometry, it was calculated that centrifugation at 300 r.p.m. yields ~2 nN penetration force per nanowire, which was claimed to be an ideal penetration force for monolayers of cells grown in culture. Upon withdrawal of nanowires from cells, influx of IgG antibodies, ~20 nm quantum dots, and ~200 nm polystyrene nanoparticles into the cytoplasm of primary neurons was demonstrated. Furthermore, by packaging DNA with lipid-based lipofectamine complexes, plasmid transfection in neurons was boosted from around 1-5% (lipofectamine alone) to almost 50% with additional nanowire permeabilization. If nanowire permeabilization were used with naked DNA alone, transfection efficiency was <1%, suggesting that: 1) centrifuged nanowires did not consistently permeabilize the nucleus, and 2) that lipid complexes may facilitate nuclear targeting and protect the DNA from premature degradation. Thus, direct cytosolic delivery of DNA-lipid complexes may boost transfection efficiency in otherwise difficult-to-transfect cells such as neurons.",

Alternatively, a jet of water molecules propelled perpendicularly into a membrane can pierce it in an analogous way to a mechanical object 802 . Unlike membrane disruption via solid contact (discussed above), fluid shear forces are less invasive. On the flipside, fluid shear forces in aqueous environments tend to be more difficult to control. In this section we discuss the strategies and methods that have been used to perform membrane disruption-based intracellular delivery by harnessing fluid shear forces. First, we will explore shear forces generated by flow of fluid past microscale channels and objects. Second, acoustic sonoporation, which is thought to depend mainly on the forces associated with cavitation bubbles, will be discussed.

The flow rate is a critical parameter as it determines the velocity of the cells traversing the constriction zone and thus the shear forces they experience. A typical syringe loading protocol consists of eight passes of cell suspension through a 1 ml syringe affixed with a 30 G needle, which has an inner diameter of 160 \u00b5m 98 . In the initial publication, delivery of cargo sizes up to 150 kDa were obtained in several mammalian cell lines 98 . Furthermore, the addition of pluronic F-68 (also known as poloxamer 188) was found to increase the tolerance of cells to membrane permeabilizing shear forces, thereby enabling the cells to undergo harsher treatments and improve cell survival. In the cell types tested, syringe loading in the presence of pluronic F-68 appeared more efficient than both bead and scrape loading 98 . Low-volume versions of the protocol were also developed, using a 25 \u00b5l Hamilton syringe with 25 G fixed needle (inner diameter 260 \u00b5m) for 80 passes. A 5 \u00b5l version of the protocol was described with a 10 \u00b5l micropipette tip (inner diameter not reported) involving 60 passes.",

In one example, it has been used to perform DNA transfection 803 . Using a selection strategy, stable integration of plasmid DNA into the genome of host CHO and mouse Ltk(-) cells was estimated in approximately one of every 50,000 cells treated, which was considered a success given the low cost of the technique 803 . Ghosh and colleagues found that syringe loading could deliver neutrally charged antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholinos into cells for the purpose of gene silencing 804 . Moreover, the same delivery strategy has been used for loading of small molecular weight nucleotides, GTP and GDP (~0.5 kDa), and their analogues to explore G-protein biology in immune cells and endothelial cells 805, 806 . In another application, fluorescent labeling of the neuronal cytosol was achieved when trypsinized ganglia were syringe-loaded with dye-conjugated 10 kDa dextrans 807 . The most common application of syringe loading has been delivery of proteins and antibodies to the intracellular space.",

Because the fluid flow is controlled manually, however, it may require extensive empirical testing and skill to reproducibly obtain optimal cell treatments 820 . Improved precision and reproducibility could potentially be achieved by using microfluidic devices to generate consistent zones of fluid shear. Along these lines, Prausnitz and colleagues fabricated a simple flow-through microfluidic device with parallel constrictions 821 ( Figure 18B ). Lasers were used to bore out 50 -300 \u00b5m conical microchannels from 100 to 250 \u00b5m thick mylar sheets and syringe pumps were employed to flow cell suspensions through the channels at controlled flow rates, thereby subjecting cells to well-defined shear forces. The resultant loading of fluorescently labeled dextrans and proteins into DU145 prostate cancer cells, as well as the viability, however, turned out to be less favorable than syringe loading. Further attempts towards plasma membrane permeabilization through microfluidic control of shear forces have not been reported and therefore present an opportunity for future investigations.",

When forces were too high, cells peeled away from the substrate. After empirical optimization, however, conditions were identified where all cells remained attached to the substrate yet 16% of cells retained 4 kDa 823 .

First, high intensity focused ultrasound was gaining prominence as a non-invasive method for therapeutic treatment of targeted cells and tissues in vivo 834, 835 . Examples include local tissue ablation, local drug delivery stimulated by ultrasound, and, gene therapy by targeted nucleic acid transfection 836 . Second, the mechanisms of ultrasonic effects were being increasingly clarified, with cavitation bubbles implicated as the prime instigators of membrane disruption 837 . These mechanistic insights enabled a more rational approach toward sonoporation that greatly boosted its efficiency. Particularly key was the deployment of gas body ultrasound contrast agents to act as cavitation nuclei. This modification was found to drastically improve transfection efficiency compared to ultrasound alone 831, 838 . For example, commercially available microbubbles were mixed with cultured immortalized human chondrocytes and exposed to 1.0 MHz ultrasound transmitted through the bottom of a six well culture plate. The addition of microbubble cavitation nuclei, along with other empirical optimizations, enhanced DNA transfection nearly 20-fold over previous reports and indicated that ultrasound could be a feasible DNA transfection technique 838 .",

Recent reviews have covered the sonoporation field in detail [839] [840] [841] [842] [843] [844] . The mechanisms underlying sonoporation are diverse and may involve: 1) microstreaming caused by stable cavitation, whereby a cavitation bubble oscillates in synchrony with the acoustic field ( Figure 18E ), 2) jetting forces from inertial cavitation, which is triggered by the collapse of a cavitation bubble ( Figure   18D ), 3) a shrinking cavitation bubble pulling against the plasma membrane 845 , 4) an expanding cavitation bubble pushing against the plasma membrane 845 , 5) bubble translation, whereby acoustic radiation forces push a bubble through the plasma membrane, 6) nucleation of a cavitation bubble between bilayer leaflets, rupturing the membrane upon expansion, and 7) non-bubble acoustic effects, such as acoustic streaming due to pressure differences of the acoustic field 840, 842, 846 .",

On the other hand, a bubble that implodes (inertial cavitation) can trigger extreme phenomena including electromagnetic radiation (sonoluminescence), severe temperature spikes up to thousands of degrees, sonochemical reactions such as the production of free radicals, and intense microjetting. Although any of those phenomena can perturb lipid bilayers, the permeabilizing effects of bubble collapse have primarily been ascribed to the potent fluid shear forces generated by microjetting 840, 842, 846 . As a cavitation bubble implodes, surrounding water molecules rush in to fill the void. If there is a surface nearby (such as a lipid membrane) less water molecules are available to flow from that region. This biases the flow towards that surface and results in the microjet being oriented in that direction. Thus, imploding cavitation bubbles can result in the selective puncture of an adjacent cell ( Figure 17D ). High pressure ultrasound is more likely to trigger inertial cavitation while low pressure procedures bias the system toward stable cavitation 842 .",

Under conditions where large holes are generated, sonoporation can be expected to enable delivery of small and large cargos alike. Because of the motivation for gene therapy, significant efforts have gone into optimizing sonoporation for DNA transfection over the last two decades 830, 831, 833, 838, [853] [854] [855] [856] [857] [858] [859] .

This explanation could be applicable to larger cargo such as plasmid DNA, where delayed expression kinetics akin to electroporation have been observed 846 .

In the early days of sonoporation in the late 1980s and early 1990s, however, there were several examples of biologists using it to carry out basic research 827, 829, 873, 887, 888 . Although at least one commercial sonoporation system has been available for more than a decade (Sonidel SP100), its use for intracellular delivery appears confined within the ultrasound community 891, 892 . The most significant challenge for sonoporation in vitro remains the random and uncontrolled nature of cavitation events leading to excessive cell damage and death 844 . A 2012 review of 26 published studies conducted over more than a decade concluded that conventional in vitro sonoporation with nucleation agents almost never yielded above 50% for both delivery efficiency and cell viability 844 . Poor viabilities are perhaps due to cavitation-related side effects such as high local temperatures and generation of reactive oxygen species 893 . Thus, bulk sonoporation may be inherently limited as a delivery approach in vitro. In vivo applications have been more promising 836 , especially in skin where optimal parameters have been identified and barriers to delivery of therapeutic cargo are more on the tissue, rather than cellular, level 839 .",

            "text": "So far, we have covered membrane disruption arising from acoustic pressure waves and shock waves, as well as cavitation phenomena triggered by these stimuli. Cavitation can also be triggered and/or controlled in a more direct manner by the action of lasers incident upon an absorbent agent in an aqueous environment 911, 912 . The absorbent agent may be the membrane itself, a photoabsorbent molecule added to solution, a particle suspended in solution, or a material interfacing with the solution (Figure 19 ). When the plasma membrane absorbs laser energy and is disrupted ( Figure 19A ), this is known as optoporation and is covered in section 6.4. If the absorbing agent is in direct contact with the plasma membrane, the membrane will likely be perforated by a complex combination of secondary effects including extreme heat, near-field plasmas, and phenomena related to growth and collapse of cavitation bubbles ( Figure 19B ). If the absorbing agent is distant from the plasma membrane, membrane disruption is much simpler and cleaner: it most likely occurs by fluid shear ( Figure 19C ) as thermal effects and near-field plasmas do not propagate very far in an aqueous environment. In any of the above three scenarios ( Figure 19A-C) , the membrane may be disrupted by laser-induced cavitation. Upon absorption, the energy supplied by the laser is transduced into heat and/or chemical effects that lead to vaporization of surrounding liquid to create cavitation bubbles 911, 912 . The bubbles disrupt cell membranes in the same way as sonoporation, either by microjetting after collapse ( Figure 18D ), through microstreaming from bubble oscillation ( Figure 18E ), or through secondary effects. Most reports of laser-induced cavitation suggest bubble collapse, but there are a few cases where laser pulsing regimes can be tuned to sustain bubble oscillations 913 . Figure 19 . Mechanisms of laser-induced membrane disruption. (A) Laser optoporation occurs when incident energy is absorbed by the plasma membrane, directly disrupting it. This is known as \"Optoporation\" and is covered in section 6.4. (B) Membrane disruption eventuates as the result of laser absorption by an absorbing agent in contact with the cell (such as a particle or interface), which then generates secondary effects (heat, fluid shear, near-field plasma etc.) to disrupt the plasma membrane. (C) Membrane disruption eventuates through laser absorption by an absorbing agent distant from the plasma membrane. In these cases, fluid shear from cavitation and/or shock waves is the most likely cause of membrane disruption.",

            "text": "In a series of studies by Ohl and colleagues, microfluidic confinement was used to investigate the relationship between membrane damage and proximity to laser-induced cavitation bubbles 914 . The photo-absorbent molecule phenol red was added to solution to allow generation of cavitation bubbles from the laser focal region. Their results showed that the probability of cell permeabilization by cavitation bubble collapse could be modeled as a function of the distance of cells from the bubble and maximum cavitation bubble radius 914 . In a follow up study, they took advantage of arrayed microfluidic cell traps to immobilize myleoma cells and systematically analyze the conditions for controlled permeabilization at single cell level 487 . Again, phenol red was used as an absorbing agents to facilitate the production of laser-induced cavitation bubbles that expand to ~100 \u00b5m diameter and collapse within tens of microseconds 487 . High frame rate imaging clearly visualized the expansion and shrinkage of cavitation bubbles in a non-symmetric manner due to the presence of a nearby structure. During bubble collapse, a fast microjet was directed toward the cell to generate a single large pore with diameters ranging from 0.2 to several \u00b5m. The diffusive uptake of trypan blue dye into the cell then took place over several seconds. If the standoff distance between cell and bubble were greater than 30 \u00b5m, no membrane disruption occurred. One concern highlight by the authors was whether cavitation bubbles perturb cells through temperature spikes. To address this issue, Ohl and colleagues performed another study with fluorescence-based thermometry to measure local temperature gradients around laser-induced bubbles 915 . Under similar conditions as their previous experiments, it was found that the temperature rises are moderate (< 12.8 \u00b0C), localized (< 15 \u00b5m) and short lived (< 1.3 ms). Thus, by developing a cavitation regime that damages cell membranes purely through mechanical forces, laser-induced cavitation may be amenable to implementation on a wider scale. It was suggested that arraying cells in microfluidic traps would allow for potential scale-up with pre-determined laser protocols to control the size and position of membrane-permeabilizing cavitation bubbles.",

By adjusting particle numbers, size, and laser energy delivered to the metal microspheres it was possible to tune the treatment either toward killing cancer cells for potential therapeutic purposes or transiently increasing the permeability of the plasma membrane for intracellular delivery 916 .

Rather than thermal effects, they proposed that the mechanism of membrane disruption was primarily due to a carbon-steam reaction at the particle surface, which subsequently propagates cavitation-related acoustic forces 919, 920 . Delivery of dyes, proteins, siRNA and plasmid DNA were achieved with acceptable cell viabilities in several cancer cell lines 919, 921 . Control experiments verified that neither the carbon black particles nor laser exposure alone were sufficient to enable molecular uptake 919 . This intracellular delivery concept was then extended beyond adherent cells to homogenous suspensions of carbon black nanoparticles and cells, which may be more amenable to treatment at higher throughputs 922 .",

The use of cavitation bubbles for plasma membrane disruption has received the most attention to date due to the ability to control them remotely via acoustic fields and lasers. Because of the inherently unstable and powerful nature of cavitation, challenges remain in how to harness them for reproducible and consistent cell treatments. Cavitation bubbles, however, have demonstrated the ability to delivery almost any cargo to a wide range of cell types. In future we anticipate intriguing and innovative devices able to deploy highly localized fluid shear forces for precise membrane disruption, perhaps through the use of lab-on-chip, microfluidic, and nanotechnological systems.",

When a cell is placed into a low osmolarity solution water rushes into the cell through the plasma membrane and aquaporin channels to solvate impermeable intracellular electrolytes and osmolytes. The subsequent swelling of cell volume leads to the unfolding of loose membrane, followed by well-described lipid bilayer rupture if area strain exceeds 2-3% ( Figure 20A ).

Although dead, ghosts can reseal and regain a limited set of functions. The concept was first established in red blood cells (RBCs) throughout the 1960s [933] [934] [935] . Although RBCs possess little surface reservoirs compared to most nucleated cells, their capacity to reseal after a brief hypotonic shock is well-proven 936, 937 . Indeed, RBC ghosts were able enclose molecular cargo and even retain some basic biological functions despite being hollowed out of cytoplasmic components 937, 938 . In one early study, by adding ferritin at various times after the onset of hemolysis, it was determined that most cells were permeable for 15-25 seconds after hypotonic shock 939 . Furthermore, the size and shape of membrane disruptions, as seen in fixed cells by SEM imaging, resembled long, narrow tears up to 1 \u00b5m long 940 . Later more accurate studies, however, indicated smaller holes around tens of nanometers or less 941 . Further adaption of the technique optimized the hypotonic lysis procedures to result in high efficiency loading of proteins and enzymes into RBC ghosts 938, 942, 943 . Partly due to such ease of hypotonic loading and autologous biocompatibility, RBC ghosts have been proposed as drug carriers for decades [944] [945] [946] [947] . Furthermore, fusion of loaded RBC ghosts into recipient cells was a popular method of intracellular delivery in the 1970s and 1980s 87,938,948,949 before falling out of favor with the rise of electroporation and other alternatives 544 .",

It wasn't until the early 1980s that osmotic delivery methods would be translated beyond RBCs into other cell types. In 1982, Borle and Snowdowne devised a simple procedure to deliver the calcium-sensitive protein aequorin (21 kDa) into nucleated cells 92,93 . Washed pellets of monkey kidney cells were suspended and immersed in a ~10 mOsm hypotonic solution consisting of 3 mM MgATP, 3 mM HEPES buffer, and a given concentration of aequorin for 2 minutes at 4 \u00b0C. This was followed by sufficient addition of buffered KCl to restore isotonicity. Cells were then incubated in standard cell media for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C to promote restoration of homeostasis before experiments. Optical readouts of aequorin activity indicated that it had been loaded successfully into fully functional cells, and it was used to measure accurate intracellular calcium concentrations of ~50 nM.",

They were motivated by the need to accurately measure intracellular calcium dynamics in follicular lymphoma B cells, an application where the aequorin protein offers higher signal-to-noise ratio, better dynamic range, and more reliable calcium readouts than commonly used small fura dyes. In their method, cell suspensions of 30 \u00b5l were added to 200 \u00b5l of pH buffered hypo-osmotic solution (~2 mOsm) and 0.1 mg mL -1 aequorin before gentle mixing. After a pre-determined duration of hypotonic exposure, addition of 230 \u00b5l hyperosmotic solution was used to bring the suspension back to isotonic conditions and enable membrane recovery. To test the cell response to hypo-osmotic exposure, the time between addition of hypo-osmotic and return to isotonic conditions was varied from 10 seconds to 10 minutes. They found that treatment times of 10-30 seconds were ineffective in loading aequorin (21 kDa) or GFP (28 kDa). Upon two minutes exposure, long term cell viability up to 18 hours was more than 50% with sufficient delivery to determine intracellular calcium concentrations, which turned out to be ~0.9 \u03bcM in follicular lymphoma cells. 10 minutes exposure led to robust delivery but a gradual loss of viability in almost all cells after 10 hours, probably due to delayed cell death responses (see section 4.3). One major advantage of Klabusay's protocol is its applicability to treat difficult-to-transfect suspension cells and that it appears agnostic to cell size and type of cargo material to be delivered.",

The hypotonic buffer consists of 10 mM HEPES for pH buffering and 30 mM KCl (~70 mOsm). Cells were exposed to the hypotonic buffer for 5 mins before a return to isotonic media for recovery. After treatment, metabolic production of DNA, RNA, and protein was inhibited and took ~4 hours to return to normal levels. No loss of viability or apoptosis was observed. The hypotonic shift method was reported to be highly effective for smaller molecules ~1 kDa but efficiency decreased for cargo of greater molecular weight. For example, the procedure was unable to deliver large proteins such as labeled antibodies. Koberna et al.'s hypotonic shift approach has been particularly popular for intracellular delivery of labeled nucleotides [952] [953] [954] [955] [956] [957] [958] [959] [960] .

A prime example is tail vein injection, where robust transfection of hepatocytes and sometimes other cardiovascular tissues has been observed in rodents 978, 979 . In a mouse model, transfection is achieved by fast injection (~5 seconds) of almost 2 mL of DNA-containing saline solution into a 20 g animal. The introduced solution is close to 10% of the body weight, thus representing a rapid expansion of blood volume that cannot be immediately pumped through the vena cava of the heart. This causes sudden distension and hydrostatic pressure buildup in the surrounding tissues. A weak point is typically retrograde flow into the liver, where it has been observed that fenestrations in hepatic tissue expand to generate disruptions in cell membranes, thereby allowing influx of cargo molecules from the blood directly into the cytosol of hepatocytes 980 . High delivery efficiencies have been achieved using hydrodynamic tail vein injection, with up to 40% transfection of liver hepatocytes from a single injection 979 . Rapid intracellular delivery of other macromolecules such as labeled dyes, proteins, oligonucleotides, siRNA, bacterial artificial chromosomes, and linear or circular DNA fragments as large as 175 kb have also been delivered to rodent hepatocytes by this method, lending similar credence to a membrane permeabilization mechanism without reliance on endocytosis [980] [981] [982] [983] [984] [985] [986] [987] .",

During this hypotonic shock phase endosomes laden with cargo and osmolytes expand and rupture, thus releasing their contents. The pendulum swing from hypertonic to hypotonic conditions may also disrupt the plasma membrane, however cells are generally able to release osmolytes to counteract swelling 491 . Endosomes, on the other hand, have no volume regulation and therefore swell uncontrollably until bursting 1006, 1007 . This means the imposed hypotonic shock may impact endosomes significantly more than the plasma membrane. Okada and Rechsteiner reported that the osmotic lysis of pinosomes method was capable of introducing antibodies, various proteins, and 70 kDa labeled dextrans into the cytosol of L292, 3T3 fibroblasts, and HeLa cells 94 . It is important to note that the osmotic lysis of pinosomes method has several caveats: 1) cell stress, 2) delivery capacity is limited by extent of endocytosis, and 3) absence of reports on larger cargo such as plasmid DNA and mRNA. First, the hypertonic media imposes significant stress on cells and has been observed to actually inhibit endocytosis in some cell types 1044 . Second, the extent of endocytosis during the hypertonic exposure window is a limiting factor that affects the final concentration of cargo delivered 1044 . Multiple rounds of the procedure may be conducted to boost delivery efficiency but are time-consuming and must be balanced with considerations of cell stress 1027 . Several publications indicate that cell function and health may be compromised as a function of duration and intensity of the osmotic challenges 94,932 . The third consideration is that certain combinations of cell types and cargo molecules appear to be unfeasible with the procedure. This can be due to degradation of cargo in the acidic environment of endosomes or an unmet need for destabilizing agents to assist with endosome rupture, a role that PEG was later suggested to play 1044 .",

Instead of relying on hypotonic solutions for endosome disruption, propanebetaine appears sufficient to trigger cargo leakage specifically from macropinosomes. The method relies on NaCl-related hypertonicity of extracellular medium to induce macropinocytosis followed by spontaneous endosomal leakage. A high extracellular concentration of Na + ions was shown to be necessary to stimulate NHE1-mediated macropinocytosis. Unlike osmotic lysis of pinosomes, however, no discrete trigger was required for endosomal rupture. Instead, intracellular macropinosome leakage was a stochastic event promoted by the presence of propanebetaine or other compounds with similar physicochemical properties. The osmotic pressure created by hypertonic endosomes may also contribute to destabilize endosomes. Using iTOP, RNPs of Cas9-sgRNA were delivered into KBM7 cells and H1 human embryonic stem cells to produce CRISPR-mediated gene deletions. Various other proteins were also delivered, demonstrating efficient delivery of several cargo materials into a variety of primary cell types.",

When the potential difference reaches a critical magnitude of voltage, the probability of electroporation taking place drastically increases. According to theory, the increase in electric field energy within the membrane and ever-present thermal fluctuations combine to create and expand a heterogeneous population of pores 163,419,1051 . Although there is no fixed voltage threshold that triggers electroporation, the critical parameter of electroporation is the trans-membrane potential. This is because the maintenance of a trans-membrane electrical potential incurs a probability of generating a membrane defect for a given field strength, time, and temperature. Membrane defects originate as so-called hydrophobic pores of radius <0.5 nm, which form due to random thermal fluctuations of the individual lipid molecules that make up the membrane ( Figure 21A ). Fueled by the external electrical energy provided, these defects may then traverse their energy landscape to become hydrophilic pores, which are typically lined by at least 8 -10 phospholipid head groups and defined by their ability to permit free passage of water molecules ( Figure 21B ).",

The higher the electrical potential, the more probability of pore formation. Current theory posits that small pores are not very good conductors; hence the continued application of an electric field is not only critical for their formation, but also their enlargement 419,1051 . Pore formation and expansion are energetically favorable because it relaxes the charge buildup that would otherwise become entropically unfavorable. As the pores become better conductors, however, the electrical expanding pressure decreases, resulting in a decay in the rate of their growth. This explains two phenomena characteristic of electroporation: 1) longer pulses (usually tens of ms) are required to grow larger pores, and 2) electroporation is not very good at producing large (e.g. >50 nm) pores 579, 1052 .",

Upon application of an electric field across a lipid bilayer, an early event is tilting of the electrical dipoles associated with the lipid headgroups to align with the direction of the applied electric field 184,1053,1058 . This causes rotation of lipid molecules, thus thinning the bilayer, perturbing its organization, and facilitating the entry of water molecules into the hydrophobic core 184,1053,1058 . Pore formation follows, and the rate of transition between pore states is subject to a hysteresis where their opening (microseconds range) is thought to be much faster than the timescales of their closure (seconds to minutes) 1057 Electroporation phenomena are thought to be primarily related to changes in electrical conductance, but chemical, thermal, and electromechanical membrane deformation effects may also contribute 458, 1059 . The application of mechanical tension has been observed to lower the electric voltage threshold required for membrane disruption 1060, 1061 . This is because mechanical forces contribute to bias the energy landscape toward defect formation (see Figure 8 ). In keeping with this notion, lower temperatures have been observed to increase the field strength required for electroporation 575, 1062 and slow the kinetics of resealing 1054, 1055 . Furthermore, mathematical descriptions and models have been developed to assess, for example, the effect of applied voltage on the distribution of pore radii 420,1063 ( Figure 21C ). More recently, simulations have also assisted in illuminating the molecular events associated with electroporation, although (due to limitations in computational power) they currently only cover very short time scales on the order of nanoseconds or less 1053, 1064, 1065 . It is imperative to note, however, that many of the mathematical models and simulations are challenging to verify experimentally.",

            "text": "Therefore the amount of energy channeled into the growth of pores declines through the lifetime of a particular pulse 458 . Upon electroporation, the response within cell populations and between cell types is somewhat heterogeneous, reflecting differences in cell size, orientation, surface area, and physiological state, as well as variances in membrane composition and the presence of local inhomogeneities in the electric field itself. The microenvironment of the cell surface is characterized by the distribution of nearby or adhered macromolecules, membrane proteins, lipid phases and lateral domains, extracellular protrusions, membrane reservoirs, and underlying cytoskeletal linkages (see Figure 7B , C). It is currently not well understood how these complexities influence the generation of defect nucleation and growth under an electric field 1049 . A recent study to visualize the behaviour of membrane defects in artificial planar bilayers found that electropores form preferentially in the liquid disordered phase 1068 . This preference is also likely to be true in live cells, but lack of experimental methods to measure such phenomena has made it challenging to validate 1068 . Another mystery is the lifetimes of electropores in live cells. Once hydrophilic pores of >1 nm open up in the plasma membrane, they are thought to either spontaneously close or require active cellular processes for the bilayer to heal. For active repair processes, many researchers observe timescales of seconds to minutes 1048, 1069 . The electroporation literature, however, suggests rapid shrinkage of pores after cessation of the electric field 1070 . A memory effect, where changes in the membrane porosity remain on a longer time scale of hours has also been suggested 1069 . For further reading on the theory and mechanisms of electroporation as pertaining to live cells, we recommend other more comprehensive reviews on the topic 163,419,544,579,1048,1049,1051,1054,1055,1069-1072 .",

As discussed, there is no fixed threshold electroporation voltage because formation of electropores depends on a combination of voltage strength, pulse duration, number of pulses, pulse waveform, temperature, buffer conductivity, and cell properties 1048, 1049 . This large variable space presents a challenge in optimizing electroporation. All other variables being held constant, most approaches focus on tuning the \"pulse strengthduration space\" 579 1073 . Specifically, human eosinophils were exposed to a field strength of 53 kV cm -1 applied in a train of 5 pulses of 60 nanoseconds each. In response, the cells formed intracellular granules even without extensive plasma membrane permeabilization. Follow up studies by the same group indicated these nanosecond pulses induced apoptosis, as signified by exposure of annexin-V at the cell surface and the absence of ethidium homodimer fluorescence 1074 . Further hallmarks of apoptosis were observed with fluorescent probes that report on caspase activation and the release of mitochondria-associated protein cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. It is thought that apoptosis occurs due to a release of cytotoxic factors from permeabilized mitochondria and breakdown of intracellular calcium stores. It was therefore concluded that apoptosis triggered by nanosecond pulsed electroporation can occur in the absence of disruption to the plasma membrane. This is of widespread interest for two reasons: 1) the targeted induction of apoptosis by ultrashort electrical pulses could avoid the immune response associated with lysing or necrotic cells 1075 . 2) For intracellular delivery applications it is an effect that should be avoided to maintain cell survival. Unwanted disruption of intracellular organelles could explain observations of delayed cell death that sometimes occur after high field strength electroporation.",

Short pulses in the microsecond to millisecond range result in numerous, but smaller sized pores distributed evenly over the poles of the plasma membrane and sometimes nucleus 579 . The longer pulse space >0.1 ms is limited to lower voltages; otherwise Joule heating becomes a problem for treated cells, a factor also dependent on conductivity of the medium. Because voltages must be lower in this regime, the dependence on size of the membrane-bound body biases poration towards larger objects at their poles, therefore favoring plasma membrane disruption of larger cells (>tens of micron diameter) 579 . At these longer durations the membranes of larger cells such as skeletal muscle and nerve cells are much more responsive to electroporation. Taken together, data compiled from multiple reports suggest that manipulation of the pulse strength-duration parameter space is able to mediate a significant measure of control over the subcellular localization and distribution of membrane disruptions generated in cells (Figure 23 ).",

For example, the imposed electric field might augment macromolecule delivery through electrophoretic or electro-osmotic effects 1123, 1127, 1128 . The models based on electrophoresis, however, have not addressed how they would be relevant to uncharged molecules. The electro-osmotic explanation, on the other hand, proposes that the application of an electric field causes a convective flow of electrolytes and osmotically obliged solution that sweeps the cargo molecules along with it. Although discussed in some papers, the few studies that have sought to investigate electro-osmotic contributions to molecular delivery in live cells are inconclusive 1123, 1127 Another idea is that electroporation-stimulated endocytosis via macropinocytosis may contribute to protein uptake in the minutes following electric field exposure 1130 . Strong electroporation treatments have sometimes been reported to cause proteins and dextrans to become aggregated or trapped at the plasma membrane 1092, 1122 . Such membrane-bound proteins can be removed with the protease trypsin while dextrans could not, demonstrating that proteins were stuck to the cell surface and not inside the cell 1122 . If electroporation causes cargo to aggregate at the cell surface, this would make it amenable for uptake by endocytosis 1130 . The degree to which this occurs for different cargo molecules, however, has not been thoroughly investigated.",

Some of the plasmids eventually arrive at the nucleus over a timecourse of ~2 hours or longer 1132 . Collectively, these results led to the emergence of an endocytic model of plasmid electrotransfer that has gained significant attention (Figure 25) . As membrane remodeling via endocytosis is a core pathway used by cells to repair their membranes 447,455 , endocytic uptake could be an active cellular response to the perturbation caused by DNA entanglement in the membrane, as earlier predicted by Tsong and colleagues 1070 . Subsequent studies have shown that, in CHO cells for example, ~50% of DNA is internalized by caveolin/raft-mediated endocytosis, ~25% by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and ~25% by macropinocytosis 1138 . Within 2 hours, more than half of the DNA ends up in lysosomes, as revealed by co-localization with the lysosomal marker LAMP1 1138 . Furthermore, single-particle tracking experiments of fluorescently labeled plasmids indicate that cytoskeletal processes, involving both actin and microtubule networks, are involved in trafficking of DNA-associated endosomes toward the cell nucleus [1138] [1139] [1140] . It is important to recognize, however, that many of the basic mechanisms of the plasmid trafficking from the membrane to the nucleus remain underexplored and poorly defined 1131, 1132 .",

            "text": "Electroporation-mediated delivery of oligonucleotides and siRNA is similar to the case of DNA in that it also relies on electrophoretic forces 163 . A key distinction, however, is that siRNA undergoes direct delivery into the cytoplasm without relying on endocytosis ( Figure 24D ). This is by virtue of its smaller dimensions (2 x 7.5 nm) 219 compared to DNA plasmids(~100 -200 nm) 206 (see Table 1 ). Imaging of fluorescently labeled siRNA has shown that it enters during application of the electric field at the side of the cell facing the cathode and disperses throughout the cytosol within tens of seconds 1144 . siRNA influx was reported not to occur after cessation of applied voltage, indicating that electrophoretic forces are probably required for delivery 1144 . For short (10 ns) pulses applied to GUVs, influx of siRNA also relied on electrophoretic drive and some siRNA remains trapped in the bilayer at the end of the electric pulse 1145 . However, electrophoretic driving forces might only be necessary for delivery through small pores of <10 nm where there is a Born energy barrier 163 . Such a scenario is analogous to that discussed for small charged molecules ( Figure 24C ). It is likely that transient large pores (>10 nm) can facilitate entry of siRNA via free diffusion, since siRNA knockdown has been observed with membrane disruption-based methods that lack electrophoretic forces, including with pore-forming toxins 238 , microfluidic cell squeezing 108,780 , and laser-nucleated cavitation bubbles 923 . Therefore, one can speculate that siRNA delivery is mediated by a combination of electrophoretic and/or diffusive mechanisms depending on the size and lifetime of the pores.",

For dmolecule << ddisruption both neutral and charged molecules should diffuse across their concentration gradient whilever the pore is large enough. Although the majority of delivery is via diffusion, electrophoretic or electro-osmotic phenomena may assist translocation during the pulse. For dmolecule \u2248 ddisruption charge will play a critical role. Neutral molecules may diffuse through pores while their charged counterparts will face the Born's energy barrier, only being able to translocate while driven by sufficient electrophoretic forces. For the case of dmolecule >> ddisruption only molecules that are both conformationally flexible and significantly charged will have a chance of penetrating. As exemplified by the case of DNA plasmids, parts of the molecule may be threaded into pores and therefore become embedded in the membrane. This makes the molecule available to be taken up via endocytosis, a result that may or may not be desirable for a given application. ",

In more complicated cases, however, involving charged molecules close to or larger than the pore size (Figure 26 ), the efficiency of delivery depends critically on magnitude and duration of electrophoretic forces 469, 531, 532, 1113, 1135 . Regarding plasmid delivery, for example, longer pulse durations are often found to heavily improve transfection efficiency. Yet longer pulses can bring the problem of Joule heating and excessive cell damage 1146 . One strategy to mitigate Joule heating is the use of low conductivity buffers that have lower electrolyte concentrations than standard physiological buffers or media. The osmolarity of the buffer will have an effect as well, because it can alter the size of the cell, tension on the plasma membrane, conformation of membrane reservoirs, and the interaction between cargo molecules and the cell surface 1049 . Temperature will also affect the properties of the membrane and energy barriers for electroporation, as well as the active cell response and membrane repair dynamics 1049 .",

The rationale behind this dual pulse strategy is that the first pulse is thought to nucleate many pores over a large segment of the cell surface, while the second pulse should simultaneously grow the pores and electrophoretically propel charged molecules into the cell. Indeed, several studies have confirmed that the duration of the second low-voltage pulse correlates with DNA transfection efficiency 531,532,1135 .",

The high conductivity of nucleofection buffers (ionic strength >200 mM) is thought not to cause Joule heating problems due to the emphasis on small volumes and shorter pulse durations 550, 1157 .

A number of factors lend credence to the endocytic explanation. First, the cytoplasm is a highly crowded and viscous environment laced with cytoskeletal filaments and organelles. The mobility of microinjected plasmid DNA is extremely small or even negligible in the cytoplasm or cell nucleus [1160] [1161] [1162] . To be electrophoretically propelled through the cytoplasm into the nucleus, a combination of significant plasmid compaction and large electrophoretic forces would potentially be required, although this has not been directly proven 1132 . Second, the reported timing of gene expression is in the range of 6 hours after treatment 1156, 1159 , which is actually longer than achieved with standard electroporation that relies on endocytosis 1132 . In contrast, microinjection of DNA directly into the nucleus can mediate gene expression within 30 minutes. Some authors have speculated whether nucleofection permeabilizes the nucleus with its first high-voltage pulse, thus assisting in nuclear delivery 105, 579, 1157 . This hypothesis has not been rigorously tested in experiments to date.",

            "text": "When electric current passes through an aqueous solution, it triggers temperature increase (Joule heating) concurrent with various chemical reactions at the solution-electrode interface (electrolysis). Electrolysis itself produces changes in the temperature, pH, and the chemical composition of the adjacent solution. The degree of Joule heating is influenced by the conductivity of the buffer, electrode architecture, electric field parameters, and capacity of the system for dissipation. For cuvette style setups, temperature spikes of more than 30 K above ambient conditions have been measured in physiological saline at millisecond pulse durations 1146 . Such observations have led some researchers in the field to assert that Joule heating is a significant problem 579 . For example, an 8 kV cm -1 pulse of 100 \u03bcs has been calculated to lead to a temperature increase from 23 \u00b0C to 42 \u00b0C in PBS solution 579 . Lipid membranes and proteins are destabilized by temperatures above 42 \u00b0C 1176 . Therefore, Joule heating is not just an issue for the plasma membrane, but also for intracellular membranes and proteins throughout the cell. To mitigate the negative effects of Joule heating, electroporation procedures can be performed at room temperature (20-25 \u00b0C) or on ice (0-4 \u00b0C). Lower temperatures, however, makes cells more resistant to pore formation 574,575 , thereby reducing delivery efficiency. Another approach to combat Joule heating is to use lowconductivity buffers, which feature lower concentrations of electrolytes and instead maintain osmolarity by inclusion of organic osmolytes or sugars like sucrose and mannitol 532 . Low-conductivity buffers reduce Joule heating while enabling the long pulses that are preferred for some protocols, such as for DNA transfection.",

For large surface area electrodes, such as cuvette style electroporation chambers, the most commonly used materials are aluminium, copper, and stainless steel. Analysis of stainless steel and aluminium electrodes found that, after a train of pulses similar to a standard electroporation protocol, metal ions were found in solution at up to milliMolar concentrations 574, 1178, 1180, 1181 . Aluminium ions and aluminium hydroxides can wreak havoc on cellular processes, such as inositol phosphate activity 574, 1177 . Moreover, Stapulionis et al. found that released copper, iron, and aluminium ions can interact with nucleic acids and cause their precipitation out of solution 1178 . Other studies have found Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ to be toxic to in vitro cell cultures at milliMolar concentrations 1180 . Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ released from the anode behave as Lewis acids and hydrolyze the water molecules in the solution. This effect can reduce pH and potentially alter the medium conductivity 1181 .",

For example, the application of strong electric fields to cells has been suggested to trigger lipid peroxidation [1190] [1191] [1192] , generation of reactive oxygen species 1193,1194 , protein denaturation, and DNA damage 1195, 1196 amongst other responses. Under electroporation conditions compatible with cell survival, it was shown that electroporation can trigger an \"oxidative jump\" where the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) rises sharply 1193 . The measured generation of ROS was to some extent dependent on extracellular calcium and magnesium but could be prevented by addition of anti-oxidants. In subsequent studies, lipid peroxidation, as evidenced by the presence of lipid hydroperoxides, was observed in the membranes of both plant and animal cells following electroporation 1191, 1192 . Further investigations using the chemiluminescent probe lucigenin found that CHO cells subject to millisecond pulses undergo a threshold level of oxidation of their plasma membrane lipids, but that this effect only partially correlates with cell survival 1194 . Interestingly, lipid peroxidation of unsaturated phosphatidyl choline species has also been observed during electroformation of giant unilamellar vesicles 1197 . Membranes characterized by a high degree of peroxidized lipids tend to be weaker and more susceptible to disruption, including by electroporation 1198 . Indeed, lipid peroxidation is well known to influence membrane behaviour, including domain formation and mechanical properties, which could have implications for cell recovery post-electroporation.",

DNA damage in proportion to the applied voltage and duration has been reported in HL60 cells, although no specific mechanisms were pinpointed 1196 . It could be that DNA damage is due to influx of oxidative agents from the extracellular environment. Regarding proteins, Chen and colleagues have suggested non-thermal electroconformational damage to ion channels following exposure to strong electric fields [1199] [1200] [1201] [1202] . More general models describing electroconformational damage of membrane proteins and other cellular components have subsequently been described 1203, 1204 . In particular, it is proposed that charged amino acids in membrane proteins or voltage-sensing segments in voltage-dependent transporters are vulnerable to sharp changes in electrical potential. These effects are thought to be more pronounced for shorter pulses of higher amplitude 1205 . Indeed, other studies showed that high voltage nanosecond pulses are likely to perturb the function of voltage-gated channel proteins 1206 , and possibly other proteins in general 1207 .",

Electric pulse-induced precipitation of nucleic acids and other biological macromolecules has also been observed under certain conditions 1178, 1216 , although it is unclear why other groups haven't seen such problems. These studies noted that nucleic acids aggregated into a non-functional state under the conditions of their experiment.

Subsequently, the first commercial electroporator, the BioRad Gene Pulser, was launched with this configuration in the mid 1980s. Since then, the cuvette geometry has become the standard platform for electroporation, being simple, robust, and reasonably well understood ( Figure 28A(i) ). The nucleofector is no exception, and as discussed previously, its novelty arises not through a deviation from this geometry, but rather from the systematic use of optimized pulsing protocols and cell type-specific buffers. Despite its widespread adoption, the cuvette style geometry is not without problems. As discussed above, the large surface area of the metal electrodes presents issues concerning electrolysis, such as Joule heating, corrosion, pH deviations, and inconsistent field profile. Second, cuvette style electroporation is difficult to perform with low volumes (<20 \u03bcl). As the intracellular delivery of a molecule via permeabilization is directly related to extracellular concentration, it is often advantageous to concentrate the cells into a minimal volume in the range of 10 \u03bcl or less. This maximizes the concentration, which is especially useful for expensive or precious reagents. Below we discuss the innovations that have been produced in the electroporation field, including difference setups for bulk, micro-and nano-electroporation.",

This design was introduced by a company called NanoEntek in Korea and subsequently commercialized by Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher as the \"Neon\" electroporation system 558 . In the Neon system, cells and buffer solution are pipetted into a narrow capillary (0.56 mm wide and 30 mm long) featuring a wire gold electrode with minimal surface area at the top. The other electrode, also made of gold, is located within a conductive electrolyte bath outside the capillary. Because of the small surface area and distance from the cells, bubbles, Joule heating, and pH waves are more effectively separated from the cells. The small size of the electrodes also means that gold plating becomes economical. Chemical stability of the electrodes is superior to those made from less inert metals like iron, aluminium, or copper. The inventors compared pH deviations in the capillary system to those of conventional cuvette style chambers and it appeared to confer substantial advantages in protecting cells from the toxic electrolytic processes that can occur at electrodes. Together these features are purported to increase the viability of cells treated in capillary electroporation system 558 .",

The pulse duration is limited in the range 1-100 ms and voltage from 500-2000 V. Given the distance of the conductive path between the electrodes, this means the field strength does not exceed 1 kV cm -1 . The user may increase the number of pulses but there is no option to program pulses of different voltage, or frequency. Thus, the dual pulse strategies that have become so popular with the Nucleofector system are not possible with the Neon platform. High cost of capillary tips, electrodes, and buffers is another factor that users dislike 559 . In response to this, some researchers have published protocols advising users on how to recycle the components and employ homemade buffers, such as one consisting of PBS supplemented with 250 mM sucrose and 1 mM MgCl2 559 .",

Electroporation combined with microfabricated, microfluidic, and nanotechnology concepts has received a great deal of attention in the last two decades as evidenced by a spate of reviews on the topic [1217] [1218] [1219] [1220] [1221] [1222] . Compared to bulk electroporation systems, it has been argued that micro-and nano-electroporation can provide the following advantages 1220,1221 : 1) lower voltages due to smaller scale, thus obviating the need for high powered pulse generators, 2) ability to concentrate, trap, and position cells and cargoes for higher efficiency delivery, 3) real time monitoring of device performance at single cell level, and 4) scalable solutions from single cells up to large populations. One of the first microfluidic electroporation systems was constructed by Huang and Rubinsky in the late 1990s 1223 . It was essentially a small hole of 2 -10 \u03bcm diameter that a single cell could be sucked onto. The application of an electric pulse from below was used to permeabilize the basal side of the trapped cell and study the mechanisms of electroporation at single cell level. Although only demonstrated as a proof of concept, such developments spurred the field on toward further efforts. Several years later the first microfluidic flow electroporation devices appeared on the scene. Huang and Rubinsky were again pioneers in this department, demonstrating loading of small molecule dyes and transfection with GFPencoding plasmids, albeit at low throughput 1224 Figure 28B(i) ). The cell is then permeabilized to the molecular cargo loaded within the droplet. In this case a DNA plasmid encoding for GFP was successfully delivered into CHO cells 1226 . The pulse parameters were governed by the flow speed, size of the droplet, distance between the electrode pair, and the positioning of the cell inside the droplet. Owing to the rise in droplet-based microfluidics for high-throughput single-cell manipulation, techniques that can perform intracellular delivery on cells within droplets are expected to be important.",

By scaling the aperture size down to ~90 nm, the membrane disruption effect of electroporation could be concentrated onto a very small spot on the cell surface ( Figure 28C (i)). A significant claim of this strategy is dose control, i.e. the finding that the amount of delivered material directly correlates with the voltage pulse duration. Nanochannel electroporation also appears to introduce agents faster and deeper into the cytoplasm, a result attributed to enhanced and concentrated electrophoretic forces. In support of this, finite element simulations found that fringe fields extend into the cell and could possibly be used to propel molecular cargo through the permeabilized section of the cell periphery and deep into the cytoplasm. Compared to conventional electroporation and other forms of microfluidic electroporation, it was proposed that nanochannel delivery mechanism is based on electrophoretic forces rather than diffusion and/or endocytosis. Nanochannel electroporation was able to deliver dyes, oligonucleotides, siRNA, plasmids and quantum dots into recipient cells. Moreover, only nanochannel electroporation could deliver quantum dots into Jurkat cells, while conventional or microfluidic electroporation could not. One drawback of the method, however, was the low throughput nature of the technique. Prior to electroporation each single cell requires placement against the nanochannel with optical tweezers.",

Furthermore, with sufficient adhesion to the nanostraw array, substantial pumping forces can presumably be used to flow molecules into the cell cytoplasm without cell detachment.

Yet the technical advancements of miniaturized approaches have not translated to widespread adoption, most likely due to high cost, impractical throughput, lack of focus on clinical or industrially relevant problems, or lack of userfriendly designs 1221 . Thus, it remains to be seen what the next generation electroporation systems will look like, and whether they will challenge the dominance of existing methods. Apart from technical upgrades, recent literature emphasizes that further theoretical studies on mechanisms of cell membrane permeabilization and cargo uptake are needed to obtain further progress in the field 163,1118,1131,1132,1138,1144,1219 .",

In keeping with the focus of this review, we will focus our discussion on the in vitro and ex vivo applications relevant to intracellular delivery in human and animal cells. Within this context, electroporation has been employed mainly for nucleic acid transfection, of which there are three main market areas: 1) biomedical research, 2) biomanufacture of biologics (proteins, antibodies, and viral vectors/particles), and 3) therapeutics (cell-based therapies, gene therapy, and cell manipulation for regenerative medicine)(see Figure 3 ).

Using radiolabeled tracers, they found electroporation rendered cells permeable to small molecules for up to 10 minutes. Subsequently, electroporation has been used to screen for cytotoxicity of drugs that are otherwise susceptible to be pumped out of cells by the activity of cellular efflux pumps 55, 1086 . Bleomycin (~1.4 kDa) represents a particularly striking example of a drug where activity is drastically increased with electroporation-mediated intracellular delivery 55, 1086 .

Significant efforts have gone into engineering these systems for maximum yield and economies of scale.

In the last few years RNP delivery has been successfully accomplished with Table 1 ). The mechanisms of electroporation-mediated delivery could thus be similar to siRNA, namely direct translocation of a highly negatively charged molecule into the cytoplasm at the side of the cell facing the negative electrode during the pulse ( Figure 24D ). Once in the cytoplasm a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) on the Cas9 would then promote its shuttling to the nucleus. Another possibility is that RNPs are endocytosed after being entangled in the destabilized plasma membrane, such as is the case for plasmid DNA ( Figure 24E, Figure 25 ). Indeed, post-electroporation aggregation or trapping of proteins at the plasma membrane has been observed in several cases 1092, 1122 . The groundbreaking potential of genome editing will no doubt stimulate the field toward studying mechanisms of protein and RNP delivery to the nucleus. For example, the optimal nuclear concentrations of Cas9 RNP needed for efficient genome editing are still unknown. In future, it will also be interesting to see how other membrane disruption-based delivery approaches (which do not supply electrophoretic forces) compare in their efficiencies of RNP delivery. Together these studies suggest that no one electroporation system has a monopoly on effectiveness with sensitive or difficult to treat cell types.",

In experiments on mammalian cells, Bischof et al. exposed fibroblasts and muscle cells to temperatures ranging from 37 to 70 \u00b0C and monitored membrane integrity in real time. Permeability was assessed by tracking the leakage of calcein (0.62 kDa) with timelapse fluorescence microscopy. Slow leakage, which starts above 40 \u00b0C, was found to be a function of both temperature and time. Cells held at 45 \u00b0C were completely depleted of calcein within 25 minutes. This corroborates well with other data indicating cells must work harder to maintain their relatively high potassium concentrations during treatments at 43 \u00b0C 1313 .",

Above 55 \u00b0C, almost 50% of calcein leaks out of the cell within one minute and efflux is fully complete by 2 minutes. To explain the increase in permeability, contributions from both protein denaturation and increased kinetic diffusion of lipid molecules were suggested. Other studies in red blood cells indicate that thermally-induced membrane disruption occurs at about 60 \u00b0C and protein denaturation temperature depends on the specific protein 1314, 1315 . Interestingly, addition of poloxamers, which are both membrane-healing and anti-oxidant 459 , are able to rescue viability of thermally challenged cells 1316 . This indicates that loss of membrane integrity is a key aspect of immediate cell toxicity upon heating 1316 . For intracellular delivery purposes, supraphysiological temperatures have rarely been employed ( Figure 30B ), probably due to concerns of non-specific cell damage and toxicity as exemplified by the trehalose experiments discussed above 75 . Baseline temperature is a critical parameter for any delivery protocol, however, and there have been a few rare reports of supraphysiological regimes. For example, 43 \u00b0C was found employed in one study to make cell membranes more susceptible to fluid shear from laserinduced stress waves 1317 .",

Possibilities include burning/evaporation, thermoelastic mechanical stress, generation of low-density free-electron plasma and reactive oxygen specifies (ROS), and effects beyond the focal region, such as shock wave emission and growth/collapse of cavitation bubbles, which themselves produce fluid shear stress, extreme heat, and sonochemical phenomena [1321] [1322] [1323] 1331 (Figure 31 ). The relative dominance of these phenomena depends on factors such as wavelength, frequency, whether the source is continuous wave or pulsed, laser power, exposure time, spot size, and absorbance properties of focal region. For example, membrane wounding from continuous wave irradiation is thought to arise primarily from local heating, which intensifies as a function of exposure time. Nanosecond pulsed lasers have been suggested to produce a combination of heating, bubble formation, and thermoelastic or di-electric mechanical stresses to damage the membrane. Femtosecond laser mechanisms appear tunable based on irradiance strength, pulse duration, and frequency. Mechanisms range from almost purely chemical degradation to combinations of thermal and mechanical. In cases where laser energy is transduced into fluid shear that travels far beyond the focal region, such as cavitation or shock waves, the mechanisms of membrane damage are not strictly optoporation and these scenarios are covered elsewhere in the section on fluid shear (section 6.1.2). Alternatively, if transmission of thermal energy from an absorbing object in immediate contact is the mechanism of membrane disruption, these accounts are covered in the thermal section (section 6.3).",

            "text": "Most recent work favors the use of a laser regime characterized by wavelengths >700 nm administered at high frequencies (~MHz range) and femtosecond pulse timings with a cumulative exposure of milliseconds or less 1321 . For example, a typical protocol might involve 5 ms of exposure to a cycle of 100 fs pulses with gaps of 10 ns (~100 MHz frequency) for cooldown. When operating at wavelengths >700 nm the mechanisms are related to multi-photon effects inherently concentrated within the focal region, thus offering increased precision and high spatial resolution 1321 . NIR and IR wavelengths also have the advantage of being less toxic to cells, as UV and blue light in particular are notorious for causing damage to DNA and other cellular structures. By using extremely short femtosecond pulses, absorbing material in focal region does not have sufficient time to transmit heat to adjacent regions. This enables extremely high-powered lasers to be deployed while avoiding excessive heating of cells. In such a scenario the resultant membrane disruption mechanisms have been reported to be due to chemical effects, such as the breakdown of bonds in lipid tails by low-energy plasma [1321] [1322] [1323] 1331 ( Figure 31C ). In other cases, femtosecond pulsing generates a well-controlled cavitation bubble originating within the focal region, the presence of which can destroy the membrane ( Figure 31B ). In many of these studies, distinctions between exact mechanisms are difficult to determine, and could be multifactorial. A number of elegant studies have been performed with femtosecond pulsed lasers. For example, in optical setups that combine laser tweezing and optoporation, optical tweezers may be used to guide a microbead (~1 \u03bcm) or nanoparticle through a hole formed by the laser, thus delivering large cargo 1369, 1371 . In studies with frog embryos quantum dots were delivered by NIR femtosecond lasers. Neither the quantum dots nor optoporation retarded the ability of these embryos to grow into tadpoles. In another case, cargo was introduced into distinct regions of adherent primary rat neurons to assess localization-dependent biological functions 252 . mRNA-mediated expression of the transcription factor Elk-1 was found to produce different responses whether delivered to the soma or axon of the neurons 252 . This optoporation protocol involved an 840 nm titanium-sapphire laser delivering 100 fs pulses at a repetition rate of 80 MHz for 1 -5 ms at a power of 30 mW 252 . Other studies have quantitatively measured the loading efficiency of femtosecond optoporation, and found that targeted cells can incorporate up to 40% of the concentration of extracellular molecules before resealing 483 . Furthermore, sub-20 femtosecond pulses at MHz frequencies with sub-millisecond exposure times have been demonstrated for the effective transfection of human primary pancreatic and salivary gland stem cells 1348 .",

In agreement with experimental data, DMSO molecules are seen to penetrate into the bilayer, both expanding the distance between the lipids and reducing the thickness of the bilayer ( Figure 32A) . Consequently, the lipid-water interface becomes more prone to structural defects, especially due to thermal fluctuations. At higher DMSO concentrations, water molecules enter the membrane interior via DMSOmediated structural defects. As the number of penetrating water molecules increases, a significant re-orientation of lipid headgroups toward the membrane interior is required to minimize the free-energy of the system, resulting in the formation of hydrophilic channels spanning the membrane bilayer 410 . The emergence of hydrophilic channels occurs spontaneously between 10-20% molar concentration of DMSO 1378 .

Most detergents are coneshaped, in that the head group of the detergent is disproportionately larger than the hydrophobic chains. They generally work by inserting into lipid bilayers and distorting their structure. Several mechanisms have been suggested for detergentmediated permeabilization of lipid bilayers depending on the type of detergent 441 . Those capable of flip-flopping to the inner leaflet will distribute throughout both leaflets of the bilayer (Figure 33) . Because of the cone-shaped nature of detergents, the structure of the monolayer wants to assume a degree of convex intrinsic curvature. However, this is impossible if the monolayer is part of a bilayer, because it competes with the opposite spontaneous curvature of the other leaflet since are coupled with each other. Instead, the monolayers are 'bent straight' by an elastic deformation giving rise to a monolayer curvature strain. The major structural consequence of this curvature strain is a disordering of the hydrophobic chains. In turn, the membrane becomes thinner and more flexible. Monolayer curvature strain can be partially relaxed by the sequestering of surfactants into highly curved rims covering the hydrophobic edges of toroidal pores 441 . Over time, thermal fluctuations will give rise to such events. Moreover, reduction of the pore's line tension by detergents may massively increase the lifetimes of induced pores or even stabilize them indefinitely. Above a critical surfactant concentration, pores appear spontaneously so that permeabilization becomes effectively persistent 441 . ",

There is little theory to support this third possibility, however it should be mentioned as a possibility. In order to first achieve micelles, the detergent will need to be at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration (CMC). This will only be a realistic scenario in the case of detergents that don't readily embed into cell membranes. Thus, integration of individual detergent molecules into the target membrane may not be necessary to cause defect generation and subsequent permeabilization. ",

Indeed, strongly curvature-inducing detergents are known to be far more effective in membrane permeabilization 441 .

In contrast, the hetergenous category included the fungicidal lipopeptides surfactin, fengycin, and iturin, as well as digitonin, CHAPS, and lysophosphatidylcholine, which perturb membranes without substantial overall disordering. Rather, they disrupt membranes locally in surfactant-rich defect structures.

In this case the efficiency of their membrane perturbing effects are directly correlated with sterol content.

Hence, saponins can be been exploited to target the plasma membrane while leaving those of cholesterol-poor organelles, such as the ER and mitochondria, largely unaffected 397, 585, 1405 .

            "text": "How do saponins interact with cholesterol to disrupt membranes? Frenkel et al. conducted investigations into the mechanism using quantitative physical techniques in model membranes. Their measurements indicate that digitonin extracts cholesterol out of the bilayer core to form a surface complex, which then induces curvature and disordering of the membrane 1406 . The magnitude of these effects was directly proportional to the amount of cholesterol in the bilayer ( Figure   36 ). At 0% cholesterol, digitonin could not bind to the membrane and thus had no effect. At 5% cholesterol, exposure to digitonin triggered the formation of sterol-aglycone complexes without significant membrane distortion. At 20% cholesterol, digitonin extracts cholesterol into aggregates, thus removing it from the hydrophobic core region. The steric hindrance between saccharide residues in these aggregates may induce changes in the curvature of the membrane outer leaflet leading to compromisation of the membrane integrity and concomitant increase in membrane permeability 1406 . In essence, digitonin binds to cholesterol and transforms it into a detergent.",

            "text": "Beyond digitonin, studies have explored a wider range of individual saponins for membrane permeabilization. Recently a set of oleanane saponins (glycyrrhizic acid, Gypsophila, Saponaria and Quillaja saponins) and digitonin were tested in live cells. These saponins showed variable permeabilizing effects on cellular membranes from 6 \u03bcM, as measured by an impedance-based plate reader with ECV-304 human urinary bladder carcinoma cells 1407 . The results indicated that the molecular charge may be a relevant consideration in explaining the action of oleanane saponins. Further studies on \u03b1hederin indicate that the critical micelle concentration (CMC) plays a key role in its mechanism. At concentrations lower than the CMC, \u03b1-hederin monomers bind to cholesterol and induce vesiculation and lateral phase separation 1408, 1409 . These effects are analogous to the action of detergents that do not flip flop, as depicted in figure 34 . At concentrations higher than the CMC, \u03b1-hederin aggregates promote pore formation and the loss of membrane material by analogy to the scenario illustrated in figure 35 . Thus, the self-aggregating properties and co-operative action of saponins may also be important for their effects. Most studies agree that the permeabilizing activity of saponins rely on the presence of sterols, from which they forms complexes to distort the membrane into non-bilayer structures. As an exception to this rule, some bidesmosidic saponins, such as avicin D 1410 , appear capable of porating cell membranes through detergent properties independent of cholesterol binding 1393 . ",

The emergence of saponins for the production of semi-intact cells began around the early 1980s. In 1982 Wakasugi et al. used saponin or digitonin in the range 20 -100 \u03bcg ml -1 (~16 -80 \u03bcM) to permeabilize acini from rat pancreases and probe the effect of ATP on intracellular calcium dynamics 1411 . A year later, the plasma membranes of isolated guinea pig hepatocytes were made permeable with 75 \u03bcg ml -1 (~60 \u03bcM) saponin to study the ATP-dependent uptake of calcium into the endoplasmic reticulum 583 . Upon saponin treatment, cells were suspended in a medium resembling cytosol with an ATP-regenerating system consisting of ATP, creatine phosphate, and creatine phosphokinase. Dunn and Holz used 20 \u03bcM digitonin to permeabilize chromaffin cells, and this protocol became a popular system to study intracellular processes in this cell type 584, 1412 . Human platelets were also treated with saponins for the loading of the secondary messenger inositol 1,4,5trisphosphate into the cytoplasm and studying of the metabolic signaling response 1413 . Several groups reported that with optimal conditions, 50% or more of the cytoplasmic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (~140 kDa) is able to remain inside cells for extended periods, indicating the possibility of maintaining a feasible balance between plasma membrane permeabilization and cell function in these experiments 584, 585, 1414 . In most of these papers the plasma membrane resealing dynamics were not discussed. Thus, it is difficult to ascertain whether or not the cells were persistently permeabilized or whether they recovered due to plasma membrane repair.",

Molecules are added indiscriminately to solution, and it is difficult to get rid of them once then job is done. Thus, it is difficult to balance the required level of membrane permeabilization against excessive toxicity ( Figure 37A ). Recently, Kilinc et al. used microfluidics to demonstrate controlled flux of localized saponins to perform precise axotomy (cut off an axon) on neurons cultured on microchips 1426 . In a variation on this theme, the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was employed in laminar flow mode in a microfluidic device to damage specific sections of neurites and investigate the recovery process 1427 . Saponin has also been combined with nanostraws to localize membrane disruption to the nanostraw openings 701 . These examples showcase the potential of nano and microfluidic systems to localize and control damage conferred by detergents to subcellular regions ( Figure 37B ). It remains to be seen whether such strategies can be feasible for intracellular delivery at high throughput, although we anticipate that inventors will test this possibility in the near future.",

To date, more than 5,000 of them have been catalogued 1438, 1439 , with frog skin alone representing a source of more than 300 variants 1440 . Only a small selection of AMPs have been studied for their molecular mechanisms of action. A common feature is their ability to adopt a conformation with hydrophobic segments distinct from hydrophilic/cationic segments 1429 . For a given AMP, the ability to disrupt membranes also depends on the lipid composition of the target membrane. In contrast to the plasma membrane of animal cells, most microbial membranes, including those of gram-positive (monoderm) and gram-negative (diderm) bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, feature many negatively charged lipid headgroups on their outer leaflets 1441 . This allows a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions to drive adsorption of cationic AMPs to the surface of microbes with high affinity 1429 . Once at the interface, hydrophobic segments integrate into the membrane to disrupt it, with several different models proposed for how they generate pores 440, 1430, 1442 . Due to the higher affinity for microbial membranes, AMPs can lyse microbes at \u03bcM concentrations while having less effect on animal cell membranes. This enables them to kill microorganisms without being significantly toxic to mammalian cells. Moreover, in an opposite manner to saponins, cholesterol in the plasma membrane of animal cells serves to suppress the activity of AMPs due to its stabilizing effect. At high enough concentrations, however, AMPs will disrupt plasma membranes of mammalian cells, and this is the regime of interest for potential intracellular delivery applications.",

Amino-terminal residues 1-20 are mostly hydrophobic while carboxyl-terminal residues 21-26 are hydrophilic due to a string of positive charges. Pores produced by melittin exposure have been estimated at 2.5 -3 nm in palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) vesicles 1445 . Experiments with GUVs held by micropipettes revealed that melittin first increases the membrane surface area due to adsorption/integration before rearranging to induce stable pores without vesicle rupture 1446 . Later studies showed that melittin partitions to both sides of the bilayer, probably via transient defects, before finally reaching a concentration where stable pore formation occurs. The critical concentration lies in the \u03bcM range and corresponds to a peptide-to-lipid ratio of 1:100 or greater 1447 .",

The pores are thought to be \"chaotic\", lined by a mixture of peptides and lipids acting in cooperation, rather than a well-defined peptide lined channel 1450 . In keeping with the notion of a two-state model, the human LL37 peptide has been observed to first absorb parallel to the surface as an alpha-helix before inserting and rotating normal to the membrane to form pores with an estimated diameter of 2.3 -3.3 nm 1451 . AMPs can to some extent exhibit detergent-like effects including membrane thinning, bilayer stresses, toroidal pore formation, micellization 1452 . Unlike detergents, however, they tend not to dissolve the membrane structure but rather induce smaller pores for the passage of low-molecular weight molecules 1447 .

The depictions of these pore models are shown in Figure highly localized electric field, which could destabilize the bilayer by an electroporation-like effect [1455] [1456] [1457] . Interestingly, simulations indicate that the emerging defects appear to exhibit a significantly disordered shape, rather than a classic toroidal pore 1454 . Studies of magainin MG-H2 peptide reveal that its binding creates a local tension in the exposed leaflet, which creates a compressive stress that is relieved upon pore formation 1458 Possible thermodynamic states (either stable or metastable) are indicated by black labels and the major kinetic pathways connecting them by gray arrows and red labels. Short black arrows represent additional inter-conversion pathways. Outside the target membrane, peptide monomers and small aggregates exist in equilibrium. At the target membrane, the peptides bind to the interface (Adsorption). At the interface an equilibrium may exist between monomeric and polymeric aggregation states. For a symmetric bilayer, the asymmetric membrane bound state is not thermodynamically stable. Eventually the peptides will distribute equally between the two monolayer leaflets. This can occur via two alternative translocation pathways. In the non-leaky variant the peptides are able to cross the bilayer without the formation of a pore. In some cases, the intermediate transmembrane state is thermodynamically stable (e.g. hydrophobic peptides which adopt a transmembrane orientation). The key feature of many antimicrobial peptides is that they permeabilize the membrane following a leaky translocation pathway. Above a certain peptidelipid ratio, the peptides insert into the bilayer to form a porated lamellar phase (poration). A variety of different pore structures may be formed, including the barrel-stave, the toroidal and the disordered toroidal state. These separate states should be interpreted as extreme cases with mixed varieties of these models, and conversion between alternative states is likely to occur. The porated states can be stable themselves, but they can also be transient structures in the translocation pathway. In that case, once enough peptides are adsorbed at the opposing monolayer leaflet, the pores seal. On the other hand, increased accumulation of certain peptides may lead to a detergent-like disintegration of the membrane resulting in formation of non-lamellar, e.g. micellar, systems (solubilization pathway). Note that the secondary structure of the peptides could vary along the various pathways. The helical or random configurations drawn here are merely illustrative of these processes and should not be taken literally.

Other simulations reveal deformations and bending phenomena without actual pore formation, although this is controversial and it has been argued that some simulations of CPP behaviour could be artifactual 410 . When attached to bulky cargo molecules, CPPs are believed to enter cells via endocytosis rather than direct translocation through the membrane, arguing that pore-formation in the plasma membrane might have very little role in actual delivery 116 . Thus, the mechanisms could be different when CPPs are present as lone molecules versus when they are conjugated to a cargo molecule. To explain the observations gathered from various studies, Miranker and colleagues propose a common mechanistic landscape for membrane-active peptides 433 . The initial formation of a pore is catalyzed by peptide-induced membrane tension that lowers the activation energy of spontaneous poration to a regime more accessible by thermal fluctuations (Figure 39 ) 433, 1463 . In other words, membrane-active peptides distort the structure of lipid bilayers to a point where pore formation becomes the most energetically favorable option at a given temperature. The structure and lifetime of such pores in live cells remain to be determined.",

It remains to be seen whether membrane-active peptides can create pores large enough for siRNA, mRNA, RNPs or larger protein influx without excessive cell toxicity.

Depending on the PFT, pore assembly may take place before reaching the target cell surface or via lateral diffusion and binding of monomers once embedded within the target cell plasma membrane. For many PFTs, the stoichiometry of the assembled pore is around 7 subunits, such as is the case for S. Aureus \u03b1-hemolysin or the aerolysin family. These PFTs form 1 -3 nm pores to permit the passage of ions, ATP, and nucleotides 399,439,1466 . Figure 40 . Schematic representation of the pore formation pathway of pore-forming toxins (PFTs). Soluble PFTs are recruited to the host membrane by protein receptors and/or specific interactions with lipids (for example, sphingomyelin for actinoporins or sterols for cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs)). Upon membrane binding, the toxins concentrate and start the oligomerization process, which usually follows one of two pathways. In the pathway followed by most \u03b2-PFTs, oligomerization occurs at the membrane surface, producing an intermediate structure known as a pre-pore (mechanism 1), which eventually undergoes conformational rearrangements that lead to concerted membrane insertion. In the pathway followed by most \u03b1-PFTs, PFT insertion into the membrane occurs concomitantly with a sequential oligomerization mechanism, which can lead to the formation of either a partially formed, but active, pore (mechanism 2), or the formation of complete pores. Although classified as \u03b2-PFTs, CDCs also share some of the features of this second pathway, as they can also form intermediate structures (known as 'arcs', named after their shape) during pore formation. In both \u03b1-PFT and \u03b2-PFT pathways, the final result is the formation of a transmembrane pore with different architecture, stoichiometry, size and conduction features, which promote the influx or efflux of ions, small molecules and proteins through the host membrane, and trigger various secondary responses involved in the repair of the host membrane. Note that, although the host membrane shown here is the eukaryotic plasma membrane, some PFTs are antibacterial and form pores in the inner membranes of gram-negative bacteria or the cell membranes of gram-positive bacteria. Owing to this specificity and their large pore size, CDCs are the PFTs that have primarily been used for intracellular delivery of larger cargo (>1 nm) and will be the focus of subsequent discussion in this section.

In the 1990s SLO began to be used widely for intracellular delivery purposes 1471 . Barry et al. demonstrated that antisense phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) could be introduced into cells during a brief permeabilization step with SLO 1471 . Cells were able to recover full function and showed maximum ODN-induced down regulation of gene expression at 18 hours before recovery to normal expression at 48 hours 1471 . A subsequent study compared SLO-mediated permeabilization versus electroporation for delivery of a restriction enzyme, concluding that electroporation was more cytotoxic and SLO a better option for both CHO and human fibroblast cells 1472 . In their hands, SLO provided a more uniform permeabilization across the cell population, possibly because electroporation is to some extent cell size-dependent. In another comparative study, SLO treatment, electroporation, and lipid-carriers were tested for delivery of antisense ODNs that neutralize BCR-ABL mRNA to reduce protein expression 1104 . Contrasting the earlier report, greater variation in ODN uptake was seen for SLO permeabilized cells when compared with electroporated cells in the chronic myeloid leukemia model cell line KYO-1.",

First, pre-titrated concentrations of high-quality SLO were administered to cells to determine precise concentrations for permeabilization in a variety of mammalian cell lines. Second, they deliberately employed calcium to trigger plasma membrane repair. With this approach, effective delivery of proteins and dextrans was achieved in 60-80% of cells with >50% long-term viability. Third, they explored the size limits of cargo influx to estimate pore size. SLO permeabilization was able to deliver 150 kDa dextrans but failed to mediate the passage of 250 kDa dextrans (approximate diameter ~23 nm) 866 . These results suggest that SLO pores exhibit a cutoff size in the range 20 nm. This is in reasonably good agreement with AFM images of another CDC family member perfringolysin O, which showed pore diameters of ~25 nm 1467 . A fourth observation was that calmodulin activity, intact microtubules, and cytoplasmic ATP only returned to normal levels after ~4 hrs. Under various conditions screened, the method permitted proteins to be delivered to approximately 50% of the total cell population under near-full retention of viability, a performance level that has since been confirmed by others 1474 .",

Lipid tails become more polar due to the presence of hydroperoxides, aldehyde or carboxyl groups. Consequently, these groups bend toward the water phase to allow hydrogen bonding with water and the lipid headgroups. The result of these distortions is an increase in area per lipid headgroup, which leads to membrane thinning, a decrease in lateral ordering, and membrane area expansion 436 . Using GUVS as a model system, Riske et al. artificially converted the native lipid phospatidylcholine to an oxidized version with hydroperoxides groups at the 9 or 10 chain position ( Figure 42C ). This was accomplished by using a membrane-localized amphiphile photosensitizer that generates singlet oxidation under irradiation with visible light. They found a substantial increase in GUVs membrane surface area without membrane disruption or evidence of poration 436 . It was hypothesized that more intense treatment would eventually lead to compromisation of membrane integrity, just like with detergents. Compared to the oxidized lipids investigated by Riske et al., oxidized lipids with truncated chains featuring aldehydes or carboxyl termini are much more potent perturbants of membrane organization 1532, 1533 . In the latter scenarios, simulations and experiments both observe pore formation and micellization as a function of concentration, concomitant with an increased susceptibility to bilayer rupture 437,438 .",

It was found that extensive hypotonic swelling rendered the cell membrane permeable to PEG300-400, but not to PEG600-1500. By reference to the hydrodynamic radii of these PEG molecules, the size-selectivity of membrane permeation yielded an estimate of \u223c0.74 nm for the cut-off radius of the swelling-activated channel 1540 . Further work identified SLC5A3 as an osmotically sensitive myo-inositol transporter that opens at imposed extracellular osmolarities of less than 200 mOsm 1541 . Thus, this set of endogenous channels may be manipulated by osmotic stimuli to transport small molecules into cells.",

Toxin monomers added to solution integrate into the plasma membranes of target cells and assemble to form an oligomeric pore complex. By adjusting the concentration of extracellular Zn 2+ , reversible permeabilization of the plasma membrane to small molecules (1 kDa or less) was achieved 1542 .

Indeed, many of the methods suffer from a lack of mechanistic insight to hone and optimize the salient parameters. Sonoporation is an example of a delivery strategy that has been challenging to optimize because of such complexity. In other cases, a membrane disruption method may work well but a lack of knowledge on appropriate environmental conditions leads to underperformance. For example, we have a limited understanding of how cell membranes behave and recover at different temperatures and osmolarities. Other methods feature clearly defined mechanisms but face intrinsic limitations because of the nature of the membrane disruption effect.

CRISPR-based gene editing is usually performed with the bacterial nuclease Cas9, which forms a complex, or ribonucleoprotein (RNP), with a single guide RNA (sgRNA) to become targetable and active 139 . Genome editing requires that nucleases enter the nucleus to exert their action on genomic DNA 17,140 . In the case of CRISPR, initial studies in live cells introduced Cas9 indirectly via expression from plasmids or mRNA 140,141 .

RNP delivery via electroporation has been demonstrated in a range of cell types, from common cell lines to blood and immune cells of clinical relevance, with both conventional cuvette style (Nucleofection) 30,143,146,147,287 and capillary electroporation (Neon) 45,144,145,1263 platforms. The mechanisms of RNP entry via electroporation have not been heavily studied yet.

Lentiviral transduction and electroporation have emerged as the two leading alternatives. However, procedures with viral vectors are sometimes unfavorable because they can: (1) be labor-intensive, inconsistent, and expensive, (2) present safety hazards, (3) cause untoward immune or inflammatory responses in vivo, and (4) carry a risk of insertional genotoxicity via genomic integration. Electroporation, on the other hand, is rapid and simple, but its core weakness is poor viability or loss of cell functionality, as has been reported for nucleofection of dendritic cells or T cells 279,1165,1264 . Nucleofection, in particular, has sought to build a reputation on effectiveness with hard-to-transfect cells 289,1108 . Nucleofection has demonstrated significant success with DNA and RNA transfection in various types of stem cells, primary cells, and post-mitotic cells.

Minimalist setups featuring standard 2 or 4 mm cuvettes, commercial pulse generators (such as the BioRad Gene Pulser or BTX units), and an electroporation buffer consisting of OPTIMEM media (or equivalent) have attained favorable results with macrophages 234,275 , T lymphocytes 187,257,551,1267-1271 , dendritic cells 186,260-262,1110,1272,1273 , and B cells 1274,1275 .

Parameters can be manipulated to focus the membrane-perturbing effects on different regions of the cell, such as certain parts of the plasma membrane or membranes of intracellular organelles (Figure 23). Additionally, the dual mechanisms of pore formation and electrophoretic propulsion of cargo may be beneficial for delivery of charged cargos, such as plasmid DNA or mRNA (Figure 24). Fundamentally, it is not well understood how cell structure, cytoskeleton, membrane proteins, domain phases, and membrane reservoirs influence electroporation in live cells, making it difficult to decipher critical molecular events. Additionally, the intrinsic pore-formation mechanisms bias electroporation toward the formation of numerous small pores, somewhat limiting the delivery of large cargoes.Electroporation has a number of challenges, especially post-treatment cell death. Indeed, the window for effective treatment can be quite narrow, especially in primary cells. Detrimental effects of electroporation can be attributed to electrochemical phenomena at the electrodes including Joule heating, pH waves, bubble formation, corrosion, and contamination of the solution. Other potential issues include electric field-based perturbation of native proteins, scrambling of lipid membranes, generation of ROS, and damage to cargo molecules. Technical innovations featuring different electrode designs or microfluidic and nanochannel designs have been developed to overcome some of these issues (Figure 28), but they have not yet superseded the basic cuvette-style electroporation, which remains the most widely used platform for common use.The challenges of current electroporation techniques notwithstanding, for many applications the benefits outweigh the weaknesses. Consequently, it has become the most widely used membrane disruption-mediated intracellular delivery approach. Electroporation has shown promise for treatment of a wide variety of patient derived cells and stem cells, with even the most basic electroporation platforms finding use among in vitro and ex vivo medical and industrial applications, from biomanufacture and clinical trials of cancer immunotherapy to ex vivo cell-based gene therapy and regenerative medicine.",

This applies both to the physical properties of lipid membranes and the active response of the cell (see section 4.3).Membrane permeability is known to increase during thermal phase transitions 73,1047,1301 . Both magnitude and rate of temperature changes influence the molecular rearrangements in membrane domains that are linked to the stochastic formation of defects1302 .

After recovery ~80% of the synaptosomes were properly functional and capable of recycling synaptic vesicles 1312 .Intracellular delivery by cooling-heating cycles has rarely been attempted in animal cells, probably due to the delicate and complex nature of cell recovery and growth from the frozen state. In one of the few cases where it was tested, trehalose (~0.34 kDa) was loaded into suspensions of adult islet cells by cooling them through their membrane phase transition 73 .Under conditions where cells were cooled at a rate of 1 \u00b0C per minute, permeability to trehalose was greatest around the region 0-5 \u00b0C 73 . Loaded trehalose exhibited cryoprotectant properties and was able to significantly increase cell survival and insulin production of islet cells. Building on this approach, Puhlev et al. compared intracellular delivery via cooling in suspension versus adherent fibroblasts. In their procedure cells were exposed to 50 mM trehalose for 5 minutes on ice, followed by 10 minutes at 37 \u00b0C1035 .

They incubated primary lymphocytes and lymphoma cell lines at 4 \u00b0C in HBSS buffer with antibodies in a buffer containing 2% FBS and 0.1 -0.3% saponin (10 -30 \u03bcg ml -1 or ~8 -24 \u03bcM) for 30 minutes.

Miller et al. employed lysophosphatidylcholine exposures to permeabilize CHO cells and maintain them assemi-intact cells capable of DNA synthesis for several hours 541 . The protocol was used to explore for soluble factors that inhibit or stimulate DNA synthesis. A follow-up paper outlined generalized protocols for delivery of cargo molecules to a wide range of monolayer and suspension cells1421 . In it, lysophosphatidylcholine concentrations from 30 -250 \u03bcg ml -1 (60 -500 \u03bcM) were chosen depending on the balance between delivery, viability, and leakage of the representative endogenous protein lactase dehydrogenase. Balinska employed lysophosphatidylcholine to introduce the exogenous nucleoside dTTP into the DNA of hepatoma cells via permeabilization-mediated intracellular delivery1422 . Because there was only a slight loss (20-25%) of lactate dehydrogenase, they concluded permeabilization of cells does not persistently disrupt membrane integrity and resealing could be achieved by exchanging back to standard media 1422 . Nomura and colleagues used lysophosphatidylcholine permeabilization for the delivery of larger proteins: diphtheria toxin (A fragment), horseradish peroxidase and antibodies against SV40 T-antigens1423 . These macromolecules were successfully introduced into living mouse erythroleukemia cells, baby hamster kidney, and mouse fibroblast cells1423 . Furthermore, lysophosphatidylcholine has been used to permeabilize primary human lymphocytes and monocytes for detection of intracellular antigens by flow cytometry 99 . 50 \u03bcg ml -1 (100 \u03bcM) of lysophosphatidylcholine was incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min before recovery with antibodies inside, thus avoiding the need for fixation.Along with lysophosphatidylcholine, similar compounds have been investigated for their detergent-like mechanisms. For example, simulations have been performed on plant-derived resorcinols1424 and dioctanoyl-phosphatidylcholine, a coneshaped counterpart of the native lipid DPPC1425 .

They developed a method to insert CNTs into lipid bilayers and live cell membranes to form conducting channels capable of transporting water, protons, small ions and DNA under physiological conditions (Figure 43B). It was found that the local channel and membrane charges control the conductance and ion selectivity of the CNT pores, thus suggesting potential starting points for engineering gating function.Recently one group devised molecular motors that can burrow through lipid membranes upon excitation with light 1550 .Upon physical adsorption of the molecular motors onto lipid bilayers and subsequent activation by ultraviolet light, holes were drilled in the cell membranes.

The magnetic core enables their uptake and localization to be tracked by MRI 319 . In another case, the mechanical and physiological properties of fibroblasts were measured as a function of intracellular uptake of biocompatible magnetic nanoparticles and the applied magnetic field 320 . nanodiamonds were then used as local temperature gauges to perform nanometer-scale thermometry in living cells at microkelvin resolution 322 .

            "text": "). Examples of large cargo that have been delivered into cells are shown in the bottom left quadrant of Figure 3, and include bacteria, mitochondria, whole chromosomes, microbeads, sperm, nuclei, and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) devices. The first demonstration of large cargo delivery occurred alongside the invention of microinjection itself in 1911 324 . Marshall Barber demonstrated that a single bacterium, once inside the cytoplasm of a plant cell, was sufficient to kill it 324,325 .For a century microinjection has been the dominant method for introducing large cargo into cells. Microinjection was used for the first nuclear transplant experiments that surgically dissected the nucleus from blastula cells and inserted them into living frog eggs 326 . To the amazement of the researchers, these eggs then had the potential to grow and produce a new animal. Building on this breakthrough, John Gurdon and colleagues showed that nuclei transplanted from fully differentiated somatic cells were capable of generating a new animal 327,328 . Based on this work. Gurdon later shared the Nobel prize for \"the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent\". Microinjection was also required for the nuclear transplant that led to the first mammalian cloning, as exemplified by the birth of Dolly the sheep in 1997 329 . Furthermore, in an unconventional form of gene therapy, transplant of pronuclei from human eggs with pathological mitochondria to donor eggs with functional mitochondria has been shown to correct diseases of IVF occurs through the artificial delivery of sperm into eggs cells. The IVF concept was first demonstrated through microinjection of sperm into sea urchin eggs 331 . Subsequently, IVF generated the first human pregnancies in the early 1990s 332 . Chromosome transplantation techniques have also been described with microinjection apparatus 333 . Indeed, artificial chromosomes have been engineered and transferred into cells by microinjection for transgenic studies or proof-of-concept gene therapy334,335 . In another example of large cargo delivery, While microinjection has traditionally dominated large cargo delivery, it is not the only option. Indeed, several rival methods have arisen mainly out of the need for greater throughput. For example, Chiou and colleagues pioneered an approach using laser-triggered cavitation bubbles to deliver ~2 \u03bcm bacteria into cultured cells at both single cell339 and high throughput scales 340 . The same approach was extended to delivery of functional mitochondria for studies of mitochondrial dysfunction in metabolic diseases 341 . Another method of mitochondrial transfer is cell fusion, where the mitochondria are supplied from donor cells 342,343 . In studies involving gene therapy with human artificial chromosome they can also be transferred by cell fusion, in a process termed microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT) 192,344-347 . Engineered CHO donor cells carry the human chromosome and are triggered to fuse with the acceptor cell, thus transferring the genetic material 344 . Apart from delivery of organelles and subcellular components, insertion of large synthetic materials and devices is another area of interest. As a case in point, micron-scale particles, spheres, and beads have been loaded into cells for intracellular microrheology studies that analyze the internal mechanics and dynamics of cells. So far they have been delivered by microinjection 348,349 or ballistic propulsion 350-353 . A recent study microinjected PEGylated tracer beads of up to 0.5 \u03bcm into cells to show that motor-driven cytoplasmic mixing substantially enhances intracellular movement of both small and large components 354 . In another study of cell mechanics, ~1 \u03bcm melamine particles coated with PEG were fired into HeLa cells by a gene gun to study glassy dynamics in the cytosol 355 . Magnetic cargoes have also been used to probe the intracellular environment. Moch et al. loaded 2.8 \u00b5m magnetic beads into the cytoplasm of mammalian cells for probing cell mechanical properties by magnetic tweezers 356 . Garzon-Coral et al. measured mitotic spindle forces one-and two-cell intracellular properties, such as cytoplasmic pressure 49 .

            "text": "The other major type of carriers for nucleic acid delivery are viral vectors, which exploit the viral infection pathway to enter cells but avoid the subsequent expression of viral genes that leads to replication and pathogenicity 191 . This is done by deleting coding regions of the viral genome and replacing them with the DNA to be delivered, which either integrates into host chromosomal DNA or exists as an episomal vector. At present, viral vectors are the most clinically advanced nucleic acid delivery agents owing to their high efficiency and specificity. They were first employed from the 1970sconstructedMechanistic investigations indicate that most carriers enter cells via endocytosis before escaping into the cytoplasm 226,363,376,377 (Figure 5). Mechanisms of endocytosis available to nanocarriers include phagocytosis and pinocytosis through clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent pathways 363,377 . The pathways employed by target cells are dependent upon the particle size, shape, material composition, surface chemistry and/or charge 226,363,376-378 . Cargo not able to escape endosomes are trafficked through lysosomes for degradation or recycled back out to the cell surface 379-381 . Maximal efficiencies of around 1% endosomal escape have been reported for the most advanced non-viral carrier strategies, including lipid nanoparticles 380,382 and cell-penetrating peptides 116 . Moreover, the exact mechanisms of endosome escape remain unclear and are a matter of ongoing research 379-381,383 .Alternatively, some carriers are able to fuse directly with the plasma membrane. These systems were first inspired by viruses that deploy specialized surface proteins to induce fusion with target membranes 89,384 . Fusogenic carriers are bound by a phospholipid bilayer that hosts the fusion machinery or confers fusion intrinsic properties. Examples include 1) cell",

Rapid exocytosis, plugging, and patching are typical mechanisms that cells deploy to repair large holes 444 . For smaller disruptions, internalization through endocytosis or externalization through shedding serves to extract lesions into a disposable vesicle[454][455][456] . Very small holes, particularly from electroporation or lingering pore-forming toxins, can persist for longer durations and drain the cell of resources399,454,457,458 .
