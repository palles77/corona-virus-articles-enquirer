A recent review by Zowawi highlighted the worrying reports of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase-producing isolates among Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii [3] . With Saudi hospitals reporting soaring AMR rates, widespread misuse of antimicrobials and fears of resistance to last-resort antibiotics [3, 4] , interventions are urgently required to curb inappropriate antimicrobial use and AMR rates. Implementing antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs) in Saudi hospitals has been recommended to optimise the use of antimicrobials and to reduce AMR rates [4, 5] . The potential of these interventions has been recognised by the Saudi Ministry of Health (MoH) through the introduction of a national antimicrobial stewardship plan as part of the Arab Gulf regional strategy to reduce the threat of AMR [6] .",

However, due to the shortage of ID consultants and microbiologists [2] , these antimicrobial stewardship initiatives face sustainability challenges in tertiary care and are less likely to be implemented in secondary care where adoption of ASPs remains low [10] . Collaborations and the formation of ASP teams, including microbiologists, hospital pharmacists, physicians, nurses and infection control practitioners, could increase the capacity of hospitals to adopt ASPs and improve their implementation [11] . Although various studies have explored ASP team members' perspectives on programme adoption and implementation in healthcare systems where members' roles are well developed, data from healthcare systems such as Saudi Arabia, where ASP teams are novice, remain scarce. Understanding the experiences and perspectives of physicians, pharmacists, microbiologists, infection control practitioners, hospital managers, nurses and MoH personnel of ASP adoption could enhance the adoption of ASPs in Saudi hospitals. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the current ASP perspectives and experiences in Saudi MoH hospitals in order to identify factors influencing their adoption through a qualitative study.",

First, sociopolitical context barriers, including lack of adherence to guidelines and legislation. Second, healthcare organisation-related barriers such as lack of management support, disintegration, poor communication, lack of recruitment/shortage of ASP team members, lack of education and training, and lack of health information technology (IT).

First, physicians are not always aware that such policies exist as this is not a routine part of their orientation programme (T2 Q1-2). Second, the ASP guidelines and policies are not always accessible electronically (T2 Q3) as the policies are distributed across the departments (by either the Infection Control Department or Pharmacy or both) often in a paper format that only a few staff members have direct access to. Third, poor enforcement and implementation of ASP policies is a significant contributing factor to the lack of adherence to this strategy.

Thus, physicians resort to prescribing broad-spectrum antimicrobials to prevent deterioration and complications. Similar practices have been reported in other countries [37] . Leadership from the MoH to enforce antimicrobial stewardship guidelines, and their enforcement from the hospital administration, are likely to address physicians' fears and concerns. Prescribers are likely to consider the risks and benefits of antimicrobial prescribing for current as well as future patients [38] .",

However, there are limitations to this study. Although different healthcare professionals involved in antimicrobial stewardship were interviewed, the sample was composed of staff who are aware of ASPs and thus there is a possibility that the results portrayed do not reflect the views of healthcare professionals who lack experience of ASPs. Furthermore, the study was based on a small number of hospitals (n = 3) that were not geographically representative of all Saudi MoH hospitals. A national survey, which forms the quantitative part of this project, involving all MoH hospitals would improve our understanding of the state and the factors affecting ASPs adoption at a national level.",

The emphasis on enforcement of antimicrobial stewardship guidelines could not be more explicit; ASP adoption and implementation in Saudi hospitals must be formally endorsed by the MoH and enforced and supported by the hospital administration to relieve physicians' liability pressures and to improve their antimicrobial stewardship practices. The lack of human and health IT resources to support antimicrobial stewardship must be addressed before the benefits of ASP adoption and implementation can be realised.",

No one can ask a physician why you have used such combinations relating to antibiotics' Q5 T3: Lack of administrative/ management support 'The management of the hospital should be aware of the topic to follow it . . . The hospital director should follow up the programme and There is no communication between the pharmacy and doctors as there is with infection control' Q1 'If there is any memo from pharmacy, especially for the-if this medicine is not available or sometimes this medicine is-they are not sending anything regarding the antibiotic policy' Q2 'Communication is very difficult' Q3 T6: Shortage of ASP team members 'We don't have clinical pharmacists' Q1 'Members in the (ASP) team are infection control and clinical pharmacy . . . there should be such team in the hospital' Q2 'It is supposed that every department has an infection control nurse, and clinical pharmacist whose role is to follow up the antibiotic use. This idea should be applied in every department, not in only one department' Q3 'The clinical pharmacist, this is a new job for us, we need to increase the number of infectious disease staff . . . because we only have one doctor for the whole hospital' Q4 'We want an ID consultant, and it is preferred that he remains in his position for a long time' Q5 'The ID's role is active, but we have only one ID in the hospital. So it is difficult to follow up all matters. You need the IDs and you need ID pharmacists' Q6 'We don't have micro-pathologists . . . peripheral hospitals don't have culture . . . there is lack of infrastructure of labs' Q7",
