In the event of an influenza pandemic, optometrists may be challenged with a host of issues, including impediments to clinical patient care, manufacture and delivery of ophthalmic devices, and maintaining business continuity and infection control. OVERVIEW: This report reviews pandemic influenza, the effect of a pandemic event on business survival, and response measures for the primary eye care provider. The ethical and legal issues surrounding control of a pandemic influenza and the prospect of telemedicine as a form of social distancing are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures to control a pandemic influenza will help prepare the eye care provider for addressing challenges to patient care and business continuity in the face of a highly contagious disease. Understanding the legal and ethical issues that arise during a pandemic event will help optometrists make informed choices as health care professionals and as citizens. Optometry 2007;78:629-643",

Polymerase chain reaction is also available for identification of the influenza strain. 4 It is estimated that accurate diagnosis based on history and clinical findings approaches 70% when compared with virus isolation by cell culture, 5 which is the definitive standard. 6 Rapid, in-office diagnostic tests for influenza are available, some of which are waived from requirements under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and provide results in under 30 minutes, yielding reasonably good sensitivity (median, 70% to 75%) and excellent specificity (90% to 95%) compared with viral culture. 7 Cough and fever within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms appears to be the best predictor of seasonal influenza infection, with a positive predictive value of 79% in adults 8 and 83% in children older than 4. 9 Infection in mammals, including humans, is confined primarily to tracheo-bronchial epithelial cells and depends on inhalation of infective airborne droplet nuclei. 10, 11 The first replication cycle is completed in 4 to 6 hours, with extremely high titers of viral shed leading to explosive outbreaks of infection. Clinical features of an influenza infection in general depend on the virulence of the particular strain and include the abrupt onset of fever (38\u00b0C to 40 o C), chills, cough, headache, muscle ache, sore throat, and other nonspecific symptoms, which can persist for 1 to 2 weeks.",

            "text": "Seasonal influenza is a deadly disease, and over the last decade, an average of 36,000 Americans each year have died from it. 12 Excess mortality from a pandemic of influenza has resulted from complications of the primary infection, including viral and bacterial pneumonia and pulmonary manifestations resulting from the release of inflammatory cytokines and other chemo-attractants by the host immune system, what is termed cytokine storm. 5 Cytokine storm may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a condition characterized by vessel dilatation, leukocyte influx, pulmonary necrosis and the destruction of tissue. 13 ARDS is believed to have accounted for up to one half of all deaths from the Spanish flu of 1918 to 1920, 14 although a dysfunctional and inadequate host immune response has recently been found to augment lethality of this virus in a primate model of pulmonary infection. 15 To date, the majority of human deaths related to H5N1 avian influenza have been caused by respiratory failure secondary to ARDS. 16 Influenza is particularly devastating among the elderly (patients \u054665 years old). In examining influenza epidemics and pandemics in the United States since 1918, elderly patients had higher excess flu mortality rates than nonelderly patients with the exception of the 1918 to 1919 pandemic. The ratios of excess deaths of elderly versus nonelderly in some influenza seasons were as high as 131 to 1. 17 Although major concerns about influenza revolve around respiratory problems (including death from respiratory failure), there are ocular components of the disease. Certain strains of influenza are marked by conjunctivitis as a presenting sign. 18, 19 In another published study of influenza aboard a commercial airliner, half of the patients complained of photophobia. 20 The conjunctiva and other mucous membranes are recognized to be portals of entry of influenza virus for avian-to-human and human-to-human transmission in some cases. 18, 21 During flu vaccinations in 2000, a small series of vaccines developed a purported adverse reaction to the vaccination (distinct from a true allergic reaction to the vaccine itself) that manifested as respiratory symptoms accompanied by a follicular conjunctivitis with hyperemia and discharge within 4 hours of receiving the vaccine. 22 A smaller number of cases were reported in subsequent years. 23",

Genetic analysis of some outbreaks suggests that global transport of viruses can achieve this. 26 Theoretically, minor mutations could quickly create an exceptionally virulent strain. A study using animal models showed that a change in a single amino acid in a portion of the hemagglutinin protein increased the lethality of the mutated strain by 50,000-fold. 27 Fortunately, most mutations in flu virus' RNA do not result in changes in amino acid sequence, so the protein structure (and pathogenicity) remains unchanged. 26",

In a typical season, flu will cause approximately 110,000 hospitalizations in the United States. 29 From October 2005 through May 2006, more than 17,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza were reported in the United States. 30 In the event of a flu pandemic, it is estimated that about 30% of the United States population, or 100 million people, could become ill, 31 with more than 200,000 deaths. 32 These shocking estimates are a by-product not only of the dramatic rate of infection but projections that the spread of infection will occur in 2 or 3 large waves, each lasting 6 to 8 weeks over the course of 1 to 2 years. 33 With a pandemic influenza, even if sick individuals were isolated, and identification of contacts was 90% successful, the disease would be difficult to control, mostly because of the very short incubation period of the disease. 34 Although much attention has been given to flu pandemics, it is worth noting that in the years between pandemics, the cumulative morbidity from influenza is greater than the expected toll during a pandemic. 24",

Most deaths occurred in persons between the ages of 20 and 40, and by 1920, as many as 100 million people died. 39 Approximately 675,000 Americans died from the flu in 1918 and 1919 (about 5 times the typical flu-related mortality rate). 40 The emergence of this pandemic (caused by the H1N1 strain) in the army camps of Western Europe has been attributed to a convergence of overcrowding; proximity of pigs, horses, and bird markets; and the presence of many mutagenic gases deployed as part of combat operations during World War I. 41 Despite the high attack rate and virulence, most infections were subclinical, and more than 99% of those who contracted the virus survived despite the absence of antivirals, vaccines, and antibiotics. 42 The next flu pandemic, from 1957 to 1958, originated in the Yunan Province of China and is commonly called the Asian Flu. 37 Transmission of this H2N2 virus occurred principally along the sea lanes, and the entire globe became affected within 6 months. More than 40% of the world's population became infected, with 25% having clinically typical disease, and most deaths occurring as a consequence of secondary bacterial pneumonia. 43 Total mortality is believed to have exceeded 1 million persons. 36 During 1968 and 1969, another strain emerged causing the \"Hong Kong\" influenza pandemic (H3N2), which also was caused by a direct genetic exchange (re-assortment event) between duck and human viral subtypes. 5 Worldwide mortality rates were lower compared with those of the Asian flu outbreak; still, as many as 750,000 people died. Descendents of the 1968 H3N2 virus cause the majority of influenza infections today. 44 It has been 38 years since the last flu pandemic; over the last 300 years, the longest recorded interval between pandemics is 39 years. 45 Typical seasonal outbreaks or epidemics result from antigenic variation in previously circulating influenza A and B viruses as a consequence of cumulative and advantageous genetic mutations. The accumulation of mutational advantages is known as \"antigenic drift.\" Such mutations allow the virus to elude detection by a previously exposed immune system.",

Larger values of R o imply that the disease can be disseminated easily within the population. If R o is greater than 1, then it is vital that measures be taken within the population to control spread. But if R o is less than 1, the disease may be best contained by tracking down and sequestering the infective individual(s) rather than placing burdens (such as mass vaccination) across the entire population. 49 For a pandemic influenza, the R o is estimated to be approximately 4 (as a frame of reference, malaria has an R o of 1.6, and measles has an R o of approximately 17). 48, 50 Statistical models of R o assume a homogenous population, and efforts have been made to refine the model to reflect the diversity of the U.S. population (e.g., age, sex, and vaccination status) to better identify more effective control measures for various subpopulations. 51",

            "text": "Targeted vaccination of children before all other population groups appears to be more effective in minimizing spread of illness compared with randomly distributing a limited supply of vaccine (unless emergent strains were to disproportionately infect other age groups). 57, 58 Vaccinating children could prevent about one third of secondary household cases of flu. 59, 60 Vaccinating 80% of children and teenagers would yield nearly the equivalent effect of vaccinating 80% of the entire population in terms of numbers of cases prevented. However, vaccinating 80% of children would not be as effective in preventing the onset of an epidemic compared with vaccinating 80% of all people. 58 Other statistical models suggest that 80% vaccination of children could be up to 93% effective in containing a pandemic influenza, and 65% effective in preventing a pandemic influenza. Mortality and economic costs would also be reduced sharply. 61 Several antiviral medications currently are available, and efficacy against influenza viruses has been well documented, although antivirals are not a substitute for vaccination but rather play an adjunctive role in prevention and containment. There are 2 current classes of antiviral influenza medications based on mechanism of action. One inhibits the active site of the neuraminidase (NA) enzyme (an enzyme vital to releasing progeny viruses inside the host) and the other inhibits the matrix protein M2 proton pump of the influenza virus (a step required for viral uncoating inside the host cell). 62 M2 proton pump inhibitors include amantadine and rimantadine; both have been used in the treatment of influenza for more than 4 decades. 63 Neuraminidase inhibitors include oseltamivir and zanamivir. Both classes of anti-influenza medication appear to be effective in decreasing the severity of disease for those already infected (by up to 60%) as well as in preventing onset of influenza when used prophylactically (by up to 85%), although only oseltamivir is approved in the United States for prophylactic use. [62] [63] [64] Oseltamivir is most effective when administered within 48 hours of infection, and efficacy decreases rapidly by 60 hours postinfection. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae; Roche Laboratories, Nutley, New Jersey) can be administered orally, whereas zanamivir (Relenza\u00ae; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) must be inhaled as a dry powder. 21 There is evidence of drug resistance for both classes of antivirals (particularly amantadine), but the chance of the development of widespread resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors is considered to be low. 21, 62 However, there is a distinct possibility that a particularly virulent strain just may not respond to pharmacologic therapy. Statistical models may be able to reveal the efficacy (or lack thereof) of any control measure within 2 weeks. 65 Because of these uncertainties, prophylactic use of antiviral medications remains controversial.",

            "text": "Because emergence of new and destructive pathogens is so unpredictable, surveillance is the first line of defense in the broad-scale detection and containment of outbreaks. 68 Surveillance is performed at many levels, from the local community to global agencies. In addition to formal methods of surveillance by public health agencies at all levels of government, alternative forms of surveillance can provide early clues to the beginning of disease outbreaks. Sudden increases in \"rumors\" via Internet bulletin boards or cellular phone text messages were noted in the early stages of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 69 (a deadly respiratory infection that emerged from Asia in 2003 that is caused by a coronavirus and characterized by fever, diarrhea, and pneumonia 70 ). Formal electronic communication between infection control professionals has enhanced surveillance efforts. 71 Social distancing refers to physical separation of infectious and high-risk individuals from other susceptible individuals in the hope of controlling the spread of disease by reducing person-to-person contact. Social distancing on a global scale may entail curtailing air travel to prevent illnesses from \"hopscotching\" across large areas. For example, the 2003 outbreak of SARS originated in China and spread to Hong Kong and ultimately to 22 countries, in part, as a result of air travel. 72 Five international commercial airliners were linked to the spread of SARS from infected passengers to fellow passengers and airline crew. 73 A 1979 cluster of influenza A aboard a commercial aircraft was documented in which 72% of passengers had contracted the same viral strain. 20 Efforts to limit air travel, however, would require the isolation of many larger airports 74 and consistent adherence to advice that symptomatic passengers postpone travel or seek medical advice if they have flu symptoms. 75 The decrease in airline travel after the September 11, 2001, attacks provided an opportunity to observe a change in the spread of influenza resulting from altered travel patterns. The influenza season that year was delayed and smaller presumably because fewer travelers translated into fewer opportunities to disseminate flu across the country. 76 Mathematical models have been devised to predict the onset of peak incidence of influenza during an epidemic or pandemic as well as the role of air travel in spreading disease. Models suggest that air travel does add to the number of predicted cases of influenza across the nation, and such models can also help characterize an epidemic once it has started. 76 Another model suggests that if an influenza strain is highly transmissible (similar to the spread of SARS), a global outbreak could quickly spread if even a few infected individuals were allowed to travel to just 3 major destination cities. Isolating the top 2% most populous cities from the normal influx of visitors could cut the need to vaccinate by almost one half. 74 Community-level social distancing would be aimed at decreasing person-to-person contact. This could include steps such as canceling large-scale events and encouraging workplace strategies to decrease person-to-person contact, such as working remotely from home, teleconferencing, and increasing physical distance of workstations. 77 It is widely accepted that young children most easily transmit the virus. This is attributable to the observations that: (1) children experience a large number of contacts with other children in school or daycare, (2) children are assumed to be more susceptible because of lower immune status, and (3) children could be more infectious because they shed more virus and shed the virus for a longer time period compared with older individuals. 59 Modeling of social contacts suggests that teenagers may also substantially increase the spread of influenza. 78 Because children (especially preschoolers) are thought to play a major role in spreading influenza in the community, some social distancing strategies are directed specifically at children, including closure of schools and daycare facilities. One study estimates more than 40% of secondary flu cases are attributable to exposure to a sick preschool child. The effectiveness of social distancing targeting children is demonstrated by a study showing that the proportion of sick children decreased sharply once winter school recess commenced. The entire profile of this epidemic changed abruptly as a result of interrupting the cycle of infection by sending children home for the holidays. 79 Such a strategy is not foolproof, however, because some benefits could be negated by increased spread of illness in the home or neighborhood when school is canceled. Even with school closures, preventing contact with nonhousehold children markedly increased the efficacy of social distancing. 78 In the event of a pandemic outbreak of the flu, the multitude of persons expected to become ill will likely overwhelm hospitals and other health care facilities. This challenge of so-called \"surge capacity\" is a concern for clinic administrators and planners at the community public health level. Efforts are being made to increase surge capacity to meet the unprecedented demand for care anticipated during a pandemic. Measures include identification of temporary clinical care areas on the premises of health care facilities or makeshift patient wards in large structures (e.g., aircraft hangars, recreation centers, churches), predetermined procedures to facilitate and monitor home care, and caching of specific supplies. 80 Surge capacity also can be enhanced by restricting elective surgeries to free up beds and personnel. 81 Benefits of using various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic control measures would be (1) a lower total number of cases of illness (versus no interventions), (2) a dampening of the peak number of cases during each outbreak, and (3) spreading out the number of sick patients over a longer time interval. 79, 82 Flattening and extending the pattern of an epi-demic or pandemic will make the outbreak more manageable and less overwhelming at any given point in time.",

Surgical masks are worn over the nose and mouth such as those worn in the operating room. N-95 respirators are masks designed to be 95% effective in filtering particles down to 0.3 m in size and are used in a variety of occupational settings. Facemasks must be replaced frequently because the accumulation of moisture from breathing will decrease the ability to block the penetration of microbes. 92 Use of facemasks and covering the mouth when sneezing may have helped reduce transmission of SARS. 93 Official recommendations for the use of respiratory protection are undergoing constant review. Recently, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), an arm of the CDC, modified prior recommendations from 2004 and now advocates the use of N-95 respirators for workers engaged in activities with the high likelihood of generating infectious aerosols. 94 Other CDC guidance documents recommend the use of surgical masks in the event of a shortage of N-95 respirators. Surgical masks offer protection from larger aerosol droplets and are not as effective as the N-95 in protecting the wearer. If respiratory protection is worn, users must be trained in its proper use, including advice on proper fitting, maintenance and hygiene, re-use protocols and proper disposal of used respirators. 95 Despite recommendations for the use of respirators or surgical masks in caring for flu patients in the health care setting, the Department of Health and Human Services is stopping short of recommending their use by the general public unless they are caring for family members known to be ill from pandemic influenza. 96 The CDC's recommendations for airline flight crews encourage giving sick passengers surgical masks to reduce dissemination of aerosol particles to others in the aircraft cabin. 97 Still, the government has not strongly advocated their use elsewhere by sick individuals nor have they encouraged production and stockpiling of respirators or sur-gical masks for use during a pandemic. 98 In addition, there is a stigma in most Western countries about wearing surgical face masks and respirators in public, and this may prove to be a barrier to their use. 99 Hogg and Houston 89 have developed a simple mnemonic, MASKS, for basic precautions that can be taken in an outpatient setting:",

For example, online consultations, performed during an investigation of a cluster of acute gastrointestinal diseases, aided in early containment of cholera at a religious gathering in India. 100 Telemedicine in eye care has been shown to be useful, valid, and cost effective for a number of years in managing both anterior and posterior segment eye disease. [101] [102] [103] [104] In the context of social distancing, sending clinical data electronically to an ophthalmic specialist for online consultation could reduce the need for patients to visit another public gathering place (e.g., the specialist's clinic or hospital setting) and in turn may reduce patients' exposure to contagious individuals.",

It is estimated that a pandemic flu outbreak could result in a negative impact on the United States economy of approximately $166 billion in lost productivity and direct medical costs. 105 Another study estimates that insurers could have to pay up to $155 billion in life insurance claims from flu-related deaths. 106 Globally, economic losses caused by a pandemic flu could reach $800 billion. 107 By comparison, the estimated economic toll of hurricane Katrina was about $140 billion. 108 Workers compensation insurance could provide some relief from medical bills and disability if it could be proven that the illness arose out of and in the course of employment. A pandemic flu is not specifically a compensable work-related condition at this time, but state-by-state regulatory changes could provide a partial payment mechanism for health care costs if the situation arises. 32 Outbreaks of disease can change societal goals and allocation of resources. During an epidemic of a disease, the goal may be to minimize death and disability; during a disease pandemic, the goal may shift to preserving basic functioning of society by devoting available resources to maintenance of critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services and utilities. 109, 110 Major unsettling events-particularly ones with national or global implications-can adversely affect entire industries, and health care is not immune to such systemic shocks. Optometrists are relatively unique in the health care sector as service providers while also being a link in the chain of commerce. In the case of a pandemic flu, fear of contagion, logistical and transportation challenges, understaffing of utility companies, suppliers, and couriers, and a host of other problems can impede the ability to give or receive goods and services. As other companies experience employee absenteeism, a \"domino effect\" could arise causing a shortage of manufacturing and warehouse personnel as well as a shortage of drivers and couriers fearing contracting illness during one of many delivery stops.",

A study of disasters has shown that two thirds of businesses that do not open within 2 weeks after a catastrophe will file bankruptcy within 1 year. 111 Businesses affected by acute natural disasters (e.g., earthquake and flood) suffer problems such as lack of employee and customer accessibility and shipping delays that contribute to business losses and impede recovery. As both demand (customer volume) and supply (employee productivity) decrease in the wake of disaster, business owners may find it difficult to recover. If particular neighborhoods or regions become branded as areas of higher risk, challenges to recovery become magnified. 112 The fear of SARS, for example, caused a dramatic downturn of activity in the \"Chinatown\" areas of numerous North American cities, such as Toronto, Boston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. 113, 114 Canada alone experienced economic losses of over $1 billion because of SARS even though there were fewer than 500 patients directly affected by the disease. Given the millions of cases predicted in a flu pandemic, the economic costs would be truly staggering. 114 Providers of services and goods whose markets are limited to a local level (optometrists, for example) are more vulnerable to delays in long-term recovery after disaster. 115",

Production of novel antiviral medications cannot begin until the unique genetic features of the offending pathogen are identified. This is not to say, however, that likely candidates for novel and highly virulent infection cannot be identified in advance and that production of vaccine and medicines with at least some probabilistic efficacy cannot proceed, as has been seen with development of neutralizing antibody responses in human subjects given a prototype H5N1 vaccine. 130 An influenza vaccination, however, is far more cost effective than antiviral treatment or prohylaxis. 105, 131 There is substantial evidence that dilution of a vaccine provides at least some measure of protection, 132-134 even for the experimental H5N1 vaccine, 130 although antibody titers definitely rise with increasing dosage to levels deemed to give adequate (\u03fe50% of the vaccinated population) immunity. Given the crisis of a virulent influenza pandemic, however, it may be that diluting the available vaccine to at least partially but equally immunize a much larger percentage of the population would preserve social trust and be most ethically defensible by maximizing equitable distribution of risk.",

Previous public health emergencies have created the need for compulsory enforcement of public health measures but also raise legal and ethical questions. Is it fair, for example, to require compulsory vaccinations? Some may argue that exposing a person to the risk of adverse effect of a hastily concocted vaccine in a pandemic situation is an unfair proposition. One publication speaks against exposing someone to the unknown because \"(d)ue to the preventive nature of vaccines, in contrast to therapeutic treatment of existing disease, it is difficult to determine with confidence if an unvaccinated person will in fact contract disease.\" 137 Still, case law, such as Jacobson v. Massachusetts affirms the government's right to require people to be vaccinated depending on the circumstances of the day, and the courts generally have acted in deference to public health officials in determining when vaccinations are compulsory. 138 What has been articulated less clearly in the current environment is the \"duty to care\" of health care providers in the event of an outbreak that poses significant risk to the health and life of those providers. 122 In the face of this risk, the underlying principle of beneficence dictates that doctors have a duty to care for patients in time of need, even if doing so would endanger the doctor's own well-being. The CDC has declared that the issue of duty to care is of central importance in pandemic planning and response. 139 However, the historical and ethical obligation of health care providers to care for the sick must be balanced against the limited number of professionals available to treat patients now and in the future, the medical necessity of services rendered by particular specialties, and the individual doctor's rights to life and health. 140 Can an employee be forced to get a flu shot?",
