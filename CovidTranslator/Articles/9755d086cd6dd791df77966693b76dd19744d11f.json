The primary endpoint was time to normalisation of patients' respiratory status (respiratory rate of \u226420 breaths per min for adults or age-defined thresholds of 20-38 breaths per min for children) and a room air oxygen saturation of 93% or more.

            "text": "Pandemic influenza is a global health threat. In an outbreak, there is a need for new countermeasures that can be rapidly implemented. Plasma therapy has been used experimentally for the past 100 years to treat severe infectious diseases: diphtheria in the 1890s; Spanish flu pandemic of 1917-18; severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003; the Ebola epidemic in west Africa in 2014-15; and, most recently, Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2014-16. A meta-analysis of eight non-randomised studies of convalescent blood products during the 1917-18 influenza pandemic calculated a case-fatality rate of 16% among 336 treated participants compared with 37% among 1219 controls. 1 A cohort study of 93 participants with severe H1N1 influenza demonstrated lower mortality in the treatment group receiving H1N1 convalescent plasma versus the control group who received standard care (20\u00b70% vs 54\u00b78%; p=0\u00b701), 2 although mortality in the control group was higher than expected for comparable severity of illness. [3] [4] [5] [6] Despite these encouraging data, no randomised controlled trial of immune plasma for severe influenza has ever been done. Suggested reasons are that these studies are expensive and complex, working with experimental blood products is hard for many blood establishments, this intervention cannot be commercialised, and there is a reluctance to use blood products due to perceived associated risks. In an effort to more rigorously assess the role of immune plasma in the treatment of severe influenza, we did a randomised controlled trial in a nonpandemic setting in participants with respiratory compromise due to influenza.",

A meta-analysis of previous cohort studies during the 1918 influenza pandemic showed a case-fatality rate of 16% among participants treated with plasma, serum, or whole blood compared with 37% among controls. However, the exclusions, details of the intervention (eg, antibody titre), and structured outcome assessments in these studies are difficult to assess. In 2009, a cohort study with convalescent plasma in the treatment of pandemic H1N1 influenza resulted in a mortality of 20% in the treatment group versus 54% the control group. However, mortality in the control group in this study was higher than expected raising the concern for bias in patient selection.

The secondary endpoints included: incidence and duration of clinical symptoms and fever, time to resolution of all symptoms and fever, in-hospital and 28 day mortality, duration of hospital stay, number of admissions and duration of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), incidence and duration of supplemental oxygen, incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, incidence and duration of requiring mechanical ventilation, and disposition (home with no health care, home with health care, transferred to long-term care facility, hospital stay ongoing at day 28, discharged to hospice care, deceased) after the last hospital discharge. All secondary analysis including subgroups were prespecified in a formal statistical analysis plan, with the exception of the six step ordinal scale of clinical status at day 7, which was developed for a separate anti-influenza intravenous hyperimmune immunoglobulin study (NCT02287467) and was used post-hoc in this study. There were limited data available on which to base sample size calculations for this study. However, the sample size of 100 was calculated to be sufficient to detect a decrease in the median time to normalisation of respiratory status from 14 days to 7 days with 89% power at a two-sided 5% significance level.",

A post-hoc analysis of participants treated within 5 days of symptom onset reduced mortality (none (0%) of 12 vs four [40%] of ten, odds ratio 0\u00b714; p=0\u00b704), although conversely those treated after 5 days had increased mortality (five [100%] of five vs none [0%] of seven, no statistical analysis reported). 11 To our knowledge, this randomised controlled trial is the first of immune plasma in the treatment of a respiratory virus disease. Although the study was not able to conclusively show efficacy on the basis of the primary endpoint (resolution of tachypnoea and hypoxia), compared with the standard care group, 14% more patients in the treatment group had resolution of tachypnoea and hypoxia (p=0\u00b7069), there was significant improvement reported in clinical status at day 7 (p=0\u00b7020), and there was numerically decreased mortality (one patient vs five patients, p=0\u00b7093).

            "text": "The absence of a measurable antiviral effect is difficult to interpret. The need for virological efficacy endpoints in influenza therapeutics has been well argued 12 but, to date, even oseltamivir has not shown conclusive efficacy in terms of decreased viral shedding. 13 A previous study 2 with anti-influenza convalescent plasma did report a difference in rate of decrease of viral shedding, although the cohort design and high mortality in the control group make direct comparisons to this study difficult. The previous study 11 with hyperimmune anti-influenza immunoglobulin did show virological benefit on day 3 and 5, although, as previously noted, did not show clinical benefit for the primary analysis population. 11 At present, the FDA does not consider virological endpoints alone to be sufficient as primary endpoints given the absense of a predictive relationship between reductions in viral titres and clinical benefit, as well as substantial variability in methods of quantifying viral shedding. 14 The use of haemagglutination inhibition titre as a measure of immunity in the prevention of influenza is well established, 15 and therefore an increase in haemagglutination inhibition titres by immune plasma might be anticipated to decrease viral shedding. Additionally, several hundred units of plasma were screened each week to support this study, so the assay needed to be scalable for high throughput. For these reasons, plasma units for this study were screened by haemagglutination inhibition. However, in the previous cohort study, 2 anti-influenza convalescent plasma units were screened by neutralising antibody titre. Although neutralising antibody titre and haemagglutination inhibition are generally related, there are not sufficient data to indicate which is the more appropriate method for screening plasma units. Additionally, it is possible that systemically administered antibodies do not sufficiently permeate mucosal surfaces to affect viral replication. In our study, there was a numerical difference in geometric mean titres in the plasma treatment group compared with participants in the control group in the first few days after plasma administration. The analysis of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship of this intervention, however, presents several challenges. The administered plasma is not discernable from the intrinsic immune response. Unlike small molecules, the baseline titre does not begin at zero due to both pre-existing immunity (previous infections and vaccinations) as well as any immune response occurring after the illness onset. By day 28, the titre is higher in all participants regardless of treatment due to the adaptive immune response and remains elevated above baseline for months. Given the complexity of this type of analysis, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship is beyond the scope of this Article.",

Potential placebos (eg, saline with albumin) were debated during protocol development, although even with elaborate blinding schemes the study team is unlikely to have been effectively blinded. Ultimately, it was concluded that incorporation of a placebo should await a larger, more definitive trial. One unintended consequence of the decision to have an unblinded study design was the observation that losses to follow-up seemed to be somewhat higher in the participants who received standard care as compared with those who received plasma. After consenting but then being informed that no specific study treatment would be provided, we suspect that participants who received standard care were less motivated to complete all study visits.

Major challenges included a low incidence of influenza illness in some years of the study and the scarcity of experience of most blood establishments with using plasma as an investigational product. Some participants, families, and even treating physicians also expressed reluctance in use of a human blood product for a disease such as influenza, in which morbidity and mortality is often underappreciated. There were additional challenges unique to the investigational product, including the moving target of antigenic drift in circulating influenza subtypes and the need to match this evolution over time with contemporaneous plasma, and the comparatively short shelf life of plasma units necessitating frequent replenishment of expiring units.",
