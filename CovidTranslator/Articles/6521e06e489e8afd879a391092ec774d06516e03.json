An analysis was performed on a subset of HLA-A2+ subjects to test whether CD8+ T cells specific to HPV 16, 18, 6 and 11 were increased in response to amolimogene immunization. Of the 21 subjects receiving amolimogene, 11 had elevated CD8+ T cell responses to HPV 16 and/or 18 peptides and seven of these also had increases to corresponding HPV 6 and/or 11 peptides. In addition, T cells primed and expanded in vitro with an HPV 18 peptide demonstrated cross-reactivity to the corresponding HPV 11 peptide. These data demonstrate that treatment with amolimogene elicits T cell responses to HPV 16, 18, 6 and 11.",

            "text": "Human papilloma virus (HPV) infections are recognized as a primary risk factor in the development of cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer [1] [2] [3] [4] . Over 30 different genetic subtypes of the virus have been associated with the disease progression, but most of high-grade dysplasia and cervical cancers are associated with a subset of ''high risk'' viral types; the most frequent being type 16 and type 18 and their closely related subtypes [3, 5, 6] . While the majority of HPV infections are cleared by the host, the probability of developing progressive disease is significantly increased in patients with moderately suppressed immune systems [2] [3] [4] . Therapeutic vaccination targeted towards viral antigens has been investigated as a means to enhance the host immune response to HPV and lead to disease resolution. This type of approach could be considered as an alternative to the surgical procedures that are currently used as standard of care [7] . HPV contains a double stranded circular DNA genome encoding six early expressing genes (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6 and E7) and two late expressing genes (L1 and L2). The L1 and L2 proteins form the viral capsid and are expressed late in infection [8] . The E1 and E2 viral proteins are required for viral DNA replication, while the E4 and E5 proteins are for virus assembly and ampli-fication of the viral genome in the upper layers of the epithelium [9] . The E6 and E7 proteins of high-risk HPV are involved in disregulation of the cell cycle and therefore are oncogenic [10] . The E6 viral protein interacts with an E6-AP to target the p53 protein for degradation [11] , whereas the E7 protein interferes with the normal function of the retinoblastoma protein [12] . Collectively, E6 and E7 disrupt the normal cell cycle checkpoint processes. As both proteins are required to maintain the transformed state, E6 and E7 represent potential anti-viral therapeutic drug targets.",

The percentage of global population that develop these warts is somewhere in the range of 0.5-1%, with approximately one million new cases each year in the United States [13] . Over 90% of HPV infections resulting in anogenital warts are caused by HPV types 6 and 11. Although most individuals who contract the virus will clear the infection or remain asymptomatic, a number of people will develop condylomas. Anogenital warts are not life threatening however, there is a negative physical and mental impact on those affected with the disease. Since disease resolution is dependent upon cell mediated immune responses, a therapeutic vaccine that can prime and expand HPV 6 and 11 specific T-cells may be a useful treatment option for patients with the disease.",

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.cellimm.2011.04.005 the clinic as a treatment for high grade cervical dysplasia. Amolimogene consists of a plasmid DNA (pDNA) vector that is encapsulated within poly-lactide co-glycolide (PLG) microparticles ($2 micron mean diameter). Microparticle encapsulation increases the stability of the pDNA vaccine within the host by protecting the pDNA from enzymatic cleavage [14] [15] [16] [17] . Once injected into the host, the particulate nature of the formulation will cause local inflammation to occur and the resulting influx of antigen presenting cells (APC) will phagocytose the microparticles [18] . The plasmid will then be released inside the activated APC resulting in direct transfection of professional antigen presenting cells that can express the HPV epitopes, in the context of MHC class I and II molecules, leading to T cell priming and expansion. Amolimogene has been tested for safety and efficacy in a randomized, doubleblind, placebo controlled Phase II clinical trial in patients with high-grade cervical dysplasia [19] . The results demonstrated a favorable safety profile and, in a prospectively defined sub group of women under 25 years, clinical resolution of disease was significantly higher in amolimogene treated individuals compared to the placebo control group (70% versus 23%). It is of interest that although amolimogene comprises HPV 16 and 18 sequences, it was observed that resolution of lesions could occur in women with alternate (non 16 or 18) HPV subtypes.",

We used the IFN-c ELISpot as a method to detect peripheral T cell activity in HLA-A2+ subjects following treatment with amolimogene or placebo control. The ELISpot assay has the ability to detect low frequency, antigen specific T-cells in the peripheral blood [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . The work reported here was performed to test whether T cells specific to HPV 16 and 18 were induced by amolimogene immunization, as well as determine if increased levels of T cells specific for non 16/18 subtypes (HPV 6 and 11) were present in the peripheral blood of the patient cohort after immunization. An additional objective of our study was to explore whether T cell clones specific to an HPV 18 peptide can recognize and respond to target cells presenting the corresponding HPV 11 peptide. Although not evaluated in this study, the presence of higher levels of T cells with specificity for alternate HPV subtypes may help to explain the clinical observation of resolution of disease in women with non 16 and 18 HPV subtypes. Together, these efforts may provide the framework for future studies exploring the diversity and/or cross reactive nature of the T cell response after amolimogene immunization.",

There was variation in the magnitude of response to the peptides among subjects however, there was consistency in the timepoint at which most responses were detected in that the strongest responses were detected at week 14 [8 weeks post the third (final) immunization]. By week 26, most effector T cell responses had decreased to levels that were near their baseline (week 0) responses.

It is not entirely clear why we did not observe increased T cell responses in 10/21 subjects that received amolimogene. Potential explanations are insufficient dose to prime and expand a measurable response, and/or in-correct blood collection timepoints.

            "text": "tion. Subject T cells were tested for their ability to recognize and respond to peptides from HPV 6 and 11, the HPV types associated with genital warts. HPV 6 or 11 peptides were selected based on several criteria, one of which included a predictive algorithm that selected peptides based on sequence homology at the P4, P5, P6 and P7 positions. Each HPV 6 or 11 nonomer peptide had as few as one and as many as six amino acid substitutions. Increases in T cell responses to HPV 6 and/or 11 were detected in 7 of 21 subjects that had received amolimogene. As was the case in the responses to the HPV 16/18 peptides, most responses to the HPV 6/ 11 peptides peaked at week 14 and were reduced at the week 26 timepoint. These data offer evidence that amolimogene immunization can yield increases in CD8+ T cells with specificity for HPV 6 and 11 subtypes. As previously mentioned, we observed increases in HPV 16/18 T-cell responses at week 14 and 26 in one placebo control subject. Interestingly, the T cell response to the corresponding HPV 6/11 peptide in this patient did not increase over time, resulting in 70, 90 and 10 SFC at weeks 0, 14 and 26, respectively. As shown in Table 3 , a correlation exists between T cells generated to HPV 16/18 peptides and HPV 6/11 peptides. In most cases (7/11 subjects), when there was a detectable increase in T cell responses to HPV 16 and/or 18 peptides, there was also an increase to the corresponding HPV 6 and/or 11 peptides. This correlation suggests that the same T cell clones that are induced by amolimogene immunization are responding to two different, but homologous, peptides. The one exception was subject #21. This subject had a history of genital warts which may explain why there were detectable responses to the HPV 6b E6 TIDQLCKTF peptide (60 SFC at Week 14) with no corresponding response to the HPV 16 E6 KLPQLCTEL (0 SFC at Week 14) or HPV 18 E6 KLPDLCTEL (10 SFC at Week 14) peptides. Also shown in Table 3 is whether the subjects experienced resolution of their disease. We did not observe a correlation between induction of peripheral HPV immune responses to the peptides selected for this study and CIN II/III resolution. It has been previously reported that patients with CIN III have measurable CTL responses to HPV 16 antigens but do not clear their disease [33] . One potential explanation for this observation is that regulatory T cells could have interfered with or suppressed the effector T cells from effectively targeting the dysplastic tissue. It is known that regulatory T cells are present in and play a key role in HPV associated cervical lesions (persistence and progression to carcinoma) [34, 35] . Our analysis on this small number of trial subjects was not designed to further explore this observation but rather to study the induction of HPV T cell responses and their cross reactive properties following immunization with amolimogene.",

            "text": "The results of this study indicated that amolimogene can induce T cell responses to multiple T cell epitopes, a phenomenon that has been well documented with other DNA vaccines [36] [37] [38] . Enhanced CD8+ T cell responses were detected at week 14 (8 weeks after final immunization) to multiple HLA-A2 restricted peptides from HPV 16 and 18. Not only were the CD8+ T cell responses directed towards HPV 16 and 18, they were also reactive with peptides from HPV 6 and 11 that had sequence homology. Based on our data set from the clinical trial subjects it is not clear if the responses we detected were generated from HPV 16/18 specific CD8+ T cells that were cross reacting to HPV 6/11 epitopes, or by distinct CD8+ T cell populations that are specific to unique epitopes from HPV 16/18 and 6/11. We initiated experiments to test whether a T cell line specific for an HPV 18 epitope, encoded by the amolimogene pDNA construct, could react to an HPV 11 epitope with similar sequence homology. The results from this demonstrate that T cell lines primed to a single HPV 18 peptide can recognize and respond to an epitope from HPV 11. This offers evidence that suggests the peripheral blood HPV 16/18 T cells that are expanded by amolimogene immunization are capable of cross reacting to HPV 6/11 epitopes. Other studies have examined cross reactivity in mouse and man. Kreijtz et al. [39] demonstrated a considerable ability of seasonal CTL specific to the H3N2 influenza virus to recognize epitopes from the avian H5N1 influenza virus. This observation is important when assessing the potential impact of a pandemic outbreak caused by H5N1, and suggests that the presence of these cross reactive CTL may benefit the general population. In another study, Nilges et al. [40] , showed that CTL reactive to the HPV16 E7 11\u00c019/20 epitope, TMDLQPET, would also recognize the HLA-A2 peptide from the human coronavirus NS2. The peptides have 66% sequence homology and the data support the notion that cross reactive CD8+ T cells can recognize immunogenic regions of HPV16 as well as regions of a common pathogen. In work performed by McCarthy and colleagues [41] , the authors show that immunization of HLA-A2/K b transgenic mice with HPV 18 and 45 E6 DNA yields cross reactive T-cells that recognize other related HPV types. Finally, the work reported by Williams et al. [42] , demonstrate CD4+ T cell lines, specific to HPV 11 L1, generated from 21 unrelated healthy donors have the ability to recognize and respond to alternate HPV types. Our observations of CD8+ T cells capable of cross reactivity offer a potential explanation of how amolimogene induced HPV 16/18 specific T cells could recognize peptide epitopes from other HPV strains.",

Enhancing the number of functional T cells specific to HPV 16, 18, 6 and 11 epitopes within the host may provide a clinical benefit for patients with HPV-mediated diseases. In 21 subjects receiving amolimogene, 11 were found to have a T cell response to the tested HLA-A2 restricted HPV 16/18 peptides at either week 14 or week 26 timepoints that was at least 2-fold greater than the baseline value. Seven of these 11 subjects had increased T cell responses to the tested HLA-A2 restricted HPV 6/11 peptides. The results demonstrate that immunization with amolimogene, an investigational therapeutic vaccine based on HPV 16/18 E6/E7 sequences, elicits T cell responses that also recognize HPV 6/11 epitopes. Furthermore, we showed that a T cell line specific to an HPV 18 peptide can recognize the HPV 11 peptide used in our studies. These data, combined with the clinical observation that disease resolution occurred in women that were not HPV 16 or 18 positive, suggest that additional studies designed to further characterize the ability of amolimogene to induce CD8+ and/or CD4+ T cells that react with other HPV types would be of interest.",

Values represent IFN-c ELISpot responses to HLA-A2 restricted HPV peptides (all HPV 16 and 18 peptides are encoded by the amolimogene pDNA construct). A: peptide set #1. B: peptide set #2. C: peptide set #3. Timepoints tested include week 0 (pre-injection baseline), week 14 (8 weeks post final injection) and week 26 (20 weeks post final injection). Values are reported as IFN-c spot forming cells (SFC) per 10e6 CD8+ T-cells. Positive responses are highlighted and defined as greater than or equal to 50 SFC and at least 2-fold greater than the Wk 0 timepoint. Assays were set up in batch format to minimize variability (i.e. wk 0, wk 14 and wk 26 samples from each subject were evaluated on the same day in the same assay plate by the same operator).",
