These fivemembered heterocyclic motifs with three nitrogen heteroatoms can be prepared easily using 'click' chemistry with copper-or ruthenium-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reactions. Recently, the 'linker' property of 1,2,3-triazoles was demonstrated, and a novel class of 1,2,3-triazole-containing hybrids and conjugates was synthesised and evaluated as lead compounds for diverse biological targets. These lead compounds have been demonstrated as anticancer, antimicrobial, anti-tubercular, antiviral, antidiabetic, antimalarial, anti-leishmanial, and neuroprotective agents. The present review summarises advances in lead compounds of 1,2,3-triazolecontaining hybrids, conjugates, and their related heterocycles in medicinal chemistry published in 2018. This review will be useful to scientists in research fields of organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, phytochemistry, and pharmacology.",

The nitrogen-containing azole skeleton offers the advantage of two nitrogen heteroatoms in the ring, which has an important effect on structural modifications and biological interactions. Over the past decade, the chemistry and biology of azole derivatives have emerged as very popular topics. We performed a search of the Scopus database (31 December 2018) using each of the azoles ('imidazole', 'pyrazole', 'triazole', 'tetrazole', and 'pentazole') as keywords to identify different published reports, and found that triazole motifs were the most frequently studied (Fig. 1) , 15 particularly 1,2,3triazoles.",

Moreover, triazole-linked derivatives were suggested to affect adenosine diphosphate ribosylation biology, 34 and were used widely in peptides to mimic a trans-amide bond, despite their hazardous effects on native peptide activity. 35 In addition, a 1,2,3-triazole core provides diverse pharmacophore properties and hybrids are most commonly considered 'lead compounds' when they contain or are fused by a 1,2,3-triazole ring. Thus, in view of the above factors and the recent focus of researchers on 1,2,3triazole compounds, we have discussed and highlighted the diverse biological activities of the 1,2,3-triazole hybrids, conjugates, and their related compounds as leads in medicinal chemistry, based on articles published in 2018.",

The target lead (6, Fig. 3 ) showed significant activity on HCT116 cells (IC 50 = 5.19 \u00b5M). Moreover, this triterpene saponin triazole derivative demonstrated favourable selectivity, and was effective on multidrug resistance (MDR) cancer cells where it induced ferroptosis and apoptosis as a p53 activator via the mitochondrial pathway. In vivo investigations revealed that the introduction of the triazole fragment into the triterpene skeleton considerably inhibited tumorigenesis without causing toxicity against normal cells (for 6). Indeed, this study provided clinical evidence to support the consideration of the albiziabioside A derivative 6 as a potential cancer drug candidate with enhanced activity, and further information on its novel mechanism of action. Another series of 1,2,3-triazole-linked saponin hederacolchiside A 1 with aryl/amide portion were synthesised to improve the inhibitory activity, metabolic stability, and comprehensively determine the pharmacological mechanism. 51 The antiproliferative activities of the synthesised analogues were assayed on six types of human cancer cell lines, PC3, HT29, HepG2, A549, HL60, and U937 cell lines. The results revealed that most of the synthesised hybrids with the para-and meta-substituents demonstrated strong cytotoxicity towards HL60 and U937 cells. In particular, derivative 7 ( Fig. 3) showed strong anticancer potential against all selected cells compare with the positive controls 5-fluorouracil and hederacolchiside A 1 . Moreover, the results of the cell cycle and apoptosis screening indicated that 7 clearly inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells via the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of the in the G1 and S phases. Biologically relevant natural, synthetic, and hybrid compounds are a great resource for lead formation and the development of novel pharmaceuticals. Recently, 60 novel 1,2,3-triazole-containing pharmacophores related to the allogibberic acid fragments were synthesised by Wu et al. 52 The cytotoxic potential of all hybrid allogibberic triazole hybrids was tested to determine their anticancer activities on the A-549, HL-60, SMMC-7721, MCF-7, and SW480 cell lines. The most potent compound (8, Fig. 3 ) demonstrated satisfactorily higher cytotoxicity than the positive control drug cisplatin did towards all five tested tumour cell lines, with IC 50 values of 0.25-1.70 \u00b5M.

This triazole hybrid induced apoptosis and was strongly cytotoxic to BL2, RS4;11, and H929 cells at rates of 93, 75.5, and 37.5, and 20.5%, respectively in Remb1 cells. 54 Here, it should be noted that the selected target proteins such as Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bcl-xL), myeloid cell leukaemia 1 (Mcl-1), and Bcl-2 and their interaction between new triazole hybrids were screened using fluorescence polarisation, and the results indicated that modulation of the lateral chain dramatically affected the compound by considerably modifying its activity on target proteins. Other triazole-natural compound hybrids, triterpene derivative-linked 1,2,3-triazole moieties were prepared and their anticancer potentials were investigated on the selected cancer cells such as C-32, T47D, and SNB-19 using the WST-1 assay. 55 Hybrid derivative 11 (Fig. 3 ) displayed a significant IC 50 value (0.17 \u00b5M) toward the human glioblastoma SNB-19 cell line, which was nearly 5-fold higher that the value of the reference drug cisplatin.

Docking simulations of the lead compounds, including 17, into the active ATPbinding site of various epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinases was conducted and the interaction of H-bonds of the 1,2,3-triazole fragment and the dense hydrophobisation of di-oxygenated portion of quinazolines with the remnants in the ATP pocket, was a major points in EGFR binding. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-\u03b3-specific properties of 1,4substituted 1,2,3-triazolo-quinazolinones has been investigated via in in vitro cytotoxicity test against several cancer cell lines (HL-60, Colo-205, HCT-116, MCF-7, and A549 cells). 62 Two compounds (18 and 19, Fig. 4 ) demonstrated less toxicity against HL-60 cells (IC 50 = 1 \u00b5M) than the other compounds did. The specificity of compounds 18 and 19 against various isoforms of PI3-Ks was examined using western blotting and they exhibited selectivity against PI3K\u03b3 isoforms, with IC 50 values of 1 and 3 \u00b5M, respectively.",

[1 2 0] and evaluated for anti-leishmanial potential. 120 Notably, hybrid 90 (Fig. 11 ) demonstrated nanomolar activity against Leishmania major promastigotes (IC 50 = 140.3 nM), while against axenic amastigotes, the IC 50 value was 1 \u00b5M, indicating an 8-fold higher activity than that of miltefosine.

A 4-(3-(4-allyl-2methoxyphenoxy)propyl)-1-(4-methylbenzyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole (91, Fig. 11 ) was found to be more active (IC 50 = 7.4 \u00b5mol L \u22121 ) than the other triazole-linked eugenol derivatives were, which was also assayed in Leishmania parasites peritoneal macrophages (IC 50 = 1.6 \u00b5mol L \u22121 ) and showed effects on cell viability. The cytotoxic potential of 91 on macrophage cells was evidenced by an IC 50 of 211.9 \u00b5mol L \u22121 , while the SI was 132.5. In addition, the triazole derivative 91 demonstrated higher effects than those of pentamidine and glucantime (drugs used clinically).",

Moreover, 119 was evaluated for inhibitory activity on TNFSF11-induced osteoclastogenesis in RAW 264.7 cells. The mechanism of action studies showed that the hybrid derivative 119 displayed dose-dependent inhibition of TNFSF11-induced osteoclastogenesis by suppressing the NF-kB pathway. TNFSF11 stimulation considerably enhanced the phosphorylation of NF-kB (ser 536), IkB\u03b1 (ser 32), and IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 (ser 176/180), while the lead compound, 119, dose-dependently (2.5, 5, and 10 \u00b5M) decreased their phosphorylation. Yu et al. 147 reported the activity of a modified 1,2,3-triazole-linked P2Y 14 R antagonist for the reduction of inflammation. It was observed that compound 112 exhibited the most potent antagonists properties (Fig. 15 ) in the fluorescent assay, and 112 has three CH 2 chains between two amines tethered to the thiophene ring via an amide linker.",

Results showed that compound 134 (Fig. 21 ) specifically targets Na,K-ATPase \u03b14. The activity of the lead derivative 134 was determined in rat sperm Vm, pH, and [Ca 2+ ] i . The prepared cell samples were treated in the presence and absence of 10 \u22128 M 134 for 1 h, and sperm Vm, pH, and [Ca 2+ ] i were measured using various fluorophores and derivative 134 caused sperm plasma membrane depolarisation, escalating Vm by almost 40%, causing intracellular sperm acidification. Overall, except for the decreased ability of sperm to swim and reach the egg, 134 demonstrated decreased hyperactivity of sperm movability. All the above potential activities of 134 could serve in the future development of drug candidates for male contraception.",

            "text": "In conclusion, lead compounds containing the 1,2,3-triazole moiety will serve as effective drug candidates in their current forms or following appropriate chemical and biological modifications in future. Indeed, the developments in Cu-AAC have generated 1,2,3-triazolehybrids with a broad profile of activities. The present review shows that most synthesised triazoles have favoured activities in which these motifs not only acted as a linker, showing CH-\u03c0 interaction between the 1,2,3-triazole and enzymes, but also directed the appropriate side-rings (the fused ring in the triazole hybrid system) to the binding sites of enzymes or amino acids. These properties of triazoles in the hybrid molecules make them a unique motif that is an important factor in drug design and delivery. Although the selectivity and solubility of the most common triazole-hybrids have been well improved, the in vivo assay results indicate that further developments are needed. There should also be a focus on fused 1,2,3-triazole heterocyclic compounds, because triazole linkers have been well studied and their mechanism of action is clear. For example, we propose that if a 1,2,3-triazole ring was inserted instead of the imidazole portion in the purine skeleton, this type of fused pyrimidines may exhibit interesting properties for medicinal chemistry. In addition, the present review indicated that a proportion of studies have been dedicated to coumarin modification using Cu-AAC method. In the future, we believe there will be further elucidation of 1,2,3-triazole chemistry and biology, which would facilitate the development of 1,2,3-triazole-based lead compounds with lower toxicity and higher selectivity.",
