Synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. The results indicated that, compounds 5c and 5i exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity. Compound 5f was found to be the most potent antifungal agent. The structure activity relationship revealed that the presence of electron withdrawing groups at para position of phenyl ring remarkably enhanced the antibacterial activity of synthesized compounds. Further, the results of preliminary MTT cytotoxicity studies on HeLa cells suggested that potent antimicrobial activity of 5b, 5c, 5f, 5h and 5i is accompanied by low cytotoxicity.",

Despite the availability of a large number of antibiotics and chemotherapeutics, the increasing clinical importance of drug-resistant microbial pathogens have lent additional urgency in microbiological and antifungal research [1e4] . A potential solution to the antibiotic resistance is to design and explore innovative heterocyclic agents with novel mode of actions. In this context, thiazole derivatives have been playing a crucial role in medicinal chemistry. Thiazole nucleus constitutes an integral part of all the available penicillins, which have transformed the bacterial diseases therapy [5] . They display quite a broad spectrum of biological activities [6] , which have found applications in the treatment of allergies [7] , hypertension [8] , inflammation [9] , schizophrenia [10] , microbial infections [11, 12] , HIV infections [13] , hypnotics [14] and pain [15] . They are also used as new inhibitors of bacterial DNA gyrase B [16] . Further, thiazoles have emerged as new class of potent antimicrobial agents, which are reported to inhibit bacteria by blocking the biosynthesis of certain bacterial lipids and/ or by additional mechanisms [17, 18] .",

Potent pharmacological activity of 1,3,4-oxadiazoles can be attributed to the presence of toxophoric eN]CeOe linkage which may react with the nucleophilic centers of the microbial cell [20] . Further, the widespread use of 1,3,4-oxadiazoles as a scaffold in medicinal chemistry established this moiety as a member of the privileged structures class and its derivatives have exhibited a wide range of biological activities such as antibacterial [21] , antitubercular [22] , vasodialatory [23] , antifungal [24] , cytotoxic [25] , anti-inflammatory and analgesic [26, 27] , hypolipidemic [28] , anticancer [29] and ulcerogenic [30] . Oxadiazole derivatives have been found to possess broad spectrum antimicrobial activity and therefore are useful substructures for further molecular exploration [30] . The most prominent examples of prescribed agents featuring the 1,3,4-oxadiazoles nucleus include the antiretroviral raltegravir [31] , antihypertensive nesapidil [32] and the antibiotic furamizole [33] (Fig. 1) .",

The intermediate obtained thus, was refluxed with carbon disulfide in the presence of potassium hydroxide in ethanol (99.5%) to yield intermediate N-(4-methyl-5-(5-thioxo-4,5-dihydro-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2yl)thiazol-2-yl)acetamide (4) . Mannich condensation of intermediate 4 with 36% formaldehyde and an appropriately substituted aniline derivative in ethanol (99.5%) furnished the desired compounds 5ael. Both analytical and spectral data of the synthesized compounds 5ael were fully in agreement with proposed structures.",

The results of the antimicrobial studies are presented in Table 1 . In general, compounds 5ael demonstrated better antibacterial activity than antifungal activity. Compounds 5c and 5i emerged as the most effective antibacterial agents with 2-to 4-fold higher MIC (12.5e25 mg/mL) than the reference drug chloramphenicol. While, compounds 5b and 5h exhibited comparable antibacterial activity with the standard drug. From the results of the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds 5ael, the following structure activity relationships can be derived: the antibacterial activity was considerably affected by substitution pattern on the phenyl ring and the most active compounds contain electron withdrawing substituent at para and meta positions of the phenyl ring (p > m > o). In contrast, the presence of electron releasing groups on the phenyl ring witnessed a substantial decrease in antibacterial activity for compounds 5def and 5kel. The role of electron withdrawing group in improving antimicrobial activity is very well supported by previous studies [41, 42] . Compounds 5c and 5i, substituted with inductively electron withdrawing fluoro and nitro groups, respectively at para position showed the highest antibacterial activity (F > NO 2 ). It is a very well-known fact that electron withdrawing substitution such as fluoro/nitro at the para position of the aromatic ring increases the lipophilicity of molecules. This property is directly related to antimicrobial activity as it facilitates a compound to diffuse through the biological membranes and reach to its site of action. The presence of lipophilic substituent at para position of phenyl ring provided a positive influence on antibacterial activity. On the other hand, presence of the same functional groups at meta position resulted in slight decrease in the antibacterial activity (5b and 5h) but, still produced significant inhibitory action compared to the standard drug chloramphenicol (F > NO 2 ). While, substituting the phenyl ring with fluoro and nitro group at ortho position resulted in noticeable decrease in the antibacterial activity of compounds 5a and 5g respectively. On the basis of MIC values, it may be concluded that electron withdrawing atom/group such as fluoro and nitro at the para position of phenyl ring induced a positive effect while electron donating groups such as methyl and methoxy induced a negative effect on antibacterial activity of compounds 5ael.",

The enhanced activity of compound 5f may be attributed to the presence of electron releasing group at para position. The contrasting nature of substitution pattern at para position of the phenyl ring of most active antibacterial and antifungal agents indicate that the structural requirements are different for binding of drug to bacterial or fungal targets, respectively [43] .

The potent antimicrobial activity of most active compounds 5b, 5c, 5f, 5h and 5i were accompanied with relatively low level of cytotoxicity.
