Methods: Women's health and disease news articles were collated from a popular news website between 1993 to 2015 and preprocessed using gynecological medical terminology, Korean words and nouns (excluding general nouns not related to women's healthcare topics). The resultant articles (N = 7,710) were analyzed using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm and major topics were extracted. Topic trends were analyzed by year and period for women's health. Results: It was observed that most of the women's health articles were focused on \"Healthcare\", and 9 other topics were identified that represented a relatively small proportion in",

The concept of framing is related to the *Corresponding author: Young Woon Woo agenda-setting tradition but expands the research by focusing on the essence of the issues at hand rather than on a particular topic. The basis of framing theory is that the media focuses attention on certain events and then places them within a field of meaning.

In 2013, depression and mental health coverage in the media were analyzed [5] and factors involved in the stigma of suicide prevention were studied [6] .",

Second, general nouns not related to women's healthcare topics, were removed.) so that the analysis of the results in Step 3 could be accurately derived.
