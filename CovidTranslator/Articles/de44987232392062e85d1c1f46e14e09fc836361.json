The C-terminal domain of SeMV polyprotein 2a was cloned, expressed and purified in order to functionally characterize it. The protein of size 8 kDa (P8) domain, like viral protein genome linked (VPg), was found to be natively unfolded and could bind to nucleic acids. Interestingly, P10-P8 but not P8 showed a novel Mg 2+ dependent ATPase activity that was inhibited in the presence of poly A. In the absence of P8, the ATPase activity of the protein of size 10 kDa (P10) domain was reduced suggesting that the natively unfolded P8 domain influenced the P10 ATPase.",

            "text": "Sesbania mosaic virus (SeMV) is a sobemovirus that contains 4149 nucleotides long RNA genome with a viral protein genome linked (VPg) attached to its 5 0 end [1] . Of the four open reading frames (ORFs), the two central ORFs 2a and 2b are translated into polyproteins. ORF 2a codes for polyprotein 2a with a domain arrangement of membrane anchor-serine protease-VPg-P10-P8 (Fig. 1a) [2] . ORF 2b is translated by \u00c01 ribosomal frameshifting into polyprotein 2ab (MA-protease-VPg-RNA dependent RNA polymerase). The N-terminal serine protease domain was shown to be responsible for the processing of the polyproteins into functional domains [2, 3] . Our recent study demonstrated that the removal of membrane anchor via the cleavage at E132-S133, is essential for the cleavage at E498-S499 site between protein of size 10 kDa (P10) and protein of size 8 kDa (P8) domains [2] .",

Together, these findings suggest that region at the C-terminus of VPg in the polyprotein may play an essential role in the viral life cycle. For example, it is possible that polyprotein 2a could bind to the gRNA via C-terminal P8 RNA binding domain that might aid in correctly positioning the natively unfolded VPg to get uridinylated by RdRp, following which the P10-P8 domain could get cleaved off. Further studies need to be carried out to establish any such possibility. In 40% of the RNA binding proteins, the RNA binding sites overlap with the nuclear localization signal (NLS). Prediction shows that P8 may have a bipartite NLS (data not shown). It would be interesting to see if P8 or its precursors could enter the nucleus of the host cell and act as transcriptional regulators.",

Since energy requirement is an essential prerequisite in these processes, it was of interest to see if P8 could provide for the same by hydrolyzing ATP. The ATPase assay was performed with the purified P8 protein as described in Section 2. As seen in Fig. 3a , when increasing amounts of protein (0-0.8 lg) was incubated with c-32 P ATP, no 32 Pi release was observed, suggesting that P8 was devoid of ATPase activity (Fig. 3a, lanes 1-4) . On the other hand 0.5 lg calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase used as positive control showed release of 32 Pi (Fig. 3a, lane 5) .",

The protein was expressed and purified as described in Section 2 (Fig. 1c, lane 3) . Purified His tagged P18 also showed mass abnormality (25 kDa instead of 19 kDa). When increasing amounts of protein (0-0.8 lg) was incubated with c-32 P ATP, a dose dependent increase in the release of 32 Pi was observed (Fig. 3b) . Further, as seen in Fig. 3c , lane 2, P18 immunodepleted with anti P8 antibodies showed no release of 32 Pi as against the control P18 (Fig. 3c, lane 1) , confirming that the ATPase activity was inherent to P18. Most of the viral ATPases are known to be stimulated by nucleic acids [13, 14] . Therefore ATPase assay with P18 was carried out in the absence and presence of poly A (0.5 mg/ ml). As seen in Fig. 3d , P18 ATPase was substantially inhibited in the presence of poly A. A similar kind of inhibition was also reported for the ATPase activity of Human coronavirus 229E nsp13 and poliovirus protein 2C, though the reason for the inhibition was unclear [15, 16] . The inhibition of P18 ATPase by poly A could be due to the binding of poly A to P8 domain. Since, gRNA incubated with P10 did not show any retardation in EMSA (data not shown), it is unlikely that P10 could be involved in such an inhibition by poly A.",

The region corresponding to P10 was cloned in pRSET C vector, expressed and purified as described in Section 2. Fig. 1c , lane 4 shows the purified P10 protein. As seen in Fig. 5a with increasing amounts of the P10 (0-0.8 lg), a dose dependent increase in the release of 32 Pi was seen suggesting that unlike P8, P10 alone could hydrolyze ATP. The ATPase activity of P18 and P10 was performed with increasing concentrations of ATP. The Lineweaver-Burk plot (1/v vs 1/[ATP]) was obtained (Fig. 5b ) and the kinetic parameters were calculated. The Km for P18 and P10 was 90.9 lM and 27.7 lM and V max was 4.29 and 1.71 pmol/min/ lg, respectively. k cat for P18 and P10 was 0.0815 and 0.0188 min \u00c01 , respectively. In the presence of P8 domain, there was an increase in the k cat of P10 ATPase by 4.3-fold, V max by 2.5-fold and K m by threefold. In other words, the ATPase activity of P10 domain was influenced by the natively unfolded P8 domain. Interestingly, in SeMV, the serine protease domain is also rendered active by VPg, yet another natively unfolded domain present at its C-terminus [9] . More intriguing is the fact that, like VPg P8 is also present at the C-terminus of P10. However, VPg present at the N-terminus of RdRp has been shown to have inhibitory effect on the in vitro polymerase activity of the later (unpublished observations). The alternating arrangement of folded and unfolded domains in SeMV polyprotein 2a, therefore appears to be a strategy operating to regulate the activities of the domains.",
