            "text": "Hotel business in Hong Kong has been badly affected by the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) since March 2003. Medical reports suggest that a direct contact with the secretion or respiratory droplets from a patient through a short distance is very likely to be the possible way of transmitting the disease. World Health Organization (WHO), hence, has advised international travellers to avoid visiting several regions that have the most number of SARS cases, including Hong Kong. Since then, the number of hotel guests has largely dropped to a level that Hong Kong has never experienced before. As a totally new experience to the hotel industry in Hong Kong and elsewhere, hoteliers basically do not have enough knowledge to respond to epidemic crisis. In view of the lack of published articles in the hospitality literature that examine the issue, this paper investigates the impact of the SARS outbreak on the hotel industry in Hong Kong. In addition, this paper addresses the issue of SARS crisis management in risk identification, assessment and alleviation. The paper is expected to benefit the entire hotel industry from better understanding and planning to face the mysterious illness. r",

As at mid-April, the illness has inflected more than 3000 people in many countries worldwide (WHO, 2003a) . In Hong Kong, the original source of the SARS outbreak was traced back to a local hotel in which an infected guest from Southern China who stayed in the hotel in late-February 2003 was known to be the carrier (Chow, 2003; Saywell and Murphy, 2003) . Six other non-local guests in the same hotel were then contracted with SARS and these people further spread the disease to other countries including Singapore and Vietnam, and later to other parts of the world (BBC News, 2003a) .",

Such an easy access, unfortunately, acts as the catalyst for fast and broad SARS infection. According to WHO, Hong Kong is the second most severely affected area (WHO, 2003b) . In Hong Kong, there were a total of 1543 contracted cases and 133 deaths as at April 27, 2003 (DH, 2003a . Moreover, it is unlikely that these numbers will become zero in a short time.

Having faced with an 80% decrease in tourist bookings, a leading Hong Kong-based travel agency warned that many travel and tourism firms could be driven out of business soon unless the industry receives substantial government aid (BBC News, 2003b) . Similarly, JPMorgan, an American financial services company, estimated that the economic growth in Hong Kong could be reduced up to 6% as long as the SARS outbreak continues (Fowler, 2003) . Basically, the increasing number of personal bankruptcy cases can serve as an indicator for the current economic situation. In March 2003, 3199 people in Hong Kong declared bankruptcy, representing an increase of 18.1% from the previous month. The number of personal and bankruptcy cases may go up even higher if the SARS epidemic is not contained. The Hong Kong Government also admits that the SARS outbreak will slow down the economic growth in 2003 and has thus abandoned its original goal of a 3% increase (BBC News, 2003b) .",

However, due to the large decrease in tourist arrivals, the occupancy rates of many hotels in Hong Kong fell to 10% or lower in March and April 2003 (Li, 2003a) . In other words, what the hoteliers have to deal with, instead of how to raise room rates, is how to handle a large scale of cancellations. A natural outcome of such a large drop in occupancy rate is the actions to reduce costs, defer promotions that involved overseas travel, and avoid non-essential capital expenses. Examples of these actions include closing of floors and suspension of food and beverage services in response to the slump. Some hotel even simply chose to temporary close their properties because profits made from these hotels were not enough to cover electricity, water, and gas charges (Li, 2003b) . Five of the 81 hotels on the Hong Kong Hotels Association membership list were even put up for sale when occupancy was badly affected by the SARS outbreak (Wong, 2003) . These business decisions, inevitably, lead to massive forced pay cuts and definite or indefinite no-pay leave. As a whole, hoteliers still do not know where they will be heading if the SARS crisis continues. While the Hong Kong Government is working on setting up control policies and preparing for recovery plans, hoteliers in Hong Kong, and probably hoteliers in general, should be aware of and well prepared for preventing a SARS outbreak in their hotels.",

These measures should include, but not limited to, screening of suspected patients, provision of surgical masks, additional cleaning of air outlets and ventilation ducts, and keep contracted areas in quarantine. In addition, hotel staff should be frequently advised to take necessary precautions to reduce any chance of being infected. Building up a good immune system, and wearing masks at work would help achieving such a goal. If a hotel staff member has any symptoms of suspected infection, the staff member ought to refrain from work, and job substitution should be arranged accordingly. At the same time, hotel staffs have to report any suspected cases from customers.",

Examples of these policies include the consideration of whether customers are required to wear masks in the hotel or whether the hotel should accept bookings from travellers who are from the badly infected areas.",

If hotels do not receive assistance from the Government, the survival of the entire industry could be largely threatened, with a possibility of a massive business closure. It is, therefore, suggested that the Government should assist hotels financially. Moreover, hoteliers should work together with the Government to undertake the necessary strategies to restore travellers' confidence and to attract them to return when the SARS outbreak is under control. An example of these confidence-restoring strategies could be the offering of attractive packages that include reduced hotel room rates.",
