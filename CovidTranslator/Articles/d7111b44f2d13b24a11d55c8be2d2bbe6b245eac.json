[2] [3] [4] Human-to-human transmission in hospital and family settings had been accumulating 5-7 and has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019 based on evidence from early transmission dynamics. 8 According to WHO statistics, the accumulating number of diagnosed patients in China was 78,961 in Feb 28, 2020. 9 COVID-19 raised intension not only within China but internationally. Since the first case of pneumonia caused by COVID-19 was reported from Wuhan, COVID-19 patients had rapidly been diagnosed in other cities of China and the neighboring countries including Thailand, South Korea, Japan, and even to a few Western countries. 10-12 On January13 2020, the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand reported the first imported case of lab-confirmed novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 13 As of Feb28 2020, cases had been reported in 52 countries and territories. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases had reached 4,691 outside China, 9 and the number is still increasing. South Korea, the worst affected country outside China, has reported another jump. The 571 new cases brought South Korea's total confirmed cases to 2,337. A surge in cases of COVID-19 in Italy, Japan and Iran also heightened fears that the world is on the brink of a pandemic. 14 In Feb 28, WHO increased the assessment of the risk of spread and risk of impact of COVID-19 to very high at the global level.",

[16] [17] [18] With the limited number of data points and the complexity of the real situation, a straightforward model is expected to work better (see Discussion). In this study, we propose a \"log-plus\" model for the situation prediction which only requires daily number of total diagnosis outside China. This model assumes that there were some unobserved founder patients at the beginning of spread outside China and exponential growth later. Despite the simplicity of our model, it fits the data well (R 2 =0.991). The prediction is expected to provide practical significance on social application and evidence for enhancing public health interventions to avoid severe outbreaks.",
