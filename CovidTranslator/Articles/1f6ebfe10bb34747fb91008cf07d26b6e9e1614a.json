Since the concept of vaccine production in transgenic plants was first introduced by Mason and co-workers in 1992 [16] , the oral immunogenicity of several antigens derived from human and animal pathogens expressed in transgenic plants have been demonstrated [1, 14, 17, 22, 24] . Oral immunization by edible vaccines produced in transgenic plants could stimulate immune responses at the portal entrance of many pathogens, facilitating the design of large-scale immunization programs. The gS from TGEV is an excellent model for developing oral vaccines against enteric pathogens of mammals because of its immunogenicity and resistance to degradation in the gut. Here, we report the expression of recombinant N-terminal domain of gS (N-gS) from TGEV in potato tubers and, more importantly, we demonstrate that transgenic potato tubers fed directly to mice stimulate the systemic production of antibodies against gS. These results contribute to support the feasibility of developing edible vaccines using as vectors transgenic plants expressing immunodominant antigens.",

Desir\u00e9e), as previously described [7] . Briefly, leaf explants from 4-week-old potato plants were infected with recombinant A. tumefaciens (strain LBA4404). The inoculated leaves were blotted dry and placed on solidified shoot-promoting Murashige and Skoog medium [19] supplemented with 30 g of glucose per liter, 6 M zeatin riboside, and 0.02 M naphthalenacetic acid (CM medium). After 2 days of cocultivation, the plants were placed on CM medium supplemented with 300 mg of ticarcillin and 100 mg of kanamycin per liter (CMKT medium). After 3 to 4 weeks, regenerants appeared on CMKT medium at a frequency of 55%. Each leave explant usually gave rise to four or five shoots. Regenerated shoots were subcultured and rooted on selective MS medium supplemented with 10 g of sucrose and 50 mg of kanamycin per liter. The putative transgenic plants were transferred to a sterile peat-perlite (2:1) mixture and incubated in a growth chamber under normal humidity and light conditions. Fifteen different transformed potato clones were obtained by this methodology.",

Enjuanes, Centro Nacional de Biotecnolog\u00eda, CSIC, Spain), recognizing the antigenic sites A and D of the gS, respectively [8] . Results demonstrated that potato tuber extracts from all analyzed plants were positive on ELISA (Fig. 1C ). An experiment performed to quantify the expression of recombinant gS protein expression in the potato tubers, using purified TGEV and different concentrations of transgenic plant extracts in ELISA [13] , showed similar levels of expression in potato tubers that those found in transgenic arabidopsis (0.02-0.07% of total soluble tuber protein). Western blot analyses of the plant extracts with anti-gS antibodies revealed no specific reactions with any protein (data not shown). It could be due to the low levels of recombinant protein expression and to the conformational nature of most of the immunodominant epitopes present in this protein.",

However, when the gene encoding the complete gS was used to transform potato plants, only a few transgenic lines were obtained presenting reduced growth rates compared to control plants or plants transformed with the sequence encoding the N-gS. Therefore, we selected the plants expressing the N-gS for further analyses, specially because this protein domain contains the four major antigenic sites of gS [9] [10] [11] 21] . The selected transgenic plants showed expression levels similar to that described with equivalent constructs in arabidopsis plants [13] , and those found expressing hepatitis B surface antigen, rabies virus glycoprotein or VP1 from foot and mouth disease virus [6, 16, 18] . The demonstration that many proteins from pathogens, including some expressed in transgenic plants [14, 17, 24] , are immunogenic when administered orally, encourage the study of other antigens expressed in plants with the goal of developing edible vaccines. Glycoprotein S from TGEV is an interesting model since this protein is resistant, at least when incorporated into the viral particle, to the gut degradation. In addition, the protective immune responses against TGEV have to be stimulated at the mucosal surfaces in order to elicit secretory and lactogenic immunity [9, 10, 20, 23 ]. In the above described work, we have demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of glycoprotein S expressed in potato plants is immunogenic when mice were fed with the transgenic potato tubers. Antibody titers obtained in mice orally immunized were higher than those obtained after intraperitoneal immunization. It could be explained by the differences in the antigen doses used in each administration route. Unfortunately, we were unable to induce neutralizing antibodies with the potato-derived gS independently of the immunization route used. Interestingly, in a similar experiment performed previously, all mice intramuscularly immunized with arabidopsis-derived gS presented a significant neutralization activity in their sera [13] . The differences in neutralization activity between sera from mice immunized with the arabidopsis-derived gS and potato-derived gS could be influenced by the postranslational processing of the glycoprotein depending of the plant used, or due to the plant proteins that, accompanying the recombinant gS, differentially modify in each plant species its spatial structure.",

This observation is very important in case of evaluating, in the future, the feasibility of vaccinating farm animals through the diet.

The DNA sequence encoding for the N-terminal domain of glycoprotein S from TGEV was cloned downstream of the CaMV 35S promoter in recombinant pRoK2 plasmid, followed by the nopaline synthase (NOS) terminator. This plasmid contains the left (LB) and right (RB) borders of transferred DNA that demarcates the sequences that are incorporated into the plant genome. B Presence of the recombinant sequence in representative transgenic potato plants detected by PCR. Plants 1 to 4 transformed with pRoK I, C-with pRoK2. C represents the control amplification of the same DNA fragment from pRoK I. C Detection of N-terminal domain of glycoprotein S polypeptide in protein extracts from transgenic plants by ELISA. Absorbance readings were obtained from arabidopsis leaves extracts transformed with pRoK I (1 to 4). Positive control is purified virus (TGEV) and negative control is a plant transformed with pRoK2 plasmid (C\u2212). Bars represent the meaning of three independent experiments with standard deviations",
