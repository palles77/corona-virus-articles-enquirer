            "text": "Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a major cause of lower respiratory infection in young children. Repeated infections occur throughout life, but its immune evasion mechanisms are largely unknown. We recently found that hMPV M2-2 protein elicits immune evasion by targeting mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), an antiviral signaling molecule. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying such inhibition are not known. Our mutagenesis studies revealed that PDZ-binding motifs, 29-DEMI-32 and 39-KEALSDGI-46, located in an immune inhibitory region of M2-2, are responsible for M2-2-mediated immune evasion. We also found both motifs prevent TRAF5 and TRAF6, the MAVS downstream adaptors, to be recruited to MAVS, while the motif 39-KEALSDGI-46 also blocks TRAF3 migrating to MAVS. In parallel, these TRAFs are important in activating transcription factors NF-kB and/or IRF-3 by hMPV. Our findings collectively demonstrate that M2-2 uses its PDZ motifs to launch the hMPV immune evasion through blocking the interaction of MAVS and its downstream TRAFs.",

            "text": "In response to virus infection, including infection by hMPV, host cells use several classes of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)like receptors, to launch the innate immune responses in a cell typedependent manner (reviewed in Kawai and Akira, 2006) ). hMPV infection of alveolar epithelial cells, the primary target of respiratory viruses, activates antiviral signaling via RIG-I and, subsequently, its adaptor MAVS, a mitochondrial protein, and further downstream kinases TRAFs/IKKs, to promote NF-\u03baB and IRF activation (Liao et al., 2008; Seth et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2006) . Recently, we have shown that the M2-2 protein contributes to the immune evasion by targeting MAVS (Ren et al., 2012) . However, the molecular mechanism by which M2-2 uses to disrupt MAVS-mediated signaling has not been investigated. M2-2 is highly conserved ( > 90%) between the two hMPV strains, A and B (Biacchesi et al., 2003) . The M2-2 of Canadian isolate hMPV83, which belongs to A2 strain and the focus of this study, has about 70 amino acids. The domains of M2-2 responsible for the immune inhibition locate in last 45 amino acids, which also promote viral genome replication and contain a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitope (Ren et al., 2012; Melendi et al., 2007; Herd et al., 2006 Herd et al., , 2008 . The first 25 amino acids of M2-2 are solely responsible for promoting viral gene transcription (Ren et al., 2012) . These multiple functions of M2-2 highlight the need to identify the domains/motifs responsible for different M2-2 functions. In this study, we first focused on identifying M2-2 motif(s) responsible for its immune inhibition, then addressed how these motifs affect MAVS-mediated anti-hMPV signaling. This study is potentially translational as it can provide the molecular basis for the design of new, safer and more effective hMPV vaccines and therapeutic molecules. Options that can be explored include designing M2-2 mutants with reduced inhibition of innate signaling, a full CTL epitope, and proper attenuation of viral RNA synthesis. Reagents that modify M2-2-host interaction and enhance the immune capability against hMPV infection might also be explored.",

Construction of M2-2 mutant cDNA was done similarly as previously illustrated (Ren et al., 2012; Bao et al., 2013) . In brief, the whole hMPV antigenome was engineered by ligating three separately cloned segments in a sequential order. Herein, we used site-directed mutagenesis to individually mutate two PDZ motifs of M2-2 in the second segment, followed by the replacement of WT segment with the mutated one. The multiple-site mutagenesis does not affect M2-1 codons. Primer sequence for generating M2-2 mutant antigenome is available upon request, and the recovery of recombinant hMPV was done as previously described (Ren et al., 2012; Bao et al., 2013) . Recombinant M2-2 mutant viruses were confirmed by sequencing of RT-PCR products of viral RNA. The recovered viruses were then amplified for two passages in LLC-MK2 cells and saved as stock viral preparations. Viruses with no more than 4-5 passages were used in all experiments.",

To quantify differences in the G transcription among different rhMPV infection, WT vs M2-2 mutants, a relative quantitative method was used as we previously described (Ren et al., 2012) . The RT primer to measure the transcription of the hMPV G: 5\u2032-CGTCTCAGCCAATCCCTGGTTTTTTTTTTTTCTAGTTTTGC-3\u2032. Primers were designed to incorporate a \"tag\" (underlined letters) as part of the assay due to self-priming exhibited by viral RNA (Bannister et al., 2010) . The tag sequence was derived from the bacterial chloramphenicol resistance (Cm r ) gene. The sequence with bold letters is complementary to poly(A) tails of the transcribed hMPV G gene. The sequence in italic is G gene specific. At a 25\u00b0C annealing temperature, the 10 nucleotides (nt) matching G-specific sequences would not be sufficient for a stable efficient priming of cDNA from an antigenome of hMPV (positive strand). On the other hand, 22 nucleotides matching transcribed N (12T's and G-gene-specific nucleotides) are able to attain stable annealing to the transcribed G gene. The hMPV G forward primer was 5\u2032-CATCAGTCCAGTCCGACAGC-3\u2032, and the reverse primer against hMPV tag was 5\u2032-CGTCTCAGCCAATCCCTGG-3\u2032.

The PDZ-binding motifs in the last 45 amino acids are 29-DEMI-32, 39-KEALSDGI-46, 58-LENI-61 and 61-IEII-64. Among them, the last two motifs contain an H-2 D -restricted CTL epitope, which is important for T cells to recognize and kill virusinfected cells and contribute to immunologic control of viral replication (Melendi et al., 2007) . Therefore, we first mutated motifs 29-DEMI-32 and 39-KEALSDGI-46 to initiate the immune regulatory motif identification. To do that, we generated two recombinant hMPV (rhMPV)containing mutation in E30 and M31 of motif 29-DEMI-32 (rhMPV-E30M31) or in E40, L42 and D44 of motif 39-KEALSDGI-46 (rhMPV-E40L42D44). We found that both rhMPV-E30M31 and rhMPV-E40L42D44 induced greater secretion of several cytokines/chemokines than wild type (WT)-rhMPV at 15 and/or 24 h p.i. (Fig. 1A) .",

Given facts that hMPV uses RIG-MAVS to launch antiviral immunity and RIG-I-MAVS pathway is known to be activated by viral RNAs, our result showing that rhMPV-E30M31 with suppressed genome replication enhanced induction of cytokines and chemokines similar to rhMPV-E40L42D44 suggested motif 29-DEMI-32 inhibits host immunity more significantly than motif 39-KEALSDGI-46 (Fig. 1A) . This also raised the possibility for rhMPV-E30M31 to be a potential live attenuated vaccine candidate as it not only enhanced immune responses but also suppressed the viral genome replication. Indeed, there was about more than a log decrease in infectious particle production when rhMPV-E30M31 was seeded into MK-2 cells at MOI of 0.01, compared to rhMPV-WT. A multi-cycle growth of WT and rhMPV-E30M31 was investigated by immune staining using anti-hMPV antibody. Attenuated replication of rhMPV-E30M31 was also observed in Vero cells, a cell line deficient of type I IFN genes, following multi-cycle growth (data not shown).",

Our results showed that treatment of A549 cells with siRNA targeting TRAFs effectively blocked the protein expression ( > 80%) ( Fig. 2A) . We also found that individual TRAF suppression by siRNA did not affect the expression of the rest of the investigated TRAFs (data not shown), suggesting that the expression of TRAFs is independent of each other. In response to hMPV, TRAF2 seemed not important in mediating the activation of p65 and IRF-3, two transcription factors critical for the induction of inflammatory/immune gene expression by hMPV (Bao et al., 2007) (Fig. 2A, upper left panel) . Consequently, TRAF2 did not affect hMPV-induced cytokines/chemokines (Fig. 2B) , suggesting that TRAF2 is not that critical for host anti-hMPV signaling in response to hMPV infection. In contrast with TRAF2, TRAF6 had a broad and significant effect on hMPV-induced antiviral signaling, as TRAF6 suppression by its specific siRNA led to decreased activation of p65 and IRF-3 ( Fig. 2A , lower right panel) and subsequently reduced secretion of proinflammatory and antiviral molecules (Fig. 2B) . We also found that TRAF3 and TRAF5 contributed to the activation of IRF-3 and p65, respectively ( Fig. 2A , upper right panel for TRAF3 and lower left panel for TRAF5) confirming that the role of TRAFs in virusmediated immune/inflammatory gene expression is isoform-specific.",

            "text": "As mentioned, hMPV M2-2 protein interacts with MAVS and subsequently blocks MAVS-mediated immune signaling (Ren et al., 2012) . However, M2-2 does not block the signaling induced by MAVS's downstream signaling molecules, including TRAF6 and IKKs (Ren et al., 2012) . In this study, we also found that M2-2 did not block TRAF-5-induced signaling, confirming MAVS, but not its downstream signaling factors, as the target of M2-2 (Fig. 3A) . One of the possible consequences of M2-2-mediated targeting of MAVS is that M2-2 disrupts MAVS-mediated signaling via blocking the interaction between MAVS and its downstream signaling molecules TRAF(s). To test whether the M2-2 protein blocks MAVS-TRAF interaction in airway epithelial cells, we investigated the TARF recruitment to mitochondria in response to rhMPV-WT and M2-2 mutants infection. Three TRAFs, i.e. TRAF 3, 5, and 6, were investigated, as they played a role in the activation of transcription factors NF-kB and/or IRF-3 and secretion of cytokines/chemokines in response to hMPV infection (Fig. 2) . Uninfected and infected A549 cells were harvested at 15 h p.i. to prepare the mitochondrial fraction. The mitochondrion purity was well controlled, as demonstrated by the expression of specific marker for cellular fractions during the preparation (Supplementary Fig1). We found that rhMPV-E40L42D44-infected cells, but not rhMPV-E30M31-infected cells, had a slightly higher TRAF3 recruitment to mitochondria than WT-infected cells (Fig. 3B) . We also found that there was a significant increase in the abundance of TRAF5 in both rhMPV-E40L42D44-and rhMPV-E30M31-infected cells compared to WT-infected cells. Compared to rhMPV-E30M31-infected cells, the increase of TRAF5 in rhMPV-E40L42D44-infected was much less. In terms of TRAF6 recruitment, both M2-2 mutants were able to recruit more TRAF6, with more recruitment in rhMPV-E30M31 -infected cells than in rhMPV-E40L42D44-infected cells (Fig. 3B) . To exclude the possibility that mutant-enhanced TRAF recruitment resulted from more MAVS in mitochondria, we investigated the abundance of MAVS and the mitochondrial protein SDHA (succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit A, used as loading control). Slightly decreased MAVS in the mitochondria and stable levels of SDHA on exposure to mutant viruses suggested this is not the case. In parallel to the slight decreased MAVS expression, mitochondrial M2-2 expression was also slightly declined in mutant-infected cells, suggesting that the binding of M2-2 protein to MAVS is proportionally even between WT-and mutantinfected cells. All of these results supported that the PDZ motifs of M2-2 inhibit MAVS-TRAF/3/5/6 interaction in infected cells.",

The effectiveness of innate immune response against viral infection depends on the interactive nature of virus components with the host innate antiviral immune systems, including the MAVS centered signalosome . TRAFs, as important signaling adaptors of MAVS, are critical for antiviral function in a cell-type and pathogen-specific manner (Saha et al., 2006; Fig. 1 .

A549 cells in 6-well plates were mock infected or infected with rhMPV at MOI of 2 for various periods of time as indicated, followed by total RNA extraction using Trizol. The extracted RNAs in triplicate were then subjected to real-time PCR to assay genomic RNAs (left panel) or viral G gene transcription (right panel).

At 48 h post transfection, cells were mock infected or infected with hMPV for 15 h at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2. (A). Cell were harvested to prepare total cell lysates or nuclear fractions. Total cell lysates were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis of TRAFs expression.

Among the six TRAF members, except TRAF-1, other members have an N-terminal RING finger domain, followed by a variable number of zinc fingers (Wajant et al., 2001) . As shown in Fig. 2 , TRAF-activated NF-kB and IRF-3 in response to hMPV is also isotypespecific. TRAF2 seems not critical in the antiviral signaling at all. TRAF3 and TRAF5 contribute to the activation of IRF-3 and NF-kB, respectively, while TRAF-6 controls the activation of both transcription factors. There are still many questions that need to be addressed for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of antiviral signaling by TRAFs. Do TRAFs use their structural motif(s), such as RING and zinc fingers, to control the activation the NF-kB and/or IRF-3? If so, which ones are responsible? This information is important as it should provide insights into developing reagents to modify the interaction of TRAFs with their up-and down-stream signaling molecules to control inflammation and enhance antiviral immunity during hMPV infection.",

            "text": "Viruses inhibit MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling via several mechanisms. Hepatitis C virus uses its NS3-4A to cleave MAVS to block MAVS-dependent antiviral signaling (Welsch et al., 2015) . Rotavirus NS1 protein inhibits MAVS expression to attenuate its signaling (Nandi et al., 2014) . Coronavirus targets MAVS/TRAF3/TRAF6 signalosome to suppress MAVS-mediated signaling (Shi et al., 2014) . These studies also demonstrate that the molecular mechanisms used by viruses to block MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling are virus-specific. Here we demonstrated that hMPV M2-2 protein uses its PDZ motifs 29-DEMI-32 and 39-KEALSDGI-46 to suppress MAVS signaling by preventing the migration of adaptors TRAF3/5/6 to the mitochondrial MAVS. As mentioned, the interaction between the TRAF domain of TRAFs and the TIM of MAVS is required for MAVS-mediated signaling (Saha et al., 2006; Kumar et al., 2006) . However, M2-2 does not contain a TRAF/ TIM domain, but is enriched with PDZ domains. Ranganathan and Ross (1997) Among four PDZ-binding motifs in innate immune inhibitory domains of M2-2, motifs 29-DEMI-32 and 39-KEALSDGI-46 were investigated since the other two PDZ motifs, 58-LENI-61 and 61-IEII-64, have H-2 d -restricted CTL epitopes (Melendi et al., 2007) . We found that both motif 29-DEMI-32 and motif 39-KEALSDGI-46 are important for the activation of NF-kB-and IRF-3, and, subsequently, the induction of antiviral and proinflammatory mediators. The molecular mechanisms associated with 29-DEMI-32 -inhibited MAVS signaling is likely via preventing the recruitment of TRAF5 and TRAF6, two significant molecules controlling NF-kB and/or IRF-3 activation in hMPV infection. In addition, motif 39-KEALSDGI-46 also hampered the migration of TRAF3 to the mitochondria. Our findings are consistent with what we have previously reported-the domains where the motifs belong are not critical to viral gene transcription because mutations in these two motifs did not affect the gene transcription of viral proteins. However, the motif 29-DEMI-32 seemed also important for viral genome replication consistent with the fact that rhMPV-E30M31 was much more attenuated than rhMPV-E40L42D44. Collectively, results from both overexpression and recombinant virus systems complimentarily revealed novel motifs of M2-2 as innate immunity regulators and provided additional insights into the attenuation mechanism of rhMPV with complete M2-2 deletion (\u0394M2-2). Currently, we are investigating whether rhMPV-E30M31 and rhMPV-E40L42D44 can be used to as more effective live attenuated vaccines against hMPV by comparing their immunogenicity, attenuation, and Th1/Th2 balance with those of \u0394M2-2 (manuscript in preparation). This study reveals novel motifs of hMPV M2-2 protein responsible for regulating host antiviral response, a critical starting point for the accomplishment of preventive and therapeutic objectives. . The effect of M2-2 on TRAF-activated signaling. A549 cells were transfected a luciferase reporter plasmid NF-\u03baB-Luc (0.5 \u00b5g/well), a plasmid encoding TRAF5 or its control (0.5 \u00b5g/well), and a plasmid encoding hMPV M2-2 or its mutants, or a control vector (0.1 \u00b5g/well). After 30 h, cells were harvested for luciferase activity measurement. (B). The effect of motifs on the recruitment of TRAFs to mitochondrial compartment. A549 cells were infected with rhMPV-WT, rhMPV-E30M31, or rhMPV-E40L42D44, at MOI of 2, for 15 h and harvested to purify mitochondria. The abundance of mitochondria-associated MAVS, M2-2 and TRAF proteins was investigated by Western blot. Membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-SDHA, as control for comparable loading of samples. Data shown are representative of two independent experiments.",
