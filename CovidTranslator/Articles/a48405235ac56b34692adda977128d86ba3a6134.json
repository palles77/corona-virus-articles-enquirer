            "text": "In this study, swine fecal specimens (n = 251) collected from nursing and weaned piglets raised under smallholder production systems were screened for the presence of kobuviruses by RT-PCR. Porcine kobuviruses were detected in 13.1 % (33/251) of the samples. We demonstrated that porcine kobuvirus infections exist in indigenous pigs in Kenya and Uganda and that the prevalence was higher in young piglets than older pigs: nursing piglets (15 %), post-weaning (3month-old) pigs (17 %), 4-month-old pigs (10 %). Genetic analysis of the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region (690 nt) revealed that kobuviruses circulating in East Africa are diverse, sharing nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 89.7 to 99.1 % and 88 to 92.3 % among them and with known porcine kobuviruses, respectively. The nucleotide sequence identities between our kobuvirus strains and those of human, bovine and canine kobuviruses were 69.4-70.7 %, 73.1-74.4 % and 67-70.7 %, respectively. Additionally, upon sequencing selected samples that showed consistent 720-bp RT-PCR bands while using the same primer set, we detected porcine astroviruses in our samples belonging to type 2 and type 3 mamastroviruses. To our knowledge, this study reports the first detection and molecular analysis of both porcine kobuviruses and astroviruses in an African region. Further studies are required to determine the role of these viruses in gastrointestinal infections of pigs in this region and to determine the genetic diversity of the circulating strains to develop accurate diagnostic tools and implement appropriate control strategies.",

            "text": "Small-scale pig production (free range or small backyard herds) constitutes >70 % of the total pig farms in East Africa. Pigs in this region often live in close proximity to humans, causing public health concerns and a need for increasing health standards. East Africa is also known for the large population of wild (bush) pigs and warthogs that are in close contact with domestic pigs, creating favorable conditions for intermixing and spread of viral strains. Emerging viruses represent a threat to human and food animal health, as evidenced by sporadic outbreaks of influenza and coronavirus infection. Hence, knowledge about the diversity of viruses present in reservoir animals can lead to a better understanding of the origin of emerging pathogens. Kobuviruses, which are members of the genus Kobuvirus, family Picornaviridae, are small, non-enveloped viruses with single-stranded, positive-sense genomic RNA. The genus Kobuvirus includes three officially recognized species: Aichivirus A, Aichivirus B (bovine kobuvirus), and Aichivirus C (porcine kobuvirus) [1] . The kobuvirus genome is approximately 8.3 kb long and is organized into three structural (VP0, VP3 and VP1) and seven non-structural (2A-2C and 3A-3D) regions with a leader protein (L). The 3D gene region encodes a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and represents a region that is conserved among kobuviruses [2] . Nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities of the 3D RdRp coding region among porcine kobuvirus, bovine kobuvirus and Aichi virus vary from 74.0 % to 81.0 % [3] . Aichi virus was first detected in Japan in 1989 from a human patient with acute gastroenteritis [4] . Since then, Aichi virus has been detected in Asia, Europe, South America and Tunisia [5] [6] [7] [8] . Bovine kobuvirus was first recognized in 2003 as a cytopathic contaminant in cell culture medium derived from bovine serum in Japan. Later, it was found in fecal samples of clinically healthy cattle [9] . Bovine kobuvirus has also been detected in domestic sheep in Hungary [10, 11] . Porcine kobuvirus (S-1-HUN/2007: EU787450) was first identified from fecal samples of domestic pigs in 2008 in Hungary [1] . Thereafter, porcine kobuvirus was reported in additional countries, including Asian countries [12, 13] , the Netherlands and Brazil [14] , and the USA [15] . The prevalence of kobuvirus infection in pigs ranges from 30 % to 99 %. This large variation could be a result of different ages within the populations evaluated, diarrheal status, regional differences, and other factors. Studies showing association of porcine kobuvirus infection with clinical disease are limited; however, a recent study in Korea found an association between porcine kobuvirus detection and diarrhea in pigs [13] . An association between kobuvirus infection and age has been reported in cattle and in pigs [16] .",

Astroviruses are generally associated with either mild or severe enteric disease symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting in a number of mammalian species [17] . Bridger in the UK and Saif et al. [18, 19] in the USA reported the first porcine astroviruses (PAstV) detected in pigs by electron microscopy. Later in 1990, PAstV was isolated in Japan [20] . Recently, Mor and co-workers also reported PAstV in pigs in the USA with a prevalence of 62 % [21] . To date, five PAstV types (PAstV1-PAstV5) have been identified from different countries, including the Czech Republic, Colombia, Canada, the USA, China and Hungary [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Among the five types, PAstV1, PAstV2 and PAstV3 were identified in fecal samples from healthy pigs.",

The sample collection consisted of 41 samples from nursing pigs (less than 4 weeks of age), 90 samples from post-weaning pigs (12 weeks of age) and 120 samples from growers (16 weeks of age). All pigs appeared clinically healthy at the time of sampling. Fresh samples were collected from individual pigs, placed into a sterile specimen container and stored on dry ice before being transported to the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) laboratory in Busia, where the samples were stored at \u221270 \u00b0C until use.

This same primer pair was used for the detection of porcine kobuviruses from East African pigs. RT-PCR was carried out using Accupower \u00ae PCR premix (Bioneer Co, S. Korea) according to manufacturer's instructions. Accupower \u00ae PCR premix is a ready-to-use lyophilized premix of dNTPs, Taq DNA Polymerase, reaction buffer, a tracking dye, and a stabilizer. Briefly, in each 20-\u03bcl reaction premix tube, 2 \u03bcl (5-50 ng) of cDNA template was mixed with 1 \u03bcl (10 pMol) each of forward and reverse primers, and 16 \u03bcl of nuclease-free water. PCR was performed at 94 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 48 \u00b0C of 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 30 s, followed by a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. The temperature was then held at 4 \u00b0C. The RT-PCR products were analyzed by 1.5 % agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ultraviolet illumination after staining with Gel Red\u2122 nucleic acid gel stain (Biotium, Hayward, CA). When bands were found in the region of 1,100 bp on the agarose gel, we tentatively considered the results kobuvirus positive. The samples with the correct band size were purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions for sequencing. In other fecal samples, an approximately 720-nt-long weak, nonspecific PCR product was also observed. The nucleotide (nt) sequence of the PCR products of three selected samples from three different farms were determined by direct sequencing.",

Among the age groups, younger piglets shed more virus than older pigs, and a higher incidence (15 of 90, 16.7 %) of kobuvirus was reported in post-weaning (3-month-old) piglets compared to nursing piglets (6 of 41, 14.6 %) and grower pigs (12 of 120, 10 %). This could possibly be due to an inefficient immune response, diminishing maternal immunity post-weaning, or other intrinsic age-related factors. Higher rates of infection in young piglets has also been reported in other studies [3, 13, 14] . Based on management systems in the study area, confinement of pigs presented a higher risk of kobuvirus infection, with housed pigs shedding more virus than free-ranging pigs (Table 1 ). This could be the result of viral accumulation in the pig houses or the places where pigs are tethered. Additionally, kobuvirus was more prevalent in the farms with larger herd size (>10 pigs, 20 %) than farms with small herds (<10 pigs, 12.6 %).",

A recent study in Korea detected porcine kobuvirus in 84.5 % of diarrheic pigs and 19.3 % of healthy pigs [13] . Similarly, a study in Japan using samples from healthy pigs reported 45.4 % prevalence of porcine kobuvirus [12] . This difference may be attributable to variations in the samples due to factors like sampling time, sampling place (distribution of sampling farms), sample size, age of pigs, and clinical background of the tested animal population (diarrhea or clinically healthy). The association of this agent with enteric diseases in pigs in the study area remains unclear, since we only analyzed samples from asymptomatic pigs, and no data were available from tests for kobuvirus in pigs with gastroenteritis from the same farms; however, some of the positive samples came from farms with a history of diarrhea. This study confirmed that infection with kobuvirus in asymptomatic pigs is common, as has been reported in other studies [14, 32, 34] . Further studies on risk factors for this infection and the association of this virus with gastroenteritis are necessary, especially in developing countries where a majority of pigs are raised in smallholder production systems with varied management.",

The other two strains (K-006-KF597280 and K-332-KF597281) had 96.7 % identity to porcine astrovirus type 3. This was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis, in which K-006-KF597280 and K-332-KF597281 strains clustered with astrovirus type 3 (PAstV-3-US-MO123-JX556691) detected in the USA, while the K-268-KF597282 strain clustered with astrovirus type 2 (PAstV-2/2007/HUN-GU562296) detected in Hungary (Fig. 2) . Recent studies in the USA revealed high genetic heterogeneity of PAstV strains [35] . The importance of co-circulation of PAstVs and the role pigs may play in the transmission and recombination of this virus need further investigation.",

The presence of these gastroenteritisproducing viruses in clinically healthy pigs represents a source of infection of pigs, and possibly to humans, and hence, further studies are required to determine their role in gastrointestinal infections of pigs in this region and to determine their genetic diversity in order to develop accurate diagnostic tools and implement appropriate control strategies.
