            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus which first appeared in southern China at the end of 2002. In early 2003, through a single incident, it spread to Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada and Vietnam. For busy clinicians in large public hospitals, the response to the virus was initially based on ensuring a high level of protection for staff. However, as the epidemic progressed and more information became available about the virus, procedures were rationalized and the virus is currently under control worldwide. There are, however, numerous unanswered questions concerning super-spreading events, the modes of transmission of the virus and, perhaps most importantly, the rapid detection of the virus early in the course of disease. These issues need to be addressed in case the virus becomes more widespread in the near future.",

            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly recognized coronavirus infection that emerged in southern China [1] with subsequent global spread to 29 countries [2] [3] [4] [5] . In countries where local transmission has occurred, hospitals have been the major foci of infection especially in Singapore [6] and Canada [7] . In February 2003, reports began emerging on ProMed Mail of an outbreak of atypical pneumonia in the Guangdong province in southern China [8] . It is now believed that the first cases of SARS occurred in the city of Foshan in the Guangdong province [1] . However, throughout November until the late part of February, SARS was largely confined to the province of Guangdong. The global dissemination of SARS is believed to have begun on the ninth floor of Hotel M in Hong Kong, where a physician from Guangdong stayed for one night on 22 February 2003 [9] . At least 16 individuals who were staying on the ninth floor of the hotel were subsequently infected with SARS, although none of them reportedly had direct contact with the ill physician. The newly infected individuals traveled onward to their homes or next destinations in the USA, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and Ireland sparking off epidemics of varying degrees of severity in each of those countries, mainly in hospitals but also in their respective communities. It is striking to realize that the entire global dissemination of this epidemic can probably be traced to this single event of one overnight hotel stay.",

Within weeks of the first cases, electronic publications reviewed the clinical syndromes [4, 5] as well as the characteristics of the virus and methods for its detection by the polymerase chain reaction [2, 3] . The genome of various strains of the virus were sequenced, which contributed tremendously to knowledge of its molecular epidemiology [10] . There was an explosion of reports about the SARS coronavirus, with more than a thousand publications available on PubMed by the beginning of March 2004, the first anniversary of the global emergence of the virus. It is beyond the scope of this review to cover all of the virological and clinical information contained in these articles and I would refer the reader to the excellent review by Peiris et al. [11] . The present review focuses on the response to this emerging disease and its evolution in light of increasing information. Outstanding issues that remain to be resolved are also highlighted.",

The same was noted in Vietnam and led to the World Health Organization (WHO) sending a team to Vietnam under the leadership of Dr Carlo Urbani, who later died from the virus he helped to define [12] . As soon as SARS was recognized as a nosocomial infection, guidelines were issued by various authorities including the WHO It is important to recognize that in the beginning of the SARS outbreak there was no information about the agent responsible for the infection or its mode of transmission; hence, there was a tendency to \"over-protect.\" As the epidemic evolved, so did the guidelines, which are constantly being updated and might indeed be out of date by the time this report is read. All guidelines are published on the internet [13-18], and the reader is encouraged to review the websites for the latest information.",

It is striking that although he was critically ill and intubated on a ventilator in the intensive care unit, only one HCW who attended to him in the emergency department became ill [19] . The reason for this is likely that Hong Kong hospitals had been on the alert for highly pathogenic avian influenza. In February, there had been a small cluster of cases of avian influenza in a Hong Kong family that had traveled to mainland China [20] . A directive had gone out from the Hong Kong Department of Health on 21 February 2003 to maintain strict infection control with droplet precautions for all cases of \"atypical\" community-acquired pneumonia because of concerns that highly pathogenic avian influenza might be easily transmissible from person to person.",

The use of PPE is also not without its own adverse consequences [31] as reactions to latex are common among HCWs, some with serious consequences. It should also be noted that the use of respirators has been associated with fatal adverse events [32] . Costs are also an issue, and in resource-poor settings 12-ply cotton masks have been used, which have reportedly been effective in preventing the nosocomial transmission of the virus in at least one large public hospital [33] . In a case-control study, Seto et al. [34] found that surgical masks were also effective in preventing transmission of SARS to HCWs, which is in line with our understanding of the epidemiology of the virus. In Singapore, one of the successes of our approach to the control of SARS was the widespread availability of full PPE for any staff member who requested it. This was even before the widespread dissemination of the virus led to the mandatory use of full PPE in all hospitals, and it provided staff the reassurance that their welfare was a high priority in the midst of an epidemic.",

The Singapore experience [41] was that three flights with symptomatic SARS patients resulted in only one transmission. The overall attack rate for the flights into Singapore was thus less than 1% despite one symptomatic individual being a so-called \"superspreader\" and another being critically ill at the time of the flight, requiring intubation soon after arrival. Interestingly, Olson et al. [40] point out that fully 45% of the fellow passengers who became infected with SARS had no direct contact, as defined by the WHO, with the index patient on their ill-fated flight. They do not offer any explanation for the differing attack rates, although a careful reader would realize that among the 22 individuals allegedly infected on the flight, ten were traveling together as part of a tour group. Also, the flight with the four symptomatic individuals was much shorter than the flight that was associated with widespread transmission. This is supported by ICU data from Canada [42] that showed time of exposure to be a major risk factor. Overall, however, what these reports demonstrate is that a much more detailed analysis is required in order to truly understand the epidemiology of this unusual virus.",

Therefore, N95 respirators or higher should be used. This is a cause for concern as in many countries, including Singapore, without adequate pre-prepared negative-pressure rooms, powerful extractor fans similar to the ones used in the bathrooms at the Amoy Gardens apartments are used to create a form of laminar uni-directional airflow.

While it is tempting to ascribe this to infection control measures, many of these individuals were infected and hospitalized long before the institution of infection control methods. This has given rise to the concept of \"super-spreaders.\" It is known that the presence of common viral upper respiratory tract infections can turn some HCWs into so-called \"cloud HCWs\" [51] . These individuals have been linked with the airborne dispersal of agents that are normally only spread through contact, such as group A streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus. The hypothesis is that the presence of upper respiratory tract infections transforms these individuals into efficient transmitters of pathogens through increased coughing, sneezing or nose rubbing.",

The index patient for the Singapore epidemic was not isolated, and 22 HCWs, visitors and fellow patients were infected [6] . The second generation of cases associated with this cluster, before the institution of infection control practices or strict isolation, included only 13 cases. The situation in Canada was similar, with cases in the second generation occurring preisolation [7] . It is quite clear, however, that non-isolated patients are hazardous to staff, visitors and other patients. Single non-isolated patients have led to well-documented outbreaks in hospitals in Singapore [49] , Taiwan [52], Canada [53] and Hong Kong [54] . The phenomenon of \"super-spreaders\" has been invoked to explain why so few transmissions resulted from the majority of non-isolated individuals while a few rare cases were associated with the vast majority of transmissions [49] . The jury is still out as to whether these are indeed individuals who are for some reason more able to transmit infection or whether events, such as the use of high-flow oxygen therapy, are more responsible for what are probably more accurately described as \"super-spreading events.\" Until we have more virologic information, we have to assume that all individuals with SARS are \"super-spreaders\" until proven otherwise and we have to take all the necessary precautions.",

            "text": "Again, because of the concern that an undiagnosed patient might turn out to be a \"super-spreader,\" the threshold to isolation has become progressively lower. Initially, hospitals and clinics were using the WHO case definitions of suspect and probable SARS cases to determine which cases to isolate. As we, and others, have pointed out, atypical presentations [55] are the Achilles heel of such a strategy and these have been associated with significant nosocomial transmission. In a very important report from a SARS screening clinic, Rainer et al. [56] pointed out that the WHO criteria, which were actually designed for epidemiologic purposes, while relatively specific, have a sensitivity of only about 25% in predicting which individuals will turn out to have SARS. The implications are that a large number of individuals will need to be isolated and monitored very closely until their clinical course becomes evident. In practice in Singapore, this resulted in the conversion of large numbers of hospital wards to isolation facilities, cancellation of elective surgeries and an overall paralysis of the healthcare system. We used a regime of 4-hourly temperature monitoring without any use at all of antipyretics together with daily serial chest radiographs and blood counts and comprehensive chemistry work ups. With this regime, we found a sensitivity of 28%, specificity of 96%, positive predictive value of 11% and negative predictive value of 99% for the WHO criteria at patient presentation [57] . It is clear that an accurate rapid diagnostic test is urgently needed to allow us to filter out individuals who are at low risk of SARS or, better still, at lower risk of transmitting the virus should they not be isolated. Current diagnostic tests [58] , which are based on either molecular methods or serological diagnosis, are severely limited not predominantly by sensitivity or specificity but by the fact that they take awhile to become positive, during which time widespread dissemination of the virus could have occurred from a single non-isolated \"super-spreader.\"",

Two other patients, one visitor and one nurse who had been in the same emergency department area as this patient were infected with SARS. The visitor, a previously healthy 28-year-old woman, died and her husband and son were subsequently infected. In the brief period the index patient was in the general ward, two other patients and the entire shift of nurses working in the ward at the time, who were only wearing N95 masks, were infected. By the time the patient became febrile in the intensive care unit, staff were wearing full PPE and no further infections resulted. Thus, a single patient who \"passed\" two strict fever screens managed to be the source of at least nine infections in less than 24 h. This patient was critically ill and died 3 days later; thus, he may have had a very high viral load. This case illustrates the limitations of \"cookbook screening\" by using fever protocols without paying attention to a careful clinical history and physical examination. In this case, an alert cardiology team who re-did the patient's history and examination and performed a bedside echocardiograph to prove that he was suffering from pneumonia not heart failure made the diagnosis.",

In Singapore, on 22 March, the decision was made to close one hospital to new admissions and to concentrate all SARS patients there [6] . This unfortunately led to patients recently discharged from this hospital being shunted to other hospitals and starting off epidemics there. Now, in Singapore, once a cluster of cases with even a low degree of suspicion is identified, the unit is \"locked down\" with no admissions, transfers or discharges in order to prevent a recurrence of the former situation.

I have a personal \"wish list\" of questions that I would like answered before too long. These include: what are the conditions required for the airborne transmission of the SARS coronavirus? When can we be sure that transmission does not occur? When can we get a good rapid diagnostic test that is positive early in the course of the illness? What makes a super-spreading event? Is quarantine really necessary? I can only hope that the answers to these and numerous other questions raised by infection control practitioners, hospital epidemiologists, infectious disease clinicians and researchers can be answered before we face the next SARS outbreak or something worse! Even as this is being written, avian influenza rampages across East Asia affecting primarily birds, but also claiming the lives of more than 20 individuals.
