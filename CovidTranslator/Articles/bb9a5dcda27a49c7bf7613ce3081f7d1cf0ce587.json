The goal of this study is to characterize the expression of the structural (S, E, M, N) and accessory (ORF 3, ORF 4a, ORF 4b, ORF 5) proteins of MERS-CoV and to determine whether any of these proteins acts as an interferon antagonist. Individual structural and accessory protein-coding plasmids with an N-terminal HA tag were constructed and transiently transfected into cells, and their native expression and subcellular localization were assessed using Wes tern blotting and indirect immunofl uorescence. While ORF 4b demonstrated majorly nuclear localization, all of the other proteins demonstrated cytoplasmic localization. In addition, for the fi rst time, our experiments revealed that the M, ORF 4a, ORF 4b, and ORF 5 proteins are potent interferon antagonists. Further examination revealed that the ORF 4a protein of MERS-CoV has the most potential to counteract the antiviral effects of IFN via the inhibition of both the interferon production (IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity, IRF-3/7 and NF-\u03baB activation) and ISRE promoter element signaling pathways. Together, our results provide new insights into the function and pathogenic role of the structural and accessory proteins of MERS-CoV.",

Several struc- The genome structure of coronaviruses is highly conserved among all known coronaviruses. Each coronavirus has similar structural ORFs in their genomes. The accessory ORFs are unique to each coronavirus. There is no sequence or structural similarities between the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV accessory proteins.

Samples were collected from cells transiently transfected with individual ORF expression plasmids or pCAGGS (indicated as Mock) at 3 days posttransfection, and 100 ng of protein was loaded into each lane for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using mouse anti-HA and anti-\u03b2-actin mAbs as the primary antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution.

These accessory proteins may infl uence viral pathogenesis and disease outcomes, regulate specific virus-host interactions and/or promote the development of an intracellular environment that is conducive for effi cient virus growth, as reported for SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses (McBride et al., 2012) . However, the precise location and function of these proteins remain unclear and are of particular interest for understanding the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. The final broad category of coronavirus genes encodes the replicase proteins, also called nonstructural proteins. These viral proteins are encoded in the 5'-most two-thirds of the coronavirus genome, which is essential for polyprotein processing, replicase complex formation, and effi cient virus replication.",

The subversion of the host IFN system is a key component of pathogenic viral infection and is mediated by virus-encoded IFN antagonist proteins. Each protein blocks one or more key signaling proteins in the IFN and NF-\u03baB pathways to enhance viral replication and pathogenesis (Garc\u00eda-Sastre et al., 2006; Randall et al., 2008; Taylor et al., 2013) . A number of coronavirus gene products have been implicated in the disruption of signal transduction events required for the IFN response (Totura et al., 2012) .

Previous studies showed that coronavirus E proteins may have different subcellular localizations. For example, the SARS-E protein forms large membrane clusters codistributing with ER markers, while the IBV-E protein is localized to the Golgi complex (Corse et al., 2000; Nal et al., 2005; Nieto-Torres et al., 2011) . Our results demonstrated that the MERS-E protein mainly co-localizes with the Golgi apparatus, similar to IBV-E (Fig. 2B) .

Likewise, the MERS-CoV M protein clearly co-localized with the Golgi apparatus and ERGIC in the perinuclear area, and there were also distinct punctate within the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C ).

Preventing expression from the interferon promoter is one of the mechanisms by which viral proteins inhibit the interferon response, so IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation in response to Sendai virus (SeV) infection in the presence or absence of MERS proteins was measured. As expected, the positive control (NS1) demonstrated the strongest inhibition of IFN-\u03b2-luciferase, up to approximately 80% (Fig. 3A) . The MERS-CoV ORF 4a, ORF 4b, ORF 5, and M proteins all showed different levels of inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 promoter, of which ORF 4a was the strongest, as it exhibited a similar inhibition as the positive control (NS1).

IRF-3 is constitutively expressed in the cytoplasm in latent form and is regulated by posttranslational modifi cation. Phosphorylated IRF-3 undergoes dimerization, nuclear translocation, and association with the co-activator CBP/p300 and then primarily activates the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. Previous studies have shown that the binding of activated IRF-3 to the interferon promoter is necessary for interferon induction (Garc\u00eda-Sastre et al., 2006) . The ability of the four MERS-CoV proteins to block the IRF-3-mediated activation of its binding sites was evaluated using a plasmid containing a fi refl y luciferase gene under the control of a promoter with three IRF-3 binding sites (55-CIB). All four MERS-CoV proteins, i.e., ORF 4a, ORF 4b, ORF 5, and M, inhibited the activation of the 55-CIB promoter similarly to the positive control, NS1 (Fig. 4A) . These results indicate that ORF 4a, ORF 4b, ORF 5, and M prevent the activation of promoters requiring IRF-3 binding, such as the interferon promoter. Given the ability of the four proteins to inhibit the IRF-3-mediated activation of its binding sites, it was important to determine how the function of IRF-3 was blocked. As expected, IRF-3 remained in the cytoplasm of mock cells, while it translocated to the nuclei of SeV-infected cells (Fig. 4B ). Cells expressing MERS-CoV proteins demonstrated exclusively cytoplasmic GFP-IRF-3 localization following SeV infection, providing evidence that the expression of the four proteins blocks the virusinduced nuclear accumulation of IRF-3.",

In addition, these studies pinpoint key host cell components that function to regulate viral replication and pathogenesis, providing novel targets for the development of antiviral compounds (Garc\u00eda-Sastre et al., 2006; Randall et al., 2008; Taylor et al., 2013) . In this study, we have used several IFN antagonist assays to identify the M, ORF 4a, ORF 4b, and ORF 5 proteins of MERS-CoV as potential IFN antagonists. These novel fi ndings, coupled with the previous identification of differential IFN antagonist activities encoded within different regions of coronaviruses, suggest that Coronaviridae genomes likely encode multiple and different antagonists of the innate immune system. Understanding the mechanism of action of each antagonist may also direct us to novel therapeutic targets on both the virus and the host. Our results showed that, similar to other coronaviruses, individually expressed recombinant MERS-CoV S protein was detected throughout the typical secretory pathway of mammalian cells, from the ER to the plasma membrane. Consistent with SARS-S, MERS-S may also contain a dibasic motif that retains the protein in the ERGIC (Lu et al., 2011) . However, unlike the SARS-CoV S protein, the MERS-CoV S protein did not primarily concentrate in the Golgi region (Nal et al., 2005) . Previous studies on SARS-CoV showed that the M protein localizes predominantly to the Golgi apparatus and overlaps with the ERGIC (Nal et al., 2005) ; our results showed the same localization for the MERS-CoV M protein. Whereas SARS-CoV E is generally detected in the perinuclear regions and the ER (Nieto-Torres et al., 2011) , MERS-CoV E was predominantly detected in the Golgi apparatus in this study, similarly to the IBV-E protein (Corse e t al., 2000) . While the N protein of several CoVs localizes to the nucleolus during infection and after the transfection of cells with N genes, such as IBV, TGEV, and MHV Lontok et al., 2004) , the N protein of MERS-CoV was observed to exclusively localize to the cytoplasm, similar to the N protein of SARS-CoV Surjit et al., 2005; You et al., 2005) . MERS-N is predicted to contain two nuclear localization signals (pat 4: RHKR at 251 aa; pat7: PKKEKKQ at 362 aa) using PSORTII (http://psort.nibb. ac.jp). However, the protein does not seem to localize to the nucleus, so we may presume that the two nuclear localization signal (NLS) motifs are inactive or inaccessible or that cytoplasmic localization was the dominant localization signal in the protein. These data suggest that the nuclear localization of the N protein is not a common property among all coronaviruses.",

            "text": "The initial host response to infection is controlled by the innate immune system, which serves as a robust barrier to the establishment and maintenance of a productive viral infection. However, viruses have coevolved an armament of components that evade and/or block host innate immune responses, or they express components that shield infection from detection (Garc\u00eda-Sastre et al., 2006; Randall et al., 2008; Taylor et al., 2013) . Type I IFNs are essential for host protection against coronaviruses. The viruses may encode proteins (IFN antagonists) that directly inhibit the signaling pathways that are responsible for IFN induction. Signifi cant amounts of data support the hypothesis that coronaviruses encode one or more IFN antagonist genes. Among the human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV is the best characterized both biochemically and molecularly. Notably, the first coronavirus antagonists of innate immunity were documented in the SARS-CoV genome, pioneering similar studies in other important human and animal CoV genomes. Until recently, SARS-CoV has been shown to have at least 8 proteins that inhibit IFN induction/signaling, including nsp1 (Wathelet et al., 2007; Kamitani et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2011) , PLP (Devaraj et al., 2007; Frieman et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2012) , nsp7, nsp15 (Frieman et al., 2009), ORF 3b, ORF 6, N, and Siu et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2011) . Moreover, the SARS-CoV ORF 6 protein is known to inhibit IFN-induced JAK-STAT signaling by blocking the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated STAT1 (p-STAT1) Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007) . Recent studies have found that the MERS-CoV failed to elicit strong type I IFN or proinflammatory innate immune responses in ex vivo respiratory tissue cultures. The replication of MERS-CoV was strongly inhibited by treatment with cyclosporin A or IFN-\u03b1, and MERS-CoV infection could not inhibit the nuclear translocation of p-STAT1 (Chan et al., 2013; de Wilde et al., 2013) , indicating that MERS-CoV may have evolved some alternative mechanisms to combat IFNs.",

            "text": "Similar to SARS-CoV (Totura et al., 2012) , several MERS-CoV structural and accessory proteins act as IFN antagonists when transiently expressed in this study. The M protein and the products of the accessory genes ORF 4a, ORF 4b, and ORF 5 were all found to prevent the synthesis of IFN-\u03b2 through the inhibition of interferon promoter activation and IRF-3 function. The possible mechanism for the inhibition of IRF-3 nuclear translocation is the inhibition of the phosphorylation of IRF-3 (Garc\u00eda-Sastre et al., 2006) . In addition, the ORF 4a, ORF 4b, and M proteins inhibited ISRE activation. Furthermore, ORF 4a protein inhibited NF-\u03baB and was the most potent interferon antagonist among all above proteins tested. Because MERS-CoV infection could not inhibit the nuclear translocation of p-STAT1 (de Wilde et al., 2013) , the mechanism of the inhibition of interferon signaling for ORF 4a, ORF 4b, and M needs further elucidation. Similar to other highly pathogenic viruses, such as the Nipah virus (Shaw et al., 2009) , MHV (Ye et al., 2007; Koetzner et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2011) , SARS-CoV (Devaraj et al., 2007; Frieman et al., 2007; Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007; Frieman et al., 2009; Siu et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2012) , and Ebola viruses (Reid et al., 2006; Basler et al., 2007) , MERS-CoV encodes more than one protein that is able to inhibit interferon, which may contribute to the severe pathogenicity of the virus. Given the diverse array of novel genetic functions, it is not surprising that MERS-CoV also encodes several proteins that modulate the host innate immune response during infection via different pathways and acts on multiple targets within the innate immune response (Frieman et al., 2008; Totura et al., 2012) .",

Furthermore, our in vitro results fi rst identifi ed that the M, ORF 4a, ORF 4b, and ORF 5 proteins of MERS-CoV are potential interferon antagonists. ORF 4a was the most potent antagonist, inhibiting multiple levels of the IFN response via the inhibition of both interferon production (IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity, IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB activation) and the ISRE promoter element signaling pathway. To our knowledge, this is the fi rst insight into the subcellular localization, function and pathogenic role of structural and accessory proteins of MERS-CoV. According to a recent report, the replicase polyprotein of MERS-CoV is cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins ; it thus remains a possibility that one or more of these products also inhibit the interferon response, much like SARS-CoV (Devaraj et al., 2007; Wathelet et al., 2007; Frieman et al., 2009; Kamitani, et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2012) .",
