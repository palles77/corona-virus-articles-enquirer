(7) (8) (9) The prognostic value of low serum albumin may reflect ongoing inflammation, malnutrition or loss of albumin's protective effects (vasodilatation, inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis, antioxidant effects and reduced platelet aggregation). (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) While the role of inflammation in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains controversial, there is evidence that inflammation may be critical in this condition. (16, 17) Serum albumin is a negative acute phase protein and therefore a readily available marker of inflammation. (18) The acute phase response leads to the release of acute phase cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6), which acts via specific hepatic receptors to inhibit the synthesis of albumin. (18) In addition, IL-6, via a positive autocrine feedback loop, promotes the proliferation of lung fibroblasts. (19, 20) Other conditions, such as malnutrion and liver/kidney disease may also affect albumin levels. However, the association between hypoalbuminemia and mortality in patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) remains unknown.",

We used Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to examine the relationship between serum albumin at the time of listing and transplant waiting-list mortality rate, while adjusting for important covariates. Survival time was computed starting from the date of listing for transplantation. In our primary analysis, those who did not experience an endpoint (transplantation, removal/delisting or death before transplantation) were censored on August 1, 2007. Those who were transplanted were censored at the date of transplantation, and those who were removed from the list were censored at the date of de-listing. To examine the nature of the relationship between serum albumin concentration and mortality (whether there was a graded or threshold relationship), we categorized serum albumin concentration by quintiles, and regrouped the three middle quintiles into equi-spaced categories. The resulting five categories were: \u2264 3.3; 3.4-3.7; 3.8-4.1; 4.2-4.5; and \u2265 4.6 g/dL. Because a monotonic mortality trend was found across these five categories of serum albumin, we conducted Cox analyses with serum albumin as a continuous predictor. Models were adjusted for variables that influence survival in patients with IPF (age, gender, race, forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted, flow rate of supplemental oxygen required at rest [O 2 Req], six-minute walk distance [6MWD], mean pulmonary artery pressure [MPAP] as determined by right-heart catheterization [RHC], and lung allocation score [LAS]) (23) and variables that affect serum albumin (serum creatinine [SCr], body mass index [BMI], ever-smoker status, corticosteroid use, and diabetes mellitus). (10) Covariates were added to the model in three steps: 1) demographic variables; 2) measures of pulmonary status; and 3) conditions (or markers of conditions) that can affect serum albumin levels: BMI (as marker of malnutrition), SCr (as marker of renal dysfunction/proteinuria), corticosteroid use, diabetes mellitus, and ever-smoker status. Covariates with missing data were imputed using the mean or the mode of the distribution, and for each such covariate, we included a 0/1 indicator variable that flagged those with imputed values. In sensitivity analyses, we re-ran the final model after excluding those with imputed values (6MWD: 196; Ever-smoker status: 194; MPAP: 183; O 2 Req: 98; FVC % predicted: 26; corticosteroid use: 10, diabetes mellitus: 4). We added LAS to the final model to test if albumin has prognostic value independent of the LAS score. Since a major reason for removal from the transplant waiting list is worsening health, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which everyone who was removed from the list was treated as if he/she had died on the date of removal. To address the possible bias from censoring due to transplantation, we also performed sensitivity analysis in which we assumed that everyone who was transplanted died on the day of the transplantation. Further, we also performed sensitivity analyses including post-transplant survival, including a time-varying covariate for the performance of lung transplantation. In supplementary analyses, we examined selected interaction terms (age*albumin and gender*albumin). The proportional hazards assumption was assessed using log-log plots. All tests were two-tailed, and p values of < 0.05 were required for statistical significance. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and MedCalc for Windows, version 9.2.0.0 (MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium).",

IL-6 acts via specific hepatic receptors as a potent inducer of acute phase protein synthesis (C-reactive protein, amyloid-A) and simultaneously inhibits the synthesis of albumin.(18) Activated endothelial cells, monocytes/ macrophages and fibroblasts are the major sources of IL-6 during systemic inflammation (18) and IL-6, via a positive autocrine feedback loop, promotes the proliferation of lung fibroblasts.

            "text": "Our study has several limitations that need to be acknowledged. First, in an effort to isolate the effects of inflammation-related hypoalbuminemia, we adjusted for various non-inflammatory causes of hypoalbuminemia but were limited to the covariates that were available in the OPTN/ UNOS database. Some of these covariates may have been imperfect surrogates for those conditions. For instance, although we used BMI as a correlate of malnutrition, we were unable to directly assess nutritional intake. However, given the high BMI (27.2) of those with the lowest serum albumin levels, it is highly unlikely that they were clinically malnourished. Further, we used serum creatinine to adjust for urinary protein loss, since proteinuria was not measured. (27) Similarly, corticosteroid use and diabetes may have not accurately characterized factors influencing albumin synthesis such as endogenous cortisol and insulin levels.(10) Moreover, we could not adjust for hepatic dysfunction. While renal and liver dysfunction could have caused hypoalbuminemia in our study, this is less likely as patients with other solid organ diseases are usually excluded from listing for lung transplantation. We were also limited by our inability to directly assess inflammation via measurements of proinflammatory cytokine levels. Hence, in this study, the mechanism underlying the association between hypoalbuminemia and death is unclear. Future investigation will be required to determine the reasons for low serum albumin levels in patients with IIP. Another issue is that the diagnosis of IPF was not standardized. Although we suspect that our cohort was composed mainly of IPF patients, the patients in our cohort did not have rigorous documentation of IPF by the standards set forth by ATS/ERS, (28) and some likely had other IIP. Therefore, any comparisons between our results and other cohorts of well-defined IPF subjects should be made with caution. Nonetheless, diagnostic heterogeneity may actually increase the generalizability of our results to patients with IIP awaiting lung transplantation. Finally, a large group of patients underwent transplantation and were censored at the time of transplantation. This could limit the generalizability of our findings to all IIP mortality, and be applicable only to mortality while awaiting transplantation. However, the lack of an association between albumin and the probability of transplantation in this cohort indicates that our findings are not likely to have been biased by censoring at the time of transplantation, and that the albumin-mortality association documented here may be applicable to all IIP mortality. Consistent with this, after adjusting for transplantation as a time-dependent covariate and including post-transplant survival, low serum albumin remained strongly and independently associated with high mortality in IIP. Furthermore, in sensitivity analysis in which we assumed that everyone who was transplanted died on the day of the transplantation, low serum albumin also remained strongly and independently associated with high mortality in IIP. Some weakening was expected, as these estimates are underestimates of the real relationship between albumin and mortality, as they represent an overcompensation for the transplant censoring concern.",
