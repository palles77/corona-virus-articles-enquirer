We test a family of 10 commonly-used cosmetic products and find that volatile liquids and creams lower thermal skin temperature by at least 2 C for up to 5-10 min and at least 1 C for up to 20 min, respectively. Powder and cream that contains brightening agent lower indefinitely the skin temperature sensed by infrared camera. With the qualification that these experiments were performed in a controlled laboratory setting rather than the mass crowd screening environment where infrared temperature sensing of humans sees widespread use, our tests suggest that for human subjects whose face was treated with certain cosmetics and lotions, infrared-based screening for elevated facial temperature (fever) can be unreliable.",

The left panel (Fig. 1a) , a typical thermal image, shows skin temperature measured in different regions of the subject's face. One complication is that the subject inevitably shifted position of his head during the long measurement times, thereby presenting the possibility that the apparent temperature might shift owing to change in the measurement focus. To compensate for this possibility, we made differential measurements between two regions of the forehead, one blank region (cosmetic-free), one region to which cosmetics were applied. Showing the excellent reproducibility of the measurement over extended times, Fig. 1b illustrates apparent absolute temperature plotted against time. Naturally, this healthy subject's skin temperature of \u2248 34.35 C was below his body temperature, which was normal. Creams, powder. In Fig. 2 , the effect of applying cosmetic is considered. Depression of skin temperature is plotted against time after the cosmetic was applied. Cosmetic #1, marketed as a tone-up brightening cream, produced the largest depression of skin temperature. Skin temperature was depressed by at least 2 C for 15 min and 1 C for 20 min, likely because evaporation of volatile components lowers temperature. The evaporation rate was notably slow, perhaps because the volatile components (water) also dissolve in the skin. After the cosmetic had remained on the skin for 40 min, it was washed with cosmetic remover and strikingly, the skin temperature remained depressed by \u2248 0.8 C. This semi-permanent depression of skin temperature likely reflects the presence of residual solid-state brightener specified as an active ingredient in the product's marketing.",

Also it will be interesting and relevant, in future work, to understand the influence of the amount of cosmetic that is applied; as noted above, we simply employed thickness roughly that which we find in common use around us. The purpose of this report is to call attention to the importance of the phenomenon and to show that cosmetics disguise actual skin temperature. Finally, in future work it will be interesting and relevant to understand better the physical reasons behind the phenomena reported above. Human skin has very high emissivity, 0.98, close to 1. Lower emissivity (higher reflectivity) will result in a lower value of temperature measured by the infrared (IR) camera. The IR camera does not measure true temperature, but actually measures radiated light from the object, which is then material and surface property dependent These conclusions are important as they show that the temperature \"seen\" by infrared thermal screening can be easily disguised by common cosmetics. They are relevant to evaluating screening of human populations for the COVID-19 virus and other illnesses that cause fever. They suggest conclusions with two potential security implications:",
