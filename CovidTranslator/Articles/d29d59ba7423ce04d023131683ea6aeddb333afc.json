The aim of the study was to examine the influence of early CDVinfection on leukocyte depletion, lymphopenia and virus-induced cell death in dogs infected with a virulent CDV strain. From 10 infected dogs, peripheral blood leukocytes were harvested periodically, phenotyped and analyzed for CDV antigen content and apoptosis using Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide labeling. CDVinfection induced a severe CD3 + T cell and CD21 + B cell depletion in all animals at 3 days post-infection (d.p.i.). For dogs with severe distemper, developing virus persistence in the lymphoid tissue and central nervous system, this lymphopenia lasted until the end of the experiment. Increased levels of lymphocyte apoptosis were found at 3 d.p.i., and monocyte apoptosis at 6 d.p.i. This was more prominent in the group of animals with severe distemper. At 3 d.p.i. no leukocyte infection was detectable indicating that the early lymphocyte depletion and apoptosis was not a direct consequence of virus infection. Taken together, our results demonstrate that CDV-induced lymphopenia is an early event and that the degree of lymphocyte depletion correlates with the severity of disease and virus persistence in the lymphoid tissue and central nervous system. #",

The extent of the neuropathological alterations is influenced by the age and the immune status of the animal at the time of infection (W\u00fcnschmann et al., 1999; Krakowka, 1982; Appel, 1969) as well as the virus strain Summers et al., 1984; Vandevelde et al., 1982) . Previous pathogenesis studies identified an acute and a chronic stage of the development of CDVinduced demyelination. In the acute stage, it was shown that demyelination coincides with viral replication in glial cells, predominantly astrocytes (Zurbriggen et al., 1993a; Vandevelde et al., 1985) . With disease progression the inflammatory reaction in the demylinating areas leads to the chronic phase of distemper . It was previously speculated that an ''innocent bystander mechanism'' associated with the anti-viral immune response leads to the chronic progression of the disease (Griot et al., 1989) . Furthermore, it was shown that virus infection of oligodendrocytes is a rare event (Schobesberger et al., 2002; Glaus et al., 1990; Wisniewski et al., 1972) , but that a restricted infection of oligodendrocytes and neurons can occur leading to a non-cytolytic, persistent infection Zurbriggen et al., 1995) .",

Ten dogs were inoculated with virulent CDV strain A75/17 and monitored for up to 25 d.p.i. Based on CDV antigen expression in the CNS and in lymphoid tissues as well as in peripheral blood cells, two groups were formed: CDV-Ag + and CDV-Ag \u00c0 animals. The CDV-Ag + group exhibited moderate to massive expression of CDV antigen in brain and lymph node tissue, whereas in the other group (CDV-Ag \u00c0 ) despite mild clinical symptoms no antigen could be found in neither brain nor lymph node tissue using different methods of detection. It was also found that the occurrence of severe clinical symptoms correlated with antigen detection in brain and lymphoid tissues. A restricted infection of lymphoid tissue, unlike brain tissue, could not be demonstrated (Zurbriggen, unpublished observations) . The present study demonstrates that severe lymphopenia is a characteristic and particularly early event during infection of dogs with CDV. Even though the animals used in this experiment were immunized with a distemper DNA vaccine it is highly unlikely that the DNA vaccination had any effect on the measured parameters. An important finding was that the degree of lymphopenia correlated with the severity of the disease, virus colonization of the CNS and virus persistence in the lymphoid tissue. This indicates that such early events-and not only the long-lasting immuno-suppression-in the course of CDV infection are important for disease pathogenesis (Tipold et al., 2001) . Furthermore, it is likely that this impairs the immune response against CDV itself and also against other microbes, leaving animals highly susceptible to secondary infections (Appel et al., 1982 (Appel et al., , 1992 Krakowka and Wallace, 1979; Cornwell et al., 1965) .",

After The upper graphs show the data for the CDV-Ag \u00c0 group and the lower graph for the CDV-Ag + group, as defined in Table 1. double labeling of PBL with CDV and Annexin Vonly few CDV Annexin V + cells were found. A significant reduction of lymphocyte numbers in the blood of infected animals was observed as early as 3 d.p.i., before CDV viremia and infection of leukocytes was apparent. In general, the kinetics of the virus infection did not correlate with the kinetics of the lymphocyte depletion and cell death, respectively. Furthermore, on days 3 and 6 p.i. a distinct increase in apoptosis but not much virus was detectable. Consequently, the present study demonstrates that mechanisms other than a direct induction of cell death by the virus have to be considered. A comparison with lymphopenia induced by other viruses reveals some similarities suggesting that these effects might be caused by an immunological reaction common to several virus infections.",

            "text": "Our study is particularly interesting when compared to the closely related MV infection in humans. This disease is associated with an extensive lymphopenia with up to 90% of the lymphocytes disappearing from the peripheral blood. Numbers of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, B cells, neutrophils and monocytes are reduced leading to a temporary, MV-associated immunosuppression rendering humans highly susceptible to opportunistic infections (Okada et al., 2000; Niewiesk et al., 2000; Naniche et al., 2000; Nanan et al., 1999) . The mechanisms of MV-induced immune suppression are still not fully understood and are most likely multifactorial (Marttila et al., 2001) . It has been discussed that MV suppresses cell-mediated immunity by interfering with the survival and functions of dendritic cells and T cells (Fugier-Vivier et al., 1997) . Cell membrane-associated MV components inhibit antigen processing (Marttila et al., 2001) . It has been speculated that the production of a soluble factor can inhibit antigen-specific T cell proliferation and the proliferation of uninfected B cells (Fujinami et al., 1998) . However, the mechanism of MV induced lymphopenia is unknown. During natural infection the preferential target cells infected are monocytes and not lymphocytes (Nanan et al., 1999) , corresponding to the results obtained in the present study with CDV. In Measles, the number of MV-infected cells remains a minor population, and therefore cytolysis of viralinfected lymphocytes alone cannot explain the profound immune suppression. In the acute phases of CDV-induced lymphopenia this also appears to be the case. With Measles, it has been suggested that lymphopenia is primarily due to extended death of non-infected blood cells caused by apoptosis (Okada et al., 2000) . This again is related to the observation made in the present study with CDV. In the acute phase of many other virus infections a lymphopenia with characteristics as those presented here can be observed (Oldstone, 1996) . Examples include classical swine fever (Summerfield et al., 1998 , bovine viral diarrhea (Ridpath et al., 2000) , porcine Circovirus-2 infection (Nielsen et al., 2003) , influenza (Tumpey et al., 2000) , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Peiris et al., 2003) , foot and mouth disease (Bautista et al., 2003) , Dengue virus infection (Fadilah et al., 1999) , cytomegalovirus infection (Einsele et al., 1993) , and many others. Interestingly, in many cases a correlation of disease severeness and degree of lymphocyte depletion was observed. Based on this, the determination of lymphocyte numbers can have a prognostic value for the development of the disease. The mechanism of this lymphocyte depletion in the acute phase of virus infections is unknown. A nonspecific (over-)activation of the innate immune system to a rapidly replicating virus in a na\u00efve host might be involved. The effects could be mediated by overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and interferons, which in turn affect lymphocyte homeostasis.",
