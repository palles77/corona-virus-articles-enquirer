In this study, we demonstrate that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus replicase nsp2, and two nsp2-related \u22122/ \u22121 frameshifting products, nsp2TF and nsp2N, are hyper-phosphorylated. By mapping phosphorylation sites, we subdivide an extended, previously uncharacterized region, located between the papain-like protease-2 (PLP2) domain and frameshifting site, into three distinct domains. These domains include two large hypervariable regions (HVR) with putative intrinsically disordered structures, separated by a conserved and partly structured interval domain that we defined as the inter-HVR conserved domain (IHCD). Abolishing phosphorylation of the inter-species conserved residue serine 918 , which is located within the IHCD region, abrogates accumulation of viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs and recombinant virus production. Our study reveals the biological significance of phosphorylation events in nsp2-related proteins, emphasizes pleiotropic functions of nsp2-related proteins in the viral life cycle, and presents potential links to pathogenesis.",

It is estimated that up to 30% of the constituent proteins of the human proteome are modified by kinases (Ubersax and Ferrell, 2007) . Protein kinases mediate the transfer of the \u03b3-phosphate from ATP to specific residues (Ser, Thr, or Tyr) of target proteins (Humphrey et al., 2015; Hunter, 1995; Johnson, 2009; Tarrant and Cole, 2009; Ubersax and Ferrell, 2007) . As intracellular pathogens that replicate exclusively in live cells, viruses modulate phosphorylation-regulated signaling pathways in host cells. Viruses also utilize host phosphorylation machinery to modify viral proteins in order to establish a productive life cycle (Keating and Striker, 2012; Keck et al., 2015) . Phosphorylation of specific viral proteins regulates viral protein functionality, virus replication, and control of host cellular responses (Keating and Striker, 2012; Keck et al., 2015) . In nidoviruses, nucleocapsid (N) proteins of coronaviruses and arteriviruses have been shown to be phosphorylated, with potential impacts on viral RNA transcription (McBride et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2009; White et al., 2007; Surjit et al., 2005; Stohlman and Lai, 1979; Spencer et al., 2008; Peng et al., 2008; Mohandas and Dales, 1991; Chen et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2009; Calvo et al., 2005; Zeegers et al., 1976) . However, whether other nidoviral proteins are phosphorylated and the functional consequences of such phosphorylation events remain largely uncharacterized.",

Four virus-encoded protease domains direct the proteolytic processing. These include two papain-like proteases (PLP1\u03b1 and PLP1\u03b2) located in nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2, a papain-like protease (PLP2) domain located at the N-terminus of nsp2, and a serine protease (SP) located in nsp4. PLP1\u03b1 autocleaves between nsp1\u03b1/nsp1\u03b2, PLP1\u03b2 autocleaves between nsp1\u03b2/nsp2, and PLP2 cleaves between nsp2/nsp3. These autocleavage processes induce the rapid release of nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2 and nsp2 from the polyprotein. Recently, we identified two novel nsp2-related proteins, nsp2TF and nsp2N Li et al., 2014) . The nsp2TF is expressed through a \u22122 programmed ribosomal frameshift (PRF) mechanism, which accesses an alternative ORF (TF) through a frameshifting site that overlaps the nsp2-encoding region. The resulting transframe fusion protein consists of the N-terminal two thirds of nsp2 followed by a unique C-terminal domain that is translated from the novel TF ORF. At the same frameshifting site, \u22121 PRF also occurs, in which the \u22121 PRF encounters an immediate stop codon to generate a truncated nsp2 protein, termed nsp2N. Nsp2, nsp2TF and nsp2N all contain the PLP2 domain and the following region located between the PLP2 domain and the frameshifting site. Other cleaved nsp2 variants of smaller protein size have also been reported (Han et al., 2010) .",

Besides cleaving the nsp2/nsp3 site, the nsp2 functions as a cofactor for the SP to process the nsp3-12 region (Fang and Snijder, 2010) . In addition, PLP2 is capable of removing ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like modifiers like ISG15 (an Interferon-stimulated gene) from host cell substrates van Kasteren et al., 2012; Frias-Staheli et al., 2007) . The C-terminus of nsp2 contains a highly conserved Cys-rich domain of unknown function as well as a multi-spanning transmembrane domain that plays a role in the formation of membranous structures that facilitate viral replication (Fang and Snijder, 2010; Snijder et al., 2013) . The central region of nsp2 (which is also present in nsp2TF and nsp2N) contains hypervariable sequences, in which various deletions/ insertions have been reported (Fang and Snijder, 2010; Snijder et al., 2013) . Significantly, a cluster of immuno-dominant B cell epitopes and potential T-cell epitopes was identified within this region (Oleksiewicz et al., 2001; Fang et al., 2004) . In particular, highly pathogenic PRRSV variants exhibit specific signature-like variations, raising the possibility of connections between nsp2 sequence hyper-variability and viral pathogenicity (Fang and Snijder, 2010; Snijder et al., 2013) . However, the central region of nsp2 is poorly characterized in terms of its structure and function. In this study, we demonstrate that the PRRSV nsp2 and two nsp2-related PRF products, nsp2TF and nsp2N, are hyper-phosphorylated. By combining phosphorylation site mapping, disorder analysis and protein structural prediction, we divided the central region of nsp2 into three distinct domains, located between the PLP2 domain and PRF site. We determined that the central region contains two large hypervariable regions (HVRs) with putative intrinsically disordered structures, separated by a conserved and partially structured interval domain that we defined as the IHCD (Inter-HVR Conserved Domain). Importantly, we identified a highly conserved phosphorylation site (Serine 918 ) in the IHCD that is critical for viral replication. The results of our study expand the nidovirus phospho-proteome and reveal important roles for the phosphorylation of nsp2-related proteins in the regulation of virus replication, as well as potential effects on viral pathogenesis.",

The corresponding molecular weights in PRRSV-2 (strain SD95-21) are 129 KDa, 110 KDa, and 92 KDa, respectively (Fig. 1) . However, in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), we observed that the apparent sizes of nsp2-related proteins were substantially larger than the predicted molecular weights Li et al., 2018) . We therefore investigated whether post-translational modifications, in particular phosphorylation, affect the mobilities of nsp2-related proteins in SDS-PAGE. Nsp2-related proteins were immunoprecipitated (IP) from PRRSV-1 SD01-08-infected cells using a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that recognizes the N-terminal PLP2 domain region, which is common to all three proteins Fig. 1 .

Immunoprecipitated proteins were treated with \u03bb phosphatase (\u03bbPP) and compared to their untreated counterparts by SDS-PAGE and western blotting analysis. Dephosphorylation by \u03bbPP increased the apparent mobilities of all three nsp2-related proteins relative to the untreated samples ( Fig. 2A) , suggesting that the nsp2-related proteins are phosphorylated. Subsequently, we used a panel of anti-phosphoserine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to confirm the phosphorylation states of nsp2-related proteins. Anti-pSer mAbs #4A9 and #7F12 specifically recognized nsp2 protein, indicating that serine residues within nsp2 were phosphorylated. After \u03bbPP treatment, nsp2 bands with increased mobility were still recognized by mAbs #4A9 and #7F12 (Fig. 2B) ; however, the corresponding protein band intensities of the higher-mobility species of nsp2 were reduced by~63% and~49%, respectively (Fig. 2C) , indicating that the complement of phosphorylated serine/threonine residues of nsp2 were partially dephosphorylated after \u03bbPP treatment, yielding hypo-phosphorylated nsp2related proteins. It is noted that a new protein band appeared between nsp2TF and nsp2N after \u03bbPP treatment, but this band was not present before phosphatase treatment. We suspect that this may be another nsp2-derived variant with original size close to that of nsp2TF; after \u03bbPP treatment, this variant migrated differently than nsp2TF due to a different phosphorylation status.",

Since the N-terminal 714 amino acids are identical between nsp2 and Nsp2N (Fig. 1) , we did not subject the latter to mass analysis. Mass spectrometric data showed that PRRSV nsp2 and nsp2TF are hyperphosphorylated at more than eighteen sites, including ambiguous sites (Table 1) . Nsp2 contains eleven phosphorylation sites, while twelve sites in nsp2TF were identified. Mass spectrometric peptide analysis did not allow us to unambiguously distinguish between threonine 896 and serine 897 in nsp2, or between serine 1027 and threonine 1029 in nsp2TF. Among the identified sites, up to fifteen phosphorylated residues are located between the PLP2 domain and the \u22122/\u22121 programmed frameshifting site. This region is present in all three nsp2-related proteins. Residues serine 687 , serine 838 , serine 859 , serine 863 , serine 902 and serine 1010 are unambiguously phosphorylated in both nsp2 and nsp2TF. Tyrosine 1253 , threonine 1373 and serine 1440 are located in regions found only in nsp2, which include the predicted transmembrane (TM) domain and C-terminal domain. We assessed the conservation of these phosphorylation sites by quantifying their percentage of change in the genomes of other PRRSV isolates deposited in Genbank (Table 1) . Serine 579 , serine 827 , serine 838 , serine 859 , serine 863 , serine 897 , serine 918 , tyrosine 1253 and serine 1440 showed high conservation with less than 10% of changes (Table 1) .",

            "text": "To obtain insights into potential consequences and effects of nsp2related protein phosphorylation on viral replication, we closely analyzed the sequences of nsp2-related proteins. We focused in particular on identifying predicted functional and structural features of regions that contain key phosphorylated sites. The nsp2, nsp2TF and nsp2N proteins contain a relatively conserved PLP2 domain, a small hypervariable region (HVR-1) N-terminal to the PLP2 domain, and two large hypervariable regions (HVR-2 and HVR-3) between the PLP2 domain and the \u22122/-1 PRF site. The HVRs, by definition, diverge widely between species (Fang and Snijder, 2010; Snijder et al., 2013) , but can be defined as distinct domains because they are separated by a more conserved domain. Sequence analysis and structural modeling of HVR-2 and HVR-3 showed that these regions have low sequence Nsp2related proteins bound on Sepharose beads were treated with \u03bbPP and separated by SDS-PAGE. Anti-PLP2 mAb #36-19 was used for immunoprecipitation (IP). Anti-ES3-4 mAb #58-46 and anti-nsp2TF pAb were used in Western blots to visualize apparent size changes with and without \u03bbPP treatment. (B) Western blot (WB) detection of phosphorylation status of nsp2-related proteins with \u03bbPP treatment. Anti-pSer mAbs-#4A9 and #7F12 were used to detect the phosphorylation status of the protein (shown as green fluorescent signal in panel B3). To confirm the specificities of pSer mAbs, a pAb recognizing nsp2-related proteins was also used in WB analysis (shown as red fluorescent signal panel B3). Each panel shows a WB membrane from the transfer of an SDS-PAGE gel. Following the transfer, the membrane was cut and probed with different antibodies. (C) Pixel intensities of nsp2 bands were calculated using Image Studio 5.2 (Li-Cor Biosciences). complexity and a low probability to form stable secondary structures. Furthermore, HVR-2 and HVR-3 were consistently predicted to be intrinsically disordered by the disorder prediction algorithms Pondr-FIT, Pondr VL-XT (Bomma et al., 2012) , DISOPRED3 (Jones and Cozzetto, 2014) , MobiDB 3.0 (Piovesan et al., 2017) and metaPrDOS (Ishida and Kinoshita, 2008) (Table 2; Fig. 3 ). In contrast, a conserved region between HVR-2 and HVR-3 exhibits several consistent structural features (Fig. 3) . Based on structure prediction and sequence variation analysis, we define this region as an independent structured domain, termed the inter-HVR-conserved domain (IHCD). The N-terminal portion of the IHCD is predicted to primarily adopt random coil conformations, with relatively little predicted secondary structure (Fig. 4A ). The C-terminal portion of the IHCD is predicted to contain a structured fold putatively consisting of 4 or 5 helices (\u03b11-\u03b14 or \u03b14'). Moreover, three short peptides with uncharacteristically high inter-species conservation are present within the structured core ( Fig. 4A ; highlighted in grey color). Homology-based and ab initio structural modeling of the C-terminal portion of the IHCD using I-TASSER and Quark (Xu and Zhang, 2012; Yang et al., 2015) , yields a number of helical bundle models with distinct topologies (Fig. 4B) . A lack of proteins/domains of known structure and with high sequence similarity to the IHCD prevents us from evaluating the relative accuracy of these models. However, these models predict that extensive helix-helix interactions form a hydrophobic core and a stable, well-defined domain fold for the C-terminal portion of the IHCD. Of the phosphorylated residues described above, serine 667 , threonine 685 , and serine 687 are located within HVR-2, while serine 1010 , serine 1027 , and threonine 1029 are located within HVR-3. The N-terminal portion of the IHCD contains the phosphorylation sites Amino acids with bold font: identified phosphorylation sites in peptide analysis; *: ambiguously identified phosphorylation sites; #: phosphorylation sites that only exist in ORF1a reading frame; & Epitope sites were identified from previous study (de Lima et al., 2006) .

The phosphorylation site Tyr 1253 is located in a sequence that overlaps with the \u22122 ORF, although it is located within the nsp2-coding region. To avoid non-target mutation in the corresponding amino acid of nsp2TF, we introduced the Y1253F mutation into a previously constructed mutant (KO2), in which the expression of ns2TF and nsp2N was knocked out, but the nsp2 sequence was not affected . Using this panel of mutants, we first determined the impact of nsp2related protein phosphorylation on viral production. The full-length cDNA infectious clone of each mutant was transfected into BHK-21 cells and cell culture supernatant was harvested at 48 h post transfection, followed by measurement of viral titer. Compared to the wild type virus, the mutant S918A showed the lowest viral yield, with the titer decreased by one log (Fig. 5) .",

Initially, viral RNA was transcribed from the T7 promoter-driven cDNA infectious clone of the S918A mutant and transfected into BHK-21 cells. The expression levels of both plus (+) and minus (\u2212) strand gRNA and sgRNA were measured by qRT-PCR at 18 hpt. In comparison to the WT virus, the S918A mutant showed lower levels of (+) and (\u2212) gRNA, with (+) and (\u2212) mutant gRNA/WT gRNA ratios of 69.5% and 58.6%, respectively ( Fig. 6A and B) . The relative accumulations of three representative sgRNAs, sgRNA 2, 6 and 7, were significantly reduced in S918A transfected cells. The ratio of (+) sgRNA2/6/7 to (+) gRNA was reduced by 62.3%, 57.3%, and 47.6%, respectively (Fig. 6A) . Similarly, the relative ratios of (\u2212) sgRNA2/6/7 were reduced by 78.4%, 51.2%, and 60.1%, respectively (Fig. 6B ). To further confirm the importance of S918 phosphorylation on viral RNA expression, a phospho-mimetic substitution S918E was included in this assay. As shown in Fig. 6 , the S918E mutation showed higher levels of viral gRNA and sgRNA expression compared to that of S918A mutant. We obtained a similar result from virus-infected MARC-145 cells, in which S918A mutant showed large reduction in viral RNA expression compared to that of WT virus, while S918E mutant showed much less decrease in the level of viral RNA expression compared to the WT virus (Fig. S1 ). Reduced levels of viral RNAs should result in decreased expression of viral proteins. As expected, the expression levels of nonstructural protein (nsp1\u03b2) and structural protein (N protein) were decreased by about 52% and 64% in S918A mutant RNA transfected cells compared to those in WT virus (Fig. 7) . In contrast, the accumulated levels of nsp1\u03b2 and N protein were slightly decreased by the S918E mutation, with about 32% and 16% in S918E mutant infected cells compared to those in WT virus (Fig. 7) .",

At passage 2, we observed a significant increase of viral titer for the S918A mutant (4.57 log 10 FFU/ml at P1 versus 5.47 log 10 FFU/ml at P2), which reached levels similar to those of WT virus at P3 and P4 (Fig. 9A ). At P3, the S918A mutant showed similar plaque size as that of the WT virus in infected cells (Fig. 9B) , apparently recovering from its initially impaired growth ability caused by mutating the S918 phosphorylation site. Sequencing analysis of the nsp2 region showed that the S918A mutation is stable through different passages. However, we detected a second site mutation at amino acid 917 of nsp2 (H917Y, next to S918A), starting from passage 2 (Fig. 9C) . The sequence RRPRYAAQA generated from the second site mutation is a predicted phosphorylation site of Tyrosine kinase, suggesting that the H917Y mutation may provide an alternative, functionally redundant phosphorylation site to the site eliminated by S918A mutation. These results further confirm the important role of S918 phosphorylation in the viral replication.",

Viruses exploit host phosphorylation mechanisms to carry out critical viral functions and processes, including survival and replication (Keating and Striker, 2012; Keck et al., 2015) . The effects of phosphorylation of viral proteins on viral replication are broadly reported and have been characterized in both RNA and DNA viruses (Keating and Striker, 2012; Keck et al., 2015) . Previous characterization of protein phosphorylation in nidoviruses, including murine hepatitis virus (MHV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), equine arteritis virus (EAV), and PRRSV focused exclusively on the N proteins of these viruses (McBride et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2009; White et al., 2007; Surjit et al., 2005; Stohlman and Lai, 1979; Spencer et al., 2008; Peng et al., 2008; Mohandas and Dales, 1991; biological consequences of such phosphorylation events on viral replication were extensively investigated in coronaviruses (McBride et al., 2014) . For example, the phosphorylation state of the IBV N protein regulates its affinity for the viral leader sequence, suggesting that phosphorylation regulates RNA transcription in IBV (Spencer et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2005) . Phosphorylation by the host GSK3 kinase affects conformational transitions of the MHV N protein and regulates its interaction with the DDX1 helicase to fine-tune the discontinuous transcription of sgRNAs (Wu et al., 2014) . Phosphorylation of the N protein of PRRSV has also been reported (Wootton et al., 2002; Yoo et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2018 Chen et al., , 2019 . Phospho-ablatant mutations on two PRRSV N protein phosphorylation sites attenuated viral replication capability both in vitro and in vivo (Chen et al., 2018 (Chen et al., , 2019 . However, specific biological roles of PRRSV N protein phosphorylation remain largely unclear.",

            "text": "In our study, we demonstrate for the first time the importance of phosphorylation of PRRSV proteins other than N protein in viral replication. We determined that PRRSV nsp2-related protein phosphorylation critically modulates viral RNA expression, especially expression levels of sgRNAs. Previous studies demonstrated that nsp2 plays a primary role in viral replication by proteolytically processing replicase polyproteins through its PLP2 domain (Wassenaar et al., 1997) . Arterivirus nsp2 was also reported to play an important role in the formation of double membrane vesicles (DMVs) that anchor the replication transcription complex (Snijder et al., 2001 (Snijder et al., , 2013 Posthuma et al., 2008) . The identification of two additional frameshifting products, nsp2TF and nsp2N, increases the functional versatility and also the complexity of potential roles played by nsp2 (Snijder et al., 2013; Fang et al., 2012; Li et al., 2014 Li et al., , 2018 . We observed that all three nsp2-related proteins (nsp2, nsp2TF and nsp2N) are phosphorylated. Mutations introduced into the phosphorylation site serine 918 (S918A) attenuated viral replication in vitro. In particular, disrupting the phosphorylation status of serine 918 significantly downregulates steady-state levels of viral sgRNAs accumulation. Whether nsp2-related proteins, working as trans-acting factor(s), directly regulate arterivirus discontinuous transcription warrants further investigation. In PRRSV-infected cells, nsp2TF exhibits a different subcellular localization pattern than that of nsp2 . This suggests that the phosphorylation state of these proteins may regulate viral replication in different contexts, by different mechanisms, or that not all of the nsp2-related proteins are involved in sgRNA synthesis.",

            "text": "Compared with other conserved domains in nsp2-related proteins, the region between the PLP2 domain and \u22122/\u22121 PRF site is poorly defined in terms of structure and function. Based on sequence and structural prediction analysis, we subdivided this large region into two HVRs separated by a relatively conserved inter-HVR region that contains a highly conserved domain (IHCD) in both PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2. Previous studies examined the consequences of deletions introduced into segments that overlap with the HVRs and the IHCD. In PRRSV-1 (strain SD01-08), HVR-2 contains two known immuno-dominant epitopes, ES3 (residues 691-722 of pp1a) and ES4 (residues 736-790 of pp1a). HVR-3 contains the epitope ES7 (residues 1015-1040 of pp1a), while another epitope, ES5 (residues 822-832 of pp1a) is located within the N-terminal portion of the IHCD. In addition, the epitope ES6 (residues 895-923 of pp1a) is located at the junction of two portions of the IHCD (Oleksiewicz et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2010) (Fig. 4) . Our previous studies demonstrated that deletion of the ES3 epitope caused enhanced cytolysis and more vigorous in vitro growth kinetics, while ES4 and ES7 deletion mutants exhibited attenuated in vitro growth properties. In contrast, deletion of epitopes ES5 and ES6, located within the IHCD, was lethal and no viable virus was rescued. In vivo characterization of ES3, ES4, and ES7 deletion mutants in infected pigs showed levels of viremia consistent with the in vitro effects of epitope deletion. In addition, mRNA and protein expression levels of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 were downregulated in ES3 deletion mutant-infected macrophages . Another study identified specific regions of nsp2 that are dispensable for replication of PRRSV-2 (strain VR-2332) (Han et al., 2007) . Deletion of residues 707-906 in pp1a (residues 324-523 in nsp2) and 926-1015 in pp1a (residues 543-632 in nsp2), which overlap with HVR-2, resulted in viable recombinant viruses, but incurred severe fitness loss. Similarly, deletion of 1016-1109 in pp1a (residues 633-726 in nsp2), and 1110-1196 in pp1a (residues 727-813 in nsp2), which respectively overlap with the IHCD and partially overlap with HVR-3, also had severe effects on viral fitness (Han et al., 2007) . Furthermore, a deletion in the IHCD C-terminal portion (residues 1011-1130 of pp1a) that occurred naturally during an in vitro passage attenuated a highly pathogenic PRRSV-2 strain to an avirulent vaccine strain-TJM (F92) (Leng et al., 2012) . These results indicate that HVR-2/HVR-3 and IHCD potentially interact with the host immune system and that these regions are associated with viral fitness and replication ability.",

            "text": "Our sequence analysis showed that the region between the PLP2 domain and PRF site contains intrinsic disordered regions (IDRs), which have only low levels of sequence similarity to any other known proteins or protein domains. To investigate whether the hypervariable and potentially disordered nature of these regions in PRRSV apply to other arteriviruses, we used Pondr VL-XT software (Bomma et al., 2012) to analyze the sequences of representative species of five genera in the family Arteriviridae (Gulyaeva et al., 2017) . In all of these species, regions between the PLP2 and the putative transmembrane region TM1 are predicted to contain IDRs of variable length (Fig. S2) . Structural flexibility in the segments between PLP2 and TM1 seems to represent a general property of the nsp2-related proteins of the arterivirus family. In general, IDRs and IDPs (intrinsic disordered proteins) lack hydrophobic residues to support formation of well-defined and folded hydrophobic cores and do not adopt stable tertiary structures in the absence of binding partners (Wright and Dyson, 2015; Van Der Lee et al., 2014; Oldfield and Dunker, 2014; Uversky, 2013; Dyson and Wright, 2005) . Conformations of IDPs/IDRs are more typically represented as dynamic ensembles. Such disordered regions can present highly diversified binding sites for other macromolecular partners. As intracellular parasites, the life cycle of viruses depends critically upon interactions between viral proteins and host components. The absence of strong structural constraints correlates with less restriction on sequence selection and higher tolerance to sequence substitution, promoting sequence variability (Van Der Lee et al., 2014; Oldfield and Dunker, 2014; Uversky, 2013; Xue et al., 2014; Gitlin et al., 2014) . Furthermore, looser constraints on conformation permit dynamic display of post-translational modification sites, including phosphorylation sites, to facilitate transient interactions with modifying enzymes. Similarly, structural flexibility allows for ready access and recognition of modified sites for downstream interactions (Van Der Lee et al., 2014; Oldfield and Dunker, 2014; Uversky, 2013) .",

            "text": "The functional consequences of structural disorder are commonly found in the proteomes of viruses, especially for RNA viruses (Wright and Dyson, 2015; Van Der Lee et al., 2014; Oldfield and Dunker, 2014; Uversky, 2013; Dyson and Wright, 2005; Xue et al., 2014) . Structural flexibility can endow viral proteins from compact RNA genome with the ability to carry out multiple functions in viral life cycles, and is compatible with the low-fidelity transcription typically mediated by viral RNA polymerases (Van Der Lee et al., 2014; Xue et al., 2014) . For example, the Hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein NS5A contains two disordered domains (D2 and D3), which are believed to serve as protein-protein interaction (PPI) hubs (Shanmugam et al., 2018; Badillo et al., 2017; S\u00f3lyom et al., 2015) . The D2 domain interacts with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B and the host innate immune receptor Protein Kinase R (Shanmugam et al., 2018; Badillo et al., 2017; S\u00f3lyom et al., 2015) . Both D2 and D3 domains mediate the interaction between NS5A and the critical host factor cyclophilin A (CypA), facilitating the formation of an NS5A-NS5B transcription and replication complex. The disordered D2 domain tolerates large deletions without obvious fitness loss. In alphaviruses, the c-terminal region of nsP3 proteins contain a large hypervariable domain, which is also mostly disordered and hyper-phosphorylated (G\u00f6tte et al., 2018; Frolov et al., 2017; Rupp et al., 2015) . The nsP3 plays critical roles in the formation of viral replication complexes (vRCs) and also regulates RNA transcription. The HVD of nsP3 is enriched with functional PPI motifs, including a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-binding YXXM motif that interacts with the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and an SH3 domain-binding PXPXPR motif that interacts with host proteins of the amphiphysin family (G\u00f6tte et al., 2018; Rupp et al., 2015) . Importantly, repetitive motifs in the nsP3 HVD mediate critical binding to host stress granule (SG) proteins including G3BP1/2 and/or FXR family proteins (G\u00f6tte et al., 2018; Frolov et al., 2017; Rupp et al., 2015) . A growing number of studies show that disordered HVDs serve as PPI hubs, contributing to viral adaptation to the host environment, viral fitness and pathogenicity (G\u00f6tte et al., 2018; Frolov et al., 2017; Chetan et al., 2018) . In the case of PRRSV nsp2-related proteins, the two large putative IDRs associated with the HVRs and hyper-phosphorylation sites support the notion of a functional connection between sequence variability and mechanistic roles. Given that nsp2-related proteins contain the most apparent disordered regions in the viral proteome, the hyper-phosphorylated IDRs in nsp2-related proteins may function as evolutionary \"hot-spots\" for rapid adaptation to changing host environments, including immunological and physiological conditions, and to the very diverse range of host genetic backgrounds.",

            "text": "The disordered HVRs are separated by a conserved sequence region that we termed the inter-HVR conserved domain (IHCD). Unlike the HVRs, the C-terminal portion of the IHCD is likely to have a stable tertiary structure. Both homology modeling and ab initio structural predictions suggest that the C-terminal~100 residues of this region are primarily alpha-helical and that the helices pack as a bundle. The topology of the overall fold cannot be unambiguously predicted as multiple topologies allow for plausible helix packing and a buried hydrophobic core. However, all the prediction software generated similar results for the PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 sequences, suggesting that this region likely adopts a common domain fold in both species. In contrast to the C-terminal structured domain, the N-terminal~70-80 residues of the IHCD are predicted to contain little canonical secondary structure and may be conformationally dynamic or may adopt atypical tertiary structures. These sequences are relatively conserved within the PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 species. The conserved disorder and paucity of canonical secondary structure may be required for accessibility of the sequences to specific trans-acting factors and binding partners, including specific kinases that target the high density of phosphorylation sites in this region. It is noteworthy that the N-terminal portions of the IHCDs of PRRSV-1 and -2 sequences contain several instances of so-called PXDLS motifs. These linear motifs serve as binding sites for C-terminal binding proteins (CtBPs) (Chinnadurai, 2007) , which may potentially link nsp2-related proteins to CtBP-associated host chromatin regulators or transcription factors. The interaction of nsp2 proteins with CtBP was previously reported in two interactome studies on highly pathogenic Chinese PRRSV-2 strains (Wang et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2016) . To obtain further insight into the functional and mechanistic properties of the IDRs in HVR-2 and HVR-3, and the N-terminal portion of the IHCD, additional work will be needed to identify potential host interacting partners for these regions. Moreover, it will be important to characterize how phosphorylation near or within these segments modulates dynamic ensemble properties and protein-protein interactions of the HVRs and IHCD, and to correlate these to their effects on viral properties. The structured portion of the IHCD will need to be similarly investigated for several potential roles, including scaffolding or proteinprotein interactions with other nsp2 domains, with other PRRSV gene products and with host protein factors.",
