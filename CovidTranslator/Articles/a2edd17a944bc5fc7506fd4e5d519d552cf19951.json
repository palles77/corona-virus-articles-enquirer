Subject and methods In November 2009, we conducted an Internet-based cross-sectional survey of college students aged 18-24 years in a Midwestern State in the USA. We collected information on swine flu knowledge, perception on immunization safety, perceived efficacy of recommended behavior, changed behavior, and anxiety. Results Of the 236 respondents, 83.1% had some anxiety about swine flu, 64.8% believed avoiding crowded places was preventive, 33.5% believed the 2009 swine flu vaccine was safe, and 36.9% showed interest in receiving the vaccine. Misconceptions about swine flu contagion via eating cooked pork, water sources, and insect bites were common. Respondents were unaware of transmissions via contaminated objects and droplets. Only 42.6% were satisfied with governmental efforts. Women were more likely to wash hands frequently than men (odds ratio 2.80, p<0.001). Conclusion There is a gap in swine flu knowledge, minimal risk reduction, increased amount of anxiety, and skepticism about swine flu vaccine safety. These gaps warrant serious attention to inform the public about specific actions regarding swine flu.",

One study done earlier in 2009 among US military beneficiaries about the epidemiologic characteristics of novel H1N1 clearly showed that the strain appeared to preferentially affect adolescent and young adults between 15 and 24 years of age (Crum-Cianflone et al. 2009 ). At the inception of the epidemic, there were no vaccines available. Later, there were vaccines available free of charge for H1N1 influenza, and the CDC recommended the vaccine as the best preventive measure against H1N1 (CDC 2009a, b, c, d, e, f, g) . Transmissibility of the H1N1 virus has been shown to be substantially higher than that of seasonal flu (Fraser et al. 2009 ). Thus, it has become imperative to educate the public about measures of prevention of transmission of the H1N1 virus in order to mitigate its impact on the population.",

Motivating the public to adopt such behaviors as well as sustaining them can become daunting challenges. Studies of how people responded to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 suggest that perceptions or beliefs about an outbreak may be important in determining compliance with official advice. Different authors have cited the Health Belief Model (Lau et al. 2003; Tang and Wong 2003; Janz and Becker 1984; Rosenstock et al. 1988; Tang and Wong 2004; Lau et al. 2007 ) and the public's response during the outbreak of SARS (Lau et al. 2003; Tang and Wong 2003; Tang and Wong 2004; Lau et al. 2007 ) to suggest that people may be more likely to comply with health-related recommendations if they believe the following: the effects of the disease are severe; the recommended behaviors are effective (Tang and Wong 2004; Lau et al. 2007; Janz and Becker 1984) ; they are susceptible (Janz and Becker 1984; Rosenstock et al. 1988; Tang and Wong 2004) ; the illness is difficult to treat (Lau et al. 2007 ); the government is providing clear and sufficient information about the outbreak and can be trusted to control the spread of infection (Tang and Wong 2003) ; and there are few barriers to action (Janz and Becker 1984; Rosenstock et al. 1988 ). In addition, a higher level of anxiety or worry may be associated with an increase in behavior changes (Leung et al. 2005) . Thus, understanding the role of specific perceptions in motivating people to engage in precautionary behavior may help health communicators improve their messages about outbreaks of new infectious disease generally and H1N1 specifically (Rubin et al. 2009 ).",

Thus, we observed a very low level of knowledge even though the sample was fairly educated (all college students) and at an age that has been disproportionately affected by swine flu.

Even though the 1977 study was done in the general population, the results obtained were still higher than in our study in spite of the fact that our study was with those who were more at risk for H1N1 infection. Thus, we can say that public confidence about vaccines is probably much lower at present.

Another interesting finding was that women were more likely to adopt preventive behavior than men. Similar findings have been reported in one of the swine flu studies done in Europe (Rubin et al. 2009 ). Ethnicity was also associated with the adoption of preventive behavior. White people were more likely to adopt preventive behavior than other ethnicities. Because of the lower number of other ethnic participants, it is likely this finding may be biased. About 83.1% of people were little to very concerned about getting swine flu; this indicates high anxiety levels among young adults. This study also found that people who were more concerned were more likely to adopt preventive behavior, which implies that some form of anxiety is good. Perceived efficacy of preventive behavior was also a predictor of preventive behavior. That means people who believed that hand washing was effective in preventing swine flu were more likely to adopt the preventive behavior of hand washing. This finding implies that public health authorities should deliver messages of preventive behavior in such a way that makes their audience 100% confident about the effectiveness of that particular behavior. In this way, there would be a high chance of them adopting that preventive behavior.",
