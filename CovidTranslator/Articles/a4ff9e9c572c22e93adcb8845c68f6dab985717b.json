The MLPA technique employs two probes which ligate in the presence of target-specific complementary sequences. The probes consist of a target-specific sequence, common primer sequences and a stretch of nucleotides that allow specific detection based on length differences (Reijans et al., 2008) . The DPO technique employs targetspecific primers of double the normal oligo length which contain a polydeoxy-inosine linker to gain specificity and sensitivity for the multiplex detection (Drews et al., 2008) . In addition, positive detections by the MLPA and DPO assays were identified by two different automatic capillary electrophoresis detection systems. ",

Overall, peaks were sharper and seemed more pronounced by the Experion compared to those obtained by the Agilent.

            "text": "In conclusion: The MLPA assay has a greater sensitivity, is easier to interpret and has a greater success rate than the DPO (in particular when the DPO was combined with the Experion). The DPO needs less \"hands-on\" time than the MLPA. However, both assays are more rapid and sensitive than viral culture and are good alternatives for real-time RT-PCR.",
