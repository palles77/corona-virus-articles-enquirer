The 3\u00b75-year-old cat, positive for feline immunodeficiency virus infection, presented with a left testicular enlargement. A few months after castration the animal was humanely destroyed due to declining health. Post-mortem examination revealed inflammatory lesions in abdominal organs and in the brain compatible with FIP. Infection was confirmed with a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test and by immunohistochemical demonstration of coronavirus antigen in the affected tissues, including the left testicle. FIP is usually a systemic disease. However, lesions and presenting clinical signs in a single organ system such as the brain are not uncommon. The results of this case study indicate that orchitis, although rare, should be on the list of lesions of FIP.

The histopathological diagnosis was a unilateral pyogranulomatous and necrotizing orchitis. The cat received further antibiotic treatment, and again some slight but temporary clinical improvement was seen. However, the animal remained lethargic and when antibiotic therapy was discontinued it gradually lost appetite and developed neurological signs. The cat was humanely destroyed 4 1 2 months after castration. Post-mortem examination was performed at the Section of Pathology, National Veterinary Institute, Oslo. Macroscopic lesions, which were confined to the abdominal organs, were indicative of noneffusive FIP. The renal capsules were thickened Fig. 1 . Orchitis in a cat.
