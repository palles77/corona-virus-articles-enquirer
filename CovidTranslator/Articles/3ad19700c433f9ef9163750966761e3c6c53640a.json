            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is accompanied by severe lung inflammation induced by various diseases. Despite the severity of symptoms, therapeutic strategies for this pathologic condition are still poorly developed. Interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 is well known as an antiviral cytokine and low-dose IFN-\u03b1 has been reported to show antiinflammatory effects. Therefore, we investigated how this cytokine affected ARDS in a mouse model. C57BL/6 mice received sequential intratracheal administration of \u03b1-galactosylceramide (\u03b1-GalCer) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which resulted in the development of fulminant ARDS. These mice were then treated intranasally with IFN-\u03b1 and their survival, lung weight, pathological findings, and cytokine production were evaluated. Administration of low-dose IFN-\u03b1 prolonged survival of fulminant ARDS mice, but higher doses of IFN-\u03b1 did not. Histological analysis showed that low-dose IFN-\u03b1 treatment improved findings of diffuse alveolar damage in fulminant ARDS mice, which was associated with reduction in the wet/dry (W/D) lung weight ratio. Furthermore, IFN-\u03b3 production in the lungs was significantly reduced in IFN-\u03b1-treated mice, compared with control mice, but tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 production was almost equivalent for both groups. Low-dose IFN-\u03b1 shows antiinflammatory and therapeutic effects in a mouse model of fulminant ARDS, and reduced production of IFN-\u03b3 in the lung may be involved in the beneficial effect of this treatment.",

Direct lung injury has been reported to occur during infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus [3] or H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus [4, 5] . The serum levels of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and IL-6 were elevated in the cases of fatal human H5N1 influenza virus infection [6] , and several cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 showed strikingly increased concentrations in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids of these patients [7] [8] [9] .",

Recently, we reported an animal model of fulminant ARDS established by sensitizing mice with \u03b1-galactosylceramide (\u03b1-GalCer), a potent activator of natural killer T (NKT) cells, followed by a challenge with LPS [12] .

Based on an understanding of the involvement of these cytokines, various antiinflammatory agents, including corticosteroids [14, 15] , statins [16] , prostaglandin E1 [17] , neutrophil elastase inhibitors [18] , and inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism [19, 20] , have been tested for their clinical efficacy in ARDS therapy.

In the current study, we investigated whether IFN-\u03b1 affected the clinical course of fulminant ARDS mice. For this purpose, mice were treated with various doses of IFN-\u03b1 (100 IU, 1,000 IU, and 10,000 IU/mouse) or with PBS as a vehicle control 12 h before, simultaneously, and 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after LPS injection. As shown in Fig. 1 , all mice treated with PBS died within Next, we addressed the effect of IFN-\u03b1 administration on lung injuries developed in fulminant ARDS mice by conducting histopathological analyses. Using the results illustrated in Fig. 1 as a basis, \u03b1-GalCersensitized and LPS-challenged mice were treated with low-dose IFN-\u03b1 (100 IU/mouse) or PBS, and lung sections stained with HE were analyzed under a microscope 72 h after LPS challenge. As shown in Fig. 2 , massive infiltration of neutrophils not only into the intraalveolar septa but also into the alveolar spaces was observed in the \u03b1-GalCer-sensitized and LPSchallenged mice that received PBS treatment, whereas these inflammatory responses were strikingly attenuated when mice were treated with low-dose IFN-\u03b1. For an objective evaluation of the inflammatory changes, we quantified the histological changes of the tissue injuries using a Lung Injury Scoring System. As shown in Fig. 2b , the lung injury scores were significantly lower in low-dose IFN-\u03b1-treated mice than those in control mice. These results indicate that low-dose IFN-\u03b1 effectively inhibited the development of FARDS caused by \u03b1-GalCer sensitization and LPS challenge.",

            "text": "Infection with H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, is reported to cause fulminant ARDS with histopathologically defined diffuse alveolar damage in the lung, which is often refractory even to advanced medical therapy [4, 5] . This pathogenic condition is associated not only with viral replication in bronchial epithelial cells but also with uncontrolled production of inflammatory cytokines, the so-called \"cytokine storm\" in the lungs that is associated with a fatal outcome in many cases [4, 32] . Thus, control of excessive inflammatory responses may provide an effective therapeutic target against fulminant ARDS caused by the H5N1 influenza virus. Type I IFNs are synthesized and secreted by virus-infected cells, which upregulate the expression of antiviral genes and render the host resistant to this infection [21] . Recently, Haasbach et al. demonstrated that low-dose type I IFN treatment was effective in protecting mice from infection with H5N1 influenza virus [33] . Though this effect is thought to be due to the antiviral activity of type I IFN, it remains unanswered whether this treatment leads to suppression of the inflammatory response at the infected sites. In the present study, on the other hand, we examined the effect of type I IFN treatment on the fulminant ARDS developed by a mechanism unrelated to viral infection, which may aid in an understanding of its therapeutic potential via an antiinflammatory effect separate from antiviral activity, although it remains unclear if our model is valid for analyzing the pathogenic mechanism of fulminant ARDS caused by influenza virus infection and other clinically important conditions. In animal models of bacterial peritonitis [30] and acute lung injury associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage [31] , high-dose IFN-\u03b2 was used to demonstrate antiinflammatory effects. However, the present study showed that low-dose IFN-\u03b1 was effective in extending the survival time of fulminant ARDS mice. The antiinflammatory effects of lower doses of IFN-\u03b1, as recognized in our current study, have been reported in previous investigations in various animal models of inflammatory diseases [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . In in vitro experiments by Amadori et al. [38] , IFN-\u03b1 was shown to suppress the expression of a TNF-\u03b1 gene by swine alveolar macrophages at dosages as low as 0.5 IU/ml. The same investigators also reported that orally administered IFN\u03b1 suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 after weaning in piglets [39] . In contrast, in cattle, parenteral administration of high-dose, but not low-dose IFN-\u03b1, actually promoted inflammatory responses [40] . Taken together with these previous studies, our present findings suggest that lowdose administration of IFN-\u03b1 may exert antiinflammatory effects by inhibiting the production of proinflammatory cytokines, although the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the antiinflammatory effects of type I IFN. In previous studies by Quin et al., interaction of IFN-\u03b2 with its receptor was shown to trigger the induction of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), which then regulated IFN-\u03b3 synthesis by inhibiting the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT1\u03b1) [41] . Other investigators have also reported that the antiinflammatory effects of type I IFNs are mediated by the production of IL-10 [42] and by suppressing TNF-\u03b1 synthesis through the generation of tristetraprolin (TTP), an antiinflammatory protein [43] . In our study, the antiinflammatory effects of IFN-\u03b1 were not associated with alteration of TNF-\u03b1 synthesis, unlike the remarkable reduction of IFN-\u03b3 synthesis, and IL-10 was not detected in the lungs of mice in any of the groups (data not shown). In agreement with these results, we previously reported on the critical role of IFN-\u03b3, rather than TNF-\u03b1, which role was limited, in the pathogenesis of fulminant ARDS developed in \u03b1-GalCer-sensitized and LPS-challenged mice. In this model, NKT cells and Gr-1 + monocytes were involved in the synthesis of IFN\u03b3 [12] . These findings raise the possibility that IFN-\u03b1 may ameliorate the effects of fulminant ARDS by accelerating SOCS1 activation, which leads to the suppression of IFN-\u03b3 synthesis by NKT cells and Gr-1 + monocytes. However, in the present study, attempts to address the precise mechanism in the beneficial effect of IFN-\u03b1 remain to be made, and further investigation is needed to clarify this possibility.",

These results suggest that this cytokine could be a possible therapeutic option for ARDS, which is refractory even to advanced medical therapies currently available in clinical settings. In general, higher doses of type I IFNs are administered to patients with hepatitis virus infection and multiple sclerosis [44] [45] [46] . However, higher dose treatments are known to be associated with various adverse effects such as chills, fever, muscle aches, headaches, and depression. In this respect, less frequent adverse effects might be expected as an additional benefit of lower dose IFN-\u03b1 treatment. Thus, the present study may provide a significant impetus for further development of promising ARDS treatments.",
