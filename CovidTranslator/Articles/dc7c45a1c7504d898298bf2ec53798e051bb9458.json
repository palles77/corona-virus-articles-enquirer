            "text": "This study examines the impact of insider managerial ownership on financial performance of publicly traded tourist hotels in Taiwan. Insider managerial shareholding (IMS) includes two different classes of owners: managers and directors (i.e., managers' shareholding [MAS] plus directors' shareholding [DIRS]). The indicators of financial performance under consideration are return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), stock return (SR), and Tobin's Q. In addition to analyzing total insider managerial ownership (IMS), the study splits IMS into two components (MAS and DIRS) and examines each of them, separately. Subsequently, panel regression tests examine the effects of IMS, MAS, and DIRS on financial performance of Taiwanese tourist hotels. Test results suggest that IMS explains ROA, ROE and Tobin's Q, but not SR. Further, compared to MAS, DIRS has a more significant impact on hotel performance. Specifically, an inverted U-shape represents the effects of IMS and DIRS on hotel performance (ROA, ROE and Tobin's Q), indicating that both IMS and DIRS have a significantly positive impact on hotel performance up to an optimal point (supporting the convergence-of-interests hypothesis). Further, when IMS and DIRS are greater than their corresponding optimal points, these two factors can significantly deteriorate hotel performance (supporting the entrenchment hypothesis).",

On the one hand, the expansion of tourism activity was partly due to the increasing incomes of local residents (Chen et al., 2009; Hu et al., 2010) . On the other hand, Chen et al. (2009) stated that the governmental policy changes are another major factor causing an increase in the popularity of tourism activities. In 1998, the Taiwanese government implemented a two-day weekend policy for every other week and in 2001 implemented a two-day weekend, every week, policy. The prosperity of the tourism industry due to the expansion of both domestic and international tourism markets will likely create a significant demand for hotels and hospitality services, clearly leading to benefit for Taiwanese hotel companies.",

            "text": "The rapid growth of Taiwan's hotel industry spurred several financial studies in the hotel financial literature. Chen et al. (2005) studied whether or not a set of macroeconomic variables could explain hotel stock returns in Taiwan. They found that money supply growth rates and changes in unemployment rates are two significant explanatory factors for Taiwanese hotel stock returns. Pan (2005) examined how market structures of various related service markets and hotels' locations affect hotels' profitability. He indicated that market concentration in rooms could significantly improve international tourist hotels' profitability and the locations of the international tourist hotels significantly affect their profitability. Chen et al. (2007) tested the effect of the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on Taiwanese hotel stock prices. The results revealed that publicly traded hotel companies experienced sharp declines in earnings and stock prices during the SARS outbreak. Chen et al. (2005) detected that in addition to SARS, several other events related to the tourism industry, such as the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, the earthquake in Taiwan on September 21, 1999 and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in the U.S., significantly weakened hotel stock performance in Taiwan. Chen (2007a) showed that shifts in monetary policy could affect Taiwanese hotels' stock returns because monetary policy changes would impact changes in the expected level of future corporate earnings and/or the discount rate used in valuing expected cash flows of hotel companies.",

To accomplish the goal of expanding the financial literature of the Taiwanese hotel industry, this study investigates the influence of ownership structures (i.e., insider managerial ownership or insider ownership), on financial performance of hotel companies in Taiwan. Liu et al. (2006) stated that the power of managers in Taiwanese firms is quite high; managers tend to exercise significant control over the firm, and the agency problems can become problematic for shareholders. Fama and Jensen (1983) argued that the board of directors should exercise a supervisory authority over the managers, and the lack of oversight could result in, serious agency problems. Therefore, according to Fama and Jensen (1983) , the board should represent stockholders' and potential investors' interests, and override senior management's decisions, when appropriate. With consideration of this principal-agent relationship, an examination of a Taiwanese hotel firms' ownership structures (in particular, insider managerial shareholdings) may provide valuable insights in relation to firm performance.",

While the ultimate responsibility of managers is to maximize shareholders' value, directors' role is to oversee and evaluate the management's work and to make sure that the management's interests are aligned with shareholders' (Ross et al., 2007) . The influence of insider managerial equity ownership on corporate performance has had wide debate (for example, Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Demsetz, 1983; Coffey and Fryxell, 1991; Pound, 1992; Holderness and Sheehan, 1988) , but depending on the use of the convergence-of-interest hypothesis or entrenchment hypothesis, the resulting literature provided inconclusive findings regarding the effect of insider managerial ownership on firm performance. The convergence-of-interest hypothesis argues for a positive influence of insider managerial ownership on firm performance while the entrenchment hypothesis proposes a negative influence from insider managerial ownership on firm performance.",

The literature contended that diffused ownership yields significant power to managers whose interests do not perfectly coincide with the interest of shareholders. As a result, corporate resources are not always used for maximizing shareholders' value. This line of research continued with significant studies, such as Cosh and Hughes (1987) and Jensen and Murphy (1990) , in the past decades, and one of the major focuses of the literature has been the potential conflicts of interest between insiders and shareholders. A number of studies suggested that insider managerial ownership of shares in a firm generates two conflicting forces on management's behavior: the convergenceof-interest effect and the entrenchment effect (Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Fama and Jensen, 1983; Hart, 1983; Jensen and Ruback, 1983) .",

The stock held by insiders is an effective incentive to enhance firm performance and align managerial interest with shareholder value. Consequently, based on the convergence-of-interest hypothesis, the greater the proportion of shares owned by insiders, the better the firm performance should be. Mehran (1995) also provided evidence of a positive relationship between insider managerial ownership and firm performance, and similarly, Wruck (1988) suggested a strongly positive link between the change in concentration of insider managerial ownership and firm performance.",

Pursuing this argument, empirically, Demsetz and Lehn (1985) found no significant correlation between profit levels and various measures of ownership concentration in a sample of 511 US companies using 1980 data. Demsetz and Villalonga (2001) investigated the relationship between insider managerial ownership and firm performance when ownership construction was multi-dimensional and treated as an endogenous variable. They again found no statistically significant relationship between ownership structure and firm performance. This finding gains support from the view that while the diffused ownership may exacerbate entrenchment, it may also alleviate some agency problems at the same time: Disadvantages and advantages may offset, resulting in no significant effect. Tsetsekos and DeFusco (1990) constructed portfolios arranged according to insider managerial shareholdings and reported no significant differences in the returns among the various portfolios.",

Seven such hotels constitute the sample: Ambassador Hotel, First Hotel, Grant Formosa Regent Taipei, Hotel Holiday Garden, Leofoo Corporation, Landis Taipei, and Chihpen Royal, and all seven hotels are tourist hotels whose stocks are traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. These sampled hotel companies provided required financial data from the first quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 2009 (52 quarters). All data appears in the database of the Taiwan Economic Journal (TEJ). Consequently, 364 quarterly sample observations (7 hotels multiplied by 52 quarters) are available for this study's main analysis. Insider managerial shareholdings (IMS) were measured as the percentages of total shares held by managers and directors (or insiders). Therefore, the total shares further divide into two categories: managers' shareholdings (MAS) and directors' shareholdings (DIRS), and this study examines not only the total insider managerial shareholdings, but also the two separate categories of insider shareholdings, MAS and DIRS. Fig. 1 illustrates the time trend of average IMS, DIRS and MAS of seven hotels from the first quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 2009. As shown in Fig. 1 , mean IMS, DIRS and MAS increase over the period from the first quarter of 1997 to the first quarter of 2000, then decrease and maintain at a stable level.",

In addition to analyzing total insider managerial ownership, the study split insider managerial ownership into two components (directors' and managers' ownership) and examined each of them, separately.

Unless the industry anticipates a nationwide economic hardship in the short-term, the hotel industry in Taiwan may want to encourage hotel companies to increase exercising general shareholding with directors, thus approach more closely the proximity of the optimal point in terms of value performance. However, this suggestion should be certainly implemented with a clear consideration of unique situations of each hotel. Moreover, it is possible that changing shareholding patterns initiated by shareholders may face some difficulties because some directors hold significant portions of shares and thus exercise critical power in making such decision. Nevertheless, understanding that executives' and financial managers' ultimate goals are to increase shareholders' value (i.e., firm value), an enhancement of a firm's value performance may be given priority over other performance measures such as accounting performance, and any attempts to achieve that goal by, such as, accomplishing the optimal point of insiders' or directors' shareholdings, the industry may, in general, improve its performance as a whole and thus its significance in the Taiwanese economy.",

Sheu and Yang (2005) used productivity as a proxy for a firm's performance in examining the effect of insider ownership structure, and found no influence of total insider ownership or boards' shareholding on productivity.

Again, results of the analysis without control variables demonstrate qualitatively the same results (Panels B and D of Tables 7 and 8). The quadratic relationship, in particular, appears to be an inverted U-shape between DIRS and ROA (ROE and Tobin's Q) (i.e., the coefficient is negative). On the other hand, results of Model 3 (MAS) provide a different picture; MAS demonstrates a statistically significant relationship with none of the four corporate performance measures, with or without control variables.
