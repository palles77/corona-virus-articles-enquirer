PCR can also give falsenegative results and fewer diagnoses in those patients with pertussis could be due to the quality of the sample.",

Other pathogens that cause a pertussis-like disease have previously been described using serological assays and Cherry et al. describe that pertussis can be misdiagnosed, as there are a number of viral and bacterial pathogens other than B. pertussis that can cause a paroxysmal cough [1, 2] . It has been well described that PCR is more sensitive than culture at detecting B. pertussis in the acute phase [3] . The use of PCR for diagnosis would help improve microbiological diagnosis, improve the speed of results, and reduce the need for the reliance on imperfect clinical criteria for diagnosis. This would prompt more appropriate treatment of B. pertussis and other atypical bacteria, differentiating them from viral infections as well as use of vaccination to prevent spread of pertussis.",
