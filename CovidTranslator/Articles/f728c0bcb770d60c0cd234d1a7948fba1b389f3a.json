            "text": "Objectives: To determine efficacy and safety of withholding antimicrobials in children with cancer, fever and neutropenia (FN) with a demonstrated respiratory viral infection. Methods: Prospective, multicentre, randomized study in children presenting with FN at five hospitals in Santiago, Chile, evaluated at admission for diagnosis of bacterial and viral pathogens including PCRmicroarray for 17 respiratory viruses. Children positive for a respiratory virus, negative for a bacterial pathogen and with a favourable evolution after 48 h of antimicrobial therapy were randomized to either maintain or withhold antimicrobials. Primary endpoint was percentage of episodes with uneventful resolution. Secondary endpoints were days of fever/hospitalization, bacterial infection, sepsis, admission to paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and death. Results: A total of 319 of 951 children with FN episodes recruited between July 2012 and December 2015 had a respiratory virus as a unique identified microorganism, of which 176 were randomized, 92 to maintain antimicrobials and 84 to withdraw. Median duration of antimicrobial use was 7 days (range 7 e9 days) versus 3 days (range 3e4 days), with similar frequency of uneventful resolution (89/92 (97%) and 80/84 (95%), respectively, not significant; OR 1.48; 95% CI 0.32e6.83, p 0.61), and similar number of days of fever (2 versus 1), days of hospitalization (6 versus 6) and bacterial infections throughout the episode (2%e1%), with one case of sepsis requiring admission to PICU in the group that maintained antimicrobials, without any deaths. Conclusions: The reduction of antimicrobials in children with FN and respiratory viral infections, based on clinical and microbiological/molecular diagnostic criteria, should favour the adoption of evidencebased management strategies in this population.

In paediatric patients with cancer, respiratory viruses can be detected in up to 57% of episodes of FN [6,7,10e15] . In a previous study we determined the frequency and clinical outcome of respiratory virus-positive FN episodes [6] . Respiratory viruses were the most common agents detected and clinical outcomes of these episodes were significantly better than episodes with single bacterial infections or viralebacterial co-infections. Children with respiratory viral infections had fewer days of hospitalization, a lower probability of haemodynamic instability and lower rates of admission to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) [6] .",

In contrast with the increase in studies of bacterial and fungal infections in this population, studies of viral infections are scarce and have been recognized as a research gap in the field [1] . A rational approach towards the management of a potential infection in children with cancer and FN requires a comprehensive analysis of all microbiological agents involved.

Forty-eight hours later, 176/319 (55%) of these episodes met all criteria for randomization, of which 92/176 (52%) were randomized into a current antimicrobial management and 84/176 (48%) into antimicrobial withholding. At the time of randomization, median ANC was 132/ mm 3 and 207/mm 3 in the maintenance and withholding antimicrobial groups, respectively (p 0.15), with 87% and 80% of children having an ANC 500/mm 3 in each group (p 0.3).

Another possible issue is that not all children randomized in this cohort with respiratory virus detection presented an upper or lower respiratory tract infection at the time of admission.
