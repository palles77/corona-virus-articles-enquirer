            "text": "Coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales) are enveloped viruses with a linear, non-segmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA. The RNA genomes are the largest genomic RNA molecules known to date (27-31 kb). These viruses are divided into three distinct groups named 1, 2, and 3. Five types of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been described: HCoVs-229E and OC43 have been recognized since the mid-1960s and belong to groups 1 and 2, respectively. Recently, three other human coronaviruses were discovered. The SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified in 2003 during a worldwide epidemic starting from the Guangdong province (Ksiazek et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003) . In 2004, another group 1 coronavirus, HCoV-NL63 was reported in the Netherlands (Fouchier et al., 2004; Van der Hoek et al., 2004) . In January 2005, a new group 2 coronavirus, HCoV-HKU1, was found in two patients suffering from pneumonia in Hong-Kong (Woo et al., 2005) . Most of the seroepidemiological studies on human classical coronaviruses were conducted in 1970s using neutralization on cell cultures, hemagglutination inhibition or complement fixation methods, which are labor intensive and time consuming. As there is no available validated test as yet, it is necessary to develop a serological test for the detection of HCoV-OC43 antibodies to obtain recent data about the seroprevalence of this virus in the population. Development of new serodiagnostic tests requires the use of viral proteins. But the cultivation of HCoV-OC43 is difficult and does not allow for the production of large quantities of viral antigen. The objective here is to describe the expression of a recombinant nucleocapsid protein of HCoV-OC43 in a baculovirus/insect cell system and the development of a Western blot immunoassay for the detection of human antibodies against HCoV-OC43.",

HCoV-OC43 was propagated by inoculation into a 1-day cultivated human rectal tumour cells (HRT18) and incubated for 48 h or 72 h at 35 \u2022 C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco TM ) supplemented with 2% foetal bovine serum, HEPES 20 mM (EUROBIO TM ), NaHCO 3 0.1% and antibiotics. Propagation of recombinant baculovirus and expression of N recombinant protein were made in Spodoptera frugiperda derived Sf21 cell line. Sf21 was maintained in suspension or adherent cultures in Grace's insect cell culture medium (Gibco TM ) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. BaculoDirect TM C-Term Linear DNA (Invitrogen) derived from Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) DNA was used to build the recombinant baculovirus. It allows transferring gene of interest from the entry plasmid to the baculovirus DNA directly in vitro without the need of recombination in bacterial cells, using specific recombination sites from bacteriophage lambda. The presence of Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (HSV1tk) and lacZ gene located between the two recombination sites allows to inhibit replication of non-recombinant baculovirus in presence of ganciclovir, and to determinate viral purity using \u2424-galactosidase staining (Godeau et al., 1992; Lalumiere and Richardson, 1995) . The expressed protein is placed in fusion with a tag containing hexahistidine and V5 epitope sequence (a 14 amino-acid peptide derived from the proteins P and V of the simian paramyxovirus SV5) allowing to detect and purify the recombinant fusion protein Southern et al. (1991) .",

For the detection of SARS-CoV, several commercial kits are available. \"Classical\" coronaviruses are more often responsible of upper and mild respiratory tract illnesses, but can also be responsible for severe infections (Pene et al., 2003; Vabret et al., 2003) . Current diagnosis of acute coronaviral infection is based on molecular methods (Vabret et al., 2001) . Results from epidemiological surveys conducted in the 1970s have led to the conclusion that these viruses are worldwide in distribution, that seroprevalence increases rapidly during childhood reaching up to 90% in adults (McIntosh et al., 1970; Hasony and Macnaughton, 1982) . Nevertheless, these studies were carried out more than 25 years ago, and it would be useful to collect recent data. To this end, we decided to develop new tools for epidemiological studies. In order to produce monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and also to make immunoassays, we have chosen to express recombinant nucleocapsid protein of HCoV-OC43. Nucleocapsid protein was chosen because it is the most abundant structural protein in infected cells and its production is important during the whole infection cycle. Furthermore, the immunogenicity of this protein induces the production of high titer antibodies (Laude and Masters, 1995) . Baculovirus expres-sion systems have often been used to express large quantities of recombinant proteins. Expressed proteins are antigenically close to native proteins because of the post-translational modifications, similar to those observed in mammalian cells. Furthermore, baculovirus-expressed nucleocapsid proteins have been successfully used as antigens in ELISA-based assays for detection of antibodies specific of many virus including SARS-CoV and several animal coronaviruses (Carattoli et al., 2005; Guy et al., 2002) . The recombinant baculovirus containing HCoV-OC43 N gene, boc26, produced two proteins (54 and 60 kD). The predicted molecular weight of the recombinant HCoV-OC43 N protein was determined to be 54 kD, including C-terminal tag. The size of the recombinant protein determined by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblot analysis is approximately the same as the predicted size. The presence of these two proteins has already been described (Laude and Masters, 1995; Liu et al., 2001) . Studies on the biosynthesis of coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins in infected cells have revealed the presence of one major intracellular form, and of several related polypeptides. The presence of these two proteins on the Western blot can result from proteolytic cleavage at preferential sites, premature termination or translation of deleted transcripts (Laude and Masters, 1995) . The fact that anti-BCoV directed against nucleocapsid specifically recognizes both recombinant proteins assured that these proteins were antigenically similar.",

Today, there are two identified group 2 human coronaviruses: HCoVs OC43 and HKU1. The latter virus has been identified recently, precisely in January 2005. No adapted cell-cultured strain could be obtained, and no antibody against HCoVs HKU1 is available. Thus, even if the cross-reactivity could not be excluded, it cannot be verified today. Then, it is important that the assay is specific for OC43 and is not influenced by binding of antibodies directed to the V5 epitope. Neither a control-protein nor V5 epitope is available. In order to verify that there is no reactivity with V5 epitope in our test, we looked for human sera negative in this test. We tested five sera sampled from 2 to 3-year-old children. At this age, 100% of children are known to have already been infected by paramyxoviruses such as respiratory syncytial virus and thus carry antibodies against these viruses. Three of these five sera tested negative for the serological test (WB). These results suggest that our assay is specific for OC43 and is not influenced by the paramyxovirus V5 epitope. As expected, our study confirms that the seroprevalence against HCoV-OC43 in adults is really high. However, it would be interesting to test more serum samples from children to determine the mean age of seroconversion.",
