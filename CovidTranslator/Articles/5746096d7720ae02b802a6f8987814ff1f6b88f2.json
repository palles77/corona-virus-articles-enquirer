Members of the Reoviridae are large, complex particles, often having a diameter greater than 700 A. Capsids have an icosahedral architecture and are composed of multiple proteins arranged generally in concentric layers. None of the mature viruses in this family contain a lipid envelope. Genomes consist of 10 to 12 segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) packed within the core of the virion, and each segment generally encodes only one protein. Like other dsRNA viruses, members of the Reoviridae also have an endogenous transcription apparatus that operates within the viral interior.

However, related studies on several other types of dsRNA viruses have also provided substantial insights. These viruses include cystovirus ~6 of the plant pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola and L-A virus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Unlike members of the Reoviridae, which have between 10 and 12 monocistronic genome segments, ~6 has three polycistronic segments, and L-A virus contains only a single polycistronic segment. Because both ~06 and L-A virions share striking similarities with members of the Reoviridae, and because of the greater extent to which the genetics and molecular biology of these systems may be manipulated, these two viral systems have also made significant contributions to the understanding of the way in which dsRNA viruses progress through the important stages of their life cycles.

Biochemical and structural studies carried out on many types of segmented dsRNA viruses suggest that, despite differences in viral architecture, the basic events surrounding the process of endogenous genome transcription are notably similar. The results obtained from studying transcription in one viral system are often applicable to the entire family as a whole, and together these studies have helped to provide a better picture of the way in which segmented dsRNA viruses accomplish this important step in their life cycles.",

The innermost capsid layer is formed by 120 molecules of a 102 kDa protein VP2 arranged as 60 dimers on a T=I icosahedral lattice (Lawton et al., 1997b) . Such an organization with two molecules in the icosahedral asymmetric unit has also been referred to as a 'T=2' structure (Grimes et al., 1998) . This protein shell is believed to define the basic icosahedral architecture of the virus, as VP2 is the only rotavirus protein capable of self-FIG 4.1. Three-dimensional structures of the mature infectious rotavirus particle and the transcriptionally competent subviral particle. (Left) The mature rotavirus particle consists of three concentric capsid layers. In this illustration, produced from a threedimensional reconstruction of rotavirus at 24 ,~ resolution, the inner capsid protein VP2 is shown in green, the intermediate capsid protein VP6 in blue, and the outer capsid protein VP7 in yellow. The VP4 spike proteins are shown in orange. The transcription enzymes VP1 and VP3, along with the eleven genomic dsRNA segments, are housed in the interior within the VP2 capsid layer. (Center) Rotavirus enters the cell by penetration of the plasma membrane, and as a consequence of cell entry, the outer capsid proteins VP7 and VP4 are removed. (Right) Once inside the cell, the resulting subviral particle becomes transcriptionally active, releasing capped mRNA transcripts into the cytoplasm. See also color insert. assembling into stable virus-like particles (VLPs) (Labb~ et al., 1991; Crawford et al., 1994) . The VP2 layer serves as a scaffold for the assembly of the intermediate layer, which consists of 780 copies of a 45 kDa protein (VP6) arranged as 260 trimers on a T=13(levo) icosahedral lattice. The addition of VP6 protein to VLPs formed from VP2 imparts greater morphological homogeneity and long-term stability to the particles , suggesting that VP6 may play a major role in providing structural integrity to the rotavirus capsid. The icosahedral organization of the VP6 capsid layer defines a set of channels leading to the viral interior; these channels play an important role in the transcription process, facilitating the import of RNA precursor molecules and the export of mRNA transcripts (Prasad et al., 1988) . The outermost capsid layer in the mature particle consists of 780 copies of a 37 kDa glycoprotein VP7 assembled in a 1:1 stoichiometry onto the top of each VP6 molecule. The outer capsid layer also contains 60 dimers of VP4, which form spikes extending 120 A outward from the viral surface (Prasad et al., 1990; Shaw et al., 1993; Yeager et al., 1994) .",

The VP6 structure is similar to the structure of the homologous VP7 protein in the orbivirus bluetongue virus (Grimes et al., 1995) . The rotavirus VP6 protein folds into two distinct domains of roughly equal size. The upper domain, which interacts with the outermost capsid protein VP7 in the mature particle, folds into an eight-stranded ~-barrel structure, a motif often seen in viral capsid proteins. The upper domains of the individual monomers interact closely with one another to stabilize the trimeric structure of VP6. At the base of the trimer, the contacts between monomers are sparse with a large cavity along the 3-fold axis of the trimer. The lower domain of VP6, composed of several a helices, interacts with the underlying VP2 capsid layer as well as with neighboring trimers. Combination of the X-ray crystallographic structure of VP6 with the structure of the native virus determined using electron cryomicroscopy suggests that the VP6 molecule may function like a tripod in which the domains forming the base of the trimers are capable of slight adjustments to adapt to various quasi-equivalent locations on the T=13 icosahedral surface lattice of the viral capsid. This feature also allows the VP6 to compensate for the symmetry mismatch between the VP6 (T=13) and VP2 (T=I) layers of the virion.",

Because the configuration of the capsid in the transcriptionally competent virion differs from one type of dsRNA virus to another, the term transcriptionally competent particle (TCP) is used in this review to describe the structural form of the virus that normally functions during the viral life cycle to transcribe the genome.",

Like the rotavirus TCP, the bluetongue virus TCP consists of two capsid layers enclosing the viral genome and the endogenous transcription enzymes. The outer capsid layer in the bluetongue virus TCP is composed of 780 copies of a protein VP7 arranged as trimers on a T=13 (levo) icosahedral lattice, and the inner capsid layer is composed of 120 copies of a protein VP3 arranged as dimers on a T= 1 icosahedral lattice. The VP3 protein folds into a thin, relatively flat structure having the shape of a narrow triangular wedge. Each protein is composed of three distinct domains, each domain having a unique fold unlike that of any other reported protein structure. The VP3 capsid layer is most flexible in the region surrounding the icosahedral vertices. Some of the internal features of the virion corresponding to the dsRNA genome and the enzymes involved in transcription are also partially visible in the viral interior.",

            "text": "The three-dimensional structure of orthoreovirus has also been extensively studied (reviewed in Nibert, 1998) . Like rotavirus, mature orthoreovirus particles may be described as having three concentric capsid layers, although the radial boundaries between the capsid regions in orthoreovirus are not as readily apparent because of a greater degree of interdigitation among capsid proteins belonging to different layers. The innermost capsid layer consists of 120 molecules of ~.1 arranged as dimers on a T=I icosahedral lattice, much like the VP2 capsid layer of rotavirus. Unlike rotavirus, however, the inner capsid layer also contains 150 copies of a protein ~2, of which 120 associate in a 1:1 stoichiometry with ~.1, and 30 are positioned at the icosahedral 2-fold axes (Reinisch et al., 2000) . The intermediate capsid layer, roughly equivalent to the VP6 layer of rotavirus, is formed by 600 copies of ~tl, which are organized as trimers on an incomplete T=13 (levo) icosahedral lattice. The icosahedral distribution of pl trimers is described as \"incomplete\" because the protein is excluded from the regions immediately surrounding the icosahedral vertices, where instead of pl, a turret-shaped pentamer of ~,2 extends from the viral core through the intermediate capsid layer. The outermost capsid layer, similar to the VP7 layer of rotavirus, is composed of 600 copies of ~3 assembled in a 1:1 stoichiometry onto the underlying pl protein. The mature orthoreovirus particle also contains trimers of a long flexible spike protein ~1, anchored at each of the icosahedral vertices and extending up to 400 away from the periphery of the particle. Unlike rotavirus and orbivirus, in which the transcriptionally competent form of the virus consists of two complete capsid layers, the capsid structure in the transcriptionally competent orthoreovirion consists only of the inner ~,1/~2 capsid layer and the ~2 turrets at the icosahedral vertices (Dryden et al., 1993) . The atomic structure of the orthoreovirus TCP has been determined recently (Reinisch et al., 2000) and, when compared with the atomic structure of bluetongue virus, will provide additional insight into the manner in which mRNA production occurs in dsRNA viruses. The TCP of aquareovirus is likely to have a similar structure with that of orthoreovirus (Nason et al., 2000) . The capsid configuration of the mature cypovirus, which has only a single capsid layer and is transcriptionally competent, also shows many remarkable similarities with the TCP of orthoreovirus, including turret-like structures at the icosahedral vertices (Zhang et al., 1999; Hill et al., 1999) .",

A similar methylated cap structure is also observed in orthoreovirus , cypovirus (Furuichi and Miura, 1975) , and orbivirus (Mertens and Sanger, 1985) . All of the segments contain one functional open reading frame (ORF), and some segments contain alternative translation initiation sites that are also used. Both of the untranslated regions upstream and downstream of the ORF in each segment contain conserved sequences that are believed to function as important signals during genome assortment, replication, and packaging (Patton et al., 1997) . Transcription in rotaviruses, as in the other members of the Reoviridae, is conservative; all transcripts are synthesized de novo and represent precise end-to-end copies of the plus strands from the eleven genome segments (McCrae and McCorquodale, 1983) . Interestingly, in cystovirus ~6, transcription is semiconservative; as mRNA synthesis occurs, the plus strand from the dsRNA genome is displaced and translocated out of the particle to become the mRNA transcript (Emori et al., 1980; Usala et al., 1980; Van Etten et al., 1980) .",

In this way, genome transcription and genome replication may be thought of as complementary processes and in fact appear to use much of the same enzymatic machinery. This relationship between transcription and replication is being understood in greater detail from studies conducted using cystovirus ~6 Van Dijk et al., 1995; Qiao et al., 1997; Mindich, 1999) , where a complete viral reconstitution system is available to allow recovery of infectious virions from mRNA transcripts or cDNA clones of the viral genome (Olkkonen et al., 1990) . Although no reconstitution system is yet available for any of the reoviruses, studies conducted using baculovirusexpressed recombinant rotavirus-like particles containing the viral RNA polymerase coexpressed with the inner capsid protein have begun to clarify the mechanism by which the dsRNA genome is synthesized from the mRNA templates in rotavirus Patton et al., 1996; Zeng et al., 1996) .",

This phenomenon was first observed in the context of mammalian orthoreoviruses. Biochemical analysis of mature virions revealed that a substantial proportion of the nucleic acid present in the particle consisted of single-stranded oligonucleotides ranging in length from 3 to 20 bases (Bellamy et al., 1972) . These short oligonucleotides were believed to be the result of reiterative transcription initiation events that occurred in vivo within maturing particles during the assembly of the outer capsid. Completion of the outer capsid layer was believed to have halted transcript elongation, and the aborted transcripts then remained trapped within the viral core. Under transcription conditions in vitro, mature orthoreovirus particles are observed to produce short oligonucleotides corresponding in sequence to the extreme 5\" end of the genome segments, and some of these transcripts are properly capped (Yamakawa et al., 1982) . Likewise, orthoreovirus TCPs also produce a significant molar excess of short oligonucleotides in addition to full-length transcripts under transcribing conditions in vitro (Yamakawa et al., 1981; Zarbl et al., 1980) . Short oligonucleotide transcription products have also been observed in cypovirus TCPs (Furuichi, 1981) and in both mature and transcriptionally competent rotavirus particles (Lawton et al., 1999) .",

In rotavirus, the transcriptionally competent form of the virus has a double-layered capsid consisting of the structural proteins VP2 and VP6 surrounding the dsRNA genome segments and the enzymatic machinery in the core. Not only is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase unable to synthesize RNA efficiently unless associated with the inner capsid protein VP2 (Patton et al., 1997) , but the intermediate VP6 capsid layer must also be present (Bican et al., 1982; Kohli et al., 1993; Sandino et al., 1986) and the outermost VP7 capsid layer absent (Cohen et al., 1979; Chen and Ramig, 1993; Lawton et al., 1999) . These observations have led to the proposal that the functional endogenous transcription apparatus contains three components: (1) the enzymes required for RNA synthesis and capping, (2) a scaffold consisting of the intact VP2 capsid layer functionally enhanced by the presence of VP6 on the exterior surface, and (3) the viral nucleic acid . The identities of the proteins involved in the function of the transcription apparatus in several of the major prototype reoviruses are summarized in Table 4 .2. ",

            "text": "Because no cellular proteins are capable of transcribing or replicating a dsRNA template, all dsRNA viruses encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase as an essential component of the endogenous transcription apparatus. In rotavirus, several lines of evidence suggest that RNA synthesis is performed by VP1, a minor structural protein present in the viral core. The VP1 amino acid sequence contains the four major motifs commonly observed in RNA-dependent polymerases (Cohen et al., 1989; Poch et al., 1989; Bruenn, 1991; Suzuki et al., 1992) , and some temperature-sensitive mutations mapping to the gene encoding VP1 render the virus unable to polymerize RNA (Chen et al., 1990) . VP1 is specifically targeted by the nucleotide analog 8-azido-ATP (adenotn phosphate), which can ordinarily function as a substrate for RNA polymerization but becomes covalently cross-linked to VP1 upon ultraviolet irradiation, suggesting that VP1 is the protein that interacts with nucleotide substrates during RNA elongation (Valenzuela et al., 1991) . The polymerase activity of VP1 in rotavirus has also been inferred from the observation that protein complexes formed from the coexpression of VP1 and the inner capsid protein VP2 are capable of using single-stranded mRNA as a template to generate dsRNA Patton et al., 1997) . Although the polymerase activity of VP1 alone has yet to be demonstrated, the protein does bind specifically to the 3' end of viral transcripts in vitro and presumably in vivo, as would be expected of the viral polymerase (Patton, 1996) . Structural and biochemical studies indicate that there are likely 12 copies of VP1 per virion (Liu et al., 1988; Prasad et al., 1996) , probably existing as a heterodimeric complex with VP3, the other enzymatic component of the transcription apparatus . RNA polymerase activity has been directly demonstrated in the homologous proteins VP1 of bluetongue virus (Urukawa et al., 1989) , ~3 of mammalian orthoreovirus (Starnes and Joklik, 1993) , and the polymerase enzyme of cypovirus (Dai et al., 1982) .",

            "text": "The eukaryotic translation machinery requires the presence of a cap sequence at the 5' end of a mRNA transcript for efficient translation. For this reason, all dsRNA viruses infecting eukaryotic hosts contain the necessary enzymatic activities to synthesize a eukaryotic cap sequence on the end of each mRNA transcript before release. Rotavirus mRNA transcripts contain the cap sequence m7GpppGm at the 5' end (Imai et al., 1983; McCrae and McCorquodale, 1983) . To produce such a cap structure, four distinct enzyme activities are required to act on the penultimate pppG present in each transcript: (1) a nucleotide phosphohydrolase activity to remove the terminal orthophosphate to generate ppG; (2) a guanylytransferase activity to attach a guanine nucleotide to the 5' end to generate GpppG; (3) a methyltransferase activity to attach a methyl group to the N 7 position of the G cap to generate m7GpppG; and (4) a second methyltransferase activity to generate mTGpppG m (Furuichi et al., 1976) . The guanylyltransferase requires GTP (Pizarro et al., 1991a) , and the two methyltransferase reactions use the amino acid derivative S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the methyl donor (Spencer and Garcia, 1984) . In rotaviruses, the minor structural protein VP3, which is present in the viral core, possesses guanylyltransferase activity, suggesting that it is the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the second of these four steps in the capping reaction (Pizarro et al., 1991a; Liu et al., 1992; Patton and Chen, 1999) . As expected, VP3 preferentially binds to single-stranded, uncapped RNA as a preferred substrate . VP3 is likely incorporated into the viral core as a heterodimer with VP1 . Not surprisingly, the capping reactions also appear to be quite similar in orthoreoviruses (Furuichi et al., 1976) , orbiviruses (Mertens and Sanger, 1985) , and cypoviruses (Furuichi and Miura, 1975) .",

In the orbivirus bluetongue virus, the four enzymatic activities required for cap formation all reside within the core structural protein VP4, homologous to rotavirus VP3 (Martinez-Costas et al., 1998; . Furthermore, in orthoreovirus, the guanylyltransferase enzyme ~2 has been shown to contain a binding site for SAM (Koonin, 1993; Luongo et al., 1998) . This enzyme is also the target of the photoaffinity reagent 8-azido-S-adenosylmethionine (Seliger et al., 1987) , suggesting that both guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase activities needed for cap formation reside within a single protein in orthoreovirus as well. A nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase activity potentially involved in cap formation has also been described in cypovirus, but the enzyme responsible for this activity has not been identified (Shimotohno and Miura, 1977) . Whether the phosphohydrolase, guanylyltransferase, and methyltransferase enzyme activities all reside within a single protein in rotavirus remains to be determined. Nevertheless, it is likely that all of the cap formation activities are colocalized within the same protein in most, if not all, viruses in the family Reoviridae.",

While nucleotidyl transfer obviously requires a form of ATP which can be hydrolyzed to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) as directed by the template nucleotide sequence, elongation in rotavirus also has an absolute requirement for a form of ATP which can be hydrolyzed to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (Spencer and Garcia, 1984) . VP3, rather than the polymerase VP1, is believed to be the enzyme responsible for this (Pizarro et al., 1991b) . During the rotavirus life cycle, a helicase should be necessary only during transcription, as replication makes use of a single-stranded template to generate double-stranded RNA. As expected, the inhibition of ATPase activity in VP3 affects only transcription and has virtually no effect on the efficiency of reverse-strand synthesis during genome replication (Pizarro et al., 1991b) . A similar requirement for ATP hydrolysis during transcription but not replication has been observed in orthoreoviruses (Rankin et al., 1989) , although the protein responsible for this has not been directly identified.",

The inner capsid layer is formed from 60 dimers of quasiequivalent VP2 molecules organized on a T=I icosahedral lattice (Fig. 4.2 , see also color C d FIG 4.2. Role of VP2 as a scaffold for the internal components of the endogenous transcription apparatus. (a) When represented using a normal contour threshold (-0.4 a), the VP2 capsid layer appears as a thin, relatively featureless closed shell, and the volume accounts for the expected 120 molecules of VP2. The boundaries between individual VP2 monomers are difficult to distinguish. Several of the icosahedral symmetry axes are indicated. (b) When represented at an elevated contour threshold (N2.3 \u00a2~), the surface appears to separate into 60 antiparallel strips of mass density, with each strip extending from one icosahedral vertex (5-fold axis) to a point near an adjacent vertex. One of these strips is outlined. Each strip appears to have an approximate center of symmetry and, as such, may be a dimer of quasiequivalent VP2 molecules. These two types of VP2 are designated as A (red) and B (purple). (c) The transcription enzymes VP1 and VP3 form a complex that is anchored to the inner surface of the VP2 capsid layer. In this cross-sectional illustration produced from a three-dimensional reconstruction of 1/3/2/6-VLP and shown oriented along the icosahedral 3-fold axis, 9 of 12 complexes are shown, each anchored at an icosahedral vertex. (d) The VP1/3 complex appears as a flower-shaped structure (orange) attached to a small inward protrusion of VP2 at the 5-fold axis. (e) The inner surface of the VP2 capsid layer in the TCP serves as a scaffold for the enzymatic and nucleic acid components of the transcription apparatus. In this illustration, the capsid region surrounding the icosahedral vertex has been computationally isolated from the three-dimensional structure of the TCP to reveal the locations of three distinct classes of VP2-dsRNA contacts (numbered as 1, 2, and 3) and the anchor point for the VP1/3 enzyme complex (arrow).

This sort of inner capsid architecture is also seen in other segmented dsRNA viruses including the orbiviruses bluetongue (Grimes et al., 1998) and Broadhaven viruses (Schoehn et al., 1997) , orthoreovirus (Dryden et al., 1998) , the phytoreovirus rice dwarf virus (Lu et al., 1998) , aquareovirus (Shaw et al., 1996) , cypovirus (Hill et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 1999) , the fungal totiviruses L-A and P4 (Cheng et al., 1994; CastSn et al., 1997) , and cystovirus q~6 (Butcher et al., 1997) . This organization of protein subunits in the inner capsid layer appears to be a consistent trend among many segmented dsRNA viruses and indeed may be important in defining the architecture of the viral core.",

The rotavirus VP2 capsid layer, when viewed in a manner that allows the approximate boundaries between protein monomers to be distinguished, appears to have a similar overall architecture, with quasiequivalent VP2 monomers arranged in a nearly identical fashion within the capsid (Lawton et al., 1997b) .

From the three-dimensional structure, the interaction between these two molecules appears to be the strongest at the dimerization domain interface, where the two molecules interact in an endto-end arrangement, and comparatively weaker along the sides, suggesting that the naturally occurring assembly subunit may consist of a pair of VP2 molecules interacting end-to-end via the dimerization domain. Further evidence for this notion comes from electron microscopic examination of various forms of purified recombinant VP2 . At low protein concentrations, the recombinant VP2 protein self-assembles into empty icosahedral capsids closely resembling the VP2 capsid layer observed in the native virus. However, at high protein concentrations, the capsids undergo spontaneous conversion into long helical structures (see Zeng et al., 1994) . The width of these helical structures and the morphology of the subunits suggest that the helices likely consist of dimers of VP2 arranged in a braided configuration. Interestingly, at intermediate concentrations, helical structures can be seen extending away from clusters of partially disassembled particles, and the helical structures formed at high concentration are known to revert back to icosahedral capsids when the protein concentration is reduced. It is possible that the helical structure is favored when both VP2 molecules in the dimer exist in an identical conformation, whereas the icosahedral capsid is favored when the two molecules are constrained to adopt slightly different, quasiequivalent conformations.",

In rotavirus, the inner surface of VP2 forms numerous contacts with the dsRNA genome, especially within the vicinity of the icosahedral vertices (Lawton et al., 1997b) (Fig. 4.2e) . Whereas the transcription enzymes appear to interact with only one of the two types of quasiequivalent VP2 molecules, both types of VP2 appear to be involved in forming contacts with the genome. The RNA-binding region of VP2 has been localized to the amino terminus , although the affinity for dsRNA is considerably weaker than for ssRNA (Boyle and Holmes, 1986; Patton et al., 1997) . The large number of protein-nucleic acid contacts seen in the viral core are believed to serve two purposes. First, because of the stiffness of dsRNA, these interactions are likely necessary to induce the bending and folding required for proper genome packaging (Kapahnke et al., 1986) . Also, the extensive order imposed on the dsRNA genome through its numerous contacts with VP2 and the anchored VP1/VP3 complex may be critical for coordinating the efficient movement of the dsRNA template through the active site of the transcription enzyme complex . Extensive protein-dsRNA contacts are also seen in other segmented dsRNA viruses studied using structural techniques, including bluetongue virus (Gouet et al., 1999) , cypovirus (Zhang et al., 1999) , and cystovirus ~6 (Bamford et al., 1993) .",

Each genome segment is likely associated with its own polymerase enzyme in the viral core. This idea is a logical extension of the observation that the core of the virion contains 12 polymerase enzyme complexes and 11 genome segments and is also supported by the observation that no dsRNA virus containing more than 12 segments has ever been isolated . Kinetic studies of transcription in cypovirus clearly suggest that each genome segment is transcribed by an independently functioning transcription enzyme complex, as transcripts corresponding to all 10 segments are generated simultaneously, are synthesized at the same rate, and accumulate in molar quantities that are inversely proportional to their length (Smith and Furuichi, 1982) . Likewise, orthoreovirus TCPs also appear to be capable of simultaneous transcription of all 10 genome segments in molar quantities that are inversely proportional to segment length (Skehel and Joklik, 1969; Banerjee and Shatkin, 1970; Gillies et al., 1971; Bartlett et al., 1974) . The association of one transcription enzyme complex with one genome segment may arise initially during particle assembly and then remain throughout the lifetime of the virion. Viral mRNA is packaged and replicated to become dsRNA during particle assembly, and it is conceivable that the polymerase responsible for replicating and packaging a particular genome segment may also be the polymerase responsible for transcribing that same segment during a subsequent round of infection.",

            "text": "It is not known how the individual segments of dsRNA are organized within the particle, although several structural studies have provided helpful insights. In the three-dimensional structure of rotavirus at 19 A resolution, structurally discernible portions of the genome appear as concentric shells having decreasing order toward the center of the viral core (Fig. 4 .3a, see also color insert). In the outermost shell, which accounts for approximately 25% of the genome, individual helices of dsRNA are clearly visible as tubes of mass positioned along the inner surface of the VP2 capsid and encircling the transcription enzyme complexes (Fig. 4.3b) . Low angle X-ray scattering studies of mammalian orthoreovirus particles paint a similar picture, indicating that the dsRNA genome is tightly packed as parallel helices in a semicrystalline array (Harvey et al., 1981) . Regardless of the manner in which the nucleic acid is organized within the rotavirus core, the genome appears to fill nearly all of the space not occupied by protein, although biophysical studies of particles having rearranged genomes suggest that the viral interior is nonetheless able to accommodate up to 10% more dsRNA than is found in the standard rotavirus Internal organization of the rotavirus core. The enzymatic and nucleic acid components of the transcription apparatus are housed within the core of the virion. (a)A cross section of the viral core, produced from a three-dimensional reconstruction of the rotavirus TCP at 19 .\u00a3. resolution, illustrates how structurally discernible portions of the dsRNA genome appear as concentric shells (yellow and orange). These shells have the greatest degree of order near the inner surface of the viral capsid and progressively less order toward the viral center (maroon). (Inset) An averaged radial density profile, computed from the three-dimensional reconstruction of the TCP, further illustrates the concentric organization of the two capsid layers and the genomic dsRNA. The color scheme matches that used in the three-dimensional structures. The VP6 capsid layer extends between the radii 260 and 350 .h., VP2 between 230 and 260 A, and two shells of icosahedrally ordered dsRNA between ~160 and 230 .~. The structurally discernible portions of the VP1/3 transcription enzyme complexes are embedded within these two ordered dsRNA layers . (b) the VP6 (blue) and VP2 (green) capsid layers have been computationally removed, revealing the organization of the viral interior. A significant portion (approximately 25%) of the genomic dsRNA forms a well-organized layer (yellow) immediately inside the capsid. The surface of this RNA shell has been made slightly transparent to reveal the outlines of the RNA double helices, which have a higher density than protein. The dsRNA makes extensive contact with the inner surface of the VP2 capsid layer near the icosahedral vertices. (Inset) When displayed using a higher density threshold appropriate for nucleic acid, the dsRNA shell immediately inside the VP2 capsid layer is resolved into parallel tubes of mass, which likely represent dsRNA helices. Illustrations adapted from Prasad et al. (1996) . Figure 4 .4 illustrates the manner in which the genome segments organized in this way may be spatially distributed within the viral core. In this model, each genome segment occupies a defined region of the viral interior in the vicinity of the polymerase with which it is associated. The packaging of the linear genome segments within the viral core requires the nucleic acid to assume a collapsed configuration. Linear duplex DNA is known to collapse into a pear-shaped toroidal conformation under conditions of high ionic strength on the introduction of homonemic supercoils (Eickbush and Moudrianakis, 1978) , and it is conceivable that the same may be true of the linear dsRNA segments in rotavirus. Aligning the 11 collapsed genome segments with one another in a manner such that the pointed ends of the pear-shaped lobes are all oriented toward the center of the virus allows the entire genome to be packaged with maximal efficiently inside the icosahedral core, as suggested from theoretical modeling studies of DNA incorporation within the icosahedral head of the bacteriophage lambda (Witkiewicz and Schweiger, 1985) .",

            "text": "The precise manner in which the genome segments are organized to facilitate repeated cycles of transcription remains one of the more puzzling questions about the architecture of dsRNA viruses. The linear genome segments must be packaged in a manner that allows for reinitiation at the 3' end of the minus strand once the 5' end has been reached at the end of one transcription cycle. The mechanism of reini- The packaging of the rotavirus dsRNA genome within the icosahedral core may involve the collapse of the 11 segments into pear-shaped toroidal lobes packed with the pointed ends oriented toward the center (Witkiewicz and Schweiger, 1985) . Such a configuration could result from the introduction of homonemic supercoiling (Eickbush and Moudrianakis, 1978) . The 11 dsRNA genome segments may be organized such that each segment is associated with its own polymerase complex at one of the icosahedral vertices. tiation would be simple to envision if the ends of the linear genome segments were somehow tethered together throughout most of the transcription cycle, effectively \"circularizing\" the genome segment (Banerjee and Shatkin, 1970; Yazaki et al., 1986 ). On reaching the 5' end of the minus strand, the 3' end would then be positioned close to the polymerase active site for easy reinitiation. Although the genome segments are clearly not covalently linked into closed circular configurations, they could conceivably be tethered through limited nucleic acid base-pairing in cis or via a protein interacting simultaneously with both ends. The genomes of some dsDNA viruses are known to circularize via nucleic acid base-pairing, as occurs, for example, in the bacteriophage lambda (reviewed in Campbell, 1996) . Furthermore, the dsRNA replicative intermediate forms of several picornaviruses are known to be capable of forming circular molecules (Romanova and Agol, 1979; Robberson et al., 1982) . In all of these viral systems, circular forms of the genome arise through base pair formation involving single-stranded regions at one or both ends of the linear molecule. The genome segments of rotavirus, however, like those of other reoviruses, have blunt ends and limited sequence complementarity between opposite ends (Imai et al., 1983) , making it unlikely that the genome segments could circularize simply via the formation of nucleic acid base pairs between the ends of the molecules.",

Indeed, genome segments extracted from partially disrupted cypovirus TCPs under mild conditions take on a supercoiled appearance, implying that the ends of the linear segments are tethered securely enough within the core to maintain a certain amount of torsional strain in the double helix. The structural protein responsible for tethering the ends of the genome segments has not been positively identified; however, the transcription enzyme complex itself is a logical candidate, as such an arrangement would maintain the ends of the genome segments in close proximity to the polymerase active site throughout repeated transcription cycles. In cypovirus, tightly binding protein complexes can be copurified along with the genome segments under certain conditions, and these complexes possess RNA polymerase and methyltransferase activities, strongly suggesting that they are the enzymatic components of the endogenous transcription apparatus (Dai et al., 1982; Yazaki et al., 1986) .",

Topological strain arises as the nucleic acid template moves through the anchored transcription enzyme complex. As the helical axis is forced to rotate, the polymerase generates positive supercoils ahead of the transcription bubble and leaves negative supercoils in its wake (Liu and Wang, 1987) . If the template nucleic acid were to be in the form of a closed circle, the positive and negative supercoils would cancel each other, and the topological strain introduced during transcription would be only transient. In reoviruses, however, where the genome segments may be tethered to the transcription enzyme complex in an \"open circle\" configuration, the ends would presumably have to be bound in a manner that allows some freedom for them to rotate during transcript elongation to allow dissipation of topological strain. Atomic resolution structural studies of the transcription enzymes may shed light on the manner in which the ends of the genome segments are tethered within the viral core.",

In rotavirus, some nucleotide analogs are able to substitute for the NTPs (Pizarro et al., 1991b; Valenzuela et al., 1991) , but a form of ATP capable of being hydrolyzed to ADP must be included (Spencer and Garcia, 1984) , presumably for helicase function. SAM is not explicitly required for RNA synthesis in vitro, but its presence enhances the rate of transcription in rotavirus (Spencer and Garcia, 1984) , orbivirus (Van Dijk and Huismans, 1980) , and cypovirus (Furuichi, 1981; Mertens and Payne, 1983 ), although apparently not in orthoreovirus (Shatkin, 1974) . SAM may increase the rate of RNA synthesis by introducing a conformational change in the transcription enzyme complex, increasing the frequency of initiation (Wertheimer et al., 1980) . As is generally the case with polymerases, Mg 2\u00f7 is also required to facilitate nucleotide binding in the enzyme active site. When Mn 2\u00f7 is supplied instead of Mg 2\u00f7, the transcription enzymes retain some enzymatic activity (Cohen, 1977; Spencer and Arias, 1981; Skehel and Joklik, 1969; Yamakawa et al., 1982; Shimotohno and Miura, 1973; Van Dijk and Huismans, 1980) but lose the ability to discriminate properly between various NTPs (Gorziglia and Esparza, 1981; Pizarro et al., 1991a; Pelletier et al., 1996) .",

Biochemical studies investigating the relationship between temperature and the efficiency of mRNA production in calf rotavirus found that transcription is generally inhibited below 20\u00b0C or above 60\u00b0C and that mRNA production is most efficient around 50\u00b0C (Cohen, 1977) . A more comprehensive biochemical study conducted on mammalian orthoreovirus observed a similar phenomenon (Kapuler, 1970) . The production of mRNA in orthoreovirus TCPs could not be detected below ~30\u00b0C and, after reaching a maximum around 50\u00b0C, declined sharply above ~55\u00b0C. Furthermore, the effect of temperature on the efficiency of transcription was completely reversible. Particles preincubated at the optimum temperature and then shifted to a lower temperature were not able to transcribe any more efficiently than particles that had been maintained at the lower temperature throughout the duration of the experiment. This observation suggests that temperature does not induce a one-time \"transcriptional activation\" of some sort but rather represents an environmental factor continuously required for transcriptional efficiency. Temperature may thus be acting to hold the components of the endogenous transcription apparatus in a transcriptionally active conformation (Kapuler, 1970) .",

First, the effect of temperature on the efficiency of genome transcription in rotavirus appears to be completely reversible, as has been previously observed for mammalian orthoreovirus (Kapuler, 1970) . Second, changes in temperature appear to have an immediate and dramatic effect on the efficiency of the transcription process. This effect could be observed within the first minute after increasing or decreasing the temperature of the transcription reaction. Third, the rate of transcription at a particular temperature appears to be the same regardless of whether the virus had previously transcribed at a different temperature. A period of rapid transcription at 50\u00b0C did not somehow predispose the virus to be able to transcribe more efficiently than expected at 30\u00b0C. Likewise, a period of slow transcription at 30\u00b0C did not somehow cause the virus to transcribe less efficiently than expected at 50\u00b0C.",

Alternatively, improper pH may disrupt interactions that are important for the function of the endogenous transcription apparatus, perhaps preventing the polymerase from binding correctly to the dsRNA template or preventing the transcription precursors from binding to the active site of the polymerase.

Although few details are known about the way in which transcript initiation and elongation occur in rotavirus, biochemical studies in orthoreoviruses and cypoviruses have provided important insights that may have relevance for all members of the Reoviridae. In both of these viral systems, the progression from transcript initiation to sustained elongation seems to be the overall rate-limiting step during genome transcription. Under transcribing conditions, particles generate not only full-length transcripts but also an enormous molar excess of short oligonucleotides corresponding in sequence to the extreme 5' end of the plus strands (Bellamy et al., 1972; Zarbl, et al., 1980; Yamakawa et al., 1981; Furuichi, 1981) . Whereas some of these oligonucleotides are properly capped, others contain an incomplete cap structure, and most are uncapped. These oligonucleotides are believed to be aborted transcripts that arose when the transcription apparatus either failed to complete the initiation phase correctly or to progress properly into the elongation phase.",

First, the enzymatic and nucleic acid components of the endogenous transcription apparatus are held in their proper arrangement throughout repeated cycles of initiation and elongation. Additionally, by sequestering the dsRNA genome within the intact capsid, the virion is able to minimize the likelihood that the cellular interferon response system will become active, as viral dsRNA is a potent inducer of the interferon response and subsequent antiviral activities (reviewed in Samuel, 1998) .

Early observation of actively transcribing orthoreovirus particles suggested that all 10 genome segments can be transcribed simultaneously and that the transcripts are released through turret-like projections at the icosahedral vertices (Bartlett et al., 1974; Gillies et al., 1971) . Later biochemical studies conducted on actively transcribing cypoviruses confirmed that genome transcription involves the simultaneous synthesis of a complete set of mRNA transcripts from all of the dsRNA segments (Smith and Furuichi, 1982) , and observation of actively transcribing cypovirus particles suggested that, like orthoreoviruses, mRNA transcripts likely exit through turret-like projections at the icosahedral vertices (Yazaki and Miura, 1980) . Although these early studies of transcriptionally active particles provided valuable insights into the transcriptional behavior of segmented dsRNA viruses, several limitations precluded a more complete understanding of the mechanism of mRNA translocation through the intact capsid. First, nascent mRNA was visualized using the Kleinschmidt specimen preparation technique (Freifelder and Kleinschmidt, 1965) in conjunction with conventional electron microscopy. Such specimen preparation techniques, although useful for visualizing the overall morphology of biological macromolecules, may make a high-resolution analysis of the structure difficult, as the use of stains, fixatives, and desiccation during specimen preparation can introduce structural artifacts (Cohen et al., 1984) . In this way, the conditions under which specimens were prepared and images collected precluded a three-dimensional visualization of the pathway of mRNA translocation through the capsid. Second, although observa- Three-dimensional structures of the mature infectious rotavirus particle and the transcriptionally competent subviral particle. (Left) The mature rotavirus particle consists of three concentric capsid layers. In this illustration, produced from a threedimensional reconstruction of rotavirus at 24 ,\u00a3-resolution, the inner capsid protein VP2 is shown in green, the intermediate capsid protein VP6 in blue, and the outer capsid protein VP7 in yellow. The VP4 spike proteins are shown in orange. The transcription enzymes VP1 and VP3, along with the eleven genomic dsRNA segments, are housed in the interior within the VP2 capsid layer. (Center) Rotavirus enters the cell by penetration of the plasma membrane, and as a consequence of cell entry, the outer capsid proteins VP7 and VP4 are removed. (Right) Once inside the cell, the resulting subviral particle becomes transcriptionally active, releasing capped mRNA transcripts into the cytoplasm. [For text discussion, see pp. 189 in article by Lawton et al., this volume.] , the surface appears to separate into 60 antiparallel strips of mass density, with each strip extending from one icosahedral vertex (5-fold axis) to a point near an adjacent vertex. One of these strips is outlined. Each strip appears to have an approximate center of symmetry and, as such, may be a dimer of quasiequivalent VP2 molecules. These two types of VP2 are designated as A (red) and B (purple). (c) The transcription enzymes VP1 and VP3 form a complex that is anchored to the inner surface of the VP2 capsid layer. In this cross-sectional illustration produced from a three-dimensional reconstruction of 1/3/2/6-VLP and shown oriented along the icosahedral 3-fold axis, 9 of 12 complexes are shown, each anchored at an icosahedral vertex. (d) The VP1/3 complex appears as a flower-shaped structure (orange) attached to a small inward protrusion of VP2 at the 5-fold axis. (e) The inner surface of the VP2 capsid layer in the TCP serves as a scaffold for the enzymatic and nucleic acid components of the transcription apparatus. In this illustration, the capsid region surrounding the icosahedral vertex has been computationally isolated from the three-dimensional structure of the TCP to reveal the locations of three distinct classes of VP2-dsRNA contacts (numbered as 1, 2, and 3) and the anchor point for the VP1/3 enzyme complex (arrow).

[For text discussion, see pp. 199 in article by Lawton et al., this volume.] Internal organization of the rotavirus core. The enzymatic and nucleic acid components of the transcription apparatus are housed within the core of the virion. (a)A cross section of the viral core, produced from a three-dimensional reconstruction of the rotavirus TCP at 19 A resolution, illustrates how structurally discernible portions of the dsRNA genome appear as concentric shells (yellow and orange). These shells have the greatest degree of order near the inner surface of the viral capsid and progressively less order toward the viral center (maroon). (Inset) An averaged radial density profile, computed from the three-dimensional reconstruction of the TCP, further illustrates the concentric organization of the two capsid layers and the genomic dsRNA. The color scheme matches that used in the three-dimensional structures. The VP6 capsid layer extends between the radii 260 and 350 A, VP2 between 230 and 260/~, and two shells oficosahedrally ordered dsRNA between -160 and 230 ,~. The structurally discernible portions of the VP1/3 transcription enzyme complexes are embedded within these two ordered dsRNA layers . (b) the VP6 (blue) and VP2 (green) capsid layers have been computationally removed, revealing the organization of the viral interior. A significant portion (approximately 25%) of the genomic dsRNA forms a well-organized layer (yellow) immediately inside the capsid. The surface of this RNA shell has been made slightly transparent to reveal the outlines of the RNA double helices, which have a higher density than protein. The dsRNA makes extensive contact with the inner surface of the VP2 capsid layer near the icosahedral vertices. (Inset) When displayed using a higher density threshold appropriate for nucleic acid, the dsRNA shell immediately inside the VP2 capsid layer is resolved into parallel tubes of mass, which likely represent dsRNA helices.

The inner capsid protein VP3, structurally analogous to the VP2 protein of rotavirus, forms a shell having very few openings into the underlying viral core.

These studies found that the transcriptional capabilities of the TCP were profoundly affected by the attachment of protein to specific locations on the surface of the particle. For instance, in the mature rotavirus particle, which differs from the TCP by the presence of an additional capsid layer on the VP6 surface, transcript elongation was arrested after only 5-7 nt had been polymerized, and the aborted transcripts remained trapped within the viral interior. The VP2 and VP6 capsid layers in these two particle forms appeared to be similar in structure, although minor differences in the conformation of the trimers making up the VP6 capsid layer were observed within the vicinity of the VP2-VP6 capsid interface. Although the relationship between the subtle structural changes seen in the capsid and the inhibition of transcription in the core was not readily apparent in these studies owing to limitations in resolution, nearly identical structural and biochemical results were observed in a transcriptionally incompetent virus-Fab complex in which anti-VP6 Fabs were bound to the VP6 surface in a manner similar to that of VP7 in the mature particle. Higher resolution structural studies of transcriptionally incompetent particles will better characterize the mechanisms by which subtle conformational changes in the capsid architecture may prevent the proper function of the transcription apparatus in the viral interior.",

Mature orthoreovirions incubated with the precursors needed for RNA synthesis cannot produce full-length mRNA transcripts but are nevertheless observed to generate large quantities of short oligonucleotides corresponding in sequence to the 5' ends of the mature transcripts (Bellamy et al., 1972; Yamakawa et al., 1982) . Interestingly, although these oligonucleotides are generated in both mature virions and TCPs, the fact that they are generated in the complete absence of full-length transcripts in the mature particles demonstrates that the polymerase enzyme is fully capable of transcript initiation even in the presence of the outer capsid layer and suggests that the inhibition of genome transcription in the mature particle occurs at the stage of transcript elongation and/or translocation through the capsid (Yamakawa et al., 1982) . In support of these observations, comparative structural studies of mature and transcriptionally competent orthoreovirus particles have provided evidence of significant conformational changes occurring in the inner capsid regions near the icosahedral vertices on removal of the outer capsid proteins (Dryden et al., 1993) . It is quite likely that these conformational changes are involved in transforming the capsid to a state that facilitates, rather than hinders, the translocation of mRNA during transcription.",

If mRNA translocation through the capsid is somehow disrupted, transcript elongation at the enzyme active site in the core is probably affected immediately, as the failure to translocate nascent mRNA away from the site of synthesis would likely hinder the movement of the dsRNA template through the polymerase, given the dense packing of the genome observed in the core of the virion (Harvey et al., 1981; Prasad et al., 1996; Zhang et al., 1999) . During genome transcription in segmented dsRNA viruses, the processes of transcript elongation in the core and translocation through the capsid need to be coordinated, and with the disruption of mRNA elongation comes premature termination of transcription, as has been described for some DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (Spencer and Groudine, 1990) .",

Viruses with dsRNA genomes face a particular challenge in that host cells do not produce proteins which can transcribe from a dsRNA template. Therefore, dsRNA viruses contain all of the necessary enzymatic machinery to synthesize complete mRNA transcripts within the core without the need for disassembly. Indeed one of the more striking observations about genome transcription in dsRNA viruses is that this process occurs efficiently only when the transcriptionally competent particle is fully intact. This observation suggests that all of the components of the TCP, including the viral genome, the transcription enzymes, and the viral capsid, function together to produce and release mRNA transcripts and that each component has a specific and critical role to play in promoting the efficiency of this process.",

However, despite numerous architectural and organizational differences among the families of dsRNA viruses, numerous studies suggest that the basic mechanism of mRNA production may be similar in most, if not all, viruses having dsRNA genomes. Important functional similarities include (1) the presence of a capsid-bound RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which produces single-stranded mRNA transcripts from the dsRNA genome and regenerates the dsRNA genome from single-stranded RNA templates; (2) in viruses infecting eukaryotic hosts, the presence of all the enzymatic activities needed to generate the 5' cap required by the eukaryotic translation machinery; (3) the high degree of structural order present in the packaged genome, suggesting the requirement for organization in the viral core; (4) the role of the innermost capsid protein as a scaffold on which the core components of the transcription apparatus are assembled; and (5) the release of nascent mRNA transcripts through channels at the icosahedral vertices.",

Future studies will dissect important intermolecular interactions required for efficient mRNA synthesis and will shed further light on the reasons for which the viral core must be structurally intact in order for transcription to occur efficiently. Structural studies of the capping enzymes at atomic resolution will reveal how multiple enzyme activities reside within a single polypeptide and how they act in concert to synthesize the 5\" cap on the end of each mature transcript. Perhaps most interestingly, high resolution structural studies of actively transcribing virions will provide insight into the conformational changes that occur within the core during mRNA synthesis. Together, these studies will clarify the function of this complex macromolecular machine and will also shed additional light on the basic principles of virus architecture and assembly, as well as provide avenues for the design of antiviral therapies.",

(a)A cross section of the viral core, produced from a three-dimensional reconstruction of the rotavirus TCP at 19 .\u00a3. resolution, illustrates how structurally discernible portions of the dsRNA genome appear as concentric shells (yellow and orange). These shells have the greatest degree of order near the inner surface of the viral capsid and progressively less order toward the viral center (maroon). (Inset) An averaged radial density profile, computed from the three-dimensional reconstruction of the TCP, further illustrates the concentric organization of the two capsid layers and the genomic dsRNA. The color scheme matches that used in the three-dimensional structures. The VP6 capsid layer extends between the radii 260 and 350 .h., VP2 between 230 and 260 A, and two shells of icosahedrally ordered dsRNA between ~160 and 230 .~. The structurally discernible portions of the VP1/3 transcription enzyme complexes are embedded within these two ordered dsRNA layers (Prasad et al., 1996). (b) the VP6 (blue) and VP2 (green) capsid layers have been computationally removed, revealing the organization of the viral interior. A significant portion (approximately 25%) of the genomic dsRNA forms a well-organized layer (yellow) immediately inside the capsid. The surface of this RNA shell has been made slightly transparent to reveal the outlines of the RNA double helices, which have a higher density than protein. The dsRNA makes extensive contact with the inner surface of the VP2 capsid layer near the icosahedral vertices. (Inset) When displayed using a higher density threshold appropriate for nucleic acid, the dsRNA shell immediately inside the VP2 capsid layer is resolved into parallel tubes of mass, which likely represent dsRNA helices.

(a) When represented using a normal contour threshold (-0.4 (~), the VP2 capsid layer appears as a thin, relatively featureless closed shell, and the volume accounts for the expected 120 molecules of VP2. The boundaries between individual VP2 monomers are difficult to distinguish. Several of the icosahedral symmetry axes are indicated. (b) When represented at an elevated contour threshold (~2.3 ~)",

The cd loop (putative fusion peptide) is shown in green and the six disulfide bridges in orange. The black spheres on the lower ribbon in B show the positions of mutations affecting fusion characteristics. The gray spheres on the upper ribbon show the positions of mutations defining epitopes of TBE virus MAbs that inhibit fusion (67 and 71: MAb A3; 233: MAb A4). Mutations affecting fusion are discussed in section VII H and inhibition of fusion by MAbs in section VII I. CHO: First residue of the carbohydrate attached to Asn 154.
