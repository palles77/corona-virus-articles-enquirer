            "text": "Phenolic compounds, metabolites of the phenylpropanoid pathway, play an important role in the growth and environmental adaptation of many plants. Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is the first key enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway. The present study was designed to investigate whether there is a multi-gene family in I. Indigotic and, if so, to characterize their properties. We conducted a comprehensive survey on the transcription profiling database by using tBLASTn analysis. Several bioinformatics methods were employed to perform the prediction of composition and physicochemical characters. The expression levels of IiPAL genes in various tissues of I. indigotica with stress treatment were examined by quantitative real-time PCR. Protoplast transient transformation was used to observe the locations of IiPALs. IiPALs were functionally characterized by expression with pET-32a vector in Escherichia colis strain BL21 (DE3). Integration of transcripts and metabolite accumulations was used to reveal the relation between IiPALs and target compounds. An new gene (IiPAL2) was identified and both IiPALs had the conserved enzymatic active site Ala-Ser-Gly and were classified as members of dicotyledon. IiPAL1 and IiPAL2 were expressed in roots, stems, leaves, and flowers, with the highest expression levels of IiPAL1 and IiPAL2 being observed in stems and roots, respectively. The two genes responded to the exogenous elicitor in different manners. Subcellular localization experiment showed that both IiPALs were localized in the cytosol. The recombinant proteins were shown to catalyze the conversion of L-Phe to trans-cinnamic acid. Correlation analysis indicated that IiPAL1 was more close to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites than IiPAL2. In conclusion, the present study provides a basis for the elucidation of the role of IiPALs genes in the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds, which will help further metabolic engineering to improve the accumulation of bioactive components in I. indigotica.",

            "text": "As one of guaiacy lignins, lariciresinol is derived from phenylpropanoid pathway with many enzymes involved [10] (Fig. 1) . As the first key enzyme in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, PAL links primary and secondary metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of L-phenylalanine to cinnamic acid and is also a rate-limiting step of the phenylpropanoid metabolism [11] . Since the first PAL was discovered from barley by Koukol and Conn in 1961 [12] , more and more PAL genes have been cloned in many higher plants, such as Salvia Miltiorrhiza [13] , Dendrobium [14] , Salix viminalis [14] , and Picrorhiza kurrooa [16] , and it also have been found in some liverworts [17] and fungi [18] . In a number of plants, the PAL proteins are encoded by a multi-gene family. The number of PAL genes is three in S. Miltiorrhiza [19] and Coffea canephora [20] , four in S. viminalis [15] , five in Populus trichocarpa [21] , six in Oryza sativa [22] , and twelve in Citrullus lanatus [23] . The individual PAL may respond differentially to biotic or abiotic stress, and its different expressions in tissues may be involved in the production of different products under specific conditions. In C. canephora [20] , CcPAL2 transcripts appear predominantly in flower, fruit pericarp, roots, and branches, whereas CcPAL1 and CcPAL3 are highly expressed in immature fruits. What's more, CcPAL1 and CcPAL3 are associated with the accumulation of cholorogenic acids (CGA), whereas CcPAL2 may contribute more significantly to flavonoid accumulation. In S. Miltiorrhiza [19] , all three SmPALs are regulated by drought and MeJA treatments, although the time and degree of reactions differ one from another.",

IiPAL1 is constitutively expressed in roots, stems, and leaves, with the highest expression being found in stems, and it responds to gibberellin (GA3), abscisic acid (ABA), methyl jasmonate (MeJA), and cold treatments. However, the characteristics of IiPAL1 need to be further investigated and a systematic analysis of different PAL genes in I. indigotica also is needed.

It was in good agreement with that predicted by the bioinformatics method. Enzyme assays were carried out under standard conditions, using purified protein and L-Phe as the substrate. The control reaction with L-Phe using the same buffer without the PAL enzyme gave a peak of L-Phe (Fig. 7A) . After L-Phe catalyzed by recombinant proteins ht-IiPAL1 and ht-IiPAL2, respectively, only one peak at about 23 min could be seen, which should be ascribed to the L-Phe conversion to trans-cinnamic acid (Figs. 7C\u22127D) .

The RiPAL1 in Rubus idaeus is associated with early fruit ripening events, whereas expression of RiPAL2 is correlated more with later stages of flower and fruit development [38] . In C. lanatus, only six of the 12 ClPALs may have the potential roles of developing fruit color and flavor [23] . Consistently, differential expression patterns were observed from the two IiPALs, although they were expressed in all of the tissues analyzed. IiPAL1 was found to be highly expressed in the stems, while IiPAL2 predominately showed expressions in the roots. The root of I. indigotica is the well-known Chinese medicine \"Banlangen\" (Radix Isatidis), and the distribution of IiPALs in the tissues suggests that IiPAL2 may play possible roles in roots through lignin formation and participate in the developmental processes of I. indigotica. However, the role of IiPAL1 cannot be denied, because some genes may mediate active pharmaceutical compounds biosynthesis in aerial organs [39] . Expression analyses demonstrated that PAL could be widely stimulated by environmental elicitors such as low temperature, dehydration, and UV irradiation [40] . Plant signaling molecules, including ABA, salicylic acid (SA), and JA [41] , have also been demonstrated to elicit PAL activity. In general, all the elicitors chosen in the present study could escalate the IiPALs expression, but the up-regulations may be caused by different mechanisms.",

However, differences were observed for two IiPALs in the time and degree of responses after treated with MeJA. Similar results were previously found in three PALs from Salvia Miltiorrhiza. These differences in response to MeJA might be explained by the complexity and diversity of MeJA. On the other hand, the expressions of IiPAL1 and IiPAL2 were similar after irradiation with UV-B. They showed the highest induction at the same time under UV-B induction and the increase didn't disappear after the removal of UV-B, as seen with P. Kurrooa. Many elicitors could modulate the production of many important secondary metabolites of the phenylpropanoid pathway, such as bisbibenzyl in Plagiochasma appendiculatum [17] , lignins and anthocyanins in A. thaliana [42] , and phenolics and flavonoids in Hypericum perforatum [43] . So it may be used as a new strategy to improve the content of phenylpropanoid compounds. Fig. 9 Correlation network for the metabolites (right) and IiPALs (left) with a cut-off |r| > 0.6. The canonical correlation coefficient between two canonical correlation variables (U and V) was 1.00.

At subcellular level, PAL was mainly located in cytoplasm and chloroplast, mitochondria, glyoxysome, peroxisoame, and other membrane organelles [44] . Jin Nakashima has proven that PAL activity in the cytosolic is the best [45] .
