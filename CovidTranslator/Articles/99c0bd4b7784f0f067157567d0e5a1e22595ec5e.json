Statistical analysis showed that infection rates were significantly higher in lambs of \\1 month age group (65 %) than other two age groups (p \\ 0.05). Similarly, cryptosporidial infection rates were significantly higher in diarrhoeic (54.41 %) than in non diarrhoeic lambs (34.61 %). Winter records highest prevalence (73.33 %) which varied significantly. Sex wise higher prevalence was observed in females (51.56 %) as compared to males (39.28 %).

Mortality is low in naturally reared suckling lambs, although it increases when the disease is associated with concurrent infections or deficiencies in nutrition or husbandry (de Graaf et al. 1999) . Cryptosporidial infection in small ruminants was first diagnosed in 1987, in diarrhoeic lambs (Rojo-V\u00e1zquez et al. 1987) . Later, infection was reported in sheep from different geographical areas of the world as reviewed by Thompson et al. (2005) . In India, most data on the incidence of Cryptosporidium infection in animals are mostly related to calves (Singh et al. 2006; Paul et al. 2008; Yadav et al. 2012 ) and till date no report has been published regarding status of the infection in lambs.",

Faecal samples were examined by preparing smears on the glass slides and then were stained by the modified Ziehl Neelsen technique (Henricksen and Pohlenz 1981) . Data regarding consistency of faeces, age and sex of the animal were also recorded. The entire surface of the smear was examined for the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts at 4009 and 1,0009 magnifications and, if positive, infection intensity was evaluated as per OIE (2008) i.e., 1? ; less than 5 oocysts per slide, 2? ; 1-10 oocysts per field of view and 3? ; 11 or more oocysts per field of view.",

This finding is probably the first documented report regarding the prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection in lambs in India. The high prevalence of lambs shedding oocysts in the first month stresses on the fact that most of them might be infected immediately after birth. This observation is consistent with the duration of the parasite's life cycle which is around 4 days and suggestive of heavy environmental contamination in the lambing area and/or infection from post parturient dams which remain permanently with lambs and responsible for infection at suckling (Causape et al. 2002) .",

Nevertheless, Munoz-fernandez et al. (1996) had earlier reported that Cryptosporidium was the most frequent agent found in 45 % of diarrhoeic lambs in contrast to potentially pathogenic E. coli (30 %) and Rota virus (2.1 %). The association of diarrhoea with prevalence of cryptosporidiosis showed positive correlation as higher prevalence was observed in diarrhoeic lambs (54.41 %) in comparison to non diarrhoeic lambs (34.61 %). The constant association of diarrhoea and the presence of oocysts of Cryptosporidium in the faeces have been recorded by other workers (Causape et al. 2002) . In Serbia, diarrhoea was observed more frequently in younger lambs positive for Cryptosporidium (69 %) than older lambs where infection was frequently asymptomatic (70.8 %) (Zorana et al. 2006) . As many as 93.3 % of lambs in the first week infected by Cryptosporidium had diarrhoea and this was found to be statistically associated with cryptosporidial infection in all age groups even in lambs of 22-90 days of age (Causape et al. 2002) .",

This is because lambing generally occurs in winter season (late November and December months), therefore, higher number of lambs were in the risk age group i.e., 1-3 weeks of age (Santin et al. 2007 ). In winter, the temperature in study area is suitable for viability and survival of Cryptosporidium oocysts. The present findings are also supported by observation of Fayer et al. (2000) and Jenkins et al. (2003) who observed that Cryptosporidium oocysts can remain viable and infective for 4-5 months at 5-20\u00b0C. The studies on seasonality in the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis in lambs are limited.",
