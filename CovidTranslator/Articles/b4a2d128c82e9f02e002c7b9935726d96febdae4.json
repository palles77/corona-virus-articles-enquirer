            "text": "A descriptive study of acute bronchitis in patients without pre-existing pulmonary disease was undertaken in the community during the winter months of 1986-87. Forty-two episodes were investigated in 40 individuals. The cardinal symptom was the acute onset ofcough (100%), usually productive (90%). Wheezing was noted by 62% of patients, but heard on auscultation in only 31%. A potential pathogen was isolated in 29% of cases with a virus (eight cases) being identified more frequently than either Mycoplasma pneumoniae (three cases) or a bacterium (three cases). The acute illness was associated with significant reductions in forced expired volume in I second (P < 0.02) and peak expiratory flow (P < 0.001) but not forced vital capacity compared to 6 weeks later. Ten of the 27 (37%) patients who had a histamine challenge test performed at 6 weeks had a PD20 of < 7.8/zmol histamine. Thirty-nine episodes (93%) were treated with antibiotics by the general practitioner, the clinical course being unremarkable apart from one patient who developed a lingular pneumonia despite antibiotic therapy. Further studies are required to assess whether acute bronchitis causes an acute increase in bronchial hyperresponsiveness and whether either antibiotics or inhaled bronchodilators or anti-inflammatory therapy has a useful role in the management of this predominantly viral illness. 0954-611 I/90/050377 + 09 $03.00/0 9 1990 Bailli~re Tindall",

            "text": "Acute bronchitis is a condition diagnosed commonly in general practice, particularly in the winter months, reaching rates of approximately 150 cases per 100 000 population per week (1) . It is presumed that most episodes of acute bronchitis are viral in origin, although previous work, with one exception (2) has studied children (3) (4) (5) or patients with underlying pulmonary disease (6) (7) (8) and has shown only modest rates of virus identification and very low rates of bacterial isolation. There is also the diagnostic problem ofidentifying whether an individual patient has simple acute bronchitis: in many patients, particularly children, the diagnosis of asthma is missed (9) . It is believed that the acute effect of such an illness on pulmonary function is minimal and does not contribute to the development of chronic airflow obstruction (10) . However, upper respiratory tract infections may produce changes in pulmonary function as indicated by a reduction in gas transfer (11) , increase in closing volumes in smokers (12) , and a fall in dynamic compliance (13) . In addition, uncomplicated influenza has been shown to produce a transient fall in forced expired volume in 1 second and arterial oxygen concentration (14) , The Received 24 November 1989 and accepted 11 May 1990. effect of viral infections on bronchial hyperreactivity is uncertain (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) and epidemiological studies in the community give conflicting results with respect to respiratory tract infections and bronchial hyperreactivity (20,2 I) . In view of the continuing apparent difficulty in separating acute bronchitis from asthma, this descriptive study was undertaken to examine the clinical, microbiological and pulmonary function aspects of the illness being diagnosed as acute bronchitis in patients with no pre-existing pulmonary disease.",

(See Fig. 1 for a full listing of symptoms and signs.) Wheezing was noted by 62% of patients, coryza by 71% and sore throat by 57%. A variety of less specific symptoms were also reported, notably sweating (60%) and headache (50%). Symptoms were reported with equal frequency by males and females. Clinical signs were recorded by the GP in 18 cases (43%), wheeze being noted in 13 (31%) and crackles in ten (24%). Delay in presentation to the GP after the onset of symptoms varied from 2-35 days [median 7 days; mean (SD) 10 (9) days] ( Figure  2 ).

Hospital inpatient enquiry data suggests that less than 0.25% of cases of acute bronchitis are admitted to hospital. Thus, acute bronchitis is a common illness managed largely by general practitioners. The weekly returns data on acute bronchitis from the Research Unit of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RURCGP) demonstrate a consistent pattern with the highest attack rises being seen in winter months ( 1 ), in the very young and in the elderly. This age pattern differs fr6m that observed it] the present study because we excluded cases of acute hronchiolitis and exacerbations of chronic airflow obstruction (both of which are included in the RURCGP figures) and asthma, a condition often missed and mislabelled 'acute bronchitis' in general practice. In addition, we probably lost cases by allowing the option of other diagnoses such as chest infection. The advantage of this study, however, is that patients were investigated in whom the GP had made a diagnosis of what s/he regarded as acute bronchitis. It is possible, but unlikely, that some patients may have had pneumonia on presentation, since previous work of lower respiratory tract infection in the community (excluding clinical pneumonia) showed new X-ray changes in only 2.3% of patients (30) .",

Three factors contributed to this finding. Firstly, where patients were able to determine the duration ofsymptoms, 62% stated that symptoms had been present for 6 or more days. Since viral shedding declines quickly after the onset of infection, delay in investigation, such as was seen in our study, may be a major reason for failing to identify a viral pathogen. This is further supported by the lack of detectable alFN in all but one of our patients, alFN being present only transiently after the initial infection (24) . Secondly, serological investigation was performed for a limited number of respiratory viruses, the major omissions being coronaviruses, which usually produce a coryzal illness (34) and parainfluenza viruses for which serology is unreliable. Thirdly, it has been suggested that sputum might be a better source for viral culture than NPW or throat swabs (4) . In our study, only 31% were able to produce asputum specimen at the time of consultation, despite having a history of productive cough. NPW was well Finally, there is the possibility that some of these attacks may not have been due to any infective agent, but instead might have been misdiagnosed asthma precipitated by, for example, changes in temperature or acute bronchitis attacks associated with other environmental factors.",

In the past, patients with upper respiratory tract infection have had HCTs performed safely on presentation (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) , and since we found only minor changes in pulmonary function, we feel that HCT could be performed on presentation in future studies. Ideally, premorbid HCTs would be needed to assess viral induced changes in BHR, but this would be logistically a major task, but HCTs on presentation may point to an initial even higher degree of reactivity. A positive HCT was observed in 41% of patients, despite having excluded patients with known asthma or chronic airflow obstruction. The prewtlence of BHR in this group, therefore, is higher than that observed in epidemiological studies in this country (20) . A proportion &these cases may be 'missed' asthma, but the degree of bronchial hyperreactivity was slight, with only one individual in the range regarded as \"moderate' hyperreactivity by Woolcock and colleagues (26) . The bronchial hyperreactivity may be transient due to the recent infection (15) , but because we did not perform HCT on presentation, it is not possible to examine this point more closely. Alternatively, the patients with bronchial hyperreactivity may be more liable than normal individuals to develop lower respiratory tract involvement with a viral respiratory tract infection and may be individuals with the 'bronchial irritability syndrome' identified by Mortagy et al. (36) . Epidemiological studies would only identify such patients ifquestions wereasked about lower respiratory tract infections/symptoms.",
