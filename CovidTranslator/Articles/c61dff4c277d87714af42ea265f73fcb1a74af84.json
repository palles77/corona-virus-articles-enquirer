We wished to determine prospectively the incidence of viral infection in exacerbated and stable COPD patients as well as smokers who do not have airways obstruction. Methods: Stable and exacerbated COPD patients were recruited along with a group of patients who had smoked but who did not have any airways obstruction. Spirometry was performed and sputum specimens were tested for a range of 12 different respiratory viruses using PCR. Results: One hundred and thirty-six patients with exacerbations of COPD, 68 stable COPD patients and 16 non-obstructed smokers were recruited. A respiratory virus was detected in 37% of exacerbations, 12% of stable COPD patients and 12% of non-obstructed smokers, p < 0.0005. Rhinovirus was most frequently detected. The symptom of fever was associated with virus detection, p < 0.05. Infection with more than one virus was only found in the exacerbated COPD patients. Conclusion: Respiratory viral infection is associated with exacerbations of COPD. Rhinovirus was the most common infecting agent identified and in two cases human metapneumovirus was also detected. Dual infections were only seen amongst those patients admitted to hospital with acute exacerbations of COPD. Viruses were more commonly detected in those with more severe airways disease. \u00aa a v a i l a b l e a t w w w . s c i e n c e d i r e c t . c o m j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / r m e d Respiratory Medicine (2008) 102, 1575e1580",

Studies using serology and viral culture identified respiratory viruses in 30% of patients during acute exacerbations of COPD. 4 With the development of more sensitive molecular tests the role of viruses in COPD has been better defined. Walsh et al. identified several common respiratory viruses in a cohort of patients with COPD or congestive cardiac failure. 5 Viruses were identified by serology and viral culture methods. Significant outcomes in terms of hospitalisation were seen for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A infected patients. Greenberg et al., using serology and viral culture, showed that in 23% of cases of hospitalisation of COPD patients a virus was detected and that the mean time to return to symptomatic baseline was 2 weeks. 6 The most common viruses identified were of the picornavirus classification (rhinoviruses).",

Initially, in 2000 Seemungal et al. examined 33 patients with COPD when stable and subsequently during an exacerbation. 7 Ten of 43 exacerbations were associated with rhinovirus infection. Higher symptom scores and sputum interleukin-6 levels were seen with rhinovirus exacerbations. Seemungal et al. went on to show respiratory viral infection in 39% of exacerbations of COPD. 8 Viral infection was associated with a more severe exacerbation, and in patients who had a higher frequency of exacerbations, i.e. those with the poorest lung function. Patients were reviewed in convalescence at 4e6 weeks. The majority (58%) of these viruses were rhinovirus (i.e. 23% of COPD exacerbations). Plasma IL-6 levels were elevated in all exacerbations, and levels were significantly increased in the virus positive group when comparison was made with those in whom no virus was detected.",

The most recent study from Beckham et al. combined specimens obtained for two previous studies for analysis by PCR. 10 They detected a respiratory viral infection in 42% of acute respiratory illnesses. Respiratory viral infection in COPD patients during exacerbation has been associated with longer median symptom recovery time in comparison to exacerbations in which a viral agent was not identified (13 days versus 6 days respectively). 8 The hypothesis tested in the present study was that acute respiratory viral infection is implicated in the pathogenesis of COPD exacerbations. The aims of the present study were to examine respiratory specimens for the presence of respiratory viruses in patients with COPD whilst stable and also during exacerbations.",

All samples were processed within 2 h. Specimens were mixed with 4 volumes of 0.1% dithiothreitol (Sigma, Poole, UK) and shaken in an orbital incubator (Gallenkamp, Loughborough, UK) for 15 min at 37 C followed by the addition of 4 volumes of phosphate buffered saline and shaken for a further 5 min. The resulting suspension was then filtered through 50 mm Nylon Gauze (Lockertex, Warrington, UK) and spun down at 1000 \u00c2 g for 10 min.

The detection rate of respiratory viruses during exacerbations of COPD in this study (37%) is comparable to results obtained by Seemungal 9 Lower detection rates may be related to time of sampling as patients presenting to hospital had developed symptoms for a median of 5 days prior to admission. This is the first study to prospectively analyse this range of respiratory viruses in patients recruited during exacerbation of COPD. The most common infecting agent was rhinovirus in keeping with previous studies, 8e10 however we also detected a high rate of adenoviral infection which has not previously been reported. This is in keeping with the findings of Coyle et al. who demonstrated that adenovirus is more commonly detected using PCR than conventional immunofluorescence and virus culture techniques. 14 Previous investigators have related adenoviral infection to subsequent latent infection in the form of adenovirus E1A and that it may be important in the pathogenesis of COPD. 15 Metapneumovirus was discovered in 2001 and initially detected in young children with a respiratory tract illness. 16 It was subsequently found to play a role in communityacquired respiratory tract illness with 2.2% of patients presenting with 'influenza-like illness' testing positive. 17 Beckham et al. tested specimens from patients during exacerbations of COPD and when stable for metapneumovirus but all patients were negative. 10 Rohde et al. found metapneumovirus to be present in 2.3% of patients during acute exacerbations of COPD and none of the stable COPD patients in keeping with the findings of this study. 18 The detection of human metapneumovirus in this study confirms its role as a respiratory pathogen in adult patients with COPD.",

In some cases there may be several days between infection, development of symptoms and presentation. Depending on the duration of viral infection prior to seeking medical help there may be some cases in which patients present late and thus viral replication is decreasing, resulting in a reduced detection rate. This may lead to an underestimation of the prevalence of viral infection in these patients. Recent publications also suggest that RSV detection is increased with the use of real-time PCR assays. 8 All respiratory viral assays in this study utilized nested PCR technology and not real-time PCR methods. Detection of respiratory viruses by PCR may in fact relate to airway colonization 20 or viral persistence. 21 However, several of the patients were seen at different time points during this study and the same virus was not detected by repeat sampling suggesting that those testing positive using the PCR screen were experiencing an acute viral infection.",

These episodes may be related to the progressive nature of this disease process rather than an acute event. Thus the true role of respiratory viral infection in exacerbations may be underestimated. A possible area of bias was that all patients recruited were hospitalized. Thus selection bias may have been imposed in that those patients admitted to hospital tended to have particular types of respiratory viral infection or that respiratory viral infection only precipitated an exacerbation and subsequent hospital admission in patients with severe COPD. Another potential source of bias is the seasonality of respiratory viral infection. We addressed this issue by recruiting patients during all months of the year over a 2-year period. Other potential sources of bias include patient selection; those patients most ill and requiring non-invasive ventilation were too ill to participate in the study. Thompson et al. have published data linking influenza and RSV infection with increased mortality in the elderly. 22 There are increased admissions in older people in winter. Fleming showed that acute respiratory infections are associated with hospitalisation and increased mortality. 23 It reinforces the health service implications of winter infection and increased exacerbations of COPD. It is also noteworthy that the peak death rate is in patients diagnosed with acute respiratory disease. 23 Influenza has been linked with increased health care use by the elderly and there is an excess mortality particularly in the elderly. 24 This paper highlights the impact of respiratory viral infection on health care resources. It supports the use of influenza vaccination in patients with underlying respiratory disease in order to reduce exacerbations and hospital admissions.",
