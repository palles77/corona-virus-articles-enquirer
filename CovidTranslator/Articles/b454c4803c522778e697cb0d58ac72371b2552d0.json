This analysis reviews national eff orts to achieve UHC. With a broad range of health indicators, life expectancy (ranging from 53 years to 73 years), and mortality rate in children younger than 5 years (ranging from 10\u00b73 to 44\u00b76 deaths per 1000 livebirths), a review of progress in each of the BRICS countries shows that each has some way to go before achieving UHC. The BRICS countries show substantial, and often similar, challenges in moving towards UHC. On the basis of a review of each country, the most pressing problems are: raising insuffi cient public spending; stewarding mixed private and public health systems; ensuring equity; meeting the demands for more human resources; managing changing demographics and disease burdens; and addressing the social determinants of health. Increases in public funding can be used to show how BRICS health ministries could accelerate progress to achieve UHC. Although all the BRICS countries have devoted increased resources to health, the biggest increase has been in China, which was probably facilitated by China's rapid economic growth. However, the BRICS country with the second highest economic growth, India, has had the least improvement in public funding for health. Future research to understand such diff erent levels of prioritisation of the health sector in these countries could be useful. Similarly, the role of strategic purchasing in working with powerful private sectors, the eff ect of federal structures, and the implications of investment in primary health care as a foundation for UHC could be explored. These issues could serve as the basis on which BRICS countries focus their eff orts to share ideas and strategies.",

At the World Health Assembly in May, 2012, the BRICS countries \"stressed the importance of universal health coverage (UHC) as an essential instrument for the achievement of the right to health [and] welcomed the growing global support for UHC and sustainable development\". 2 But how do the BRICS countries measure up to national commitments to achieve UHC? Building on recent national studies of UHC eff orts 3,4 (as well as country series published in The Lancet for Brazil, India, China, and South Africa), in this paper we review, assess, and compare UHC eff orts in each of the BRICS countries. Because there is not yet a standard, internationally agreed quantitative framework to measure progress towards UHC, in this analysis we review national data and present a qualitative analysis of eff orts to reach UHC in each of the BRICS countries. 5 Defi ned as access to needed health services and fi nancial risk protection, 6 UHC is a shared health policy goal for all the BRICS countries, and is increasingly regarded as an overarching goal for health in the post-2015 development agenda. 7 Although there are notable diff erences within and across these countries in terms of wealth, health indicators, and systems (table 1), in this paper we use a simple framework to assess health systems and reforms towards UHC (as defi ned in the 2010 World Health Report), and consider these eff orts and remaining challenges.",

Although coverage is uneven and highest in wealthier areas, it covers an estimated 25% of the population (48 million people). Copayment is not a widespread practice, but it is increasing. In 2008, private per-head health-related expenditures were triple that of public per-head expenditure. 16 In view of the fact that people covered by private health plans are healthier, richer, and younger than are those not covered, substantial inequalities exist between private and public systems. In 2010, the Brazilian private health market was estimated to be about US$36 billion-only slightly less than the $38 billion spent by all Brazilian states and municipalities. 16 Since the establishment of SUS, access to health care has increased, and use has become more equitable across regions and income groups. Out-of-pocket payment patterns vary across income groups. Among the poorest group, direct expenditures are spent mainly on purchasing of medicine. The richest group spends proportionally less on diagnostic tests, but is the heaviest consumers of these procedures. 17 Unable to aff ord private health plans, and paying proportionally higher out-of-pocket rates (19%), access is most diffi cult for the lower middle-class. These patterns suggest overuse in the private sector, and underuse in the public sector. Evidence also suggests that the private sector's size creates unfair competition, drawing services and fi nancial and human resources from SUS, 16 which contributes to inequity, ineffi ciency, and low eff ectiveness.",

This eff ort will require additional fi nancial resources; however, compared with 2012, public funding in the 2013-16 budgets increases spending by only 4%. Gross domestic product (GDP) spent on health is expected to decrease from 3\u00b77% in 2012, to 3\u00b74% in 2016. 25 Related to this fact is the regional distribution, variability in resources, and broad income inequalities. 26 Per-head public health funding has diff ered between four and fi ve times between regions, and this diff erence has increased in the past decade. There are considerable divergences in access. According to a 2003 survey, patients receiving free inpatient care without any additional payment ranged from 74\u00b72% to 55\u00b77% in diff erent regions. 27 Another key challenge is how to combine the guarantees of free health-care provision with the reality of private health fi nancing.

Since 2005, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) has improved primary maternal and child health services, but does not yet provide necessary primary and secondary care. Government-funded schemes form the largest component of health insurance. Government employees are entitled to care at public facilities and are compensated for costs at recognised private facilities. These schemes are supplemented by several new national or state insurance programmes. Managed by the Ministry of Labour and introduced in 2008, Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) is one of the most prominent new schemes, and covers hospital care for around 120 million Indians. 32, 33 Although the scheme does provide access to both public and accredited private providers, it does not cover outpatient care, primary care, or high-level tertiary care. Financial protection is also not assured, because hospital costs and outpatient costs are beyond the coverage limit. 34 State schemes in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Rajasthan have mostly provided access to tertiary care, with varying levels of cost coverage.",

The heavily contested political nature of health reform is also evident in each country. Increases in public funding can be used to show how BRICS health ministries could usefully engage. Table 2 suggests that all BRICS countries have in recent years devoted more public funding to health. The biggest increase was in China, albeit from a very low base. This increase is likely to have been facilitated by China's rapid economic growth rate.

Future research to understand why there have been such diff erent levels of prioritisation of the health sector in China and India could be useful. Brazil, Russia, and South Africa have all had far lower economic growth rates, and all face opposition to increases in public spending on health because of the present economic crisis.

The BRICS group was established as a set of emerging economies with the potential to exert considerable infl uence regionally and globally. Although the BRICS formation was initially based on macroeconomic interests, the BRICS countries have the potential to be important leaders on a range of social policies. In view of South Africa and Brazil's previous commitments to UHC, through the Foreign Policy and Global Health group and within discussions on the post-2015 agenda for health, 56 the BRICS group will probably also focus on and advocate for UHC. The latest BRICS Health Communiqu\u00e9 supported the recent UN resolution on UHC, and stated the countries are \"committed to work nationally, regionally and globally to ensure that UHC is achieved\". 57 If they are not leading by example in making progress, it will be of little value for BRICS to individually and collectively advocate for UHC. The BRICS countries must succeed in moving towards UHC, not only because they account for nearly half the world's population, but also because they serve as important role models for other countries within their respective regions. In view of this opportunity to expand infl uence further through UHC and the chance to exchange and share learning on how to best achieve UHC, it seems likely that as the BRICS Ministers of Health Group continues to meet, they will increase their focus on UHC.",
