            "text": "This paper discusses the application of optimal and sub-optimal controls to a SEQIJR SARS model via the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. To this end, two control variables representing the quarantine and isolation strategies are considered in the model. The numerical optimal control laws are implemented in an iterative method, and the sub-optimal solution is computed using a genetic algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the maximal applications of quarantining and isolation strategies in the early stage of the epidemic are of very critical impacts in both cases of optimal and sub-optimal control. Otherwise, the control effect will be much worse. This gives a theoretical interpretation to the practical experiences that the early quarantine and isolation strategies are critically important to control the outbreaks of epidemics. Furthermore, our results also show that the proposed suboptimal control can lead to performances close to the optimal control, but with much simpler strategies for long periods of time in practical use.",

Since there are no valid medicines or vaccines for SARS, measures to control the spread of SARS had to take two major forms: isolation of symptomatic individuals and quarantining and close observation of asymptomatic individuals [2] . It had been shown that quarantining and isolating diseased individuals is a critically important strategy that can control SARS outbreaks, because of a reduction in the contact rate between susceptible and diseased individuals [2] [3] [4] . Moreover, Gumel [3] examines the impact of isolation and quarantine on the control of SARS during the outbreaks in Toronto, Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing in a mathematical way. It uses a deterministic model that closely mimics the data for cumulative infected cases and SARS-related deaths.",

            "text": "Wang and Ruan [9] propose a mathematical model consists of six subpopulations, namely susceptible, exposed, quarantined, suspect, probable, and removed, to simulate the SARS outbreak in Beijing. Chowell and Castillo-Chavez [10] use the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive number R 0 to assess the role that the model parameters play in outbreak control, and the results show that the transmission rate and isolation effectiveness have the largest fractional effect on R 0 . Shi [11] and Lloyd-Smith [12] present a stochastic dynamic model of SARS spreading, and a stochastic model of a SARS outbreak in a community and its hospital, respectively. Furthermore, small-world networks have been introduced to study the propagation of SARS by Naoki Masuda [13] and Small [14] . It has been shown that if all infectious individuals are isolated as rapidly as they are identified, the severity of the outbreak would be minimal [14] . Moreover, Gumel [3] and Chowell [4] attempt to obtain a threshold for the basic reproductive number R 0 for assessing the strategies of quarantine and isolation, and discuss the control of SARS by looking at the role of disease transmission parameters in the reduction of R 0 and the prevalence of the disease, while the discrete case has been studied by Zhou and Ma [15] . However, those models do not consider control strategies, since their discussions are based on prevalence of disease at equilibria. In Swan's work [16] , optimal control theory is applied to obtain maximal benefits in terms of social benefits from the parsimonious use of insufficient public funds in the control of epidemics. Moreover, the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle [17] and the time dependent control strategies are also applied for the studies of HIV models [18] , mosquito-borne diseases [19] , insect transmitted diseases [20] , dengue models [21] , tuberculosis models [22] and others [23] .",

In this work, the optimal control was computed using the multiple shooting method with 30 nodes, up to a tolerance of 10 \u22125 for |h|. Considering the four weight factors associated with E, Q, I and J , we choose B 1 = B 2 = B 3 = B 4 = 1, C 1 = 300 and C 2 = 600 to illustrate the optimal strategies. Remark 3. We assume that the weight factor C 2 associated with control u 2 is much larger than C 1 , which is associated with control u 1 . This assumption is based on the following facts: The cost associated with u 1 mainly includes the cost of monitoring and quarantining programs, while the cost associated with u 2 includes the cost of monitoring and isolating programs, and the hospital treatment resource. The ideal weights are very hard to obtain in practice. It needs a lot of work on data mining, analyzing, and fitting. Hence, the acquisition of appropriate practical weights is a difficult problem and it still remains for further investigations. It should be pointed out that the weights in the simulations here are of only theoretical interest to illustrate the control strategies proposed in this paper. 1 .

We choose the upper bound of u 1 equals 0.50, according to the reasonable case in China that it took at least an average of 2 days to quarantine the asymptomatic individuals who had been exposed to the virus, but had not yet developed clinical symptoms. And the choice of upper bound of u 2 is similar to u 1 . The sub-optimal control was computed for the case N = 3 and specified time intervals: \u2206 1 = 60, \u2206 2 = 240 and \u2206 3 = 60. Parameters such as population size for the genetic algorithm, generation gap and others were adjusted ad hoc [21] . The data and parameters we used, as shown in Table 1 , are mainly from the published data [3, 9] . In order to evaluate the effect of the uncertainty on the model parameters, simulations were repeated with values of \u03b2, \u03b5 E , \u03b5 Q , \u03b5 J , \u00b5, k 1 , k 2 , d 1 , d 2 , \u03c3 1 and \u03c3 2 , altered by random values in the range \u00b110% (normal distribution), while the inputs u 1 and u 2 were kept identical to the computed optimal values. Fig. 1 shows the time dependent optimal and sub-optimal quarantine and isolation control laws. In order to minimize the total infected individuals, E + Q + I + J , the optimal control u 1 is at its upper bound during more than the half of the year, and then u 1 is steadily decreased to the lower bound, while the optimal control u 2 stays at its upper bound for a short time, about 70 days and then steadily decreases to the lower bound over the rest simulated time. The sub-optimal control laws u 1 and u 2 stay at the upper bound during the first two time intervals and the first time interval, respectively.",

For both u 1 and u 2 , the steady decrease to the lower bound in the optimal control case, and the staying at a proper value in the sub-optimal case, are determined by the balance between the cost of the infected individuals and the cost of the controls. A comparison of the optimal control, the sub-optimal control and the constant controls u 1 \u2261 0.2 and u 2 \u2261 0.2 throughout the simulated time are also implemented (Fig. 2) . It is easy to see that the optimal control and sub-optimal control are much more effective for reducing the number of infected individuals and decreasing the time-span of the epidemic. As normally expected, in the early phase of the epidemic breakouts, keeping the quarantine and isolation controls at their upper bounds will directly lead to decreasing of the number of the infected people. Moreover, Fig. 3 shows that if we take the lower bound values for each control throughout the simulated time, the number of infected individuals would reach about 4.1919 \u00d7 10 6 (nearly 35% of the total population). This illustrates that the quarantine and isolation strategies are critically important to control the outbreaks of SARS. In addition, in order to illustrate the overall of picture of the epidemic, the number of infected and recovered individuals under the optimal control, the sub-optimal control, the constant control and the lower bound control are shown, respectively, in Figs. 4-9. The costs achieved by the optimal control and sub-optimal control are much less than the constant control and the lower bound control, as shown in Figs. 10 and 11. It is interesting to note that the cost achieved by the sub-optimal control is very close to that of the optimal control, despite the fact that the sub-optimal control is much easier to implement than the optimal control.",

Furthermore, this idea of introducing these two new control variables is helpful for further discussions on catastrophic epidemic control. It should be pointed out that, as was mentioned in [23] , the ideal time-varying optimal strategy might not be applied in practice easily. Nevertheless, it does provide a reference basis on which to design the practical quasi-optimal control strategies or policies, and to assess their effectiveness. However, the proposed sub- Fig. 10 .
