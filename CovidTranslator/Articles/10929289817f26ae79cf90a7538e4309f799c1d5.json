Eimeria related signs (diarrhoea, presence of pathogenic species and total oocyst count) were combined resulting a four level variable. Calves with weak signs of eimeriosis had decreased haptoglobin concentrations (p = 0.02) and increased fibrinogen concentrations (p = 0.048) compared to no signs. Increased haptoglobin and fibrinogen concentrations were associated with respiratory tract infection and umbilical infection.

Clinical eimeriosis (coccidiosis) manifests itself as moderate to severe, and sometimes bloody, diarrhoea, inappetence and lethargy [1] . Chronic or subclinical eimeriosis reduces growth rate and can result in considerable economic losses [2, 3] . As the mere presence of Eimeria spp. is not conclusive for them being the etiologic agents of diarrhoea, an oocyst count of pathogenic species of 500 oocyst per gram of faeces (opg) in calves with simultaneous signs of diarrhoea has been used to indicate eimeriosis for research purposes [4, 5] . The oocysts are formed during gamogony, which with second merogony is the most disruptive stage for the intestine in the Eimeria life cycle [1] . The histopathological lesions during gamogony in the ileum include oedema, congestion, haemorrhage, mucosal ulceration, blunting of mucosal ridges and ulceration of the lamina propria [6] .",

One indicator of the innate immune response is the synthesis of the acute phase proteins (APPs) that are synthesised in the liver at the beginning of the acute phase of the inflammatory response initiated by infection, neoplasia or tissue destruction [8] . The initial location or cause of the inflammation cannot be determined with APP measurements, but the magnitude of the increase correlates with the extent and acuteness of the inflammation [9] . Most studies concentrate on the changes in haptoglobin (Hp), serum amyloid A (SAA) and fibrinogen (Fb), the major acute phase proteins in cattle [10] . In calves, research has concentrated on experimental and natural respiratory infections, where the association with the disease and the APPs has been confirmed [11, 12] . Association between diarrhoea and increased APP concentrations or intestinal pathogens and increased APP concentrations has also been studied, but the results are inconclusive [13, 14] . As severe tissue destruction occurs during eimeriosis, the acute phase response would be expected to follow [7] .",

The idea of the multiple correspondence analysis is to carry out cross-tabulations of multiple categorical variables simultaneously and explore relationships within a set of categorical variables, resulting in two-dimensional scatterplot summary. In the summary, clusters of points are associated with each other, and clusters furthest from the inter-section of the axes have the strongest internal association [27] . Test values were computed for evaluating variables' correlation with model dimensions (axes). The test values were considered to be the standardised coordinates and were interpreted as the number of standard deviations from the centre of gravity of the analysis. Absolute test values higher than the threshold value of 1.96 were considered to be statistically significant. For the MCA, the Cryptosporidium findings from immunofluorescence staining were used. The MCA was conducted with XLSTAT (Version 2010.4.01, Addinsoft) software.",

Based on clinical examination, calves were categorised having the signs of: diarrhoea (pastylike or watery faeces), respiratory infection (temperature >39.5 \u2022 C, respiratory rate >40/min, and increased respiratory sounds), umbilical infection (enlarged, warm or tender umbilicus), joint lesion (swelling, abrasions or heat in the joint or on the skin close to the joint) or healthy (none of the previous conditions applicable). Calves having simultaneously signs of diarrhoea and any other signs were placed into the category of the other sign, considered the primary sign, so each calf had only one condition or was categorised as healthy. The final variable \"Signs of diseases\" was generated by combining all the individual signs. For forming eimeriosis severity categories three criteria related with Eimeria infection were assessed: presence of diarrhoea, total oocyst count >500 opg in faecal sample and presence of pathogenic Eimeria species (E. bovis or E. zuernii). If no criteria was met no evidence of eimeriosis was recorded (category 1), if one of the criteria was met the evidence of eimeriosis was considered weak (category 2), if two criteria were met the evidence was considered moderate (category 3), and if all three criteria were met the evidence were considered strong (category 4). Associations between severity of eimeriosis and APP concentrations were examined by linear mixed model; separate models were built Hp, SAA, Fb, or WBC as an outcome. Age, gender and \"Signs of disease\" were added into the models to control their possible effect on acute phase proteins or WBC. \"Gender\" was removed, if no effect was detected. Each intestinal pathogen (rotavirus, Giardia spp., or Cryptosporidium spp.) was also inserted to the model, but none showed significant results. Herd was included as a random effect in all models. For the model using SAA as an outcome, the variable \"positive finding from respiratory tract samples\" (yes/no) was added, as the examination of the data showed a possible connection of positive respiratory tract sample and SAA concentration. Inverse transformation for Hp, Fb and WBC and logarithmic transformation for SAA were used in the linear mixed model to normalise the data. The difference of intestinal pathogen frequency over age groups (age in weeks) was tested by Fisher's exact test. The Fisher's exact test, linear modelling and the diagnostics were done using Stata/IC 11.2 for Windows (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). p values <0.05 were considered indicating statistically significant difference.",

A relatively low cut-off point at 500 opg of total oocyst count (modified from Mundt et al.

Studies exploring the acute phase response and Eimeria are few. A positive acute phase response and a pro-inflammatory cytokine response have been reported in experimentally induced caprine coccidiosis [42] , supporting the existence of systemic response at least in experimental studies.

Hp exists in blood at very low concentrations, when no inflammation process is in progress [8] . Eimeria merozoites induce haemorrhaging injuries on the wall of the intestine [6] , resulting in haemolysis and excessive amounts of haemoglobin in the tissues. Hp binds to haemoglobin, thus decreasing the amount of measurable Hp determined by the haemoglobin binding method used in this study. Arthington et al. [44] discovered an unexpected and unexplained decrease in Hp concentrations when exploring how transporting and commingling calves affects the acute phase response, and initial decrease in Hp concentration was also observed in the early phase of experimental E. coli mastitis [45] . Hp binding to haemoglobin could explain these observations, as minor, haemorrhaging injuries or haemolysis can occur in these stressful situations or in the early phase of inflammation, where vascular permeability increases.",

Our group of \"healthy\" includes some calves with some of the respiratory infection signs (temperature >39.5 \u2022 C, respiratory rate >40/min, or increased respiratory sounds). The concentrations of SAA, sensitive to inflammation, might be affected by these minor signs of illness, as the models with Hp and Fb functioned despite the slightly indistinct definition of healthy.
