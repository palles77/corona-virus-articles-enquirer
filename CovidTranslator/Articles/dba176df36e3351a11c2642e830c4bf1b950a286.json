However, no virus has been shown to be the direct cause of renal disease in man (Jensen, 1967; Smith and Aquino, 1971 ; Morrison and Wright, 1977) . Many different viruses have been isolated from human urine but there are no specific \"nephrotropic\" viruses comparable to the hepatitis viruses (Utz, 1974) . On the contrary, most human renal disease, especially chronic nephritis, is still of unknown aetiology (Pincherle, 1977) . Although the role of immune complexes in the pathogenesis of renal disease is well established, the nature of the antigens involved remains obscure (Sissons, 1975) .",

The kidneys showed varying degrees of tubular damage and interstitial infiltration with mononuclear cells in the medullary tracts and in the cortex. In the cytoplasm of many cells of the tubules basophilic inclusions were seen. These probably represent the viral inclusion bodies seen by electron microscopy and have not been reported in previous studies. Airdried cryostat sections of frozen kidney fixed in cold acetone and stained by May-Griinwald Giemsa and viewed in polarizing light showed widespread accumulation of urate crystals in the tubules of moribund birds with enlarged kidneys. When the same sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, vacuoles in tubular cells and the lumen were obvious. Presumably, these are sites where the crystals had been dissolved. In control kidneys, only very few and fine crystals were seen. ~~~~no~u~resce~~ jindings. Virus-specific fluorescence was demonstrated in tracheal smears from moribund and dead chicks, and also in infected birds with no clinical signs. Specific cytoplasmic fluorescence was seen in the tubules of enlarged kidneys from all dead or moribund chicks as scattered foci in tubular epithelial cells in both cortex and medullary areas (Fig. 1) mainly in the proximal tubules, although other segments also showed some staining.",

In group 1 birds, at the 20th week after infection, 4 showed very high HI antibody titres (1 :I28 to 1:512), while 4 others showed lower HI titres 1: 32). These sera were then titrated by the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) method with IBV-infected primary chick kidney cultures as substrate. Although the IFA titres corresponded well with the HI titres, the differences were smaller (I:80 to 1:320), indicating that all these birds had high titres of anti-IBV antibody.

Although, during viraemia, the virus may infect many visceral organs, it presumably persists only in the kidneys. The virus infection could spread along the tubules, as it was found frequently that whole lengths of tubule showed specific immunofluorescence alongside other normal tubules. In very young chicks (less than 2 weeks of age) severe necrotic changes were found in the tubules, with little mononuclear cell infiltration. From the histology, the specific immunofluorescence findings and the electron microscopic evidence of virus replication in the tubular cells, it may be concluded that the pathological changes result from the cytolytic action of the virus.

However, contamination of caecal lymph nodes by faeces cannot be excluded.

The persistence of high titres of IBV antibody and the mononuclear infiltration indicate adequate immune response. It is known that persistent viral infection can occur in immunologically competent hosts and that some virus infection may persist in the presence of neutralizing antibodies (No&ins, 1974) . Although there are many factors which may contribute to such persistent infections (Porter, 1975) , most of these have not been investigated for IBV infection. However, there are 2 features of coronavirus replication which may contribute to the persistence of the infection. Firstly, coronaviruses do not appear to induce new viral antigens on the cell surface (Oshiro, Schieble and Lennette, 197 1) . Secondly, most coronaviruses, including IBV, readily induce cell fusion. These properties may enable IBV to replicate and spread to neighbouring cells without alerting the host's immunological defencrs.",

Lastly, although the chronic nephritis caused by IBV in chickens could be a good model for studies on persistent virus infections, the relevance to human chronic nephritis remains to be established. SUMMARY Nephritis in chickens caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was studied by virological, histological and electron microscopical methods. The T strain of the virus caused only mild respiratory signs in both Rhode Island Red (RIR) and White Leghorn (WL) breeds; the 50 per cent mortality induced was due to acute nephritis. All the infected birds developed high titres of antibody to IBV for up to 30 weeks. In spite of the persistence of antibody, about 35 per cent of the RIR developed chronic progressive nephritis. The histology showed varying degrees of pathological changes in the tubules, with relatively unaffected glomeruli. Foci of mononuclear cell infiltration were prominent in the cortex and medulla, particularly in chronic nephritis. Cytoplasmic IBV immunofluorescence was found in all segments of the tubules, but not in the glomeruli.",
