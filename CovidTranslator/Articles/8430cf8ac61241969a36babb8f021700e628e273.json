Th e primary target organ is the respiratory tract, where initial infection and disease occurs. IBV also aff ects egg-laying performance, and renal damage associated with infectious bronchitis has become increasingly important, particularly in broilers. Economically, the most important aspects are the eff ects on egg production and quality in laying hens and production performance in broilers, where the initial respiratory infection is frequently exacerbated by secondary infections.",

            "text": "Th e IBV contains four structural proteins: a surface projection, known as the spike, a nucleoprotein, a membrane protein and a small membrane protein. Th e spike (S) glycoprotein is responsible for attachment to and fusion of the virus membrane with the host cell membrane, as well as for inducing protective immune responses. Molecular studies have shown that the S gene of IBV is also responsible for determining the serotype or genotype of an IB virus or variant. It is now known that only a small number of amino acid changes in the S1 part of the spike can result in what is defi ned by laboratory tests as a new variant. Since it is possible for concurrent infection with more than one type of IBV to occur, new variants may emerge as a result of both recombination between two diff erent IBVs, as well as by mutations of the genome. Many diff erent IBV variants are recognized both on the basis of antigenic variation, determined by virus neutralization (VN) tests, and increasingly by molecular analysis of the genome (genotyping). Variants of economic importance include: Massachusetts, which is the serotype most commonly found worldwide; Connecticut, Arkansas and Delaware 072 from the USA; T from Australia; D274; D1466; 793B (4/91); B1648; Italian 02 from Europe, and so on. IBVs in Australia have evolved in their own distinct lineages and other areas, for example parts of south-east Asia, have their own unique IBV variants, as well as ones found in other parts of the world. Th e number of new IBV variants continues to increase as simpler methods for their detection become available. While these diff erent variants are important epidemiologically, their signifi cance in terms of control of infection is less clear. Th is is because new variants are defi ned by a very small number of amino acid changes, so that the majority of the genome is conserved.",

In some cases, analysis of the genome of these coronaviruses has shown them to be IBV, and examples exist to indicate both reisolation of a vaccine strain and isolation of a virulent fi eld strain. However, some recent coronavirus isolates from gallinaceous birds, for example mallard duck and a pigeon, have two small extra genes near the 3\u0408 end of the genome, indicating that they cannot be classifi ed as IBV and may represent new species. Th is is a new area of investigation and, while the coronaviruses detected in some gallinaceous and nongallinaceous birds have not so far been associated with disease, these species are potential carriers of IBV and other coronaviruses and could therefore play a role in global transmission of infection.",

After a short incubation period of 1-3 days, bird-to-bird transmission occurs rapidly and signs are seen in most birds in a susceptible fl ock. Virus is shed via both the respiratory tract and the faeces and a high standard of biosecurity is essential to minimize both entry of infection to a fl ock and spread between fl ocks. Th e virus may be shed for several weeks after clinical recovery and can persist in the intestinal tract for several months. Th e virus is rapidly killed by common disinfectants but its survival in the environment has not been adequately studied. Direct airborne transmission of virus from the respiratory tract to susceptible birds is probably the most common method of spread, particularly when respiratory signs are present. However, transmission through infected faeces is also important and spread by fomites certainly occurs. Th e greatest source of infection is birds in which virus is rapidly replicating.

Whatever protocol is followed, a highly attenuated live virus vaccine is given initially. For broilers this is likely to be given in the hatchery by coarse spray. Revaccination of broilers, possibly at 2-3 weeks of age, is now common practice in some areas. In order that protection against both infectious bronchitis and Newcastle disease may be achieved by one application of vaccine, the two vaccines may be combined. Because of the risk that, if it is present in excess, the infectious bronchitis vaccine may interfere with the response to the Newcastle disease vaccine, the use of a combined product is preferable to the use of two separate vaccines given together. For future breeders or layers, the fi rst vaccination is usually given at about 3 weeks of age, in the drinking water or by spray, and may be followed by one or more further applications of live attenuated vaccine. Before onset of lay an inactivated vaccine is given intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Increasingly, the inactivated vaccine is likely to be a multivalent one containing possibly two diff erent IBV antigens, as well as antigens to other important poultry pathogens.",

            "text": "Excellent protection against homologous challenge is obtained, provided that vaccination is carried out carefully. However, there is now increasing evidence that licensed vaccines provide heterologous protection against challenge with some diff erent IBV serotypes or variants, although it is not currently possible to predict when this might occur based on either serotyping or genotyping. Recent data suggest that, if two antigenically distinct live-attenuated IBV vaccines are applied, preferably separated by at least 2 weeks, good protection may be achieved against challenge with a range of heterologous IBV serotypes. Th is is probably because of the very small number of amino acid diff erences between diff erent serotypes or variants in the immunity-inducing part of the virus.",

Th is is because local and cell-mediated immunity are very important in protecting against IBV challenge but are diffi cult to measure by currently available methods. Locally produced antibody in the upper respiratory tract is the important fi rst line of defence against IBV challenges. It is therefore very important that the live attenuated infectious bronchitis vaccines are applied very carefully to ensure good, even stimulation of local antibody in every bird.",
