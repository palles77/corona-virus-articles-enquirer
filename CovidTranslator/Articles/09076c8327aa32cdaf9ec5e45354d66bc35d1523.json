We previously observed that membrane potential depolarization enhances the release of HIV-1 viruses. Because membrane polarization affects the biomembrane directly, here we examined the effects of KCNK3/9/15 on the budding of nonviral vesicles. We found that depolarization by knocking down endogenous KCNK3/9/15 promoted secretion of cell-derived vesicles. We further used Vpu (an antagonist of KCNK3) as a model for the in vivo study of depolarization-stimulated secretion. Vpu is a HIV-1-encoded, ion channel-like protein (viroporin) capable of enhancing virus release and depolarizing the cell membrane potential. We found that Vpu could also promote nonviral vesicle release, perhaps through a similar mechanism that Vpu utilizes to promote viral particle release. Notably, T cells expressing Vpu alone became pathologically low in intracellular K ? and insensitive to extracellular K ? or membrane potential stimulation. In contrast, heterologous expression of KCNK3 in T cells stabilized the cell potentials by maintaining intracellular K ? . We thus concluded that KCNK3/9/15 expression limits membrane depolarization and depolarization-induced secretion at least in part by maintaining intracellular K ? .",

            "text": "Vesicle secretion is an essential step for many physiological and pathophysiological processes. By releasing specific, submicron-sized vesicles, cells communicate or cross-talk with other cells and the surrounding microenvironment/systems. These cell-derived exovesicles are generated from intracellular compartments or the plasma membrane through a series of fusion and fission events. Although the origins/functions of these cell-derived exovesicles are various, their fundamental biophysical properties (e.g. fusogenicity) are similar. Most exovesicles have the capability to fuse with target cells in order to deliver cargo and transmit information. For example, the exovesicles secreted by mature dendritic cells (DCs), a type of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), bear antigen-loaded MHC molecules. When these exovesicles fuse with immature DCs, the antigens are transferred from mature to immature DCs [1] . This process could increase the number of APCs and amplify the immune responses. Besides information transmission mediated by fusion, the surface of a secreted vesicle can also serve as an antigen/biomarker-loaded presentation platform for various purposes [2] . This is best illustrated with the many types of tumor cell-derived microvesicles and exosomes. The tumor antigen-loaded exovesicles usually function to suppress a wide spectrum of immune responses, but some of them secreted under stress could also counterintuitively activate the immunity [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . In recent years, our understanding for the compositions and functions of cell-secreted vesicles has grown exponentially [2, 8, 9] . This report explores a lesser known aspect about the physical mechanism of vesicle biogenesis.",

Another universal regulator is membrane potential stability, which is largely contributed by background K ? channels [11, 12] . Many background K ? channels, known as two-pore K ? (K 2P ) channels, share a unique two-pore (P) and four-transmembrane (2P/4TM) configuration per channel subunit. The K 2P (KCNK) channel family is extensively distributed in eukaryotes, and can be further divided into six subfamilies (TWIK, TREK/TRAAK, TASK, THIK, TALK, and TRESK) based on their primary sequence homology and channel properties [11] . Compared to other potassium channel families, K 2P channels play fundamental physiological functions, such as maintenance of membrane potential stability and regulation of cellular excitability, and are thus considered to have evolved earlier than the other K ? channel families [11] .",

As a proof of concept, the first aim of this study was to identify the role of KCNK3/9/15 (TASK1/3/5) channels during the exocytosis process. We previously demonstrated that depolarization by KCNK3/9/15 knockdown could accelerate HIV-1 viral release [16] . Here we found that membrane depolarization by KCNK3/9/15 siRNA or by Vpu also promoted the release of cell-derived, nonviral vesicles. Some of these cell-derived exovesicles were exosomes, enriched with the lipid second messenger-ceramide. To further dissect the nature of depolarization-stimulated secretion in vivo, we measured intracellular K ? (K in ? ) in Vpu? cells, and found it to be depleted to a pathologically low level. Reduction of intracellular K ? drives membrane potential depolarization. In contrast, heterologous expression of KCNK3 channels in primary T cells maintained K in ? , thereby reinforcing membrane polarization and suppressing depolarization-stimulated exocytosis. Our results identify the Dw-modulatory function of KCNK3/9/15 channels and Vpu viroporin in the exocytosis process.",

At t 0 on the day of experimentation, the inserts, each layered with at least 10 6 cells, were transferred to a new 6-well culture plate containing 2 ml of HBSS or a high K ? balanced buffer. The compositions of high K ? balanced solutions were modified based on HBSS to keep the sum of [K ? ] and [Na ? ] constant. At each time point following t 0 (every 15 or 30 min), 125 lL of the buffer outside the insert in a well was retrieved and transferred to a Fluo-roNunc 96-well plate. The samples collected at each time point were stained with 5 lM of fluorescent lipid dye trimethylammonio-diphenylhexatriene (TMA-DPH, Invitrogen). TMA-DPH was excited at 350 nm and its fluorescence emission spectra were collected by SpectraMAX Gemini XS (Molecular Devices). TMA-DPH emission at each time point was subtracted with its background value obtained at t 0 , and was normalized with respect to the emission values of the control cells (set 100%). Fig. 1a ). These exovesicles were not morphologically very different from those originated from the cells incubated in 5 mM K ? . But it was not possible to accurately determine whether there were more exovesicles released from the depolarized cells by TEM. We quantified exovesicle release by fluorescence labeling of these exovesicles with a fluorescent lipid probe-TMA-DPH. TMA-DPH primarily anchors onto the positively-charged polar head groups of phospholipids [42] . Upon binding to lipid, TMA-DPH emits fluorescence; this probe does not fluoresce in aqueous solutions [43] . Because TMA-DPH fast and readily partitions between lipid and water, it has been used for labeling of exocytosed membrane [44, 45] . We validated this TMA-DPH-based, quantitative method with Jurkat cells (a cell line of T lymphocytes), and found an excellent linear correlation between the amount of TMA-DPH labeling and the quantities of cells or cell membrane (Fig. 1b) .",

To quantify vesicle release induced by depolarization, HeLa cells were transferred to a well filled with a high K ? balanced buffer at t 0 . Compared to the negative-control set immersed in 5 mM K ? , high K ? -induced depolarization enhanced vesicle release by *2 folds (Fig. 1d) . Similar depolarization-stimulated release has also been observed in HEK-293 cells and in activated human CD4? T cells.",

An aliquot of HBSS outside the insert was retrieved for TMA-DPH labeling every 15 min. We found that the cells depolarized by KCNK3/9/15 siRNA indeed secreted more vesicles than the control, non-depolarized cells (Fig. 3b) . Both means of Dw reduction ((1) high K out ? and (2) KCNK3/9/15 siRNA) enhanced vesicle secretion (Figs. 1, 2) . We observed *50% more TMA-DPH-labeled membranes due to the expression of depolarizing Vpu (Fig. 3) . The differences between Vpu? and GFP? groups were significant (*P \\ 0.05 from 5 independent experiments), albeit that the increase of secretion by Vpu (*50% in Fig. 3 ) was smaller than that by KCNK3/9/15 siRNA or by high K out ?

Because TMA-DPH also stains lipids and membranous debris, we also checked the content of secretion at the end of a typical TMA-DPH experiment (as in Fig. 3) using another TEM technique. The exocytosed particles outside the insert were isolated and concentrated by ultracentrifugation (up to 100,0009g). Under a TEM, the 0.4-lmsieved, exocytosed vesicles looked like ''half-deflated balloons'' (Fig. 4a) . Others have pointed out that these variations in EM preparation could make these submicronsized vesicles look ''cup-shaped'' [8] . For confirmation and comparison, we also isolated exosomes released from human reticulocytes. The reticulocyte-derived exosomes also exhibited irregular or cup shapes (Fig. 4b) , similar to those vesicles secreted from the depolarized T cells (Fig. 4a) .",

            "text": "The sizes of these secreted vesicles were less than 200 nm in diameter and somewhat heterogeneous (Fig. 4a, b) . Thus, the secretion pools probably included various types of vesicles, such as exosomes (40-100 nm in diameter) [36] , exosome-like vesicles (20-50 nm) [46] , membrane particles (50-80 nm) [2, 47] , and few microvesicles (100-1,000 nm) [48] . Despite that these exovesicles might have originated from various intracellular compartments and/or the plasma membrane, minimization of membrane potential polarization could induce their secretion. Thus, membrane depolarization is likely a general mechanism for vesicle biogenesis/ release. We further attempted to characterize these depolarization-induced exovesicles with biomarkers. In particular, we were interested in the fraction of exosomes in the secretion pool, since exosomes are biologically important and have been well characterized. We first confirmed that human reticulocyte-derived exosomes were enriched with transferrin receptor (TrnR). For convenience, we then used K562 cultured cells (of an erythroleukemic type) to generate sufficient quantities of exovesicles for this study. K562 cells were transiently transfected with GFP or GFP/Vpu, and the exovesicles secreted from these cells were concentrated by ultracentrifugation. Some of the exovesicles secreted from K562 cells also expressed transferrin receptors (TrnR), suggesting that they might be exosomes. On the other hand, not many exovesicles secreted from K562 cells or human reticulocytes expressed CD81, a tetraspanin protein and an exosome marker specific for antigen-presenting cells (data not shown). Since exosome markers are cell type-dependent, and both K562 cells and reticulocytes are not antigen-presenting cells, their exovesicles should indeed contain very little CD81. Because membrane potential depolarization should be a universal, physical mechanism for stimulation of secretion, we chose a more generalized biomarker-ceramide, to characterize these exovesicles. Ceramide is a marker for the Golgi apparatus, exosomes, and the secretory pathway for exosomes [35, 49] . We established a flow cytometrybased quantitative method for ceramide. Since the cellderived exovesicles were too small (\\200 nm in diameters) for flow cytometry, they were first labeled with BODIPY Fig. 4 The depolarization-stimulated exovesicle pool contained exosomes. Many vesicles induced by depolarization from IL-2-activated CD4? T cells (a) exhibited similar morphology as the exosomes released from human reticulocytes (b). Depolarization was induced by knockdown of endogenous KCNK3/9/15 (a, left) or by Vpu expression (a, right). Human T cells or reticulocytes were cultured on cell culture inserts of 0.4-lm-porous membrane in a 6-well plate overnight. The culture media outside the inserts were collected to extract the secreted exosomes/vesicles. The isolated and concentrated vesicles were then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and deposited onto Formvar-carbon coated EM grids. The sample-loaded grids were further washed, fixed, and stained with uranyl acetate. These membranous particles were visualized by JEOL JEM-1200EXII. Bar = 200 nm. c A significant portion of the exovesicles were exosomes. The fluorescent probe, BODIPY TR C 5 -ceramide, was used to label exosomes for flow cytometric analyses. The vesicle-coated beads were found monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric in a FSC/SSC dot plot, as gated (left). BODIPY TR C 5 -ceramide labeling could be detected by the FL-2 channel for red fluorescence. BODIPY TR C 5 -ceramide-stained exovesicles were gated in the upper-right quadrant of the dot plot. For each experimental set, the control group (unstained exovesicles) was also shown, and gated in the lower-right quadrant. Over 90% of the reticulocyte-derived exosomes were positively labeled by BODIPY TR C 5 -ceramide. About half of the exovesicle population from the GFP/Vpu-transfected cells was exosomes Cell Biochem Biophys (2011) 61:585-594 591 TR C 5 -ceramide, and then coated onto aldehyde/sulfatetreated latex beads. We found that most reticulocytederived exosomes were loaded with ceramide (91.1%, Fig. 4c ). The ceramide levels were significant in *42.7% of the exovesicles originated from GFP? cells, and in *50.1% of the exovesicles from GFP/Vpu? cells (Fig. 4c ). There were also populations of non-exosome vesicles in the secretion. Interestingly, Vpu expression might be able to promote exosome secretion, as it slightly increased the proportion of exosomes in the exovesicle pools.",

We directly measured [K ? ] in by labeling intracellular K ? ions with a K ? -specific fluorescent indicator-PBFI. As shown in Fig. 5a , increasing the extracellular K ? concentration forced [K ? ] in to increase in a non-linear fashion. Noticeably, heterologous expression of Vpu alone in the activated CD4? T cells rendered the cells to be significantly less sensitive to [K ? ] out changes, indicating a lack of K ? channel expression on their plasma membrane (Fig. 5a) . Importantly, the intracellular K ? content was significantly lower in Vpu? cells (Fig. 5a) . Because Vpu could form viroporins by itself or oligomerize with host channel subunits [16, 51] , its disruption of normal cell electrophysiology conceivably could result in a constitutive leak of intracellular K ? (Fig. 5) . From the Nernst equation, the changes of intracellular and extracellular K ? concentrations directly affect the cell membrane potential. With a decrease in [K ? ] in and insensitivity to [K ? ] out , the differences between [K ? ] in and [K ? ] out for Vpu? cells were minimized, and consequently their membrane potentials were more depolarized (Fig. 5b) . In contrast, KCNK3? cells showed higher [K ? ] in than the control cells throughout most [K ? ] out tested (Fig. 5a) , and thus their cell membrane potentials were more polarized (Fig. 5b) .",

            "text": "In this study, we demonstrated that depolarization by manipulating K ? gradients across the cell membrane could independently promote the release of membranous particles from common cultured cell lines (i.e. HEK-293 and HeLa cells) and from activated human CD4? T cells (Figs. 1, 2) . Depolarization by heterologous expression of Vpu also stimulated the release of nonviral vesicles in primary T cells (Fig. 3) . Since depolarization could lower the electrostatic repulsion on a vesicle-budding membrane [16, 53] , our results suggest that the electric field across a cell membrane is an important energy barrier for vesicle biogenesis/secretion. We identified K in ? depletion as a major cause of depolarization in vivo (Fig. 5 ). An intracellular milieu of low ? , Vpu? cells were in average 13.2 mV more depolarized than GFP? cells, whereas KCNK3? cells were 15.5 mV more hyperpolarized than GFP? cells. For comparison, if the intracellular K ? concentration were set to be 145 mM throughout all [K ? ] out , the corresponding potentials (cross symbols) in theory would be more negative than the experimental data here K ? is favored by apoptosis [54] . Notably, Vpu can independently facilitate apoptosis [55] , so Vpu-mediated apoptosis might conceivably require the viroporin activity to disrupt intracellular K ? homeostasis and Dw. In comparison, heterologous expression of KCNK3 in human CD4? T cells prevented pathological leak of K in ? (Fig. 5a ) and stabilized the cells at polarized potentials (Fig. 5b) . Could KCNK3, an antagonist of Vpu, exert protection against apoptosis during HIV-1 infection? Liu et al. [56] have shown that membrane hyperpolarization driven by various K 2P channels, including KCNK3, inhibits activation of apoptosis during cell stress in cultured rat hippocampal slices. On the other hand, Lauritzen et al. [57] have shown that KCNK9 channels could result in K in ? depletion and activation of apoptosis instead. Conceivably, the differences in KCNK channel activities, Dw stability, and cellular regulation of KCNK expression could all influence K in ? homeostasis directly, resulting in inhibition or activation of apoptosis.",

T lymphocyte incubated in a high-K ? balanced buffer (extracellular [K ? ] = 73 mM). After 45 min of incubation in high K ? , the cells were fixed with an equal volume of 5% glutaraldehyde, followed by OsO 4 fixation. The cells were then gently spun down in a microcentrifuge tube for embedding and copolymerization. Thin-sections of the cells in resin blocks were visualized by TEM (JEOL JEM-1200EXII). Bar = 500 nm. b To validate the membrane quantitation method by TMA-DPH, Jurkat cells were divided into 4 groups of different cell numbers (ranging from 4.5 9 10 4 to 4.5 9 10 5 cells per group) for TMA-DPH labeling. The labeled cells were excited at 350 nm, and their emission was collected at 420-490 nm. For each E m wavelength tested, the fluorescence emission intensities all exhibited linear correlations with the quantities of cells or cell membrane (r 2 [ 0.99). Shown here were the linear correlations at E m 420 nm and 430 nm. c HeLa cells were plated in 6-well culture inserts of 0.4-lm-porous membrane. After 24-30 h of siRNA transfection, culture media outside the insert in each well were replaced with fresh ones, and a fraction of the sieved media (outside the culture insert in a well) were collected every 15 or 30 min for TMA-DPH labeling. As revealed by the TMA-DPH emission spectra at t 0 and t 30 (30 min of membrane secretion), the fluorescent emission of TMA-DPH was greatly enhanced upon binding to the exocytosed membranes. The maximal emission of TMA-DPH was determined at 445 nm excitation, and the E m at this excitation wavelength will be used for all the quantitative comparison below. d Membrane potential depolarization induced by a high-K ? buffer stimulated vesicle secretion. At t 0 , the culture inserts layered with HeLa cells were transferred to wells containing HBSS (5 mM K ? ) or a high K ? balanced buffer (60 mM K ? ). A fraction of the buffer outside the porous inserts was retrieved at each time point for TMA-DPH staining. At the end of secretion collection, the cells on the culture inserts were resuspended and transferred to a 96-well plate for measurements of TMA-DPH fluorescence intensities. The variations of cell membrane quantities from set to set were relatively small (\\5%), as compared to the changes due to high K ? stimulation ([50% in general). The experiments have been repeatedly observed in HEK-293 cells and in IL-2-activated human CD4? proof of principle, we also examined if Vpu, a viroporin of HIV-1 capable of depolarizing the cell membrane potential, could stimulate nonviral vesicle release.Heterologous expression of Vpu in primary CD4? T cells and in common cultured cells can depolarize the cell membrane potentials by 5-20 mV[13]. Here, IL-2-activated human CD4? T cells were transfected with vpu-GFP or GFP (control) plasmids on 0.4 lm-porous culture inserts. At t 0 of a secretion experiment, the culture inserts loaded with transfected cells were transferred to new wells filled with HBSS. For every 30 min, an aliquot of HBSS outside the inserts was retrieved for TMA-DPH labeling.",

The remaining expression of KCNK3 after knockdown was amplified by PCR and quantitatively compared by ImageJ. b Depolarization by KCNK3/9/ 15 knockdown stimulated secretion from HeLa cells. The experiments have also been repeatedly observed in HEK-293 cells and in IL-Vpu promoted secretion of nonviral vesicles. IL-2-activated human CD4? T lymphocytes were transfected with bicistronic plasmids pCGI (containing GFP) alone, or together with pCCI-Vpu, using AMAXA transfection reagents.

Lastly, the free aldehyde/sulfate groups of the beads were saturated in 100 mM glycine/PBS for 30 min, and washed twice with PBS containing 1% FCS. The expression of reporter gene GFP was assessed by the FL1 channel of a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and ceramide labeling was assessed by the red fluorescence (FL2) channel.Measuring Intracellular K ? Concentrations [K ? ] in by PBFI Flow Cytometry IL-2-activated human CD4? T cells were transiently transfected with GFP, Vpu/GFP, or KCNK3/GFP[16]. To assess their intracellular potassium concentrations, on day 1 post-transfection, the cells were incubated in 5 lM of K ? -specific fluorescent indicator PBFI-AM (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. The K d of PBFI were reported 5.1 mM in a Na ? -free milieu and 44 mM in a solution of 135 mM of Na ? and K ? in combine[39]. Thus, the changes of intracellular K ? concentrations can be reliably assessed by PBFI. For calibration, a portion of the PBFI-loaded cells were incubated with 2-4 lM valinomycin in balanced salt solutions containing different concentrations of K ? . On a FACSCalibur, the green fluorescent cells were gated at FL1, and their PBFI intensities were collected at the FL5 channel (excitation/emission: 350/500 nm)[40,41]. Membrane potentials were calculated with the measured [K ? ] in according to the Nernst equation.Characterization of Exovesicle Release by TMA-DPH StainingWe hypothesized that membrane potential depolarization may affect the budding efficiency of nonviral vesicles. Based on the Nernst equation, the negative cell membrane potential is largely resulted from the high concentration of K ? inside a cell ([K ? ] in ) and the relatively low extracellular concentration of K ? ([K ? ] out : about 4-8 mM for most tissues). Therefore, depolarization can be achieved by reducing the differences between [K ? ] in and [K ? ] out . Under a transmission electron microscope (TEM), the vesicles released from human CD4? T cells incubated in a high-K ? (73 mM K ? ) exhibited spherical shapes and sizes (44-172 nm in diameter;",
