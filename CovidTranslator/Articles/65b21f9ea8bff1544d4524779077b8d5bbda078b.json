The vector described here allows expression of a His-tagged protein of interest fused at its N-terminus to SUMO. Using this vector, we have produced a polypeptide consisting of SUMO fused to the Q-domain of Drosophila Groucho in a concentrated soluble form. Hydrodynamic analysis shows that, consistent with previous studies on full-length Groucho, the fusion protein forms an elongated tetramer, as well as higher order oligomers. After expressing a protein as a fusion to SUMO, it is often desirable to cleave the SUMO off of the fusion protein using a SUMO-specific protease such as Ulp1. To facilitate such processing, we have constructed a dual expression vector encoding two fusion proteins: one consisting of SUMO fused to Ulp1 and a second consisting of SUMO fused to a His-tagged protein of interest. The SUMO-Ulp1 cleaves both itself and the other SUMO fusion protein in the bacterial cells prior to lysis, and the proteins retain solubility after cleavage.",

SUMO modification appears to alter protein activity in a number of ways, for example, by influencing subcellular localization and non-covalent protein:protein interactions. SUMO appears to have a chaperone-like activity, preventing protein aggregation, although it is not clear if this is related to its biological functions. Because of the ability of SUMO to prevent aggregation, the translational fusion of SUMO to other proteins often results in significantly improved solubility of those proteins during expression in E. coli [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] .",

For example, sumoylated proteins such as Polycomb group proteins and promyelocytic leukemia protein have been found associated with dense protein bodies in the nucleus such as the PML oncogenic domains (PODs, also termed nuclear bodies) and Polycomb bodies [17, 18] .

One possibility is that the high solubility of SUMO itself counteracts the propensity of less soluble proteins to which it is attached to aggregate. However, if this were true, then we might expect cleavage of SUMO from these proteins during expression in E. coli to lead to aggregation. As we have shown here, cleavage of SUMO from either of two proteins (Ulp1 or Gro) during expression does not lead to aggregation. Therefore, we favor the notion that SUMO serves to prevent aggregation of proteins during their initial folding.",

The mechanism by which the Q domain forms multiple size oligomers is unknown, but one likely possibility is \"domain swapping\" [20] . In this process, one part of a protein:protein interaction motif (for example, one of the amphipathic \u03b1-helices in a Q domain coiled-coil motif) exchanges places with an identical domain from another subunit. This process can mediate the growth of oligomers of indefinite length. Further assessment of this model may be greatly facilitated by efforts to determine the atomic resolution structure of Q domain oligomers. analyzed by mass spectrometry after in-gel trypsinolysis. Tryptic fragments identified in each band are indicated next to the gel. The major species has an apparent molecular mass (32 kDa) that agrees well with the predicted molecular mass of the S-GroQ monomer (27 kDa), and the MS analysis confirms that this is the intact fusion protein. The slower migrating bands are likely to be SDS resistant oligomers. The fast migrating band appears to be a C-terminally truncated form of S-GroQ. The S-GroQ peptide sequence is shown below the gel: green lettering indicates SUMO sequence, blue lettering indicates Gro sequence, tryptic peptides (abcedf) identified by MS are boxed. Equilibrium sedimentation. Data were fit assuming A. A single species with a mass of 103,000 daltons, which approximately corresponds to a tetramer; B. a mixture of monomer and tetramer; or C. a mixture of monomer, tetramer, and 16-mer. Sedimentation equilibrium profiles depicted were measured at 8000 rpm. The lower plot in each panel depicts absorbance as a function of distance from the center of rotation. The upper plot in each panel depicts the deviation of the experimental data from the exponential fits. kilodaltons. The purity of this material is lower than that of the material shown in Figure 1 (and used in the analysis in Figures 2-4) , because these are small scale preps and the conditions were not fully optimized as they were for the prep shown in Figure 1 . a The molecular mass was calculated from M=6\u03c0\u03b7Nas/ (1-\u03bd\u03c1) where M is the molar mass, \u03b7 is the viscosity, N is Avogradro's number, a is the Stokes radius, s is the sedimentation coefficient, \u03bd\u0304 is the protein partial specific volume (0.722 ml/g), and \u03c1 is the density of the solvent (1.006 g/ ml) [21] .",
