The sialic acid glyco-epitope recognized by TER-119 on red blood cells was sensitive to the sialic acid O-acetyl esterase activity of the hemagglutinin esterase from bovine coronavirus but not to the corresponding enzyme from the influenza C virus. During erythrocyte development TER-119 + Ery-A and Ery-B cells could be stained by catalytically inactive bovine coronavirus hemaggutinin-esterase but not by the inactive influenza C hemagglutinin esterase, while TER-119 + Ery-C stage cells and mature erythrocytes were recognized by both virolectins. These results suggest that throughout murine erythrocyte development, cells of the erythroid lineage express a glycoconjugate bearing a modified 7,9-di-O-acetyl form of sialic acid, that is recognized specifically by the bovine coronavirus lectin and not by the influenza C hemagglutinin, and this modified sialic acid moiety is a component of the TER-119 epitope. As erythrocytes mature, the surface of Ery-C cells and mature erythrocytes also acquires a distinct CASD1dependent 9-O-acetyl sialic acid moiety that can be recognized by virolectins from both influenza C and bovine coronavirus that are specific for 9-O-acetyl sialic acid. esterases from Influenza C and bovine coronavirus, we demonstrate that the murine erythroid lineage-specific epitope recognized by the TER-119 monoclonal antibody is comprised of a 7,9-di-O-acetyl sialic acid glycoform that is completely lost in Casd1deficient mice. The 7,9-di-O-acetyl sialic acid glycoform can be detected early in erythroid differentiation from the Ery-A and Ery-B stages onward. We also observed that a distinct 9-O-acetyl sialic acid moiety also decorates cells of the erythroid lineage from the Ery C stage onward including in mature red blood cells.",

            "text": "Sialic acid, a monosaccharide with a nine-carbon backbone, is widely found in nature as a terminal sugar of animal and microbial glycoproteins and glycolipids. It plays important roles in animal development, cellular recognition processes and host-pathogen interactions (Schauer, 2009) . A common modification of sialic acid is 9-O-acetylation, which has been implicated in sialoglycan recognition and ganglioside biology. The hemagglutinins or hemagglutinin-esterases of type C influenza viruses and certain nidoviruses specifically recognize the 9-O-acetylated form of sialic acid, and this form of sialic acid is required for the entry of these viruses into human cells. Although we had previously inferred a role for sialic acid 9-O-acetylation in regulating Siglec-2 (Cariappa et al., 2009) , we have demonstrated that many of the phenotypes on the basis of which earlier conclusions were made, actually resulted from a mutation that was traceable to a commercially available C57BL/6 strain of mice (Mahajan et al., 2016) . , 2015) . Their studies implicated CASD1 in directly transferring acetyl moieties from acetyl-CoA to CMP-sialic acid. Whether CMP-sialic acid is the preferred substrate for the O-acetylation of sialic acid in vivo however remains to be established. In this report, we describe a mouse strain in which Casd1 has been deleted in the germline. Analysis of these mice demonstrated the loss of 9-O-acetylation of sialic acid on the surface of all hematopoietic cells examined. Based on the differential specificity of hemagglutinin O-acetylated sialic acid found on the surface of murine myeloid cells may decorate this glycoprotein. Indeed, mucin-like glycoproteins such as CD43 and CD45RB have been shown to bear 9-O-acetylated sialic acids on mononuclear cells in the spleen (Krishna and Varki, 1997) . No detectable 9-O-acetyl sialic acid was found on the CD11b + CD43 + population in the bone marrows of Casd1-deficient mice (Fig 1C) . A large proportion of CD43 + CD11bnon-myeloid cells, largely hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow, also express surface 9-O-acetyl sialic acid in wild type mice but this was completely lost in Casd1-deficient mice (Fig 1C) .",

However, the Ery-A and Ery-B erythroid precursors that normally express the TER-119 epitope in wild-type mice do not express any 9-O-acetyl sialic acid that is detectable by CHE-FcD staining. Therefore, we decided to examine the relationship between 9-O-acetyl sialic acid and the TER-119 epitope in greater detail. The hemagglutinin-esterase from bovine coronavirus Mebus strain (BHE) also recognizes 9-O-acetyl sialic acid, but in a manner that is structurally distinct from CHE (Zeng et al., 2008) . Furthermore, unlike CHE, the BHE lectin recognizes 7,9-di-O-acetyl sialic acid in addition to 9-O-acetyl sialic acid (Langereis et al., 2015; Bakkers et al., 2016) . Therefore, we expressed BHE as an Fcfusion protein (BHE-Fc) analogous to the approach used to generate CHE-Fc. In addition, we also generated a catalytically inactive form of BHE-Fc bearing the S40A substitution (BHE-Fc-S40A) whose ability to bind 9-O-acetyl sialic acids is unhindered as previously described (Zeng et al., 2008) . We found that the TER-119 + CD71 + Ery-A and Ery-B precursors from wild-type mice exhibited strong staining with BHE-Fc-S40A but not with CHE-FcD (Fig 3B and 4A) . This suggested to us that the TER-119 epitope may be recognized by the BHE virolectin but not by CHE. We next used murine RBCs to examine the interactions of the TER-119 epitope with CHE and BHE. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/469254 doi: bioRxiv preprint 4B). Yet, the TER-119 epitope on murine erythrocytes was surprisingly resistant to treatment with CHE ( Fig 4B) . As a control, and as previously shown by Varki et al., we also showed that CHE-Fc pre-treatment completely eliminated CHE-FcD binding on CD4 + T lymphocytes (Fig 2D) . Interestingly, the TER-119 epitope on murine RBCs was sensitive to BHE-Fc but not CHE-Fc esterase treatment (Fig 4B) . In contrast, pretreatment with an enzymatically inactive version of BHE-Fc bearing the S40A catalytic site mutation (BHE-S40A-Fc) had a negligible effect on TER-119 staining (data not shown).",

Given that both CHE and BHE have evolved as receptor-destroying enzymes that recognize 9-O-acetyl sialic acids, it was not surprising that both CHE-Fc and BHE-Fc pre-treatment of mouse RBCs was able to eliminate the corresponding virolectin receptor binding (Fig 4D) . Although treatment with BHE-Fc completely eliminated CHE-FcD binding, CHE only partially eliminated BHE-S40A-Fc binding (Fig 4D) . These data are consistent with the notion that the BHE virolectin and enzyme has the ability to recognize modified 9-O-acetyl sialic acid ligands that are not recognized by CHE. Since BHE has been shown to bind to 7,9-di-O-acetyl sialic acid while CHE cannot (Langereis et al., 2015; Bakkers et al., 2016) , our results support the notion that 7,9 di-O-acetyl sialic acid is a component of the TER-119 epitope and is expressed in the erythroid lineage from the Ery-A stage onwards.",

The analysis of the ligand-bound structures of BHE and CHE shows that although there is some structural homology between the two hemagglutinins, they bind the 9-O-acetyl sialic acid ligand in opposite orientations (Zeng et al., 2008) . Thus, it is theoretically possible that the conformation of the specific 9-O-acetyl sialic acid glycoform recognized by TER-119 is sterically constrained in the context of a particular glycan that favors binding and recognition by BHE over CHE. Although both BHE and CHE are lectins fused to receptor-destroying enzymes, it is particularly interesting that the esterase and hemagglutinin activities appear to have evolutionarily converged at the level of the specific glyco-conformations of 9-O-acetyl sialic acids. Thus study reveals an additional layer of complexity and diversity among the O-acetylated sialic acids and establishes the developmental regulation of the sequential acquisition of two different forms of 9-Oacetyl sialic acid during murine erythroid differentiation.",

Salvage of sialic acids from dietary sialogycans may serve as an additional source of sialic acid, but it remains unclear if the 9-O-acetyl moiety is preserved during this process. Our results suggest that CASD1 is necessary for the synthesis of 9-Oacetyl sialic acid at least in all hematopoietic cells.In mammals, O-acetylation of sialic acid has been observed at the 4, 7 and 9positions. In addition enzymatic activity corresponding to transferases and esterases capable of adding or removing these substitutions have been successfully enriched from subcellular fractions of tissues rich in O-acetylated sialic acids. Among these, CASD1 is the only mammalian enzyme that has been cloned and biochemically characterized; we have described the generation of a Casd1 knockout mouse in this study. However, our knowledge of the mammalian enzymes O-acetylating sialic acids remains incomplete and there has been a debate about the number of enzymes involved in generating the pool of 9-O-acetyl sialic acids in vivo. It remains to be established whether incorporation of 9-O-acetylated form of CMP-NANA into glycans is the only mechanism of generating 9-O-acetylated sialogycans. The complete loss of 9-O-acetyl sialic acids on the surface of erythroid, myeloid and CD4 T lineages suggests that at least in unmanipulated Casd1deficient mice, CASD1 may be the only enzyme capable of acetylating sialic acids in the 9-OH position on these cell types. Our results also suggest that CASD1 is required for the generation of 7,9-di-O-acetyl sialic acids in the murine erythroid lineage.",
