Methods: HRCT findings of 70 patients with presumed or laboratory-confirmed novel S-OIV infection were reviewed. The pattern (consolidation, ground glass, fibrosis and air trapping), distribution and extent of abnormality of the lesions on the HRCT were evaluated at different time points. To assess changes that occurred over time, the CT scans in 56 patients were examined in sequence. Results: The most common CT findings in patients with S-OIV infection are groundglass opacities with or without consolidation at the first week. The abnormalities peaked at the second week and resolved after that time, which resulted in substantial reduced residual disease at 4 weeks or later. The development of fibrosis was noted in the first week and peaked at the third week of illness (34.7%), then decreased slowly after that time. The mean time of air trapping being noted after the onset of symptoms was 55.5\u00a120.6 days. Comparing the findings of initial CT, most results (96.4%) of follow-up chest CT findings showed improvement (p,0.01). Conclusion: The abnormalities of ground-glass opacities and/or consolidation on initial CT scans tended to resolve to fibrosis, which then resolved completely or displayed substantially reduced residual disease. HRCT may show more changes in disease progression and play an important role in the evaluation of severe S-OIV.",

            "text": "A novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) was first reported in Mexico and became rampant globally later on in spring 2009 [1] . The World Health Organization declared the first Phase 6 global influenza pandemic of the century on 11 June 2009 [2] . During peak periods of influenza in autumn to winter of that year, a proportion of patients developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and some died of the disease. Serial chest radiography has been the main technique in the initial investigation of patients with suspected H1N1. However, multislice CT (MSCT) scanning is more sensitive than chest radiography, providing more detailed radiological features. Previous studies have reported that the predominant CT findings of disease were unilateral or bilateral multifocal peribronchovascular and/or subpleural ground-glass opacities (GGOs) with or without consolidation [1, 3] . Little is known, however, about sequential MSCT findings during the subsequent course of pneumonia with H1N1. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the radiological changes on serial thin-section chest CT scans in patients with H1N1 during the acute and convalescent periods of the illness.",

The 70 patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 29 critically ill patients. Critically ill patients were defined as (1) those admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) or those requiring mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive) and (2) those with a fraction of inspired oxygen (F I O 2 ) concentration greater than or equal to 60%. Group 2 consisted of 41 patients who required brief hospitalisation without advanced mechanical ventilation but were administered drugs.",

The protocol used was as follows: end-inspiratory acquisition, 120 kV, 150,200 mAs, and 2 mm reformation. The images were viewed on both lung (window width, 1400 HU; level, -700 HU) and mediastinal (window width, 350 HU; level, 40 HU) settings. The reconstructions were made at 2 mm slice thickness on lung settings.

The presence of parenchymal bands, irregular linear opacities, interfaces and traction bronchiectasis was considered evidence of probable fibrosis. GGOs were defined as hazy areas of increased opacity or attenuation without concealing the underlying vessels. Consolidation was defined as homogeneous opacification of the parenchyma with obscuration of the underlying vessels. Nodular opacities were defined as focal round opacities. Reticular opacities were defined as linear opacities forming a mesh-like pattern. Parenchymal bands were defined as non-tapering linear opacities a few millimetres thick and several centimetres long. Air trapping was defined as an area of low attenuation in contrast with the background attenuation of lung parenchyma on images obtained during expiration. The presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy (defined as a lymph node $1 cm in short-axis diameter), pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and pleural effusion was also noted.",

Observer variations were evaluated using the kappa coefficient for semi-categorical variables.

GGOs alone or with superimposed consolidation were predominant in the first week and decreased thereafter ( Figure 2 ; Table 1 ). At the first week after onset of symptoms, GGOs were noted in 95% (38/40) of patients and consolidation was noted in 57.5% (23/40) of patients. The most common pattern observed in initial CT scans was GGOs alone in Group 2 patients (51.2%; 21/41) and GGOs with superimposed consolidation in Group 1 patients (62.9%; 18/29), but the difference of their patterns was not significant between the groups (p.0.05). Smooth intralobular lines, reticular opacities, mild traction bronchiectasis, parenchymal bands, irregular linear opacities and interfaces, which suggested fibrosis, were noted in the first week after onset of symptoms and increased. By the second week, the greatest number of smooth intralobular lines and other superimposed reticular opacities were noted in association with GGOs ( Figure 2 ). Thickening of interlobular septa and intralobular lines in both sides can also be seen at the second week. The mean time of fibrosis being observed was 22.7\u00a115.8 days after the onset of symptoms. The sign of air trapping was only seen in nine patients who received prolonged ventilation and was not seen in patients who had never received ventilation or who had received ventilation for only a short time. Most of the air trapping was located in the ventral lung, which is normal before mechanical ventilation, and was observed after 4 weeks ( Figure 3 ). The mean time of air trapping noted after the onset of symptoms was 55.5\u00a120.6 days. However, further follow-up in these patients is required to determine whether these changes are reversible. 4 (5.5%) of the 70 patients developed pneumomediastinum that was only evident on high-resolution CT. 15 (21%) of the 70 patients had small bilateral or unilateral pleural effusions. Pleural effusions decreased gradually on follow-up CT. None had evidence of hilar or mediastinal lymph node enlargement on CT performed at admission or later.",

            "text": "H1N1 influenza is still a novel disease, with poorly understood pathology and pathogenesis. The histological changes of pneumonia in H1N1 are characteristic of influenza, though not pathognomonic. Autopsies have shown that the main pathological changes associated with S-OIV infection are localised to the lungs [10] . The lungs typically show focal to extensive diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) [11, 12] . In the early exudative inflammatory phase of the disease (,10-12 days), DAD is predominant. The early or exudative stage is characterised by pulmonary oedema with hyaline membranes, alveolar septal oedema, fibrin thrombus in the vascular lumen and acute pulmonary haemorrhage, which contribute to some typical radiological manifestations such as GGOs and consolidations [12] . Initial CT scans in this study showed bilateral multifocal asymmetric GGOs and consolidation distributed predominantly in subpleural and peribronchovascular areas, corroborating previous preliminary reports [13, 14] . Characterisation of GGOs and consolidations are generally pathologically attributable to the partial displacement of air from partial filling of air spaces, thickening of interstitial tissues from fluid or cells, partial alveolar collapse, or increased capillary blood volume [15, 16] . The following additional histopathological features have also been reported: pneumonia foci with intra-alveolar exudates without evidence of bacterial colonies [11] ; moderate to marked inflammation of the submucosal glands and ducts with focal epithelial cytonecrosis; tracheitis and bronchitis, focal squamous metaplasia, and submucosal inflammatory infiltrates [12] ; pleuritis; interstitial pneumonitis; cytopathic effect in the bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells; and epithelial hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia of the large airways [12] .",

            "text": "The intermediate stage begins in the second week and is a transitional period during which oedematous fluid is reabsorbed and proliferative processes begin. In cases with longer disease duration, changes consistent with the fibrous proliferative phase (organising diffuse alveolar damage) and the final fibrotic stage (interstitial fibrosis) have been observed. Fibrous processes begin to appear from the second week and are visible by CT at this stage of ARDS [17] . These processes are manifested radiologically by the appearance of architectural distortions (i.e. irregular interfaces and traction bronchiectasis), a reticular pattern (with septal thickening and parenchymal bands) and subpleural cysts [18] . In the present study, the mean time of fibrosis observed was 22.7\u00a115.8 days after the onset of symptoms. More signs of probable fibrosis may become apparent at CT in this study as the consolidation resolves with time. Fibrosis may appear earlier with a prompt treatment after onset of symptoms. It is difficult to know how many of these structural changes will resolve over time. Further follow-up of these patients would be helpful to understand the evolving process. It is believed that pulmonary fibrosis observed at the recovery phase would, at least in part, account for the respiratory symptoms [19] . As the underlying histopathological features of H1N1 influenza are not unique, it may be difficult to distinguish diffuse alveolar damage caused by H1N1 infections from that caused by other micro-organisms, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or avian influenza A (H5N1) [10] . Common features of thin-section CT scan could be found in patients with H1N1, SARS or organising pneumonia [20, 21] , particularly during the initial phase of the illness when the GGOs and consolidation are primarily subpleural. Similarly, the presence of smooth interlobular septal thickening superimposed on extensive GGOs can be seen in conditions such as pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, pulmonary oedema and with other types of bacterial or viral pneumonia, such as SARS [22, 23] .",

However, 18% of the patients showed pleural effusion, which is different from SARS. Radiological recovery from H1N1 can be complete, but CT images often show persistent GGO and reticular opacities, some of which reflect pathological findings of fibrosis. Long-term follow-up imaging of survivors shows gradual decrease of GGO and reticulation, with persistent air trapping in some patients. The latter is evidence of small airway disease that cannot be detected on CT scans at the onset of the disease [26] . CT findings manifest as extensive bilateral airspace disease in patients requiring long-term pressure-control mechanical ventilation [28] . Air trapping observed at thin-section CT in our patients was similar to those observed in the late stage of ARDS [29] . Air trapping seen in the present study was not seen in the early stage of the disease or in the patients who did not receive mechanical ventilation, but only in ICU patients with long-term mechanical ventilation, and most of them were seen in the ventral lung [30, 31] . When patients with ARDS receive mechanical ventilation with positive pressure, poorly aerated lobules may be recruited and previously normal aerated regions may become overinflated [18] . It has always been assumed that the changes seen in patients receiving positive pressure ventilation represent a combination of the effects of the primary disease that causes inflammatory changes in the lung parenchyma in addition to the damage caused by prolonged positive-pressure ventilation itself [32] . This suggests that air trapping may be a result of ARDS or a consequence of patients who received long-term mechanical ventilation rather than the inflammatory process. 54 of 56 patients (96.4%) showed improvement in lung fibrotic changes 1 month later. This suggests that the mechanism of lung injury and lung fibrotic changes caused by H1N1 might have a different pathophysiological process compared with other diseases of the lung. H1N1 patients with lung fibrotic changes seem to have the ability for self-rehabilitation, which is similar to SARS cases [33] .",

Although GGO and interstitial opacity resolve over time, air trapping persists. HRCT may show more changes of parenchymal disease compared with radiographs. Long-term follow-up with thin-section CT and concomitant functional studies are required to determine the long-term pulmonary sequelae of S-OIV. Figure 5 . Line graph shows median thin-section CT scores at various time points in weeks after onset of symptoms. Graph shows median thin-section CT scores plotted against mean time for each week for patients admitted to the intensive care unit and those who required brief hospitalisation without advanced mechanical ventilation. The rate of radiographic progression (slope of each curve) for the two groups is roughly parallel over the weeks. There was a marked increase in extent of disease during the second week of illness, and the estimate marginal means of CT score peaked at week 2 of illness in both groups, with a slow decline thereafter.",
