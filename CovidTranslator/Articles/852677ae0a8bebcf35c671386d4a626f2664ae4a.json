To establish a highthroughput screening protocol for the simultaneous identification of pathogen-and host-targeted hit candidates against either or both pathogens, we have attempted coinfection of cells with IAV and RSV. However, viral replication kinetics were incompatible, RSV signal window was low, and an IAV-driven minireplicon reporter assay used in initial screens narrowed the host cell range and restricted to single-cycle infections. To overcome these limitations, we developed an RSV strain carrying firefly luciferase fused to an innovative universal small-molecule assisted shut-off domain, which boosted assay signal window, and a hyperactive fusion protein that synchronized IAV and RSV reporter expression kinetics and suppresses the identification of RSV entry inhibitors sensitive to a recently reported RSV pan-resistance mechanism. Combined with a replication-competent recombinant IAV strain harboring nano-luciferase, the assay performed well on a human respiratory cell line and supports multi-cycle infections. Miniaturized to 384-well format, the protocol was validated through screening of a set of the NIH Clinical Collection (NCC) in quadruplicate. These test screens demonstrated favorable assay parameters and reproducibility. Application to a LOPAC library of bioactive compounds in a proof-of-concept campaign detected licensed anti-myxovirus therapeutics, ribavirin and the neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir, and identified two unexpected RSV-specific hit candidates, Fenretinide and the opioid receptor antagonist BNTX-7. Hits were evaluated in direct and orthogonal dose-response counterscreens using a standard recRSV reporter strain expressing renilla luciferase.",

In the case of RSV, however, several studies have challenged the paradigm that RSV pathogenesis is the result of host immunopathology alone. Higher viral loads were identified as a prediction of severe lower respiratory RSV infection in infants 9 and RSV load on day three after hospitalization was associated with a requirement for intensive care and respiratory failure in children less than two years old 10 . These observations suggest that efficacious therapeutics given early to hospitalized children may improve downstream morbidity and reduce immunopathology, opening an opportunity for improved disease management. While RSV elicits innate and adaptive immune responses, the virus is poorly immunogenic overall and neutralizing antibody titers wane quickly post infection 5 , making vaccine development challenging despite extensive research. Immunoprophylaxis with the neutralizing antibody palivizumab is reserved for high-risk patients due to prohibitive costs 11 and ribavirin, although approved for RSV treatment, has little clinical benefit due to efficacy and toxicity issues 12 .",

In search of a resource-effective approach that simultaneously interrogates the full host-pathogen interactome for both pathogen-directed and host-directed hit candidates in a single well setting, we have recently described a dual myxovirus pathogen high throughput screening (HTS) assay 32 . Based on the hypothesis that the anticipated broadened indication spectrum of host-directed antivirals itself can be employed as the selector for hit candidates, we combined in this first implementation of the strategy an IAV isolate driving a firefly luciferase minigenome reporter with a recombinant MeV reporter strain expressing renilla luciferase. MeV, a paramyxovirus, was chosen as a replacement for RSV, since we found that fast IAV and slow RSV reporter expression kinetics were incompatible 32 . We demonstrated that ortho-and paramyxoviruses efficiently co-replicate, thus allowing the automated identification of orthomyxovirus-specific, paramyxovirus-specific, and broad-spectrum drug candidates in a robust assay format. Implementation of this dual-pathogen protocol in a proof-of-concept screen identified, amongst others, the pan-myxovirus blocker compound 09167, which acts by stimulating the expression of effector genes of host antiviral pathways 32 .",

It was therefore the goal of the present study to develop and implement in a feasibility screen innovative myxovirus reporter strains that overcome these limitations and support direct drug screens with replication-competent IAV and RSV reporter strains in a robust HTS campaign.",

The resulting recIAV-WSN Gaussia showed efficient replication and reporter expression in the absence of exogenous trypsin (figure 1B). However, the signal window of Gaussia remained below 10 (figure 1C). Towards extending the assay range, we substituted Gaussia luciferase for the recently developed Nano luciferase (NanoLuc, figure 1A) , which uses the same basic substrate chemistry as Gaussia and Renilla luciferases but combines a small protein size with high signal intensities. Recovered recIAV-WSN NanoLuc indeed returned an over six-fold improved signal window and showed superior absolute luciferase signal intensities compared to recIAV-WSN Gaussia (figures 1C and D). Z' values in either case far exceeded 0.5, suggesting that the assay is suitable for automation. Serial passaging of this recombinant confirmed equivalent genetic stability of recIAV-WSN Gaussia and recIAV-WSN NanoLuc. By comparison, luciferase activity rapidly disappeared when a recIAV-WSN NS-Gaussia was subjected to passaging, which harbors the luciferase open reading frame in the NS genome segment (figure 1E).

When comparing RSV and MeV in cell culture, most notably is the divergence in cell-to-cell fusion (syncytia formation) after infection, which represents the hallmark of MeV cytopathicity but is much less pronounced in the case of RSV. We therefore hypothesized that the lower rate of lateral RSV spread may cause the slower reporter expression kinetics, and asked whether a hyperfusogenic RSV variant would alleviate the problem. We have previously generated an RSV recombinant with a D to E substitution of fusion (F) protein residue 489 that renders it hyperfusogenic 45 .",

Independent of the nature of the luciferase reporter included, time to peak reporter activity of F D489E mutant strains was less than half that of a strain harboring standard F ( figure 2B) . These results suggest that the hyperfusogenic recRSV-L19F D489E -firefly strain should be suitable for co-infection screens with recIAV WSN-NanoLuc. When attempting to purify recRSV-L19F D489E -firefly preparations from contaminating firefly protein that was synthesized during stock growth, however, we noted that both gradient ultracentrifugation and layered bead chromatography purification strategies successfully reduced renilla luciferase contaminations, but by comparison remained inefficient against firefly luciferase (figure 2C). As a consequence, the signal window of assays based on the recRSV-L19F D489E -firefly strain was approximately 8-fold lower than that achievable with recRSV-L19F D489E -renilla (figure 2D), excluding its use in high-density HTS applications.",

Added as a genetic tag, SMASh consists of a hepatitis C virus-derived NS3 protease flanked by a strong degron domain inducing proteasomal degradation. An NS3 protease site is positioned at the intersection of the SMASh tag and the target protein ( figure 3A) . Under normal conditions, NS3 autoproteolysis separates the tag, returning the near-native target protein.

Two explanations for the variation in purification success are conceivable; firefly but not renilla luciferase may nonspecifically absorb to RSV particles, or firefly luciferase may be incorporated efficiently into budding RSV virions. Either scenario would render the protein inaccessible to purification strategies designed to preserve the infectivity of the virus stock.",

These features make the technology uniquely suitable for applications in recombinant virions and allow, for instance, a controlled shut-off of virus replication in vitro and in vivo 39 .

Fenretinide is a synthetic retinoid derivative that was developed with anti-cancer and anticystic fibrosis endpoints 60 . The compound also suppresses HIV infection, which was originally attributed to enhanced viral endocytosis 61 . However, a recent study demonstrating strong anti-Dengue virus activity suggested upregulation of the host cell unfolded protein response pathway as an alternative mechanism of activity 62 . BNTX-7 is a selective opioid delta receptor antagonist 63 . Highly differential activity against RSV and IAV in our dose-response counterscreens excludes high cytotoxicity as the underlying cause of RSV inhibition, and comparable potency against both RSV A2-L19F-renilla and RSV A2-L19F D489E -fireSMASh with distinct reporter technology argues against reporter interference. Opioid receptors are present on epithelial cells of the oral/respiratory tract 64 . Remarkably, altered opioid receptor signaling was found to correlate with disease severity in human RSV infection and a mouse model 65 , underscoring that a mechanistic evaluation of the role of opioid receptor signaling in RSV replication may uncover novel druggable targets. An assessment of the broader paramyxovirus indication spectrum of Fenretinide and BNTX-7 and a characterization of the underlying mechanism for selective RSV inhibition are currently underway.",

Having generated a diverse panel of myxovirus reporter strains harboring distinct luciferases 32 , we demonstrate the feasibility of a rapid automated counterscreening strategy that examines hit candidate activity against a luciferase reporter with distinct substrate chemistry. In the case of recRSV A2-L19F D489E -fireSMASh, this approach also addresses any NS3 protease liability, since the fireSMASh was replaced by recRSV A2-L19F D489E -renilla.

Values were normalized (norm.) for vehicle (DMSO)-treated infections and represent mean % inhibition or % cell viability (viab.) of three replicates \u00b1 SD. Regressions curves for antiviral (black) or cytotoxic (grey) activities are based on four-parameter modeling where applicable. Overview of the replication-competent IAV and RSV reporter strain-based next-generation dual pathogen HTS protocol for the simultaneous identification of IAV-specific, RSVspecific, and broad spectrum inhibitors. The assay is validated for human respiratory BEAS-2B cells, but adaptable to all cell lines that are permissive for either virus strain. Infection at high MOI will predominantly identify inhibitors of viral entry and polymerase, while low MOI multi-cycle infections allow interrogation of all stages of the viral live cycle. Counterscreens are required to distinguish between hit candidates or reporter interfering compounds (specific antiviral activity), and hit candidates, reporter interfering compounds, cytotoxic compounds, or promiscuous pan-assay interfering (PAIN) compounds (broad spectrum activity).

A549 cells were exposed at infection to the potent inhibitor 5-iodotubercidin 85 at 10 \u03bcM or the vehicle (DMSO) volume equivalent. RLUs were determined 48 hours postinfection. Values were normalized for vehicle controls (N = 3; means \u00b1 SD are shown); numbers above the columns show raw data means \u00b1 SD. Z' and S/B values are specified below the graph. D) Reporter expression profiles of recIAV WSN-NanoLuc as in (B) after infection of A549 cells at two different MOIs (N = 3; means \u00b1 SD are shown). Instrument gain 135 for recIAV WSN-NanoLuc. The IAV WSN-Gaussia profile was added for comparison. E) recIAV WSN-NanoLuc and WSN-Gaussia are genetically stable over several passages.
