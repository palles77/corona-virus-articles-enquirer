An autoregressive moving average model together with an exogenous variables (ARMAX) model are used to estimate the effects of these diseases in each SARS-and Avian Flu-infected country, while a dynamic panel model is adopted to estimate the overall impact on the region of these two diseases. The empirical results from both approaches are consistent and indicate that the numbers of affected cases have a significant impact on SARS-affected countries but not on Avian Flu-affected countries. However, since the potential damage arising from the Avian Flu and subsequent pandemic influenza is much greater than that resulting from the SARS, the need to take the necessary precautions in the event of an outbreak of Avian Flu and pandemic influenza warrants further attention and action. Therefore, the empirical findings of this study could add to the knowledge regarding the relationship between tourism and crisis management, especially in so far as the management of transmissible diseases is concerned. r",

Page, Yeoman, Munro, Connell, and Walker (2006) pointed out that the recent disasters or crises including 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina in the US, the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in the UK, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in the Asian countries, and the devastation caused by the Indian Ocean tsunami had a huge adverse impact on international tourism. For example, following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the number of international arrivals in Phuket, Thailand's second international gateway, dropped by 67.2% in the first half of 2005, and an estimated 500 tourism companies, employing more than 3000 people, collapsed during these months with predictions of further job losses (Henderson, 2007) . Wilder-Smith (2006) noted that there was a drop of 12 million arrivals in Asian and Pacific countries following the outbreak of the Avian Flu epidemic. The World Travel and Tourism Council (2003) estimated that approximately 3 million people in the tourism industry lost their jobs following the outbreak of SARS in the most severely affected countries of China, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore, which resulted in losses of over $20 billion in terms of GDP.",

Since this Avian Flu is still in its relatively early stages, its impact on tourism has so far been relatively moderate. Nonetheless, it is in our interests to estimate its impact on the tourism sector and to compare it to other crisis/disaster level diseases, such as SARS, so that people can learn from these former outbreaks and be well prepared to limit such a deadly disease's potential damage.",

Faulkner defines a crisis as an event which disrupts an organization's (or destination's) functioning, and of which a large part of its effects can be prevented or reduced by human efforts. On the other hand, a ''disaster'' has been used to refer to the situation where a destination is confronted with unpredictable catastrophic change over which it has little control. In this sense, the current Avian Flu epidemic is more of a crisis than a disaster. Meanwhile, the classification and analysis of crises highlights the importance of comparing the post-crisis analysis with the pre-crisis analysis (e.g., Beirman, 2003; Ritchie, 2004; GlaeXer, 2005) . Comparing the post-crisis analysis of SARS with the pre-crisis analysis of Avian Flu can form a strategic framework that will combat the transmissable diseases. Meanwhile, Page et al. (2006) pointed out the global spread of Avian Flu was taking place at such a speed that its geographical distribution was changing weekly and that the simulated data in their paper would certainly be overtaken. Thus, this paper follows the suggestion by Page et al. (2006) that updated data be used to analyze Avian Flu.",

Meanwhile, about 200 cases of humans who have been infected by Avian Flu have been confirmed, and the mortality rate of 59% (WHO, 2006) has been high. Avian Flu has a potential global reach in that it can spread through international travel, but a short-to medium-term slowdown could result in the shutdown of the tourism sector (Page et al., 2006) . Thus, international tourism will be seriously affected or even restricted to prevent the spread of Avian Flu and pandemic influenza. Brahmbhatt (2005) estimates that the 2004 Avian Flu outbreak in Vietnam led to a 1.8% decline in GDP, where a 5% decline in tourist arrivals could lead to a 0.4% decline in GDP. Furthermore, the World Bank estimated that the global economic influence of an outbreak of Avian Flu could be US $800 billion, equal to 2% of world economic output (Brahmbhatt, 2005) .",

            "text": "To estimate the impacts of two infectious diseases, SARS and Avian Flu, on tourism demand in Asia's most affected countries, two important methodologies are adopted in this study. First, we estimate the effects by implementing an autoregressive moving average model with exogenous variable (ARMAX) procedures involving a single dataset, which includes performing unit root tests for dependent and independent variables, constructing the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models for dependent variables, and finally estimating the potential impacts by using the ARMAX models. An ARMAX model includes dynamic autoregressive and moving components in addition to theoretical explanatory variables to explain variations in endogenous variables. Bierens (1987) developed estimation and testing methodology for such a model. In the field of tourism, numerous studies have applied the models to estimate the impacts of terrorism on tourism and forecast tourism revenues. For example, Enders, Sandler, and Parise (1992) and Sloboda (2003) utilized ARMAX models to assess the effects of terrorism on tourism for various European nations and the USA. Akal (2004) found the cause-effect relationship between international tourist arrivals and tourism revenues and forecasted the future values of revenues by using ARMAX models. In order to estimate the impacts of epidemic diseases including SARS and Avian Flu on tourism demand in most Asian affected countries, the methodology of the ARMAX model is adopted in our study.",

Globally, the outbreak of SARS has claimed around 774 lives out of 8096 infected cases from 27 countries/areas, mostly in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore (WHO, 2004) . In order to limit the spread of infection by international travel, WHO has advised the postponement of nonessential travel to SARS-affected areas. Asian tourism, which has mostly involved infected areas, has thus been badly affected since the outbreak of SARS in 2003. Table 1 lists the numbers of cases and deaths from SARS by country, while Table 2 lists the  numbers of confirmed human cases of Avian Flu for each  country and time period. SARS or Avian Flu can damage destination marketing, a finding that is emphasized by Buhalis (2000) and Mohsin (2005) . These diseases can reduce the competitiveness of affected countries and thus give rise to a reduction in international arrivals. Page et al. (2006) pointed out that Avian Flu would cause severe shocks to tourism and a much deeper crisis of confidence in regard to travel than infectious illnesses such as SARS. Furthermore, Avian Flu might result in a high mortality rate among humans as a result of the disease being transmitted from animals to humans, but not by close person to person contact. Therefore, the travel advisories and restrictions can be much more serious for Avian Flu once it becomes easily transmitted between humans.",

Gar\u0131\u00b4n-Mun\u02dcoz and Pe\u00b4rez-Amaral (2000) indicated that international tourism demand is usually measured by proxies such as the volume of earnings generated by foreign visitors, the number of nights spent by visitors from abroad, and the number of foreign visitors. Because people face the potential danger of being infected by SARS and Avian Flu through international travel, travelers might limit nonessential travel to affected countries. Thus, we use the number of foreign visitors, namely the number of international tourist arrivals, to estimate the impacts of the two diseases on international tourism demand. The monthly data for international tourist arrivals are collected from statistical datasets for each country, and the probable numbers of SARS-infected patients and the confirmed human cases of Avian Flu are obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO, 2006 Furthermore, the ARMA and ARMAX models are estimated by using nonlinear least squares estimators, while dynamic panel models are implemented by using the panel GMM technique. Seasonality is a widely known aspect of tourism time series data (Lim and McAleer, 2001) , which might lead to spurious and biased results. In order to better reveal certain non-seasonal features, seasonal adjustment is the process of estimating and removing seasonal effects from a time series. Lim and McAleer (2001) noted that the conventional and frequently-used technique for smoothing time series data is the moving average method. Hence, before estimating the effects of SARS and Avian Flu on tourism demand, the EViews software package is used to implement the process of seasonal adjustment for the tourist arrivals series in order to remove the seasonal effects by means of the multiplicative moving average method. The seasonally adjusted series for international tourism demand is then obtained to process the ARMAX models and dynamic panel data models.",

An ARMAX model includes dynamic autoregressive and moving average components in addition to theoretical explanatory variables to explain variations in endogenous variables. An ARMAX model is an ARMA model for an endogenous dependent variable with additional exogenous independent variables (X). Greene (2000, p. 764) pointed out that the ARMA model is a specific case of ARMAX without explanatory variables, while Harvey (1990) and Franses (1991) considered the ARMAX problems to be an extension of ARMA model because the disturbances are generated by an ARMA process. Therefore, the ARMA model needs to be identified before constructing the ARMAX model. Furthermore, Akal (2004) indicated that the ARMAX model corrects for the shortcomings of the econometric cause-effect technique by using dynamic filters to explain the variations in dependent variables. An explanatory part is integral to the ARMA process in constructing the ARMAX model. The general ARMAX model (Bierens, 1987) can be written as:",

Therefore, MacKinnon critical values have been used to conduct the ADF test of the hypothesis of a unit root, r \u00bc 0. In this study, the model for the tourism demand series is set with a time effect, but the ADF regression for the other two series, namely, the probable SARS-infected patients and the number of confirmed cases of Avian Flu, are modeled without a time effect. Secondly, before incorporating the explanatory part to construct the ARMAX model, we must identify a suitable ARMA model for the dependent variable (Franses, 1991) . Various procedures are fitted to determine the appropriate lag length of the dependent variables, i.e., the monthly international arrivals series for each country, in order to conduct suitable ARMA processes. A suitable model is generally preferred since it fits the data without including unnecessary variables. The two most commonly used criteria for model selection are Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and Schwartz's Bayesian Criterion (SBC), with the decision to base the model choice being to select the model for which the appreciate criterion is the smallest.",

The estimated initial ARMAX model can be used to test the hypotheses by imposing restrictions on the estimated parameters, and to evaluate the simplified model again. In our study, the simplification of the initial model is based on two criteria, the Wald test statistic for the null hypothesis where some parameters equal zero simultaneously, and R 2 .

In addition, the utilization of this type of data enables us to have a relatively large number of observations and a consequent increase in degrees of freedom, hence reducing collinearity and improving the efficiency of the estimates (Song & Witt, 2000) .

In this study, we start with an over-parameterized model according to maximum lengths of the AR and MA terms to get an initial ARMAX model. The results of the initial ARMAX model are presented in Appendix B. Table 5 shows the results of the simplified ARMAX model for estimating the impacts of SARS on tourism demand, namely, the estimation results of SARS on the tourism demand for China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. The estimated coefficients for probable SARSinfected cases (S it , S i(t\u00c01) , S i(t\u00c02) , S i(t\u00c03) ) could be interpreted as the impacts of each SARS-infected patient on tourism demand if only distributed lags are included in the ARMAX model. For instance, the estimated results from Table 5 show that the impacts of probable SARSinfected cases on tourism demand for the current and next periods in Singapore will be significantly reduced by 798 and 1742 arrivals, respectively. However, the coefficients that determine the impacts on each period would be calculated on the basis of the quotient of polynomials formed by the distributed lags and by the AR polynomial lags if both the distributed lags and AR terms are included in the ARMAX models. The coefficients that determine the impacts of each period for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are shown in Table 6 . As for the impacts of probable SARS-infected patients on the tourism demand in China, we found that the change in tourism demand was reduced by 299 persons as one person became infected by SARS in the current period (or month) while in the next period the tourism demand was reduced by 355 arrivals. However, the estimation results for Hong Kong show that the impact of probable SARS-infected patients was that the tourism demand was reduced by 149 arrivals as one more person became infected with SARS in the current month. Finally, the estimation results for the impact of probable SARS-infected patients on the tourism demand in Taiwan are shown in the last column of Table 6 . In Taiwan, if one more person were to be infected by SARS in the current period, there would be reductions in the tourism demand in the current and the next period of about 175 and 57 arrivals, respectively. The estimation results in Table 6 indicate that the time period for the impacts of SARS on tourism demand in Asian countries extends for about 2 months which implies that the impact of SARS on tourism demand constitutes a short-term shock.",

The results of dynamic panel models for panel datasets are consistent with the ARMAX models for single datasets so that the numbers of affected cases have significant impacts for SARS-infected countries but not for Avian Flu-affected countries. In addition, the estimated results from the single data model show that the impact of each SARS-infected person on tourism demand in these Asian countries ranged from 175 to 1742, while the average impact of regional tourism on SARS-infected countries was reduced by about 403 arrivals based on the dynamic panel model.

Meanwhile, clarity and sharing correct information are crucial to controlling an outbreak of either SARS or Avian Flu, both in regard to the health perspective and the travel perspective as stated by Cheng (2006) . This study helps to clarify the potential situation of Avian Flu if it were to develop into a human-to-human influenza pandemic.",

Taiwan was one of the countries most seriously affected by the 2003 SARS epidemic (Liu, Hammitt, Wang, & Tsou, 2005) . The Taiwan government has now learned from its experiences of SARS and is setting aside at least a US $0.65 billion budget to protect the Taiwanese people against this Avian Flu and pandemic influenza. It is also expected that Taiwan will have less in terms of loss should such a transmissible disease strike because its preparedness for a single disease can benefit its preparedness for all diseases. However, such preparedness involves relying on knowing the reaction of international travelers to the Avian Flu as shown in this study. Ritchie (2004) pointed out that decisions taken before a crisis occurs will give rise to more effective management during a crisis, which is in the spirit of pre-crisis planning. Furthermore, Page et al. (2006) suggested that the current national tourism management authorities should formulate appropriate response strategies, so that each destination could prepare for any outbreak without adversely damaging its image as a place to visit. This study provides timely information regarding an upcoming huge and fatal crisis, and can thus serve as part of the knowledge base in the precrisis planning.",

            "text": "The major purpose of this paper has been to estimate the impacts of SARS and Avian Flu on international tourism. The estimation results provide useful insights into how epidemic and pandemic diseases affect international tourism. Song and Witt (2000) pointed out that the static regressions of tourism demand models might emerge numerous problems, such as structural instability, forecasting failures and spurious regression. In addition, Gar\u0131\u00b4n-Mun\u02dcoz (2007) indicates if the impact of the previous tourism was neglected, the effect of the other variables considered will tend to be overestimated. So the dynamic structure of consumer preference must be deliberated in the tourism demand model (Gar\u0131\u00b4n-Mun\u02dcoz, 2006) . One way to handle the dynamic structure of preferences is to consider taste change as endogenous by including previous tourism demand ( Gar\u0131\u00b4n-Mun\u02dcoz, 2006; Gar\u0131\u00b4n-Mun\u02dcoz & Pe\u00b4rez-Amaral, 2000; Ledesma-Rodr\u0131\u00b4guez et al., 2001) . Therefore, for a specific country, ARMAX model including dynamic autoregressive and moving components was appropriate as a technique to provide the assessment of the effects of infectious disease on international tourism. Furthermore, dynamic panel models were implemented to estimate the whole regional tourism impacts of SARS and Avian Flu on infected countries. In this paper, the results of ARMAX models were reported the country-specific effects whereas the regionspecific effect, that is the average damage of Asian affected countries, was found by using dynamic panel data models. Firstly, the significant damage on international tourism demand by using ARMAX procedures were found from single datasets in SARS-affected countries, but not in Avian Flu-infected countries. The negative impacts of SARS on country-specific international tourism range from 175 to 1742 as one more person infected by SARS. The different damage levels for these four SARS affected country might depend upon the government's suppression and reaction strategies. Secondly, Asian tourism demand was significantly reduced by about 403 arrivals for an additional person probably infected by SARS. The figure indicates that the average damage level of Asian SARS affected countries is around 403. However, the estimated results of dynamic panel data models shows that Asian tourism demand is not significantly affected by the infectious illness of Avian Flu.",
