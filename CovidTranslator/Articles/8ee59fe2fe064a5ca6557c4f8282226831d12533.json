In this study, 829 serum specimens were collected from 643 patients initially reported to be infected with SARS-CoV. The sera were tested for the N protein of SARS-CoV by using an antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on monoclonal antibodies against the N protein of SARS-CoV and compared to 197 control serum samples from healthy donors and non-SARS febrile patients. The results of the N protein detection analysis were directly related to the serological analysis data. From 27 SARS patients who tested positive with the neutralization test, 100% of the 24 sera collected from 1 to 10 days after the onset of symptoms were positive for the N protein. N protein was not detected beyond day 11 in this group. The positive rates of N protein for sera collected at 1 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, and 16 to 20 days after the onset of symptoms for 414 samples from 298 serologically confirmed patients were 92.9, 69.8, 36.4, and 21.1%, respectively. For 294 sera from 248 serological test-negative patients, the rates were 25.6, 16.7, 9.3, and 0%, respectively. The N protein was not detected in 66 patients with cases of what was initially suspected to be SARS but serologically proven to be negative for SARS and in 197 serum samples from healthy donors and non-SARS febrile patients. The specificity of the assay was 100%. Furthermore, of 16 sera collected from four patients during the SARS recurrence in Guangzhou, 5 sera collected from 7 to 9 days after the onset of symptoms were positive for the N protein. N protein detection exhibited a high positive rate, 96 to 100%, between day 3 and day 5 after the onset of symptoms for 27 neutralization test-positive SARS patients and 298 serologically confirmed patients. The N protein detection rate continually decreased beginning with day 10, and N protein was not detected beyond day 19 after the onset of symptoms. In conclusion, an antigen capture ELISA reveals a high N protein detection rate in acute-phase sera of patients with SARS, which makes it useful for early diagnosis of SARS.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease of significant public health concern. Due to the recurrence of SARS in Guangzhou and Beijing, China, we would like to stress the tremendous importance of sensitive, easy, and reliable early diagnosis of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection. The three major diagnostic methods currently available are (i) viral RNA detection using real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (8, 15, 20) , (ii) antibody detection using indirect immunofluorescence assay (2) , or (iii) using both the recombinant N protein and culture extracts of SARS-CoV-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (10, 16, 19) . Although RT-PCR is a useful assay during the early phase of SARS-CoV infection with regard to sensitivity, it relies heavily on experienced technicians and specialized laboratory equipment and sometimes provides false-positive results due to contamination. Serological tests, however, do not provide early diagnosis, since the median time to seroconversion in patients with SARS is 17 to 20 days after the onset of symptoms (14) . Since SARS-CoV appears in the blood much earlier than the antibodies (21) , the identification of SARS-CoV antigen in sera may provide a possible method for early diagnosis of SARS. Since the nucleocapsid (N) proteins of known coronaviruses are relatively conserved, immunogenic, and abundantly expressed during infection (6, 9) , we tried to determine whether the N protein is a potential early diagnostic marker for SARS. Recently, we reported the development of an antigen-capture ELISA based on monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the N protein of SARS-CoV (4) . High levels of circulating N protein can be detected in the sera of patients with SARS (3) . In this study, we further evaluate its early diagnostic value by using a large number of clinical samples collected between 2 February and 5 May 2003, during the SARS epidemic in Guangzhou, People's Republic of China. The serum specimens from the recurrence of SARS in Guangzhou are also analyzed (12) . A total of 829 serum specimens were collected at 1 to 115  days after the onset of symptoms from 643 patients who were reported to have  probable or suspicious symptoms of SARS between 2 February and 5 May 2003 during the SARS epidemic in Guangzhou. Of these patients, 204 had paired serum specimens available for serologic analysis, in which the acute-phase serum specimens were collected at day 1 to day 15 and the convalescent-phase serum specimens were subsequently obtained at day 28 or longer after the onset of illness. Sixteen serum specimens were collected from four patients during the recurrence of SARS in Guangzhou from 22 December 2003 to 30 January 2004. Another 197 serum specimens were used as controls. Of these samples, 30 sera were identified as positive for the influenza immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody at a fourfold increase in antibody titer, 35 sera were identified as positive for the dengue IgM antibody, 32 sera were identified as positive for the measles IgM antibody, and 100 sera were from healthy blood donors. All of the serum specimens were stored at \u03ea20\u00b0C until tested.",

Cloning and purification of the glutathione S-transferase-nucleocapsid fusion protein and development of monoclonal antibodies specific to the N protein of SARS-CoV have been reported previously (5) . Evaluation of the MAb-based ELISA for detection of the N protein of SARS-CoV in sera and viral cell culture supernatant has been described previously (4) . Briefly, Costar microtiter wells (Corning Incorporated) coated with a mixture of three different antinucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies, N10E4, N1E8, and N8E1, were vacuum dried and stored at 4\u00b0C before use. One hundred microliters of serum was added to the wells of the microtiter plate coated with the mixture of three antinucleocapsid protein MAbs, and the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. After the wells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20, antinucleocapsid rabbit serum was added at a 1:4,000 dilution and the plate contents were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. After the wells were washed, a 1:5,000 diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Zymed Laboratory Inc., South San Francisco, Calif.) was added. After three further washes, 100 l of tetramethylbenzidine solution was added to each well. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 l of 0.5 N sulfuric acid, and the plates were examined at 450 nm. Samples with an absorbance at 450 nm above the cutoff value (mean of negative control \u03e9 [2.56 \u03eb standard deviation of 1,272 healthy blood donors]) (4) were considered positive.",

In this study, we further confirmed these results using a large number of clinical samples as well as samples obtained during the recurrence of SARS in Guangzhou. Since SARS is a new and poorly understood disease, especially during the early breakout period, many non-SARS patients may be mislabeled as having SARS. Therefore, in order to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of this assay accurately, data analysis was based on a serological diagnosis. Using samples from 325 patients with serologically confirmed SARS-CoV infection, N protein in 100% of the samples (19 of 19) from neutralization test-positive patients and 92.9% of the samples (78 of 84) from serologically confirmed patients taken from days 1 to 5 was detected with the assay. At days 6 to 10, 100% of the samples (5 of 5) from neutralization test-positive patients and 69.8% of the samples (44 of 63) from serologically confirmed patients were still positive for the N protein, and the detection rate of the N protein decreased in later samples. These results are consistent with those from our previous studies (3, 4) . However, the N protein could be detected in 25.6% of the serum specimens (34 of 133) taken from days 1 to 5 and in 16.7% of the serum specimens (14 of 84) taken from days 6 to 10 after the onset of symptoms in patients exhibiting a negative result with SARS-CoV antibody detection (Group III). Since a few patients with SARS have had late seroconversion (11, 14) , to rule out SARS, it is best to test a convalescent-phase serum collected beyond 28 days after the onset of symptoms (http: //www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5228a4.htm). Although these patients were reported as likely to be infected with SARS-CoV according to the World Health Organization criteria, no convalescent-phase serum specimens collected beyond 28 days were available for those patients, and we do not know how many patients were truly infected with SARS-CoV. In addition, another 75 serum specimens from the \"ruled-out\" group and 197 control serum specimens from patients with influenza, dengue, and measles and healthy blood donors had been tested with the N protein capture ELISA, but no positive results were found. Based on serological diagnosis as the \"gold standard, \" the results demonstrated that the antigen capture ELISA permitted a sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV N protein in clinical specimens.",

However, the variation in reported sensitivity and specificity makes it difficult for the RT-PCR to be considered the standard criterion for early diagnosis. Moreover, the best time for a high sensitivity for nasopharyngeal aspirate sampling was on days 8 to 10 after the onset of symptoms (18) or later (1) . Waiting 8 to 10 days to make a firm diagnosis or to plan for appropriate therapy is not possible. Since it is important to diagnose and confirm SARS within the first few days of illness, we studied the N protein as an early diagnostic marker in 325 patients with serologically confirmed SARS-CoV infection. Using the antigen capture ELISA, we were able to demonstrate the presence of the N protein in some serum samples as early as day 1 and up to day 18 ( Fig. 1) , and nearly all sera were found positive for the N protein between days 3 and 5. The detection rates for the N protein of SARS-CoV in serum specimens showed a much higher percentage in blood during the first week of the illness than in subsequent weeks. The N protein in blood, therefore, is considered a good diagnostic marker during the early stage of the SARS-CoV infection. Since the N protein appears relatively stable to freezing and thawing and is stable for many months frozen at \u03ea20\u00b0C, detection of the N protein in serum samples retrospectively did not seem to affect the overall detection rate. In contrast, the storage of the specimens at \u03ea70\u00b0C, which is essential for RT-PCR in order to maintain viral RNA in optimal conditions, is not feasible in many nonresearch laboratories. In addition, the use of serum specimens for diagnosing SARS-CoV infection has the advantage of not requiring respiratory specimens, including sputum, nasopharyngeal aspiration, and endotracheal tube samples, which are regarded as a risk to health care workers.",

Recent serological studies using the N protein-based ELISA have demonstrated that SARS patient sera contained a high level of antibodies against the N protein (16, 19 ). An immunohistochemical assay using a MAb specific for the N protein of SARS-CoV has demonstrated that the N protein was predominantly detected not only in the lung but also in many other organs and tissues in patients with SARS (7) . The presence of N protein in the early acute-phase sera of patients with SARS in our findings suggests that the N protein of SARS-CoV may be a major viral target and released from the virus or infected cell into the blood at an early stage of infection. If so, these features make N protein a suitable candidate for early diagnostic application, and an N proteinbased assay will provide good sensitivity. So far, it is still not clear whether SARS-CoV undergoes a high rate of genetic mutation, although some differences have been observed between the viral genomes sequenced (13) .",

In our previous studies, the optical density of the N protein was highly variable from one individual to another on the same day (3). It is unclear from these data whether this variation predicts clinical outcome. However, based on the clinical data available, we were not able to find any significant differences associated with disease severity and levels of circulating N antigen in the patients with SARS. Previous studies of animal coronavirus have shown that the N protein plays an important role in viral pathogenesis and replication (9) . Future experiments are planned to address the mechanism by which the N protein of SARS-CoV is presented in blood as a viral antigen and its role in viral pathogenesis and/or replication.",

This method overcomes several problems associated with the RT-PCR approach. For example, the problems due to contamination of RT-PCR products are not an issue in antigen detection assays. In addition, ELISA is rapid and easy to perform and can be carried out in less-well-equipped laboratory settings. Widely employing this assay will enhance our ability to provide a rapid response in the event of a return outbreak of SARS.",
