The Institute of Medicine of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has been involved in three priority setting processes, each using different metrics and methodologies: infant mortality equivalents (1985)(1986), cost-effectiveness (2000), and more recently, the implementation of a software system based on a broader multi-criteria systems approach that can include either of the earlier metrics among other various considerations (2015). The systems approach offers users the flexibility to select, combine, rank, weigh and evaluate different attributes representing their perspectives, assumptions, and particular needs. This approach also overcomes concerns relating to the previous single-metric ranking approaches that yielded lists that, once published, were static, and could not readily accommodate new information about emerging pathogens, new scientific advances, or changes in the costs and performance features of interventions. We discuss the rationale and reasoning behind the design of this multi-criteria decision support approach, stakeholder feedback about the tool, and highlight the potential advantages from using this expanded approach to better inform and support vaccine policies.",

The Vaccine Investment Strategy of GAVI (updated every five years, most recently in 2013) is oriented towards determining which vaccines that are already available or likely to be available in the near future that GAVI would support [12] . Similar roles are played at the national level in many countries, e.g., the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) for the U.K. National Health Service that uses costeffectiveness as a formal metric for its analysis [13] .

            "text": "1. Scenario Evaluation. Many strategic planning processes include examination of differing scenarios to determine how robust the proposed plan when underlying conditions change significantly. This process, originating for the military (at the RAND Corporation) and corporate planning (at Royal Dutch Shell), has great potential in public health planning [23, 24] . This ''what if\" option is supported by the sensitivity analysis capabilities of SMART Vaccines, allowing fairly real time evaluation of the value of vaccine options in response to changes such as (a) new therapeutic options emerge, (b) disease incidence changes dramatically, (c) alternative interventions materialize to deal with the problem (e.g. genetic based vector control of mosquitos), and others. Diverse scenarios help test the robustness of a strategic plan against major environmental changes. 2. Program Evaluation. Evaluating public health interventions on a single-metric basis (e.g. live years saved or cost-effectiveness) is common, but is no more rational than choosing among alternatives on the same narrow basis (e.g., mortality or morbidity). The multi-attribute approach embedded in SMART Vaccines also allows for the evaluation of public health interventions once they are deployed. Evaluation and response are standard strategic plan components. 3. Evaluating Competing Approaches to Solving the Problem. Many problems have multiple potential solutions, often with attributes that differ in importance across populations. Systems analysis provides a rational way to consider these issues and weigh the importance of the various attributes in choosing among alternatives. Whenever these attributes cannot be readily captured in cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit approaches, the wider systems-based approach as embedded in SMART Vaccines gains value. As an obvious example, one could consider both malaria and Zika vaccines in a wider analysis that included mosquito netting, mosquito abatement (including introduction of genetically modified mosquitos into active malaria or Zika regions) or treatment options (for malaria) or birth control or pregnancy termination options (in the unique case of Zika). 4. Focusing Goals for Product Development. In the world of vaccines, we observe the practice of creating target product profiles to help guide vaccine R&D efforts. The SMART Vaccines approach can readily assist in sharpening target product profiles by incorporating relevant multiple attributes. This feature allows for clear evaluation of the tradeoffs of improvement along some specific attribute (e.g., number of doses required) vs. others (effectiveness of the vaccine and its consequences, program costs, etc.). The same concept can provide value for wider uses in public health and health care. 5. Clarify Critical Data Needs. In many strategic planning efforts, data quality inherently limits the precision and utility of the plans. SMART Vaccines, through sensitivity testing, allows planners to understand where better data are most important (e.g., those variables where SMART Scores are highly sensitive to small changes in data values). 6. Understand Multiple Stakeholder Perspectives. In most planning endeavors-even those in pure corporate settings-different stakeholders have different perspectives. Thinking through the relevant issues from these different viewpoints will likely enhance the value (not to mention the acceptability) of the final plan. SMART Vaccines helps provide clear and specific information about how these different viewpoints and assumptions might lead to different priorities and plan choices, and also to find areas where people with different priorities may find convergence. 7. Flexibility through Time. As noted, the SMART Vaccines approach has the additional advantage that new vaccine candidates can be readily evaluated as new issues emerge. The sudden and major Ebola outbreak in 2014 and the more recent outbreak of Zika in Brazil highlight the benefits of this approach-data can readily be added to evaluate an Ebola or Zika vaccine against other candidates. The Ebola outbreak also provided a clear example of how the ability to formally incorporate the values of more than one attribute of a vaccine (e.g., costeffectiveness) can lead to markedly different rankings than single metric ranks provide [25] . Static processes cannot achieve this flexibility.",

SMART Vaccines has national population data built in for several dozen countries and limited disease burden data, but users must find or estimate numerous data elements to complete the model. The developers of SMART Vaccines recognized this challenge, but believed that the nature of the problem-not the software-creates the data burden. Careful review of the 1985-86 and 2000 studies show that they faced similar data challenges, and in some cases they ignored the issues when they did not believe that good data could be found. An example (from the 1986 report) is the omission of costs of treating illnesses in developing countries.",

At the beginning of the SMART Vaccines work, IOM's phase I committee heard repeatedly that the narrow focus of the earlier IOM reports reduced their value, since many potential users found that the reports (with a single evaluation metric) simply did not apply to their setting. Thus those stakeholders created their own lists informally or formally, using methods and data that were seldom made public. We believe that with SMART Vaccines in widespread use-including most desirably with a common methodology and datasets-multiple lists will still emerge, but the structure of them will be completely transparent and available to all, since differences in rankings will depend primarily on the values structures employed by different users.",

SMART Vaccines provides a welltested method to convert rank order lists to weights as required by the model [30, 31] . Various methods to create rank order lists have been extensively analyzed in the realm of social choice theory and this literature can guide selection among alternative methods to create group rank order lists.",

It does not create a static list representing a single viewpoint, but instead, a software tool that-when augmented by appropriate population-specific data describing demographics, disease burden, available treatments, and attributes of potential vaccines-allows comparison of existing or newly emerging pathogenic threats from the differing perspectives of multiple users. Individual users or groups-by specifying their particular perspective (i.e., choosing attributes and their weights)-can create and promulgate a priority list representing their viewpoint, and can transparently modify that list under changing circumstances. SMART Vaccines can also facilitate choosing among alternative vaccine product profiles by formally incorporating the trade-offs between design options (e.g., three doses with higher effectiveness vs. one dose with wider coverage and lower costs of storage and administration). We believe that the ability to facilitate the focusing target product profiles is unique to SMART Vaccines.",

Second, by calling attention to the relevant data needs, decision-support tools such as SMART Vaccines can accelerate the development of relevant data resources to support ongoing planning as new challenges emerge. Finally, systems-based planning can formally incorporate all of the issues that affect real-world decisions, making it fully apparent as to how these issues affect final choices. In so doing, SMART Vaccines and other systems analysis tools can help focus the attention of decision makers so that planning becomes truly a cohesive process rather than merely the production of static plans that risk becoming outdated at the moment of publication.
