Accurate determination of the dimer dissociation constant and the role of the N-finger (residues 1-7) will provide more insights into the enzyme catalytic mechanism of SARS 3CL proteinase. The dimer dissociation constant of the wildtype protein was determined to be 14.0 lM by analytical ultracentrifugation method. The N-finger fragment of the enzyme plays an important role in enzyme dimerization as shown in the crystal structure. Key residues in the N-finger have been studied by site-directed mutagenesis, enzyme assay, and analytical ultracentrifugation. A single mutation of M6A was found to be critical to maintain the dimer structure of the enzyme. The N-terminal octapeptide N8 and its mutants were also synthesized and tested for their potency as dimerization inhibitors. Peptide cleavage assay confirms that peptide N8 is a dimerization inhibitor with a K i of 2.20 mM. The comparison of the inhibitory activities of N8 and its mutants indicates that the hydrophobic interaction of Met-6 and the electrostatic interaction of Arg-4 contribute most for inhibitor binding. This study describes the first example of inhibitors targeting the dimeric interface of SARS 3CL proteinase, providing a novel strategy for drug design against SARS and other coronaviruses.",

            "text": "Human coronaviruses are major causes of upper respiratory tract illness in humans. A novel form of coronavirus has been identified as the major cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a disease that had rapidly spread from southern China to several countries in 2003 [1, 2] . Coronaviruses are members of positive-stranded RNA viruses featuring the largest viral RNA genomes known to date. The SARS coronavirus replicase gene encompasses two overlapping translation products, polyprotein 1a ($450 kDa) and 1ab ($750 kDa), which are conserved both in length and amino acid sequence to other coronavirus replicase proteins. Polyprotein 1a and 1ab are cleaved by the internally encoded 3CL proteinase to release functional proteins necessary for virus replication. The SARS 3CL proteinase is fully conserved among all released SARS coronavirus genome sequences and is highly homologous with other coronavirus 3CL proteinases. Due to the functional importance of SARS 3CL proteinase in the viral life cycle, it has been proposed to be a key target for structuralbased drug design against SARS [3] . Virtual screening of chemical compound libraries has discovered potential inhibitors as described by various groups [4] [5] [6] [7] . Several bifunctional boronic acid inhibitors were designed to target the serine cluster (Ser-139, Ser-144, and Ser-147) near the catalytic residues [8] . Peptide analogs and organic compounds derived from known rhinovirus 3C protease inhibitors were also synthesized and some of them were found to be active towards SARS 3CL proteinase [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . The crystal structures of the 3CL proteinases of several coronaviruses have been solved [3, 15, 16] , all of which are dimeric. The enzyme was shown to follow a general base catalytic mechanism [17] . As we have reported previously, the peptide cleavage assay shows that the specific activity for proteolysis decreases linearly with the decrease of enzyme concentration, suggesting that the dimer is the major form for biological activity and that the dimeric interface could be targeted for structural-based drug design against SARS 3CL proteinase [18] . The extra helical domain of the SARS 3CL proteinase was also shown to play an important role in controlling the association-dissociation equilibrium and regulating the activity and specificity of the enzyme [19] . However, there is no published report on the inhibitor design for the dimeric interface to date.",

HIV-1 protease is a homodimer of two identical 99-residue subunits in which the active site is generated by the self-assembly of these subunits. The dimeric structure is stabilized by an extended anti-parallel b-sheet formed by the inter-digitations of the N-terminal (residues 1-4) and C-terminal (residues 96-99) b-strands of each monomer [22] . Peptides with the N-and C-terminal amino acid sequences have been designed and confirmed as dimerization inhibitors [21, 27] . A large set of oligopeptides has been derived from the terminal fragments of HIV-1 protease by computer modeling, and their inhibiting activities have been determined experimentally. The best inhibitor has an IC 50 value of less than 1 lM [20] . Cross-linked N-and C-terminal peptides also inhibit HIV-1 protease activity and reduce the fraction of dimers in solution as measured by size-exclusion chromatography [25] . Design of dimerization inhibitors has also been reported for many other viral enzymes, such as HIV reverse transcriptase, intergrase, herpes simplex virus ribonucleotide reductase, and DNA polymerase [24] .",

In the present paper, we have studied the key residues in the N-finger of SARS 3CL proteinase by site-directed mutagenesis, activity test, and analytical ultracentrifugation. The N-terminal octapeptide N8 and its nine mutants were also synthesized and tested for their inhibitory activities. The dimer dissociation constants of the SARS 3CL proteinase and N-terminal mutants were determined by sedimentation velocity and equilibrium methods.

An An60Ti rotor and standard six-sector equilibrium centerpieces were used. The freshly prepared wild-type and mutational SARS 3CL proteinase was further purified and buffer-exchanged using a gel filtration column, Superdex 75 10/300 GL (Amersham Bioscience), into sedimentation buffer (40 mM phosphate buffer, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, pH 7.3). The molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm (1.04 mg/cm 2 ), density of the sedimentation buffer (1.005 g/ml), partial specific volume (0.723 ml/g), and molecular weight of the monomer (33 914 Da) were calculated based on its amino acid composition using the program SEDNTERP (http:// www.bbri.org/rasmb/rasmb.html). For sedimentation velocity experiments, 380 ll samples (concentrations between 0.1 and 4 mg/ml) and 400 ll reference solutions were loaded into cells. The rotor temperature was equilibrated at 20\u00b0C and rotor speeds of 60,000 rpm. Absorbance scans at 230, 280 or 290 nm were collected at a time interval of 4 min. Data were analyzed with the software Sedfit version 8.9 g [28, 29] . For the sedimentation equilibrium experiments, 110 ll samples and 120 ll reference solutions were loaded into nitrogen-flushed cells, followed by degassing and a further nitrogen flush prior to sealing. The protein was equilibrated for data collection at 20\u00b0C and three rotor speeds (15,000, 20,000, and 25,000 rpm). Once equilibrium was reached (typically 24-32 h), absorption data were collected at 280 nm, using a radial step size of 0.001 cm, and recorded as the average of 10 measurements at each radial position. To determine the baseline values in the cell, at the end of the data collection time the rotor speed was increased to 42,000 rpm for 8 h, and the absorbance of the depleted meniscus was measured. Dissociation constants were determined by fitting a monomer-dimer equilibrium model using the Origin-based data analysis software for Beckman XL-A/XL-I (Beckman Instruments, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA).

Our experiments showed that the N-finger deletion mutant D7N could not form any dimer (Fig. 3B) , which agrees with the previous report that the N-finger deletion mutant is in monomeric form in solution [35] . However, the seven residues in the N-finger contribute differently to the dimer stability. From Fig. 4 , we can see that the side chains of Phe-3 and Lys-5 point away from the dimer interface to the interior of the same monomer. Ser-1, Gly-2, and Ala-7 do not have remarkable interactions. The two most important residues among the seven are Arg-4 and Met-6. The guanidyl group of Arg-4 in one monomer forms a salt bridge with the side chain of Glu-290 in the other monomer, which is one of the major interactions between the two monomers. Furthermore, the side chain of Met-6 forms hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of the Phe-140 and Tye-126 in its partner. This suggests that residues Arg-4 and Met-6 are the two possible key residues for the N-finger role in dimer stability. However, Chou et al. [33] reported that the mutation of R4A only partly affects the dimerization of SARS 3CL proteinase and keeps most enzymatic activity, which means that Arg-4 might not be the dominating factor to the dimer interface. In this study, R4E and M6A mutants were shown to have very weak dimerization according to sedimentation experiments (Figs. 3C and E) and have no detectable enzyme activity either (Table 1) . Substituting the positively charged Arg-4 with a negatively charged Glu makes it impossible to form a salt bridge with the Glu-290 in the other monomer and even cause charge repulsion. The mutation of M6A suggests that the hydrophobic interactions between the side chain of Met-6 and Phe-140, Tye-126 in the other monomer contribute significantly to the stability of the dimer.",

The N-finger of one monomer is important for the enzyme activity of the other monomer [15, 16] . So it is easy to understand the phenomenon of no dimer, no activity. The mutation of R4A kept most of the enzymic activity and did not affect the dimerization severely [33] , which means that the electrostatic interaction contributed by the salt bridge between Arg-4 and Glu-290 may not be vital to the dimerization. However, the alanine substitution of Met-6 would be lethal to the dimer. In fact, Arg-4 is not conserved and can be substituted by lysine or valine in several other coronavirus 3CL proteinases, while Met-6 is highly conserved with Leu substitution in very few cases [15] . As a single Met-6 to Ala mutation makes the enzyme to be mostly a monomer with no detectable activity, the hydrophobic effect of Met-6 should play a key role in the dimerization. Since dimerization of SARS 3CL proteinase is necessary for the enzyme activity, the interface of the dimer may be used as a new target for structure-based drug design [18, 19] . From the N-terminal mutational analysis, we propose that a hydrophobic group and an acidic moiety that can form strong hydrogen bonds with ARG-4 are essential to design strong dimer interface binding inhibitors.",

The peptide inhibitor (and other peptide mutants) was premixed with the His-tagged enzyme before peptide cleavage assay for 1-2 h. The peptide N8 has obvious inhibitory activity at millimolar level.

In the Zhang-Poorman analysis, a dimerization inhibitor alters the y-intercept value by a factor of [I]/K i , but has no effect on the slope [20, 27] . Dimerization inhibitors are easily identified using the Zhang-Poorman plot as they provide lines that are parallel with that from the protease alone, while competitive and non-competitive inhibitors give non-parallel lines [36] . Zhang-Poorman plot has been successfully applied in many protease dimerization inhibitor studies [20, 23, 25, 27, 36] . Fig. 5 shows that the line in the presence of 0.8 mM peptide N8 is parallel with that in the absence of inhibitor.

Since the Nfinger fragment adopts an extended conformation in the crystal structure, the side chain of Lys-5 points outwards to the dimer interface and does not participate in the enzyme dimerization. The mutation of Lys-5 to Ala (peptide N83) only slightly decreases the inhibiting activity of the N-finger fragment, indicating that Lys-5 contributes little to the inhibitor binding. However, in peptide N86, the peptide backbone may turn around with the Lys-5 taking the place of Arg-4 and interacting with the enzyme, due to the loss of the conformation restriction offered originally by Arg-4 and Met-6. This is confirmed by the triple-mutation peptide N87, which shows little inhibition activity.",

The N-finger octapeptide N8 has been synthesized and confirmed to be a dimerization inhibitor with a K i of 2.20 mM. Several N8 peptide mutants were also synthesized and tested for their inhibition activity. The hydrophobic interaction of Met-6 and the electrostatic interaction of is parallel with the lower line, indicating that the inhibitor N8 is a dimerization inhibitor of the proteinase, which prevents the enzyme proteolysis activity by disturbing the natural proteinase dimerization.",
