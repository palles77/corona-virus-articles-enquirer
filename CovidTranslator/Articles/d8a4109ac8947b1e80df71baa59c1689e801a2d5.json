Herein, we show that SL1 is functionally and structurally bipartite. While the upper region of SL1 is required to be paired, we observe strong genetic selection against viruses that contain a deletion of A35, an extrahelical nucleotide that destabilizes SL1, in favor of genomes that contain a diverse panel of destabilizing second-site mutations, due to introduction of a non-canonical base pair near A35. Viruses containing destabilizing SL1-\u0394A35 mutations also contain one of two specific mutations in the 3' UTR. Thermal denaturation and imino proton solvent exchange experiments reveal that the lower half of SL1 is unstable and that second-site SL1-\u0394A35 substitutions are characterized by one or more features of the wild-type SL1. We propose a \"dynamic SL1\" model, in which the base of SL1 has an optimized lability required to mediate a physical interaction between the 5' and 3' UTRs that stimulates subgenomic RNA synthesis. Although not conserved at the nucleotide sequence level, these general structural characteristics of SL1 appear to be conserved in other coronaviral genomes.",

We have developed a consensus secondary structure model based on the sequences of nine coronaviruses, in which the 5' leader RNA, consisting of the 5' most 72 nucleotides of the 5' UTR in MHV, is characterized by two conserved stem-loop structures, denoted SL1 and SL2. 19, 20 We have shown that SARS-CoV SL1 and SL2 can replace their MHV counterparts in an otherwise MHV genomic RNA; these chimeric viruses are transcriptionally active and replication competent. 19 This experiment strongly supports the predicted secondary structural architecture of the 5' UTR in MHV. SL2 is a highly conserved pentaloop containing structural features consistent with a U-turn architecture that plays a critical role in subgenomic RNA synthesis, as well as in translation . 20 In this report, we extensively characterize the functional and structural properties of SL1. We show that SL1 adopts a bipartite structure with the functional boundary two consecutive pyrimidine-pyrimidine (pyr-pyr) base pairs in the middle of the SL1 helix. 20 The upper region of the stem must be base paired to support viral replication to near wild-type levels. In striking contrast, characterization of mutant viruses in which an unpaired nucleotide, A35, is deleted, leads to the recovery of a diverse collection of mutant viruses that contain single-nucleotide second site mutations in the lower half of SL1, all of which are kinetically and thermodynamically destabilizing. In addition, these viruses contain one of two single nucleotide substitutions in the extreme 3' UTR of the genome. Nonviable mutants in this region of SL1, like SL2 mutants characterized previously, 20 fail to support sgRNA synthesis. These data taken collectively suggest that the base of SL1 must adopt an optimized stability or kinetic lability to mediate a long-range interaction between the 5' and 3' UTRs that is an obligate step in the transcription of sgRNAs. The nature of this interaction is discussed.",

In addition, these NMR studies also suggested that either A35 or A36 is an unpaired extrahelical nucleotide and that the alternative pairing of U9 with A35 or A36 introduces a local destabilization in this region of SL1 stem. 20 Interestingly, the predicted SL1s in other coronaviral genomes also appear to conserve this general features of a rather weakly paired region at the base or middle of SL1, containing either or both non-canonical base pairs and extrahelical nucleotides, suggesting that this might be important for replication of MHV and perhaps other coronaviruses.

Plaque size phenotypes (Table 1 , Supplementary Figure S1 ) and one-step growth curves (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S2) were measured for all viable viruses. Deletion of each of the three cytidines unique to MHV (C16, C19 and C20, with C16 predicted to be extrahelical) either singly or all three together gave rise to viable viruses with WT-like growth characteristics (Supplementary Figure S2 (a) ). Thus, the C residues are dispensable for viral replication justifying our use of the wild-type model (denoted WT*) in physical studies presented below (see Figure 1 (b), Figure 5 , Figure 6 (a), and Figure 7 ).

SL1-B, SL1-C, SL1-D, SL1-\u0394C16/19/20 and SL1-\u0394A35/C34U/3'A78G viruses appeared to synthesize the lowest absolute quantities of genomic and sgRNAs (<32% of wild type), while the other SL1 mutant viruses directed the synthesis of virus-specific RNAs to levels greater than 55% of those observed with wild type virus. One nonviable mutant, SL1-A, was also assayed for the ability to synthesize subgenomic RNA (sgRNA 7) and genomic RNAs by a series of RT-PCR assays of RNA extracted from electroporated cells.

            "text": "The functional data presented above are consistent with what we term a \"dynamic SL1\" hypothesis, which posits that the lower region of SL1 must be thermodynamically destabilized and/or dynamically (kinetically) labile in a way that is dependent only on the general physical features of this region of the SL1, rather than the precise nucleotide sequence, in order to fully support virus replication. In order to test this hypothesis and gain additional insight into SL1 structure, we synthesized three representative second-site SL1 revertant mutant RNAs (see Figure 1 (c)) and measured their thermodynamic stabilities using quantitative opticallymonitored thermal denaturation methods ( Optical melting profiles (dA/dT) are shown for the WT*, \u0394A35, \u0394A35/U33C, \u0394A35/C34U, \u0394A35/A36U SL1 RNAs in Figure 6 with the thermodynamic parameters described from a quantitative analysis of these melts compiled in Table 2 . In contrast to all of the other RNAs, the optical melting profile of the \u0394A35 SL1 RNA is well-modeled by a single two-state unfolding transition with a t m of 80.3 \u00b0C with an van't Hoff enthalpy of unfolding (\u0394H vH ) of 118 kcal mol \u22121 (Table 1) . Thermodynamic parameters derived from melting curves acquired using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are in excellent agreement with the optical melts, as well as the expected \u0394H estimated from the nearest neighbor model. 21 In contrast, melting profiles obtained for the WT* RNA as well as the three \u0394A35 second site revertant mutant RNAs are broader than that obtained for the \u0394A35 RNA; they also unfold at significantly lower t m . A broadened unfolding transition is consistent with a superposition of two sequential twostate unfolding transitions, e.g., the lower and upper regions of the SL1 stem, or extreme nontwo state unfolding behavior of the SL1 stem in a single transition. In both cases, fitting of these melting profiles to a single two-state transition would result in insufficient van't Hoff enthalpy of unfolding (\u0394H vH ) to account for the unfolding of the entire 14-base pair stem ( Figure 6 ). This is exactly what we observe, with the apparent \u0394H vH of \u224870-75 kcal mol \u22121 in each case (fits not shown). Invoking a sequential two-state unfolding transition model reveals two unfolding steps with different amplitudes. If we assign the first unfolding step to the denaturation of the lower four base pairs in SL1 (predicted \u0394H vH =38 kcal mol \u22121 ; t m =61 \u00b0C) 22 then we recover sufficient \u0394H vH in the second (major) transition (70-86 kcal mol \u22121 ) to account for unfolding of the entire molecule. From these fits we calculate that the wild-type RNA is destabilized by 3.0 kcal mol \u22121 relative the \u0394A35 mutant, while the three second site revertants are destabilized by 2.1 (\u0394A35/U33C), 4.5 (\u0394A35/C34U) and 4.7 (\u0394A35/A36U) kcal mol \u22121 . These data reveal that the each of the recovered revertant RNAs share a common physical property with the wild-type RNA, i.e., all are thermodynamically destabilized relative to \u0394A35 mutant.",

For the \u0394A35 RNA, imino proton solvent exchange rates are globally quenched, but most strongly near the site of the deletion. For example, the k ex values of U9, G10 and U31 are strongly attenuated in the \u0394A35 RNA, by \u224810-, \u224832-, and \u22485-fold, respectively. Inspection of the base pair dynamics for the three mutant SL1 RNAs reveals that each re-introduces or accentuates one or more specific features of the kinetic lability that characterizes the WT* RNA. For example, in all three RNAs, the imino proton solvent exchange rates of the U13\u2022U31 base pair are elevated relative to the \u0394A35 RNA, by 4-10-fold, some more so than in the WT* RNA. This perturbation is local in the \u0394A35/U33C RNA, but next-nearest neighbor and long-range in the \u0394A35/C34U and \u0394A35/A36U RNAs, respectively. The solvent exchange rate of G10 is also increased in all RNAs, most prominently in the \u0394A35/C34U RNA in the context of the new G10\u2022U34 base pairing, but also in the other two revertant RNAs (by 3-4 fold). These data argue that the base of SL1 through the pyrimidine base pairing region in both the WT* and second site mutant SL1s recovered from the genetically unstable SL1-\u0394A35 virus must be conformationally heterogeneous and dynamically unstable; this, in turn, allows this region to become transiently unfolded so that a long-range interaction with the 3' UTR in MHV can occur.",

An early event in these processes, however, may well be genome circularization which places the 5' and 3' termini of the viral genome in close physical proximity to facilitate template switching during sgRNA minus strand synthesis. Template switching is simply hybridization of the nascently synthesized minus strand corresponding to the intergenic or body TRS sequences with the complementary leader TRS, a process expected to be strongly stimulated by the close physical proximity of the two complementary sequences. This process is almost certainly regulated by highly specific RNA structural motifs found in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) and associated interactions with virally encoded and/ or host proteins. The 5' leader RNA appended to all sgRNAs corresponds to the extreme 5' end of the 5' UTR and is composed of two stem-loop structures termed SL1 and SL2 just upstream of the transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS) that defines the leader-body junction. 19 Characterization of non-viable viruses that harbor mutations in SL1 (this work) or SL2 20 reveals that these genomes are generally wild-type with respect to synthesis of full-length genomic and anti-genomic RNAs; however, all are absolutely impaired in sgRNA synthesis.",

However, there is little direct evidence for or against a physical association of the 5' and 3' ends of the genome that might be required for sgRNA synthesis, as well as the nature of that interaction (RNA-, protein-mediated or both), although it has been proposed that circularization stabilized by a protein bridge composed of cap-binding protein, eIF4E, eIF4G and poly(A) binding protein 31 might be important for initiation of the replicase gene translation. 32 During the course of testing the functional impact of mutations deposited in the MHV SL1, we have uncovered two critical aspects of SL1 that are required for sgRNA synthesis. Here, we present the first genetic evidence in support of a direct interaction between SL1 and the extreme 3' end of the genome; furthermore, the physical analysis of RNAs harboring second site revertants in SL1 recovered from the genetically unstable SL1-\u0394A35 viruses, allows us to pinpoint clear structural requirements for the lower region of SL1 (below the pyr-pyr base pairs mapped by NMR spectroscopy) that are essential for supporting viral replication.",

Genomes containing A5G/U40C or A7G/U38C mutations that stabilize the extreme lower portion of the stem could not be recovered as viable viruses. While deletion of A35 is still viable, this virus is genetically unstable, and gives rise to second site mutations in both the 5' and 3'UTRs. Interestingly, all the second site mutations in the 5'UTR are located below the pyr-pyr base pairs, and introduce noncanonical base pairs to maintain stem formation. Each of these mutants SL1 stem structures are less thermodynamically stable compared with the genetically unstable SL1-\u0394A35 mutant which forms a fully base-paired helical stem. These mutations also introduce conformational heterogeneity in this region as well. Interestingly, the MHV SL1-\u0394A35 revertant mutants bear some resemblance to the predicted secondary structure of a wild-type SL1 from a related group 2 CoV, HKU1. 19,33 HKU1 SL1 does not contain an extrahelical nucleotide but instead is characterized by tandem predicted A\u2022C and G\u2022A mismatches in precisely the same region where 5' UTR SL1 second site mutations map in MHV.",

The k ex results show that the lower half of the SL1 is kinetically labile, and the three second site revertant mutants recover one or more dynamic characteristics of the WT* RNA relative to \u0394A35 mutant. Indeed, the closer the site of mutation localizes to A35, the more similar the dynamic properties become relative to the WT* RNA. Therefore, a less stable and more flexible SL1 might facilitate a specific interaction between the single-stranded RNA in this region and a host-or virally encoded protein(s) that is crucial for genome circularization and replication. A cartoon model that graphically illustrates this idea is shown in Figure 9 , where the structure, conformational ensemble or longer-lived partially opened form(s) of SL1, schematized by A1' relative to fully base paired A structure, lowers the energy barrier for formation of a complex with hypothetical protein B, which in turn drives genome circularization and subgenomic RNA synthesis.",

This result suggests that the nucleotide sequence of the 5' region of SL1 may also be important for viability. While this motif is not absolutely essential when the base of SL1 is predicted to be unpaired ( 6 GAG 8 to 6 CUC 8 in the SL1-C virus; Table 1 ), a lethal mutation results when same mutation is introduced while maintaining base pairing here (in the SL1-CD virus; Table 1 ), i.e., in a structural context most similar to that of wild-type MHV. This short sequence motif is conserved and predicted to base paired in all group 2 CoV genomes with the exception of SARS-CoV, which has an 5'-AGGU sequence in what is predicted to be a weakly paired region of SL1 with the A extrahelical. 19 Strikingly, this SL1 5'-6 GAG 8 sequence is identical to the 5'-GAG sequence recovered from second site mutations codeposited in 3' UTR in the same viruses; this suggests the possibility that an oligomer of the same protein(s) capable of recognizing and/or \"melting out\" this short purine-rich motif may well play an important role in mediating a physical interaction between 5' and 3' UTRs. An excellent candidate for this role is hnRNAP A1 since both 3' UTR mutations occur in exactly the same sequence context, 5'-GAAG, a near-consensus binding site for A1, and each replaces the second A with a G, a consensus hnRNAP A1 binding site, 34-35 with the 5'-AG the key specificity determinant. hnRNAP A1 possesses RNA chaperone or helix destabilization activity and has been shown to bind the 3' UTR in MHV, while hnRNP A1 as well as PTB both bind to the complementary strands at the 5' end of MHV RNA. These proteins together mediate the formation of an RNP complex involving the 5'-and 3'-end fragments of MHV RNA in vitro. 36",

Overall, we demonstrate that SL1 must possess an optimum stability or kinetic lability required to mediate a key longrange physical interaction between the 5' and 3' UTR that is critical specifically for subgenomic RNA synthesis, but not required for genomic minus strand synthesis. This finding suggests that the structural requirements and/or the nature of the assembled replication complexes that are capable of synthesizing full-length genomic RNA are (is) distinct from those that are capable of synthesizing sgRNAs. Such a functionally bipartite structure where a sub-region of a helical stem below tandem wobble pairs is tuned to an optimum stability is reminiscent of stem I of the U2 snRNA; here, these features have been hypothesized to allow U2 to adopt a number of mutually exclusive folded conformations during spliceosome assembly and catalysis. 37",

In all cases, BHK-R cells were electroporated with in vitro transcripts corresponding to the genomes of MHV-A59 1000 (wild type), SL1-A, or a A59/nsp12-FS frameshift mutant incapable of directing the synthesis of viral RNAs. Total RNAs were extracted at the times indicated (4, 8, 12 h post-electroporation) and analyzed by RT-PCR (see Methods) for (a) \"\u2212\" sense antigenomic RNA; (b) \"\u2212\" and \"+\" sense sgRNA 7; or (c) genomic RNA. Note that total RNA is used as the template for reverse transcription in panels A and B; poly(A)+ RNA was used as template in panel C and duplicate samples were analyzed. The arrows indicate the position of the amplicons expected for each RNA species. GAPDH, RNA recovery control. Imino proton regions of 1D jump-return echo spectra acquired at 10 \u00b0C, 10 mM KP i , pH 6.0 for WT* (a), \u0394A35 (b), \u0394A35/U33C (c), \u0394A35/C34U (d) and \u0394A35/A36U (e). Imino protons corresponding to non-canonical base pairs are shown in bold. Note that some spectra (WT*, \u0394A35/U33C, \u0394A35/C34U) are characterized by slow conformational heterogeneity at the base portion of SL1 (A5-U40, G6-C39, and A7-U38 base pairs). The mutations are shaded in red. k ex could not be unambiguously measured for the G8 for the middle three RNAs due to spectral overlap with G15; the same is true of G14 and G17 imino protons in all spectra. In these cases, the average k ex is plotted. The fully based paired SL1 (A, modeled by the \u0394A35 RNA) exists in equilibrium with one or more higher energy conformers (A', WT* and \u0394A35 second site revertants) that are partially unfolded or experience dynamic destabilization as a result of non-canonical pairing. A hypothetical protein (B) binds to both A and A' to form the same partially unwound AB complex, but the affinity of B for A' will be higher since the full energetic cost of unfolding the lower stem will not have to be paid; this interaction then mediates a long distance RNA-RNA, RNA-protein or protein-protein interaction which is crucial for the viral replication. Thermodynamic parameters derived for the unfolding of WT*, SL1-\u0394A35, SL1-\u0394A35/U33C, SL1-\u0394A35/C34U, and SL1-\u0394A35/A36U",
