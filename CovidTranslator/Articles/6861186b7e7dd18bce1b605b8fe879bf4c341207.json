Historically, emerging diseases occur abruptly in outbreaks of unknown cause. Although various efforts have been proposed and conducted to analyze secondary data periodically (6) (7) (8) (9) , they generally provide information for the less urgent decision making in health policy and may not be in time for infectious disease control. Thus, a task force is needed to provide timely and accurate diagnosis for early control of any potential epidemic infection, especially in a newly developed country like Taiwan, where the healthcare resources may not be evenly distributed and autopsy for diagnosis is not widely accepted culturally.",

TCDC was in charge of the investigation. \u2020Cases were categorized into >1 of the following clinical syndromes: acute neurologic (encephalitis, meningitis), acute respiratory (pneumonia), acute hemorrhagic, acute diarrhea, acute jaundice (hepatitis), acute heart (myocarditis, pericarditis, endocarditis), and acute kidney-related. For every reported case, COUNEX investigators usually selected diagnostic tests relevant to a particular syndrome (www.cdc.gov.tw). Additional tests were prescribed if needed. The hospital laboratories were requested to save all remaining clinical specimens, including biopsy specimens, obtained from clinical management and send them to our reference laboratories, if indicated. \u2021If an autopsy was performed, whenever possible tissue specimens were examined by pathologists of TCDC-designated medical centers and the Forensic Department of the Ministry of Justice to ensure the accuracy of the fi nal diagnosis. Specimens were also sent for microbiologic cultures and tests as well as toxicologic examination for trace toxic chemicals, if needed. \u00a7All laboratory results and clinical, epidemiologic, and pathologic data were sent to the expert committee to determine if the etiologic agent could fully or most likely explain the disease. Otherwise, cases were categorized as unexplained. In general, histopathogic examination was the major evidence for determining cause. If casepatients could not be autopsied within 36 hours of death, laboratory results would be the most useful information for identifi cation of cause of death.",

We defi ned the surveillance case-patient as a previously healthy resident who died or was admitted to a hospital with a lifethreatening illness possibly caused by infection of unidentifi ed etiology. Usually the death occurred within 3 days of the patient's admission. Patients were excluded if the cause of death was noninfectious. A life-threatening illness was defi ned as any illness requiring admission to an intensive care unit or reported as being critical. An infectious disease is generally suspected if the case-patient has >1 of the characteristics such as fever, leukocytosis, histopathologic evidence of an acute infectious process or more specifi c symptom patterns, or infection precipitating adult respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure, or sepsis. A total of 130 cases were reported during 2000-2005, for an annual average rate of 0.12 cases per 100,000 persons. The annual incidence rates varied by year and among 4 branches of Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Table) . The highest rate was in the eastern branch, where surveillance was conducted in a well-defi ned population of \u2248596,119 persons. Ninety-fi ve (73%) of the case-patients died. For 47 (49%) of those who died, an autopsy was performed, a rate much higher than the national autopsy rate of <11% (12). The mean age of case-patients was 33.8 years. The incidence rates varied by age group; it was highest in those 85-89 years of age, followed by those <1-4 years, and then 65-69 years, with 0.48, 0.30, and 0.23 per 100,000 person-years, respectively.

This system was particularly useful for infection control at remote regions with limited resources. Most physicians in the rural eastern part of the country have less access to consultation and referral to other specialties in medical centers and teaching hospitals. Thus, they rely more on this kind of surveillance system for early detection of potential infectious threats. This was especially important for acute unexpected deaths, as was demonstrated by a higher incidence and autopsy rates in eastern Taiwan.",
