            "text": "SHP-1 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that negatively regulates cytokine signaling and inflammatory gene expression. Mice genetically lacking SHP-1 (me=me) display severe inflammatory demyelinating disease following intracranial inoculation with the BeAn strain of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) compared to infected wild-type mice. Furthermore, SHP-1-deficient mice show a profound and predominant infiltration of blood-derived macrophages into the CNS following intracerebral injection of TMEV, and these macrophages are concentrated in areas of demyelination in brain and spinal cord. In the present study we investigated the role of SHP-1 in controlling CNS inflammatory demyelination following a peripheral instead of an intracerebral inoculation of TMEV. Surprisingly, we found that while wild-type mice were entirely refractory to intraperitoneal (IP) infection by TMEV, in agreement with previous studies, all SHP-1-deficient mice displayed profound macrophage neuroinvasion and macrophage-mediated inflammatory demyelination. Moreover, SHP-1 deficiency led to increased expression of inflammatory molecules in macrophages, serum, and CNS following IP infection with TMEV. Importantly, pharmacological depletion of peripheral macrophages significantly decreased both paralysis and CNS viral loads in SHP-1-deficient mice. In addition, peripheral MCP-1 neutralization attenuated disease severity, decreased macrophage infiltration into the CNS, and decreased monocyte numbers in the blood of SHP-1-deficient mice, implicating MCP-1 as an important mediator of monocyte migration between multiple tissues. These results demonstrate that peripheral TMEV infection results in a unique evolution of macrophage-mediated demyelination in SHP-1-deficient mice, implicating SHP-1 in the control of neuroinvasion of inflammatory macrophages and neurotropic viruses into the CNS.",

Several studies demonstrated that MS lesions contain multiple leukocyte cell types, including lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, all of which are believed to contribute to lesion formation by various distinct and interacting mechanisms (48, 55) . Among these leukocyte subsets, abundant peripherallyderived macrophages have been identified as major effectors of demyelination in MS (14, 16, 37, 88) .

Induction of an increased inflammatory profile of macrophages has generally been ascribed to signals originating from autoreactive lymphocytes in MS. However, intrinsic defects in innate macrophage-mediated effector functions may also be critical to achieve substantial inflammatory potential to cause demyelinating activity in the CNS. Interestingly, we have recently demonstrated that monocyte-derived macrophages of MS patients have deficient levels of the phosphatase SHP-1 relative to those of normal control subjects (20) . SHP-1 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase with two SH2 domains which acts as a negative regulator of both innate and acquired immune cytokine signaling via inflammatory transcription factors NF-kB, STAT1, and STAT6 (11, 28, 36, 45, 61, 62) . Accordingly, we showed that deficient levels of SHP-1 in MS macrophages were directly responsible for the increased activation of these inflammatory transcription factors compared to those of normal subjects (20) .",

When susceptible strains of mice are inoculated intracerebrally (IC) with TMEV the mice develop immune-mediated demyelinating disease resembling human MS. TMEV infection leads to biphasic disease with an early gray matter infection followed with later progressive white matter disease involving a complex array of leukocytes and pro-inflammatory molecules that eventually cause demyelination. Chronic disease is associated with limb paralysis, demyelinating spinal cord lesions, and extensive white matter mononuclear cell infiltrates, consisting primarily of lymphocytes and macrophages (50, 68) . It is now well accepted that while lymphocytes may act as initiators=perpetuators of demyelination, macrophages are the major effectors of demyelination that may act in large measure autonomously of lymphocytic influences (7, 22, 50, 76, 77, 80) .",

We demonstrate that following intraperitoneal (IP) infection with TMEV (BeAn strain), a high percentage of me=me mice show paralysis within the first week of infection, in sharp contrast to wild-type mice, which are completely resistant to disease. Furthermore, the spinal cords of me=me mice following IP TMEV inoculation show extensive inflammatory demyelinating lesions associated with abundant and exclusive infiltration of macrophages. Importantly, depletion of peripheral macrophages delayed the onset of TMEV-induced paralysis, decreased CNS macrophage infiltration and demyelination, and decreased CNS viral loads. Invading macrophages contained abundant viral antigens, suggesting that SHP-1 controlled both migration of monocytes from the periphery into the CNS, and macrophage infection within the CNS. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have identified the chemokine MCP-1 as an important stimulus of macrophage migration and virus infection in the CNS. These results indicate that a deficiency in SHP-1 establishes a permissive state in which peripheral TMEV infection results in enhanced macrophage infiltration into the CNS, virus replication, and inflammatory demyelination. Thus SHP-1 appears to alter multiple aspects of macrophage biology that control virus replication, chemokine responsiveness, and inflammatory activity, that directly relate to virus-induced demyelinating disease.",

Because of the profound susceptibility of me=me mice to TMEV and the inherently unnatural route of infection used in these prior studies, it was of interest to determine whether me=me mice may also be susceptible to CNS disease following peripheral inoculation of TMEV. Therefore, wild-type and SHP-1-deficient mice (me=me) mice received IP inoculation with different doses of BeAn TMEV (Fig. 1) . The mice were further monitored for signs of paralysis for a period of 3 mo and the numbers of mice that showed signs of paralysis were determined (Fig. 1B) . SHP-1deficient mice that received either 10 8 or 10 6 pfu of TMEV showed initial signs of paralysis at approximately 3 dpi, and by 6 dpi almost all of the mice were at 5 on our severity scale ( Fig. 1A) . Furthermore, the amounts of virus injected correlated with disease severity in me=me mice. In sharp contrast wild-type mice did not show any evidence of paralysis, even when infected with 10 8 pfu and observed for 3 mo. We concluded that a genetic deficiency in SHP-1 in mice allowed rapid progression of peripheral TMEV infection to clinical signs of paralysis.",

Similar results were seen at 6 dpi. The levels of cytokines and chemokines expressed in the CNS correlated well with mRNA levels as represented by both TNF-a and MCP-1 ( Fig. 3G and H) . In addition, there were increased expression levels of the adhesion molecule VCAM-1 in the brains of me=me mice following IP TMEV infection, indicating that vascular endothelial cells may be similarly affected (Fig. 3I) .

Similarly to our observations in the CNS, the serum levels of TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-13 were increased in me=me mice compared to wild-type mice, with the exception of IFN-g. Similarly, the chemokine MCP-1 was also increased in the serum of me=me mice compared to wild-type mice (Fig. 4F ).

To directly demonstrate this role, macrophages were experimentally depleted in vivo by injecting mice with liposome-encapsulated clodronate. Clodronate liposomes cause transient and selective elimination of macrophages in the spleen, multiple peripheral tissues, and CD11b \u00fe =Ly6C hi monocytes in the blood (39, 82) . In contrast, clodronate liposomes do not deplete microglia in the brain (5, 70) . In previous studies by our group and others, clodronate liposomes were successfully used to deplete blood-derived macrophages, thus preventing them from participating as effectors in CNS inflammatory disease (18, 33, 40, 87) . In the present experiment, wild-type and me= me mice received either clodronate liposomes or PBS control liposomes as previously described (18), at 2 d before and 2 and 6 d after IP injection of TMEV. Clodronate liposome treatment effectively depleted macrophages (CD45 hi CD11b \u00fe cells) from the spleens of both wild-type and me=me mice, but there was no depletion seen with PBS control liposomes (data not shown). Infected me=me mice that were pretreated with clodronate liposomes had significantly delayed signs of paralysis compared to mice treated with control liposomes (Fig. 5A) . Furthermore, peripheral macrophage depletion resulted in significantly decreased mortality (64%) in infected me=me mice compared to control-liposome-treated mice (100%). In addition, to assess the effect of macrophage depletion on demyelination in the spinal cords of TMEVinfected me=me mice following treatment with clodronate liposomes, double-color immunohistochemistry for MBP and CD11b was performed (Fig. 6A-D) . Spinal cords of TMEVinfected wild-type mice that were treated with either control or clodronate liposomes were free of CD11b \u00fe macrophages and showed no signs of demyelination ( Fig. 6A and B) .

Because TMEV infection of the CNS in the experiments described here originated in the periphery, the main targets of TMEV infection in mice are macrophages, and macrophages are common (Fig. 5B ) and viral antigen (Fig. 6E-H) were examined at 6 dpi in the spinal cords of TMEV-infected mice that had been pretreated with either control or clodronate liposomes. Viral RNA was significantly reduced in the spinal cords of clodronate-liposome-treated compared to controlliposome-treated infected me=me mice, from 10 8 copies down to 10 4 copies (Fig. 5B) . Similarly, the presence of the TMEV antigen in the spinal cords of infected mice was measured with immunohistochemistry ( Fig. 6E-H) . Spinal cords of TMEVinfected wild-type mice that were either treated with control or clodronate liposomes did not show any signs of TMEV antigen ( Fig. 6E and F) . In contrast, spinal cords of infected SHP-1deficient me=me mice that were treated with control liposomes showed substantial TMEV antigen throughout the spinal cord, in the gray and white matter, and particularly in infiltrating macrophages (Fig. 6G) . Importantly, macrophage depletion in infected me=me mice with clodronate liposomes resulted in a substantial decrease in TMEV antigens in spinal cord sections (Fig. 6H) . These data suggest that SHP-1 may control virus neuroinvasion via macrophages in the CNS.",

Therefore, cultured macrophages from wild-type and me=me mice were infected with TMEV for 48 h and the viral genome levels, virus antigens, and inflammatory profile were assessed (Fig. 7) . SHP-1-deficient macrophages had significantly higher TMEV RNA and antigen compared to wild-type macrophages ( Fig. 7A and B) . Furthermore, TMEV infection resulted in increased secretion of the cytokines TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6, and MCP-1 in the supernatants of SHP-1-deficient macrophages compared to wild-type macrophages. In addition, the protease ADAM8, which plays an important role in both trans-endothelial migration and proteolysis of myelin proteins by macrophages in inflammatory demyelinating diseases (2, 72, 93) , was also significantly higher in me=me macrophages compared to wild-type macrophages (Fig. 7H) . These data indicate that a given inoculation of either wild-type or me=me macrophages produces a greater replication rate of TMEV and generation of inflammatory molecules in SHP-1-deficient macrophages, which is likely to increase the demyelinating activity of these cells as they migrate into the CNS.",

These studies showed that TMEV-infected me=me glial cells and the CNS of TMEVinfected me=me mice produced increased amounts of the NF-kB-inducible chemokine MCP-1 (18) (Fig. 3) . Furthermore, we demonstrated that SHP-1-deficient macrophages displayed enhanced chemotaxis towards MCP-1 compared to wild-type macrophages (18) . To analyze the role of MCP-1 in the present studies, me=me mice were treated with an MCP-1-neutralizing antibody or a control IgG antibody at the time of IP TMEV inoculation, and clinical signs were recorded thereafter (Fig. 8A) . MCP-1 neutralization resulted in delayed onset of paralysis in infected me=me mice, suggesting that MCP-1 is an important mediator of inflammatory demyelination in SHP-1-deficient mice.

Taken together, SHP-1 controls both the number of macrophages entering the CNS and viral replication within macrophages, which in turn both contribute to the increased virus and inflammation seen in the spinal cords of me=me mice. We have shown that in SHP-1-deficient mice, following systemic TMEV infection, CNS viral entry is macrophagedependent. The fact that SHP-1 controls viral replication in macrophages and macrophage infiltration into the CNS may have general significance for understanding virus-induced CNS disease, especially where virus entry is macrophagemediated, such as in HIV, HTLV-1, or West Nile virus infections (47, 69, 73) . Furthermore, the observation that SHP-1 controls viral replication may have important implications in the pathogenesis of MS, since macrophages of MS patients display decreased SHP-1 levels. Therefore it will be important to investigate whether macrophages of MS patients are more susceptible to virus infections, or if they display increased innate activation following viral infection that would promote enhanced migration into the CNS.",

It is widely thought that the initiation of MS is the result of a systemic infection that causes proinflammatory cytokines to be released into the general circulation, subsequent upregulation of adhesion-related molecules on CNS endothelium, homing of leukocytes to the CNS vasculature, and infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes to CNS lesions. This hypothesis is supported by immunopathological descriptions of the MS brain, and corresponding observations from animal models of MS. Several researchers postulate that a viral infection might trigger MS (53) by several mechanisms in which the virus acts as an adjuvant, provides autoantigenic determinants of molecular mimicry, promotes epitope spreading, or causes persistent CNS infection and inflammation (65) . In support of these ideas, viral infection has been closely associated with MS onset by pathways that may be similar to those described for several viruses in MS animal models (68) .",

While useful to study events occurring subsequent to CNS infection, these models do not allow an examination of the steps leading up to demyelinating disease that unfold following virus infection at peripheral sites that may be important in the pathogenesis of MS. Therefore attempts have been made to identify particular viruses or appropriate susceptible mouse strains in which a peripheral viral infection can lead to central inflammatory demyelination.

Based on the important and diverse roles that SHP-1 has on macrophage biology, including controlling (1) the susceptibility to viral infections, (2) the production of inflammatory molecules, (3) the responsiveness to chemoattractive stimuli, and (4) the rate of phagocytosis, SHP-1 deficiency could potentially enhance several key steps leading up to macrophage-mediated demyelination, making SHP-1 an attractive target for the treatment of MS (Fig. 9) (18, 38, 43, 46, 67) . Indeed we have shown that monocyte-derived macrophages of MS patients have deficient levels of SHP-1 relative to those of normal control subjects (20) . Furthermore, we have shown that deficient levels of SHP-1 seen in macrophages in MS patients may be directly responsible for the increased activation of inflammatory transcription factors, as seen in SHP-1-deficient mice. In addition, we have shown that SHP-1 has interferon-b-inducible activity, and that SHP-1 induction following interferon treatment of MS patients attenuates the leukocyte inflammatory profile (17, 21) . These observations indicate that heightened SHP-1 expression may be a useful biomarker of drug efficacy in MS patients.",

It was previously shown that the CNS of the uninfected me=me mouse possess an intact BBB, and that the CNS contains normal numbers of monocytic cells (92) . Previous studies have shown that in response to inflammatory stimuli, macrophages of me=me mice secrete increased levels of chemokines compared to wild-type animals (31) . Thus MCP-1 produced by infected macrophages may constitute an initial stimulus to promote increased monocyte egress from the bone marrow into the blood of infected me=me mice in the present study, and as shown in previous studies (41, 58, 89) . Also, our previous studies showing that blocking MCP-1 in vitro significantly diminished macrophage migration in response to glial-derived MCP-1 indicates an additional role of MCP-1 in attracting blood-borne monocytes into the CNS (18) .",

Indeed, spin mice derived under sterile conditions and housed in a germ-free environment were entirely healthy until transferred to a nonsterile environment, in which these mice developed spontaneous inflammatory lesions in skin and lungs SHP-1 CONTROLS MACROPHAGE-MEDIATED TMEV NEUROINVASION commonly seen in me=me mice (24) . These observations indicate a two-step process in which SHP-1 deficiency in macrophages is a precondition to tissue-specific inflammation triggered by microbe-stimulated inflammatory signals. This scenario is in agreement with the present study, demonstrating that upon introduction of a neurotropic virus either directly into the CNS or at peripheral sites, inflammation via innate pathways ensues in the CNS. Thus a remaining question is the extent to which loss of SHP-1 in either peripheral macrophages or CNS-resident cells contributes to microbe-induced inflammation in the CNS. Our previous studies of direct CNS infection may indicate a role for dysregulation of innate responses to virus infection within CNS-resident cells (11, 60) . The answer to this important question awaits studies in which the role of SHP-1 in either peripheral myeloid or CNS-resident glia may be studied individually using targeted ablation in these populations in TMEV-infected mice.",

            "text": "FIG. 9. The potential mechanisms of inflammatory demyelination in SHP-1-deficient mice following systemic TMEV infection. (1) Following IP TMEV infection the virus activates immune cells to secrete cytokines and chemokines. Furthermore, TMEV selectively infects me=me macrophages, leading to macrophage activation. This cytokine storm leads to upregulation of several inflammatory molecules, including chemokines, proteases, and adhesion molecules. (2 and 3) Peripheral cytokines can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enter the CNS. This results in CNS resident cell activation, including microglia, astrocytes, and BBB endothelial cells, leading to the upregulation of several inflammatory mediators, including the chemokine MCP-1. (4) MCP-1 secreted from the CNS and the periphery can mediate monocyte egress from the bone marrow that can substantially increase the number of circulating monocytes. The majority of circulating monocytes are activated, as is evident by the high expression of the Ly6C marker. The fact that me=me mice secrete more MCP-1 following viral infection, and that SHP-1-deficient macrophages are more responsive to chemoattractive stimuli, leads to a substantially higher number of peripheral monocytes=macrophages in me=me mice compared to wt mice. (5) The increased number of circulating monocytes is attracted into the CNS, largely by the chemokine MCP-1. Monocytes entering the CNS introduce TMEV, a neurotropic virus, into the CNS. (6) TMEV disseminates into the CNS, infecting glial cells, neurons, and infiltrating macrophages. This leads to further inflammatory mediators being released into the CNS, and this in turn contributes to additional CNS macrophage infiltration. The CNS-infiltrating macrophages are very susceptible to TMEV infection, thereby contributing to the increased viral loads observed in the CNS of SHP-1-deficient mice. (7) Infiltrating macrophages can directly cause demyelination by myelin phagocytosis. Also, several inflammatory molecules expressed or secreted by infiltrating macrophages, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), proteases, or cytokines, can contribute to myelin degradation and oligodendrogliopathy my.",
