As control, we used OR6c cells from which the HCV genome had been removed by treatment with interferon-a. The UPR-autophagy pathways were activated to a greater degree in the OR6 cells as compared to the OR6c cells. Rapamycin, mTOR-independent autophagy inducer, activated HCV replication in the OR6 cells. On the other hand, HCV replication in the cells was inhibited by 3-methyladenine (3-MA), which is an inhibitor of autophagy. Salubrinal (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2(eIF2)-alpha phosphatase inhibitor), 3-ethoxy-5, 6-dibromosalicylaldehyde (X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1) splicing inhibitor) and sp600125 (c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) inhibitor) inhibited HCV replication and autophagy. Additionally, HCV replication and autophagy were inhibited more strongly by combination of these inhibitors. Conclusion: Our results suggest that UPR-autophagy pathways exert an influence on HCV replication. Therefore, control these pathways may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy against replication of HCV.",

Some groups have shown that HCV protein disrupts normal ER functions and induces ER stress [6, 7] . Mammalian cells trigger a response called the unfolded protein response (UPR) to cope with abnormal ER functions and ER stress [8] [9] [10] . UPR activates three distinct signalling pathways, namely, the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF-6) pathway, the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) pathway and the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway [11] [12] [13] . Some groups have reported the existence of some relationships among the three kinds of UPR-autophagy pathways [14, 15] . Autophagy is a major intracellular pathway involved in the degradation and recycling of long-lived proteins and cytoplasmic organelles, and plays an essential role in the maintenance of homeostasis in response to starvation and other cellular stresses [16] . On the other hand, autophagy also plays important roles in a variety of other cellular processes, including restriction of intracellular pathogen multiplication. Recently, the significance of autophagy in the establishment of virus infection has become clear; in particular, some positive single-strand RNA viruses utilize autophagy to generate the cytoplasmic membrane structures that they require for genome replication [17] . HCV has also been shown to induce ER stress and trigger UPR [18] [19] [20] [21] . Furthermore, UPR activation has been proposed to be responsible for subsequent induction of autophagy [22] . However, the induction of UPRautophagy pathways by HCV has not been defined elucidated yet.",

The amount of LC3-II was significantly increased in the OR6 cells as compared to the OR6c cells (Fig. 1A) . Autophagy is involved in the response to ER stress, which is represented by UPR; in this case, double-membrane vesicles are formed but do not fuse with the lysosomes. Accumulation of p62 has been reported to be caused by lysosomal fusion inhibition [14, 15] . Also, in our experiment, significant accumulation of p62 was observed in the OR6 cells (Fig. 1A ). Fig. 1B shows an increase in the amount of phosphorylated eIF2-alpha (Ser51) [9] in the OR6 cells as compared to the OR6c cells, suggesting that the PERK pathway was activated by HCV. Fig. 1C indicates the increase in the amount of spliced XBP1 in the OR6 cells as compared to the OR6c cells, suggesting that the ATF-6 and IRE1 pathways were activated too [10, 26] . Fig. 1D shows an increase in the amount of IRE1 in the OR6 cells as compared to the OR6c cells. Moreover, increases in the amounts of phosphorylated JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) and phosphorylated c-Jun (Ser63) were also observed in the OR6 cells as compared to the OR6c cells (Fig. 1D) , suggesting that the IRE1 pathway was activated as well [8] .",

To further investigate whether inhibition of the UPR-autophagy pathway might affect the rate of HCV replication, we determined the EC50, CC50 and SI values of Salubrinal (eIF2-alpha inhibitor), 3-E-5, 6-D (X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1) inhibitor) and sp600125 (JNK inhibitor) using the OR6 assay system. The results for the EC50, CC50 and SI values were as follows: (Salubrinal: EC50; 6.25 lM, CC50 > 100 lM, SI > 16 (Fig. 3A) , 3-E-5, 6-D: EC50; 2 lM, CC50; 20 lM, SI; 10 ( Fig. 3B ) and sp600125: EC50; 1 lM, CC50; 12.5 lM, SI; 12.5 (Fig. 3C) . Meanwhile, the percentage of viable cells was determined by the WST-1 assay. Cytotoxic effects were observed at >25 lM of the Salubrinal (Fig. 3A) , >6.25 lM of the 3-E-5, 6-D (Fig. 3B) , and >3.13 lM of the sp600125 (Fig. 3C) .",

Salubrinal inhibited phasphorylated eIF2-alpha, LC3-II and HCV core protein, but not inhibited spliced XBP1 and phasphorylated JNK. 3-E-5, 6-D and sp600125 inhibited phasphorylated JNK, spliced XBP1, LC3-II and HCV core protein, but not inhibited phasphorylated eIF2-alpha. Combined treatment with three inhibitors of Salubrinal, 3-E-5, 6-D and sp600125 strongly enhanced the inhibition of both HCV replication and autophagy. These results indicated that combined use of the inhibitors was more effective than use of any of the inhibitors alone in suppressing HCV replication and autophagy (Fig. 4) . In addition, the concentrations of each of the inhibitors used in combination did not affect the cell viability rate (Fig. 4) . Thus, in regard to the efficacy of inhibition for HCV replication and autophagy, combined use of 3-E-5, 6-D and sp600125 appears to be the most efficient as compared to use of other combinations.",

            "text": "On the other hand, several groups have reported that autophagy and/or autophagy genes are likely to play both antiviral and proviral roles in the life cycles and pathogenesis of many different virus families. Especially, replication and spread of some positive-strand RNA viruses are regulated by their interactions with the host autophagy machinery [17] . Components of the autophagic machinery seem to be subverted to promote replication of RNA viruses, such as in the case of infections with the coronavirus [mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)], poliovirus, or rhinoviruses 2 and 14, by generation of a membrane scaffold for RNA replication [32, 33] . We then attempted to determine if inhibitors of UPR signaling might control HCV replication and autophagy by inhibiting the signaling pathways from URP to autophagy (Figs. 2 and 3) . Our results showed that Salubrinal (eIF2-alpha phosphatase inhibitor), 3-E-5, 6-D (XBP-1 inhibitor) and sp600125 (JNK inhibitor) could regulate HCV replication and autophagy in the OR6 cells (Fig. 3) . Next, we attempted to determine combinated inhibitiors which UPR-autophagy pathways might have the greatest influence in the regulation of HCV replication. When the concentrations of the inhibitors used were under the EC50, the cell viability of the HCV replicons was almost 100%. In particular, combined treatment with the 3-E-5, 6-D (XBP-1 splicing inhibitor) and sp600125 (JNK inhibitor) was the most efficient at reducing HCV replication (Fig. 4) . Some interesting findings have been reported previously. eIF2-alpha phosphatase inhibits the assembly of the 80S ribosome and inhibits protein synthesis [34] . On the other hand, IRE1 and ATF6 promote transcription of the UPR target genes. IRE1 and ATF6 process XBP1 mRNA to generate mature XBP1 mRNA. Spliced XBP1 binds directly to the ER stress response element and unfolded protein response elements and activates transcription of the molecular chaperones of the ER. JNK activation, mediated by IRE1, is required for autophagosome formation [35] . The PERK pathway is independent of UPR, however, the IRE1 and ATF6 pathways play complementary roles in UPR signaling [36] [37] [38] . These findings indicate that inhibition of UPR-autophagy pathways may have significant influence in the suppression of HCV replication, and 3-E-5, 6-D and sp600125 might inhibit strongly HCV replication and autophagy.",

Salubrinal (eIF2-alpha phosphatase inhibitor), 3-E-5, 6-D (XBP-1 inhibitor) and sp600125 (JNK inhibitor) acted as a potent anti-autophagy agent and limit both inhibition of autophagy and HCV replication. We lead to the notion that HCV may hijack the UPR-autophagy pathway for HCV replication (Fig. 5 ). Our study demonstrates control of the UPR-autophagy pathway machinery as a possible antiviral drug target. Combined treatment with inhibitors of UPR signaling enhanced the inhibition of HCV replication. The effects of combined treatment with Salubrinal (eIF2-alpha phosphatase inhibitor), 3-E-5, 6-D (XBP-1 splicing inhibitor) and sp600125 (JNK inhibitor) on HCV replication in the OR6 assay system were examined. OR6 cells were treated with the reagents for 72 h, following which the RL assay (bar graph) and WST-1 assay (line graph) were performed. The relative values (%) calculated at each point, with the level in the non-treated cells set at 100%, are presented here. Western blot analysis of the treated cells for the HCV core protein and LC3 was also performed (lower panels). ",
