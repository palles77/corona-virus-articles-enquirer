Here we report the development of a secondgeneration MitoChip (v2.0) with oligonucleotide probes to sequence the entire mitochondrial genome. In addition, the MitoChip v2.0 contains redundant tiling of sequences for 500 of the most common haplotypes including single-nucleotide changes, insertions, and deletions. Sequencing results from 14 primary head and neck tumor tissues demonstrated that the v2.0 MitoChips detected a larger number of variants than the original version. Multiple coding region variants detected only in the second generation Mito-Chips, but not the earlier chip version, were further confirmed with conventional sequencing. Moreover, 31 variations in noncoding region were identified using MitoChips v2.0. Replicate experiments demonstrated >99.99% reproducibility in the second generation MitoChip. In seven head and neck cancer samples with matched lymphocyte DNA, the MitoChip v2.0 detected at least one cancer-associated mitochondrial mutation in four (57%) samples. These results indicate that the second generation MitoChip is a high-throughput platform for identification of mitochondrial DNA mutations in primary tumors. (J Mol",

The potential use and advantage of mitochondrial (mt)DNA mutations over nuclear genomebased methods for similar detection approaches is attributable to the large numbers of mutated, often homoplasmic, mitochondria found in single cancer cells. [3] [4] [5] Mitochondrial DNA mutations have been documented to exist in a wide range of human cancers including lung, colon, breast, prostate, and head and neck cancers and so forth. 3, 6, 7 This commonality of mitochondrial mutations in human cancers suggests that analysis of mitochondrial DNA mutation patterns may serve as a unique molecular approach to detection of all types of cancers. In addition, mitochondrial mutations are found in premalignant lesions 8 -10 and therefore offer an opportunity for early detection and screening of human cancer. Indeed, detection of mitochondrial DNA mutations, widely reported in clinical samples including body fluids and serum, possesses potential for early detection and screening of a variety of human tumors. 3, 11, 12 A high-throughput strategy for sequencing the mitochondrial genome is therefore required to translate the potential of mitochondrial mutations as a cancer biomarker to clinical practice.",

We have recently developed a human mitochondrial array-based sequencing platform for rapid and high-throughput analysis of mitochondrial DNA. 16 This first generation of Mi-toChip (MitoChip v1.0) was able to sequence both strands of the entire mitochondrial coding region in a single assay, demonstrating \u03fe99.99% reproducibility. However, a major limitation of the earlier version of Mito-Chip was its lack of tiling oligonucleotide probes for sequencing the mitochondrial displacement loop (Dloop). The D-loop is a noncoding region in the mitochondrial DNA molecule that controls both replication and transcription. Many of the somatic mitochondrial DNA mutations of primary tumors are found in the D-loop region. 17, 18 Additional conventional sequencing of the Dloop region is therefore required to provide a complete mitochondrial genomic profiling of cancer samples while using the MitoChip v1.0 as a screening tool.",

The major difference is that the v2.0 chips are tilled with oligonucleotide probes for the entire 16.5-kb sequence of mtDNA (Table 1 ). In addition, to increase sensitivity of mutation detection, redundant probes are tilled in the MitoChip v2.0 for 500 of the most common haplotypes as observed in the MitoMap public database (http://www. mitomap.org/; accessed April, 2004). The reduced feature size of 8 mol/L confers another advantage of the v2.0 MitoChips compared to the MitoChips v1.0 because it reduces oligonucleotide synthesis costs and decreases bleed through between adjacent tiled sequences. To evaluate the second generation MitoChip, we performed a comparison study between the v1.0 and v2.0 chips. The sequencing results of 14 primary tumor tissues demonstrated comparable sensitivity in the v2.0 MitoChips with \u03fe99.99% reproducibility, as reported previously for the v1.0 array. In addition, 31 variations in the D-loop region were successfully detected in the v2.0 chips. With sequencing of paired lymphocytes, somatic mtDNA mutations were detected in four of seven head and neck tumors with the MitoChip v2.0. The second generation MitoChip has thus proved to be a high-throughput sequencing microarray for sequencing the entire mitochondrial genome for early detection and clinical screening of human tumors.",

Briefly, RA tools uses an objective statistical framework to assign each genotype call a quality score, which is the difference between the log (base 10) likelihood of the best fitting and the second best fitting statistical model for assigning a genotype at any position on the sequencing array. The total quality score threshold (totThresh) is the quality score that a given base has to exceed to be called. Increasing this value requires increased support for base calls and, as a consequence, fewer bases are called. Bases that fail to reach this threshold are called \"N.\" The optimum total threshold quality score was determined empirically to be 12, which yields the highest base call rate with the lowest discrepancy between genotypes for replicate samples (see below). The original ABACUS algorithm and the RA tools version has been successfully applied for high-throughput variation detection in human and pathogenic organisms, 22,23 as well as for detection of mitochondrial sequence variations in human embryonic stem cells. 24 ",

            "text": "To evaluate the application of the v2.0 MitoChips, we first compared the sensitivity of variation detection between the v1.0 and v2.0 chips. Independent aliquots of the same PCR products were used for hybridization to both v1.0 and v2.0 MitoChips. For the comparison purposes, the use of the same PCR products was necessary to rule out any possibility of PCR-induced artifacts, although the polymerase used is known to have extremely high fidelity. Sequencing variants were identified by comparing to mitochondrial reference sequence (http://www.mitomap.org). A difference in sequence when compared to the reference sequence was referred to as variation. When a variation was present in matched normal tissues but absent in tumors, we termed these variations somatic mutations. Of the 120 variations, 75 were detected by both v1.0 and v2.0 MitoChips, and 17 variations were detected only in MitoChip v1.0, and the other 28 detected by MitoChip v2.0 only (Figure 1 ). From these comparison experiments the v2.0 MitoChips seem to exhibit a higher detection sensitivity. A question arises whether the variations detected in the v2.0 only were truly present or were an artifact of array-based sequencing. Since the MitoChip v1.0 has been evaluated before, 16 the 75 variations detected by both types of MitoChips should be real. Therefore, we randomly selected eight variations of the 28 variations only detected by v2.0 MitoChips and sequenced these by conventional dye terminator platform. All of the eight variations were confirmed in the conventional sequencing with 100% accuracy (Table 3) . It is worthy to note that 17 variations identified in v1.0 went undetected in v2.0 chips. This was mainly attributable to lack of ability to call some nucleotide positions in v2.0 chips (call rate of 94.2). As mentioned above, a new feature of the v2.0 MitoChip is its tiling of probes for detecting variations in the mitochondrial D-loop region. Indeed, 31 variations were detected in the v2.0 MitoChips (Figure 1 ). Of the 31 variations, 20 were homoplasmic and 11 were heteroplasmic. The criteria for the identification of heteroplasmic variations was based on the ability of the RA sequencing software to make a reliable call for MitoChip may be able to detect even low-level heteroplasmy. We sequenced all these 31 variations detected in D-loop region. Nineteen of twenty homoplasmic variations were confirmed by conventional dye terminator platform. Five of eleven heteroplasmic variations were confirmed, and the remaining six appeared to be homoplasmic variations. It has been known that the MitoChip possesses higher sensitivity compared to the conventional sequencing assay. As showed in Figure 2 , the heteroplasmic variation (C-C/T) in sample 2039 is clearly displayed in sequencing chromatogram. By examining the chromatograms two heteroplasmic variations were found to exist in sample 2075. However, in sample 2007, conventional sequencing detected a homoplasmic variation (A-G) rather than heteroplasmic variation (A-A/G) identified in MitoChip ( Figure 2 ). It is likely that this heteroplasmic variation is real but cannot be detected by conventional sequencing assay because of its low sensitivity. Further studies including dilution experiments may be needed to fully evaluate the ability of MitoChip v2.0 to detect heteroplasmic variations.",

The seven primary samples were randomly selected from those head and neck tumor DNAs used in the comparison experiments. The final average base call rates for the DNA obtained from the matched lymphocytes were essentially identical to that of the primary tumor DNA (between 94 to 95% call rate), demonstrating that DNA obtained from these clinical samples is feasible for use in chip-based assays. Overall, four of seven (57%) head and neck tumor DNAs demonstrated multiple mutations.

Indeed, three of the four samples with mutations were found to carry mutations in the D-loop. In tumor sample no. 2007, 15 mutations were detected, four of which were in the D-loop.

            "text": "Mitochondrial alterations have long been suspected as contributors to carcinogenesis. 26 This hypothesis has been supported by recent studies that demonstrate positive contribution of mitochondrial mutations in the tumor development. 27, 28 More importantly, accumulating data on mitochondria suggest that mitochondrial DNA mutations play a wide range of roles in cancer development and can be used as biomarkers to both diagnosis and prognosis of human cancers. Thus, development of rapid and reliable approaches to sequence mitochondrial DNA has become an important tool. Microarray-based resequencing technology is one of the current existing approaches for identifying unknown DNA variations, and has displayed higher sensitivity and automation capabilities compared to conventional sequencing technologies. 21, 29 We have previously developed oligonucleotidebased sequencing microarray and used them to successfully identify mtDNA mutations in human samples. 16 The purpose of this study was to develop a microarray platform for high-throughput analysis of the entire mitochondrial DNA sequence for identification of mutations in clinical samples. An important improvement of the redesigned second generation MitoChips is the tiling of the entire mitochondrial DNA (16,568 bp), thus allowing the sequencing of the entire mitochondrial genome on a single chip. In addition, redundant probes are tiled in the v2.0 MitoChip for 500 of the most common haplotypes in the mitochondrial sequence, which markedly increases the capacity for mutation detection. Moreover, we have made several modifications to optimize the whole procedure in the preparation of samples. These include 1) using same PCR program for all three reactions to amplify entire mtDNA, 2) using 150 ng of genomic DNA rather than 300 ng in the PCR reactions, and 3) reducing filling volume of chips. These improvements have greatly simplified the procedure and helped save samples and reagents. Previous studies demonstrated that the MitoChips v1.0 exhibit higher sensitivity compared to other sequencing assays. 16, 30 All of the 14 tumor samples were found to contain mtDNA variations with both v1.0 and v2.0 Mito-Chips. Analysis of coding region showed that the v2.0 MitoChips detected 11 more variations than the first generation MitoChips in the coding region ( Table 3 ). The increased sensitivity might be attributable to the redundant tiling of probes in the highly variable region of mitochondrial sequence. This increased sensitivity is of particular importance for the use of the MitoChips to the clinical purpose of diagnosis and prognosis of cancers. A limitation of the MitoChip v1.0 is its inability to detect variations in mitochondrial D-loop region. The D-loop region functions as a promoter for mitochondrial DNA, and alterations in this region may affect the transcription of mitochondrial genes. Accumulating data indicate the Dloop is a region frequently harboring mtDNA mutations in cancers. 3 A recent report demonstrates that mitochondrial D-loop mutations are associated with low survival rate of colon cancers. 31 Therefore, sequencing the Dloop part is necessary to explore biomarkers for early detection and prognosis of human tumors. To realize fully the high-throughput purpose, the redesigned MitoChip v2.0 includes probes for mitochondrial D-loop. Although preliminary, the data presented in the present study is promising in identification of variations in D-loop with v2.0 MitoChips. Further dilution experiments may prove the MitoChip v2.0 to be an excellent platform for identification of mtDNA variations present as a minority of analyzed DNA sample.",

Of the 47 assays, 14 tumor DNAs were sequenced with v1.0 MitoChip assays, the same DNA was also applied to v2.0 Mito-Chips for the purpose of comparison. Four samples selected from the original 14 samples were repeated with v2.0 MitoChips to examine the reproducibility of v2.0 chips. Each sample was repeated three times, thus a total of 12 comparisons was made to estimate the repro-ducibility of the v2.0 MitoChips. Finally, seven matched lymphocyte DNA samples (serving as normal control) were sequenced with the v2.0 MitoChips to identify the mutations. The same procedures for DNA fragmentation and hybridization were used for both v1.0 and 2.0 Mito-Chips. A different washing program was applied to the two versions of the MitoChips because of the different designs. Using a totThresh of 12, RA tools assigned a mean base call 96.8% (ranging from 95.8 to 97.8%) in v1.0 chips. For v2.0 chips the overall call rate across all of the chips was 94.6% (ranging from 89.2 to 96.8%) (",
