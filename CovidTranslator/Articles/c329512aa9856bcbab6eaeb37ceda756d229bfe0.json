The mean size of particles was controlled by spectrophotometric calibration, described previously [14] , and by transmission electron microscopy. The mean diameter of the resultant particles was 15.2 nm at their concentration of 1.6\u00d710 12 /ml. STG virus was conjugated with colloidal gold after evaluation of the golden number. Mice and rabbits were immunized with the resultant complex. Quantitative evaluation of the protective effect of polymers on liophobic colloids (specifi cally, on gold hydrosols) was fi rst proposed by Zsigmondi. This method is still most often used in studies in this sphere. The minimum protective amount of hydrophilic polymer suffi cient for prevention of clotting of 10 ml gold sol after addition of 1 ml 10% NaCl solution to it is determined. This amount of lipophilic polymer expressed in milligrams is called \"golden number\".",

Two main methods for biological macromolecules conjugation with colloidal gold are adsorption (used in our study) and hemadsorption. Each method has specifi c features as regards the preparation and use of conjugates. It is assumed that stabilization of gold colloids with biomolecules (functionalization) is realized by passive adsorption of the polymer on particles' surface due to electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Coulomb's interaction between lysine H 2 N groups and citrate ions on the surface of gold nanoparticles obtained by Frens' method [12] has been described. Recent studies revealed an important role of cystein molecule SH groups in the realization of protein binding to the surface of gold particles. Hence, preparation of a stable colloidal gold conjugate with STG is a result of the virus capside proteins interactions with the surface of gold nanoparticles by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and donor-acceptor bonds.",

It seems that the immunostimulatory (adjuvant) effect of this complex was due to stimulation of phagocytic cells, which improved antigen presentation by antibody-producing cells. We showed [1, 3, 4] that gold nanoparticles used as antigen carriers stimulated phagocytic activity of macrophages and modulated lymphocyte functioning, which presumably determined their immunomodulating effect. The most interesting aspect of manifestation of immunogenic properties by the antigens immobilized on gold nanoparticles was the fact that gold nanoparticles acted as both adjuvant and carrier, that is, presented the haptene to T-cells. The effect of gold nanoparticles conjugated with the antigen on T-cell stimulation was detected (a 10-fold increase of proliferation in compari son with that in response to the native antigen). This fact indicated the principal probability of purposeful stimulation of T-cells with subsequent stimulation of macrophages by them and extermination of the agent. These results will probably serve as the basic for the creation of antiviral vaccines with gold nanoparticles as antigen carrier and adjuvant.",
